Polhem (Polhammar) was born on the island of Gotland in the small village of [[Tingstäde]], situated northeast of [[Visby]].

Originally the Polhem family came from Austria to [[Pomerania]], Germany, from where his father, Wolf Christoph Polhammer traded with [[Visby]], where he would eventually settle down to become a skipper. In Stockholm he attended a German school until the age of 8 when his father died. His mother, Christina Eriksdotter Schening from [[Vadstena]], Östergötland remarried. As a result of conflicts with his stepfather, his private tuition was no longer paid for and Polhem was sent to live with his uncle in Stockholm. 

He took a job as a farmhand on Vansta, a property in [[Södertörn]], Stockholm.  He quickly rose to the position of supervisor, being responsible for supervision and accounting, for which he was well suited by his affinity for mathematics. He worked at Vansta for ten years, during which period he constructed a workshop where he made tools, repaired and constructed simple machinery to earn money.

Hungering for knowledge within his fields of interest, mathematics and mechanics, he soon realized that he would get no further without learning Latin. Self-studies were attempted, but given up; Polhem realized he needed a tutor. In exchange for constructing a complex clock, he was given Latin lessons by a local vicar.

Word of Polhem's mechanical skill spread quickly and a member of the clergy wrote the professor of mathematics at Uppsala University, Anders Spole to recommend Polhem. Spole, grandfather of [[Anders Celsius]], presented two broken clocks to Polhem and offered to let him study under him if he could repair them, Polhem repaired the clocks with no difficulty and began recovering years of lost education in 1687, at the age of 26.

He married [[Maria Hoffman]] in 1691, together they had two children, Gabriel and Emerentia.

In 1716 he was [[ennoblement|ennobled]] in gratitude of his services to the nation by the king and changed his name from ''Polhammar'' to ''Polheim'', which he later changed to ''Polhem''.

He and his son [[Gabriel Polhem]] were both elected members of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1739, the year the Academy was founded.

Polhem died of natural causes in 1751 in Stockholm.

According to Polhem's [[autobiography]], the event that marked the beginning of his career was the successful repair of the unfinished [[medieval]] (16th century) [[astronomical clock]] by [[Petrus Astronomus]] at [[Uppsala Cathedral]], which had remained unfinished and broken for more than a century.

In 1690 Polhem was appointed to improve upon the current [[mining operations]] of Sweden. His contribution was a construction for lifting and transporting [[ore]] from mines, a process that was rather risky and inefficient at the time. The construction consisted of a track system for lifting the ore, as opposed to wires; the construction was powered entirely by a [[water wheel]]. Human labor needed was limited to loading the containers. Being new and [[revolutionary]], word of Polhem's work reached the reigning king, [[Charles XI]] who was so impressed with the work that he assigned him to improve Sweden's main mining operation; the [[Falun]] Copper mine.

[[Image:Stora stöten.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Great Copper Mountain|Falun copper mine]] as it looks today.]]

Funded by the Swedish mining authority, Polhem traveled throughout Europe, studying mechanical development. He returned to Sweden in 1697 to establish ''laboratorium mechanicum'' in [[Stockholm]], a facility for the training of engineers, as well as a laboratory for testing and exhibiting his designs. It has since become the prestigious [[The Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]], whose history began with king [[Charles XI]] and his praise for Christopher Polhem for his mining efforts.

His greatest achievement was an automated factory powered entirely by water; automation was very unusual at the time. Built in 1699 in [[Hedemora Municipality|Stjärnsund]], the factory produced a number of products, deriving from the idea that Sweden should export fewer raw materials and process them within their own borders instead. The factory was a failure; it met great resistance among workers who feared they would be replaced by machinery. Eventually most of the factory was destroyed in a fire in 1734, leaving only the part of the factory that produced clocks. The factory continued producing clocks, known for their high quality and low price. Although the popularity of the clocks diminished during the beginning of the 19th century, clock-making continues to this day at Stjärnsund, still producing around twenty clocks of the Polhem design per year.

Another product from the factory was the Scandinavian padlock ("Polhem locks", Swedish: Polhemslås), essentially the first design of the variation of [[padlock]]s common today. Economically, the factory was unfeasible, but the king at the time, [[Charles XII]], was supportive and gave Polhem freedom from taxes to encourage his efforts.

The factory of Stjärnsund was visited by one of his contemporaries, [[Carl Linnaeus]], who wrote about the factory in his diaries as ''Nothing is more optimistic than Stjärnsund'' (''"Intet är spekulativare än Stjärnsund"'').

Polhem also contributed to the construction of [[Göta Canal]], a canal connecting the east and west coasts of Sweden. Together with [[Charles XII of Sweden]], he planned the construction of parts of the canal, particularly the [[canal lock]]s in the 18th century; it was not to be finished until 1832, long after his death.

Other major contributions made by Polhem were the constructions of [[dry dock]]s, [[dam]]s and as mentioned before, [[canal lock]]s, which he designed together with his assistant and friend, [[Emanuel Swedenborg]].

===Other fields===

Polhem was not only active within the field of mechanics, he actively wrote essays concerning [[medicine]], [[social criticism]], [[astronomy]], [[geology]] and [[economics]].

{{'}}'''Conjoint analysis'''{{'}} is a survey-based statistical technique used in market research that helps determine how people value different attributes (feature, function, benefits) that make up an individual product or service.

The objective of conjoint analysis is to determine what combination of a limited number of attributes is most influential on respondent choice or decision making. A controlled set of potential products or services is shown to survey respondents and by analyzing how they make preferences between these products, the implicit valuation of the individual elements making up the product or service can be determined. These implicit valuations (utilities or part-worths) can be used to create market models that estimate market share, revenue and even profitability of new designs.

Conjoint originated in [[mathematical psychology]] and was developed by marketing professor [[Paul E. Green]] at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]]. Other prominent conjoint analysis pioneers include professor [[V Srinivasan|V. "Seenu" Srinivasan]] of Stanford University who developed a linear programming (LINMAP) procedure for rank ordered data as well as a self-explicated approach, Richard Johnson who developed the Adaptive Conjoint Analysis technique in the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = Richard M. | last = Johnson | title = History of ACA | booktitle = Proceedings of the Sawtooth Software Conference | date = September 2001 | location = Victoria, BC, Canada | url = http://www.sawtoothsoftware.com/support/technical-papers/conference-proceedings/proceedings2001 | pages = 205–212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jordan Louviere (University of Iowa) who invented and developed choice-based approaches to conjoint analysis and related techniques such as [[best–worst scaling]].

Today it is used in many of the social sciences and applied sciences including [[marketing]], [[product management]], and [[operations research]]. It is used frequently in testing customer acceptance of [[new product development|new product designs]], in assessing the appeal of [[advertising|advertisements]] and in [[service design]]. It has been used in [[positioning (marketing)|product positioning]], but there are some who raise problems with this application of conjoint analysis.

Conjoint analysis techniques may also be referred to as multiattribute compositional modelling, discrete choice modelling, or stated preference research, and is part of a broader set of trade-off analysis tools used for systematic analysis of decisions. These tools include Brand-Price Trade-Off, [[Simalto]], and mathematical approaches such as [[Analytic hierarchy process|AHP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A comparison of analytic hierarchy process and conjoint analysis methods in assessing treatment alternatives for stroke rehabilitation|vauthors=Ijzerman MJ, van Til JA, Bridges JF|year=212|pmid=22185216|doi=10.2165/11587140-000000000-00000|volume=5|journal=Patient|pages=45–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary algorithms]] or [[rule-developing experimentation]].

== Conjoint design ==
A product or service area is described in terms of a number of attributes. For example, a television may have attributes of screen size, screen format, brand, price and so on. Each attribute can then be broken down into a number of levels. For instance, levels for screen format may be LED, LCD, or Plasma.

Respondents would be shown a set of products, prototypes, mock-ups, or pictures created from a combination of levels from all or some of the constituent attributes and asked to choose from, rank or rate the products they are shown. Each example is similar enough that consumers will see them as close substitutes, but dissimilar enough that respondents can clearly determine a preference. Each example is composed of a unique combination of product features. The data may consist of individual ratings, rank orders, or preferences among alternative combinations.

As the number of combinations of attributes and levels increases the number of potential profiles increases exponentially. Consequently, [[fractional factorial design]] is commonly used to reduce the number of profiles that have to be evaluated, while ensuring enough data are available for statistical analysis, resulting in a carefully controlled set of "profiles" for the respondent to consider.

== Types ==
The earliest forms of conjoint analysis were what are known as Full Profile studies, in which a small set of attributes (typically 4 to 5) are used to create profiles that are shown to respondents, often on individual cards. Respondents then rank or rate these profiles. Using relatively simple [[Dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]] [[regression analysis]] the implicit utilities for the levels can be calculated. Two drawbacks were seen in these early designs.

Firstly, the number of attributes in use was heavily restricted. With large numbers of attributes, the consideration task for respondents becomes too large and even with fractional factorial designs the number of profiles for evaluation can increase rapidly. In order to use more attributes (up to 30), hybrid conjoint techniques were developed. The main alternative was to do some form of self-explication (rating of separate components) before the conjoint tasks and some form of adaptive computer-aided choice over the profiles to be shown.

The second drawback was that the task itself was unrealistic and did not link directly to behavioural theory. In real-life situations, the task would be some form of actual choice between alternatives rather than the more artificial ranking and rating originally used. Jordan Louviere pioneered an approach that used only a choice task which became the basis of [[choice-based conjoint analysis]] and [[discrete choice analysis]]. This stated preference research is linked to [[econometric modeling]] and can be linked to [[revealed preference]] where choice models are calibrated on the basis of real rather than survey data. Originally choice-based conjoint analysis was unable to provide individual level utilities as it aggregated choices across a market. This made it unsuitable for market segmentation studies. With newer hierarchical [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] analysis techniques, individual level utilities can be imputed back to provide individual level data.

== Information collection ==
Data for conjoint analysis are most commonly gathered through a market research survey, although conjoint analysis can also be applied to a carefully designed [[configurator]] or data from an appropriately designed [[test market]] experiment. Market research rules of thumb apply with regard to statistical sample size and accuracy when designing conjoint analysis interviews.

The length of the research questionnaire depends on the number of attributes to be assessed and the method of conjoint analysis in use. A typical adaptive conjoint questionnaire with 20-25 attributes may take more than 30 minutes to complete{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}. Choice based conjoint, by using a smaller profile set distributed across the sample as a whole may be completed in less than 15 minutes. Choice exercises may be displayed as a store front type layout or in some other simulated shopping environment.

==Analysis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
[[File:Sample-output-of-conjoint-analysis.png|thumb|Sample output of conjoint analysis with application to marketing (a choice-based experiment on ice-cream performed on [http://www.conjoint.online/ Conjoint.ly])]]
Depending on the type of model, different econometric and statistical methods can be used to estimate utility functions. These utility functions indicate the perceived value of the feature and how sensitive consumer perceptions and preferences are to changes in product features. The actual estimation procedure will depend on the design of the task and profiles for respondents, in the type of specification, and the scale of measure for preferences (it can be ratio, ranking, choice) which can have a limited range or not. For rated full profile tasks, [[linear regression]] may be appropriate, for choice based tasks, [[maximum likelihood estimation]], usually with [[logistic regression]] are typically used. The original methods were monotonic analysis of variance or linear programming techniques, but contemporary marketing research practice has shifted towards choice-based models using multinomial logit, mixed versions of this model, and other refinements. [[Bayesian estimator]]s are also very popular. Hierarchical Bayesian procedures are nowadays relatively popular as well.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
===Advantages===
* estimates psychological tradeoffs that consumers make when evaluating several attributes together
* measures preferences at the individual level
* uncovers real or hidden drivers which may not be apparent to the respondent themselves
* realistic choice or shopping task
* able to use physical objects
* if appropriately designed, the ability to model interactions between attributes can be used to develop needs based segmentation

===Disadvantages===
* designing conjoint studies can be complex
* with too many options, respondents resort to simplification strategies
* difficult to use for product positioning research because there is no procedure for converting perceptions about actual features to perceptions about a reduced set of underlying features
* respondents are unable to articulate attitudes toward new categories, or may feel forced to think about issues they would otherwise not give much thought to
* poorly designed studies may over-value emotional/preference variables and undervalue concrete variables
* does not take into account the number items per purchase so it can give a poor reading of market share

==Practical applications==

===Market research===

One practical application of conjoint analysis in business analysis is given by the following example: A real estate developer is interested in building a high rise apartment complex near an urban Ivy League university. To ensure the success of the project, a market research firm is hired to conduct focus groups with current students. Students are segmented by academic year (freshman, upper classmen, graduate studies) and amount of financial aid received. Study participants are given a series of index cards. Each card has 6 attributes to describe the potential building project (proximity to campus, cost, telecommunication packages, laundry options, floor plans, and security features offered). The estimated cost to construct the building described on each card is equivalent. Participants are asked to order the cards from least to most appealing. This forced ranking exercise will indirectly reveal the participants' priorities and preferences. Multi-variate [[regression analysis]] may be used to determine the strength of preferences across target market segments.

===Litigation===

Federal courts in the United States have allowed expert witnesses to use conjoint analysis to support their opinions on the damages that an infringer of a patent should pay to compensate the patent holder for violating its rights.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell University v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 609 F. Supp. 2d 279 (N.D.N.Y. 2009); Sentius Int'l, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., No. 5:13-cv-00825, 2015 WL 331939 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 23, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, legal scholars have noted that the Federal Circuit's jurisprudence on the use of conjoint analysis in patent-damages calculations remains in a formative stage.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gregory Sidak &amp; Jeremy O. Skog, ''Using Conjoint Analysis to Apportion Patent Damages'', (Criterion Economics Working Paper, Jan. 29, 2016), https://www.criterioneconomics.com/using-conjoint-analysis-to-apportion-patent-damages.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prieur worked in the intelligence-gathering and evaluation wing of the French Secret Service, the Direction Générale de la Sécurité Extérieure ([[DGSE]]). She was an expert in European peace organisations and was the controller for [[Christine Cabon]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Cabon was posted to [[Auckland]] in April 1985, where she infiltrated the [[Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand|Greenpeace]] office and gathered information for Prieur and her fellow agent [[Alain Mafart]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/about/history/the-bombing-of-the-rainbow-war/rainbow/|title=A beret, a bottle of Beaujolais and a baguette|website=Greenpeace International|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1985, Prieur and Marfart entered New Zealand from Corsica on Swiss passports issued to their aliases Sophie and Alain Turenge, a newlywed couple on honeymoon.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Their instructions were to sink the ''Rainbow Warrior'' as the French government suspected that it would be used to protest the upcoming nuclear tests at [[Mururoa atoll]] in the South Pacific.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Prieur's responsibilities were the logistics of the operation, and the evacuation of the agents from the country after the bombing had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=4850|title=Saboteur spills the French beans|date=2000-06-30|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prieur and Marfart delivered [[limpet mine]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to two [[Frogman|frogmen]] to plant on the ship's hull on the night of 10 July 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/defence/news/article.cfm?c_id=32&amp;objectid=3007440|title=The day Operation Satanic came to NZ|date=2002-12-03|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The explosions sank the vessel and killed photographer [[Fernando Pereira]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Prieur's husband, Joel Prieur, an employee of the Defense Department, was posted to Hao shortly after she was exiled there.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/profile/Susan%20Barnum/clipnumber/38949/|title=France Ends Agent's Exile|last=|first=|date=7 May 1988|work=Cedar Rapids Gazette|access-date=4 May 2016|via=Newspaper Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 May 1988 she was returned to France because she was pregnant, and was heralded as a national hero.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/profile/Susan_Barnum/clipnumber/38952/|title=Spy: French Leader Ordered Sinking|last=|first=|date=11 July 2005|work=Daily Herald Suburban Chicago|access-date=4 May 2016|via=Newspaper Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; She never returned to Hao.

Although a UN Arbitration panel found that France had breached its obligation to New Zealand several times by removing the agents from Hao, and failing to return them, it rejected the claim by New Zealand to have Mafart and Prieur returned because the term they should have spent there had already lapsed.

=== Later career ===

In 1989, Prieur was promoted to Major,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3LtFS3rl9MC&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;dq=%22Dominique%20Prieur%22&amp;pg=PA304#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dominique%20Prieur%22&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Cold War Espionage, Spies, and Secret Operations|last=|first=|publisher=Enigma Books|year=2009|isbn=9781929631759|editor-last=Trahair|editor-first=Richard C.

Prieur published a book ''"Agent secrète"'' (''Secret Agent'') in 1995 concerning her role in the bombing. With regards to the death of Pereira, she wrote "We were terrified and appalled ... We hadn't come here to kill anyone."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2005, Prieur and Marfart appealed to the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|New Zealand Supreme Court]] to stop footage of their guilty pleas being shown on television.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=20060927B012114112&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Ship Bombers Lose TV Appeal|last=|first=|date=27 September 2006|work=Gold Coast Bulletin|subscription=yes|access-date=4 May 2016|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supreme court allowed the footage to go on the air.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2009, Prieur was hired as the director of human resources for the [[Paris Fire Brigade]], a unit of the [[French Army]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10656664|title=Rainbow Warrior: Where Are They Now?|last=|first=|date=5 July 2016|work=New Zealand Herald|access-date=4 May 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff (4 January 2009) "Fresh Start for Saboteur" ''Sunday Mail'' (South Australia) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Rathbone Bacon''' (born in Le Roy, New York on November 22, 1848) was president of a railroad, lawyer and financier.  His father was David Rinaldo Bacon and his mother was Elizabeth Rathbone. He had four siblings, Walter Rathbone, Lathrup Rufus, John Ganson, and Mary Sibley Bacon. Bacon never married or had children. Bacon served as the vice-president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and as the president of the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railroad. He also worked as a lawyer and financier.&lt;ref name="Railway Age Gazette"&gt;{{cite book|title=Railway Age Gazette|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j39NAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1110|year=1915|publisher=Railway Age Gazette, Incorporated|page=1110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesmachine.nytimes.com"&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/12/12/104018253.html?pageNumber=40 ''New York Times'' December 12, 1915]&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon died on December 2, 1915 in Baltimore, Maryland as a result of an appendicitis operation he had a week earlier.&lt;ref name="New York Times December 3, 1915"&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1915/12/03/106733508.html?pageNumber=11 ''New York Times'' December 3, 1915]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon's main residence was 247 5th Avenue, New York, where he lived with his brother Walter and his sister-in-law [[Virginia P. Bacon]].&lt;ref name="New York Times December 3, 1915"/&gt; He is also reported to have lived in Buffalo for a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |jstor=25588752 |newspaper=American Art News |date= December 11, 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon worked out of an office at 2 Wall Street in New York.&lt;ref name="American Publishers' Association"&gt;{{cite book|title=Herringshaw's American Blue-book of Biography: Prominent Americans of ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4IxIAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA45|year=1914|publisher=American Publishers' Association|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled often to Europe, which is where he purchased many of the works that made up his extensive art collection.&lt;ref&gt;''Memorial Catalog of Paintings by Old and Modern Masters, Collected by Edward R.

==Career==

Edward Bacon was educated at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire.&lt;ref name="Railway Age Gazette"/&gt; In 1869 he was admitted to the Bar in Buffalo, New York.&lt;ref name="LeonardMarquis1907"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John William Leonard|author2=Albert Nelson Marquis|title=Who's who in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-UUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA65|year=1907|publisher=Marquis Who's Who|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon lived and worked in Buffalo for a time, where he "achieved success as a lawyer."&lt;ref name="New York Times February 2, 1896"&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1896/02/02/108221572.html?pageNumber=2 ''New York Times'' February 2, 1896]&lt;/ref&gt; In around 1881 he moved to New York City and became Vice-President of the Cincinnati, Washington, &amp; Baltimore Railroad.&lt;ref name="New York Times December 3, 1915"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times February 2, 1896"/&gt; From 1890 to 1902 he was the President of the Cincinnati, Washington, and Baltimore Railroad, which was later called the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Trains/ICC valuations/Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railroad]]. In fact, "it was through his efforts that the Cincinnati, Washington &amp; Baltimore branch of the road was built," according to Bacon's ''New York Times'' obituary.&lt;ref name="New York Times December 3, 1915"/&gt; In 1896 he was appointed as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]].

Bacon counseled various railway companies in law matters before and during his posts at Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railroad and Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.&lt;ref name="Railway Age Gazette"/&gt; In 1881 he joined the firm Field, Dorsheimer, Deyo, and Bacon.&lt;ref name="New York Times February 2, 1896"/&gt; The companies he counseled include [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] Company, [[Consol Energy|Consolidated Coal Company]], [[Pittsburgh and West Virginia Railway|West Virginia and Pittsburgh Railroad Company]], and [[Vicksburg, Shreveport and Pacific Railway|Vicksburg, Shreveport &amp; Pacific Railroad Company]].&lt;ref name="LeonardMarquis1907"/&gt; Bacon was known as "one of the best-known financiers in the country."&lt;ref name="New York Times December 3, 1915"/&gt;

Additional posts include director of the Farmer's Loan and Trust Company, director of the Inter-borough Rapid Transit Company in New York, director of Knickerbocker Apartment Company, director of the Kansas City Southern Railway, and of the Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton Railway.&lt;ref name="Railway Age Gazette"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times December 3, 1915"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electric Railway Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kKdMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1016|year=1917|publisher=McGraw Hill Publishing Company|page=1016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art collection==
Edward Bacon owned an extensive collection of [[Old Master]] paintings and Chinese art objects. He was private about his collecting, and he "never consented to lend pictures from his collection for public exhibition." &lt;ref name="Modern Masters 1919"&gt;''Memorial Catalog of Paintings by Old and Modern Masters'', Collected by Edward R. Bacon, Prepared by James B. Townsend and W. Stanton Howard (New York: The Devinne Press, 1919).&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''American Art News'' published after Bacon's death stated that "It is passing strange that no journal, in the many obituaries of Edward R. Bacon that have been widely published as of late, has even alluded to him as an art collector, and yet he was well known to the art world as an art lover and collector of note."&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite news |jstor=25588750|newspaper=American Art News|date=December 11, 1915|volume=14|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacon began collecting about 25 years before his death.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;  It started in an "unostentatious way...rather as an accessory to contribute in some dignified way to the appearance of his home.&lt;ref&gt;''Memorial Catalogue of Chinese Art Objects, Including Porcelains, Potteries, Jades, Bronzes, and Cloisonne enamels'', Collected by Edward R. Bacon, Prepared by James B. Townsend and W. Stanton Howard. Introduction by John Getz (New York: The Devinne Press, 1919), xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon was generally interested in collecting works by the Old Masters and Chinese art objects. He was interested in "the quaint and loveable" and preferred "light and gay" pictures, and anything "full of vivacity."&lt;ref name="Modern Masters 1919"/&gt; He first collected paintings from well-known artists of his day, and then moved on to French 18th century works. Next, he began collecting 18th century English portraits. Later, he turned to the Italian primitives, a group "that does not attract the uncultivated."&lt;ref name="Modern Masters 1919"/&gt; In reference to his collection of Chinese art, John Getz wrote that Edward Bacon was "among those connoisseurs who long ago recognized the beauty and intrinsic worth of Chinese art as manifested in ceramics, cloisonné, bronze…"&lt;ref name="Chinese Art Objects 1919"&gt;''Memorial Catalogue of Chinese Art Objects, Including Porcelains, Potteries, Jades, Bronzes, and Cloisonne enamels, Collected by Edward R. Bacon'', Prepared by James B. Townsend and W. Stanton Howard. Introduction by John Getz (New York: The Devinne Press, 1919).&lt;/ref&gt; Getz also mentioned a "reliable agent abroad" who aided Bacon in discovering and purchasing these artworks. He could possibly be referring to Mr. Eugene Fischhof of Paris, who is known to have worked with Bacon.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Bacon kept his collection in the Upper East Side apartment he shared with his brother and sister-in-law.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Notable works in Bacon's collection included:

*''The Four Seasons'' by [[François Boucher]]
*''Portrait of Mrs. Hart'' by [[Henry Raeburn]] 
*''Portrait of Rigaud'' by [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]]
*''Señorita Tuzo'' by [[Francisco Goya]]

In 1919 a catalog detailing all works in Bacon's collection was published in limited quantity.&lt;ref name="Modern Masters 1919"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chinese Art Objects 1919"/&gt; The catalog's creation was the idea of his sister-in-law, [[Virginia P. Bacon]], though she did not live to see the two-volume catalog published. An ''American Art News'' reporter wrote, in a review of the books, that "The catalogs have a literary character and differ from the ordinary sale and collection catalogs in that they give interesting pen pictures of the works listed and illustrated, and copious footnotes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|jstor= 25589666 |newspaper=American Art News |title=Review: John Zoffany: His Life and Works |date=June 26, 1920|volume=18|number=36|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club memberships and society presence==
[[File:Edward R. Bacon.png|thumb|Edward R. Bacon, as pictured in the ''Railway Age Gazette'' obituary]]

Bacon was a member of many New York clubs, including the Manhattan Club, Union Club, the Metropolitan Art Museum, the Tuxedo Club, the New York Yacht Club, and the Racquet and Tennis Club.&lt;ref name="New York Times December 3, 1915"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=40303215 |title=Members of the Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |date=March 1, 1905|number=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Academy of Political Science in New York in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=1193326 |title= List of Members |journal=Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science in the City of New York |date=October 1912|volume=3|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon also held box 18 at the Metropolitan Opera on odd Mondays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=20543696| title=List of Box-Holders at the Opera |journal=The Lotus Magazine|date=December 1915 |volume=7 |number=3 |pp=139–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of several automobile-centered clubs, such as the Automobile of America, and the Royal Automobile Club of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Motor Cyclopaedia, Sport, Industry and Trade. ...: Year Book ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xi06AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA7|year=1908|publisher=E.E.

In addition, Bacon was a well-known man in both the United States and England. He was included in ''Who's Who in America'' in 1907, in ''Herringshaw's American Blue Book of Biography'' in 1914, and in ''Who's Who in New York City and State'' in 1914.&lt;ref name="American Publishers' Association"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeonardMarquis1907"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Who's who in New York City and State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5exHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA28|year=1914|publisher=L.R. Hamersly Company|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 an article in the ''New York Times'' states that Edward Bacon could not attend a large charity ball in London, as he had "left the Ritz" and was "sailing for New York" after having recovered from an automobile accident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/01/26/100250616.html?pageNumber=38 ''New York Times'' January 26, 1913]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and estate==
Bacon died at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland on December 2, 1915. His death was due to complications after an operation for appendicitis.&lt;ref name="New York Times December 3, 1915"/&gt; Sources estimate that his estate was worth $2,000,000 at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=25588759 |journal=American Art News |date=December 18, 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made bequests totaling around $1,000,000 to relatives an employees, and specified that the rest of the estate, including his collection of paintings, be shared equally between his brother Walter R. Bacon and his sister-in-law Virginia P. Bacon.&lt;ref name="timesmachine.nytimes.com"/&gt; Bequests included $400,000 to both his sister Mrs. Mary B. Allen and his brother John G. Bacon, and his cousins and nieces each received $50,000 and $40,000, respectively. He also bequeathed varying sums to his cook, secretary, valet, footman, and maids.&lt;ref name="timesmachine.nytimes.com"/&gt;

'''Ernest Gaston Joseph Solvay''' ({{IPA-fr|sɔlvɛ|lang}}; 16 April 1838 &amp;ndash; 26 May 1922) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[chemist]], [[industrialist]] and [[philanthropist]].

Born at [[Rebecq]], he was prevented by acute [[pleurisy]] from going to university. He worked in his uncle's chemical factory from the age of 21.

In 1861, he developed the [[ammonia-soda process]] for the manufacturing of [[soda ash]] (anhydrous [[sodium carbonate]]) from brine (as a source of [[sodium chloride]]) and [[limestone]] (as a source of [[calcium carbonate]]). The process was an improvement over the earlier [[Leblanc process]].

He founded the company [[Solvay (company)|Solvay &amp; Cie]] and established his first factory at [[Charleroi|Couillet]] (now merged into [[Charleroi]], [[Belgium]]) in 1863 and further perfected the process until 1872, when he patented it. Soon, [[Solvay process]] plants were established in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany and Austria. Today, about 70 Solvay process plants are still operational worldwide.

The exploitation of his [[patent]]s brought Solvay considerable wealth, which he used for [[philanthropic]] purposes, including the establishment in 1894 of the "Institut des Sciences Sociales" (ISS) or Institute for Sociology at the [[Free University of Brussels]] (now split into the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]), as well as [[Solvay Conference|International Institutes for Physics and Chemistry]]. In 1903, he founded the [[Solvay Business School]] which is also part of the [[Free University of Brussels]]. In 1911, he began a series of important conferences in physics, known as the [[Solvay Conference]]s, whose participants included luminaries such as [[Max Planck]], [[Ernest Rutherford]], [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie]], [[Henri Poincaré]], and (then only 32 years old) [[Albert Einstein]]. A later conference would include [[Niels Bohr]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Max Born]], and [[Erwin Schrödinger]].

He was twice elected to the [[Belgian Senate]] for the [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal Party]] and granted honorary title of [[Minister of State (Belgium)|Minister of State]] at the end of his life. [[Solvay, New York]] and [[Rosignano Solvay]], the locations of the first Solvay process plants in the United States and in Italy, are also named after him.

Solvay died at [[Ixelles]] at the age of 84 and is interred there in the [[Ixelles Cemetery]].

[[File:Friedrich Flick Nuremberg.JPG|thumb|200px|Friedrich Flick during the [[Nuremberg Trials]]]]

'''Friedrich Flick''' (born 10 July 1883 in [[Kreuztal|Ernsdorf]], [[Siegerland]]; died 20 July 1972 in [[Constance]]) was a German [[industrialist]] and convicted [[Nazi war criminal]]. After the war, he reconstituted his businesses, becoming the richest person in [[West Germany]], and one of the richest people in the world, at the time of his death in 1972.

He initially built a fortune during [[World War I]] and became extremely wealthy during the [[Weimar Republic]], establishing a major industrial conglomerate in the [[coal]] and [[steel]] industries.

==War crimes==
The Flick trial was one of the 12 [[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials]] of the military, political, and economic leadership of Nazi Germany, held after the [[Nuremberg trials]] (the "Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal"), the most well-known trials which tried 22 of the most important captured Nazis. Like the other trials, the Flick trial took place at the [[Palace of Justice (Nuremberg)|Palace of Justice]].

The defendants in this case were Friedrich Flick and five other high-ranking directors of Flick's group of companies, ''Flick [[Kommanditgesellschaft]]'', or ''Flick KG''. The charges centered on [[slave labor]] and plundering, but Flick and the most senior director, [[Otto Steinbrinck]], were also charged for their membership in the "Circle of Friends of Himmler." The circle was a group of influential German industrialists and bankers&amp;mdash;founded in 1932 by [[Wilhelm Keppler]] and taken over by Himmler in 1935&amp;mdash;for the purpose of giving financial support to the Nazis. Its members "donated" annually about 1 million [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]] to a "Special Account S" in favor of [[Heinrich Himmler]].

==Later career==
Despite being found guilty in the [[Nuremberg]] [[Flick Trial]], and being sentenced to seven years, including time already served, he quickly became one of West Germany's richest people by the 1950s and the largest shareholder of [[Daimler-Benz]]. He was awarded numerous honours, including the Grand Cross with Star and Sash of the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] in 1963 and the [[Bavarian Order of Merit]], and was an honorary senator of the [[Technical University of Berlin]]. At the time of his death, his industrial conglomerate encompassed 330 companies and around 300,000 employees.

His heirs were his son [[Friedrich Karl Flick]] and his grandson [[Friedrich Christian Flick]], who established the modern art gallery [[Friedrich Christian Flick Collection]].

'''Gabriel Marselis''' (1609 &amp;ndash; 15 April 1673) was a Dutch tradesman and land owner. He was born in [[Hamburg]], the son of merchant [[Gabriel Marselis, Sr.]] (c. 1575&amp;ndash;1643), and was a brother of [[Selius Marselis]]. He settled in [[Amsterdam]] in 1634. His trading with King [[Christian IV]] of [[Denmark-Norway]] was partly paid with the Crown's properties and goods. Marselis thus became the owner of several iron works and copper works in Norway, and also became one of the largest landowners in Denmark and Norway. Among his sons were Vilhelm, Baron and ancestor of the noble family [[Güldencrone (noble family)|Güldencrone]], and [[Constantin Marselis|Constantin]], Baron of [[Marselisborg]] and [[Constantinsborg]] at [[Aarhus]] in Denmark.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Gabriel Marselis D.Y.|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Anne-Hilde |last=Nagel |authorlink= |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Gabriel_Marselis_D.Y./utdypning |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Gabriel Marselis |first=Marius A |last=Mardal |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor-last=Godal | editor-first=Anne Marit | editor-link=Anne Marit Godal |publisher=Norsk nettleksikon |location=Oslo |url=http://snl.no/Gabriel_Marselis|language=Norwegian|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Powell Barnes''' (20 September 1856 &amp;ndash; 9 December 1949), generally referred to by his full name or as "George P.

Merry was a storekeeper in [[Toowoomba]], with whom George worked earlier and whose daughter, Mary Cecelia was married to George in 1879.  Barnes and Co was formed to control businesses in Warwick, [[Allora, Queensland|Allora]], [[Yangan, Queensland|Yangan]] and Roma Street and Commonwealth Flour Mills at [[Warwick, Queensland|Warwick]] and [[South Brisbane, Queensland|South Brisbane]].&lt;ref name=qhr&gt;{{cite QHR|15731|Barnes and Co. Trading Place|600956|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a leading figure in the Warwick Methodist Church and the Warwick Ambulance Brigade.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2630">Graduate Enrollment Management (GEM) is an area of [[Enrollment management]] focused on graduate and professional education.

==History==
In 2013, the [[National Association of Graduate Admissions Professionals]] (NAGAP), changed its name to [[NAGAP]], The Association for Graduate Enrollment Management and in 2014 the term started to gain more traction, appearing in publications from both NAGAP and [[American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers]] (AACRAO)&lt;ref&gt;https://aacrao-web.s3.amazonaws.com/files/ERRrFKrUSgKa26VLIPL2_CUJ8903_WEB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nagap.org/about-nagap|title=About NAGAP - NAGAP|website=www.nagap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
In 2014, NAGAP rolled out the following definition for graduate enrollment management: 
graduate enrollment management is a systematic approach to managing enrollment and the graduate student lifecycle from awareness to alumnus by integrating the core functions associated with the support of a graduate student. GEM represents a synthesis of traditional student support areas into seamless, cross-functional operations designed to integrated stakeholders, consolidate key assessment mechanisms, and bolster service levels.

A longer definition of GEM followed: 
graduate enrollment management (GEM) represents a comprehensive approach to the methods by which an institution recruits, admits, supports, retains, and graduates post-baccalaureate students in their respective degree programs.  This dynamic paradigm includes codependent functions working congruently to strategically manage overall enrollment levels and the student experience.  These include enrollment planning, marketing, recruitment and admissions, advisement/coaching, financial aid, student services, retention, and alumni relations.  

Regardless of staffing levels, integrated interdependence in GEM will ideally create an environment whereby a cross-trained professional from a graduate office is able to support a student throughout their time at the institution.  This approach creates an environment that sustains differentiated student experiences.

==Organizations==
A number of organizations focus on the field of GEM. Some of the more prominent organizations are:&lt;br&gt;
[[American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers]]&lt;br&gt;[[NAGAP]], the Association for Graduate Enrollment Management &lt;BR&gt;

[[National Association of Student Personnel Administrators]]

[[Image:IICROAD.jpg|thumb|250px|I. I. Chundrigar Road]]

'''I. I. Chundrigar Road''', formerly '''McLeod Road''', is located in the [[Central business district|financial hub]] of [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]. It is named after former Pakistani Prime Minister [[I. I. Chundrigar]].

The Karachi financial area is the largest in the country, referred to as "Pakistan's Wall Street".&lt;ref name="nadeemf.paracha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1134284|title=Visual Karachi: From Paris of Asia, to City of Lights, to Hell on Earth|author=Nadeem F.

In 1963, [[Habib Bank Plaza]] was built on this street which remained the tallest building of Pakistan until 2005.&lt;ref name="nadeemf.paracha"/&gt; 

In 2007 Sharjah-based Enshaa Holdings in a joint venture with NLC launched Karachi International Financial center on II Chundrigar road which would comprise a hotel, office towers, serviced apartments and a railway station. The Karachi Financial Towers would include two identical 37-storey towers connected by a three-floor glass skybridge. As of 2012, construction has been abandoned because of financial misappropriation and possible embezzlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/480015/nlc-lost-rs1b-in-glitzy-twin-towers-project-audit/|title=NLC lost Rs1b in glitzy twin towers project: Audit - The Express Tribune|date=15 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indian Readership Survey''' (IRS) is the largest continuous readership research study in the world with an annual sample size exceeding 2.56 lakh (256,000) respondents. IRS collects a comprehensive range of [[Demography|demographic]] information and provides extensive coverage of consumer and product categories, including cars, household appliances, household durables, household care and personal care products, food and beverages, finance and holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mruc.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=15&amp;Itemid=31 |title=Media Research Users Council - IRS Introduction - Providing In-depth Research Knowledge to Media Buyers &amp; Sellers |publisher=Mruc.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IRS]] is not restricted to survey of readership alone but is synonymous with both readership &amp; consumption across various FMCG ([[Fast-Moving Consumer Goods]]) products throughout [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mruc.net/index.php?option=com_easyfaq&amp;Itemid=93 |title=Media Research Users Council - IRS FAQ |publisher=Mruc.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; IRS covers information on over 100 product categories. IRS is conducted by MRUC (Media Research Users Council) and RSCI (Readership Studies Council of India).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/irs-2013-has-shocking-anomalies-defying-logic/article5640030.ece |title=IRS 2013 has shocking anomalies defying logic |publisher=The Hindu |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
IRS was launched in the year 1995 with an objective of setting an industry standard for readership &amp; other media measurement, &amp; to provide insights on media &amp; product consumption as well as consumer behavior patterns. In the year 1995-96, 23 Metro Reports were released followed by the All India Report consisting of urban and rural data. Simultaneously a software programme was developed to not just enable the optimum use of raw data but to also carry out multi media planning which provided a common basis of media evaluation.Over the years IRS has evolved to be very progressive, covering a broad spectrum of categories from Media data, [[Demographics of India|Indian Demographics]], Indian Market, Product Profiles, to the recently developed Telecom Report, TV Report, and IRS Countryside. Apart from a range of products offered new changes have been introduced in the method of classification of sub-regions from SCR’s to ISD’s, which is a more microscopic view of the consumer profile based on the socio−cultural [[ethnicity]]. From a user’s perspective, a few introductions in the form of participative sampling, customized queries have been introduced. Sub Metro level reporting for a better understanding of the consumer behavior patterns across different zones in the Metros &amp; Edition wise reporting is the other recent introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mruc.net/index.php?option=com_easyfaq&amp;Itemid=93 |title=Media Research Users Council - IRS FAQ |publisher=Mruc.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
IRS covers nearly 70 cities, 1178 towns and 2894 villages with the coverage being reviewed before the start of every round. The universe for IRS has been defined as the total resident urban and rural population of India aged 12 years and over. The survey excludes the off-shore territories such as [[Lakshadweep]] and [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. North Eastern states (excluding [[Assam]]) and [[Jammu and Kashmir]] (excluding [[Srinagar]]) are also excluded from the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mruc.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=35 |title=Media Research Users Council - IRS Methodology |publisher=Mruc.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sampling===
* The annual sample spread exceeds 2.56 lakh (256,000) respondents with continuous fieldwork spread across 10 months of the year
* Sample allocated proportionate to 12 years+ Universe of a geographic unit 
* More than 1 Lakh towns are sampled
* All publication towns and districts are sampled in the four rounds
* Remaining towns and non-publication districts are randomly sampled
* Rural Sampling: Once a district is selected, 2 [[Talukas]] from the district are randomly sampled

===Universe projection and weightlifting===
* The IRS data is weighted to the [[census]] universe
* Since the Census is conducted every ten years, the estimated population for any given date is calculated by using the growth rate in between two census points.
* Projection of Universe = the midpoint date of the Fieldwork period.
* E.g. for FW period Jan to December the Population of India is projected to June using CDGR. (Cumulative Daily Growth Rate) Universe projections of over 1000 sub-units is accrued to arrive at the All India Universe.
* Each weighting unit is divided into a number of weighting cells to create a weighting matrix for projecting the data.

===Household and individual collection===
* The first Household in a cluster is randomly selected based on the electoral rolls
* Remaining Households selected using Right Hand Rule
* Individual selection made using [[Kish grid]]
* Kish grid designed to maintain age X gender proportion in the sample.

==Significance==
IRS is the single source survey for media and product ownership/usage. The prime objective of the study is to collect readership information from a cross-section of individuals, in great detail, so as to present a true and unbiased picture of their readership habits. On the media front, it also captures information on television and cinema viewing habits, radio listening habits and Internet usage. In addition to this, IRS captures information on various FMCG ([[Fast-moving consumer goods|Fast Moving Consumer Goods]]) products, usage and consumption and durable ownership amongst households. Since media and product ownership/ consumption information is captured from the same household, it enables linkages between the media and product data. IRS equips you with information that is truly reflective of the Indian population for making informed decisions.&lt;ref name="hansaresearch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hansaresearch.com/about_irs.asp |title=Indian Readership Survey (IRS) |publisher=Hansaresearch.com |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Leading newspaper groups of India have jointly condemned the 2013 Indian Readership Survey, calling it badly flawed demanding withdrawal of the survey and a change in [[methodology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/18-top-papers-rubbish-readership-survey-findings/articleshow/29674900.cms |title=18 top media houses rubbish readership survey findings - The Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2014-01-31 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Hays Hammond''' (31 March 1855 &amp;ndash; 8 June 1936) was a [[mining engineer]], [[diplomat]], and [[philanthropist]]. Known as the man with the [[Midas touch]], he amassed a sizable fortune before the age of 40.  An early advocate of deep mining, Hammond was given complete charge of [[Cecil Rhodes]]' mines in [[South Africa]] and made each undertaking a financial success. But after the dismal failure of the [[Jameson Raid]], Hammond, along with the other leaders of the [[Reform Committee (Transvaal)|Johannesburg Reform Committee]], was arrested and subsequently sentenced to death.  The Reform Committee leaders were released after paying large fines, but like many of the leaders, Hammond left Africa for good.  He returned to the United States, became a close friend of President [[William Howard Taft]], and was appointed a special [[United States Ambassador]].  At the same time, he continued to develop mines in [[Mexico]] and [[California]] and, in 1923, he made another fortune while drilling for oil with the [[Burnham Exploration Company]].  His son, [[John Hays Hammond, Jr.]], patented over 400 inventions, and is widely regarded as the father of ''radio control''.

==Early life==
Hammond was the son of Major Richard Pindell Hammond, a [[West Point]] graduate who fought in the [[U.S.-Mexican War|Mexican War]], and Sarah, daughter of Harmon Hays and his wife, née Elizabeth Cage. Sarah was sister to Captain [[John Coffee Hays]] of the [[Texas Rangers Division|Texas Rangers]], and had formerly been married to Calvin Lea.&lt;ref name="time10may1926"&gt;{{cite magazine| author =| date=May 10, 1926| title=Unique|magazine=[[Time Magazine]]| volume=| issue=| issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The family moved in 1849 to California to prospect in the [[California gold rush]], and young John was born in San Francisco. After an adventuresome boyhood in the [[American Old West]], Hammond went East to attend the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] of Yale University, where he earned a Bachelor of Philosophy in 1876, and later attended the Royal School of Mines, Freiberg, Germany, 1876–1879, and there he met his wife-to-be, Natalie Harris.

==Mining career==
Hammond took his first mining job as a special expert for the [[US Geological Survey]] 1879-1880 in Washington, DC. He returned to California in 1881 to work for Senator Hearst, the mining magnate and father of [[William Randolph Hearst]].  In 1882, he was sent to hostile country in [[Mexico]], near [[Sonora]], to become superintendent of Minas Neuvas.  When a revolution broken out, Hammond barricaded his family in a small house and fought off the attacking guerrillas.

From 1884-1893, Hammond worked in San Francisco as a consulting engineer for Union Iron Works, Central Pacific Railway and Southern Pacific Railway.  In 1893, Hammond left for South Africa to investigate the gold mines in Transvaal for the Barnato Brothers. In 1894, he joined the [[British South Africa]] Company to work with [[Cecil Rhodes]] and opened mines in the Rand, in [[Mashonaland]] (territory which became [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]). In 1895, he was managing Rhodes' property in [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], with headquarters at [[Johannesburg, South Africa]].  An early advocate of deep-level mining, Hammond was given complete charge of Rhodes' gold and diamond mines and made each undertaking a financial success. While working for Rhodes, he made his worldwide reputation as an engineer. He continued to work for Rhodes until 1899, but events in Africa would go on to change Hammond's life forever.

===Reform Committee of Transvaal===
[[Image:Natalie Harris Hammond.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Natalie Harris Hammond&lt;/center&gt;]]
When Hammond arrived in the Transvaal, the political situation was tense. The gold rush had brought in a considerable foreign population of workers, chiefly British and American, whom the Boers referred to as "Uitlanders" (foreigners).  These immigrants, manipulated by Rhodes, formed a [[Reform Committee (Transvaal)|Reform Committee]] headed by Colonel [[Francis William Rhodes|Frank Rhodes]] (brother of Cecil), Hammond, and others. They demanded a stable constitution, a fair franchise law, an independent judiciary, a better educational system, and charged that the Government under President [[Paul Kruger]] had made promises, but failed to keep them. These demands were orchestrated by Rhodes, knowing that Kruger would never accede to them, justifying subsequent intervention by the British government to protect the supposed interests of British miners, the vast majority of whom had no desire to vote or settle in the Transvaal. Civility finally collapsed when [[Leander Starr Jameson]], the [[British South Africa Company]]'s Administrator General for [[Matabeleland]], prematurely invaded the Transvaal with 1 500 troops in the ill-fated [[Jameson Raid]] and was captured by the Boers in December 1895. Shortly thereafter, the Boer government arrested Hammond and most of members of the Reform Committee and kept them in deplorable conditions.  The U.S. Senate petitioned President Kruger for clemency.

The Reform Committee case was heard in April.  Hammond, [[Lionel Phillips]], [[George Farrar]], Frank Rhodes and [[Percy Fitzpatrick]], all of whom had signed an incriminating  document found with Jameson's raiders, were sentenced to be hanged, but Kruger commuted the sentence the next day. For the next few weeks, Hammond and the others were kept in jail under deplorable conditions.  In May it was announced that they would spend 15 years in prison, but by mid-June Kruger commuted the sentences of all, Hammond and the other lesser figures each paying a ₤2,000 fine. The ringleaders had been shipped off to London to be dealt with by the imperial Government, paying fines of ₤25,000 each. All fines, amounting to some ₤300,000, were paid by Rhodes. Shortly hereafter, Hammond left for England.

===Return to United States===
[[File:French ambassador's residence.JPG|thumb|Former residence of John Hays Hammond in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
About 1900, the now famous Hammond moved to the U.S., and reported on mining properties in the U.S. and Mexico. He reported on the value of the [[Camp Bird Mine]] in Colorado, pursuant to its sale in 1902. His report on [[Winfield Scott Stratton]]'s Independence mine, also in Colorado, and then being floated on the London market, revealed that the ore reserves had been greatly overvalued, and burst the stock bubble. He became a professor of mining engineering at Yale University 1902-1909, and from 1903–1907, he was employed by [[Daniel Guggenheim]] as a highly paid general manager and consulting engineer for the [[Guggenheim Exploration Company]] (Guggenex).

Hammaond's five-year contract included a $250,000 base salary and "an interest from each property that he brought in to Guggenex."  He earned $1.2 million in the first year alone.  He employed Pope Yeatman, his eventual successor at Guggenex, and [[Alfred Chester Beatty]].&lt;ref name=Hawley&gt;{{Cite book |author=Charles Caldwell Hawley |title=A Kennecott Story |publisher=The University of Utah Press |year=2014 |pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
In 1907, Hammond became the first president of the [[Rocky Mountain Club]] and he remained president of the club until it disbanded in 1928.&lt;ref name="nyt19jan1907"&gt;{{cite journal| author = | date=January 19, 1907 | title=Rocky Mountain Club Incorporates| journal=[[New York Times]]| volume=| issue=| issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt4mar1928"&gt;{{cite journal| author = | date=March 4, 1928| title=Rocky Mountain Club Ends a short but famous career; Its Huge Gifts of Money and Services in the War Gave It a Notable Record| journal=[[New York Times]]| volume=| issue=| issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hammond was also active in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and he became a close friend of President [[William Howard Taft]] whom he had known since his student days at Yale.&lt;ref name="hamptons1apr1910"&gt;{{cite journal| author =Benjamin B Hampton | date=April 1, 1910 | title=The Vast Riches of Alaska | journal=Hampton's Magazine | volume=24 | issue=1 | issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 1908 it was announced that Hammond was a candidate for Vice-President for the Republican party, but he did not receive many delegates at the national convention.&lt;ref name="hamptons1apr1910"/&gt; Nevertheless, he became acquainted with many prominent politicians at the convention and became the president of the League of Republican Clubs.&lt;ref name="hamptons1apr1910"/&gt;  He moved to Washington to be closer to the President and he accompanied President Taft on many excursions.&lt;ref name="hamptons1apr1910"/&gt;  In 1911, Taft then sent him to the coronation of [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] as a special U.S. Ambassador, and twice sent him to assist [[Nicholas II of Russia]] on irrigation and other engineering problems.  In addition to Taft, Hammond also befriended Presidents Grant, Hayes, Roosevelt, and Coolidge.
 
Hammond became chairman the U.S. Coal Commission, 1922-1923.  His close friendship and longtime business associations with [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], the highly decorated Scout who he knew from Africa, led Hammond to become a wealthy oil man when Burnham Exploration Company struck oil at [[Dominguez Oil Field]], near [[Carson, California]], in 1923.

== May 1926: A Celebration of Hammond ==
[[Image:John hays hammond time 10may1926.jpg|left|100px|thumb]]
In May 1926, an organization called "The Company of Friends of John Hays Hammond" sponsored eleven dinners around the world ([[Manhattan]], [[San Francisco]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Tokyo]], [[Manila]], etc.) in honor of Hammond.  Over 10,000 people wrote tributes to Hammond, including: Hearst whose father gave him his first job, [[Woolf Barnato]] whose father ([[Barney Barnato]]) took him to South Africa, Sir [[Lionel Phillips]] who was condemned to death with him, the Guggenheims who employed him at a fabulous salary, former President Taft who offered him an ambassador position, and President [[Calvin Coolidge]] who consulted with him on the coal situation.  The event was so extraordinary that ''[[Time Magazine|''Time'' magazine]]'' put Hammond on the cover of the May 10, 1926 issue and ran a biographical sketch on him called "Unique".&lt;ref name="time10may1926"/&gt;

He died of coronary occlusion on June 8, 1936, in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]].

==Family==
[[Image:Hammond jr hammond sr 2.jpg|thumb|John Hays Hammond Jr. &amp; Sr., c. 1922]]
He married Natalie Harris, of Harrisville, Mississippi (40 miles SSW south of the state capital, Jackson) on January 1, 1881, in Hancock, Maryland. Together they had three sons and one daughter:

[[John Hays Hammond, Jr.]] (1888 - February 12, 1965) was born in San Francisco, California.  In 1893 he moved with his family to South Africa, and five years later the family moved to England.  The family returned to the United States in 1900, and Hammond attended Lawrenceville School, started inventing, and went on to study at the Sheffield School of Yale University, graduating in 1910.  He established the Hammond Radio Research Corporation in 1911 and eventually developed a radio controlled torpedo system for the navy, which he successfully demonstrated in 1918.  Between 1926 and 1929, he built a medieval-style castle in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="castle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hammondcastle.org |work= |title=Hammond Castle &amp; Museum | accessdate=December 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natalie Hays Hammond]] (1904–1985) was born in Lakewood, New Jersey. Her estate in [[North Salem, New York]] was converted into the Hammond Museum &amp; Japanese Stroll Garden in 1957.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hammondmuseum.org |work=|title=Hammond Museum &amp; Japanese Stroll Garden | accessdate=December 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris Hays Hammond, a financier, became president of Dominguez Oil Fields Company, which earned him $2 million in 1936, and president of Laughlin Filter Corporation, a small New Jersey company which manufactures centrifuges. In 1928, he and [[Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Jr.|Anthony "Tony" Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr.]] were among the directors of Acoustic Products Co., which later became Sonora Products Corp. of America.&lt;ref name="time16aug1937"/&gt;

Nathaniel Harris Hammond, died 1906, and [[Richard Pindle Hammond]], composer, born in London, England, were the two other children.

John Hays Hammond died in 1936 at the age of 81 in an easy chair in his showplace at Gloucester, Massachusetts. He left an estate estimated at $2.5 million, mostly to his four surviving children: inventor John Hays Hammond Jr.; artist Natalie Hays Hammond; composer Richard Pindle Hammond; and financier Harris Hays Hammond.&lt;ref name="time16aug1937"&gt;{{cite magazine| author = | date=August 16, 1937| title=Millennium Payment|magazine=[[Time Magazine]]| volume=| issue=| issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Alencar Gomes da Silva''' ({{IPA-pt|ʒuˈzɛ ɐlẽˈkaʁ ˈɡõmiz dɐ ˈsiɫvɐ}}; 17 October 1931 – 29 March 2011) was a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] businessman and politician who served as the [[Vice President of Brazil]] from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2010. In business from a young age, Alencar became a self-made multimillionaire as the chief executive of [[Coteminas]], a leading [[textile manufacturer]]. In the 1990s, Alencar groomed his son to succeed him at the company.

He opted to enter politics in his home state, [[Minas Gerais]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/592936-fundada-por-alencar-coteminas-e-uma-das-maiores-empresas-texteis-do-pais.shtml | title=Fundada por Alencar, Coteminas é uma das maiores empresas têxteis do país | accessdate=29 March 2011 | date=23 July 2010 | publisher=[[Folha de S. Paulo]] | language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alencar had a business-oriented political platform, advocating [[market liberalization]] and [[deregulation]] of [[Production (economics)|production]]. His expensive political campaigns received hefty funds from Coteminas. After a failed run in 1994 for governor of Minas Gerais, he won the election in 1998 as Senator representing his home state.

In 2002, Alencar was invited by the left-wing [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] to run for Vice President on the same ticket as [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]. The alliance between the leftist union leader and Alencar, an experienced entrepreneur, proved successful. They won the presidential elections in [[Brazilian presidential election, 2002|2002]] and were re-elected in [[Brazilian presidential election, 2006|2006]]. Over the years, Lula da Silva and Alencar developed a close and affectionate friendship. Diagnosed with cancer of the [[stomach cancer|stomach]] and [[kidney cancer|kidney]] in 1997, Alencar died of the disease in 2011.

Alencar came to be revered among journalists and politicians for his spirited personality and friendly demeanor. He overcame his lack of formal education. Based on his business success, he argued in favor of lower taxes, especially [[indirect taxation]] over consumers, and a simpler [[tax system]]; lower [[interest rates]] and greater oversight of the [[banking industry]]; and [[social welfare]] and assistance programs. As Vice President, Alencar sometimes spoke out against his own government's [[orthodox economics|orthodox policies]], causing embarrassment for fellow administration members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://veja.abril.com.br/280503/p_042.html | title=O vice que ruge | accessdate=31 March 2011 | date=28 May 2003| publisher=[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]] | language=Portuguese| author=Maurício Lima}}&lt;/ref&gt; His unwavering determination to live in the face of terminal cancer also marked public perception, during and after his time in office.

==Personal life and early political career==
[[File:José Alencar e Dom Freire Falcão.jpg|thumb|left|Alencar [[Hand-kissing|kissing the hand]] of Cardinal [[Freire Falcão]], the archbishop of [[Brasília]]|200px]]
Alencar was born into a family of small entrepreneurs from [[Muriaé]], in the inland state of [[Minas Gerais]] on 17 October 1931. He was the eleventh son of Antônio Gomes da Silva and Dolores Peres Gomes da Silva. As a child, he was a [[Boy Scout]].

He started working while still a child, dropping out of primary school to help his father in the family business. He worked with his older brothers for years before becoming an independent successful businessman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escoteiros.org.br/noticias/noticia_detalhe.php?id=159], ''Escoteiros''&lt;/ref&gt; For a time he worked as a [[:wikt:travelling salesman|travelling salesman]] and in [[food industry|food]] wholesale start-ups.

==Marriage and family==
After getting established, Alencar married Mariza Gomes in 1957. They had three children together. Their two daughters are Maria da Graça and Patrícia. Their son Josué took over the presidency of Coteminas after his father went into politics.

As a result of a case filed by Rosemary de Morais, a 55-year-old retired teacher, in July 2010 the court ruled that Alencar needed to recognize her as his daughter. (The case may be appealed.)&lt;ref name="paternidade"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/mat/2010/07/22/justica-determina-que-vice-presidente-jose-alencar-reconheca-paternidade-917221984.asp | title=Justiça determina que vice-presidente José Alencar reconheça paternidade | accessdate=29 March 2011 | date=22 July 2010 | publisher=[[O Globo]] | language=Portuguese | author=Marcelo Portela}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://odia.terra.com.br/portal/brasil/html/2010/7/juiz_determina_que_alencar_reconheca_filha_de_55_anos_98207.html | title=Juiz determina que Alencar reconheça filha de 55 anos (Justice rules that Alencar recognize his daughter of 55 years) | accessdate=29 March 2011 | date=23 July 2010 | publisher=[[O Dia]] | language=Portuguese | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726225711/http://odia.terra.com.br/portal/brasil/html/2010/7/juiz_determina_que_alencar_reconheca_filha_de_55_anos_98207.html | archivedate=26 July 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had refused to undergo [[DNA testing]] but, according to [[Brazilian law]] 12.004/2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2007-2010/2009/Lei/L12004.htm | title=LEI Nº 12.004, DE 29 DE JULHO DE 2009. | accessdate=16 April 2011 | date=29 July 2009 | publisher=[[President of Brazil]] | language=Portuguese | author=[[Tarso Genro]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; this refusal is accepted as evidence of [[Paternity (law)|paternity]].

==Career==
[[File:José Alencar e Lula.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Alencar (right) with [[President Lula]].]]
Alencar eventually turned his family's small clothes factory and retail store into a major business. In 1967, he founded [[Coteminas]], which he would lead to become one of Brazil's largest textile manufacturers.&lt;ref name=UOL&gt;{{cite web | url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/2011/03/29/dono-da-coteminas-alencar-ajudou-lula-a-superar-resistencia-do-empresariado.jhtm | title=Dono da Coteminas, Alencar ajudou Lula a superar resistência do empresariado | accessdate=29 March 2011 | date=29 March 2011 | publisher=[[Universo Online]] | language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced goods for traditional brands in its portfolio, such as Artex, Santista and Calfat. He vied for dominance of the global market after a merger with [[South Carolina]]-based [[Springs Industries]].

After decades as a businessman, Alencar decided to enter politics and prepared his son to take over his leadership of Coteminas. He ran for governor of Minas Gerais in 1994. Although he was not successful, in 1998 he was elected as Senator from Minas Gerais. While in the Senate, Alencar worked on several Commissions, including the Senatorial Commission for Economic and Social Matters.

In 2002, he left the presidency of his company, by then a leading player with roughly 850 million [[Brazilian real|reais]] in yearly [[net sales]], to his son Josué Gomes da Silva. 
Alencar ran for Vice President of Brazil, tapped to be Lula's running mate, to assuage worries about the candidate's alleged anti-business bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://exame.abril.com.br/revista-exame/edicoes/0924/noticias/ele-nao-esta-mais-sozinho-m0165419 | title=Ele não está mais sozinho | accessdate=29 March 2011 | date=7 August 2008 | publisher=[[Exame]] | language=Portuguese | author=Larissa Santana | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719173126/http://exame.abril.com.br/revista-exame/edicoes/0924/noticias/ele-nao-esta-mais-sozinho-m0165419 | archivedate=19 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.coteminas.com.br/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=ciatecidos/ciatec/ing/ri/invatu.htm | title=Coteminas Investor Relations | accessdate=29 March 2011 | publisher=[[Coteminas]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the honorary President of the center-right [[Liberal Party (Brazil)|Liberal Party]].

At the end of 2005, Alencar left his party to associate with the new [[Brazilian Republican Party]], whose founders included Bishop [[Marcelo Crivella]] of the [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]], a large and growing evangelical church in Brazil and other countries.&lt;ref name=UOL/&gt; Crivella is also a Senator representing Rio de Janeiro in the federal government.

==Vice Presidency (2003-2010)==

[[File:Alencar speech.jpg|thumb|left|Alencar giving a speech on [[women's rights]] at the Palácio do Planalto]]
In office, Alencar aligned with another successful businessman in the cabinet, Luiz Fernando Furlan, to channel the demands of Brazilian businessmen. They voiced discontent with bureaucracy, insufficient infrastructure and cautious [[monetary policy]]. His efforts led to the strengthening of Apex-Brasil, a pro-export agency seen as instrumental in the [[Economy of Brazil|Brazilian economy]]'s recent rise in exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diariosp.com.br/_conteudo/2011/03/51608-a+despedida+do+guerreiro.html | title=A despedida do guerreiro | accessdate= 31 March 2011 | date=30 March 2011 | publisher=[[Diário de S.

Alencar was the most notable person in government to openly complain of the [[Fiscal conservatism|conservative]] monetary policies of the [[Brazilian Central Bank]], under [[Henrique Meirelles]], backed by ministers [[Antonio Palocci]] and [[Paulo Bernardo]]. He often criticized his own administration for failing to lower the Central Bank's [[Bank base rate|base interest rates]] and demanded a reform of the country's tax system.

In November 2004 he was sworn in as [[Ministry of Defence (Brazil)|Defense Minister]], following the resignation of [[José Viegas Filho]]. Lula turned to him to occupy the position. Alencar tried to resign on several occasions, claiming that a businessman would hardly be the best choice for running a nation's [[Military of Brazil|military forces]]. President Lula convinced him to stay until March 2006, when Alencar resigned his ministerial post, in favor of anti-graft activist [[Waldir Pires]].&lt;ref name=OGLOBO&gt;{{cite web | url=http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/mat/2011/03/29/alencar-critico-da-politica-economica-de-lula-empresario-de-sucesso-924115902.asp | title=Alencar, crítico da política econômica de Lula e empresário de sucesso | accessdate=29 March 2011 | date= 31 March 2006 | publisher=[[O Globo]] | language=Portuguese| author=Giancarlo Lepiani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/interna/0,,OI943803-EI1194,00.html | title=Governo anuncia nome de cinco novos ministros | accessdate=29 March 2011 | date=31 March 2006 | publisher=Terra | language=Portuguese| author=Giancarlo Lepiani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his disagreements with some policies of the [[Lula administration]], Alencar was officially invited by Lula to be his running mate in the [[Brazilian general elections, 2006|2006 general elections]]. With Lula's re-election victory on 29 October, Alencar secured his position as Vice President for another term. Alencar adopted a lower tone, while still espousing his traditional positions. He sought to run for the Senate in 2010, but was forced to give up due to the advanced stage of his cancer disease.

==Disease and death==
[[File:Alencar com Dilma e Lula no Sírio-Libanês.jpg|thumb|left|Alencar, visited by Presidents Lula and Rousseff, receiving anticancer treatment at [[Sírio-Libanês Hospital]] in São Paulo, December 23, 2010.]]
On a routine [[check-up]], José Alencar was diagnosed with [[stomach cancer|stomach]] and [[kidney cancer]] in 1997. After undergoing treatment for some length of time, he had his right kidney and two-thirds of his stomach surgically removed. Five years later, a malignant tumor in his [[prostate]] was removed. As the disease had [[metastasized]], it continued to spread, and in 2006 doctors discovered a [[sarcoma]] in his [[abdomen]]. On 26 January 2009, a surgery extirpated eight tumors, along with compromised portions of his [[small intestine|small]] and [[large intestine]]s and the [[ureter]]s.{{double image|right|Jose Alencar Velorio1.jpg|200|José Alencar velório.jpg|200|An honor guard carrying the casket of José Alencar up the ramp of the [[Planalto Palace]] in [[Brasília]], March 30, 2011.|Alencar lying in state in the Noble Room of the Planalto Palace. From left to right: the widow Mariza, their son Josué, then-President [[Dilma Rousseff]], former President Lula and the former First Lady [[Marisa Letícia]] (kissing Alencar).}} He was treated for [[digestive hemorrhage]] in December 2010 with urgent surgery, his last as Vice President. Doctors could not remove the tumors in his abdomen because of the number of operations to which he had already been subjected – eighteen in all. Alencar received [[chemotherapy]] for many years. He was mostly treated at [[Hospital Sírio-Libanês]], in [[São Paulo]]. He also received experimental treatment at the [[M.D. Anderson Cancer Center]] in [[Houston]], Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://terramagazine.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI5035001-EI6578,00-Alencar+passou+anos+lutando+contra+o+cancer.html | title=Alencar passou 13 anos lutando contra o câncer | accessdate=31 March 2011 | date=29 March 2011 | publisher=Terra | language=Portuguese |author=Dayanne Sousa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/591407-acompanhe-a-evolucao-da-doenca-de-jose-alencar.shtml | title=Acompanhe a evolução da doença de José Alencar | accessdate=31 March 2011 | date=29 March 2011 | publisher=[[Folha de S.

==Psychological impact==
{{See also|Miscarriage and mental illness}}
Miscarriage has an emotional effect and can also lead to psychological disorders. One discorder that can develop is primary maternal preoccupation. This is defined as a " ...'special psychiatric condition' in which the pregnant woman identifies with her baby, highlights the crisis a woman faces when the baby with whom she is preoccupied and identified dies..."&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt; Grieving manifests itself differently for each woman after miscarriage. It may often go unrecognized.&lt;ref name="loyd"/&gt; The grief that follows a miscarriage resembles, but is not the same as, the grief experienced after the loss of a family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brier|first=Norman|date=2008-03-17|title=Grief Following Miscarriage: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature|journal=Journal of Women's Health|volume=17|issue=3|pages=451–464|doi=10.1089/jwh.2007.0505|pmid=18345996|issn=1540-9996|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disbelief, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anger]], and yearning, are described as being a part of the normal grieving process.&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kinsey|first=Cara Bicking|last2=Baptiste-Roberts|first2=Kesha|last3=Zhu|first3=Junjia|last4=Kjerulff|first4=Kristen H.|date=2015-02-01|title=Effect of Previous Miscarriage on Depressive Symptoms During Subsequent Pregnancy and Postpartum in the First Baby Study|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=391–400|doi=10.1007/s10995-014-1521-0|pmid=24894728|issn=1092-7875|pmc=4256135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = beutel&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beutel|first=M.|last2=Deckardt|first2=R.|last3=von Rad|first3=M.|last4=Weiner|first4=H.|date=November 1995|title=Grief and depression after miscarriage: their separation, antecedents, and course|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=57|issue=6|pages=517–526|issn=0033-3174|pmid=8600477}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reactions remain from three to nine months after the loss. Forty-one percent of parents experience a normal, expected decline in grief in the first two years while 59% were delayed in the resolution of their grief.&lt;ref name="kirs" /&gt;

Grieving can create feelings of [[loneliness]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
This grieving has been called a type of  [[psychological trauma]].&lt;ref name="loyd"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lloyd Jones|first1=Sarah|year=2015|title=The Psychological Miscarriage: An Exploration of Women's Experience of Miscarriage in the Light of Winnicott's 'Primary Maternal Preoccupation', The Process of Grief According to Bowlby and Parkes, and Klein's Theory of Mourning|journal=British Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=31|issue=4|pages=433–447|doi=10.1111/bjp.12172|issn=0265-9883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; Other serious consequences can develop including depression, [[anxiety disorder]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], and [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatoform disorder]]. These responses all are associated with grieving after a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="ce" /&gt; Some women are able to complete the grieving process a few weeks after the miscarriage and start anticipating their next pregnancy. Planning another pregnancy is traumatic for others. The impact of a miscarriage can be "crippling" psychologically.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt; Anger can be directed toward those who have had successful  pregnancies and children.&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;  A woman can grieve the "loss of a future child" and question her own role as a mother.&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; They may blame themselves or their partner for the miscarriage.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/baby/grief-after-miscarriage#1|title=Grief After Miscarriage|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson2011dil/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

Unsuccessful attempts to become pregnant through [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) can also illicit a similar grief response in women.&lt;ref name="Robinson2011dil"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Gail Erlick|title=Dilemmas Related to Pregnancy Loss|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=199|issue=8|year=2011|pages=571–574|issn=0022-3018|doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e318225f31e|pmid=21814082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those experiencing a late miscarriage may have more significant distress compared to those who have experienced a miscarriage in the first trimester.&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheidt|first=CE|date=2007|title=Trauerverarbeitung nach Prä- und Perinatalverlust ( Mourning processing after pre-and perinatal loss)|journal=Psychother Psych Med|volume=57|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1055/s-2006-951906|pmid=17357028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even depression can occur.&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt;

"Women today...are aught in a unique historical moment: technology encourages them to form emotional attachments to their pregnancies, but society has not developed traditions to cushion the shock when those attachmets are shattered."{{sfn | Seftel | page = 62}}

Descriptions of the miscarriage are expressed in non-clinical terms by those who have experienced the event.

===Trauma===
Miscarriage has been found to be a traumatic event and a major loss for women.&lt;ref name = jeve/&gt; Pregnancy loss, including induced abortion is a risk factor for mental illness. The impact of miscarriage can be underestimated.{{sfn|Chritiansen| page=87}}&lt;ref name=buon/&gt; The trauma can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}}
The trauma of miscarriage can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}}
&lt;!--==Risks==--&gt; 
Bipolar disorders are associated with miscarriage. Depression and bilpolar disorder becomes evident after a miscarriage in 43% of women. Some women are more likely to experience complicated and prolonged grief than others.&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;

==== Mental health ====
Women experiencing miscarriage are at risk for grief reactions, anxiety or depression.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;  Obsessiveness regarding the miscarriage can develop.{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Seftel|page = 60}}  Primary maternal preoccupation is also considered a consequence of miscarriage. This condition can occur if a woman who develop a close bond "with her baby" experiences the loss of the pregnancy.&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt;{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Complicated grief===
Different grieving "styles" can exist and vary between individuals. There can be a complete avoidance of dealing with the memories of the miscarriage and there can be an "obsessive" concentration on an event in the miscarriage. This is in contrast with the expected ability to "reminisce about the loss of a loved one".{{sfn|Seftel|page = 60}} [[Prolonged grief disorder|Complicated grief]] differs from the more common form of grief that occurs after a miscarriage. The grieving process associated with other events such as the loss of a spouse or parent is expected to decline in predictable and steady rate. This not true for those experiencing grief after a miscarriage because only 41% follow the expected decline in grief while most, 59% do not fit this pattern.&lt;ref name = kirs&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kersting|first=Anette|last2=Wagner|first2=Birgit|date=June 2012|title=Complicated grief after perinatal loss|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=14|issue=2|pages=187–194|issn=1294-8322|pmc=3384447|pmid=22754291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress and posttraumatic stress disorder===
Miscarriage is associated with post traumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="buon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=daug&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daugirdaitė|first=Viltė|last2=Akker|first2=Olga van den|last3=Purewal|first3=Satvinder|date=2015|title=Posttraumatic Stress and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after Termination of Pregnancy and Reproductive Loss: A Systematic Review|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jp/2015/646345/|journal=Journal of Pregnancy|language=en|volume=2015|pages=1–14|doi=10.1155/2015/646345|pmid=25734016|pmc=4334933|issn=2090-2727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowles|first=Stephen V.|last2=James|first2=Larry C.|last3=Solursh|first3=Diane S.|last4=Yancey|first4=Michael K.|last5=Epperly|first5=Ted D.|last6=Folen|first6=Raymond A.|last7=Masone|first7=Maryann|date=2000-03-15|title=Acute and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder After Spontaneous Abortion|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0315/p1689.html|journal=American Family Physician|language=en|volume=61|issue=6|issn=0002-838X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Risks for developing PTSD after miscarriage are: emotional pain, expressions of emotion, and low levels of  social support.&lt;ref name= daug/&gt; Even if relatively low levels of stress occur after the miscarriage, symptoms of PTSD including flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, dissociation and hyperarousal can later develop.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}} The effects of stress can complicate miscarriage.&lt;ref name = jeve/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Miscarriage is a stressful event and because stress is a risk factor for subsequent miscarriage, its presence can become part of cycle that continues.&lt;ref name="jeve" /&gt; Lower stress levels are associated with more favorable outcomes in future pregnancies while higher stress levels increase the risk.{{sfn|Christiansen|page = 92}}

==Recovery==
Physical recovery from miscarriage can have an effect on emotional disturbances. The body has to recover from the sudden pregnancy loss. In some instances f[[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] is present. [[Insomnia]] can be a problem.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aafp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The miscarriage is very upsetting to the family and can generate very strong emotions. Some women may feel that the miscarriage occurred because they somehow had caused it.

&lt;!--Interventions==--&gt;Counseling can be offered but effective interventions to assist in recovery have been difficult to identify due to the reports of efficacy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neugebauer|first=Richard|last2=Kline|first2=Jennie|last3=Bleiberg|first3=Kathryn|last4=Baxi|first4=Laxmi|last5=Markowitz|first5=John C.|last6=Rosing|first6=Mark|last7=Levin|first7=Bruce|last8=Keith|first8=Jessica|date=2007|title=Preliminary open trial of interpersonal counseling for subsyndromal depression following miscarriage|journal=Depression and Anxiety|volume=24|issue=3|pages=219–222|doi=10.1002/da.20150|issn=1091-4269|pmid=16988939}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ineffective counseling. Comparisons are hard to make.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ce" /&gt; Despite the lack of studies that describe effective interventions for those with grief after a miscarriage, some clinicians still offer counselling and follow-up to help women recover and adapt to the loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Rachel|date=Jun 20–26, 2012|title=Emotional care for women who experience miscarriage|journal=Nursing Standard (Royal College of Nursing (Great Britain): 1987)|volume=26|issue=42|pages=35–41|doi=10.7748/ns2012.06.26.42.35.c9160|issn=0029-6570|pmid=22908762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommendations to help recover from the event include:
* Turning to loved ones and friends for support. Sharing feelings and asking for help when needed.
* Talking to the partner about the miscarriage. 
* Keeping in mind that men and women cope with loss in different ways.&lt;ref name="whealth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Making good choices for health and well-being such as: eating healthy foods, keeping active, and getting enough sleep to help restore energy.
* Joining a support group. A support group might help with feelings of being alone in the loss.&lt;ref name="whealth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Doing something in remembrance of the baby.
* Seeking help from a grief counselor, especially if the grief doesn't ease with time.&lt;ref name = whealth/&gt;

Generally, the impact of experiencing miscarriage is underestimated.&lt;ref name="buon"/&gt;{{sfn|Chritiansen| page=87}} Other methods used to promote recovery are be relaxation techniques, guided imagery, and "thought-stopping". Even Gestalt role-playing has been used. Some women can "emotionally relocate the child", redefine a relationship "with the missing child", and engage in "continuing the bond" to incorporate the loss into their life experiences.{{sfn | Seftel | page = 60}}

Women who have miscarried report that they were dissatisfied with the care they received from physicians and nurses.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014provision/&gt; One observer highlights the insensitivity of some health care providers when they approach the grieving mother "...by playing down her emotion as somehow an irrational response..."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=Dorte M.|title=Posttraumatic stress disorder in parents following infant death: A systematic review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272735816300903|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|language=en|volume=51|pages=60–74|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2016.10.007|pmid=27838460|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Clinicians may not recognize the psychological impact of the miscarriage and can "expect parents to move on with their lives."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Since the experiences of women can vary so widely, sensitive nursing care afterward is appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radford|first=Eleanor J|last2=Hughes|first2=Mark|date=2015-06-01|title=Women's experiences of early miscarriage: implications for nursing care|journal=Journal of Clinical Nursing|volume=24|issue=11–12|pages=1457–1465|doi=10.1111/jocn.12781|pmid=25662397|issn=1365-2702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children and concerns about future pregnancies==
One emotional response to miscarriage is the strong apprehension that can develop anticipating a subsequent pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name = sing&gt;{{cite journal | publisher = Singapore Nursing Journal | title = The impact miscarriage on women's psychological well being and interventions: A literature review | first = Marianne | last = Wen-Yi | first2 = Lam | last2 = Ka Shun | first3 = Priscilla Jia | last3 = Ling Ho et.al }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = aafp/&gt; Procreation abilities may also be questioned by the woman.&lt;ref name = sing/&gt;&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; Significant distress can develop in the other children in the family when they think a sibling has died. They may regard this as a baby they did not get to meet. They can also experience grief and guilt find it difficult to express these emotions to their parents. The siblings may feel a need to act as if everything is the same and that they are unaffected in an attempt to protect their parents from their own feelings. Children can also need help, understanding and the ability to make sense of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Becoming Parents and Overcoming Obstacles : Understanding the Experience of Miscarriage, Premature Births, Infertility, and Postnatal Depression|last=Quagliata|first=Emanuela|publisher=Karnac Books|year=2013|isbn=9781782200185|location=City|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials and burial==
[[Ritual]]s that recognize the loss can be important in coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's reproductive mental health across the lifespan|others=Lynn-Barnes, Diana|isbn=9783319051154|location=Cham|oclc=880941778}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Family and friends often conduct a memorial or burial service.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name=uk/&gt; Hospitals also can provide support and help memorialize the event. Depending on locale others desire to have a private ceremony.&lt;ref name=uk/&gt; The religious faith of the woman and family impacts the grief process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cowchock|first=F.

&lt;!--==Narratives==
Women discuss their miscarriage and interact with others who have had the same experience. This is one way that their loss is recognized, publically mourned and socially accepted.{{sfn | Seftel | page = 57}}--&gt;

==In culture==
Grieving after the loss of a child through miscarriage in other cultures can vary from western culture.&lt;ref name="Klass2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klass|first1=Dennis|title=Book Reviews of Narratives of Sorrow and Dignity: Japanese Women, Pregnancy Loss, and Modern Rituals of Grieving|journal=OMEGA - Journal of Death and Dying|volume=70|issue=4|year=2015|pages=454–457|issn=0030-2228|doi=10.1177/0030222815573931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hospicefoundation.org/Grief-(1)/What-to-Expect | title=Hospice Foundation of America - What is Grief?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An individual’s [[culture]] plays a large role in determining an inappropriate pattern of grief, and it is appropriate to take into account cultural norms before reaching a complicated grief diagnosis.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shear|first1=MK|last2=Simon|first2=N|last3=Wall|first3=M|last4=Zisook|first4=S|last5=Neimeyer|first5=R|last6=Duan|first6=N|last7=Reynolds|first7=C|last8=Lebowitz|first8=B|last9=Sung|first9=S|last10=Ghesquiere|first10=A|last11=Gorscak|first11=B|last12=Clayton|first12=P|last13=Ito|first13=M|last14=Nakajima|first14=S|last15=Konishi|first15=T|last16=Melhem|first16=N|last17=Meert|first17=K|last18=Schiff|first18=M|last19=O'Connor|first19=MF|last20=First|first20=M|last21=Sareen|first21=J|last22=Bolton|first22=J|last23=Skritskaya|first23=N|last24=Mancini|first24=AD|last25=Keshaviah|first25=A|title=Complicated grief and related bereavement issues for DSM-5.|journal=Depression and Anxiety|date=February 2011|volume=28|issue=2|pages=103–17|doi=10.1002/da.20780|pmid=21284063|pmc=3075805}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cultural differences in emotional levels, how these are expressed and how long they are expressed. External symptoms of grief differ in non-Western cultures, presenting increased [[somatization]].&lt;ref name="seventythree"&gt;Horwitz, A. V., &amp; Wakefield, J. C. (2007).

Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Narratives by Swedish women include their own perception of losing a child. Investigations describe their grief over their miscarriage: "When miscarriage occurs it is not a gore, an embryo, or a fetus they lose, it is their child. They feel that they are the cause of the miscarriage through something they have done, eaten, or thought. They feel [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment]] and they grieve for their profound loss; they are actually in bereavement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adolfsson|first=Annsofie|last2=Larsson|first2=P.

'''Order processing''' is the process or work-flow associated with the picking, packing and delivery of the packed items to a shipping carrier. Order processing is a key element of [[order fulfillment]].  Order processing operations or facilities are commonly called "[[distribution center]]s".

==Process==

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-22350-0001, Berlin, Postamt O 17, Päckchenverteilung.jpg|thumb|right|Sorting packages according to destination]]

Order processing is a sequential process involving:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;D.F. Bozutti, M.A. Bueno-Da-Costa, R. Ruggeri, Logística: Visão Global e Picking, EdUFSCar 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[#Picking|Picking]]: consists in taking and collecting articles in a specified quantity before shipment to satisfy customers' orders. 
*[[#Sorting|Sorting]]: process that separates items according to destination. 
*Pre-consolidation or package formation  : includes weighting, [[Packaging and labeling|labeling]] and [[Packaging and labeling|packing]].

==Picking==
[[Image:Sistema de preparación de pedidos pick to light.jpg|thumb|Person to goods picking assisted by conveyor belt]]

The '''order picking''' or order preparation operation is one of a logistic warehouse's processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inventoryops.com/order_picking.htm|title= Order Picking:  Methods and Equipment for Piece Pick, Case Pick, and Pallet Pick Operations|last=Piasecki|first=Dave|publisher=InventoryOps.com|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It consists in taking and collecting articles in a specified quantity before shipment to satisfy customers' orders.
It is a basic warehousing process and has an important influence on [[supply chain]]'s productivity. This makes order picking one of the most controlled logistic processes.

It is one of the [[warehouse management system]] functions.

===Types===
Types of order picking include:
* '''[[#Piece Picking|piece picking]] or picker to part method''': the order picker(s) move(s) to collect the products necessary for one order. This is commonly seen in distribution centres for retail chains whereby a shop will require a great many replenishment goods. A picker may pick all or part of the replenishment for one shop.
* '''zone picking method''': each order picker is assigned to one specific zone and will only realize order picking within this zone. For instance, in an electrical retail environment, both small and large items may be required and a picker on an electric vehicle such as a powered pallet truck (PPT) or an order picker vehicle may pick large and heavy items whereas a foot picker may pick small and light ones from another part of the warehouse. Eventually the two picks are collated.
* '''wave picking method''': ([[Wave picking]]) the order picker(s) move(s) to collect the products necessary for several orders
* '''sorting systems method''': no movement of the order picker(s), the products are brought to him by an automatic system ([[conveyor system]], automatic storage ...).
* '''pick to box method''':{{huh|date=November 2016}} The WMS direct the operator to pick the sku from a storage bin or a transportation box and to put it inside the shipping box or into a box assigned to the sales order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wms.com.es/picking-carritos-de-recogida.html|title=Pick to box procedures|last=|first=|date=|website=wms.com.es|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technologies===
There are various ways in which a pick may be communicated to a picker:
* a simple paper pick list,
* an [[RFID]] terminal
* a list of labels that list an item's location -one per item being picked
* [[Voice Directed Warehousing|voice picking equipment]]
* pick to light equipment
* [[Automated storage and retrieval system|automated storage and retrieval systems (ASRS)]]. There are many types, but the basics are mini-load, mid-load and unit load. Each system is used to deliver totes, cases, cartons, pallets or inventory with unique physical profiles. Mini-Loads usually range up to 1000&amp;nbsp;lbs per load; Mid-Load up to 2000&amp;nbsp;lbs per load; Unit Load for pallets up to 5000&amp;nbsp;lbs per load.
* An automated dispenser, in which products are pilled up and separated from each other, and then automatically released on a conveyor belt when required (obviously not applicable to all types of merchandise)
* [[Augmented reality]]

Some of these technologies can also be used to make sure the picker picked from the proper location using [[barcode]] or [[RFID]] terminal or voice picking.

===Piece Picking===
Piece picking, also known as broken case picking or pick/pack operations, describes systems where individual items are picked. Operations using piece picking typically have a large [[stock keeping unit]], or SKU, base in the thousands or tens of thousands of items, small quantities per pick, and short cycle times. Examples of piece pick operations include mail order catalog companies and repair parts distributors. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inventoryops.com/order_picking.htm | last=Piasecki | first=Dave | title=Order Picking: Methods and Equipment for Piece Pick, Case Pick, and Pallet Pick Operations | publisher= Inventory Ops Consultation | year=2012 | accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case Picking===
Operations that use case picking tend to have less diversity in product characteristics than operations that use piece picking. There are typically fewer SKUs and higher picks per SKU. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Pallet Picking===
Full-pallet picking, or unit-load picking, uses much simpler systematic methods than piece picking or case picking. However, there are many choices in storage equipment, storage configurations and types of lift trucks. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Sorting ==
'''Sorting machines in distribution'''
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}

==Pick and pack==
'''Pick and pack''' is a part of a complete [[supply chain management]] process that is commonly used in the retail distribution of goods. It entails processing small to large quantities of product, often truck or train loads and disassembling them, picking the relevant product for each destination and re-[[packaging]] with shipping [[label]] affixed and invoice included. Usual service includes obtaining a fair rate of shipping from common as well as expediting truck carriers.
Pick and Pack services are offered by many businesses that specialize in supply chain management solutions.
'''Case picking''' is the gathering of full cartons or boxes of product. This is often done on a [[pallet]]. In the consumer products industry, case picking large quantities of cartons is often an entry level employee's task. There is, however, significant skill required to make a good pallet load of product. Key requirements are that cartons not be damaged, they make good use of the available cube (space) and be quick to assemble.

[[Warehouse management system]] products create pick paths to minimize the travel distance of an order selector, but often neglect the need to maximize the use of cube, segregate products that should not touch or minimize damage.

==Factors==
The specific "order fulfillment process" or the operational procedures of distribution centers are determined by many factors.  Each distribution center has its own unique requirements or priorities.  There is no "one size fits all" process that universally provides the most efficient operation.  Some of the factors that determine the specific process flow of a distribution center are:
* The nature of the shipped product - shipping eggs and shipping shirts can require differing fulfillment processes
* The nature of the orders - the number of differing items and quantities of each item in orders
* The nature of the shipping packaging - cases, totes, envelopes, pallets can create process variations
* Shipping costs - consolidation of orders, shipping pre-sort can change processing operations
* Availability and cost and [[productivity]] of workforce - can create trade-off decisions in automation and manual processing operations
* [[Timeliness]] of shipment windows - when shipments need to be completed based on carriers can create processing variations
* Availability of capital expenditure dollars - influence on manual verses automated process decisions and longer term benefits
* Value of product shipped - the ratio of the value of the shipped product and the order fulfillment cost
* [[Seasonality]] variations in outbound volume - amount and duration of seasonal peaks and valleys of outbound volume
* Predictability of future volume, product and order profiles
* Predictability of distribution network - whether or not the network itself is going to change
* Presence of small volume distribution
* Minimization of shipping costs

This list is only a small sample of factors that can influence the choice of a distribution centers operational procedures.  Because each factor has varying importance in each organization the net effect is that each organization has unique processing requirements.

The effect of [[Globalization]] has immense impacts on much of the order fulfillment but its impact is felt mostly in transportation and distribution.

The '''Penguin Group''' is a trade book publisher and part of [[Penguin Random House]]. It is owned by [[Pearson PLC]], the global education and publishing company, and [[Bertelsmann]], the German media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]. The new company was created by a [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] that was finalised on 1 July 2013, with Bertelsmann owning 53% of the joint venture, and Pearson controlling the remaining 47%.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sweney [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/29/penguin-random-house-book-publisher "Penguin and Random House merger to create biggest book publisher ever seen"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 29 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Penguin Books]] has its registered office in [[City of Westminster]], London.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/aboutus/index.html#question1 26. What is Penguin Books Limited's company registration number?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711051613/http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/aboutus/index.html |date=11 July 2009 }}" Penguin Books.

[[City of Westminster]]. Retrieved 28 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its British division is ''[[Penguin Books]] Ltd.'' Other separate divisions can be found in the United States, Ireland, New Zealand, India, Australia, Canada, China, Brazil and South Africa.

==History==
[[Penguin Books]] Ltd. (est. 1935) of the United Kingdom was bought over by [[Longman|Pearson Longman]] in 1970. In 1975, Penguin acquired the American hardcover firm [[Viking Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/11/archives/viking-press-is-sold-to-penguin-books.html|title=Viking Press Is Sold to Penguin Books|last=Whitman|first=Alden|date=1975-11-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Penguin acquired the [[New American Library]], a mass-market paperback publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = McDowell| first = Edwin| title = PENGUIN AGREES TO BUY NEW AMERICAN LIBRARY| accessdate = 2018-12-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/01/garden/penguin-agrees-to-buy-new-american-library.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penguin Group (USA) Inc. was formed in 1996 as a result of the merger between Penguin Books USA and the [[G. P. Putnam's Sons|Putnam Berkley Group]] after Penguin acquired Putnam Berkley from [[MCA Inc.|MCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Lyall| first = Sarah| title = Penguin Is Buying MCA's Putnam Berkley for $336 Million| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-12-02| date = 1996-11-27| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/27/business/penguin-is-buying-mca-s-putnam-berkley-for-336-million.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/media/features/5618/index1.html|title=Now for the Grann Finale|website=NYMag.com|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly formed company was originally called Penguin Putnam Inc., but, in 2003, it changed its name to Penguin Group (USA) Inc. to reflect the parent Pearson PLC's grouping of all the Penguin companies worldwide under the supervisory umbrella of Pearson's own Penguin Group division.

The different Penguin companies use many [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s, many of which used to be independent publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/aboutus/index.html|title=Penguin Group (USA): About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penguin Group (USA) Inc. also operates its own [[speaker's bureau]] that books speaking engagements for many of the publisher's authors. In 2011, the online writing and publishing community [[Book Country]] was launched as a subsidiary of Penguin Group USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookcountry.com/AboutUs/Penguin.aspx |title=What's the Penguin About? |publisher=Bookcountry.com |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the [[United States Department of Justice]] filed ''[[United States v. Apple Inc.]]'', naming [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], Penguin, and four other major publishers as defendants.  The suit alleged that they conspired to [[price-fixing|fix prices]] for [[e-books]] and weaken [[Amazon.com]]'s position in the market in violation of [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]].&lt;ref name="washington post DOJ sues"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/justice-department-files-suit-against-apple-publishers-report-says/2012/04/11/gIQAzyXSAT_story.html | title=Justice Department sues Apple, publishers over e-book prices | work=The Washington Post | date=11 April 2012 | accessdate=1 June 2014 | author=Mui, Ylan Q. and Hayley Tsukayama}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, a federal judge approved a settlement of the antitrust claims, in which Penguin and the other publishers paid into a fund that provided credits to customers who had overpaid for books due to the price-fixing.&lt;ref name="usatoday settlements rolling out"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/03/25/amazon-settlements-ebooks/6869033/ | title=E-book price fixing settlements rolling out | work=USA Today | date=25 March 2014 | accessdate=1 June 2014 | author=Molina, Brett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Pearson entered into talks with rival conglomerate [[Bertelsmann]], over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Penguin Group and [[Random House]]. The houses were considered two of the Big-Six publishing companies, prior to the merger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edgecliffe |first=Andrew |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/eaf8eaaa-1eac-11e2-be82-00144feabdc0.html |title=Penguin and Random House in deal talks |work=Financial Times |date=26 October 2012 |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became the Big-Five publishing houses upon completion of the combination. The [[European Union]] approved of the [[Penguin Random House]] merger on 5 April 2013; Pearson controls 47% of the publisher.

A '''ringtest''' is part of an external [[quality assurance]] programme for a measuring method. Usually a reference institute sends identical samples which have to be analysed for special parameters to different laboratories. The industrial, medical or research [[laboratory]] gets a limited time with a deadline to send in the analysis results. The statistical evaluation and interpretation of the laboratories’ results is a great help for all participating labs as it opens the possibility to assess the quality of their analysis compared to other laboratories. For accredited laboratories (e.g. ISO 17025 etc.) the participation in ringtests is obligatory. Nevertheless, also non accredited labs take part in ringtests.

==Fields of application==
* tests of medical parameters ([[blood]], [[urine]], [[biological tissue|tissue]] etc.)
* food analysis
* material analysis
* [[paternity (law)|paternity]] testing (autosomal DNA markers, Y and X chromosomal markers, mtDNA sequencing)

==Life==
The son of Jamaican immigrants, Eaton grew up in [[Harlem]].&lt;ref name=bhm&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards |first1=Geoff |title=Black History Month: an interview with Roy Eaton |url=http://creativity-online.com/news/black-history-month-an-interview-with-roy-eaton/148896 |accessdate=3 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422153034/http://creativity-online.com/news/black-history-month-an-interview-with-roy-eaton/148896 |archivedate=April 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a mechanic and his mother a domestic servant.&lt;ref name=am/&gt;
He took up classical piano when he was six&lt;ref name=am/&gt; and shortly after, in 1937, played at [[Carnegie Hall]], winning gold medal in a [[Music Education League]] competition.&lt;ref name=ofc&gt;{{cite web|title=Roy Eaton|url=http://www.oldfirstconcerts.org/artists/426/|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Selecta''' is a [[dairy products]] brand owned by [[Philippines]]-based [[RFM Corporation]] ({{Pse|RFM}}). Its [[milk]] business is operated by RFM Corporation, while its [[ice cream]] business is operated under a joint-venture with [[Unilever Philippines|Unilever Philippines, Inc.]] (known as Unilever RFM Ice Cream, Inc.).

==History==

The brand's beginnings can be traced back to 1933&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Arce Sons &amp; Company v. Selecta Biscuit Company, Inc. et al |vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court=Supreme Court of the Philippines |date=January 28, 1961 |url= http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1961/jan1961/gr_l-14761_1961.html |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Ramon Arce started [[Pasteurization|pasteurizing]] [[carabao]] [[milk]] near his home in Novaliches (then a part of [[Caloocan City]]), where carabaos were in abundance (Unilever RFM Ice Cream, Inc. would cite the brand’s foundation year as 1948.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unilever.com.ph/our-brands/detail/Selecta/334702/&lt;/ref&gt;). Arce began selling and distributing fresh milk in bottles using the Selecta brand name to residences, restaurants and offices. Soon after, Arce and his wife, Carmen, would come up with their own ice cream recipe made from carabao milk. These products became the foundation of the family’s Selecta business, which later included the Selecta restaurants and bakery. The Selecta business was continued by Arce’s children after his retirement in 1950. By the 1970s, Selecta’s carabao milk based ice cream and fresh milk became available in supermarkets. Its milk was packaged in glass bottles while its ice cream was packaged in gold colored tin containers.

In January 1990, [[RFM Corporation]] acquired the Selecta brand from Arcecon Dairy Products, Inc. (successor-in-interest to the Selecta business) and established Selecta Dairy Products, Inc. to take over the production of Selecta ice cream. Under RFM ownership, the recipe of Selecta ice cream was improved and aggressively marketed, posing a serious challenge to then market leader, [[Magnolia ice cream|Magnolia]]. With its success, its ice cream recipe would eventually shift to cow’s milk. Much later, the gold colored tin containers would be changed to gold colored plastic tubs. RFM also introduced its own Selecta milk products which were made from cow’s milk.

In January 1995, the family of Mauro Arce, the youngest son of Ramon and Carmen Arce, revived the Arce family’s original ice cream business under a new name, '''Arce Dairy'''. Its ice cream would continue to be made from carabao milk and packaged in gold colored tin containers, reminiscent of the original (Arce era) Selecta.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/04/16/12/arce-family-serving-‘all-natural’-ice-cream-pinoys-1935&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, RFM entered into a joint-venture with [[Unilever (Philippines)|Unilever Philippines, Inc.]] to take over the production and marketing of the Selecta ice cream business.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dairynetwork.com/doc/unilever-enters-ice-cream-venture-in-philippi-0001&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose, Selecta Walls, Inc. was established (now known as Unilever RFM Ice Cream, Inc.). The Selecta milk business continues to be operated directly by RFM Corporation.

==Life==
Seng was born in [[Fengshun]], [[Meizhou]], [[Guangdong]] to Chao Saekhu.&lt;ref name="ASTV"/&gt; Seng came to [[Thailand|Siam]] in the 1860s together with his parents and second brother. However, as Seng's mother and second brother soon fell ill shortly arriving in Siam, his parents and brother returned to China, leaving Seng in the care of a local acquaintance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2006-11-20/163010550437s.shtml 他信祖籍地：丰顺县塔下村] 2006年11月20日16:30 金羊网-羊城晚报, retrieved 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Seng spent his early years in Chanthaburi where he met his wife, a native Thai by the name of Thongdi. Their eldest son, Chiang was born in 1890 around this time and Seng started his career as a tax farmer in this small town.&lt;ref&gt;Baker et al (2009), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; When the land lease expired in 1900, Seng and his family moved to [[Talat Noi]] in Bangkok around 1900 where worked as a commercial trader. Seng and his family relocated to [[Chiang Mai]] around 1908 to resume his career as a tax farmer under the patronage of Nikhon Jinkit.&lt;ref&gt;Baker et al (2009), p. 27-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Seng married two wives; the first to Thongdi with whom he had 6 children, including Chiang. Thongdi died of a heart attack in 1910 due to a robbery incident, and Seng remarried another lady, Nocha with whom he had 3 children. Chiang married another Thai lady, Saeng Samana with whom they have 12 children.&lt;ref&gt;Baker et al (2009), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang's second child and oldest son, Sak Shinawatra, adopted the Shinawatra surname in 1938, during [[Plaek Pibulsonggram]]'s anti-Chinese campaigns, and the rest of the clan followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;Baker et al (2009), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Sak Shinawatra became an army general and has four sons who all served in the army for at least sometime. Sak's third son, [[Chaiyasit Shinawatra]] became the commander-in-chief of the [[Royal Thai Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Baker et al (2009), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiang's 4th child and second son, Loet Shinawatra is the father of [[Prime Ministers of Thailand|Prime Ministers]] [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] and [[Yingluck Shinawatra]]. Loet served as an MP for Chiang Mai in 1969 and 1976 for the [[Thai Nation Party]]. Loet married Yindi Ramingwong, who is the daughter of a Hakka Chinese immigrant and his wife, a princess of the Lanna royalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.people.com.cn/200507/03/eng20050703_193730.html |title=Thai PM concludes China tour |newspaper=People's Daily Online; Xinhua |date=July 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsm.com.cn/news/2005/0701/68/596.shtml |script-title=zh:泰国总理他信：我是华裔客家人 |trans-title=Thai Prime Minister: 'I am Hakka Chinese' |date=July 1, 2005 |work=Overseas Chinese Network |publisher=中国侨网|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In August 2006, a Social Enterprise Committee chaired by Mr [[Philip Yeo]] was formed to explore growth opportunities within the local social enterprise sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/315250/1/.html "Panel suggests more funding for social enterprises"]&lt;/ref&gt; The 26 recommendations provided by the Committee included setting up a Social Enterprise Association and a Social Enterprise Development Centre to cultivate a thriving culture of [[social entrepreneurship]] and related enterprises. The Social Enterprise Implementation Committee chaired by [[Gerard Ee]] then carried out the relevant operational procedures to materialize the recommendations listed previously. In June 2009, the Association was officially registered as a [[Company Limited by Guarantee]]. Currently, SE Association is co-chaired by Mr Seah Kian Peng, CEO (Singapore) of [[NTUC Fairprice Co-operative]] Ltd, and Ms Penny Low, President and Founder of Social Innovation Park Ltd. The other two board members are Mr Alfie Othman, director of Ikhlas Holdings Pte Ltd, and Dr Gillian Koh, senior research fellow of the Institute of Policy Studies at [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]] in the National University of Singapore.

==Community and membership==
The SE Association's primary objective is to bring about positive social impact and an inclusive community among Singaporeans. It aims, first and foremost, to address the needs and interests of its target community – social enterprises, social entrepreneurs and would-be social innovators (see [[social innovation]]) – and then further engage other potential partners from the private sector and government to work on synergistic partnerships to promote the strength of its members and the sector as a whole. SE Association's members are social enterprises, individuals, students, voluntary welfare organisations / non-profit organisations, and corporate. Seminars, talks, [[focus groups]], consultations and networking sessions have been organized by the Association to provide learning opportunities for both members and the public. Their members are mostly located in the social enterprises in Singapore.

==Social Enterprise Development Centre (SEDC)==
The SEDC belongs to the training and consultancy arm of SE Association. The SEDC was launched&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1088784/1/.html "Social Enterprise Development Center Launched"]&lt;/ref&gt; in October 2010 to build up the institutional capacity of social enterprises by working alongside social entrepreneurs to nurture and develop their social enterprises from infancy to maturity, and thereafter integrate them with the mainstream business communities.

SEDC offers two main advisory services: SE Start-up Advisory, and SE Business Advisory which includes advice and coaching. Advisory services offered without implementation plans is free- of- charge, but a fee is charged if SEDC is required to facilitate the development and execution of plans or where third party expertise is required. In addition, SEDC offers training and capability-building programmes for [[social enterprise]]s.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;\text{Target Income Sales (in Units)} &amp; &amp;= \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}+\text{Target Income}}{\text{Unit Contribution}}\\

&lt;!-- FAIR USE of LoyaltyEffectRevCover.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:LoyaltyEffectRevCover.jpg for rationale --&gt;
'''''The Loyalty Effect''''' is a 1996 [[book]] by [[Fred Reichheld]] of the consulting firm [[Bain &amp; Company]], and the book's title is also sometimes used to refer to the broader [[loyalty business model]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt; {{doi|10.1016/S0377-2217(02)00392-2}} Gunnarsson, Claes and Seth Jonsson, European Journal of Operational Research, Volume 144, Issue 2, 16 January 2003, Pages 257-269&lt;/ref&gt; Reichheld's book was exceptionally popular with [[marketing]] and [[customer relationship management]] professionals, and as such the phrase "loyalty effect" has become synonymous in some circles with the more generic concepts covered by the loyalty business model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://directmag.com/mag/marketing_measuring_loyalty_effect/] Hughes, Arthur Middleton, "Measuring the Loyalty Effect," Direct Magazine, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Reichheld penned a sequel to the book called ''Loyalty Rules!'' and released a revised edition of the original work.

VLJs are considered the lightest [[business jet]]s and are approved for single-pilot operation.

==History==
There were early attempts to create small jet aircraft in this class in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the [[CMC Leopard]].

After a flurry of interest in the [[Small Aircraft Transportation System|Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS)]] and [[air taxi]] markets in the early 2000s, the VLJ sector underwent significant expansion. Several new designs were produced, such as the [[Embraer Phenom 100]], the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]], and the [[Eclipse 500]]. However, following the [[Great Recession|late 2000s recession]] the air taxi market underperformed expectations, and both [[Eclipse Aviation]] and air taxi firm [[DayJet]] collapsed. In December 2010, AvWeb's Paul Bertorelli explained that the term ''very light jet'' has lost favor in the aviation industry. "Personal jet is the description du jour. You don't hear the term VLJ—very light jet—much anymore and some people in the industry tell me they think it's because that term was too tightly coupled to Eclipse, a failure that the remaining players want to, understandably, distance themselves from."&lt;ref name="AvWeb10Dec10" /&gt;

Single-engine designs were popular in the mid-2000s, before the [[global financial crisis]] diminished the market appeal of the category. Most of those programs, which included the [[Piper Altaire]], [[Diamond D-Jet]], [[Eclipse 400]] and [[VisionAire Vantage]], were all shelved and the only maintained aircraft are the [[Cirrus Vision SF50]], which is now [[type certification|type certified]] and in production, and the [[Stratos 714]], which expects certification in 2019. They are expected to compete with single [[turboprop]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-getting-personal-with-single-engined-jets-427139/ |title= Getting personal with single-engined jets |work= Flight Global |date= 21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two VLJs in history have won the [[Collier Trophy]], known as the most prestigious aerospace engineering award in the United States — the Eclipse 500 (in 2006) and the Cirrus Vision Jet (in 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://naa.aero/awards/awards-and-trophies/collier-trophy |title= Collier Trophy |work= National Aeronautic Association |accessdate= 11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Target market==
VLJs are intended to have lower operating costs than conventional jets, and to be able to operate from runways as short as {{convert|3000|ft|m}}, either for personal use or in point-to-point [[air taxi]] service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=[[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] | work=Aerospace America | url=http://www.aiaa.org/aerospace/images/articleimages/pdf/AA_May06_CRO.pdf | first=John | last=Croft | title=Very Light Jets: Boom or Blip | date=May 2006 | accessdate=2007-02-27|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Richard | last=Aboulafia | url=http://www.richardaboulafia.com/shownote.asp?id=211 | title=March 2006 Newsletter | date=2006-03-13 | accessdate=2007-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], the [[Small Aircraft Transportation System]] is aimed at providing air service to areas ignored by [[airline]]s.

[[Florida]]-based air taxi provider [[DayJet]], which on October 3, 2007 began its Eclipse 500 service, planned to operate more than 1,000 of the VLJs within five years,&lt;ref name=hgj20071102/&gt; and had stated in mid-2007 that it planned to operate 300 Eclipse 500s serving 40 regional airports in the [[Southeastern United States]] by the end of 2008.&lt;ref name=pm200706/&gt;  DayJet ceased operations on September 19, 2008.&lt;ref name=hgj20071102&gt;{{cite news | title=Very Light Jets Enter Fractional Market | publisher=[[Halogen Guides Jets]] | date=2007-11-02 | accessdate=2007-11-13 | url=http://jets.halogenguides.com/articles/885-very-light-jets-enter-fractional-markets }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When these smaller jets were first mooted, there was much interest in the fact that they would not have a [[Toilet#Lavatory|lavatory]] on board, with articles discussing the matter in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name="NYT Big Battle"&gt;{{cite news | last=Sharkey | first=Joe | title=Big Battle in Small-Jet Skies | publisher=The New York Times | date=2006-08-29 | accessdate=2006-12-12 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/29/business/29jets.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and items on [[NBC Nightly News]].&lt;ref name="CharterX"&gt;{{cite news|last=Di Piazza |first=Karen |title=No Throne Room on Eclipse VLJ: Real Issue or Media Hype? |publisher=CharterX |url=http://www.charterx.com/resources/article.aspx?id=2314 |accessdate=2006-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929084205/http://www.charterx.com/resources/article.aspx?id=2314 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some manufacturers argued that for short flights of {{convert|300|to|500|mi|km}} and 40 to 80 minutes' duration the lavatory issue was not a problem&lt;ref name="NYT Big Battle"/&gt; and air taxi service companies said that it was not a concern for most of their passengers.&lt;ref name="CharterX" /&gt; Despite this, the Eclipse 500 had the option of an electric flush, remove-to-service lavatory with a privacy curtain - at the expense of one passenger seat, and the proposed [[Adam A700]] design had a seven-seat configuration with rear lavatory with a privacy curtain. The [[Cessna Mustang]] also has an emergency toilet, but it is located between the cockpit and cabin.  The [[Embraer Phenom 100]] offers a fully enclosed lavatory with a solid door. The 2015 [[Honda HA-420 HondaJet]] has a full lavatory at the rear of the aircraft with flushing toilet, full sink and closing door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flightrun.com/hondajet/lavatory-toilet |title=HondaJet Lavatory - Toilet |accessdate=April 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vid Morpurgo''' (1838&amp;ndash;1911) was a [[Croatia]]n industrialist, publisher, politician and member of a notable [[Split, Croatia|Split]] family Morpurgo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=K.|first=M.|coauthors=|title=Split - proslava 150. obljetnice knjižare 'Morpurgo'|pages=|publisher=www.culturenet.hr|date=2010-11-23|url=http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?id=34323|accessdate=2013-06-24|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and family==
Morpurgo was born on 7 May 1838 in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], Croatia to a well-known [[Jews in Croatia|Jewish]] family of David-Elija and Anetta ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Gentili) Morpurgo. His great-great-grandfather David-Vita moved to Split in 1774 from [[Maribor]] ([[German language|Ger.]]: Marburg), [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=Vid Morpurgo|pages=|publisher=|date=|url=http://www.juditapalace.com/hr-hr/zanimljivosti/vid-morpurgo.aspx|accessdate=2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chose his surname ''Morpurgo'' from the Italian version of the German ''Marburger'' (i.e. someone from Marburg). From 1846 to 1849 Morpurgo attended and finished elementary school in Split. Later he attended the Royal grammar school in Split from which he graduated in 1856.&lt;ref name="vmhnp"&gt;{{harvtxt|Duško Kečkemet|1963|pp=10, 21, 58, 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Tonkin|first=Boyd|coauthors=|title=Boyd Tonkin: The magnificent Morpurgos|pages=|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=2010-08-20|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/boyd-tonkin-the-magnificent-morpurgos-2056968.html|accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kuzmanić|first=Nepo|coauthors=|title=Obitelj Morpurgo, Židovi iz Marburga|pages=|publisher=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|date=|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20020517/feljton02.asp|accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and business career==
[[File:Annuario Dalmatico.jpg|thumb|left|130px|"Annuario Dalmatico" (Dalmatian Yearly) from 1859. published by Morpurgo.]]
After completing his education, Morpurgo was employed at the library which was co-owned by his father and his business partner Petar Savo. There Morpurgo developed bookseller activity enabling him partnership with numerous foreign publishing houses. In 1855 he traveled to [[Trieste]], [[Italy]] to sign contracts with booksellers and publishers. In 1860 Morpurgo founded his own bookstore "Libreria Morpurgo succ. Savo" by buying out Savo's shares. In 1861 he started the first [[interlibrary loan]] in Split. In 1862 bookstore was renamed to "Libreria Morpurgo". In 1859 Morpurgo published the ''Annuario Dalmatico'' (''Dalmatian Yearly'') and in 1861 he published the second volume which in contrast to the first volume discussed the political problems in the country. During 1861 out of ten political publications released in Split, five were published by Morpurgo. During that time he also published the variety of commemorative books and brochures.&lt;ref name="vmhnp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vl"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pejković-Kačanski|first=Maja|coauthors=|title=Mala knjižara Vida Morpurga iz Splita slavi veliki, 150. rođendan|pages=|publisher=[[Večernji list]]|date=2010-11-19|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/kultura/mala-knjizara-vida-morpurga-splita-slavi-veliki-150-rodendan-clanak-217836|accessdate=2013-06-24|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pjvm"&gt;{{Cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=Vid Morpurgo|pages=|publisher=Palača Judita|date=|url=http://www.juditapalace.com/hr-hr/zanimljivosti/vid-morpurgo.aspx|accessdate=2013-06-24|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morpurgo's bookstore, from the very beginning of its activity, was the headquarters of the [[People's Party (Dalmatia)|People's Party]], where young intellectuals, inspired by the ideas of the ''Hrvatski narodni preporod'' (''Croatian national revival''), held their meetings. Morpurgo was an informal organizer and adviser of the People's Party. Morpurgo was involved in starting the independent Croatian weekly newspaper ''[[Narodni list]]'' (''People's paper''). He took upon himself the administration and management of the newspaper, and also wrote the articles, mainly against the mayor [[Antonio Bajamonti]] [[Autonomist Party]] policies. Morpurgo was often targeted by the Autonomist Party supporters who repeatedly physically attacked him in the street (in July 1867, July 1868 and during the summer 1870). In 1870 Morpurgo was elected representative of the People's Party in the [[Diet of Dalmatia]], assembly of the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]].&lt;ref name="vmhnp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pjvm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=B.|first=N.|coauthors=|title=Proslavljajući 150. godina knjižare Morpurgo, Split je Zagrebu opalio - pljusku!|pages=|publisher=Moderna vremena Info|date=2010-11-22|url=http://www.mvinfo.hr/najnovije-vijesti.php?ppar=4833|accessdate=2013-06-25|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, Morpurgo founded the first steam brick factory in Split. At home and abroad he was known for his alcoholic beverages company "Morpurgo", largest [[Distillation|distillery]] in Dalmatia. In 1905 Morpurgo merged with [[Emil Stock]] to found the alcoholic beverages company "Morpurgo, Stock e Comp." New company got the franchise to build the new liquor factory near Split (today part of Split). Factory concession was challenged by the municipal prefect Vicko Mihaljević due to environmental issues. Some attributed this problem to the political conflict (Mihaljević was member of the [[Party of Rights]]) between Morpurgo and municipal authorities. Due to the disappointment of failing to get the concession, Morpurgo and Stock built the factory in [[Rovinj]], Croatia.&lt;ref name="vmhnp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pjvm"/&gt;

Morpurgo was also the elected vice president of the "Split Trade Chamber" and later its president. In 1870 Morpurgo co-founded the ''Prva pučka dalmatinska banka'' (''First people's Dalmatian bank'') in order to help Dalmatian farmers regain material independence from the mostly autonomist (members of the Autonomist Party) landowners, small capitalists and usurers who were lending money to farmers and during elections forced them to vote for the Autonomist Party. The bank initially operated in the Morpurgo's bookstore, as he was the first vice-president and later a president.&lt;ref name="vmhnp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pjvm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hnp"&gt;{{harvtxt|Duško Kečkemet|1984|pp=87, 88, 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Morpurgo bookstore.JPG|thumb|right|130px|Vid Morpurgo bookstore in Split, 2012.]]

==Death and legacy==
Morpurgo died on 31 January 1911 in Split. He was buried at the [[Marjan hill]] Jewish cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Novi Omanut (Prilog židovskoj povijesti i kulturi); Jadranka Brnčić; Napokon proučeni život i djelo Luciana Morpurga; stranica 3; broj 113, rujan – listopad 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today many historians agree that Morpurgo's political ideas were aimed at the awakening of Croatian national consciousness, improving the economy of Dalmatia, education and cultural upliftment of its citizens. As a trader, bookseller, banker, publisher and columnist, Morpurgo dedicated his life to the People's Party goals.&lt;ref name="vmhnp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vl"/&gt;

[[File:The Cathedral of St Giles, Edinburgh - geograph.org.uk - 505970.jpg|300px|thumb| Walter Chepman was a patron of The High Kirk of Edinburgh, also known as Saint Giles' Cathedral.]]

'''Walter Chepman''' was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[merchant]], [[Notary public|notary]] and civil servant active in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Chepman served at the Scottish [[Court (royal)|court]] during the reigns of [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] and [[James V of Scotland|James V]]. 
In partnership with [[Androw Myllar]] he established [[Chepman and Myllar Press|Scotland's first printing press]] in 1508.&lt;ref name="C and M prints"&gt;[http://digital.nls.uk/firstscottishbooks/index.html The Chepman and Myllar Prints at the National Library of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NLS Breviary"&gt;[http://digital.nls.uk/74487406 The Aberdeen Breviary at the National Library of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt; Chepman was also a significant patron of [[St Giles' Cathedral|Saint Giles' Kirk]] in [[Edinburgh]].

==Biography==
[[File:Memorial to Walter Chepman.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Walter Chepman in [[St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh|St. Giles' Cathedral]] erected in 1879 by William Chambers LLD.]]
Chepman's first appearance in the historical record is in the accounts of the [[Lord High Treasurer of Scotland]] for 1494 in which he is recorded as receiving payment for clerical work at the royal court.&lt;ref name="ALHTS"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/accountsoflordhi03scot Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol.3 (1901), see index, p.470]&lt;/ref&gt; He would continue to receive such payments for the remainder of his life.

The impression that Chepman was well-educated is supported by the fact that he acted as a notary in and around Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Chepman, Walter|volume=10|pages=186-187|first=Aeneas James George |last=Mackay}}&lt;/ref&gt; His service at court also suggests that he was trusted by King James IV. In 1503, to coincide with the King's marriage, James presented Chepman with a suit of clothes of English fabric.&lt;ref name="ALHTS"/&gt;

Walter Chepman traded in imported textiles and timber and regularly supplied goods to the King.&lt;ref name="ALHTS"/&gt;
He appears to have been a prosperous man. He owned [[tenement]]s in Edinburgh's Blackfriars Wynd&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; and, at the southern end of this wynd where it joined the Southgait, he and Androw Myllar would establish their press.

Chepman was married twice. His first wife was Margaret Kerkettle and, after being widowed, he married Agnes Cockburn.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Chepman died at an unknown point after 1528 and was buried in the chapel he had established at the Kirk of Saint Giles in Edinburgh, now known as the Chepman Aisle.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==The Southgait Press==
[[File:Goldyn Targe.gif|upright|thumb|Walter Chepman's device in his print of The Goldyn Targe.]]
In September 1507 King James IV authorised Walter Chepman and Androw Myllar to establish a printing press and awarded the two partners a monopoly in printed books within Scotland.&lt;ref name="Privy Seal"&gt;The Register Of the Privy Seal of Scotland, 15 September 1507. Scottish National Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; Androw Myllar was also a burgess of Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="Privy Seal"/&gt; He was a bookseller who had previously published books, printed in Rouen, intended for sale in England.

Chepman and Myllar's press was functional by the following Spring and was based in the [[Cowgate|Southgait]] of Edinburgh. Its works included a liturgical text known as [[Aberdeen Breviary|The Aberdeen Breviary]]&lt;ref name="NLS Breviary"/&gt; and 'The Chepman and Myllar Prints'&lt;ref name="C and M prints"/&gt; which were a series of pamphlets containing popular literature in [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[English language|English]].

The press did not have a long working life. The latest surviving example of its work is an edition of the Aberdeen Breviary dating to 1510.&lt;ref name="Dawson"&gt;Jane E. A. Dawson, ''Scotland Re-formed'', The New Edinburgh History of Scotland, Volume 6. Edinburgh University Press, 2007, p.81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious Patronage==

Walter Chepman paid for the foundation of two chapels at the Kirk of Saint Giles in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

The first chapel, founded in 1513 and abutting to the south of the church, offered [[Office of the Dead|masses for the souls]] of Chepman, his first wife and of the King and [[Margaret Tudor|Queen]]. The equivalent part of the modern church is now known as 'The Chepman Aisle'. It contains the seventeenth century tomb of [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose|The Marquess of Montrose]] and a memorial plaque in honour of Walter Chepman donated by the nineteenth century publisher [[William Chambers (publisher)|William Chambers]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1528 Chepman established a mortuary chapel, now lost, in the cemetery of Saint Giles' Kirk. It was dedicated to the performance of masses in honour of Chepman, both his wives, King James V, King James IV and all the Scots who had died at [[Battle of Flodden|Flodden]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

[[File:Deacon Brodie figure.jpg|thumb|Brodie advertising figure on Edinburgh's [[Royal Mile]]]]
'''William Brodie''' (28 September 1741 – 1 October 1788), often known by his title of '''Deacon Brodie''', was a Scottish [[cabinet making|cabinet-maker]], [[Deacon#Scots usage|deacon]] of a trades [[guild]], and [[Edinburgh]] city councillor, who maintained a secret life as a [[housebreaker]], partly for the thrill, and partly to fund his gambling.

==Career==
By day, Brodie was a respectable [[tradesman]] and deacon (president) of the Incorporation of [[Wright]]s, which locally controlled the craft of cabinetmaking; this made him a member of the town council. Part of his work as a cabinetmaker was to install and repair [[Lock (security device)|locks]] and other security mechanisms. He socialised with the gentry of Edinburgh and met the poet [[Robert Burns]] and the painter [[Henry Raeburn]]. He was a member of the Edinburgh Cape Club&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8buM0pK9IpMC&amp;pg=PA26 Deacon Brodie of Edinburgh and Edinburgh Cape Club], Google books&lt;/ref&gt; and was known by the pseudonym "Sir Llyud".

At night, however, Brodie became a housebreaker and thief. He used his daytime work as a way to gain knowledge about the security mechanisms of his customers and to copy their [[Key (lock)|key]]s using [[wax]] impressions. As the foremost locksmith of the city, Brodie was asked to work in the houses of many of the richest members of Edinburgh society. He used the money he made dishonestly to maintain his second life, which included a gambling habit and five children by two [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]es, who did not know of each other and were unknown in the city. He reputedly began his criminal career around 1768, when he copied keys to a bank door and stole £800, then enough to maintain a household for several years. In 1786 he recruited a gang of three thieves, John Brown, a thief on the run from a seven-year sentence of [[Penal transportation|transportation]], George Smith, a locksmith who ran a grocer's shop in the [[Cowgate]], and Andrew Ainslie, a shoemaker.

==Capture and trial==
[[File:Edinburgh. Brodie's Close. Deacon's House Cafe.jpg|thumb|Brodie's Close. Deacon's House Café.]]
The case that led to Brodie's downfall began later in 1788 when he organised an armed raid on an [[excise office]] in Chessel's Court on [[the Canongate]]. Brodie's plan failed. On the same night, Brown approached the authorities to claim a King's Pardon, which had been offered after a previous robbery, and gave up the names of Smith and Ainslie (initially saying nothing of Brodie's involvement). Smith and Ainslie were arrested and the next day Brodie attempted to visit them in prison but was refused. Realising that he had to leave Edinburgh, Brodie escaped to London and then to the [[Netherlands]] intending to flee to the United States but was arrested in [[Amsterdam]] and shipped back to Edinburgh for trial.

The trial of Brodie and Smith started on 27 August 1788. At first there was no hard evidence against Brodie, although the tools of his criminal trade (copied keys, a disguise and pistols) were found in his house and workshops. But with Brown's evidence and Ainslie being persuaded to turn King's Evidence, added to the self-incriminating lines in the letters he had written while on the run, the jury found Brodie and Smith guilty.

Brodie and Smith were hanged at the [[Old Tolbooth]] in the High Street on 1 October 1788, before a crowd of 40,000. According to one tale, Brodie wore a steel collar and silver tube to prevent the hanging from being fatal. It was said that he had bribed the hangman to ignore it and arranged for his body to be removed quickly in the hope that he could later be revived. If so, the plan failed. Brodie was buried in an unmarked grave at the Buccleuch Church in Chapel Street. The ground is now covered by a car park behind university lecture-halls. However, rumours of his being seen in Paris circulated later and gave the story of his scheme to evade death further publicity.

==Popular culture==
Popular [[mythology|myth]] holds that Deacon Brodie built the first gallows in Edinburgh and was also its first victim. Of this [[William Roughead]] in ''Classic Crimes'' states that after research he was sure that although the Deacon may have had some hand in the design, "...it was certainly not of his construction, nor was he the first to benefit by its ingenuity".

[[File:Brodie by day.jpg|120px|thumb|left|Sign at Deacon Brodie's Tavern on Edinburgh's Royal Mile]]
[[File:Brodie by night.jpg|120px|thumb|Brodie's alter ego.]]

{{Main|Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde}}
[[Robert Louis Stevenson]], whose father owned furniture that had been made by Brodie, wrote a play (with [[W. E. Henley]]) entitled ''Deacon Brodie, or The Double Life,'' which was unsuccessful. However, Stevenson remained fascinated by the [[dichotomy]] between Brodie's respectable façade and his real nature, and this paradox inspired him to write the novel ''[[Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|The Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde]],'' which he published in 1886.&lt;ref name="realstory"&gt;{{cite news |last=Oslin |first=Reid |url= http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/chronicle/v9/mr15/horror.html |title=Jekyll and Hyde: The Real Story |work=[[Boston College]] Chronicle |date=15 March 2001 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deacon Brodie is commemorated by a [[public house|pub]] of that name on [[Edinburgh]]'s [[Royal Mile]], on the corner of the [[Royal Mile#Lawnmarket|Lawnmarket]] and Bank Street which leads down to [[the Mound]]; and a close off the Royal Mile, which contained his family residence and workshops, now bears the name "Brodie's Close." A further two pubs carry his name, one in [[New York City]] on the south side of the famous west side 46th Street Restaurant Row between [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth]] and [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|Ninth Avenue]], and the other in [[Ottawa]] on the corner of Elgin and Cooper

The titular character of the novel ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (novel)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'' claims to be descended from Deacon Brodie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Muriel |last=Spark |author-link=Muriel Spark |title=The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie |page=88|title-link=The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (novel) }}&lt;/ref&gt; His double life serves as a metaphor for her duplicity, as well as her self-imposed demise. The novel has been adapted into a [[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (play)|play]], [[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (film)|film]], and [[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (TV series)|television series]].

The "Deacon Brodie" episode of the [[BBC One]] television drama anthology ''[[Screen One]]'' starred [[Billy Connolly]] as Brodie, aired on 8 March 1997, and was made in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0176645|title=Deacon Brodie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
