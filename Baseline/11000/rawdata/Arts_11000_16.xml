      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4983">The [[Arts Council]] of [[Pakistan]] [[Karachi]] is arguably the largest council made for the purpose of promoting [[art]]s and [[culture]] in Pakistan, and perhaps the busiest in terms of organizing events on a yearly basis. Given the kind of [[sociopolitical]] turn that the country has taken with reference to [[religious extremism]], it makes the council all the more significant an institution to uphold and foster the traditions of the arts that aim to give society a balanced approach to life. It is the country's oldest and most famous NGO (non-government organization) that deals in promotion and development of arts and crafts in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;[https://tribune.com.pk/story/1250759/glue-holds-despite-borders-urdu-literature-connects-india-pakistan/ The glue that holds: 'Despite borders, Urdu literature connects India, Pakistan'] The Express Tribune newspaper, Published 1 December 2016, Retrieved 17 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=karachievents&gt;[http://www.karachievents.com/arts-council-pakistan/ Profile of The Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi], Retrieved 17 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawn1&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/378131/karachi-arts-council-auditorium Grants from the government for Arts Council of Pakistan], Dawn newspaper, Published 25 December 2004, Retrieved 17 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==

In 1948, a group of art enthusiasts gathered and formed themselves into a society under the name of ''Karachi [[Fine Arts]] Society''. It was first of its kind to promote and encourage arts and culture in Pakistan. It held exhibitions and promoted activities relating to [[theatre]].

The funds of the society were contributed personally by the members themselves. They had no permanent building of their own. Their meetings were therefore held at the residences of the office bearers. Art exhibitions were held in rented space in private houses. Six years later in 1954, the ''Karachi Fine Arts Society'' was reorganized into a body called the ''Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi''. This organization was registered with the registrar of societies, Karachi, under Act XX1 of 1860. (The Registration Certificate was issued on 10 May 1955). After its formation, the Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi stepped up activities in the field of arts and culture. It also has sponsored production of plays and musical programs - for example, it recently held a ''Musical Tribute Event'' in 2017 in honor of the late [[Bade Fateh Ali Khan]] (Pakistan's famous classical music singer) in its auditorium.&lt;ref name=ArtsCouncil&gt;[http://artscouncil.org.pk/acp/index.php/2017/03/02/tribute-to-music-icon-ustad-fateh-ali-khan/ Tribute to Music icon Ustad Fateh Ali Khan], Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi website, Published 2 March 2017, Retrieved 17 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

New York Times, Books. Janet Maslin. February 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
''Beautiful Boy'' covers a substantial portion of Nic's life and deals with the elder Sheff's struggles of how to respond to a son whom he loves but who is also a danger to his family. Nic steals money from his younger siblings and gets arrested for possession in front of them, and Sheff is forced to install a security system to prevent Nic from breaking in.&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;[http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2008/03/01/beautiful_boy/ My beautiful, drug-addicted boy]. Salon. Katharine Mieszkowski. March 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nic attends many rehabs throughout the memoir, and even with those he relapses many times. The longest stretch of sobriety Nic had, prior to his last relapse in the memoir, was almost two years. He then relapsed once again and went into treatment. By the end of the memoir Sheff tells us that Nic has been sober one year. He hopes with all his heart that this will be the last time, and believes in him once again. But in his mind he knows that a relapse can easily happen again and that it will be very difficult for Nic, his family, and himself. Another theme throughout the memoir is Sheff wondering about how much he is to blame and what he could have done to prevent his son's addiction.&lt;ref name = Salon /&gt;

Throughout the memoir Sheff attends numerous Al-Anon Meetings and therapy sessions. In these different sessions he is continually told of the three Cs: you didn't cause it, you can't control it, and you can't cure it. Sheff has a difficult time accepting these statements throughout the memoir. At the end however, he says that he has come to accept two of the Cs, that he can't control it, and he can't cure it. He realizes that he has done everything he can do to try to help Nic, and knows that it's up to Nic to figure things out. He realizes that the only way Nic will fully recover is if he figures things out himself.

''Beautiful Boy'' became a critical and commercial success. It reached #1 on the [[New York Times Best Seller List|''New York Times'' Best Sellers List]] on April 6, 2008, and again on May 4, 2008. ''Entertainment Weekly'' named it the #1 Best Nonfiction Book of 2008 and it won the [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] Discover Great New Writers Award for nonfiction in 2008. [[Amazon.com]] selected it as one of the "Best Books of 2008" and [[Starbucks]] picked it as one of the few books it would sell in its coffee shops.&lt;ref name = NYT2 /&gt;

==''Tweak: Growing Up on Methamphetamines''==
''Tweak: Growing Up on Methamphetamines'' is a follow-up book and autobiographical memoir written by the son Nic Sheff personally about his own ordeal. It was published as hardcover by Atheneum Books for Young Readers in 336 pages in February 2008 ({{ISBN|9781416913627}}) and later in paperback on January 6, 2009. It became a ''New York Times'' and ''USA Today'' bestselling memoir in its own right.

Nic also wrote his follow-up book ''We All Fall Down: Living with Addiction'' in 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3913">'''The Boros Collection''' is a private collection of [[contemporary art]] by Karen and [[Christian Boros]], which has been on display since 2008 in a [[World War II]] era [[bunker]] (called the ''Reichsbahnbunker)'' in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/12/arts/12iht-bunker.1.6105187.html|title=In a Berlin war bunker, Christian Boros creates a showcase for art|last1=Tzortis|first1=Andreas|website=The New York Times|accessdate=June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The collection comprises artworks in the mediums of sculpture, photography and painting by international contemporary artists. The works are installed on five floors of the bunker, which the architect Jens Casper transformed into a compendium of individual rooms that interconnect on multiple floors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/270277/a-bunker-reborn|title=A Bunker Reborn|last1=Basciano|first1=Oliver|website=ARTINFO}}&lt;/ref&gt;. While some rooms were transformed into classic white cube spaces, others still bare traces of the bunker’s lineage when it was used as a prison, storage facility and techno club&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/arts/28iht-bunker28.html|title=Contemporary Art Finds a Shelter in Berlin|last=Eddy|first=Melissa|date=2012-09-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each exhibition in the bunker additionally includes site-specific works that refer to and interact with the various interior spaces and their history.

The collection is accessible to the public from Thursdays through Sundays only in the form of guided tours via prior application on the website of the collection.

The current collection, “Boros Collection / Bunker Berlin #3” opened in May 2017 and presents recently acquired works as well as pieces from the 1990s and 2000s.

'''Cultural depictions of dogs''' extend back thousands of years to when [[dog]]s were portrayed on the walls of caves. Representations of dogs in art became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved and the relationships between human and canine developed. [[Hunting]] scenes were popular in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. Dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, watchfulness, and love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incredibleart.org/lessons/middle/animals2.htm|title=Animal Symbolism in Many Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As dogs became more domesticated, they were shown as companion animals, often painted sitting on a lady's lap. Throughout the [[art history]] there is an overwhelming presence of dogs as status symbols and pets in painting mainly in the [[Western art]].  The dogs were brought to houses and were allowed to live in the house and cherished as part of the family, and were regarded as mostly in the upper classes who used them for hunting and could afford to feed them. Hunting dogs were generally connected to the aristocracy. Only the nobility were allowed to keep hunting dogs, and this would signal status, and it was the signalment of a noble man. Dog portraits became increasingly popular in the 18th century, and the establishment of [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK in 1873 and the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1884 introduced [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standards]] or 'word pictures', which further encouraged the popularity of dog portraiture.

The walls of caves and tombs dating back to the [[Bronze Age]] have illustrations or statues of dogs. These generally portray dogs used for hunting, and even children's toys and ceramics depicting dogs.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dog|url=http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-15457|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the prehistoric paintings are found in [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]], these paintings depict dog on a [[leash]] with a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sacred Animals of India|page=101|first=Nanditha|last=Krishna|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock art of [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] also include depiction of dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lost History of the Canine Race: Our 15,000-year Love Affair with Dogs|first=Mary Elizabeth|last=Thurston|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Enduring Treasures: National Parks of the World|publisher=National Geographic Society|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Ancient Greeks and Romans, contrary to the Semitic cultures  favored dogs as pets, and valued them for their faithfulness and courage and were often seen on Greek and Roman reliefs and ceramics as symbols of fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/CJ/44/4/Household_Pets*.html|title=Greek and Roman Household Pets |publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats were not favoured over dogs, on contrary Ancient Greeks and Romans didn't keep cats as pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyforkids.net/greek-pets.html|title=Greek pets|publisher=historyforkids.net|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs were given as gifts among lovers and kept them as both  pets, status symbols or kept for guardians and as hunting dogs. Dogs were appreciated by the Greek for their faith and love. [[Homeros]] [[Odyssey]] tells the story of [[Odysseus]] who had a dog called Argos he raised and who was the only one that recognized him when he returned  home after his travels, disguised to conceals his appearance. Only the old dog recognized him instantly. This theme has been often depicted in on ancient Greek vases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/53-3/kitchell.pdf|title=Pets of Ancient Greeks|publisher=www.penn.museum|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Romans kept three types of dogs. Hunting dogs; especially [[sighthound]]s, Molossus type of dogs like the [[Neapolitan Mastiff]]  were often depicted in  reliefs and mosaics with the words Cave Canem; and small companion dogs of [[Maltese (dog)|Maltese]] type as women's [[lap dog]]s. Greyhounds were often depicted too, often as sculptures. Large dogs were often used in war by the Roman army  in attack formations or for wolf-hunting on horseback,  which was a popular sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societasviaromana.net/Collegium_VitaQuotidiana/pets.php|title=Pets in Ancient Rome

[[File:Jan van Eyck 009.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Detail of the dog]]
[[File:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|thumb|Jan van Eyck's ''The Arnolfini Wedding'' (1434).]]
Generally, dogs symbolize [[faith]] and loyalty.&lt;ref name="Hall1979"&gt;{{citation|last=Hall|first=James|title=Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fLjd0fyT0_IC|year=1979|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=978-0-06-430100-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dog, when included in an [[allegory|allegorical]] painting, portrays the attribute of [[fidelity]] personified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|pages=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a portrait of a married couple, a dog placed in a woman's lap or at her feet can represent marital fidelity. If the portrait is of a widow, a dog can represent her continuing faithfulness to the memory of her late husband.&lt;ref name="Hall1979" /&gt;

An example of a dog representing marital fidelity is present in Jan van Eyck's ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]''. An oil painting on [[oak]] [[Panel painting|panel]] dated 1434 by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painter]] [[Jan van Eyck]], it is a small full-length double portrait,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Erwin Panofsky]] published an article entitled ''Jan van Eyck's 'Arnolfini' Portrait'' in the ''[[Burlington Magazine]] 1934&lt;/ref&gt; which is believed to represent the Italian merchant [[Giovanni Arnolfini|Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini]] and his wife,&lt;ref&gt;Stockstad Cothren&lt;/ref&gt; presumably in their home in the [[Flanders|Flemish]] city of [[Bruges]]. It portrays a wedding scene, where the people invited to witness the ceremony can be seen in the convex mirror at the back, the mirror symbolizing the eye of God. In those times people were not always married in the church, it was enough that two witnesses were present to make a wedding legal. A number of symbols can be found in the picture: the fruit, the symbol of fertility and wealth, the shoes removed (this is a holy place), and the dog. The oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may have been one of the items dealt in by Arnolfini. The little dog symbolizes in the Middle Ages [[iconography]]  faithfulness, devotion or [[loyalty]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  or can be seen as an emblem of [[lust]], signifying the couple's desire to have a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jan Van Eyck: The Play of Realism|pages=20–50|first=Craig|last=Harbison|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the couple, the dog looks out to meet the gaze of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, Craig, ''Jan van Eyck, The Play of Realism'', Reaktion Books, London, 1991, {{ISBN|0-948462-18-3}} pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;  The dog could also be simply a lap dog, a gift from husband to wife. Many wealthy women in the court had lap dogs as companions. In that case the dog could reflect wealth or social status.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, Craig, "Sexuality and social standing in Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini double portrait", ''Renaissance Quarterly'', volume 43, issue 2, p. 270, Summer 1990, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2862365 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;
During the Middle Ages, images of dogs were often carved on tombstones to represent the deceased's feudal loyalty or marital fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keister|first=Douglas|title=Stories in Stone: A Field Guide to Cemetery Symbolism and Iconography|year=2004|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Salt Lake City, UT|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hunting scenes===
[[File:Livre de Chasse 40v.jpg|thumb|left|''Livre de Chasse'', French hunting dog book]]

Hunting scenes were common topics in medieval and Renaissance art. Hunting in the medieval period was a sport exclusive to the aristocracy and hunting was an essential part of court etiquette. Depictions of person together with a hunting dog, hawks or falcons would signal status, or was the signalment of a noble man - since the hunting dogs were  connected to aristocracy, and only the nobility was hunting. Hunting was considered as a sport, but also a way of showing bravery, chivalric virtue while hunting dangerous prey such as wild boars and bears. Hunting dogs allow humans to pursue and kill prey that would otherwise be very difficult or dangerous to hunt. Different breeds of dogs were used for different types of hunting. Hunting with dogs was so popular that during the Middle Ages the wild bears had already been hunted to extinction in England.
[[File:ST. Eustachius.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Pisanello]] (1395–1455), hunting scene with dogs (''The Vision of St. Eustachius'')]]
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture, hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply. Hunting filled also a practical necessity, assuring food for the tables of the nobility. Nobles spending their money on packs of specially bred hounds were not unusual.

[[Gaston III, Count of Foix|Gaston Phoebus]] (30 April 1331 – 1391) wrote a manual on hunting and there are several tapestries from the period which depict hunting scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medieval and renaissance hunting|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/m/med-ren-hunting/|publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if nobility was hunting, hunting has been forbidden to servants, peasants and also the Roman Catholic Church [[cleric]]s. Thus the ''Corpus Juris Canonici'' (C. ii, X, De cleric. venat.) says, "We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons." The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]], held under [[Pope Innocent III]], decreed (canon xv): "We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics." The decree of the [[Council of Trent]] is worded more mildly: "Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking" (Sess. XXIV, De reform., c. xii), which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit, and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy (''clamorosa'') hunting unlawful, but not quiet (''quieta'') hunting. Thus, hunting dogs are seldom seen depicted in the company of [[cleric]]s, but very often in the company of in the highest social class of that society.

=== In heraldry===
[[File:Coat of Arms of Henry VII of England (1485-1509).svg|thumb|150px|left|Coats of arms of the [[House of Tudor]]]]
[[File:Coa Hungary Town Ebes.svg|thumb|120px|Coats of arms of the Hungarian town [[Ebes]]]]

For the same reason, depictions of dogs can be found in heraldry. In monarchies, the aristocracy are a class of people  who either possess hereditary titles granted by a monarch or are related to such people, and thanks to the specific connection of the aristocrats with the hunting dogs, dogs were often shown as symbols in heraldry. In the late [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], [[heraldry]] became a highly developed discipline. Dogs of various types, and occasionally of specific breeds, occur as [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] and [[supporter]]s in many [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], and often symbolise courage, vigilance, loyalty and fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120304224608/http://www.scottish-wedding-dreams.com/heraldic-animals.html ~ Heraldry Symbols]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[encaustic tile]]s dating from the 15th century featured a white hound, the Talbot family crest and the inscription "Sir John Talbot" (the [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|1st Earl of Shrewsbury]]). Part of a set of four, the tiles were possibly originally used on a church floor. The term talbot is used in heraldry to refer to a good-mannered hunting dog. The [[Talbot (dog)|Talbot dog]] always depicts the Talbot [[coat of arms]] and is the original hound used as an English heraldic symbol. It is portrayed in the family arms of several noble German families and at least seven other English families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Waters |first=Nick |title=History of the Talbot tiles |url=http://www.dogworld.co.uk/product.php/2223/Features/35-Waters-(2) |accessdate=18 January 2014 |newspaper=[[Dog World (newspaper)|Dog World]] |date=5 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MiPuGlGR?url=http://www.dogworld.co.uk/product.php/2223/Features/35-Waters-%282%29 |archivedate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th and 17th century==
[[File:Ofthedogingeneral.jpg|thumb|150px|A woodcut illustration from ''The history of four-footed beasts and serpents'' by [[Edward Topsell]], 1658]]
During the 16th and 17th century, dogs were depicted in hunting scenes, or depicted representing social status, as a lap dog, or sometimes as a personal friend. They may also used as symbols in painting. The Greek philosopher [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] (404-323 BC) was  depicted by Jean-Léon Gérôme, in the company of dogs that also served as emblems of his "Cynic" (Greek: "kynikos," dog-like) philosophy, which emphasized an austere existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shakespeare's Clown: Actor and Text in the Elizabethan Playhouse|page=155|first=David|last=Wiles|publisher=Cambridge university press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Plato, ''Republic'' Book II&lt;/ref&gt; Diogenes stated that  "Unlike human beings who either dupe others or are duped, dogs will give an honest bark at the truth. Other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them." &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Diogenes of Sinope, quoted by Stobaeus, ''Florilegium'', iii. 13. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek philosopher is seated in his [[abode]], the earthenware tub, - also depicted sometimes in sitting in a [[barrel]], -  in the [[Metroon]], Athens, lighting the lamp in daylight with which he was to go in searching for an honest man.

Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh portrayed probably a scholar noted by its significance to its particular profession,  depicting a book, or a Protestant preacher and theologian with the Bible opened on the table. A dog depicted as a companion to the scholar is a symbol of [[fidelity]], vigilance and regularity in the research due to assigned to dogs natural intelligence and intuition, and the [[parrot]] is a symbol of erudition and [[eloquence]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/rudeness.htm "Logical Rudeness"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==

[[File:Izumiya Tomotada - Netsuke in the Form of a Dog - Walters 711020 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Netsuke]] in the Form of a Dog'']]
Netsuke are Japanese miniature sculptures of great artistic merit that were also serving a practical function as a storage place for kimomos that traditionally had no pockets. These small boxes had a carved, button-like toggle called a ''netsuke''. Most netsuke production was during around 1615&amp;ndash;1868, in the [[Edo period]] in Japan. Among others motifs, netsukes depicted even dogs. 
The tradition of showing dogs in hunting scenes continued through to the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Secord"&gt;{{cite web|title=Victorian England|url=http://www.dogpainting.com/info_detail.cfm?type=referance&amp;info_name=VICTORIANENGLAND&amp;index=2|publisher=William Secord Gallery|accessdate=24 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113235416/http://www.dogpainting.com/info_detail.cfm?type=referance&amp;info_name=VICTORIANENGLAND&amp;index=2|archivedate=13 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture entitled ''A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society'' depicts a dog that was well known in London at that time.  The dog depicted by Sir Edwin Landseer 1838, was a Newfoundland called "Bob", who was found in a shipwreck off the coast of England. The dog found his way to the London waterfront, where he became known for saving people from drowning, a total of twenty-three times over the course of fourteen years. For this, he was made a distinguished member of the [[Royal Humane Society]], granting him a medal and access to food.&lt;ref name=newfoundlandart&gt;{{cite web|title=The Newfoundland in Art &amp; Literature|url=http://www.ncanewfs.org/history/pages/landseer2.html|publisher=Newfoundland Club of America|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Newfoundlanders with white patches are now recognized as a breed of their own,  as a "[[Landseer (dog)|Landseer]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Story|first=George M.|title=Dictionary of Newfoundland English|year=1990|publisher=Univ. of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-8020-5887-4|page=344|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XrVbk3EndTcC&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=%22A+Distinguished+Member+of+the+Humane+Society%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=C61rTpmOOcu38QOQ4vEL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20Distinguished%20Member%20of%20the%20Humane%20Society%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The painting was described by ''[[The Art Journal]]'' 1838 as being "one of the best and most interesting publications of the year", and "Mr Thomas Landseer's first great effort in this department of the art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art Journal|year=1839|publisher=The Art Union|location=London|page=173|volume=I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7TlAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=%22A+Distinguished+Member+of+the+Humane+Society%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=K6drToKMMsju-gbVsZDMCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20Distinguished%20Member%20of%20the%20Humane%20Society%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 19th century copy of the painting by [[George Cole (artist)|George Cole]] was sold by auctioneers [[Bonhams]] for £7,200 in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lot Details: A Distinguished Member of The Humane Society|url=http://www.bonhams.com/eur/auction/14971/lot/12/|publisher=Bonhams|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Victorian era, the mainly sporting tradition remained but after the establishment of [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK in 1873 and the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1884 introduced [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standards]] or 'word pictures', dog portraits soared in popularity.&lt;ref name="Secord" /&gt; There were differences between the British and European style of depiction; William Secord, a world expert on canine art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dog Art  A Muse to Artists and a Delight to Countless Viewers|url=http://www.ralphlaurenhome.com/design/art_gallery_guide/william_secord.aspx|publisher=Ralph Lauren Media|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; described it by stating: "Belgian, Dutch, Flemish and German artists were more influenced by realism, depicting the dog the way it really looked, with dirt on it’s coat and slobber and that kind of thing. You see Alfred Stevens, who's Belgian, do street dogs and dogs that are suffering, which in England you never see. British depictions were more idealized. They want it pretty.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dog Art: The Dog Has Been a Muse to Countless Artists and a Delight to Viewers |url=http://www.artandantiquesmag.com/2012/02/dog-star/ |publisher=Art &amp; Antiques |accessdate=24 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LLfDkUoj?url=http://www.artandantiquesmag.com/2012/02/dog-star/ |archivedate=23 November 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary==

The prices achieved for canine art increased the 1980s–90s and started to gain popularity in established art circles rather than antique markets. Buyers can generally be divided into three dominant categories: hunters; breeders and exhibitors of pedigree dogs; and owners of companion animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silberman|first=Vanessa|title=Who Let the Dogs Out?|journal=Art Business News|date=May 2001|volume=28|issue=5|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-74628439/who-let-the-dogs-out|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of dogs have been extended as well to the artform of [[photography]], a noted example being the work of photographer [[Elliott Erwitt]].

{{Ancient Egyptian religion}}
'''Egyptian temples''' were built for the official worship of the [[ancient Egyptian deities|gods]] and in commemoration of the [[pharaoh]]s in [[ancient Egypt]] and regions under Egyptian control. Temples were seen as houses for the gods or kings to whom they were dedicated. Within them, the Egyptians performed a variety of [[ritual]]s, the central functions of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]]: giving [[Sacrifice|offerings]] to the gods, reenacting their [[Egyptian mythology|mythological]] interactions through festivals, and warding off the forces of chaos. These rituals were seen as necessary for the gods to continue to uphold ''[[maat]]'', the divine order of the universe. Housing and caring for the gods were the obligations of pharaohs, who therefore dedicated prodigious resources to temple construction and maintenance. Out of necessity, pharaohs delegated most of their ritual duties to a host of priests, but most of the populace was excluded from direct participation in ceremonies and forbidden to enter a temple's most sacred areas. Nevertheless, a temple was an important religious site for all classes of Egyptians, who went there to [[prayer|pray]], give offerings, and seek [[oracle|oracular]] guidance from the god dwelling within.

The most important part of the temple was the [[sanctuary]], which typically contained a [[cult image]], a statue of its god. The rooms outside the sanctuary grew larger and more elaborate over time, so that temples evolved from small shrines in late [[Prehistoric Egypt]] (late fourth millennium&amp;nbsp;BC) to large stone edifices in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (c. 1550–1070&amp;nbsp;BC) and later. These edifices are among the largest and most enduring examples of [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|Egyptian architecture]], with their elements arranged and decorated according to complex [[sacred architecture|patterns of religious symbolism]]. Their typical design consisted of a series of enclosed halls, open courts, and entrance [[pylon (architecture)|pylons]] aligned along the path used for festival processions. Beyond the temple proper was an outer wall enclosing a wide variety of secondary buildings.

A large temple also owned sizable tracts of land and employed thousands of laymen to supply its needs. Temples were therefore key economic as well as religious centers. The priests who managed these powerful institutions wielded considerable influence, and despite their ostensible subordination to the king they may have posed significant challenges to his authority.

Temple-building in Egypt continued despite the nation's decline and ultimate [[Egypt (Roman province)|loss of independence]] to the [[Roman Empire]] in 30&amp;nbsp;BC. With the [[Christianity in Egypt|coming of Christianity]], traditional Egyptian religion faced increasing persecution, and [[decline of ancient Egyptian religion|temple cults died out]] during the fourth through sixth centuries AD. The buildings they left behind suffered centuries of destruction and neglect. At the start of the nineteenth century, a [[Egyptomania|wave of interest]] in ancient Egypt swept Europe, giving rise to the discipline of [[Egyptology]] and drawing increasing numbers of visitors to the civilization's remains. Dozens of temples survive today, and some have become world-famous [[Tourism in Egypt|tourist]] attractions that contribute significantly to the modern [[Economy of Egypt|Egyptian economy]]. Egyptologists continue to study the surviving temples and the remains of destroyed ones as invaluable sources of information about ancient Egyptian society.

===Religious===
[[File:Seti before Amun.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Relief showing an ornately dressed Egyptian man reaching toward a male figure on a pedestal|[[Low relief]] of [[Seti I]] performing rituals for the god [[Amun]]]]
[[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[temple]]s were meant as places for the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|gods]] to reside on earth. Indeed, the term the Egyptians most commonly used to describe the temple building, ''ḥwt-nṯr'', means "mansion (or enclosure) of a god".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spencer|1984|pp=22, 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snape|1996|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[divine presence]] in the temple linked the human and divine realms and allowed humans to interact with the god through [[ritual]]. These rituals, it was believed, sustained the god and allowed it to continue to play its proper role in nature. They were therefore a key part of the maintenance of ''[[maat]]'', the ideal order of nature and of human society in Egyptian belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=89–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining ''maat'' was the entire purpose of [[ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was the purpose of a temple as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shafer|1997|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because he was credited with divine power himself,{{refn|Many Egyptologists, such as [[Wolfgang Helck]] and Dietrich Wildung, have argued that the Egyptians did not believe their kings were divine. Nevertheless, the divinity of the king is constantly emphasized in official writings: the products of the royal court and religious establishment. Therefore, regardless of whether ordinary Egyptians believed in it, the king's divine nature is key to the ideology of the Egyptian temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haeny|1997|pp=126, 281}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} the [[pharaoh]], as a [[sacred king]], was regarded as Egypt's representative to the gods and its most important upholder of ''maat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shafer|1997|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it was theoretically his duty to perform the temple rites. While it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt made it impossible for him to do so in all cases, and most of the time these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, and expand the temples throughout his realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=8, 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the pharaoh delegated his authority, the performance of temple rituals was still an official duty, restricted to high-ranking priests. The participation of the general populace in most ceremonies was prohibited. Much of the lay religious activity in Egypt instead took place in private and community [[shrine]]s, separate from the official temples. As the primary link between the human and divine realms, temples attracted considerable veneration from ordinary Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=103, 111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each temple had a principal deity, and most were dedicated to other gods as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=126–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all deities had temples dedicated to them. Many demons and [[Household deity|household gods]] were involved primarily in magical or private religious practice, with little or no presence in temple ceremonies. There were also other gods who had significant roles in the cosmos but, for uncertain reasons, were not honored with temples of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those gods who did have temples of their own, many were venerated mainly in certain areas of Egypt, though many gods with a strong local tie were also important across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Teeter|2001|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even deities whose worship spanned the country were strongly associated with the cities where their chief temples were located. In [[ancient Egyptian creation myths|Egyptian creation myths]], the first temple originated as a shelter for a god—which god it was varied according to the city—that stood on the mound of land where the process of creation began. Each temple in Egypt, therefore, was equated with this original temple and with the site of creation itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reymond|1969|pp=323–327}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the primordial home of the god and the mythological location of the city's founding, the temple was seen as the hub of the region, from which the city's patron god ruled over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|pp=19–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharaohs also built temples where offerings were made to sustain their spirits in the [[Ancient Egyptian religion#Afterlife|afterlife]], often linked with or located near their tombs. These temples are traditionally called "[[mortuary temple]]s" and regarded as essentially different from divine temples. In recent years some Egyptologists, such as Gerhard Haeny, have argued that there is no clear division between the two. The Egyptians did not refer to mortuary temples by any distinct name.&lt;ref name="Haeny 89"&gt;{{harvnb|Haeny|1997|pp=89–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The phrase "mansion of millions of years" is often taken as the Egyptian term for a mortuary temple. In several instances the Egyptians used this phrase to refer to sacred buildings that are not generally regarded as "mortuary", such as [[Luxor Temple]] and the [[Festival Hall of Thutmose III]] at Karnak.&lt;ref name="Haeny 89"/&gt; Patricia Spencer suggests that the term applied to "any temple in which the cult of the king was observed, even if the temple was dedicated, in the first instance, to the chief god of the area."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spencer|1984|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} Nor were rituals for the dead and rituals for the gods mutually exclusive; the symbolism surrounding death was present in all Egyptian temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shafer|1997|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worship of gods was present to some degree in mortuary temples, and the Egyptologist [[Stephen Quirke]] has said that "at all periods royal cult involves the gods, but equally... all cult of the gods involves the king".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirke|1997b|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, certain temples were clearly used to commemorate deceased kings and to give offerings to their spirits. Their exact purpose is not fully understood; they may have been meant to unite the king with the gods, elevating him to a divine status greater than that of ordinary kingship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haeny|1997|pp=123–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the difficulty of separating divine and mortuary temples reflects the close intertwining of divinity and kingship in Egyptian belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shafer|1997|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic and administrative===
Temples were also key centers of economic activity. The largest of them required prodigious resources and employed tens of thousands of priests, craftsmen, and laborers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple's economic workings were analogous to those of a large Egyptian household, with servants dedicated to serving the temple god as they might serve the master of an estate. This similarity is reflected in the Egyptian term for the temple lands and their administration, ''pr'', meaning "house" or "estate".&lt;ref name="Spencer 17"&gt;{{harvnb|Spencer|1984|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the temple's supplies came from direct donations by the king. In the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]], when Egypt was an [[empire|imperial power]], these donations often came out of the spoils of the king's [[Military of ancient Egypt|military]] campaigns or the tribute given by his client states.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king might also levy various taxes that went directly to support a temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katary|2011|pp=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other revenue came from private individuals, who offered land, [[Slavery in Ancient Egypt|slaves]], or goods to temples in exchange for a supply of offerings and priestly services to sustain their spirits in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haring|1997|pp=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nome deities with offerings.JPG.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Relief showing two kneeling people carrying trays piled with plants, jars of liquid, and food|[[Sunk relief]] of personified [[Nome (Egypt)|province]]s of Egypt bearing offerings for the temple god&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Much of a temple's economic support came from its own resources. These included large tracts of land beyond the temple enclosure, sometimes in a completely different region than the temple itself. The most important type of property was [[Ancient Egyptian agriculture|farmland]], producing grain, fruit, or wine, or supporting herds of livestock. The temple either managed these lands directly, rented them out to farmers for a share of the produce, or managed them jointly with the royal administration. Temples also launched expeditions into the desert to collect resources such as salt, honey, or wild game, or to mine precious minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haring|1997|pp=372–379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some owned fleets of ships with which to conduct their own trade across the country or even beyond Egypt's borders. Thus, as [[Richard H. Wilkinson]] says, the temple estate "often represented no less than a slice of Egypt itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=50, 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a major economic center and the employer of a large part of the local population, the temple enclosure was a key part of the town in which it stood. Conversely, when a temple was founded on empty land, a new town was built to support it.&lt;ref name="Kemp 661"&gt;{{harvnb|Kemp|1973|pp=661, 666–667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All this economic power was ultimately under the pharaoh's control, and temple products and property were often taxed. Their employees, even the priests, were subject to the state [[corvée]] system, which conscripted labor for royal projects.&lt;ref name="Katary 4"&gt;{{harvnb|Katary|2011|pp=4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They could also be ordered to provide supplies for some specific purposes. [[Harkhuf]]'s trading expedition in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] was allowed to procure supplies from any temple it wished,&lt;ref name="Katary 4"/&gt; and the mortuary temples of the [[Theban Necropolis]] in the New Kingdom oversaw the provision of the royally employed tomb workers at [[Deir el-Medina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haring|1997|p=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kings could also exempt temples or classes of personnel from taxation and conscription.&lt;ref name="Katary 4"/&gt;

The royal administration could also order one temple to divert its resources to another temple whose influence it wished to expand. Thus, a king might increase the income of the temples of a god he favored, and mortuary temples of recent rulers tended to siphon off resources from temples to pharaohs long dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haring|1997|pp=392–395}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most drastic means of controlling the temple estates was to completely revise the distribution of their property nationwide, which might extend to closing down certain temples. Such changes could significantly alter Egypt's economic landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirke|2001|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temples were thus important instruments with which the king managed the nation's resources and its people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haring|1997|pp=389, 394–396}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the direct overseers of their own economic sphere, the administrations of large temples wielded considerable influence and may have posed a challenge to the authority of a weak pharaoh,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=169–170, 182}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is unclear how independent they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kemp|2006|pp=297–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt became a Roman province]], Roman officials sought to limit temples' power and independence. Temples were made to either pay rent to the government for the land they owned or surrender that land to the state in exchange for a government stipend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Monson|2012|pp=136–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their cults became tightly regulated, less self-supporting, and dependent on government donations&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frankfurter|1998|pp=27, 143}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various small sources of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bagnall|1993|pp=266–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Early development===
The earliest known shrines appeared in prehistoric Egypt in the late fourth millennium&amp;nbsp;BC, at sites such as [[Sais, Egypt|Saïs]] and [[Buto]] in [[Lower Egypt]] and [[Nekhen]] and [[Qift|Coptos]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. Most of these shrines were made of perishable materials such as wood, reed matting, and [[mudbrick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Verner|2013|pp=511–515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the impermanence of these early buildings, later [[art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]] continually reused and adapted elements from them, evoking the ancient shrines to suggest the eternal nature of the gods and their dwelling places.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snape|1996|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] (c. 3100–2686&amp;nbsp;BC), the first pharaohs built funerary complexes in the religious center of [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] following a single general pattern, with a rectangular [[adobe|mud brick]] enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1997|pp=32, 258}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] (c. 2686–2181&amp;nbsp;BC) that followed the Early Dynastic Period, royal funerary monuments greatly expanded, while most divine temples remained comparatively small, suggesting that official religion in this period emphasized the cult of the divine king more than the direct worship of deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deities closely connected with the king, such as the sun god [[Ra]], received more royal contributions than other deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goedicke|1978|pp=121–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ra's temple at [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] was one of the great religious centers of the age, and several Old Kingdom pharaohs built large [[Egyptian sun temple|sun temples]] in his honor near their [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirke|2001|pp=84–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the small provincial temples retained a variety of local styles from Predynastic times, unaffected by the royal cult sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kemp|2006|pp=113–114, 134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pyramide Djedkare Isesi 3.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=Drawing of a pyramid surrounded by a wall. A building with many rooms extends from one side of the pyramid, and at the opposite end of the building a causeway extends out of the frame.|Reconstruction of an Old Kingdom pyramid temple, with causeway leading out to the valley temple]]
The expansion of funerary monuments began in the reign of [[Djoser]], who built his complex entirely of stone and placed in the enclosure a step pyramid under which he was buried: the [[Pyramid of Djoser]]. For the rest of the Old Kingdom, tomb and temple were joined in elaborate stone pyramid complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirke|2001|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near each pyramid complex was a town that supplied its needs, as towns would support temples throughout Egyptian history. Other changes came in the reign of [[Sneferu]] who, beginning with his first pyramid at [[Meidum]], built pyramid complexes symmetrically along an east–west axis, with a valley temple on the banks of the [[Nile]] linked to a pyramid temple at the foot of the pyramid. Sneferu's immediate successors followed this pattern, but beginning in the late Old Kingdom, pyramid complexes combined different elements from the axial plan and from the rectangular plan of Djoser.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehner|1997|pp=18–19, 230–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; To supply the pyramid complexes, kings founded new towns and farming estates on undeveloped lands across Egypt. The flow of goods from these lands to the central government and its temples helped unify the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehner|1997|pp=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rulers of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2055–1650&amp;nbsp;BC) continued building pyramids and their associated complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehner|1997|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rare remains from Middle Kingdom temples, like the one at [[Medinet Madi]], show that temple plans grew more symmetrical during that period, and divine temples made increasing use of stone. The pattern of a [[sanctuary]] lying behind a pillared hall frequently appears in Middle Kingdom temples, and sometimes these two elements are fronted by open courts, foreshadowing the standard temple layout used in later times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Kingdom===
[[File:Pylons and obelisk Luxor temple.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Pair of trapezoidal stone towers flanking a passage, beyond which a row of columns is visible. In front of the towers are several large statues and an obelisk.|Entrance pylon of [[Luxor Temple]], one of the major New Kingdom temples&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|1997|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
With greater power and wealth during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070&amp;nbsp;BC), Egypt devoted still more resources to its temples, which grew larger and more elaborate.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 24"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-ranking priestly roles became permanent rather than rotating positions, and they controlled a large portion of Egypt's wealth. Anthony Spalinger suggests that, as the influence of temples expanded, religious celebrations that had once been fully public were absorbed into the temples' increasingly important festival rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spalinger|1998|pp=245, 247–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important god of the time was [[Amun]], whose main cult center, the [[Precinct of Amun-Re]] at [[Karnak]] in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], eventually became the largest of all temples, and whose [[High Priests of Amun|high priests]] may have wielded considerable political influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=52, 174–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many temples were now built entirely of stone, and their general plan became fixed, with the sanctuary, halls, courtyards, and pylon gateways oriented along the path used for festival processions. New Kingdom pharaohs ceased using pyramids as funerary monuments and placed their tombs a great distance from their mortuary temples. Without pyramids to build around, mortuary temples began using the same plan as those dedicated to the gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snape|1996|pp=29–33, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the New Kingdom, Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] promoted the god [[Aten]] over all others and eventually abolished the official worship of most other gods. Traditional temples were neglected while new Aten temples, differing sharply in design and construction, were erected. But Akhenaten's revolution was reversed soon after his death, with the traditional cults reinstated and the new temples dismantled. Subsequent pharaohs dedicated still more resources to the temples, particularly [[Ramesses II]], the most prolific monument-builder in Egyptian history.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 24"/&gt; As the wealth of the priesthoods continued to grow, so did their religious influence: temple oracles, controlled by the priests, were an increasingly popular method of making decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharaonic power waned, and in the eleventh century BC a military leader, [[Herihor]], made himself High Priest of Amun and the de facto ruler of [[Upper Egypt]], beginning the political fragmentation of the [[Third Intermediate Period]] (c. 1070–664&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kemp|2006|pp=299–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the New Kingdom crumbled, the building of mortuary temples ceased and was never revived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1999|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some rulers of the Third Intermediate Period, such as those at [[Tanis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Verner|2013|pp=334–341}}&lt;/ref&gt; were buried within the enclosures of divine temples, thus continuing the close link between temple and tomb.&lt;ref name="Gundlach 379"&gt;{{harvnb|Gundlach|2001|p=379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later development===
In the Third Intermediate Period and the following [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]] (664–323 BC), the weakened Egyptian state fell to a series of outside powers, experiencing only occasional periods of independence. Many of these foreign rulers funded and expanded temples to strengthen their claim to the kingship of Egypt.&lt;ref name="Sauneron 183"&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such group, the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Kushite pharaohs]] of the eighth and seventh centuries&amp;nbsp;BC, adopted Egyptian-style temple architecture for use in their [[Kingdom of Kush|native land of Nubia]], beginning a long tradition of sophisticated [[Nubian architecture|Nubian temple]] building.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1999|pp=46, 308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid this turmoil, the fortunes of various temples and clergies shifted and the independence of Amun's priesthood was broken, but the power of the priesthood in general remained.&lt;ref name="Sauneron 183"/&gt;

[[File:Flickr - Gaspa - Dendara, mammisi romano (7).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Small stone building surrounded by half-walls and columns with elaborate capitals|Roman-era [[mammisi]] at [[Dendera Temple]]]]
Despite the political upheaval, the Egyptian temple style continued to evolve without absorbing much foreign influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finnestad|1997|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas earlier temple building mostly focused on male gods, goddesses and child deities grew increasingly prominent. Temples focused more on popular religious activities such as oracles, [[Animal worship|animal cults]], and prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1999|pp=65, 308}}&lt;/ref&gt; New architectural forms continued to develop, such as covered kiosks in front of gateways, more elaborate [[column]] styles, and the ''[[mammisi]]'', a building celebrating the mythical birth of a god.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold 1999, pp. 282–286, 298&lt;/ref&gt; Though the characteristics of the late temple style had developed by the last period of native rule, most of the examples date from the era of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] kings who [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|ruled as pharaohs]] for nearly 300 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1999|pp=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Roman Empire|Rome]] conquered the Ptolemaic kingdom in 30&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Roman emperor]]s took on the role of ruler and temple patron,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing the temples' wealth and political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frankfurter|1998|pp=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many temples in Roman Egypt continued to be built in Egyptian style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1999|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, including some that were dedicated to Egyptian gods—such as the temple to [[Isis]] at Ras el-Soda—were built in a style derived from [[Roman architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naerebout|2007|pp=524–529, 545–547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple-building continued into the third century&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Monson|2012|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the empire weakened in the [[crisis of the third century]], imperial donations to the temple cults dried up, and almost all construction and decoration ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bagnall|1993|pp=261, 267–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cult activities at some sites continued, relying increasingly on financial support and volunteer labor from surrounding communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frankfurter|1998|pp=72–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following centuries, [[State church of the Roman Empire|Christian emperors]] issued decrees that were increasingly hostile to pagan cults and temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lavan|2011|pp=xxii–xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Christians attacked and destroyed temples, as in the plundering of the [[Serapeum]] and other temples in [[Alexandria]] in AD 391 or 392.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hahn|Emmel|Gotter|2008|pp=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hahn|2008|pp=344, 353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through some combination of Christian coercion and loss of funds, temples ceased to function at various times. The last temple cults died out in the fourth through sixth centuries&amp;nbsp;AD, although locals may have venerated some sites long after the regular ceremonies there had ceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dijkstra|2011|pp=398–409, 423–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Many temples were abandoned during or before the third century, although mentions of priests in [[papyrus]] texts show that some cults continued to exist until at least the 330s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bagnall|1993|pp=261–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Temple of Isis at Philae, at Egypt's southern frontier with Nubia, was the last fully functioning temple. Scholars have traditionally believed, based on the writings of [[Procopius]], that it was closed in about AD 535 by a military expedition under [[Justinian I]]. Jitse Dijkstra has argued that Procopius' account of the temple closure is inaccurate and that regular religious activity there ceased shortly after the last date inscribed at the temple, in AD 456 or 457.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dijkstra|2011|pp=421–430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eugene Cruz-Uribe suggests instead that during the fifth and early sixth centuries the temple lay empty most of the time, but that Nubians living nearby continued to hold periodic festivals there until well into the sixth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cruz-Uribe|2010|pp=505–506}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}}

==Construction==
{{further information|Ancient Egyptian architecture}}
[[File:Ägyptisch-Hethitischer Friedensvertrag Karnaktempel.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A stone wall that has eroded so that the joints between blocks are exposed. The blocks have straight edges but uneven shapes.|Stone construction in a temple wall]]
Temples were built throughout [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]], as well as at Egyptian-controlled [[oasis|oases]] in the [[Libyan Desert]] as far west as [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]], and at outposts in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] such as [[Timna valley|Timna]]. In periods when Egypt dominated Nubia, Egyptian rulers also built temples there, as far south as [[Jebel Barkal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=100, 233, 234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Egyptian towns had a temple,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in some cases, as with mortuary temples or the temples in Nubia, the temple was a new foundation on previously empty land.&lt;ref name="Kemp 661"/&gt; The exact site of a temple was often chosen for religious reasons; it might, for example, be the mythical birthplace or burial place of a god. The temple axis might also be designed to align with locations of religious significance, such as the site of a neighboring temple or the rising place of the sun or particular stars. The Great Temple of [[Abu Simbel]], for instance, is aligned so that twice a year the rising sun illuminates the statues of the gods in its innermost room. Most temples were aligned toward the Nile with an axis running roughly east–west.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 36"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=36–37, 226}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Because the axis was aligned at 90 degrees from the river's generally north–south flow, irregularities in the Nile's course meant that the orientation did not always conform to true directions.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 36"/&gt;|group="Note"}}

An elaborate series of foundation rituals preceded construction. A further set of rituals followed the temple's completion, dedicating it to its patron god. These rites were conducted, at least in theory, by the king as part of his religious duties; indeed, in Egyptian belief all temple construction was symbolically his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, it was the work of hundreds of his subjects, conscripted in the [[corvée]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1991|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction process for a new temple, or a major addition to an existing one, could last years or decades.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 43"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[stonemasonry|use of stone]] in Egyptian temples emphasized their purpose as eternal houses for the gods and set them apart from buildings for the use of mortals, which were built of mudbrick.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early temples were built of brick and other perishable materials, and most of the outlying buildings in temple enclosures remained brick-built throughout Egyptian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=19, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main stones used in temple construction were [[limestone]] and [[sandstone]], which are common in Egypt; stones that are harder and more difficult to carve, such as [[granite]], were used in smaller amounts for individual elements like [[obelisk]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1991|pp=27, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone to build a temple might be quarried nearby or shipped on the Nile from [[Stone quarries of ancient Egypt|quarries]] elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple structures were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1991|pp=109–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most periods, walls and other structures were built with large blocks of varying shape.&lt;ref name="Arnold 120"&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1991|pp=120–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In their earliest stone constructions the Egyptians made small blocks shaped like mud bricks. Large blocks were typical of all other periods, except in the [[Amarna period]], when temples to the Aten were built with small, standardized ''[[talatat]]'' blocks, possibly to speed up construction.&lt;ref name="Arnold 120"/&gt; Ptolemaic and Roman temples were built in regular courses, with the blocks within each course cut to the same height.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1999|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} The blocks were laid in courses, usually without [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. Each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors, producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1991|pp=115–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using rougher, poorer-quality stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1991|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; To build structures above ground level, the workers used construction ramps built of varying materials such as mud, brick, or rough stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1991|pp=80–81, 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[rock-cut architecture|cutting chambers in living rock]], workers excavated from the top down, carving a crawlspace near the ceiling and cutting down to the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1991|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were dressed to create a smooth surface. In decorating these surfaces, [[relief]]s were carved into the stone or, if the stone was of too poor quality to carve, a layer of plaster that covered the stone surface.&lt;ref name="Robins 20"&gt;{{harvnb|Robins|1986|pp=20–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reliefs were then decorated with [[gilding]], [[inlay]], or paint.&lt;ref name="Uphill"&gt;{{harvnb|Uphill|1973|pp=730–731}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments with some kind of adhesive, possibly [[natural gum]].&lt;ref name="Robins 20"/&gt;

Temple construction did not end once the original plan was complete; pharaohs often rebuilt or replaced decayed temple structures or made additions to those still standing. In the course of these additions, they frequently dismantled old temple buildings to use as fill for the interiors of new structures. On rare occasions this may have been because the old structures or their builders had become anathema, as with Akhenaten's temples, but in most cases the reason seems to have been convenience. Such expansion and dismantling could considerably distort the original temple plan, as happened at the enormous Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak, which developed two intersecting axes and several satellite temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=77–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and decoration==
[[File:SFEC AEH -ThebesNecropolis-2010-RamsesIII045-3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Rectangular stone building from above, with courtyards and pylons at the front and the remains of walls at the back. A rectangular wall and the foundations of other buildings surround the main building.|The temple of [[Ramesses III]] at [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]], surrounded by the remains of subsidiary structures]]
Like all [[ancient Egyptian architecture]], Egyptian temple designs emphasized order, symmetry, and monumentality and combined geometric shapes with stylized organic motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2001|pp=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of temple design also alluded to the form of the earliest Egyptian buildings. [[Cavetto cornice]]s at the tops of walls, for instance, were made to imitate rows of palm fronds placed atop archaic walls, and the [[grade (slope)|batter]] of exterior walls, while partly meant to ensure stability, was also a holdover from archaic building methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2003|pp=28, 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temple ground plans usually centered on an axis running on a slight incline from the sanctuary down to the temple entrance. In the fully developed pattern used in the New Kingdom and later, the path used for festival processions—a broad avenue punctuated with large doors—served as this central axis. The path was intended primarily for the god's use when it traveled outside the sanctuary; on most occasions people used smaller side doors.&lt;ref name="Assmann 31"&gt;{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|pp=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical parts of a temple, such as column-filled [[hypostyle hall]]s, open [[peristyle]] courts, and towering entrance [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]]s, were arranged along this path in a traditional but flexible order. Beyond the temple building proper, the outer walls enclosed numerous satellite buildings.  The entire area enclosed by these walls is sometimes called the ''[[temenos]]'', the sacred precinct dedicated to the god.&lt;ref name="Dunand 79"&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=79–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple pattern could vary considerably, apart from the distorting effect of additional construction. Many temples, known as [[hypogea]], were cut entirely into living rock, as at Abu Simbel, or had rock-cut inner chambers with masonry courtyards and pylons, as at [[Wadi es-Sebua]]. They used much the same layout as free-standing temples but used excavated chambers rather than buildings as their inner rooms. In some temples, like the mortuary temples at [[Deir el-Bahari]], the processional path ran up a series of terraces rather than sitting on a single level. The Ptolemaic [[Temple of Kom Ombo]] was built with two main sanctuaries, producing two parallel axes that run the length of the building. The most idiosyncratic temple style was that of the Aten temples built by Akhenaten at [[el-Amarna]], in which the axis passed through a series of entirely open courts filled with altars.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snape|1996|pp=44–51, 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional design was a highly symbolic variety of [[sacred architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a greatly elaborated variant on the design of an Egyptian house, reflecting its role as the god's home.&lt;ref name="Spencer 17"/&gt; Moreover, the temple represented a piece of the divine realm on earth. The elevated, enclosed sanctuary was equated with the sacred hill where the world was created in Egyptian myth and with the burial chamber of a tomb, where the god's ''[[Egyptian soul#Ba|ba]]'', or spirit, came to inhabit its cult image just as a human ''ba'' came to inhabit its [[mummy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|pp=38, 43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; This crucial place, the Egyptians believed, had to be insulated from the impure outside world.&lt;ref name="Assmann 31"/&gt; Therefore, as one moved toward the sanctuary the amount of outside light decreased, and restrictions on who could enter increased. Yet the temple could also represent the world itself. The processional way could therefore stand for the path of the sun traveling across the sky, and the sanctuary for the [[Duat]] where it was believed to set and to be reborn at night. The space outside the building was thus equated with the waters of chaos that lay outside the world, while the temple represented the order of the cosmos and the place where that order was continually renewed.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 76"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=76–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inner chambers===
The temple's inner chambers centered on the sanctuary of the temple's primary god, which typically lay along the axis near the back of the temple building, and in pyramid temples directly against the pyramid base. The sanctuary was the focus of temple ritual, the place where the divine presence manifested most strongly. The form in which it manifested itself varied. In Aten temples and [[Egyptian sun temple|traditional solar shrines]], the object of ritual was the sun itself or a ''[[benben]]'' stone representing the sun, worshipped in a court open to the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirke|2001|pp=64–65, 88, 159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many mortuary temples, the inner areas contained statues of the deceased pharaoh, or a [[false door]] where his [[ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#bꜣ (personality)|bꜣ]] ("personality", Egyptological ''ba'') was believed to appear to receive offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1997|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edfu naos.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Small room with a cabinet-like structure near the back|Shrine in the [[cella]] of the [[Temple of Edfu]]]]
In most temples, the focus was the [[cult image]]: a statue of the temple god which that god's ''ba'' was believed to inhabit while interacting with humans.{{refn|No surviving statues of deities are known for certain to have been cult images, although a few have the right characteristics to have served that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kozloff|2001|pp=242–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} The sanctuary in these temples contained either a [[Shrine|naos]], a cabinet-like shrine that housed the divine image, or a model [[Barque#Barques and barque shrines in Ancient Egypt|barque]] containing the image within its cabin, which was used to carry the image during festival processions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the sanctuary may have housed several cult statues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eaton|2013|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; To emphasize the sanctuary's sacred nature, it was kept in total darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in earlier times the sanctuary lay at the very back of the building, in the Late and Ptolemaic periods it became a freestanding building inside the temple, further insulated from the outside world by the surrounding corridors and rooms.&lt;ref name="Assmann 31"/&gt;

Subsidiary chapels, dedicated to deities associated with the primary god, lay to the sides of the main one. When the main temple god was male, the secondary chapels were often dedicated to that god's mythological consort and child. The secondary chapels in mortuary temples were devoted to gods associated with kingship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=70, 82, 178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other rooms neighbored the sanctuary. Many of these rooms were used to store ceremonial equipment, ritual texts, or temple valuables; others had specific ritual functions. The room where offerings were given to the deity was often separate from the sanctuary itself, and in temples without a barque in the sanctuary, there was a separate shrine to store the barque.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late temples the ritual areas could extend to chapels on the roof and crypts below the floor.&lt;ref name="Dunand 79"/&gt; Finally, in the exterior wall at the back of the temple, there were often niches for laymen to pray to the temple god, as close as they could come to its dwelling place.&lt;ref name="Teeter 77"&gt;{{harvnb|Teeter|2011|pp=77–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halls and courts===
[[File:SFEC EGYPT ESNA 2006-012.JPG|thumb|right|upright|alt=Large, shadowy room filled with tall, thick columns. The column capitals are shaped like stylized flowers.|Hypostyle hall of [[Esna Temple]]]]
Hypostyle halls, covered rooms filled with columns, appear in temples throughout Egyptian history. By the New Kingdom they typically lay directly in front of the sanctuary area.&lt;ref name="Arnold 113"&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2003|pp=113, 180}}&lt;/ref&gt; These halls were less restricted than the inner rooms, being open to laymen at least in some cases.&lt;ref name="Teeter 77"/&gt; They were often less dark as well: New Kingdom halls rose into tall central passages over the processional path, allowing a [[clerestory]] to provide dim light. The epitome of this style is the [[Great Hypostyle Hall]] at Karnak, whose largest columns are {{convert|69|ft|m|0}} tall. In later periods, the Egyptians favored a different style of hall, where a low screen wall at the front let in the light.&lt;ref name="Arnold 113"/&gt; The shadowy halls, whose columns were often shaped to imitate plants such as [[Lotus (plant)|lotus]] or [[papyrus]], were symbolic of the mythological marsh that surrounded the primeval mound at the time of creation. The columns could also be equated with the pillars that held up the sky in Egyptian cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the hypostyle hall were one or more [[peristyle]] courts open to the sky. These open courts, which had been a part of Egyptian temple design since the Old Kingdom, became transitional areas in the standard plan of the New Kingdom, lying between the public space outside the temple and the more restricted areas within. Here the public met with the priests and assembled during festivals. At the front of each court was usually a [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]], a pair of trapezoidal towers flanking the main gateway. The pylon is known from only scattered examples in the Old and Middle Kingdoms, but in the New it quickly became the distinctive and imposing façade common to most Egyptian temples. The pylon served symbolically as a guard tower against the forces of disorder and may also have been meant to resemble the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]] for "horizon", underscoring the temple's solar symbolism.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 60"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The front of every pylon held niches for pairs of flagpoles to stand. Unlike pylons, such flags had stood at temple entrances since the earliest Predynastic shrines. They were so closely associated with the presence of a deity that the hieroglyph for them came to stand for the Egyptian word for "god".&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 60"/&gt;

===Enclosure===
Outside the temple building proper was the temple enclosure, surrounded by a rectangular brick wall that symbolically protected the sacred space from outside disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shafer|1997|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion this function was more than symbolic, especially during the last native dynasties in the fourth century BC, when the walls were fully fortified in case of invasion by the [[Achaemenid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1999|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late temples these walls frequently had alternating concave and convex courses of bricks, so that the top of the wall undulated vertically. This pattern may have been meant to evoke the mythological waters of chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2003|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Egyptian vignettes luxor.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Vaulted brick buildings|Brick storehouses at the [[Ramesseum]]]]
The walls enclosed many buildings related to the temple's function. Some enclosures contain satellite chapels dedicated to deities associated with the temple god, including [[mammisi]]s celebrating the birth of the god's mythological child. Sacred lakes found in many temple enclosures served as reservoirs for the water used in rituals, as places for the priests to ritually cleanse themselves and as representations of the water from which the world emerged.&lt;ref name="Dunand 79"/&gt;

[[Mortuary temple]]s sometimes contain a palace for the spirit of the king to whom the temple was dedicated, built against the temple building proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2003|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mortuary Temple of Seti I]] at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] incorporates an unusual underground structure, the [[Osireion]], which may have served as a symbolic tomb for the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Snape|1996|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanatoria]] in some temples provided a place for the sick to await healing dreams sent by the god. Other temple buildings included kitchens, workshops, and storehouses to supply the temple's needs.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 74"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially important was the ''[[wikt:pr ꜥnḫ|pr ꜥnḫ]]'' "house of life", where the temple edited, copied, and stored its religious texts, including those used for temple rituals. The house of life also functioned as a general center of learning, containing works on non-religious subjects such as history, geography, [[Egyptian astronomy|astronomy]], and [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=132–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these outlying buildings were devoted to more mundane purposes than the temple itself, they still had religious significance; even [[granary|granaries]] might be used for specific ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 74"/&gt;

Through the enclosure ran the processional path, which led from the temple entrance through the main gate in the enclosure wall. The path was frequently decorated with [[sphinx]] statues and punctuated by barque stations, where the priests carrying the festival barque could set it down to rest during the procession. The processional path usually ended in a quay on the Nile, which served as the entrance point for river-borne visitors and the exit point for the festival procession when it travelled by water.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Old Kingdom pyramid temples, the quay adjoined an entire temple (the valley temple), which was linked to the pyramid temple by the processional causeway.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2003|pp=227, 252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple building was elaborately decorated with reliefs and free-standing sculpture, all with religious significance. As with the cult statue, the gods were believed to be present in these images, suffusing the temple with sacred power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols of places in Egypt or parts of the cosmos enhanced the mythical geography already present in the temple's architecture. Images of rituals served to reinforce the rituals' magical effect and to perpetuate that effect even if the rituals ceased to be performed. Because of their religious nature, these decorations showed an idealized version of reality, emblematic of the temple's purpose rather than real events.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gundlach|2001|pp=369, 371–372}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the king was shown performing most rituals, while priests, if depicted, were secondary. It was unimportant that he was rarely present for these ceremonies; it was his broader role as intermediary with the gods that mattered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eaton|2013|pp=28, 121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important form of decoration is relief.&lt;ref name="Gundlach 371"&gt;{{harvnb|Gundlach|2001|p=371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relief became more extensive over time, and in late temples, walls, ceilings, columns, and beams were all decorated,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finnestad|1997|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; as were free-standing [[stela]]e erected within the enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hölzl|2001|pp=320–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian artists used both bas relief and [[sunken relief]]. Bas relief allowed more subtle artistry but involved more carving than sunken relief. Sunken relief was therefore used on harder, more difficult stone and when the builders wanted to finish quickly.&lt;ref name="Robins 20"/&gt; It was also appropriate for exterior surfaces, where the shadows it created made the figures stand out in bright sunlight.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 43"/&gt; Finished reliefs were painted using the basic colors black, white, red, yellow, green, and blue, although the artists often mixed pigments to create other colors,&lt;ref name="Robins 20"/&gt; and Ptolemaic temples were especially colorful, using unusual colors such as purple as accents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|1999|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some temples, gilding or inlaid pieces of colored glass or [[Egyptian faience|faience]] substituted for paint.&lt;ref name="Uphill"/&gt;

Temple decoration is among the most important sources of information on Ancient Egypt. It includes calendars of festivals, accounts of myths, depictions of rituals, and the texts of hymns. Pharaohs recorded their temple-building activities and their campaigns against the enemies of Egypt.&lt;ref name="Gundlach 371"/&gt; The Ptolemaic temples go further to include information of all kinds taken from temple libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finnestad|1997|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decoration in a given room either depicts the actions performed there or has some symbolic tie to the room's purpose, providing a great deal of information on temple activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arnold|2003|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interior walls were divided into several [[register (art)|registers]]. The lowest registers were decorated with plants representing the primeval marsh, while the ceilings and tops of walls were decorated with stars and flying birds to represent the sky.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 76"/&gt; Illustrations of rituals, surrounded by text related to the rituals, often filled the middle and upper registers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eaton|2013|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courts and exterior walls often recorded the king's military exploits. The pylon showed the "smiting scene", a motif in which the king strikes down his enemies, symbolizing the defeat of the forces of chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text on the walls was the formal [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic script]]. Some texts were written in a "cryptographic" form, using symbols in a different way than the normal conventions of hieroglyphic writing. Cryptographic text became more widespread and more complex in Ptolemaic times. Temple walls also frequently bear written or drawn [[graffiti]], both in modern languages and in ancient ones such as [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Latin]], and [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]], the form of Egyptian that was commonly used in Greco-Roman times. Although not part of the temple's formal decoration, graffiti can be an important source of information about its history, both when its cults were functioning and after its abandonment. Ancient graffiti, for instance, often mention the names and titles of priests who worked in the temple, and modern travelers often inscribed their names in temples that they visited.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graffiti left by priests and pilgrims at Philae include the [[Graffito of Esmet-Akhom|last ancient hieroglyphic text]], inscribed in AD 394, and the last one in Demotic script, from AD 452.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dijkstra|2011|p=423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monumental sculpture|Large, free-standing sculpture]] included [[obelisk]]s, tall, pointed pillars that symbolized the sun. The largest of them, the [[Lateran Obelisk]], was more than {{convert|118|ft|m|0}} high.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirke|2001|pp=62, 134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were often placed in pairs in front of pylons or elsewhere along the temple axis. Statues of the king, which were similarly placed, also reached colossal size; the [[Colossi of Memnon]] at the [[mortuary temple of Amenhotep III]] and the statue of Ramesses II at the [[Ramesseum]] are the largest free-standing statues made in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=57–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also figures of gods, often in sphinx form, that served as symbolic guardians of the temple. The most numerous statues were votive figures donated to the temple by kings, private individuals, or even towns to gain divine favor. They could depict the god to whom they were dedicated, the people who donated the statue, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kozloff|2001|pp=242–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most essential temple statues were the cult images, which were usually made of or decorated with precious materials such as gold and [[lapis lazuli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==

A temple needed many people to perform its rituals and support duties. Priests performed the temple's essential ritual functions, but in Egyptian religious ideology they were far less important than the king. As temple decoration illustrates, all ceremonies were, in theory, acts by the king, and priests merely stood in his place. The priests were therefore subject to the king's authority, and he had the right to appoint anyone he wished to the priesthood. In fact, in the Old and Middle Kingdoms most priests were government officials who left their secular duties for part of the year to serve the temple in shifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=32–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the priesthood became more professional, the king seems to have used his power over appointments mainly for the highest-ranking positions, usually to reward a favorite official with a job or to intervene for political reasons in the affairs of an important cult. Lesser appointments he delegated to his [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]] or to the priests themselves. In the latter case, the holder of an office named his own son as his successor, or the temple clergy conferred to decide who should fill an empty post.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=43–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priestly offices were extremely lucrative and tended to be held by the wealthiest and most influential members of Egyptian society,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1986|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; until Roman economic reforms reduced the temples’ resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Monson|2012|pp=218–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements for the priesthood differed over time and among the cults of different gods. Although detailed theological knowledge was involved in priestly offices, little is known about what knowledge or training may have been required of the officeholders. Priests were required to observe strict standards of [[Ritual purification|ritual purity]] in the sacred space. They shaved their heads and bodies, washed several times a day, and wore only clean linen clothing. They were not required to be [[celibacy|celibate]], but sexual intercourse rendered them unclean until they underwent further purification. The cults of specific gods might impose further restrictions related to that god's mythology, such as rules against eating the meat of an animal that represented the god.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=35–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptance of women into the priesthood was variable. In the Old Kingdom many women served as priests, but their presence in clergies declined drastically in the Middle Kingdom before increasing in the [[Third Intermediate Period]]. Lesser positions, such as that of musician in ceremonies, remained open to women in even the most restrictive periods, as did the special role of ceremonial consort of the god. This latter role was highly influential, and the most important of these consorts, the [[God's Wife of Amun]], even supplanted the High Priest of Amun during the Late Period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doxey|2001|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the head of the temple hierarchy was the high priest, who oversaw all the temple's religious and economic functions and in the largest cults was an important political figure. Beneath him might be as many as three grades of subordinate priests who could substitute for him in ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Teeter|2011|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these higher ranks were full-time positions from the New Kingdom onward, the lower grades of priesthood still worked in shifts over the course of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doxey|2001|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas many priests did a variety of menial tasks, the clergy also contained several ritual specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=60, 70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent among these specialized roles was that of the [[lector priest]] who recited hymns and spells during temple rituals, and who hired out his magical services to laymen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ritner|1993|pp=220, 232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides its priests, a large temple employed singers, musicians, and dancers to perform during rituals, plus the farmers, bakers, artisans, builders, and administrators who supplied and managed its practical needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ptolemaic era, temples could also house people who had sought [[Right of asylum|asylum]] within the precinct, or [[recluse]]s who voluntarily dedicated themselves to serving the god and living in its household.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=306–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major cult, therefore, could have well over 150 full or part-time priests,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Janssen|1978|pp=121–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; with tens of thousands of non-priestly employees working on its lands across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haring|1997|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers contrast with mid-sized temples, which may have had 10 to 25 priests, and with the smallest provincial temples, which might have only one.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some priests' duties took them beyond the temple precinct. They formed part of the entourage in festivals that traveled from one temple to another, and clergies from around the country sent representatives to the national [[sed festival]] that reinforced the king's divine power. Some temples, such as those in the neighboring cities of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and [[Letopolis]], were overseen by the same high priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At certain times there was an administrative office that presided over all temples and clergies. In the Old Kingdom, pharaohs gave this authority first to their relatives and then to their viziers. In the reign of [[Thutmose III]] the office passed from the viziers to the High Priests of Amun, who held it for much of the New Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=176–177, 186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans established a similar office, that of the high priest for all Egypt, which oversaw the temple cults until their extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Monson|2012|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious activities==

===Daily rituals===
The daily rituals in most temples included two sequences of [[sacrifice|offering]] rites: one to clean and dress the god for the day, and one to present it with a meal. The exact order of events in these rituals is uncertain and may have varied somewhat each time they were performed. In addition, the two sequences probably overlapped with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eaton|2013|pp=41–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; At sunrise, the officiating priest entered the sanctuary, carrying a candle to light the room. He opened the doors of the shrine and prostrated himself before the god's image, reciting hymns in its praise. He removed the god from the shrine, clothed it (replacing the clothes of the previous day), and anointed it with oil and paint.&lt;ref name="Dunand 90"&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some point the priest presented the god's meal, including a variety of meats, fruits, vegetables, and bread.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|2001|p=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The god was believed to consume only the spiritual essence of this meal. This belief allowed the food to be distributed to others, an act that the Egyptians called the "reversion of offerings". The food passed first to the other statues throughout the temple, then to local funerary chapels for the sustenance of the dead, and finally to the priests who ate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Englund|2001|p=566}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The quantities even for the daily meal were so large that only a small part of it can have been placed on the offering tables. Most of it must have gone directly to these secondary uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Janssen|1978|p=512}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}}

Temple artwork often shows the king presenting an image of the goddess [[Maat]] to the temple deity, an act that represented the purpose of all other offerings.&lt;ref name="Dunand 90"/&gt;{{refn|The king may have presented a real figurine of Maat to the deity, or the temple reliefs depicting the act may have been purely symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eaton|2013|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}}

Other offering rituals took place at noon and at sunset, though the sanctuary was not reopened.&lt;ref name="Dunand 90"/&gt; Some ceremonies other than offerings also took place daily, including rituals specific to a particular god. In the cult of the sun god [[Ra]], for instance, hymns were sung day and night for every hour of the god's journey across the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirke|2001|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ceremonies acted out in ritual the battle against of the forces of chaos. They might, for instance, involve the destruction of models of inimical gods like [[Apep]] or [[Set (deity)|Set]], acts that were believed to have a real effect through the principle of ''[[heku|ḥkꜣ]]'' ([[Egyptian language#Egyptological pronunciation|Egyptological pronunciation]] ''heka'', Coptic: {{Script/Coptic|ϩⲓⲕ}} ''hik'';&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/coptic-dictionary/entry.cgi?entry=5753&amp;super=2277|title=Coptic Dictionary Online|website=corpling.uis.georgetown.edu|access-date=2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) "[[magic (supernatural)|magic]]".&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;

In fact, the Egyptians believed that all ritual actions achieved their effect through ḥkꜣ.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bleeker|1967|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a fundamental force that rituals were meant to manipulate. Using magic, people, objects, and actions were equated with counterparts in the divine realm and thus were believed to affect events among the gods.&lt;ref name="Ritner 247"&gt;{{harvnb|Ritner|1993|pp=247–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the daily offering, for instance, the cult statue, regardless of which deity it represented, was associated with [[Osiris]], god of the dead. The priest performing the ritual was identified with [[Horus]], the living son of Osiris, who in mythology sustained his father after death through offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmann|2001|pp=49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; By magically equating himself with a god in a myth, the priest was able to interact with the temple deity.&lt;ref name="Ritner 247"/&gt;

===Festivals===
On days of particular religious significance, the daily rituals were replaced with festival observances. Different festivals occurred at different intervals, though most were annual.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spalinger|2001|p=521}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their timing was based on the [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian civil calendar]], which most of the time was far out of step with the astronomical year. Thus, while many festivals had a seasonal origin, their timing lost its connection with the seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spalinger|1998|pp=257–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most festivals took place at a single temple, but others could involve two or more temples or an entire region of Egypt; a few were celebrated throughout the country. In the New Kingdom and later, the festival calendar at a single temple could include dozens of events, so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by the priests.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 95"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those festivals that involved a procession outside the temple, the local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate. These were the most elaborate temple ceremonies, accompanied by the recitation of hymns and the performance of musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sauneron|2000|pp=92–94, 96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SFEC-RAMSES-II-TEMPLE-2009-130 c.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Relief showing rows of men carrying poles that support a model boat|Priests carrying a festival barque in a relief from the Ramesseum]]
Festival ceremonies entailed reenactment of mythological events or the performance of other symbolic acts, like the cutting of a sheaf of wheat during the harvest-related festival dedicated to the god [[Min (god)|Min]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bleeker|1967|pp=25, 40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these ceremonies took place only within the temple building, such as the "union with the sun disk" festival practiced in the Late Period and afterwards, when cult statues were carried to the temple roof at the start of the New Year to be enlivened by the rays of the sun. In festivals that involved a procession, priests carried the divine image out from the sanctuary, usually in its model barque, to visit another site. The barque might travel entirely on land or be loaded onto a real boat to travel on the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Verner|2013|pp=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the god's visit varied. Some were tied to the ideology of kingship. In the [[Opet Festival]], an extremely important ceremony during the New Kingdom, the image of Amun from Karnak visited the form of Amun worshipped at [[Luxor Temple]], and both acted to reaffirm the king's divine rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bell|1997|pp=158, 174–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still other celebrations had a [[ancient Egyptian funerary practices|funerary character]], as in the [[Beautiful Festival of the Valley]], when Amun of Karnak visited the mortuary temples of the [[Theban Necropolis]] to visit the kings commemorated there, while ordinary people visited the funerary chapels of their own deceased relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Teeter|2011|pp=66–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some may have centered on [[hieros gamos|ritual marriages]] between deities, or between deities and their human consorts, although the evidence that ritual marriage was their purpose is ambiguous. A prominent example is a festival in which an image of [[Hathor]] from the [[Dendera Temple complex]] was brought annually to visit the [[Temple of Edfu]], the temple of her mythological consort [[Horus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stadler|2008|pp=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These varied ceremonies were united by the broad purpose of renewing life among the gods and in the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bleeker|1967|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gods involved in a festival also received various offerings in much larger quantities than in daily ceremonies. The enormous amounts of food listed in festival texts are unlikely to have been divided among the priests alone, so it is likely that the celebrating commoners also participated in the reversion of these offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Janssen|1978|pp=513–514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred animals===
[[File:Apis bull on coffin.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of a bull on a platform. The bull has a yellow disk and a pair of feathers between its horns.|The [[Apis (deity)|Apis]]]]
Some temples kept sacred animals, which were believed to be manifestations of the temple god's ''ba'' in the same way that cult images were. Each of these sacred animals was kept in the temple and worshipped for a certain length of time, ranging from a year to the lifetime of the animal. At the end of that time, it was replaced with a new animal of the same species, which was selected by a divine oracle or based on specific markings that were supposed to indicate its sacred nature. Among the most prominent of these animals were the [[Apis (deity)|Apis]], a [[sacred bull]] worshipped as a manifestation of the  [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphite]] god [[Ptah]], and the falcon at Edfu who represented the falcon god Horus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meeks|Favard-Meeks|1996|pp=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Late Period, a different form of worship involving animals developed. In this case, laymen paid the priests to kill, mummify, and bury an animal of a particular species as an offering to a god. These animals were not regarded as especially sacred, but as a species they were associated with the god because it was depicted in the form of that animal. The god [[Thoth]], for instance, could be depicted as an [[ibis]] and as a [[baboon]], and both ibises and baboons were given to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ray|2001|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this practice was distinct from the worship of single divine representatives, some temples kept stocks of animals that could be selected for either purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Dunand and Zivie-Coche, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; These practices produced large cemeteries of mummified animals, such as the catacombs around the [[Serapeum of Saqqara]] where the Apis bulls were buried along with millions of animal offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|Smith|1997|pp=116–120, 123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oracles===
By the beginning of the New Kingdom, and quite possibly earlier, the festival procession had become an opportunity for people to seek [[oracle]]s from the god. Their questions dealt with subjects ranging from the location of a lost object to the best choice for a government appointment. The motions of the barque as it was carried on the bearers' shoulders—making simple gestures to indicate "yes" or "no", tipping toward tablets on which possible answers were written, or moving toward a particular person in the crowd—were taken to [[divination|indicate the god's reply]].&lt;ref name="Kruchten"&gt;{{harvnb|Kruchten|2001|pp=609–611}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Greco-Roman period, and possibly much earlier, oracles were used outside the festival, allowing people to consult them frequently. Priests interpreted the movements of sacred animals or, being asked questions directly, wrote out or spoke answers that they had supposedly received from the god in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frankfurter|1998|pp=148–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The priests' claim to speak for the gods or interpret their messages gave them great political influence and provided the means for the High Priests of Amun to dominate Upper Egypt during the Third Intermediate Period.&lt;ref name="Kruchten"/&gt;

===Popular worship===
Although they were excluded from the formal rituals of the temple, laymen still sought to interact with the gods. There is little evidence of the religious practices of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom or later periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=107, 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary Egyptians used many venues to interact with the divine, such as household shrines or community chapels, the official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration.&lt;ref name="Lesko 337"&gt; {{harvnb|Lesko|2001|pp=337–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Naophorus MAN Napoli Inv1068.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Statue of a kneeling man holding a box containing a small male figure|Votive statue of a man donating a shrine containing a figure of [[Osiris]]]]
Unable to address the cult image directly, laymen still attempted to convey their prayers to it. At times they related messages to priests to deliver to the temple deity; at other times they expressed their piety in the parts of the temple that they could access. Courts, doorways, and hypostyle halls might have spaces designated for public prayer.&lt;ref name="Teeter 77"/&gt; Sometimes people directed their appeals to the royal colossi, which were believed to act as divine intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; More private areas for devotion were located at the building's outer wall, where large niches served as "chapels of the hearing ear" for individuals to speak to the god.&lt;ref name="Teeter 77"/&gt;

The Egyptians also interacted with deities through the donation of offerings, ranging from simple bits of jewelry to large and finely carved statues and stelae.&lt;ref name="Lesko 337"/&gt; Among their contributions were statues that sat in temple courts, serving as memorials to the donors after their deaths and receiving portions of the temple offerings to sustain the donors' spirits. Other statues served as gifts to the temple god, and inscribed stelae conveyed to the resident deity the donors' prayers and messages of thanks. Over the centuries, so many of these statues accumulated within a temple building that priests sometimes moved them out of the way by burying them in caches beneath the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=62–64, 99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commoners offered simple wooden or clay models as votives. The form of these models may indicate the reason for their donation. Figurines of women are among the most common types of votive figures, and some are inscribed with a prayer for a woman to bear a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Teeter|2011|pp=87–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Festival processions offered a chance for laymen to approach and perhaps even glimpse the cult image in its barque, and for them to receive portions of the god's food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the key rituals of any festival still took place within the temple, out of public sight, Egyptologist Anthony Spalinger has questioned whether the processions inspired genuine "religious feelings" or were simply seen as occasions for revelry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spalinger|1998|pp=245, 249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the oracular events during festivals provided an opportunity for people to receive responses from the normally isolated deities, as did the other varieties of oracle that developed late in Egyptian history. Temples eventually became a venue for yet another type of divine contact: dreams. The Egyptians saw dreaming as a means of communion with the divine realm, and by the Ptolemaic period many temples provided buildings for [[incubation (ritual)|ritual incubation]]. People slept in these buildings in hopes of contacting the temple god. The petitioners often sought a magical solution to sickness or infertility, but at other times they simply sought an answer to a question, receiving the answer through a dream rather than an oracle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2004|pp=119–120, 135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After abandonment==
After their original religious activities ceased, Egyptian temples suffered slow decay. Many were defaced by Christians trying to erase the remnants of ancient Egyptian religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baines|1997|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some temple buildings, such as the ''mammisi'' at Dendera or the hypostyle hall at Philae, were [[Christianized sites|adapted into churches]] or other types of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dijkstra|2011|pp=405–406, 427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly the sites were left disused, as at the Temple of [[Khnum]] at [[Elephantine]], while locals carried off their stones to serve as material for new buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dijkstra|2011|pp=420–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dismantling of temples for stone continued well into modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2004|pp=27–29, 179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limestone was especially useful as a source of [[lime (material)|lime]], so temples built of limestone were almost all dismantled. Sandstone temples, found mostly in Upper Egypt, were more likely to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quirke|1997a|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; What humans left intact was still subject to natural weathering. Temples in desert areas could be partly covered by drifts of sand, while those near the Nile, particularly in Lower Egypt, were often buried under layers of river-borne silt. Thus, some major temple sites like Memphis were reduced to ruin, while many temples far from the Nile and centers of population remained mostly intact. With understanding of the hieroglyphic script lost, the information about Egyptian culture that was preserved in the surviving temples lay incomprehensible to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=29, 102, 114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation changed dramatically with the [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria]] in 1798, which brought with it a [[Commission des Sciences et des Arts|corps of scholars]] to examine the surviving ancient monuments. The results of their study inspired a fascination with ancient Egypt throughout Europe. In the early nineteenth century, growing numbers of Europeans traveled to Egypt, both to see the ancient monuments and to collect Egyptian antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2004|pp=55–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many temple artifacts, from small objects to enormous obelisks, were removed by outside governments and private collectors. This wave of [[Egyptomania]] resulted in the rediscovery of temple sites such as Abu Simbel, but artifacts and even whole temples were often treated with great carelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2004|pp=103, 126, 179–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discoveries of the period made possible the [[decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs]] and the beginnings of [[Egyptology]] as a scholarly discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2004|pp=xi, 160–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karnak45.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction work on a pylon at [[Karnak]], from whose interior ''[[talatat]]'' blocks from the [[Amarna Period]] are being retrieved&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 2000 7, 240–242"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=7, 240–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Nineteenth-century Egyptologists studied the temples intensively, but their emphasis was on collection of artifacts to send to their own countries, and their slipshod excavation methods often did further harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2004|pp=177–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slowly the antique-hunting attitude toward Egyptian monuments gave way to careful study and preservation efforts. The government also took greater control of archaeological activity as Egypt's independence from foreign powers increased.

Yet even in recent times the ancient remains have faced threats. The most severe was the construction of the [[Aswan Dam]] in the 1960s, which threatened to submerge the temples in what had been Lower Nubia beneath the newly formed [[Lake Nasser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2004|pp=250–251}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major effort by the [[United Nations]] disassembled some of the threatened monuments and rebuilt them on higher ground, and the Egyptian government gave several of the others, such as the [[Temple of Dendur]], [[Temple of Taffeh]], and [[Temple of Debod]], as gifts to nations that had contributed to the preservation effort. Nevertheless, several other temples vanished beneath the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000|pp=219–220, 230, 242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there are dozens of sites with substantial temple remains,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson|2000}}, Pt. V, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; although many more once existed, and none of the major temples in Lower or [[Middle Egypt]] are well preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baines|1997|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those that are well preserved, such as Karnak, Luxor, and Abu Simbel, draw tourists from around the world and are therefore a key attraction for the [[tourism in Egypt|Egyptian tourist industry]], which is a major sector of the [[economy of Egypt|Egyptian economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Egypt State Information Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three temple sites—Ancient Thebes with its Necropolis, Memphis and its Necropolis, and the Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae—have been designated by [[UNESCO]] as [[List of World Heritage Sites in Egypt|World Heritage Sites]]. The Egyptian government is working to balance the demands of tourism against the need to [[Historic preservation|protect ancient monuments]] from the harmful effects of tourist activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fagan|2004|pp=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] work continues as well, as many temple remains still lie buried and many extant temples are not yet fully studied. Some damaged or destroyed structures, like the temples of Akhenaten, are even being reconstructed. These efforts are improving modern understanding of Egyptian temples, which in turn allow better understanding of ancient Egyptian society as a whole.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 2000 7, 240–242"/&gt;

The  '''flag of Sardinia''', called the '''flag of the Four Moors''' or simply the '''Four Moors''' ({{lang-it|I quattro mori}}; {{lang-sc|Sos battor moros}} in Logudorese or ''Is cuattru morus'' in Campidanese), is the flag of the island of [[Sardinia]] ([[Italy]]), first officially adopted by the [[Regions of Italy#Autonomous regions with special statute|autonomous region]] in 1950 with a revision in 1999, describing it as a "white field with a red cross and a bandaged [[Maure|Moor's head]] facing away from the left (the edge close to the mast) in each quarter" (Regional Law 15 April 1999, n. 10, Article 1.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.regione.sardegna.it/j/v/86?v=9&amp;c=72&amp;s=1&amp;file=1999010&lt;/ref&gt;. It was also the historical flag and coat of arms of the Spanish and later Savoyard [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. 

The flag is composed of the [[St George's Cross]] and four heads of [[Moors]], which in the past were not forehead bandaged but blindfolded and turned towards the left. The most accepted hypothesis is that the heads represented the heads of Moorish princes defeated by the [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]], as for the first time they appeared in the 13th century seals of the Crown of Aragon – although with a beard and no bandage, contrary to the Moors of the Sardinian flag, which appeared for the first time in a manuscript of the second half of the 14th century.

==History==
[[File:Gelre Folio 62r.jpg|thumb|200px|First testimony of the flag of Sardinia. Manuscript of Gelre, second half of the fourteenth century, Folio 62r]]
[[File:Regni di Carlo V.jpg|thumb|200px|Emperor Charles V and the coats of arms of his Italian and iberian kingdoms]]
[[File:Stemma del Regno di Sardegna metà del XVI secolo.JPG|thumb|200px|16th century flag of Sardinia]]
[[File:Apoteosis Heraldica 1681 Museo de Historia de la Ciudad,Barcelona, i 4 mori sardi sono nettamente distinti iconograficamente dai 4 mori d'Aragona.JPG|thumb|200px|Apoteosis Heraldica 1681 Museo de Historia de la Ciudad,Barcelona, The four moors of Sardinia differ from those of Aragon: the former have only the bandage on his forehead, the seconds are crowned and bearded]]
The oldest certified emblem of the four Moors dates back to 1281: it was the seal of the Royal Chancellery of Peter of Aragon, but the four heads had no bandages and were bearded; the coat of arms of Sardinia never appeared in such a way.
After that the kingdom of Sardinia was founded in 1326, it became part of the Crown of Aragon; these seals will come to closing documents of [[James II of Aragon|King James II]] (1326), [[Alfonso IV of Aragon|Alfonso Benigno]] (1327-1336) and [[Peter IV of Aragon|Peter]] I (1336-1387). Some specimens are preserved in the Historical Archive of the city of [[Cagliari]]. The late 14th century [[Gelre Armorial]] attributes the Four Moors to the Kingdom of Sardinia in the states of the [[Crown of Aragon]]. It is found in another Armorial perhaps from Lorraine area (preserved in the National Library of France) and of uncertain date but certainly in the 15th century. In 1509, another Portuguese Armorial Book (Livro do Armeiro-mor). Sardinia is represented only with the cross of St. George.

The Four Moors begin to be used consistently as a symbol of the Kingdom of Sardinia during the time of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], and especially from the time of the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]. 
A book printed by [[Plantin Press|Plantin]], Antwerp, representing the funeral procession of Charles V composed of bishops and harnessed horses with the insignia of each state.

In Sardinia the first safe attestation of the coat of arms is on the cover of the Acts of the military arm of the Sardinian Parliament, the ''Capitols de Cort del Stament Militar de Serdenya'' printed in Cagliari in 1591. 

At this time, now the memories of the long and often fratricidal wars with the Judge of Arborea was ebbing away, the Iberian settlers were now included in the Sardinian society, with the passing of generations, becoming an integral part for inclusion in a political organization in which not only Sardinia, but also Aragon and Catalonia were small components. It meant that the accession at the Imperial Habsburg Ideology, reinvigorate also the sense of belonging to that little State that was represented by the Four Moors. Over the centuries the flag or coat of arms of the four Moors were depicted in various ways: without bandage, with blindfold or forehead, facing to luff or to fly end, or crowned, with no Moors, in reverse, and this according to the mode of the charged artist, such as that under the leadership of [[Diego Velázquez]] and [[Francisco de Zurbaran]] represented in the [[Palacio del Buen Retiro]] in Madrid. Throughout the period of the Iberian monarchies the original design of the bandages on his forehead is respected.

Ever since the [[House of Savoy]] ruled Sardinia in the mid-18th century, instead, the iconography of putting the blindfold over the eyes of the Moors settled and continued to persist until 1999, within the flag of St. George, in every quarter and in the direction of the luff. The Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Sardinia clearly leads the four Moors with the bandage on their foreheads. The blindfold appears in 1800: it was either due to a mistake of a copyist or a deliberate act as a mark of protest against the Mainland rulers.

In 1952, the shield of the blindfolded eyes Four Moors became the official flag of the Autonomous Region and also adorned his banner (Decree of the President of the Republic of 5 July 1952). In 1999, a special regional law changed the flag of the Four Moors from the version adopted under Savoyard rule to the original one, as described in the introduction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.gelocal.it/lanuovasardegna/archivio/lanuovasardegna/1999/04/14/SK104.html ''Sì ai quattro mori sbendati, Il governo approva la nuova bandiera sarda'', La Nuova Sardegna]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legendary origin==
[[File:QUATTRO MORI.jpg|thumb|200px|20th century coat of arms adopted by the [[Brigata Sassari]] the Sardinian soldier brigade during [[World War I]]]]
There are separate Spanish and Sardinian traditions to explain the origin of the flag and there is no consensus among scholars as to which is correct. According to the Spanish tradition, it was a creation of [[Peter I of Aragon and Navarre|King Peter I of Aragon]], celebrating his victory at the [[Battle of Alcoraz]] in 1096. It was said that [[St. George]] miraculously appeared on the field of battle and that there were four severed heads of [[Saracen]] kings at the end; thus the red cross and white background of the [[St George's Cross]] and the heads of four Moors.&lt;ref name="Zurita1668"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerónimo Zurita|title=Anales de la Corona de Aragon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-qyhXbIEF64C&amp;pg=PP5|accessdate=28 March 2013|year=1668|publisher=Dormer|at=p.32 paragraph XCVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sardinian-[[Pisa]]n tradition attributes the arms to a banner given by [[Pope Benedict VIII]] to the Pisans in aid of the [[Sardinians]] in a conflict with the Saracens of Musetto who were trying to conquer the Italian peninsula and Sardinia. This flag however has inverted colours and no heads on it.&lt;ref&gt;Ranieri Sardo, Cronaca di Pisa, (Manuscript Magliabecchi XXV-491, 1440-1450) a cura di Ottavio Banti, Istituto Italiano per il medioevo, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Kingdom of Sardinia was founded, the rulers of the island were known as archons (ἄρχοντες in Greek) or judges (''iudices'' in Latin, ''judikes'' in Sardinian, ''giudici'' in Italian). The island was organized into one "judicatus" from the 9th century on (see [[List of monarchs of Sardinia]]). After the Muslim conquest of Sicily in the 9th century, the Byzantines, who previously ruled Sardinia, couldn't manage to defend their far west province. Probably, a local noble family acceded to power, still identifying themselves as vassal of the Byzantines, but independent "de facto", as communications with Constantinople were very difficult. At the beginnings of the 11th century an attempt to conquer the island was made by Spanish Muslims. We have very little record of that war, only by Pisa and Genoa chronicles. Christians won, but after that, the previous Sardinian kingdom was totally undermined and divided into four more little judicati: Cagliari, Arborea, Gallura, and Torres or Logudoro; each one developed its own coat of arms. When, with the appointment of the King of Aragon as King of Sardinia, the island again became one united kingdom, only the Judicatus of Arborea survived, and fought for a century against the Kingdom of Sardinia for supremacy.

According to some, the flag derives from Alcoraz victory of 1096, is linked to the Crown of Aragon, and represents the [[Spanish Reconquista]] against the Moors who occupied most of the Iberian Peninsula. It is composed of the cross of St. George, also a symbol of the Crusaders fighting in the same time in the Holy Land, and the four severed heads, representing four major victories in Spain by the Aragonese: the reconquest of Zaragoza, Valencia, Murcia, and the Balearic Islands. According to others (Mario Valdes y Cocom),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/secret/famous/ssecretum1.html&lt;/ref&gt; the Moors represent the Egyptian [[Saint Maurice]], martyred under [[Diocletian]], and are shown in this manner, with the heads bandaged, in countless coats of arms in the Franco-German area. Even [[Saint Victor of Marseilles]], who was from the same Theban Legion commanded by Maurice and escaped the decimation, is represented by a blackamoor with a bandage on his forehead, as in the High Altar of [[St. Nicholas' Church of Tallinn]],&lt;ref&gt;Estonia, oil on wood, St. George, St. Nicholas and St. Victor of Marseilles, 1481 by Rode, Hermen (c.1468-1504)&lt;/ref&gt; now in the Art Museum of Estonia, Tallinn. The common tradition which links the stories of the two saints suggests that the symbol was designed between the [[St. Maurice's Abbey|St. Maurice Abbey]] [[Valais|Canton of Valais]] (Switzerland) and the [[Abbey of Saint Victor, Marseille|Abbey of St. Victor in Marseilles]]; each was built in the place of martyrdom of the respective saint. Between 1112 and 1166 the [[County of Provence]] was under the direct control of the kings of Aragon, and until 1245 ruled by descendants of the same dynasty. It should also be noted that the abbey of St. Victor of Marseilles had extensive property and political influence in Sardinia, especially in the [[Giudicato of Cagliari|Judicatus (kingdom) of Cagliari]], from the 11th to the 13th century. Actually, there are [[hagiography]]ies of many "Saint Victor" related to the [[Theban Legion]], as [[Viktor of Xanten]] or [[Victor of Solothurn]] and to the persecutions of [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximinus II]] as [[Victor Maurus]] of [[Milan]], [[Vincent, Orontius, and Victor|Victor]] of [[Puigcerdà]], [[Spain]], probably inspired by the same martyr. 

However, the four Moors became the symbol of the Kingdom of Sardinia at its foundation, with the Corsican flag dating back to the same era, and became in time the flag of the island and its people. In any case, the meaning of the symbols, either two holy warriors or Moor heads cut off, makes it an emblem of warring Christianity, ''[[crusade]]r'' in the broad sense of the term, originated in a historical period of bitter conflict between Islam and Christianity, in which Sardinia was fully involved.

==Modern use==
[[File:Sardegna-Stemma.svg|thumb|200px|Coat of arms of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia, with eye-blinded bendage]]
The [[Sardinian Action Party]] was founded in 1921, and adopted the four Moors as its symbol. It is conceivable that it had historically been interpreted as the icon of the four judges, as argued by Antonio Era, professor at the [[University of Sassari]] and the Regional Council, on 19 June 1950 in the discussion of the regional council before the vote that would declare the Four Moors to be the official flag of Sardinia. Era criticized the banner, stating:

{{bquote|Mind that the emblem of the Four Moors is not, as they say, the four judges in which Sardinia was divided nine centuries ago, when it was free and independent: it is an error of historical interpretation, and therefore it is not obvious nor indispensable to choose just that emblem. That is, yes, a popular coat of arms and consecrates the centuries-old tradition of Sardinia, as mentioned in the agenda, but it is not a ''very Sardinian'' emblem as it is usually imagined.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Era, Address to the Regional Council, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This speech denounced the fact that the flag was not of Sardinian origin, but it is also documentary evidence of popular feeling that he read it in the medieval Giudicati history. On the other side, the history of the Giudicati developed mainly after the victory of the maritime republics against the Saracens, which allowed the development of the four little kingdoms and the coincidence was perfectly expressed by the four Moors.

Out of the [[Sardinian nationalism|many separatist]] parties active on the island, a minor Sardist party (IRS) does not recognize the flag as being historically representative of Sardinia and its people, due to its origin dating back to Aragonese rule. Such party prefers to use the eradicated tree flag, the coat of arms of the judge of Arborea, considered the last autochthonous Sardinian state, as the party's flag. However, the eradicated tree is also the Aragonese emblem of Sobrarbe and, despite no in-depth studies, could also originate as part of the Aragonese conquest.

== Early life ==

Frank Walter was born in [[Antigua]] in 1926.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.contemporaryartdaily.com|title=Contemporary Art Daily|website=www.contemporaryartdaily.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the Antigua Grammar School where he excelled in Latin, science, and the arts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Walter was raised by elderly family matriarchs and learned from a young age that his ancestors included both aristocratic European slave owners and enslaved people of African descent. During Walter's youth, Antigua was a society divided along racial lines, and the reality of mixed-race families created outside of marriage was largely considered private knowledge and often lost through the generations.

In his youth, Walter's education and professional trajectory defied the statistical challenges facing young men of color in 1930s Antigua, and the identity that he constructed was heavily influenced by his awareness of his aristocratic European forebears.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artfixdaily.com/artwire/release/6064-remarkable-works-of-self-taught-artist-revealed-in-frank-walter-l|title=Remarkable Works of Self-Taught Artist Revealed in 'Frank Walter: Lonely Bird' at Hirschl &amp; Adler Modern|last=Parker|first=Thomas B.|date=January 12, 2016|website=ArtfixDaily|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, Walter became tormented by his descent from white slave owners, enslaved women, and illegitimate mixed-race children.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==  Agricultural career in Antigua ==
Walter was the first person of color to "break through the race barrier to work in the upper tier of Antigua’s agricultural industry". When he was promoted to the role of manager in 1948 at age twenty-two by Sir Alexander Moody-Stuart, Walter became the first to work as an equal among whites in the Antiguan Sugar Syndicate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sugar was the source of socio-economic power at that point in Antigua's history, and Walter's capabilities earned him the respect of his peers.

== Life in Europe ==

Walter was offered the chance to manage the entire Antiguan Sugar Syndicate in the early 1950s, but he turned down this opportunity to embark on an industrial Grand Tour of Great Britain and Europe. He was driven to help alleviate the poverty of his fellow black countrymen and wanted to introduce the latest technological advancements in mining and agriculture to Antigua.

Walter spent eight years traveling Europe and struggling with a race-based caste system that relegated him to unskilled labor. He suffered greatly from the racism he encountered and the poverty that resulted from his low wages, but he continued to pursue his interests by studying in Europe's metropolitan libraries. During this time, he actively researched his family history and studied various aristocratic family trees. He became obsessed with his heritage and also invented connections to the regents of Britain and Europe—crowning himself as the 7th Prince of the West Indies, Lord of Follies and the Ding-a-Ding Nook.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The complexities of Walter's mixed-race identity and his frustrations with postcolonial society became increasingly apparent during his eight years in Europe.

== Life in Dominica ==
When Walter arrived in Antigua in 1961, the sugar industry was on the brink of collapse. He relocated to the nearby island of [[Dominica]], and applied for and received a land grant from the government. He named his twenty-five-acre agricultural estate Mount Olympus and spent five years clearing the land by hand to create a sustainable and productive acreage. He selectively removed the canopy of bois diable trees to allow sunlight and air for fruit trees and vegetables. Using kilns, he repurposed these cleared materials as charcoal to make a viable local energy source he shared with his neighbors.

During this time, Walter began to sculpt figures using wood harvested from his estate in a style that was likely inspired by the traditions of the Caribbean Arawak and African Dogon peoples.

Once Mount Olympus was prepared for planting, the government confiscated it from Walter. He was bereft at his loss and returned to Antigua.

== Seclusion in Antigua ==
In the late 1960s, Walter ran and was defeated in Antigua's race for prime minister. He chose to retire from public life and dedicate himself to his art practice.

Walter built a simple house and art studio on Bailey's Hill above Falmouth Harbour where he lived in isolation without running water or electricity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His home was filled with paintings and sculpture he made in secrecy and carefully stacked and arranged in his house. He was also surrounded by stacks of books on philosophy, law, history, botany, and heraldry. Walter's creative process relied on a multidisciplinary approach and a collection of curio to generate what Walter Benjamin identified in his 1931 essay “Unpacking My Library” as a “dialectical tension between the poles of order and disorder.”

Walter's sculptures served a talismanic purpose in his life, and he depicted figures as varied as ancient [[Arawak]] people, European royalty, and men from outer space. He revisited his memories in remarkable detail in painting and writing and explored nature as an avid environmentalist and student of science. Many portraits and landscapes drew upon his memories of travel in [[Scotland]] and [[Europe]], and he classified his broad range of paintings as galactic, scientific, heraldic, and abstract.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.outsiderartfair.com/artist/2157|title=Outsider Art Fair|website=Outsider Art Fair|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic legacy ==
Walter was a prolific artist. He produced:
* 5,000 paintings
* 1,000 photographs
* 600 hand-carved wooden sculptures
* 2,000 carved wooden picture frames
* 500 handmade wooden toys
* 25,000+ typewritten pages on history, philosophy, poetry, plays, political science, genealogy, and art&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* 25,000 hand-written pages on history, philosophy, poetry, plays, political science, genealogy, and art&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* 440+ hours of tapes in Walter's words

In Frank Walter: The Last Universal Man (Radius Books, 2017), author and curator Barbara Paca posits that the sheer diversity and depth of Walter's work as visual artist, musician, and philosopher means he attained the humanist ideal of man exemplified in Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man (c.1490).

Walter's struggle with his mental health gave him a unique perspective and can be seen as an inextricable part of his creativity and invention. For this reason, comparisons have been made between Frank Walter and mathematician John Nash, who was featured in the 1998 novel A Beautiful Mind by Sylvia Nasar and the 2001 film of the same name directed by Ron Howard&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-unknown-antiguan-visionary-knew-the-living-artist|title=The Unknown Antiguan Visionary Who Knew He Was "the Most Important Living Artist"|last=Indrisek|first=Scott|date=2017-05-11|work=Artsy|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter's practice has been linked to a diverse group of artists, including Adolf Wölfli (1864–1930), Alfred Wallis (1855–1942), Forrest Bess (1911–1977), and Henry Darger (1892–1973). These artists—whose art is often categorized as “outsider art”—lived a reclusive lifestyle beyond the mainstream and explored unconventional, fantastic, and deeply personal ideas.

There are few Caribbean parallels to Walter. Guyanese painter Aubrey Williams (1926–1990) is perhaps the closest biographically. They were both highly educated and enjoyed early careers as successful tropical plantation managers. They had a British colonial heritage and traveled in the early 1950s to England, where they encountered overt racism. For example, Pablo Picasso reduced Williams to his physical appearance when they met. The famous artist told him that he had a “fine head,” and that he would like to paint him one day.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://radiusbooks.org/books/frank-walter-the-last-universal-man-1926-2009/|title=Frank Walter: The Last Universal Man, 1926-2009 {{!}} Radius Books|last=Paca|first=Barbara|date=2017|website=radiusbooks.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to New York Times critic Jason Farago, Walter's paintings of Antiguan flora—the insignia of European nobility—and his small abstractions of stars and circles recall the Pop Art of Robert Indiana&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/arts/design/venice-notebook-a-feast-at-the-biennale-and-beyond.html|title=Venice Notebook: Samplers From a Biennale Banquet|last=Farago|first=Jason|date=2017-05-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7064">'''Francois Dufrene''' ('''François Dufrêne''') (born Paris, September 21, 1930 - died Paris, December 12, 1982) was a French [[Nouveau réalisme|Nouveau realist]] visual artist, [[Lettrist]] and [[Ultra-Lettrist]] [[poet]]. He is primarily known as a pioneer in [[sound poetry]] and for his use of [[décollage]] within [[Nouveau réalisme]].

==Lettrist, Ultra-Lettrist and Nouveau réalisme movements==
Dufrene, along with [[Gil J Wolman]] and [[Brion Gysin]], was one of the stalwarts of the experimental [[poetry]] in France. Dufrene's abstract poetry has led many to regard him as a member of the first generation [[Sound poetry|sound poets]] - following in the footsteps of [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], [[Richard Huelsenbeck]], [[Hugo Ball]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Kurt Schwitters]] and [[Antonin Artaud]] (among others).

Francois Dufrene joined [[Isidore Isou]] and the [[Lettrisme|Lettrist movement]] in 1946 and continued to participate until 1964. Dufrene's talent was evident in the fact that he was already a member of the [[Lettrist]] Group at only 16 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dufrene.net/] François Dufrene bio&lt;/ref&gt;

Dufrene then created a [[phonetic]] poetry which breaks the structures of language he called [[Ultra-Lettrist]]. The Ultra-Lettrist movement was an art form developed by Dufrene along with Jean-Louis Brau and [[Gil J Wolman]] in the 1950s, when they split from Isidore Isou's Lettrism. Dufrene explored vocal possibilities of [[concrete music]], a form of expression based on spontaneity directly recorded to tape, exploiting the [[noise music]] of sound, meaning and [[nonsense]].

Dufrene became friends with [[Yves Klein]] in 1950 and with [[Raymond Hains]] and [[Jacques Villeglé]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dufrene.net/] François Dufrene bio&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957 he discovered décollage and in 1960 - with [[Pierre Restany]], [[Yves Klein]], [[Jean Tinguely]], [[Arman]], Hains and Villeglé - and helped found the art group known as [[Nouveau réalisme]]. He is considered one of the important artists in that [[Neo-Dada]] art movement.

==Crirythme performances==
Dufrene earned fame for his performances called ''Crirythmes'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://ubumexico.centro.org.mx/sound/poesia_sonora/Poesia-Sonora_11_Francois-Dufrene.mp3] audio file of ''Crirythme'' on [[Ubuweb]]&lt;/ref&gt; which was in a vocal style of [[sound art]] different from those of his contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-contemporain.eu.org/base/chronologie/1223.html] Main exhibitions&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Crirythme'' work inspired generations of experimental poets, such as [[Henri Chopin]], [[Bernard Heidsieck]], [[Ake Hodell]], [[Charles Amirkhanian]], [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Gregory Whitehead]], [[bpNichol]], [[Tracie Morris]], [[Clive Fencott]], [[Ada Verdun Howell]], [[Mitch Corber]] and [[Jaap Blonk]].

==Film without a screen==
Dufrene is the author of a film called ''Tambours du jugement premier'' (''Drums of the first judgment'') (1952), a fantasy film presented on the sidelines of the Cannes Film Festival the same year. In 1973 it was presented at the Atelier de Création (France Culture), in 1981 as part of the exhibition ''Paris-Paris'' at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]], and in 1982 at ''Thirty Years of Experimental Cinema in France'' also at the Centre Georges Pompidou.

''Tambours du jugement premier'' is a "film" without screen, projector or film, which eliminates not only the dictatorship of the image over the word, but abandons the projected image altogether, because it’s no longer a matter of perceiving it passively, but rather one of imagining or recreating it. Originally however, Dufrene had indeed anticipated a visual part of the film, never taken to fruition, which was not even complete when the [[Screenplay|script]] was published. The weight of the work lay clearly in its [[soundtrack]], which is all that the initial project finally became. It could therefore be considered a piece of [[sound art]] rather than a [[film]] in the conventional sense.

The first presentation of ''Tambours du jugement premier'' as an ''imaginary film without screen or film'' took place in [[Cannes]] in 1952, at the Alexandre III cinema. The scant resources it required enabled the imaginary film to be improvised. The voices were situated in the four corners of the hall and while the performers recited the texts, the house lights flashed on and off and the [[stage curtain]] opened and closed repeatedly. Dufrene’s ''Tambours du jugement premier'' is a play on the exhaustion of [[cinematographic]] medium, situating itself as a film beyond [[Movie projector|film projection]] machinery. The frustration of the public’s expectations - and its invitation to the viewer’s imagination - is what creates a rupture and liberation from the impositions of the standard image.

The soundtrack for ''Tambours du jugement premier'' contains an important phonetic work which includes almost all of the compositions and scores that Dufrene had produced up to that time in the form of lettrist poems and sung aphorisms as experimental [[sound poetry]]. The compositions renounced any type of discursive content and consisted in improvisations recorded on a [[tape recorder]], employing all the possible capabilities of voice and body.

'''''Insignificance'''''  is a 1985 British [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Nicolas Roeg]], produced by [[Jeremy Thomas]] and [[Alexander Stuart (The War Zone)|Alexander Stuart]], and adapted by [[Terry Johnson (dramatist)|Terry Johnson]] from his play of the same name. The film is set in 1954, with most of the action taking place in a hotel room in New York City. The action revolves around the interplay of four characters who represent iconic figures of the era - [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Joseph McCarthy]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], and [[Albert Einstein]] - called The Actress, The Senator, The Ballplayer, and The Professor, respectively.

==Plot==
The film opens on a crowded New York City street where people have gathered to watch a film crew shoot a sequence which becomes recognisable as the iconic shot of Marilyn Monroe in a white dress standing on a grate while the rush of wind caused by a huge fan to imitate the subway going by below blows her skirt up around her waist. The Actress' husband, The Ballplayer, watches with obvious discomfort as she is ogled. The Actress, rather than join him afterwards, disappears in a taxi, leaving him behind. She stops at a store and picks up a variety of toys, flashlights, and balloons.

The Professor, recognisable as Albert Einstein, is in his hotel room, working on pages of mathematical calculations. He is interrupted by The Senator, who has come to alternately coax and threaten him into appearing before a committee to investigate his activities and answer the famous question, "Are you now or have you ever been...?" The Senator is recognisable as Joe McCarthy. The Professor refuses and says he will never appear. The Senator leaves, saying he'll be back to get him at 8 a.m. the following morning.

The Actress appears at the door of the Professor's hotel room, and he invites her in. They talk about fame, being chased, and the stars. She does a lively demonstration of the Theory of Relativity using the toys and flashlights and balloons. She tells The Professor he is at the top of her list of people she'd like to sleep with. They decide to go to bed, but are interrupted by the arrival of The Ballplayer, who has tracked her to the hotel. The Professor leaves them alone and goes to find another room, meeting a Cherokee elevator man with whom he speaks. The Actress and The Ballplayer talk about their marriage; The Actress tells her husband she believes she is pregnant, but he has fallen asleep.

The following morning The Senator arrives at The Professor's room to find him gone, but The Actress naked and alone in his bed. The Senator mistakes her for a call girl and threatens to use her to expose and embarrass The Professor, then punches her hard in the abdomen, causing her to collapse in pain. The Professor returns while The Senator is collecting all of the hundreds of pages of The Professor's work to take away with him. The Professor grabs the papers and throws them out of the windows, while The Actress writhes in agony on the bed. The Senator leaves, defeated in his purpose. The Ballplayer returns and talks about his fame in the baseball world, and confides in him about his marital problems while The Actress is in the bathroom, possibly suffering a miscarriage. She finally announces to him that their marriage is over, and he leaves.

The Actress becomes impatient with The Professor, sensing that he is hiding something. He is sitting on the bed with his watch, which has stopped at 8.15, in one hand, and the alarm clock in the other as the hour approaches 8.15 (the time that "[[Little Boy]]" was dropped on [[Hiroshima]]). He confesses his terrible feelings of guilt about the event, and she reassures him. Right at 8.15 a.m. as she is leaving, he has a vision of the destruction of the room, Hiroshima, and the world. The Actress's skirt swirls in flames as she burns in his vision. Then the film reverses and the world is restored to order as she smiles and leaves.&lt;ref name="La times Insignificance"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Second Look: 'Insignificance'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/26/entertainment/la-ca-second-look-20110626|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=8 August 2013|author=Dennis Lim|date=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''Insignificance'' was originally a play, written by Terry Johnson and performed at the Royal Court in 1982, with [[Judy Davis]] as The Actress. The seed for Johnson's play was his having read that an autographed photograph of Einstein was found amongst Marilyn Monroe's possessions upon her death. The idea of them meeting piqued his interest, and he wrote what became a meditation on the nature of fame.&lt;ref&gt;Sinyard, Neil; ''The Films of Nicolas Roeg''; 1991 Charles Letts &amp; Co.; pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; "It was always meant to be a play about the era, about fame...what these people stood for, the fact that this was different from what they are." He was interested in exploring the differences between who these people really were, as opposed to what qualities others assumed or imbued them with. Johnson acknowledges that there are "lots of little cheats" in the play, mostly to do with exactly where and when ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' was filmed, and the timing of Marilyn's marriage to Joe DiMaggio. Einstein was also never called to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], "but," he said, "had it gone on longer, I can see that as having been a big possibility. He was there in spirit, as it were."&lt;ref name="Monthly Film Bulletin p. 237"&gt;Monthly Film Bulletin; "Relatively Speaking"; August 1985; p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Roeg saw the play and felt it "might be a tool to use. An incident came up in my own life and I thought, 'Good God, nobody knows a damn thing about anyone.' That was the premise that started me thinking about the piece again." Roeg notes that ''Insignificance'' is usually talked about as a meeting between Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein, but what moved him was the pain of the problems between The Actress and The Ballplayer, who are married but seem to know nothing about each other.&lt;ref name="Monthly Film Bulletin p. 237"/&gt; ''Insignificance'' would become his first film adapted from a play.

Roeg asked Johnson to work on the screenplay, which at first meant simply reducing the play to approximately 90 minutes as opposed to two hours, but then Roeg began making suggestions which would expand the screenplay and include flashbacks to the characters' histories, and flash-forwards of imagination. His suggestions inspired Johnson to focus on a deeper development of the characters, while Roeg himself began to imagine how the film could open the play spatially as well as laterally.&lt;ref&gt;Sinyard, Neil; ''The Films of Nicolas Roeg''; 1991 Charles Letts &amp; Co.; pp. 97&lt;/ref&gt;  "He opened it backwards," Johnson said.&lt;ref name="Monthly Film Bulletin p. 237"/&gt;

==Production==
All of the interiors for ''Insignificance'' were shot at Lee Studios in Wembley, with exteriors shot in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089343/combined IMDB Locations Notes&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mise-en-scène]] was created through the use of [[Pablo Picasso]]'s post-cubism painting "Woman and Child on the Seashore" which underscores The Actress' pain about her childlessness,&lt;ref&gt;Criterion Collection Interview with Nicolas Roeg and Terry Johnson, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; while the fractured structure of the narrative was mirrored in the splintered image of Theresa Russell used as a nude calendar shot of The Actress. Created by photographer-collagist [[David Hockney]], the image is, according to film critic Chuck Stephens, "a pinup in a hundred pieces, a centerfold sent through a centrifuge..." and is a reflection of The Actress. With "her much-exposed and famously exploited psyche already splintered into jagged, mingled shards of kittenish innocence, movie business cunning, overwhelming erotic appeal, and abject inner terror, Monroe was post-cubism's quintessential glittering star...perfectly pieced together and seen prismatically all at once..."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Essay in Criterion Collection DVD/Blu-ray release, August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The image is also a metaphor for Roeg's non-linear filmmaking, Stephens notes that "for a cine-cubist like Roeg, two entirely disparate spatial and temporal dimensions are never more than a splice apart, and in ''Insignificance'', the past is always present, and never goes away."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
''Insignificance'' received mostly positive reviews at the time of its release, and currently has a 67% score at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/insignificance/ Rotten Tomatoes Score&lt;/ref&gt; The film has been written about extensively in the years since it was first seen. [[Film4]]'s movie critic wrote: "Roeg really is the perfect director to bring Johnson's stage play to the screen. Throughout, tortured childhood flashbacks and pessimistic flash-forwards (ka-boom!) draw unexpected connections between time, place and circumstance, with the repeated visual motif of a wristwatch employed to mark time's passing — but perhaps also to suggest all time is one time; each moment co-existing. As evinced by his back catalogue, it's something of a hobbyhorse for a director enchanted with the notion of [[synchronicity]] – see ''[[Don't Look Now]]'' in particular. Here, 1920 bleeds into 1945 and drip-feeds into the 1980s, a period in which another 'Actor' has taken on his greatest role as the President of the United States."

Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat write: "''Insignificance'' shines with some incandescent moments of acting bravado delivered by Theresa Russell, Tony Curtis, and Gary Busey. As a weird meditation on sex, power, knowledge, and fame, this is a four-star treat for those who savor exotic movie fare...Nicolas Roeg (''Don't Look Now'', ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth (film)|The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'') draws out the inner psychological nuances of the drama and delivers the philosophical freight in Terry Johnson's screenplay."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/films/films.php?id=8918 Brussat review&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The film was entered into the [[1985 Cannes Film Festival]] where it was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] and won the Technical Grand Prize.&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/944/year/1985.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Insignificance |accessdate=28 June 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to the film was released on the British label [[ZTT Records]]. It featured a diverse selection of professional artists and composers including movie composer [[Hans Zimmer]], [[Glenn Gregory]], [[Claudia Brücken]], [[Stanley Myers]], [[Midge Ure]] (occasional guitar), [[Roy Orbison]]. In addition, [[Gil Evans]] and his orchestra contributed with an interpretation of Mozart's ''[[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|Jupiter Symphony]]'', and  "America" by Death Comet Crew was also included.

==In popular culture==
The title of the film was used by musician [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]] for his album ''[[Insignificance (Jim O'Rourke album)|Insignificance]]''.

The film is also featured in [[Big Audio Dynamite]]'s music video for "E=MC2" as clips are shown throughout the video and are also referenced throughout the song.

==Home media==
''Insignificance'' was released on VHS in 1985, on Laserdisc a few years later, and on DVD in 2003. In June 2011, the [[Criterion Collection]] released a fully restored and re-mastered DVD and Blu-ray edition, containing interviews with Nicolas Roeg, Terry Johnson, long-time Roeg editor Tony Lawson, and the short film, "Making 'Insignificance'". The release also contains a booklet with excerpts from the August 1985 Roeg-Johnson interview called "Relatively Speaking" in the 1985 Monthly Film Bulletin, and an essay by film critic Chuck Stephens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insignificance|url=http://www.criterion.com/films/27618-insignificance|publisher=The Criterion Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unrelated to [[Japan Photographic Society (19th century)|an earlier organization with the same name]], the JPS grew out of the {{Nihongo|Shiseido Junior Photo Circle|シセイドウ・フォト・ジュニオル・サークル|Shiseidō Foto Junioru Sākuru}}&lt;!-- Yes, all in katakana --&gt; and the Kōga-kai (光画会&lt;ref&gt;In the orthography of the time, 光畫會&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;The account of the early days derives from Iizawa, pp.&amp;nbsp;19&amp;ndash;20, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1924, its first president was [[Shinzō Fukuhara]], and its other founding members included the amateur photographers [[Rosō Fukuhara]], [[Kiichirō Ishida]], [[Isao Kakefuda]], [[Maroni Kumazawa]], [[Yasutarō Mori]], [[Masajirō Sakai]], [[Hekisui Yamanaka]], and [[Jiichirō Yasukōchi]]. Among the members who joined soon after was [[Yasuzō Nojima]], in 1926.

From 1925, the JPS has held a joint exhibition once a year. 

The JPS was suspended in 1944, but restarted in 1946.

'''Ludolf Bakhuizen'''&lt;ref&gt;Name also spelled Ludolf Backhuijzen, Ludolf Backhuizen, Ludolph Backhuyzen, Ludolph Backhuysen, 
Ludolf Bakhuysen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/artists/3414 Ludolf Bakhuizen] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; (28 December 1630&amp;nbsp;– 17 November 1708) was a German-born [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] painter, draughtsman, calligrapher and printmaker.&lt;ref name=oz&gt;{{harvnb|Broos|2017}} &lt;/ref&gt; He was the leading Dutch painter of maritime subjects after [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]] and Younger left for England in 1672.  He also painted portraits of his family and circle of friends.&lt;ref name=oz/&gt;

{{anchor|Biography|History}}

==Life==
He was born in [[Emden]], [[East Frisia]], and came to [[Amsterdam]] in about 1650, working as a merchant's clerk and a [[calligrapher]].{{sfn|Houbraken|1718}} He discovered so strong a genius for painting that he relinquished the business and devoted himself to art from the late 1650s, initially in pen drawings. He studied first under [[Allart van Everdingen]] and then under [[Hendrik Dubbels]], two eminent masters of the time, and soon became celebrated for his sea-pieces, which often had rough seas.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=135}}

He was an ardent student of nature, and frequently exposed himself on the sea in an open boat in order to study the effects of storms. His compositions, which are numerous, are nearly all variations of one subject, the sea, and in a style peculiarly his own, marked by intense realism or faithful imitation of nature. In his later years Bakhuizen employed his skills in [[etching]]; he also painted a few examples each of several other genres of painting, such as portraits, landscapes and [[genre painting]]s.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=135}}

During his life Bakhuizen was visited by [[Cosimo III de' Medici]], [[Peter the Great]] and also worked for various German princes.  In 1699 he opened a gallery on the top floor of the famous [[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|Amsterdam townhall]]. After a visit to England he died in Amsterdam on 17 November 1708.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=135}}

Bakhuizen painted portraits of his large circle of friends. These are of lesser artistic value but provide an insight into his good relations with contemporary scholars and literary figures.&lt;ref name=oz/&gt;

The '''Madonna of Zahražany''' is a sculpture of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and the [[Infant Jesus]] which comes from the former convent of the [[Sisters of the Magdalene Order]] in [[Most-Zahražany]] (1281-1442). It was created before 1380 and is on permanent display at the [[National Gallery in Prague]]
[[File:Madona ze Zahražan, Národní galerie v Praze.jpg|thumb|''Madonna of Zahražany'', [[National Gallery in Prague]]]]
== Description and context ==
The 84&amp;nbsp;cm tall sculpture is made of lime wood, with traces of the original polychromy. The strikingly S-shaped figure of the Madonna holds the [[Christ Child|Infant Jesus]] in her right arm. Putting his finger to his lips, [[Jesus]] symbolises the nuns’ vow of silence. The [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary’s]] garments fit closely around her body, accentuating its natural movement and, on the right-hand side, compositionally balancing the figure of the child. The drapery is elaborated into an intricate system of folds and combines transverse deep hollows and the complex pleating of the merging bottom edges of her clothes. The use of perspectival shortening and the downward views of both Mary and the Infant Jesus indicate that the sculpture was originally located on a high console or in the uppermost part of an altar.

The Madonna of Zahražany is related to several wooden ''Enthroned Madonnas'' of the 1370s (such as those from Hrádek and Konopiště) and also to the stone sculpture of the "Madonna of the Old Town Hall" in Prague (1380) and the triforium bust of [[Blanche of Valois]] that were made by the [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] workshop. A figural type that corresponds with the Madonna of Zahražany appears in book painting ("The Gospel Book of Jan of Opava", 1368).&lt;ref&gt;Kutal A, 1970 p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The compositional scheme has a forerunner in the "[[Liber Viaticus]]" (1354–64) and is repeated in a number of murals ([[Karlštejn]], the [[Emmaus monastery]]) as well as in the figure of St Catherine in a panel painting from the [[Vyšší Brod Monastery|Cistercian monastery in Vyšší Brod]] (''Madonna between St Catherine and St Margaret'', c. 1360).&lt;ref&gt;Mudra A, 2004, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt;

The Madonna of Zahražany is exceptional high-quality and stylistically well-defined carving that, in the context of Central European sculpture of the third quarter of the 14th century, has no parallel in other workshop pieces. It represents an important stage of development and a stylistic shift in Bohemian [[Gothic sculpture]] from the [[Madonna of Michle]] towards the Madonnas of the [[International Gothic]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Mudra A, 2004, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;

Father '''Magnus J. Wenninger''' [[Order of Saint Benedict|OSB]] (October 31, 1919&lt;ref name=Banchoff&gt;Banchoff (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;– February 17, 2017) was an American mathematician who worked on constructing [[polyhedron model]]s, and wrote the first book on their construction.&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born to [[German people|German]] immigrants in Park Falls, Wisconsin, Joseph Wenninger always knew he was going to be a priest.  From an early age, it was understood that his brother Heinie would take after their father and become a baker, and that Joe, as he was then known, would go into the priesthood.&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

When Wenninger was thirteen, after graduating from the parochial school in Park Falls, Wisconsin, his parents saw an advertisement in the German newspaper ''Der Wanderer'' that would help to shape the rest of his life.  The ad was for a preparatory school in [[Collegeville, Minnesota]], associated with the Benedictine [[College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University|St. John’s University]].&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

While admitting to feeling homesick at first, Wenninger quickly made friends and, after a year, knew that this was where he needed to be.  He was a student in a section of the prep school that functioned as a "minor seminary" – later moving on into St. John’s where he studied philosophy and theology, which led into the priesthood.&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Order_in_chaos_Magnus_Wenninger.jpg|thumb|An artistic model created by Father Wenninger called ''Order in Chaos'', representing a chiral subset of triangles of a 16-frequency icosahedral [[geodesic sphere]]]]
When Fr. Wenninger became a [[Benedictine monk]], he took on his monastic name Magnus, meaning "Great".  At the start of his career, Wenninger did not set out on a path one might expect would lead to his becoming the great polyhedronist that he is known as today. Rather, a few chance happenings and seemingly minor decisions shaped a course for Wenninger that led to his groundbreaking studies.&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

Shortly after becoming a priest, Wenninger’s Abbot informed him that their order was starting up a school in the Bahamas.  It was decided that Wenninger would be assigned to teach at that school.  In order to do this, it was necessary that he get a master's degree. Wenninger was sent to the [[University of Ottawa]], in Canada, to study educational psychology. There he studied symbolic logic under Thomas Greenwood of the philosophy department. His thesis title was "The Concept of Number According to Roger Bacon and Albert the Great".&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

After completing his degree, Wenninger went to the school in the Bahamas, where he was asked by the headmaster to choose between teaching English or math. Wenninger chose math, since it seemed to be more in line with the topic of his MA thesis. However, not having taken many math courses in college, Wenninger admits to being able to teach by staying a few pages ahead of the students. He taught Algebra, Euclidean Geometry, Trigonometry and Analytic Geometry.&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

After ten years of teaching, Wenninger felt he was becoming a bit stale.  At the suggestion of his headmaster, Wenninger attended the Columbia Teachers College in summer sessions over a four-year period in the late fifties. It was here that his interest in the "New Math" was formed and his studies of the polyhedra began.&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

Wenninger died at the age of 97, at St John's Abbey on Friday, February 17, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170222111836/http://www.saintjohnsabbey.org/news/obituary-fr-magnus-wenninger-osb/ Obituary for Fr. Magnus Wenninger, OSB] Monk of Saint John's Abbey Collegeville, Minnesota&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sctimes.com/story/news/local/2017/02/20/benedictine-monk-known-his-math-contributions-dies/98161484/ Benedictine monk known for his math contributions dies] Saint Cloud Times, Feb. 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Wenninger’s first publication on the topic of polyhedra was the booklet entitled, "Polyhedron Models for the Classroom", which he wrote in 1966. He wrote to [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] and received a copy of ''Uniform polyhedra ''which had a complete list of all 75 [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedra]].'' ''After this, he spent a great deal of time building various polyhedra. He made 65 of them and had them on display in his classroom. At this point, Wenninger decided to contact a publisher to see if there was any interest in a book. He had the models photographed and wrote the accompanying text, which he sent off to [[Cambridge University Press]] in London. The publishers indicated an interest in the book only if Wenninger built all 75 of the [[List of uniform polyhedra|uniform polyhedra]].&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

Wenninger did complete the models, with the help of R. Buckley of [[Oxford University]] who had done the calculations for the [[Snub (geometry)|snub]] forms by computer. This allowed Wenninger to build these difficult polyhedra with the exact measurements for lengths of the edges and shapes of the faces. This was the first time that all of the uniform polyhedra had been made as paper models. This project took Wenninger nearly ten years, and the book, ''Polyhedron Models'', was published by the Cambridge University Press in 1971, largely due to the exceptional photographs taken locally in Nassau.&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

From 1971 onward, Wenninger focused his attention on the projection of the uniform polyhedra onto the surface of their circumscribing spheres. This led to the publication of his second book, ''Spherical Models'' in 1979, showing how regular, or semiregular, polyhedron can be used to build [[geodesic dome]]s. He also exchanged ideas with other mathematicians, [[Hugo Verheyen]] and [[Gilbert Fleurent]].&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

In 1981, Wenninger left the Bahamas and returned to St. John’s Abbey. His third book, ''Dual Models'', appeared in 1983. The book is a sequel to ''Polyhedron Models'', since it includes instructions on how to make paper models of the [[Dual polyhedron|duals]] of all 75 uniform polyhedra.&lt;ref name=Banchoff /&gt;

'''Musalla complex''' (also called Musallah Complex, Musalla of Gawhar Shad) is a large former Islamic religious complex located in Herat city in western Afghanistan. The 15th century complex is in ruins today. The complex ruins consist of the five huge 55 metre (180 feet) [[Musalla Minarets of Herat|Musallah Minarets of Herat]], mausoleums of Mir Ali Sher Navai, Hussein Baiqara and the ruins of a large [[mosque]] and Islamic [[madrasa]] school buildings. The complex was begun in 1417 by Queen [[Goharshad Begum]], the wife of Timurid ruler [[Shah Rukh]] who established Herat as the capital of the [[Timurid Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[ArchNet]], Masjid-i Jami'-i Gawhar Shad, Herat, Afghanistan, https://archnet.org/sites/3935/media_contents/40280&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It is thought that a madrasa was built in 1417 and a mosque was then built in 1426.&lt;ref&gt;[[ArchNet]], Masjid-i Jami'-i Gawhar Shad, Herat, Afghanistan, https://archnet.org/sites/3935/media_contents/40280&lt;/ref&gt; Sultan Husain's Madrasa was most likely built around 1493 (898 A.H.). The site contains examples of Timurid architecture although it has been heavily damaged, first by artillery fire in 1863, then during the [[Panjdeh incident]] of 1885 when most of the ruins were razed in an attempt to prevent its use as a base by the invading Russian army. Finally, an earthquake in 1932 destroyed two of the mosque's four minarets.&lt;ref&gt;[[ArchNet]], Masjid-i Jami'-i Gawhar Shad, Herat, Afghanistan, https://archnet.org/sites/3935/media_contents/40280&lt;/ref&gt;

The site rose to the attention of Europeans when it was visited and photographed in the 1930s by the travel writers [[Robert Byron]] and [[Annemarie Schwarzenbach]]. Byron's book, [[The Road to Oxiana]] mentions the minarets and discusses Timurid history.

== Preservation ==
Some emergency preservation work was carried out at the site in 2001 which included building protective walls around the Gawhar Shad Mausoleum and Sultan Husain Madrasa, repairing the remaining minaret of Gawhar Shad's Madrasa, and replanting the mausoleum garden.&lt;ref&gt;[[ArchNet]], Masjid-i Jami'-i Gawhar Shad, Herat, Afghanistan, https://archnet.org/sites/3935/media_contents/40280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://archnet.org/sites/3935/media_contents/40280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.touristspots.org/mousallah-complex-in-herat-afghanistan/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1059997.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adventuretravelphotos.com/?Action=_VC&amp;id=77029&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mystery plays''' and '''miracle plays''' (they are distinguished as two different forms although the terms are often used interchangeably&lt;ref&gt;'Properly speaking, Mysteries deal with Gospel events only). Miracle Plays, on the other hand, are concerned with incidents derived from the legends of the saints of the Church.' {{cite book|last=Ward|first=Augustus William|title=History of English dramatic literature|publisher=Macmillan|location=London, England|year=1875 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) are among the earliest formally developed [[Play (theatre)|plays]] in [[medieval Europe]]. Medieval mystery plays focused on the representation of [[Bible]] stories in [[Church (building)|churches]] as [[tableau vivant|tableaux]] with accompanying [[antiphon]]al song. They told of subjects such as the Creation, Adam and Eve, the murder of Abel, and the [[Last Judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;"Vernacular Drama | Medieval Drama." Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 27 May 2013. Web. 7 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Often they were performed together in cycles which could last for days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatrefolk.com/spotlights/72/download |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208054447/https://www.theatrefolk.com/spotlights/72/download |archive-date=8 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from ''[[Sacred Mysteries|mystery]]'' used in its sense of ''[[miracle]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|date=December 2009|chapter=mystery, n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but an occasionally quoted derivation is from ''ministerium'', meaning ''[[craft]]'', and so the 'mysteries' or plays performed by the [[craft guilds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gassner|first=John|author2=Quinn, Edward|title=The Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama|publisher=Methuen|location=London|year=1969|pages=203–204|chapter=England: middle ages|oclc=249158675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Mystery play 001.jpg|thumb|Mystery play, [[Flanders]], 15th century]]
As early as the fifth century living tableaux were introduced into sacred services.&lt;ref name=bellinger&gt;[http://www.theatrehistory.com/medieval/bellinger001.html Bellinger, Martha Fletcher, "A Thousand Years Of Quiescence And The Beginnings Of Sacred Drama", ''A Short History of the Drama'', New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1927. pp. 115-21]&lt;/ref&gt;
The plays originated as simple ''[[Trope (religion)|tropes]]'', verbal embellishments of liturgical texts, and slowly became more elaborate. At an early period chants from the service of the day were added to the prose dialogue. As these liturgical dramas increased in popularity, vernacular forms emerged, as travelling companies of actors and theatrical productions organized by local communities became more common in the later Middle Ages.

The ''[[Quem quaeritis?]]'' is the best known early form of the dramas, a dramatised liturgical dialogue between the angel at the tomb of Christ and the women who are seeking his body.&lt;ref name=bellinger/&gt; These primitive forms were later elaborated with dialogue and dramatic action. Eventually the dramas moved from church to the exterior - the churchyard and the public marketplace. These early performances were given in Latin, and were preceded by a vernacular prologue spoken by a herald who gave a synopsis of the events. The writers and directors of the earliest plays were probably monks. Religious drama flourished from about the ninth century to the sixteenth.

In 1210, suspicious of the growing popularity of miracle plays, [[Pope Innocent III]] issued a [[Papal bull|papal edict]] forbidding clergy from acting on a public stage. This had the effect of transferring the organization of the dramas to town guilds, after which several changes followed. Vernacular texts replaced Latin, and non-Biblical passages were added along with comic scenes, for example in the ''[[The Second Shepherds' Play|Secunda Pastorum]]'' of the [[Wakefield Cycle]]. Acting and characterization became more elaborate.

These vernacular religious performances were, in some of the larger cities in England such as [[York]], performed and produced by [[guild]]s, with each guild taking responsibility for a particular piece of scriptural history. From the guild control originated the term mystery play or mysteries, from the Latin ''ministerium''&lt;!-- with 'i', misterium means mystery --&gt; meaning "occupation" (i.e. that of the guilds). The genre was again banned, following the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] and the establishment of the [[Church of England]] in 1534.

The mystery play developed, in some places, into a series of plays dealing with all the major events in the Christian calendar, from the Creation to the Day of Judgment. By the end of the 15th century, the practice of acting these plays in cycles on festival days was established in several parts of Europe. Sometimes, each play was performed on a decorated pageant cart that moved about the city to allow different crowds to watch each play as well as provided actors with a dressing room as well as a stage&lt;ref&gt;"Mystery Play | Dramatic Genre." Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 27 May 2013. Web. 6 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire cycle could take up to twenty hours to perform and could be spread over a number of days. Taken as a whole, these are referred to as ''Corpus Christi cycles''. These cycles were often performed during the [[Feast of Corpus Christi]] and their overall design drew attention to Christ's life and his redemption for all of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Windeatt, Barry. "Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages." Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages. University of Cambridge, n.d. Web. 7 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plays were performed by a combination of professionals and amateurs and were written in highly elaborate stanza forms; they were often marked by the extravagance of the sets and 'special effects', but could also be stark and intimate. The variety of theatrical and poetic styles, even in a single cycle of plays, could be remarkable.

==English mystery plays==
[[File:04b266 adamandeve.jpg|thumb|Actors portraying [[Adam and Eve]] are expelled from paradise in a performance by the Players of St Peter]]
There are four complete or nearly complete extant English biblical collections of plays;&lt;ref&gt;Windeatt, Barry. "Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages." Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages. University of Cambridge, n.d. Web. 7 February 2015. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110111182223/http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/medieval/mystery_plays.php ]&lt;/ref&gt; although these collections are sometimes referred to as "cycles," it is now believed that this term may attribute to these collections more coherence than they in fact possess. The most complete is the ''[[York Mystery Plays|York cycle]]'' of forty-eight pageants; there are also the ''[[Wakefield Cycle|Towneley plays]]'' of thirty-two pageants, once thought to have been a true 'cycle' of plays acted at [[Wakefield]]; the [[N-Town Plays|Ludus Coventriae]], now generally agreed to be a redacted compilation of at least three older, unrelated plays, and the ''[[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester cycle]]'' of twenty-four pageants, now generally agreed to be an Elizabethan reconstruction of older medieval traditions. Also extant are two pageants from a New Testament [[Coventry Mystery Plays|cycle acted at Coventry]] and one pageant each from Norwich and Newcastle upon Tyne. Additionally, a fifteenth-century play of the life of [[Mary Magdalene]], ''[[The Brome Abraham and Isaac]]'' and a sixteenth-century play of the ''Conversion of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]'' exist, all hailing from [[East Anglia]]. Besides the [[Middle English]] drama, there are three surviving plays in [[Cornish language|Cornish]] known as the [[Ordinalia]], and several cyclical plays survive from continental Europe.

These biblical plays differ widely in content. Most contain episodes such as the ''Fall of Lucifer'', the ''Creation and Fall of Man'', ''Cain and Abel'', ''Noah and the Flood'', ''Abraham and Isaac'', the ''Nativity'', the ''Raising of Lazarus'', the ''Passion'', and the ''Resurrection''. Other pageants included the story of ''Moses'', the ''Procession of the Prophets'', ''Christ's Baptism'', the ''Temptation in the Wilderness'', and the ''Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin''. In given cycles, the plays came to be sponsored by the newly emerging Medieval [[craft guild]]s. The York [[mercery|mercers]], for example, sponsored the ''Doomsday'' pageant. Other guilds presented scenes appropriate to their trade: the building of the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] from the carpenters' guild; the [[Feeding the multitude|five loaves and fishes]] miracle from the bakers; and the [[visit of the Magi]], with their offerings of gold, frankincense and myrrh, from the goldsmiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oxenford|first=Lyn|title=Playing Period Plays |year=1958|publisher=Coach House Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=0853435499|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mikics|first=David |title=A New Handbook of Literary Terms |year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300106367|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guild associations are not, however, to be understood as the method of production for all towns. While the Chester pageants are associated with guilds, there is no indication that the N-Town plays are either associated with guilds or performed on [[pageant wagon]]s. Perhaps the most famous of the mystery plays, at least to modern readers and audiences, are those of Wakefield. Unfortunately, we cannot know whether the plays of the Towneley manuscript are actually the plays performed at Wakefield but a reference in the ''Second Shepherds' Play'' to [[Horbury|Horbery]] Shrogys &lt;ref&gt;http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-old?id=AnoTown&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/lv1/Archive/mideng-parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=13&amp;division=div (line 454) {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020830231810/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-old?data=%2Flv1%2FArchive%2Fmideng-parsed&amp;division=div&amp;id=AnoTown&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;part=13&amp;tag=public |date=30 August 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is strongly suggestive. In "The London Burial Grounds" by Mrs Basil Holmes (1897), the author claims that the Holy Priory Church, next to [[St Katherine Cree]] on Leadenhall Street, London was the location of miracle plays from the tenth to the sixteenth century. [[Edmund Bonner]], Bishop of London (c 1500 - 1569) stopped this in 1542.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londoncemeteries.co.uk/?page=holmes |title=The London Burial Grounds: Notes on their History from the Earliest Times to the Present Day -Mrs. Basil Holmes (St Katherine Cree) |publisher=Londoncemeteries.co.uk |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous plays of the Towneley collection are attributed to the Wakefield Master, an anonymous playwright who wrote in the fifteenth century. The epithet "Wakefield Master" was first applied to this individual by the literary historian Gayley. The Wakefield Master gets his name from the geographic location where he lived, the market-town of Wakefield in Yorkshire. He may have been a highly educated cleric there, or possibly a friar from a nearby monastery at Woodkirk, four miles north of Wakefield. It was once thought that this anonymous author wrote a series of 32 plays (each averaging about 384 lines) called the Towneley Cycle. The Master's contributions to this collection are still much debated, and some scholars believe he may have written fewer than ten of them. These works appear in a single manuscript, currently found in the Huntington Library of California. It shows signs of Protestant editing &amp;mdash; references to the Pope and the sacraments are crossed out, for instance. Likewise, twelve manuscript leaves were ripped out between the two final plays because of Catholic references. This evidence strongly suggests the play was still being read and performed as late as 1520, perhaps as late in Renaissance as the final years of King Henry VIII's reign.

The best known pageant in the Towneley manuscript is ''The Second Shepherds' Pageant'', a burlesque of the Nativity featuring Mak the sheep stealer and his wife Gill, which more or less explicitly compares a stolen lamb to the Saviour of mankind. The ''[[Harrowing of Hell]]'', derived from the apocryphal ''[[Acts of Pilate]]'', was a popular part of the York and Wakefield cycles.

The dramas of the [[Elizabethan theatre|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] periods were developed out of mystery plays.

==Spanish mystery plays==

The [[Misteri d'Elx]] (in English, the [[Elx Mystery Play]] or [[Mystery Play of Elx]]) is a liturgical drama dating from the Middle Ages which has been enacted and celebrated every year without any known interruptions. Commemorating the Assumption of Mary, it is played on every 14 and 15 August in the Basilica de Santa María in the city of [[Elx]] (also known as [[Elche]]). The prohibition of theatrical plays in churches by the [[Council of Trent]] eventually threatened to interrupt the yearly performance of the Misteri, but in 1632 [[Pope Urban VIII]] issued a special permit for its continuation. In 2001, UNESCO declared it one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

The oldest liturgical drama (12th century) written already in old Spanish language was a [[codex]] found in the library of the [[Toledo Cathedral]]. The Auto de los Reyes Magos belongs to the Christmas cycle. It is a play about the [[Biblical Magi]], three wise men from the East who followed a star and visited the baby Jesus in [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/liturgical-drama |title=Liturgical drama: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to have been based on an earlier liturgical Latin play written in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Spanish Language and Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miracle play==
Miracle plays, or ''Saint's plays,'' are now distinguished from mystery plays as they specifically re-enacted miraculous interventions by the [[saint]]s, particularly [[St. Nicholas]] or [[St. Mary]], into the lives of ordinary people, rather than biblical events;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|chapter=mystery play}}&lt;/ref&gt; however both of these terms are more commonly used by modern scholars than they were by medieval people, who used a wide variety of terminology to refer to their dramatic performances. [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]], writing in the 19th century, notes that "especially in England, miracle [came] to stand for religious play in general".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite indeed book|last=Chambers|first=Robert|title=Cyclopaedia of English Literature|publisher=Robert Chambers|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|year=1844|oclc=311881902}}, quoted in {{cite book|last=Clopper|first=Lawrence M.|title=Drama, play, and game: English festive culture in the medieval and early modern period|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2001|pages=69–70|isbn=978-0-226-11030-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cornish language]] miracle plays were performed in [[plain-an-gwarry (theatre)|plain-an-gwarrys]]. To capture the attention of the audience, "the plays were often noisy, bawdy and entertaining".&lt;ref name=HC&gt;[http://www.historic-cornwall.org.uk/a2m/medieval/plain_an_gwarry/st_just/st_just.htm ''St Just Plain-an-Gwarry''.] Historic Cornwall. Retrieved 23 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern performances==
Mystery Plays are still produced regularly throughout the [[United Kingdom]]. The local cycles were revived in both [[York]] and [[Chester]] in 1951 as part of the [[Festival of Britain]], and are still performed by the local guilds.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, Margaret. [http://www.yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/the-plays-and-the-guilds/ The Plays and the Guilds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101125612/http://www.yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/the-plays-and-the-guilds/ |date=1 November 2015 }}, ''York Mystery Plays''&lt;/ref&gt; The N-Town cycle was revived in 1978 as the [[Lincoln mystery plays]],

In 1977 the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] commissioned [[Tony Harrison]] to create ''[[The Mysteries (play)|The Mysteries]]'', a re-working of the [[Wakefield Cycle]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodsworth|first=Martin|date=9 January 1986|title=A poet in the land of as if|journal=[[The Guardian]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revived in 1985 (whereupon the production was filmed for [[Channel 4|Channel 4 Television]]), and again as a part of the theatre's millennium celebration in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Harrison |first=Tony |authorlink= |title=The Mysteries |year=1985 |publisher=Faber |location=London |isbn=0-571-13790-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The productions won [[Bill Bryden]] the "Best Director" title in both the [[Evening Standard Awards|Evening Standard Theatre Awards]] and the [[Olivier Awards]] for 1985, the year the three plays first appeared together in performance at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]]. An adaptation of Harrison's play was staged at [[Shakespeare's Globe]] in 2011 as ''The Globe Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's Globe. [http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/discovery-space/previous-productions/the-globe-mysteries The Globe Mysteries]. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[Isango Ensemble]] produced an African version of the Chester Cycle at the [[Garrick Theatre]] in London as ''The Mysteries – Yiimimangaliso'', performing in a combination of the [[Xhosa language]], the [[Zulu language]], English, [[Latin]] and [[Afrikaans]]. They revived an adapted version of the production at Shakespeare's Globe in 2015 as ''The Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's Globe.

'''Nancy Lee Gossels''' is a Jewish artist, editor and poet known for her sculpture and liturgical works. Gossels was named a Copley Artist in 1996 by the prestigious [[Copley Society of Art]]. She is also co-editor of the first egalitarian Jewish prayer book, ''[[Vetaher Libenu]]'', published in 1980.

==Personal life==
Born in [[Norwich, Connecticut]], Gossels was raised in [[Putnam, Connecticut]] by her parents, Benjamin and Sadie Tuber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Valedictorian Selected at Putnam School|newspaper=Putnam Patriot|date=ca. May 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received a Bachelor of Arts degree (magna cum laude) from [[Pembroke College (Brown University)]]&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss Nancy Tuber to Be Wed June 29|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 2, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was elected into the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] Society.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;  In 1958, she married [[C. Peter R. Gossels]].&lt;ref name="Who's Who"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gossels|first=C. Peter R.|title=Who's Who|year=2001|publisher=Marquis|pages=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have three children: Lisa R. Gossels, who was honored by the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] in 2001 which awarded her an Emmy for her film, ''The Children of Chabannes'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Children of Chabannes|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt020831|accessdate=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy D. Gossels, a casting director, film producer and teacher; and Daniel J. Gossels, an investment banker.&lt;ref name="Who's Who"/&gt;

==Artistic career==
Gossels worked at ''The Atlantic Monthly'' from 1956 to 1958.&lt;ref name="Harvard Alumni Report"&gt;{{cite book|title=Harvard Class of 1952: 10th Anniversary Report|year=1962|publisher=Harvard University|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gossels subsequently served as associate editor of ''Child Life Magazine'' from 1958 to 1960&lt;ref name="Who's Who" /&gt; and as a reporter and columnist for the ''Cochituate/Wayland/Weston Town Crier'' from 1962 to 1964.

Gossels began her artistic career as a painter, but over time found that her painting was becoming more and more sculptural. In 1986, Gossels and Brenda Zaltas exchanged ideas about designing outdoor sculptures from found metal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstein|first=Myrna Chandler|title=The Art of Menorot|newspaper=Home for the Holidays|date=November 12, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered that the metal shapes reminded them of menorahs and embarked on a new career. Although they worked separately, they shared a vision and often showed their work together in art exhibits and galleries.&lt;ref name="Sudbury Town Crier"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adair|first=Jeff|title=Artist's work getting national exposure|newspaper=The Sudbury Town Crier|date=February 21, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1980s, Gossels has received national attention for her unique "found metal" sculptures, both religious and non-religious, which "have been shown in museums, galleries and selected juried exhibitions" across the U.S.,&lt;ref name="Sudbury Town Crier"/&gt; including the [[Bronx Museum of the Arts]], [[Yeshiva University Museum]], the [[National Museum of American Jewish History]] in Philadelphia, Mizel Museum in Denver,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carlock|first=Marty|title=Hardware wears well with artwork of Gossels|newspaper=The Wayland-Weston Town Crier|date=December 22, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Flagler Museum]] in Palm Beach.&lt;ref name="Wayland Town Crier"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwood|first=Susan L.|title=Bringing Menorahs to Life|newspaper=The Wayland Town Crier|date=December 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the In the Spirit Studio / Gallery in [[New York City]] featured her aluminum and brass [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] titled, ''Brave New World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In the Spirit of Chanukah|newspaper=Newsday|date=November 20, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCalls featured Gossels' ''Reflections'', a [[Chanukah]] lamp with bronze mirror back, in its December 1990 article, "The Art of the Menorah."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schiller|first=Phyllis|title=The Art of the Menorah|newspaper=McCalls|date=December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liturgical work==
In addition to her sculpture, Gossels is a poet. According to an interview in the ''Wayland Town Crier'', designing sculptural pieces made her realize "the connection between the written word and the visual piece."&lt;ref name="Sudbury Town Crier" /&gt;

While serving as a member of the National Commission on Worship of the Jewish reform movement between 1976 and 1980 and as Vice President of [http://www.bethelsudbury.org Congregation Beth El of the Sudbury River Valley] in [[Sudbury, Massachusetts]], Gossels composed and edited (with Joan S. Kaye and her husband, C. Peter R. Gossels) the first egalitarian Jewish prayer book for the Sabbath and Festivals, ''[[Vetaher Libenu]]'', which was published in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vetaher Libenu|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many innovations contained in ''Vetaher Libenu'', Nancy Lee Gossels and Joan S. Kaye revised the traditional Hebrew translation of "Barukh atah Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha’olam," or "Praised are You, Adonai our God, Ruler to the Universe," to "Holy One of Blessing, Your Presence Fills Creation." This invocation is now used by many Reform congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Lawrence A.|title=Blessings and Their Translations {{!}} Current Jewish Liturgies|journal=60 Worship 134| date=March 1986 |pages=145–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Sidney|title=Finding a Spiritual Home: How a New Generation of Jews Can Transform the American Synagogue|year=2000|publisher=Jossey-Bass|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Painting and Travel''''' is an educational television show produced by Roger and Sarah Bansemer. It is broadcast primarily on [[PBS]] channels.
A typical episode begins with Sarah narrating a video tour of the filming location, which is chosen for its scenic or historic interest. The video tour ends with an introduction to Roger's painting project for the episode. Roger then demonstrates the painting process and teaches painting principles as he does so. His painting demonstration is usually interrupted by Sarah interviewing someone in the area.
Most of the paintings are [[seascape]]s and [[Landscape painting|rural scenes]].
Roger paints in [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]] and [[Oil paint|oils]], in the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] style. All episodes are 30 minutes in length.

'''''Philosophy: Who Needs It''''' is a collection of essays by [[Ayn Rand]], published posthumously in 1982. It was the last book on which Rand worked during her lifetime.

==Publishing history==
Rand had begun work on the collection prior to her death, but the final editing was handled by her heir, [[Leonard Peikoff]]. Most of the essays originally appeared in ''[[The Ayn Rand Letter]]''.&lt;ref name="Baker93"&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|1987|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bobbs-Merrill]] published the hardcover edition in September 1982, followed by a trade paperback edition in September 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perinn|1990|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New American Library]] published it as a mass market paperback in November 1984. The New American Library edition was promoted as volume one of the "Ayn Rand Library" series edited by Peikoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perinn|1990|p=41}}; {{harvnb|Baker|1987|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The title essay is an address given to the graduating class of the [[United States Military Academy]] on March 6, 1974, in which Rand argues that [[philosophy]] plays a central role in all human activities, that every action or thought has certain assumptions, and that humans need to examine those assumptions to live a full, meaningful life. Another speech included is "Faith and Force: The Destroyers of the Modern World", which was delivered at college appearances in 1960.&lt;ref name="Gladstein83-85"&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=83–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining chapters are reprints of articles Rand published in the 1970s, primarily in her periodical ''[[The Ayn Rand Letter]]''. These reprints include "Kant Versus Sullivan", which is about how [[William Gibson (playwright)|William Gibson's]] play ''[[The Miracle Worker (play)|The Miracle Worker]]'' illustrates the importance of language and conceptual learning,&lt;ref name="Gladstein83-85"/&gt; "An Open Letter to Boris Spassky", addressed to [[Soviet]] [[chess]] [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[Boris Spassky]], and "The Stimulus and the Response", a critique of the book ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]]'' by psychologist [[B. F. Skinner]].&lt;ref name="Baker93"/&gt;

==Reception==
At the time of its release, the book received mostly negative reviews.&lt;ref name="Annual"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ayn Rand in Review |first=Michael S. |last=Berliner |work=Archives Annual: The Newsletter of the Ayn Rand Archives |volume=3 |year=2000 |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/DocServer/volume3.pdf |page=23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105062311/http://www.aynrand.org/site/DocServer/volume3.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the [[libertarian]] magazine ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', philosopher [[Douglas Den Uyl]] gives the book a "mixed assessment", saying that several of the essays are worth reading, but the book as a whole "is not particularly original or substantive" in comparison to her previous works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Den Uyl |authorlink=Douglas Den Uyl |title=Rand's Last Words |work=Reason |date=May 1983 |volume=15 |issue=1 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Den Uyl reaches a similar conclusion in collaboration with [[Douglas B. Rasmussen]], writing in ''[[The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand]]'' that the book "does not contain the kind of significant philosophizing found in her earlier works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Douglas |last1=Den Uyl |last2=Rasmussen |first2=Douglas |chapter=Conclusion |title=[[The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand]] |editor1-last=Den Uyl |editor1-first=Douglas |editor2-last=Rasmussen |editor2-first=Douglas |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-252-01033-7 |oclc=9392804 |lastauthoramp=y |page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later scholars have also criticized the book, as well as some of its essays. Historian James Baker writes that the volume "lacks the strength to launch any significant project".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|1987|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Fred Seddon says that Rand's explanation of the ethical views of [[Immanuel Kant]] in the essay "Causality versus Duty" is a [[straw man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ayn Rand, Objectivists, and the History of Philosophy |last=Seddon |first=Fred |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=University Press of America |year=2003 |isbn=0-7618-2308-5 |oclc=51969016 |pages=75–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George H. Smith]] describes "Causality versus Duty" as "an important essay" describing Rand's views on morality, but criticizes her for another essay in which she criticized the views expressed by philosopher [[John Rawls]] in his book ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' without having read the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Atheism, Ayn Rand, and Other Heresies |last=Smith |first=George H. |authorlink=George H. Smith |location=Buffalo, New York |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=1991 |isbn=0-87975-577-6 |oclc=22593041 |page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First publication of stories===
The first UK magazine publication of all the stories has not been fully documented. The known listing is as follows:

* ''Problem at Pollensa Bay'': First published in issue 539 of the ''[[Strand Magazine]]'' in November 1935. The story was illustrated by Jack M. Faulks. The detective is [[Parker Pyne]].
* ''The Second Gong'': First published in issue 499 of the ''Strand Magazine'' in July 1932. This story with [[Hercule Poirot]] was the basis of the novella ''[[Dead Man's Mirror]]'' in 1935.
* ''Yellow Iris'': First published in issue 559 of the ''Strand Magazine'' in July 1937. This story with Hercule Poirot was the basis of the novel ''[[Sparkling Cyanide]]'', in which Poirot was replaced by [[Colonel Race]] and the plot was heavily altered.
* ''The Love Detectives'': First published in issue 236 of ''[[The Story-Teller]]'' magazine in December 1926 under the title of ''At the Crossroads''. This was the first of a series of six stories in consecutive issues of the magazine titled ''The Magic of Mr. Quin''. The remaining five were later published in book form in ''[[The Mysterious Mr. Quin]]'' in 1930. The plot has similarities to 1930 [[Miss Marple]] novel [[The Murder at the Vicarage]]
* ''The Regatta Mystery'': First published in issue 546 of the ''Strand Magazine'' in June 1936 under the title ''Poirot and the Regatta Mystery''. The story was illustrated by Jack M. Faulks. The story was later rewritten by Christie to change the detective from Hercule Poirot to Parker Pyne before its first book publication in the US in ''[[The Regatta Mystery|The Regatta Mystery and Other Stories]]'' in 1939. The publication in the ''Strand Magazine'' remained the only publication of the original version of the story in the UK until 2008, when it was included in the omnibus volume "Hercule Poirot: the Complete Short Stories" ({{ISBN|978-0006513773}}).
* ''Next To A Dog'': First published in issue 295 of the ''[[Grand Magazine]]'' in September 1929.
* ''Magnolia Blossom'': First published in issue 329 of the ''[[Royal Magazine]]'' in March 1926. The story first appeared in book form in the UK in the 1982 collection ''The Agatha Christie Hour'' ({{ISBN|0-00-231-3316}}) to tie in with a dramatisation of the story in the television series of the same name.

No magazine publication of ''The Harlequin Tea Set'' has yet been traced; the story was first published in book form in the UK in ''Winter's Crimes #3'' in 1971 by [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan]] ({{ISBN|0-333-12871-0}}).

In [[film industry|film]] and [[television]], a '''production designer''' ('''PD''') is the person responsible for the overall visual look of the production. Production designers have a key creative role in the creation of motion pictures and television. Working directly with the [[film director|director]], [[cinematographer]], and [[film producer|producer]], they must select the settings and style to visually tell the story. The term ''production designer'' was coined by [[William Cameron Menzies]] while he was working on the film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Cairns |first=David |year=2011 |title=The Dreams of a Creative Begetter |url=https://believermag.com/the-dreams-of-a-creative-begetter/ |magazine=The Believer |issue=79 |access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously (and often subsequently) the people with the same responsibilities were called ''[[art director]]s''.{{sfn|Preston|1994|p=150}} It is sometimes also described as ''[[scenic design]]'' or ''set design''.

== Societies and trade organizations ==
In the United States and British Columbia,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} production designers are represented by the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] local 800,{{sfn|Rizzo|2015|p=396}} the Art Directors Guild. The production design credit must be requested by the producer, prior to completion of photography, and submitted to the Art Directors Guild Board of Directors for the credit approval. 
In the rest of Canada, production designers are represented by the [[Director's Guild of Canada]].

The '''''Punishment of the Sons of Corah''''' or '''''Punishment of the Rebels''''' is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Sandro Botticelli]], executed in 1480–1482 in the [[Sistine Chapel]], [[Rome]].

==History==
On 27 October 1480 Botticelli, together with other Florentine painters, left for Rome, where he had been called as part of the reconciliation project between [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], the ''de facto'' ruler of [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], and [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. The Florentines started to work in the [[Sistine Chapel]] as early as the Spring of 1481, along with [[Pietro Perugino]], who was already there.

The theme of the decoration was a parallel between the Stories of Moses and those of Christ, as a sign of continuity between the [[Old Testament|Old]] and the [[New Testament]]. A continuity also between the divine law of the Tables and the message of Jesus, who, in turn, chose Peter (the first bishop of Rome) as his successor: this would finally result in  a legitimation of the latter's successors, the popes of Rome.

Botticelli, helped by numerous assistants, painted three scenes. On 17 February 1482 his contract was renovated, including the other scenes to complete the chapel's decoration. However, on the 20th of the same month, his father died: he returned to Florence, where he remained.

==Description==
The painting depicts three episodes and tells of a rebellion by the [[Israelites]] against [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]]. On the right the rebels attempt to stone Moses after becoming disenchanted by their trials on their emigration from Egypt. [[Joshua]] has placed himself between the rebels and Moses, protecting him from the stoning. The center scene shows the rebellion with [[Korah#Korah, son of Izhar, leader of a rebellion against Moses|Korah]] and the conspirators being driven out by Moses and Aaron, as high priest wearing the papal diadem. To the left, the ground opens and the two principal conspirators sink into it. The children of Korah are spared the fate of their father.

The intended message of the painting is clear, no one should doubt the authority of the [[Pope]] over the Church. The power of the papacy was constantly being questioned at the time.

'''''Republican Party Reptile''''', subtitled ''The Confessions, Adventures, Essays and (Other) Outrages of P. J. O'Rourke'' is a 1987 collection of essays by American satirical writer [[P. J. O'Rourke]].&lt;ref name="NY Times -03May1987 - Lewis Frumkes - Paperbacks; The Beast Above the Surface"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/books/paperbacks-the-beast-above-the-surface.html|title=Paperbacks; The Beast Above the Surface|last=[[Lewis Frumkes]]|date=May 3, 1987|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humorist [[Lewis Frumkes]]' review of the collection, he described it as only occasionally displaying O'Rourke's best writing.&lt;ref name="NY Times -03May1987 - Lewis Frumkes - Paperbacks; The Beast Above the Surface"/&gt;
O'Rourke planned to promote the book at the [[1988 Republican National Convention|1988]] [[Republican National Convention]].  Though he described himself as a conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], this was not allowed, reportedly because the GOP did not appreciate O'Rourke's  sense of humor.&lt;ref name="The Bryan Times - 16Aug1998 - People in the News - Book Ban at Convention"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vOAhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hFcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3404,4151687&amp;dq=republican-party-reptile&amp;hl=en|title=People in the News - Book Ban at Convention|date=August 16, 1988|work=[[The Bryan Times]]|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the essay that gives its title to the collection O'Rourke describes a "Republican Party Reptile":&lt;ref name="Google Books - Republican Party Reptile"&gt;{{cite book|last=[[P. J.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We are in favor of: guns, drugs, fast cars, free love (if our wives don't find out), a sound dollar, and a strong military with spiffy uniforms. There are thousands of people in America who feel this way, especially after three or four drinks. If all of us would unite and work together, we could give this country. . . well, a real bad hangover."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The collection includes the article "How to Drive Fast on Drugs While Getting Your Wing-Wang Squeezed and Not Spill Your Drink" which had previously been published in ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' in 1979, and was later included in the collection ''[[Driving Like Crazy]]''.&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph - 20Sep2009 - PJ O'Rourke: a hellraiser who had to slow down

'''Scherenschnitte''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃeːʁənˌʃnɪtə}}), which means "scissor cuts" in [[German language|German]], is the art of [[paper cutting]] design. The artwork often has rotational symmetry within the design, and common forms include silhouettes, valentines, and love letters. The art tradition was founded in [[Switzerland]] and [[Germany]] in the 16th century and was brought to [[Colonial America]] in the 18th century by Swiss and German immigrants who settled primarily in [[Pennsylvania]].

The '''Shaki Museum of History and Local Lore''' is a museum located in Sheki city of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The museum is named after the Azerbaijani pedagogue, writer and ethnographer Rashid Bey Efendiyev.

==History==
The Shaki Museum of History and Local Lore was established under decision of [[People's Commissariat for Education|Commissariat for Education]] in September 1925. In 1980, the museum moved to a building, which was built as a barracks in 1895.&lt;ref name="gomap"&gt;{{cite web|title= Rəşid bəy Əfəndiyev adına Tarix-Diyarşünaslıq Muzeyi|url= https://kataloq.gomap.az/az/all-poi/culture/museum/8b292882d56611e0ad4900226424597d|publisher= kataloq.gomap.az|language= az|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total area of the museum is 924 m² and 724 m² of it are reserved for the exhibition halls. More than 5000 exhibits reflecting the history, culture, ancient art forms, ethnography and cuisine of Shaki are exhibited in the museum.&lt;ref name="azculture"&gt;{{cite web|title= R.Əfəndiyev adına Şəki şəhər Tarix-diyarşünaslıq muzeyi|url= http://www.azculture.az/r-f-ndiyev-adina-s-ki-s-h-r-tarix-diyarsunasliq-muzeyi/|publisher= azculture.az|language= az|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 3,000 of them are exhibited in exposition rooms.&lt;ref name="shekitravel"&gt;{{cite web|title= R.B. Əfəndiyev adına tarix diyarşünaslıq muzeyi|url= http://sheki.travel/az/accommodation/1021-RB-Efendiyev-adina-tarix-diyarshunasliq-muzeyi |publisher= sheki.travel|language= az|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also stands reflecting participation of Shaki people in Great Patriotic War (1941–1945), as well as in [[Soviet–Afghan War|Afghanistan]] and [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Karabakh]] wars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5034">The '''Spassguerilla''' (fun guerrilla) was a grouping within the [[student protest]] movement of the 1960s in Germany that agitated for social change, in particular for a more [[libertarian]], less authoritarian, and less materialistic society, using tactics characterized by disrespectful humour and provocative and disruptive actions of a minimally violent nature. Events organized by the groups included such actions as [[Pieing|attacking]] politicians or the police with [[custard pie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal   | last = Teune | first = Simon   | title = Humour as a Guerrilla Tactic: The West German Student Movement's Mockery of the Establishment   | journal = International Review of Social History   | volume =  52 | pages = 115–132  | publisher = Cambridge University Press  | date = 2007-11-21   | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1436104   | doi = 10.1017/S002085900700315X   | accessdate = 2008-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main proponents was [[Fritz Teufel]], sometimes referred to as the political clown of the [[Extraparliamentary Opposition]]. The lack of respect for traditional, "[[bourgeois]]," "repressive"  forms of authority and ritual, countered by irony and humour,  was typified by Fritz Teufel's reply when told to stand for the judge at a trial: "If it helps the search for the truth" (''Wenn's der Wahrheitsfindung dient'').

The tactics and attitudes of this grouping including Fritz Teufel were in contrast to the more serious, revolutionary rhetoric and actions of other groups centred on the [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund|SDS]] and figures like [[Rudi Dutschke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | last = Fitz   | first = Birgit  | title = Die Konstruktion der Vergangenheit am Beispiel Rudi Dutschke.: Eine vergleichende Inhaltsanalyse der Zeitungen "Bild" und "Der Spiegel" (Studienarbeit)

[[File:Wolfgang Lefèvre (1968).jpg|thumb|Wolfgang Lefèvre (1968)]]
The tactics of the Spassguerilla were characterized by [[civil disobedience]], symbolic (rather than real) violence, provocation of authority, using  actions of the "authoritarian" state, such as trials, as opportunities for "unmasking" outdated traditions.&lt;ref name="bpb1"&gt;{{cite web   | last = Walther   | first = Rudolf   | title = Ein direkter Weg von der Spassguerilla zum Terrorismus?

It was Wolfgang Lefèvre who said that every event or demonstration should be planned so as to be fun for the participants.&lt;ref name="bpb1"/&gt;

While Rudi Dutschke talked of a "Stadtguerilla" ([[urban guerrilla]]), Fritz Teufel talked of a "Spassguerilla" (fun guerrilla).

The forms of provocative and disruptive protest invented by the Spassguerilla were later adopted by the peace movement of the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;

Similar forms of disruption have also been adopted by Cyberspace activists ("[[Hacktivism|hacktivists]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | last = Teubener  | first = Katy   | chapter= Flanieren als Protestbewegung   | title = Forschungsfeld Politik: geschlechtskategoriale Einführung in die Sozialwissenschaften|editor=Cilja Harders |editor2=Heike Kahlert |editor3=Delia Schindler  |publisher = VS Verlag   | year  = 2005   | pages = 302   | isbn = 3-8100-4074-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The word ''Spaßgerilja''==
Fritz Teufel used the word "Spaßgerilja". Though the normal German spelling is ''Spaßguerilla'', Teufel's spelling became known as the "teuflische Schreibweise" (a pun meaning either "Teufelian" spelling or "diabolical spelling"; ''Teufel'' in German means devil). This spelling is retained by some, including academics (see references).

The [[Spectrum Award]] for Grand Master has been awarded annually since 1995 by the Spectrum Fantastic Art Advisory Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.spectrumfantasticart.com/board.php|title = Spectrum Fantastic Advisory Board|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Grand Master, as Arnie Fenner (SFA Advisory Board member) has explained, is an artist who has worked for at least twenty years at a consistently high level of quality; who has influenced and inspired other artists; and who has left his or her mark on the field as a whole. "Craft alone" he writes, " is not sufficient to receive the honor: There are many painters who produce solid professional work. But (and this is the key) it fails to resonate. It is admired in the moment and immediately forgotten. A Grand Master's art, on the other hand, gets stuck in the viewer's heart and memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Spectrum 21: The Best In Contemporary Fantastic Art|last = Fleskes|first = John|publisher = Flesk Publications|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-933865-58-4|location = |pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnie Fenner also states "At the time of the designation is given the artist must be living. Recently, two GM honorees died prior to the announcement --Al Williamson and Ralph McQuarrie-- which confused a few people, but...both were still with us when the Board bestowed the honor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://muddycolors.blogspot.com/2012/10/grand-master.html|title = Grand Master post by Arnie Fenner on Muddy Colors|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge''''' is a painting attributed to  the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] master [[Caravaggio|Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio]] (1571–1610).

The picture has been variously dated between 1601 and 1610 (Caravaggio scholar John T. Spike lists the date as circa 1603 in the second revised edition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.johntspike.com/uploads/CARAVA_2010.pdf|title=Caravaggio, Second Revised Edition|last=Spike|first=John T.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of his study of the artist). It depicts a wicker basket heaped with various fruit and vegetables sitting on a stone table, caught in Caravaggio's usual strong yet mellow shaft of [[top-left lighting|light falling from top left]], "as if through a hole in the ceiling." (Caravaggio at around this time was sued by a landlady for having cut a hole in the ceiling of the rooms he rented, presumably to create his characteristic lighting). The bulk of the space is taken up by the large melons, marrows and pumpkins, the watermelon and pumpkin cut open to display the interior, the marrows, long and twisting, seeming to wish to escape the two-dimensional space of the picture plane.

While at one level the painting is a bravura study of texture and form and light, the [[Renaissance]] symbology of fruit and vegetables was rich and intricate, and given this fact and the fact that so many of Caravaggio's apparently simple paintings, such as ''[[Boy Bitten by a Lizard (Caravaggio)|Boy Bitten by a Lizard]]'', in fact carry coded messages, it is not unlikely that the ''Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge'' is equally complex. Nevertheless, no plausible reading has so far been advanced, although several commentators have noted the visual suggestiveness of the moistly cut fruits and melons and the writhing, thrusting marrows.

It was first recorded in the collection of Cardinal [[Antonio Barberini]] in 1671, as being "in the hand" of the artist; how it came to be there (and this is the first recorded mention of its existence) is open to speculation, but Barberini is known to have bought up part of the collection of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Francesco Maria Del Monte]], Caravaggio's first patron, when the cardinal died in 1627 . It may therefore have been a private work for Del Monte.

Another possibility is that in 1644 Cardinal Antonio Barberini inherited the ''Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge'' from his uncle, Pope Urban VIII, who was the greatest patron of the Roman Baroque and an avid art collector. It is documented that in 1603, while he was still a cardinal, Urban VIII acquired a number of paintings directly from Caravaggio.  The ''Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge'' could easily have been one of these.  It shares the same dimensions and the same palette as the ''Sacrifice of Isaac'' now at the Uffizi, which is known to have been part of this group and which dates from the same period in Caravaggio's career.

Caravaggio has justly been credited as the father of Roman still-life painting, a genre which was in its infancy in the early 17th century.  Although Caravaggio very frequently included still-life elements in his works, only two independent still lifes from his hand have been identified to date. These are the ''Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge'' and the ''Basket of Fruit'' at the Ambrosiana in Milan. Because of both the extraordinary virtuosity of its execution and the complexity of meaning suggested by its composition, scholars have referred to the ''Still Life with Fruit on a Stone Ledge'' as a "capital picture for the artist" and a "masterpiece of still life."

'''''The Breed''''' is a 2006 [[horror film]] directed by Nicholas Mastandrea. This marked Mastandrea's directorial debut. It was released in May at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and subsequently released in other film markets and festivals around the world.

==Plot==
The movie begins with a couple on a small sailboat who find a small island and begin to look around. The girl sneakily wanders off while the man ties up the boat. She stumbles across a fence and a small compound, but no one seems to be around. She is then attacked by unknown creatures. The man at the boat is startled by her screams.

Sometime later, a [[Republic RC-3 Seabee|seaplane]] heads to what appears to be the same island. Matt ([[Eric Lively|Lively]]) and John ([[Oliver Hudson|Hudson]]) are two brothers who are heading to the island for a week of fun and relaxation. The island was owned by their uncle, who built a cabin on it. He recently died, and the island is otherwise uninhabited. The brothers are joined by three friends, Nicki ([[Michelle Rodriguez|Rodriguez]]), Sara ([[Taryn Manning|Manning]]) and Noah ([[Hill Harper|Harper]]). Upon landing, they moor the seaplane at a dock near the cabin.

Soon after they arrive, a puppy shows up. The friends take him in to the cabin. Noah goes into the kitchen to get a drink. The puppy follows him in. The puppy then mysteriously growls at him and runs off. Sara and John then follow him out. They are ambushed by an older vicious dog and Sara is bitten by it. The pair manage to get back to the cabin.

The following morning, the men are in the forest. They bump into the man who came to the island at the beginning of the movie. He is bloody and warns them about the dogs. A pack of dogs attack and eat him. The men run back to the cabin and tell the women to come inside. A dog attacks Nicki and John shoots an arrow, wanting to kill the animal, but accidentally impales Nicki's shin instead. They are soon under siege by more vicious dogs.

The friends decide they must leave the island, but dogs have surrounded the plane. As they have no other way off the island, and no means of communication, they will have to wait out the dogs. However, a few minutes later, they see the plane has detached from its moorings and is drifting toward the ocean; the dogs have chewed through the ropes to force the friends out of the cabin. When John attempts to swim to the plane, the dogs are on the plane and they attack him. However, he manages to swim to the dock, then the friends retreat to the house. Sara begins to show distinct canine behavior, such as a ravenous appetite and growling.

Their next idea is to make their way to a storage shed and drive their uncle's car to the training compound, where they believe they can call for help. However, the car won't start and that night, with no other options, they continue to party. The power goes out, and Noah heads to the fuse box in the basement, where he is killed by dogs who have managed to enter the house. The dogs then find their way into the rest of the cabin, and Matt is bitten. John, Matt, Nicki and Sara have to hide in the attic. There, they discover paperwork relating to the training facility, and learn it was an Army facility to train attack dogs.

The next morning, the dogs have left. Matt and John make another attempt and manage to pop the clutch of their uncle's [[Mercedes Benz]]. They go back to pick up the women, but Sara does not want to leave. The dogs attack again, and in fighting one, Sara falls out of the window and impales herself and the dog on a post.

Matt, John, and Nicki drive to the facility and find it abandoned. They break in and discover that the dogs were being [[genetic engineering|genetically enhanced]]. John finds communications equipment, but a power cable on the antenna has been disconnected, so he goes out to fix it. Having been bitten, Matt learns he can sense the dogs, and realizes if they escaped they can get back in. When the antenna is powered up, John is accidentally shocked by electricity, and when he falls to the ground the dogs attack him. Matt shows up with a baseball bat to fight off the dogs, but a power surge has caused a fire in the compound. Nicki realizes the fire is creating a backdraft, and lures in the dogs before exposing them to the fire. The building then explodes.

John tells Matt he saw a nearby boat, which was owned by the couple from beginning of the film. When the dogs surround them, Nicki shows up in the Mercedes, they jump in and drive off. Because there are so many dogs, they cannot stop the car and get out, so John has Nicki drive the car off the pier. They swim to the boat and sail off. Thinking they are safe, they wonder if they can make it to medical facilities before Matt and John fall victim to the dog bites. In the last shot, they open the door to the sleeping quarters, and a stowaway dog leaps out.

'''''The Last Judgment''''' ([[tempera]] on panel) is a [[painting]] by the Renaissance artist [[Fra Angelico]]. It was commissioned by the [[Camaldolese]] Order for the newly elected abbot, the humanist scholar [[Ambrogio Traversari]].&lt;ref name=Welch&gt;Evelyn S. Welch
, ''Art in Renaissance Italy, 1350-1500'', Oxford University Press, 2000, p146. {{ISBN|0-19-284279-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is variously dated to c1425,&lt;ref name=Scudieri&gt;Magnolia Scudieri, ''Museum of San Marco'', Giunti, 1991, p17. {{ISBN|88-09-01341-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1425–30&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Malaguzzi, ''Fra Angelico'', Giunti, 2003, p18. {{ISBN|88-09-03054-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1431.&lt;ref name=Welch/&gt; It was originally sited in the church of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli, Florence|Santa Maria degli Angeli]]&lt;ref name=Scudieri/&gt; and now is in the museum of [[San Marco, Florence]].  It is not to be confused with another Fra Angelico ''Last Judgement'' in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]].

==Description==
Like most of Fra Angelico's work, the [[iconography]] is standard for the contemporary treatments of the Last Judgement. Among the most common subjects of painting in churches, it is found more often on walls.  In the top centre of the picture, [[Christ in Judgement|Christ sits in judgement]] on a white throne surrounded by [[angel]]s, [[BVM(RC)|Mary]], [[Saint John the Evangelist|John]], and the [[saints]]. Christ is shown as judge of the living and dead, his left hand pointing down to [[Christian views on Hell|Hell]], his right up to [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]]. On Christ's right hand is [[paradise]], with angels leading the [[salvation|saved]] through a beautiful garden into a shining city. In the middle are the broken [[tombs]] of the risen dead, come out of their graves to be finally [[Justification (theology)|judged]]. On Christ's left [[demons]] drive the damned into Hell, where the wicked are tormented. At the very bottom [[Satan]] chews on three of the damned, and grasps two others.

'''Tseten Dorjee''', &lt;!-- this is not verified (also known as, '''Thinley Gyatso'''--&gt; (born 2 December 1960 in [[Tibet]]) is a Tibetan [[thangka]] painter.

== Biography ==
Tseten Dorjee was born 2 December 1960 in Tibet and went in exile in India&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Kidston, [http://helenair.com/lifestyles/tibetan-artists-in-exile-at-home-in-basin/article_241f2195-44f6-556e-86ca-d97db96ea6f6.html Tibetan artists in exile at home in Basin] , July 24, 2005, [[Independent Record]]&lt;/ref&gt; to receive his early education at the Central School for Tibetans, in [[Darjeeling]], India. Dorjee started the study of [[thangka]] painting between 1974 and 1980 when he took private lessons from the late Venerable [[Ngawang Norbu]] (1903–1996). He continued his study from 1980 to 1986 at the Gyudmed Tantric Monastery, located in [[Mysore]], South India.

Dorjee received commissions from the [[14th Dalai Lama]], the Royal Family of Sikkim and various major monasteries in India. Dorjee traveled and painted thangkas outside of India in [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], [[Munich]] and USA.&lt;ref&gt;John Stromnes, [http://www.tibet.ca/en/library/wtn/archive/old?y=2005&amp;m=7&amp;p=22_3 Tibetan artists spend summer painting in Basin], [[Missoulian]], July 21, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the wish of his teacher, Dorjee started teaching thangka painting in 1995. Over the years, 11 students, after four to five years under his guidance became accomplished thankga painters. As of 2011 he was instructing six full-time students. 
Dorjee became a faculty member of [[Naropa University]]'s Study Abroad Program in Sikkim in the fall of 2002. Its Director, Clarke D. Warren, stated, “Being a scholar of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] I have been an avid connoisseur of thangka painting for many years and Tseten is amongst the finest I have seen anywhere, in its mastery of tradition, style and execution.”

Dorjee created and co-owns with his wife and brother a [[Sikkim]] travel agency.

Dorjee founded and serves as director of a non-profit organization that provides medical care, education and clothing and living costs for poor families, needy elders and children.

'''UGallery''' is a curated [[online art gallery]] headquartered in San Francisco. Founded in 2006, UGallery is an e-commerce platform that connects artists directly with collectors on its website. The company positions itself as an approachable and convenient alternative to the brick-and-mortar [[contemporary art gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New study: many find buying art more intimidating than buying real estate|url = http://www.privateartinvestor.com/owning-art/new-study-many-find-buying-art-more-intimidating-than-buying-real-estate/|website = Private Art Investor|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Infobox company

== History ==

The company was founded by Alex Farkas, Stephen Tanenbaum and Greg Rosborough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = College Business Plans that Made the Grade|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/182608|website = Entrepreneur|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three met in a business class at the [[University of Arizona]]. Sharing an interest in the arts, they developed the concept for UGallery through the McGuire Entrepreneurship Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = McGuire Program grad UGallery continues to connect people and art|url = https://entrepreneurship.eller.arizona.edu/news-article/mcguire-program-grad-ugallery-continues-connect-people-and-art|website = McGuire Center for Entrepreneurship|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UGallery.com website launched in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Get Schooled|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/167156|website = Entrepreneur|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally seen as a way to help recent [[art school]] graduates find buyers, UGallery began with five artists and 25 pieces of [[Contemporary art|original art]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Conversation With UGallery Co-Founders Alex Farkas and Stephen Tanenbaum|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonborbet/2015/06/04/a-conversation-with-ugallery-co-founders-alex-farkas-and-stephen-tanenbaum/|website = Forbes|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Securing outside capital in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ugallery Funding &amp; Ugallery Investors – CB Insights|url = https://www.cbinsights.com/company/ugallery-funding|website = www.cbinsights.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company shifted its focus to mid-career and emerging artists from around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As of February 2014, UGallery exhibits the work of 500 professional artists and more than 6,500 pieces of original paintings, [[fine-art photography]], drawings and sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fine art moves from gallery to the Web|url = http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_25032838/fine-art-moves-from-gallery-web|website = www.mercurynews.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company counts clients in every U.S. state and over 45 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stephen Tanenbaum, small business expert, on small business radio program, The Small Business Advocate Show|url = http://www.smallbusinessadvocate.com/small-business-experts/stephen-tanenbaum-101120|website = www.smallbusinessadvocate.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as 1.7&amp;nbsp;million social followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UGallery (ugallery)|url = https://www.pinterest.com/ugallery/|website = Pinterest|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UGallery.com|url = http://facebook.com/Ugallery|website = facebook.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UGallery (@UGallery) {{!}} Twitter|url = https://twitter.com/UGallery|website = twitter.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UGallery (@ugallery) • Instagram photos and videos|url = http://instagram.com/ugallery/|website = instagram.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
UGallery was an early entrant to the business of selling original art online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Artist's Toolbox: 30+ Places to Promote Your Art|url = http://mashable.com/2007/09/18/artists-toolbox/|website = Mashable|accessdate = 2015-11-13|first = Patric Herber2007-09-19 02:37:17|last = UTC}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, many art critics questioned the concept. A 2007 [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]] article called "the online art marketplace as mottled as a [[Claude Monet|Monet]] water scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = A Work in Progress: Buying Art on the Web|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119197772816454170|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-11-13|issn = 0099-9660|first = Kelly|last = Crow}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, the online art market was valued at $870&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hiscox Report: Online Art Trade 2013|url = http://www.arttactic.com/market-analysis/art-markets/us-a-european-art-market/559-hiscox-report-online-art-trade-2013.html?Itemid=102|website = www.arttactic.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the estimated value of the online art market grew to $2.64&amp;nbsp;billion, accounting for 4.8% of the estimated $55.2&amp;nbsp;billion value of the global art market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hiscox Online Art Trade Report 2015|url = http://www.arttactic.com/market-analysis/art-markets/us-a-european-art-market/699-hiscox-online-art-trade-report-2015.html?Itemid=102|website = www.arttactic.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150905030328/http://www.arttactic.com/market-analysis/art-markets/us-a-european-art-market/699-hiscox-online-art-trade-report-2015.html?Itemid=102|archivedate = September 5, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:War. The Exile and the Rock Limpet.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''War. The Exile and the Rock Limpet'']]
'''''War. The Exile and the Rock Limpet''''' is an [[oil painting]] of 1842 by the English [[Romanticism|Romantic]] painter [[J. M. W. Turner]] (1775 - 1851). Intended to be a companion piece to Turner's ''Peace. Burial at Sea'', ''War'' is a painting that depicts a moment from [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s exile at [[Saint Helena]]. In December 1815, the former Emperor was taken by the British government to the [[Longwood House]], despite its state of disrepair, to live in captivity; during his final years of isolation, Napoleon had fallen into despair. Turner's decision to pair the painting with ''Peace'' was heavily criticized when it was first exhibited but it is also seen as predecessor to his more famous piece ''[[Rain, Steam and Speed – The Great Western Railway]]'' (1844).

== Background ==

At the conclusion of his [[Hundred Days]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who suffered a decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in June 1815, had fallen under the custody of the British after considering a bid for an escape to the United States. In December, the former Emperor was exiled to [[Saint Helena]] in the South Atlantic and housed under guard in the [[Longwood House]], his situation worsened by the building's poor living conditions. Without any realistic hopes of escape from Saint Helena, Napoleon lived out his final days on the island until his death in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/travel/st-helena-cursed-rock-of-napoleons-exile.html|title=St. Helena, ‘Cursed Rock’ of Napoleon’s Exile|author=Mancini, Anthony|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. M. W. Turner]] was often inspired by conflicts from the Napoleonic era: his works ''[[The Battle of Trafalgar (painting)|The Battle of Trafalgar]]'' (1807) and ''[[The Fighting Temeraire]]'' are realizations of the artist's influences. Political overtones also are found in some of Turner's most famous pieces, including ''[[Snow Storm: Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps]]'' (1832). In 1840, Napoleon's ashes were returned to France for a state burial on request by [[Louis Philippe I]], inspiring Turner to make the former Emperor the subject of ''War. The Exile and the Rock Limpet''.&lt;ref name=napoleon&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.napoleon.org/en/history-of-the-two-empires/paintings/war-the-exile-and-the-rock-limpet/|title=War. The Exile and the Rock Limpet|publisher=Napoleon.org|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''War'' depicts a moment during Napoleon's exile on St. Helena. While on guard of a British sentry, a prevalent reminder of his captivity, Napoleon bows slightly to study a lone rock limpet. In his portrayal of him, Turner sought to embody the futility of war.&lt;ref name=reinvent&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YT1FbAVI59AC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=war+the+exile+and+the+rock+limpet&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi20t6qoZHTAhVLzoMKHZZRCsIQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=war%20the%20exile%20and%20the%20rock%20limpet&amp;f=false|title=Reinventing Allegory|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=Kelley, Theresa|year=1997|pages=210-211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sunset behind the figure -- Turner's "sea of blood" as he described it -- symbolizes the past hardships of war experienced during Napoleon's military campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-war-the-exile-and-the-rock-limpet-n00529|title=The Artist and the Emperor|publisher=[[Tate]]|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''War'' debuted at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] besides Turner's other artwork ''Peace. Burial at Sea'' in 1842. ''Peace'' commemorates Turner's friend Scottish artist [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] who, while on a return voyage from the [[Far East]], died of an illness in 1841. Like its companion piece, ''War'' was painted on a smaller canvas and was exhibited in an octagonal frame design. Together, ''War'' and ''Peace'' contrast the heroic figure that was Napoleon with Wilkie's lonely [[burial at sea]]. However, ''War'' fared poorly with critics who questioned Turner's decision to pair it with ''Peace'', widely considered the better of the two pieces.&lt;ref name=reinvent/&gt; Turner's abstract approach to ''War'' is noted as an early stepping stone toward his more well-received painting ''[[Rain, Steam and Speed – The Great Western Railway]]'' (1844).&lt;ref name=napoleon/&gt;

The '''Warlis''' or ''Varli''s are an [[indigenous people|indigenous]] [[tribe]] or [[Adivasi]]s, living in mountainous as well as coastal areas of [[Maharashtra]]-[[Gujarat]] border and surrounding areas. They have their own [[animistic]] beliefs, life, customs and traditions, as a result of [[acculturation]] they have adopted many [[Hindu belief]]s. The Warlis speak an unwritten Varli language which belong to the southern zone of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]].

[[File:Warli painting in Warli.JPG|thumb|right|300 px|A painting on a wall of a Warli house, depicting a ''Devchauk'' at the centre and two ''Lagnachauk''s on both the sides]]

==Demographics==
Warlis are found in [[Jawhar]], Mokhada, [[Dahanu]] and [[Talasari]] talukas of the northern [[Thane district]], parts of [[Nashik district|Nashik]] and [[Dhule district|Dhule]] districts of [[Maharashtra]], [[Valsad]], [[Dang District, India|Dangs]], [[Navsari]] and [[Surat]] districts  of [[Gujarat]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_st_gujarat.pdf Census of India 2001, The Scheduled Tribes of Gujarat]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[union territory|union territories]] of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]] and [[Daman and Diu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_st_dnh.pdf Census of India 2001, The Scheduled Tribes of Dadra and Nagar Haveli]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Warli speak in [[Varli language]],  classified as [[Marathi–Konkani languages|Konkani]], with some degree
of influence from [[Gujrati language|Gujarati]].

Warli language is classified under Marathi by Grierson (Grierson's Linguistic Survey of India) as well as A.M. Ghatage (Warli of Thana, vol.VII of A Survey of Marathi dialects)

==Warli painting==
{{Main article|Warli painting}}
[[File:Painted prayers, Warli paintings, at Sanskriti Kendra, Anandagram, New Delhi.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Warli paintings, at [[Sanskriti Kendra Museum]], Anandagram, New Delhi.]] 
In the book ''The Painted World of the Warlis'' [[Yashodhara Dalmia]] claimed that the Warlis carry on a tradition stretching back to 2500 or 3000 BCE. Their mural paintings are similar to those done between 500 and 10,000 BCE in the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], in [[Madhya Pradesh]].

Everything about Warli is earthy and soothing. It takes you back to the painting’s provenance where you could almost smell the wet soil, feel the touch of the calloused hand that painted the background and admire meticulous brush stroke of the rural artist who created the master piece. Warli paintings succeed in adding elegance to a rural hut or a five star hotel lobby with the same charm.

No wonder, designers were so enthralled by this art form, that they decided to create an entire line of dresses based on Warli paintings. Designers have used very traditional patterns, rich and folksy colours to recreate the magic of Warli  paintings in her dresses.

Their extremely rudimentary wall paintings use a very basic graphic vocabulary: a circle, a triangle and a square.Their paintings were monosyllabic. The circle and triangle come from their observation of nature, the circle representing the sun and the moon, the triangle derived from mountains and pointed trees. Only the square seems to obey a different logic and seems to be a human invention, indicating a sacred enclosure or a piece of land. So the central motive in each ritual painting is the square, known as the "chauk" or "chaukat", mostly of two types: ''Devchauk'' and ''Lagnachauk''. Inside a ''Devchauk'', we find [[Palaghata]], the mother goddess, symbolizing fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tribhuwan |first1=Robin D.|last2=Finkenauer|first2=Maike|title=Threads Together: A Comparative Study of Tribal and Pre-historic Rock Paintings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBXdIQVeIS0C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=Dev+Chowk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9f3CTKHMAou4vgO_ncDOCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Dev%20Chowk&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|location=Delhi|isbn=81-7141-644-6|pages=13-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, male gods are unusual among the Warli and are frequently related to spirits which have taken human shape. The central motive in these ritual paintings is surrounded by scenes portraying hunting, fishing and farming, festivals and dances, trees and animals. Human and animal bodies are represented by two triangles joined at the tip; the upper triangle depicts the trunk and the lower triangle the pelvis. Their precarious equilibrium symbolizes the balance of the universe, and of the couple, and has the practical and amusing advantage of animating the bodies.

The pared down pictorial language is matched by a rudimentary technique. The ritual paintings are usually done inside the huts. The walls are made of a mixture of branches, earth and cow dung, making a [[Red Ochre]] background for the wall paintings. The Warli use only white for their paintings. Their white pigment is a mixture of rice paste and water with gum as a binding. They use a bamboo stick chewed at the end to make it as supple as a paintbrush. The wall paintings are done only for special occasions such as weddings or harvests. The lack of regular artistic activity explains the very crude style of their paintings, which were the preserve of the womenfolk until the late 1970s. But in the 1970s this ritual art took a radical turn, when [[Jivya Soma Mashe]] and his son [[Balu Mashe]] started to paint, not for any special ritual, but because of his artistic pursuits. Warli painting also featured in Coca-Cola's 'Come home on Diwali' ad campaign in 2010 was a tribute to the spirit of India’s youth and a recognition of the distinct lifestyle of the Warli tribe of Western India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/article/press-releases/coca-cola-india-celebrates-ancient-warli-folk-art-form-launches-110101200123_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribal Cultural Intellectual Property==
[[Warli Painting]] is cultural intellectual property of the tribal community. Today, there is an urgent need for preserving this traditional knowledge in tribal communities across the globe. Understanding the need for intellectual property rights, tribal non-profit Organisation "Adivasi Yuva Seva Sangh" initiated efforts to start a registration process in 2011. Now, Warli Painting is registered with a [[Geographical Indication]] under the intellectual property rights act. With the use of technology and the concept of social entrepreneurship, Tribals established the Warli Art Foundation, a non-profit company dedicated to Warli art and related activities.

'''''Welcome to Eltingville''''' is an [[animated]] [[comedy]] [[Pilot episode|pilot]] created by [[Evan Dorkin]] based on his comic book series ''[[Eltingville (comics)|Eltingville]]''. It was premiered in the United States on March 3, 2002, on [[Cartoon Network]]'s late night programming block, [[Adult Swim]], but was not picked up for a full series.

''Welcome to Eltingville'' takes place in [[Eltingville, Staten Island|Eltingville]], [[Staten Island]], and focuses on the lives of four teenage boys: Bill Dickey, Josh Levy, Pete DiNunzio and Jerry Stokes, all members of "The Eltingville Club", who have shared interests in comic books and science fiction, among other things. In the pilot episode Bill and Josh enter into a fight over a collectible [[Boba Fett]] action figure.

The pilot episode, "Bring Me the Head of Boba Fett", adapts the Eisner Award winning story of the same name, which ran in the third issue of ''[[Instant Piano]]''.&lt;ref name=EA1&gt;{{cite web|title=1996 Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner96.php|publisher=Hahn Library Comic Book Awards Almanac|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was written by Dorkin and [[Chuck Sheetz]] and received a positive reception. It has been made available on DVD.

== Plot ==
The Eltingville Club's members, Bill Dickey, Josh Levy, Pete DiNunzio and Jerry Stokes, all get into a fight while playing ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'', wake up Bill's mom and Bill kicks Josh out of the club. The next day, Bill awakes from a nightmare which he called a "freaky premonition," and decides to let Josh back into the club. They end their day at a comic book shop, where Bill and Josh compete in a trivia contest to win an [[action figure]] of [[Boba Fett]]. While Bill technically wins, they continue their dispute, wreaking havoc in the process. They both race home to steal their parents money, and race back to the store. Meanwhile, Pete and Jerry debate if Boba Fett is still alive after the events of ''[[Return Of The Jedi]]''. Bill and Josh bribe the clerk, Joe, with a check and credit cards respectively. He denies both forms of currency. They continue arguing and end up breaking the action figure. They need to combine their funds to purchase the broken toy and all four are then kicked out of the store. Bill angrily walks away with Fett's head and leaves Josh with the body. While Josh weeps on the ground, Jerry tells Pete, "Well, if Boba Fett wasn't dead before, he sure as hell is now." Willoughby ends the episode by breaking the [[fourth wall]], asking if this is the "end of the Eltingville Club?!"

== Production and broadcast ==
The pilot episode, "Bring Me the Head of Boba Fett", was written by [[Evan Dorkin]] and directed by [[Chuck Sheetz]]. It was rated as [[TV Parental Guidelines#TV-14|TV-14]] in the United States for comic violence, crude sexual references (including sexualized depictions of women), and moderate offensive language. Production on the episode was officially completed in October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Worley|first1=Rob M.|title=Cartoon Net Suits Decide Fate of Eltingville Club|url=http://www.mania.com/cartoon-net-suits-decide-fate-bieltingville-clubib_article_87556.html|publisher=Mania.com|accessdate=15 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714212439/http://www.mania.com/cartoon-net-suits-decide-fate-bieltingville-clubib_article_87556.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot was based on Dorkin's time as a comic book store employee at Jim Hanley's Universe in Eltingville, Staten Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arrant|first1=Chris|title=Evan Dorkin's BEASTS Collected, Soon to Meet HELLBOY|url=http://www.newsarama.com/5515-evan-dorkin-s-beasts-collected-soon-to-meet-hellboy.html|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot's story line was partially based upon the comic story of the same name and the pilot's theme opening and closing [[theme music|themes]] were written and performed by [[The Aquabats]].

Dorkin took a large role in the pilot's creation and has since stated that if he could have re-done the episode, he would have chosen to delegate more work and to choose an ''Eltingville'' story that would show off more of the series' potential and characters.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arrant|first1=Chris|title=Evan Dorkin Lampoons The Dark Side of Comic Fandom In ELTINGVILLE CLUB Finale|url=http://www.newsarama.com/20534-evan-dorkin-lampoons-the-dark-side-of-comic-fandom-in-eltingville-club-finale.html|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the series had been picked up for further episodes or a miniseries, potential plot lines for episodes would have included a "Klingon vs. Elf war" between a local Klingon camp and a Renaissance fair, as well as the club members digging through the Staten Island landfill for a collectible item that was mistakenly thrown out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Worley|first1=Rob|title=THE FUTURE OF 'ELTINGVILLE' ON TV AND IN COMICS|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=895|publisher=CBR|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilot episode was originally aired in the United States on Cartoon Network's late night programming block [[Adult Swim]] on March 3, 2002, and was originally promoted by "[[Television special|special]]" by Adult Swim. It has since been re-aired periodically on Adult Swim since its original premiere, including twice on [[Halloween|Halloween night]], October 31, 2008, as part of an advertised "Halloween Stunt" night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fritz|first=Steve|title=Animated Shorts: Max Atoms' Swan Song - 'Underfist'|url=http://www.newsarama.com/tv/100809-Ani-Shorts-Underfist.html|publisher=Newarama.com|accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Girls playing video games in Japan.jpg|thumb|Women playing ''[[The House of the Dead III]]'' in an [[amusement arcade]] in [[Video gaming in Japan|Japan]], 2005.]]

The relationship between '''women and video games''' has received extensive academic, corporate, and social attention. Since the 1990s,&lt;ref name=polygonNoGirls /&gt; female [[gamer]]s have commonly been regarded as a minority, but industry surveys have shown that in time the gender ratio has become closer to equal, and since the 2010s, women have been found to make up about half of all gamers. [[Sexism in video gaming]], including [[sexual harassment]] and the [[Gender representation in video games|underrepresentation of women as characters in games]], is an increasing topic of discussion in [[video game culture]].

Advocates for increasing the number of female gamers stress the problems attending disenfranchisement of women from one of the fastest-growing cultural realms as well as the largely untapped nature of the female gamer market. Efforts to include greater female participation in the medium have addressed the problems of gendered advertising, social stereotyping, and the lack of female video game creators (coders, [[Video game developer|developers]], producers, etc.). The term "'''girl gamer'''" has been used as a [[Reappropriation|reappropriated term]] for female players to describe themselves, but it has also been criticized as counterproductive or offensive.

== Demographics of female players ==
{{See also|Video game#Demographics}}
Female participation in gaming is increasing. According to a [[Entertainment Software Association]] survey, women players in the United States increased from 40% in 2010 to 48% in 2014.&lt;ref name="wsjWomenHalf"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gaming-no-longer-a-mans-world-1408464249|title=Women Now Make Up Almost Half of Gamers|first1=Sven|last1=Grundberg|first2=Jens|last2=Hansegard|date=20 August 2014|publisher=|via=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washpoMoreWomen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/22/adult-women-gamers-outnumber-teenage-boys/|title=Study: More women than teenage boys are gamers|date=August 22, 2014|first=Gail |last=Sullivan|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, despite the dominant perception that most gamers are men,&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015" /&gt; the ratio of female to male gamers is balanced, mirroring [[Human sex ratio|the population at large]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/adult-women-largest-gaming-demographic/?fb=ss&amp;prtnr=nerdist|title=Adult women are now the largest demographic in gaming|last=Romano|first=Aja|date=2014|website=The Daily Dot|publisher=Nicholas White|access-date=September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a [[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] study found that among teens, 65% of men and 35% of women describe themselves as daily gamers. This trend was found to be stronger the younger the age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Lenhart | first=Amanda | last2=Kahna | first2=Joseph | last3=Middaugh | first3=Ellen | last4=Macgill | first4=Alexandra Rankin | last5=Evans | first5=Chris | last6=Vitak | first6=Jessica | date=16 September 2008 | title=Teens, Video Games, and Civics | publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] | publication-place=Washington D.C. | url=http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2008/PIP_Teens_Games_and_Civics_Report_FINAL.pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that while adult men are significantly more likely to play [[Console game|console games]] than adult women, on other platforms they are equally likely to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Lenhart | first=Amanda | last2=Jones | first2=Sydney | last3=Macgill | first3=Alexandra Rankin | date=7 December 2008 | title=Pew Internet Project Data Memo | publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] | url=http://www.pewinternet.org/~/media//Files/Reports/2008/PIP_Adult_gaming_memo.pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even in this area, the numbers are moving towards equality: in 2013, [[Nintendo]] reported that half of its users were women,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.geekwire.com/2013/dudes-38-xbox-users-female-51-kids/ |title= Not just dudes: 38% of Xbox users female, 51% have kids |publisher= Geek Wire |year= 2013 |accessdate= 2013-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015 another Pew study found that more American women (42%) than men (37%) owned video game consoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frank|first1=Allegra|title=New survey findings show more women own game consoles than men|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/11/4/9669110/pew-research-center-female-gamers-statistics|accessdate=6 November 2015|work=Polygon|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that female participation increased with age (61% of women and 57% of men aged 45 to 64 played games).&lt;ref name=variety2013&gt;{{citation |url= https://variety.com/2013/digital/features/womengamers1200683299-1200683299/ |title= Videogame Biz: Women Still Very Much in the Minority |publisher= Variety |year= 2013 |accessdate= 2013-10-20 |author= Marc Graser }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid-2015 survey reported by UKIE indicates that 42% of UK gamers are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ukie.org.uk/sites/default/files/cms/UK%20Games%20Industry%20Fact%20Sheet%2026%20January%202016.pdf |title= UK Video Games Fact Sheet |publisher= The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment |date= 26 August 2016 |accessdate= 8 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Data collection ===
In North America, national demographic surveys have been conducted yearly by the U.S. [[Entertainment Software Association]] (ESA){{efn|The ESA was known as the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) prior to 16 July 2003.}} since at least 1997, and the Canadian [[Entertainment Software Association of Canada]] (ESAC) since 2006. Other organizations including the Australian/New-Zealander [[Interactive Games &amp; Entertainment Association]] (IGEA) since 2005 collect and publish demographic data on their constituent populations on a semi-regular basis. In Europe, the regional [[Interactive Software Federation of Europe]] (ISFE) and numerous smaller national groups like the [[Belgian Entertainment Association]] (BEA), the [[Nederlandse Vereniging van Producenten en Importeurs van beeld- en geluidsdragers]] (NVPI), and the Association for UK Interactive Entertainment (UKIE) have also begun to collect data on female video gamers since 2012. One-off market research studies and culture surveys have been produced by a wide variety of other sources including some segments of [[video game journalism|the gaming press]] and other culture writers since the 1980s as well.

Not only has the general female gaming population been tracked, but the spread of this population has been tracked over many facets of gaming. For more than 10 years, groups like the ESA and ESAC have gathered data on the gender of video game purchasers, the percentage of women gamers within certain age brackets, and the average number of years women gamers have been gaming. The ESAC in particular has gone into great depth reporting age-related segmentation of the market between both male and female gamers. Other statistics have been collected from time to time on a wide variety of facets influencing the video game market.

=== Historical prevalence ===
*The author of ''[[Pac-Man]]'', [[Toru Iwatani]], attempted to appeal to a wider audience—beyond the typical demographics of young boys and teenagers. His intention was to attract girls to arcades because he found there were very few games that were played by women at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021|title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man|first=Chris|last=Morris|date=March 3, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Electronic Games'' reported in 1982 that it was "the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of women as players";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Worley|first=Joyce|title=Women Join the Arcade Revolution|journal=[[Electronic Games]]|date=May 1982|volume=1|issue=3|pages=30–33 [33]|url=https://archive.org/stream/electronic-games-magazine-1982-05/Electronic_Games_Issue_03_Vol_01_03_1982_May#page/n31/mode/2up|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the nine arcade games that ''How to Win Video Games'' (1982) discussed, ''Pac-Man'' was the only one with women as a majority of players.&lt;ref name="howtowin"&gt;{{Cite book |title=How to Win Video Games |publisher=Pocket Books |year=1982 |isbn=0-671-45841-8 |pages=82-90 | url=https://archive.org/stream/book_how_to_win_video_games#page/n81/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the sequel [[Ms. Pac-Man]], launched in 1981, featured a female protagonist.
*In May 1982, sociologist Sidney J. Kaplan reported the composition of [[arcade video game]] players to be roughly 80% male and 20% female.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Sidney J. "The Image of Amusement Arcades and Differences in Male and Female Video Game Playing". ''[[The Journal of Popular Culture]]''. Vol.17. Pp.93–98. June 1983. {{ISSN|0022-3840}} (Presented as "Amusement Arcades: Video Games and Differences in Male and Female Participation" before the [[North Central Sociological Association]]. Detroit Michigan. May 1982 annual meeting.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''How to Win Video Games'' estimated that men were 95% of ''[[Defender (video game)|Defender]]'' and 90% of ''[[Omega Race]]'' players, while women were half the players of ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and three other games.{{r|howtowin}}
*In 1983, researcher John W. Trinkaus published findings that there were 8 male players to every 3 female players in video game arcades.&lt;ref&gt;Trinkaus, John. W. "Arcade Video Games: An Informal Look", ''[[Psychological Reports]]''. Vol.52, No.2. Pg.586. 1983. {{ISSN|0033-2941}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leroux, Yvan and Michel Pépin. "Jeu Sur Micro-Ordinateur et Différences Liées au Sexe". ''[[Revue des Sciences de l'Education]]''. Vol.XII, No.2. Pp.173-196. 1986. {{ISSN|0318-479X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1983, a [[Coleco]] executive stated at the [[Boston Computer Society]] that the target audience for the new [[Coleco Adam|Adam]] home computer, based on its [[ColecoVision]] console, was "boys age 8 to 16 and their fathers. We believe those are the two groups that really fuel computer purchases". When audience members booed, he added that the marketing strategy was based on consumer research.&lt;ref name="coleco19830928"&gt;{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg_I9TGYM-w |title=Coleco Presents The Adam Computer System |date=2016-05-03 |publisher=YouTube |orig-year=1983-09-28 |time=44:30 |quote=We're doing that with five new television commercials, which have just been completed, and which will be shown in conjunction with the Adam launch date. These commercials are each directed to our target audience, which is composed of our friendly neighborhood children, boys age 8 to 16 and their fathers. We believe those are the two groups that really fuel computer purchases, [boos] and we've directed right at 'em [more boos] - oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Women, we've a commercial for you, trust me, but the key point is that our research, which is consumer research, directed that thought [inaudible] from the research, and we've directed our commercials at that target user group.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1988, Epyx CEO [[David Shannon Morse]] stated that ''[[California Games]]'' was the first game from his company to appeal equally to boys and girls during [[playtesting]].&lt;ref name="compute198809"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-09-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_100_1988_Sep#page/n11/mode/2up | title=Epyx Grows with David Morse | work=Compute! | date=September 1988 | accessdate=November 10, 2013 |author1=Ferrell, Keith |author2=Keizer, Gregg | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1988, ''[[Playthings (magazine)|Playthings]]'' reported that among primary video game users, women represented 21% of all gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Main |first = Peter |title= Column: How high is up for video games? (forecast for 1989) |publisher= [[Playthings (magazine)|Playthings]] |date = 1 October 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1988, a study by [[Nintendo]] reported that 27% of [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] players in the United States were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/06Kahle001551#page/n7/mode/2up|title=Video Game: Past, Present and Future. An Industry Overview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 1993 self-reported survey by ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' found that 7% of its readers were female.&lt;ref name="cgw199304"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=105 | title=What You've Been Playing Lately | work=Computer Gaming World | date=1993-04-01 | accessdate=7 July 2014 | page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1994, a survey by ''[[Electronic Games]]'' reported that, among American women gamers, the [[Sega Genesis]] was most popular, with 75% ownership, followed by the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] with 58.3% ownership, the [[Game Boy]] with 58%, and [[MS-DOS]] with 50%.&lt;ref&gt;''Electronic Games'', issue 23 (August 1994), pages 36-42&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1997, Mattel, Inc. released [[Barbie Fashion Designer]], selling over 600,000 copies. The game was considered an important step in advancing an interest in the design of games for women.&lt;ref name="Dickey2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dickey|first1=Michele D.|title=Girl gamers: the controversy of girl games and the relevance of female-oriented game design for instructional design|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|volume=37|issue=5|year=2006|pages=785–793|issn=00071013|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8535.2006.00561.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1998, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' stated that the video game market for young girls was "exploding" with titles such as ''[[The American Girls Premiere]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8460578.html|title=VIRTUAL EQUALITY?

=== Self-identification as gamers ===
While 48% of women in the United States report having played a video game, only 6% identify as [[gamer]]s, compared to 15% of men who identify as gamers.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/attitudes-about-video-games/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=Gaming and Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rises to 9% among women aged 18–29, compared to 33% of men in that age group. Half of female [[Pc game|PC gamers]] in the U.S. consider themselves to be [[Gamer#Dedication spectrum|core or hardcore gamers]].&lt;ref name="pcgamerFemale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/researchers-find-that-female-pc-gamers-outnumber-males/|title=Researchers find that female PC gamers outnumber males|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="superdataWhyAll"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/why-all-gamers-matter/|title=SuperData Research - Games data and market research  » Why ALL gamers matter — my view as a female games analyst|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 a [[EEDAR]] survey found that nearly 60 percent of female gamers played on mobile devices and that 63 percent of these female mobile gamers played online multiplayer mobile games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vg247.com/2012/10/03/nearly-60-of-mobile-gamers-are-women-says-analyst/ | title= Nearly 60% of mobile gamers are women, says analyst|publisher=Vg247.com|accessdate=2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connotations of "gamer" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label.&lt;ref name="nytimesShunLabel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/technology/personaltech/women-who-play-games-shun-gamer-label.html|last=McPhate|first=Mike|work=The New York Times|title=Women Who Play Games Shun 'Gamer' Label}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Girl gamers" or "gamer girls" is a label for women who regularly play games. While some critics have advocated use of the label as a [[Reappropriation|reappropriated term]],&lt;ref name=hex /&gt; others have described the term as unhelpful,&lt;ref name=ng /&gt;&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; offensive, and even harmful or misleading.

There are considerable differences between the [[video game genre]]s preferred, on average, by women and men. According to a 2017 report by the video game analytics company Quantic Foundry, based on surveys of about 270,000 gamers, the following proportions of gamers within a genre are women or men, respectively:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yee|first1=Nick|title=Beyond 50/50: Breaking Down The Percentage of Female Gamers By Genre|url=http://quanticfoundry.com/2017/01/19/female-gamers-by-genre/|website=Quantic Foundry|accessdate=20 January 2017|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While male audiences prefer fast-paced explosive action and combat,&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; women tend to prefer in-game communication&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; and interpersonal relationships (character development and plot dynamics).&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; Women have also been shown to prefer [[role-playing video game]]s to first-person shooters,&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; and [[Thomas W. Malone]] of Stanford University found that girls preferred to play a [[Hangman (game)|Hangman]] video game over a darts simulation that boys enjoyed.&lt;ref name="malone198112"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-12/1981_12_BYTE_06-12_Computer_Games#page/n259/mode/2up | title=What Makes Computer Games Fun? | work=BYTE | date=December 1981 | accessdate=12 August 2015 | author=Malone, Thomas W. | pages=258–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In-game activities may also differ between the sexes in games with less linear plots such as the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]]. Women are often characterized as preferring story-driven games or constructive games like ''[[The Sims]]'' or ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'', but this is not universally true.&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt; In 2013, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that thirty percent of women were playing more violent games. Of this 30%, 20% played [[Call of Duty]] and 15% played [[Grand Theft Auto]].&lt;ref name=variety2013/&gt; There has been persistent female interest in [[action-adventure game]]s and [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPGs]] like ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and ''[[Second Life]]''.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; Compared to men, female MMORPG players tend to place more emphasis on socialization relative to achievement-oriented play. This emphasis on socialization extends beyond just the game itself: In a study published in the ''Journal of Communication'' in 2009, researchers found that 61% of female MMORPG players played with a romantic partner, compared to 24% of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Dmitri|last1=Williams|first2=Mia|last2=Consalvo|first3=Scott|last3=Caplan|first4=Nick|last4=Yee|title=Looking for Gender: Roles and Behaviors Among Online Gamers|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2009|volume=59|issue=4|pages=700–725|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2009.01453.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data collected by Quantic Foundry in 2016, the primary motivations why people play video games differ, on average, by gender. While men frequently want most to compete with others and destroy things, women often want most to complete challenges and immerse themselves in other worlds:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yee|first1=Nick|title=7 Things We Learned About Primary Gaming Motivations From Over 250,000 Gamers|url=http://quanticfoundry.com/2016/12/15/primary-motivations/|website=Quantic Foundry|accessdate=20 January 2017|date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While video games and advertising were initially gender-neutral, advertising began to narrow its focus to young boys as a [[target market]] following the [[video game crash of 1983]].&lt;ref name="polygonNoGirls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed|last=Lien|first=Tracey|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|title=No Girls Allowed|date=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adaNotGamers"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="overlandBrendan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://overland.org.au/previous-issues/issue-218/feature-brendan-keogh/|title=Hackers, gamers and cyborgs|publisher=overland.org.au|date= Autumn 2015|first= Brendan|last=Keogh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although commercial hits such as ''[[Myst]]'' and ''The Sims'' appealed to women, these were nonetheless seen by some as being outside the gaming mainstream. Critic [[Ian Bogost]] opined, "We're looking at where there isn't diversity and we're saying those games are the most valid games."&lt;ref name="polygonNoGirls" /&gt; Industry studies on the lack of women in gaming have also suffered at times from biases of interpretation. Kevin Kelly of [[Joystiq]] has suggested that a high degree of [[circular reasoning]] is evident when male developers use focus groups and research numbers to determine what kinds of games girls play. After making a bad game that targets those areas suggested by the marketing research, the game's lack of popularity among both genders is often attributed to the incorrect prejudice that "girls don't play games" rather than the true underlying problems such as poor quality and playability of the game. Whereas market data and research are important to reveal that markets exist, argues Kelly, they shouldn't be the guiding factor in how to make a game that appeals to girls.&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt; The argument has also been advanced that emphasis on market research is often skewed by the participants in the study. In studies on male gamers of the baby boomer generation, for example, players displayed a marked aversion to violence. The incorrect conclusion that could be drawn from this result—that men dislike violent games—may also be comparable to incorrect conclusions drawn from some female-oriented gaming studies.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; It has been suggested that developers can learn what girls want in a game by observing similarities in how different girl teams will react to and modify a game if given the opportunity.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt;

[[File:Casio-Loopy-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|The [[Casio Loopy]], created by [[Casio]] and released in October 1995 in Japan, was unique in that the marketing for it was completely targeted to female gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Leah B.|title=Man Sets Guinness World Record for Largest Game Collection|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/24/man-sets-guinness-world-record-for-largest-game-collection|publisher=[[IGN.com]]|accessdate=11 February 2018|date=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the past, "[[girl games]]" have frequently been created by adapting girl-oriented material in other media like ''[[The Baby-sitters Club]]'', ''[[Barbie]]'', and ''[[Nancy Drew]]''&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; while leaving male-targeted genres such as sport and driving sims, role playing games, and first person shooters to the boys.&lt;ref name=yap /&gt; This has begun to change, however, with the expansion of entrepreneurial feminism and the concept of "games by girls for girls" that has been embraced by companies such as [[Her Interactive]], [[Silicon Sisters]] and [[Purple Moon]]—all video gaming start ups that are female owned and largely female staffed. Creating games designed with regard to sociological, psychological, and cognitive research into girls' cultural interests, such companies hope to awaken a female-only market emphasizing fundamental differences between what girls want and what boys want in gaming.&lt;ref name=nzegwu /&gt; The movement to expand the existing market to include women through the development of gender-neutral games has also had a number of advocates. Critics have proposed that female gamers, especially older female gamers&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; prefer gender-neutral games such as ''[[Tetris]]'', ''[[Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?]]'', or the ''[[King's Quest]]'' games to "girl games".&lt;ref name=brown /&gt;&lt;ref name=yap /&gt;

In examining game play habits at [[Internet café]]s, South Korea has seen a rise in female gamers publicly playing games such as ''[[Lineage (video game)|Lineage]]'', while in other Asian countries this kind of public female gaming has remained rare; similarly, games such as ''[[Tamagotchi]]'' are seen as a gender neutral in Japan, but have been regarded as girls' games in the West.&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt; In other cases, female trends in one country may be indicators of associated changes in others, as in the case of a rising number of female ''Lineage'' players in Korea having led to increased number of female ''Lineage'' players in Taiwan. In Japan the rise of [[Kawaii|cute culture]] and its associated marketing has made gaming accessible for girls, and this trend has also carried over to Taiwan and recently China (both countries previously having focused mostly on [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMOs]] and where parents usually place harsher restrictions on daughters than on sons).&lt;ref name=dillon /&gt;

== Skill levels ==
An aspect of game design that has been identified as negatively impacting female interest is the degree of expertise with gaming conventions and familiarity with [[Game controller|game controls]] required to play the game.&lt;ref name=spark /&gt; In-game tutorials have been found to bring both sexes into games faster,&lt;ref name=kelly /&gt; and new controllers such as Nintendo's [[Wii Remote]], Microsoft's [[Kinect]], and the [[Game controller#Variants|various rhythm game controllers]] have affected demographics by making games easier to pick up and by providing a level playing-field.&lt;ref name=spark /&gt; This trend has continued through the efforts of [[Nintendo]] in its release of the [[Wii]].&lt;ref name=watts&gt;Watts, Steve. ''[http://www.1up.com/news/report-suggests-female-gaming-rise Report Suggests Female Gaming on the Rise] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023055758/http://www.1up.com/news/report-suggests-female-gaming-rise |date=2013-10-23 }}''.

In a 2016 study published in the ''Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication,'' researchers found that, after controlling for confounds such as the amount of play time and guild membership, women players advance at least as fast as men do in two MMOs, [[EverQuest II]] and [[cmn:剑侠情缘网络版III|Chevaliers' Romance III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shen|first=Cuihua|last2=Ratan|first2=Rabindra|last3=Cai|first3=Y.

=== Male behavior towards female gamers ===
{{Main|Sexism in video gaming}}
A 2015 study found that lower-skilled male players of ''[[Halo 3]]'' were more hostile towards teammates with a female voice, but behaved more submissively to players with a male voice. Higher-skilled male players, on the other hand, behaved more positively towards female players. The authors argued the male hostility towards female gamers in terms of [[evolutionary psychology]], writing, "female-initiated disruption of a male hierarchy incites hostile behaviour from poor performing males who stand to lose the most status".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0131613|pmid=26176699|title=Insights into Sexism: Male Status and Performance Moderates Female-Directed Hostile and Amicable Behaviour|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=7|pages=e0131613|year=2015|last1=Kasumovic|first1=Michael M.|last2=Kuznekoff|first2=Jeffrey H.|pmc=4503401|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1031613K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top female players in [[Esports|competitive gaming]] mainly get exposure in female-only tournaments, including such games as ''[[Counter-Strike]]'', ''[[Dead or Alive 4]]'', and ''[[StarCraft II]]''. Canadian ''StarCraft II'' player [[Sasha Hostyn]] (Scarlett) first gained notoriety in the open qualifiers of IGN ProLeague 4, where she defeated top-tier Korean players. She is well known for being one of the few non-Korean players who can play at the same skill level as male Korean players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/esports/sasha-scarlett-hostyn-starcraft-esports/|title=Meet Scarlett, the 20-year-old woman who's blazing trails in 'StarCraft'|website=The Daily Dot|publisher=dailydot.com|date=21 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161029105206/http://www.dailydot.com/esports/sasha-scarlett-hostyn-starcraft-esports/|archivedate=29 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[Street Fighter x Tekken]]'' player ArisBakhtanians commented on the lack of female players in the community, saying "[[sexual harassment]] is part of a culture, and if you remove that from the fighting game community, it's not the fighting game community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/02/is-pervasive-sexism-holding-the-professional-fighting-game-community-back/|title=Is pervasive sexism holding the professional fighting game community back?|publisher=ARS Technica|author=Kyle Orland|date=29 Feb 2012|accessdate=27 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologized for his comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/women-are-gamers-but-largely-absent-from-e-sports/|title=Women are gamers, but largely absent from "e-sports"|publisher=ARS Technica|author=Casey Johnston|date=18 Feb 2014|accessdate=27 Dec 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, organizers for a ''[[Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft|Hearthstone]]'' tournament in Finland were criticized for limiting registrations to male players only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/02/hearthstone-heroes-warcraft-tournament-ban-female-finland|title=Hearthstone gaming tournament bans women players – ignites 'sexism' row|publisher=theguardian.com|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the tournament being an offline qualifier for the IeSF World Championship, with its ''Hearthstone'' tournament only open to male players. The winner of the Finnish qualifier would risk not being eligible to participate in the main event if that player were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/07/02/hearthstone-tournament/|title=Hearthstone tournament explains why women aren't allowed to play [updated]|publisher=pcgamer.com|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IeSF organization ultimately removed the male-only restriction from all of their tournaments, and in turn the Finnish qualifier that originally sparked the controversy also removed this restriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2014/07/03/iesf-removes-male-only-restriction-from-its-e-sports-tournaments/|title=IeSF removes male-only restriction from its e-sports tournaments|publisher=pcgamer.com|date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support groups for women in the video game industry ===

==== WIGSIG (Women In Games Special Interest Group) ====
WIGSIG is a special interest group of IDGA (International Game Developers Association). The group was formed in order to foster a positive impact on the game industry regarding gender balance in the workplace and/or marketplace. It provides a community, resources, and opportunities for people in the gaming industry. It also works to assess the numbers of the women in the games industry and tracks the changes of these numbers over time. Additionally, it works to recruit women into the games industry and make the field more attractive to women while providing them with the support and connections they need to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.igda.org/about/ |title=About &amp;#124; WIGSIG |publisher=Women.igda.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women in Games International ====
Founded in 2005, Women in Games International (WIGI), made up of both female and male professionals, works to promote the inclusion and advancement of women in the global games industry.
WIGI promotes diversity in video game development, publishing, media, education and workplaces, based on a fundamental belief that increased equality and camaraderie among genders can make global impacts for superior products, more consumer enjoyment and a stronger gaming industry.
Women In Games International stands as strong advocates for issues crucial to the success of women and men in the games industry, including a better work/life balance, healthy working conditions, increased opportunities for success and resources for career support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getwigi.com/ |title=missionstatement |publisher=getwigi.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getwigi.com|title=WIGI Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== WIGJ (Women In Games Jobs) ====
WIGJ is a group that works to recruit, preserve, and provide support for the advancement of women in the games industry by positively and energetically endorsing female role models and providing encouragement and information to women interested in working in the gaming field.  The group was incorporated under the UK's [[Companies Act 2006]] on June 2, 2011 as a "not for profit" or Community Interest Company. Companies in the game development industry have, in recent years, been seeking to balance the gender ratios on development teams and consoles like the [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS]] have seen increased numbers of female players.  In addition to using this growing interest in women in the game developing industry, WIGJ works to put more women in traditional game development with less stigma attached to them.  WIGJ seeks to help women find their place within the growing and rewarding field of game development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womeningamesjobs.com |title=(WIGJ) for more women in gaming |publisher=Womeningamesjobs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women in video game streaming ==

The relationship between women and [[video game live streaming]] has been a rocky one. As streaming services such as YouTube and Twitch became increasingly popular, female gamers began to jump on board. Many notable streamers arose from this streaming revolution including Hafu, Glitterlanced, and Sovitia.

Geneviève Forget, a video game streamer, states in a Kotaku interview that "Harassment does happen in my stream chat from time to time that people start discussing my appearance but it really isn't the focus on my stream. I'd like to think people come back to watch it because it is quite entertaining and I try to interact with the chat as much as possible."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = They're Attractive, They're Women, And They Play Games Live On The Internet. But They're Not 'Camwhores.'|url = http://kotaku.com/5982137/theyre-attractive-theyre-women-and-they-play-games-live-on-the-internet-but-theyre-not-camwhores|website = Kotaku|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female streamers are most often criticized for purportedly using services like Twitch as an alternative to soft-core cam websites to solicit donations by performing sexually suggestive acts. Many male gamers, who dominate the industry, correlate female streamers' success to this behavior. Vivyan Andrew, a 29-year-old twitch streamer addresses this in an interview with Kotaku, ""Yes, if you're a woman and you're streaming, the misconceptions are that you're seeking attention and/or trying to use your 'assets' to receive donations. The misconceptions are very superficial as they invalidate the streamer as a person and what she has to offer beyond her appearance."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Terence Chiang of MMOs.com, writes, "gaming as a 'male hobby' seems to be integrated into our society, with the computer and technology areas commonly being seen as 'Masculine'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Girl Gamers in Streaming and eSports|url = http://mmos.com/editorials/girl-gamers-in-streaming-and-esports|website = MMOs.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This social integration makes the acceptance of female entry into gaming as a legitimate pastime difficult. Research has found that 52% of the gaming world is made up of women,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 52% of gamers are women – but the industry doesn't know it {{!}} Meg Jayanth|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/18/52-percent-people-playing-games-women-industry-doesnt-know|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most remain less visible in the context of the dominant culture, due to the stereotypes between masculinity and gaming.

== Gender disparity ==
{{See also|Gender representation in video games}}

Critics attribute the seeming lack of female interest in video games to the negative [[portrayal of women in video games]] and to [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] attitudes common among professional and hardcore gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/misc/22786_To_My_Someday_Daughter.html|author=Geordie Tait|title=To My Someday Daughter|publisher=Starcitygames.com|accessdate=2015-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 [[Twitter]] discussion among women working in games, collated under the [[hashtag]] ''#1reasonwhy'', argued that sexist practices such as the oversexualization of female characters, disinterest in topics that matter to women, as well as workplace harassment and unequal pay for men and women were common in the games industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Locker|first=Melissa|title=#1ReasonWhy: Women Take to Twitter to Talk about Sexism in Video Game Industry|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/27/1reasonwhy-women-take-to-twitter-to-talk-about-sexism-in-video-game-industry/|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=[[TIME magazine]]|date=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=Luke|title=Here's a Devastating Account of the Crap Women in the Games Business Have to Deal With.

Regarding elements of game design, areas such as gameplay, mechanics, and similar features have been described as gender neutral, however presentational aspects of games have been identified as strongly gender-linked. Specifically, gaming is often seen as fantasy and escapism in which empathy and identification with the character is much more easily achieved if the character shares the same gender as the player.&lt;ref name=hex&gt;[[Stephanie Bendixsen|Bendixsen, Stephanie 'Hex']].

[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]. 16 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Gamers of both genders tend to crave realism and the more realistic the gender of the character, the easier it is for a player to identify with the character.&lt;ref name=ng&gt;Ng, Amy.

GameSpot. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; When female characters do appear in video games, they are often regarded as presenting unhealthy messages concerning unrealistic body images and provocative sexual and violent behaviors for players of both genders.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Lucy.

[[Stuff.co.nz]]. 9 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypical female behaviors such as giggling or sighing are often presented non-ironically, and this leads young children (especially girls who identify with the female character) to think that this is how girls are supposed to look and act.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20030805000714/http://abcnews.go.com/sections/tech/DailyNews/videogamestudy001214.html Not a Pretty Picture]''.

''[http://www.joystiq.com/2007/03/21/sxsw-getting-girls-into-the-game-designing-and-marketing-games SXSW: Getting Girls Into The Game: Designing and Marketing Games for Female Players]''.

Although some of the population of male gamers have been the source of [[Sexual harassment in video gaming|harassment towards female gamers]] and over-sexualization of the characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallace|first=Amanda|title=Your Argument is Invalid: Harassment Against Female Gamers|url=http://www.gameskinny.com/b0zks/your-argument-is-invalid-harassment-against-female-gamers|publisher=Game Skinny|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are many men in the gaming industry who agree that there is a problem with female over-sexualization in gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meixsell|first=Jesse|title=Female sexualization in gaming: a male gamer's perspective|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/04/14/female-sexualization-in-gaming-a-male-gamers-perspective/|publisher=Games Beat|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also male gamers who argue that some of the sexualization of women in video games also applies to men in video games and that portraying a man or woman in a video game in a sexual way can be acceptable if done in the right context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pleasure|first=Crymson Pleasure|title=He said what?

A study in the ''Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media'' said that women who play a lot of video games disagree more with stereotypes concerning gender in gaming and are more strongly drawn towards specific gaming genres than men, regardless of the men's gaming frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vermeulen|first=Lotte|last2=Looy|first2=Jan Van|date=2016-04-02|title="I Play So I Am?"

=== Effects ===
The concept that [[video games as art|video games are a form of art]] is one that has begun to gain force in the later half of the 2000s with the U.S. [[National Endowment for the Arts]] recognizing games as a form of art in May 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/109835-Games-Now-Legally-Considered-an-Art-Form-in-the-USA | title= Games Now Legally Considered an Art Form (in the USA) | first = John | last = Funk | date = 2011-05-06 | accessdate = 2011-05-06 | publisher = [[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example. In viewing video games as [[cultural artifact]]s and the industry as a cultural industry, the disenfranchisement of women from the medium is regarded as negatively impacting the female voice in the industry and the woman's capacity to take part in the cultural dialogue that gaming inspires.&lt;ref name=spark&gt;Young, Nora &amp; Misener, Dan.

''[[Spark (radio show)|Spark]]''. 7 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; From an education perspective, certain [[Video game genres|gaming genres]] particularly lacking in female players such as the [[first-person shooter]] game have been shown to increase spatial skills thereby giving advantages to players of the games that are currently skewed along gender lines.&lt;ref name=spark /&gt; Video games have also been determined to provide an easy lead-in to computer literacy for children and correlations have been drawn between male video gaming and the predominance of male workers within the computer industry.&lt;ref name=nzegwu&gt;Nzegwu, Uzoamaka. ''[http://fubini.swarthmore.edu/~WS30/WS30F2000/compvideo.html Gender and Computer/Video games]''. [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]]. 15 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing importance of tech jobs in the 21st century and the increased role of online networking, the lack of female video game players suggests a loss of future career opportunities for women.&lt;ref name=spark /&gt;

=== Responses ===
The majority of the people who work on game development teams are men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burrows|first=Leah|title=Women remain outsiders in video game industry|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/01/27/women-remain-outsiders-video-game-industry/275JKqy3rFylT7TxgPmO3K/story.html|work=The Boston Globe|publisher=Globe Correspondent|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have identified that one of the best ways to increase the percentage of female players comes from the aspect of authorship (either in-game as with ''[[Neopets]]'' and ''[[Whyville]]'', or indirectly as with the [[List of Harry Potter related topics#Video games based on the books and films|''Harry Potter'' series]]' inclusion of Hermione as a playable character subsequent to fan requests).&lt;ref name=dillon&gt;Dillon, Beth A.

In addressing the future of the medium, many researchers have argued for the improvement of the gaming industry to appeal to a more general gender-neutral audience and others have suggested that the appeal should be directed to women in particular.&lt;ref name=hex /&gt;&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rosen, Jill|title=The gender divide: video-gaming has been largely a man's- or boy's- world, but with games by and for women, that's starting to change|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=September 2008|location=Maryland|page=C1|type=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest attempts to broaden the market to include women could be seen in [[Sega]]'s&lt;ref name=hamilton /&gt; use of the increased number of female protagonists in fighting games.&lt;ref name=nzegwu /&gt; Other examples of this include games like ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'', ''[[Remember Me (video game)|Remember Me]]'', and ''[[the Last of Us]]'', which include a female option for the main character.&lt;ref name="Dewitt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dewitt|first=James|title=Lara Croft and the Future of Women in Videogames|url=http://www.thunderboltgames.com/opinion/lara-croft-and-the-future-of-women-in-videogames|publisher=Thunderboltgames.com|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to use strong female characters in important roles, however, is often met with skepticism by marketers concerned with sales.&lt;ref name="Dring"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dring|first=Christopher|title="Women are the future of gaming" - how Tomb Raider and co have put females back on the agenda|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/women-are-the-future-of-gaming/0111714|publisher=Mcvuk.com|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examination of IGN's [[Big Games]] at [[E3 2012]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/e3/Big_Games_at_E3_2012|title=Big Games at E3 2012 - E3 - Electronics Entertainment Expo Wiki Guide - IGN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Big Games]] at [[E3 2013]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/e3/Big_Games_at_E3_2013|title=Big Games at E3 2013 - E3 - Electronics Entertainment Expo Wiki Guide - IGN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows growth of the female protagonist in video games, rising 4% from 2012 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, Kyle.
