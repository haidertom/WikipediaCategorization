'''Aerospace bearings''' are the bearings installed in [[aircraft]] and [[aerospace]] systems including commercial, private, military, or space applications.

Materials include M50 tool steel (AMS6491), carbon chrome steel (AMS6444), the corrosion resistant AMS5930, 440C stainless steel, silicon nitride (ceramic) and titanium carbide-coated 440C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bearing steels: into the 21st century|author1=J. J. C. Hoo|author2=Willard B. Green|pages=355–358|publisher=ASTM International|year=1998|isbn=0-8031-2421-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, special attention is given to the material specification, non-destructive testing, and to the traceability of the bearing (a system of documents that enables an engineer to trace a bearing, typically back to its manufacturing batch and material supply).

==Design==
When designing aerospace bearings, it is important to take a few things into account, including:

*material standard
*design
*[[lubrication]] type
*surface coatings and treatments
*non-destructive testing
*traceability

In order to assure bearing performance, it is necessary for the bearing steel to be of high quality. Jet engine bearings are typically manufactured from metals manufactured using a vacuum arc remelt to enable material requirements to be met.

Jet engine shaft bearings and accessory drive shaft bearings typically use single piece or two piece machined retainers. The pressed steel or moulded retainers found on mass-produced bearings are not used.

Temperature and moisture resistant oils, greases and lubricants are normally specified.  If the lubricant is not correct the performance of the bearing will be compromised.

==Application==
In jet engines bearings can operate at over 200 degrees Celsius (400 °F) and at speeds over 10,000 rpm for the turbine shafts to over 30,000 rpm in the accessory drives. In wing control surface applications temperatures as low as {{convert|-55|C|F|0}} may be encountered.

==Monitoring==
Bearings are a vital factor in many products and assemblies and their performance is often monitored continuously. In jet engines the oil supply is monitored to detect the presence of metallic debris that could identify a failure either of the bearings or of other components whose failure may contaminate the bearings.

'''Carroll University''' is located in Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA. Established in 1846, Carroll was Wisconsin's first four-year institution of higher learning. Carroll University is a private [[liberal arts college]] affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]].  Before July 1, 2008, Carroll University was known as '''Carroll College'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=749962|title=Carroll change approved|author=Scott Williams|work=jsonline.com|accessdate=3 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518125423/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=749962|archivedate=18 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to its establishment, Carroll was known as Prairieville Academy, which was founded in 1841. Its charter—named for [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]—was passed into law by the [[Wisconsin Territory#Legislature|Wisconsin Territorial Legislature]] on January 31, 1846.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} During the 1860s, the [[American Civil War]] and financial difficulty caused Carroll to temporarily suspend operations. The Board of Trustees voted unanimously to change the institution's name to Carroll University, effective July 1, 2008.

== Academics ==
Carroll University offers more than 95 areas of study at the [[undergraduate]] level, with master's degrees and certificates in selected subjects, as well as one clinical doctorate program in physical therapy.

There are 133 full-time and 258 part-time faculty members. 71.4% of the faculty have terminal degrees. As of September 2015, Carroll serves 3,521 students at the full- and part-time undergraduate and graduate levels. These students represent 33 states and 31 countries.

==Campus==
The campus is home to a variety of nineteenth and early twentieth century historical buildings, including Sneeden House (a 1922 colonial home now used as a guesthouse and conference center) and MacAllister Hall (a renovated, 19th-century mansion that now houses offices for the CFO, English, modern language, computational and physical sciences, chemistry, and the Division of Arts and Sciences).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://thedigitalnp.com/2010/10/26/macallister-history-haunts/ MacAllister: A History of Haunts]"&lt;/ref&gt; The school provides housing in six residence halls, six apartment buildings, and two houses.

The full campus stretches 132.8 acres, with the Main Campus around 50 acres, a four-acre Center for Graduate Studies located three minutes south of [[Interstate 94]], a six-acre property southwest of campus and a 64-acre field research station in [[Genesee, Wisconsin]].

==Traditions==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}

===Bagpipes===
Since the 1960s, bagpipes have been a part of Carroll’s opening convocation and commencement ceremony. Freshmen are escorted to their first assembly by a lone bagpiper, and upon graduation are led to commencement by a band of [[bagpipes]]. The rite of passage symbolizes Carroll’s connection to its [[Presbyterian]] roots; early 19th-century Scottish immigrants settled in Waukesha, then known as Prairieville.

===Ring the bell===
A longstanding Carroll sports tradition, “Ring the Bell” is a ceremony performed by Carroll varsity teams following a win, when members athletes ring the school victory bell located at the northwest corner of Schneider Stadium. All teams participate—football, soccer, lacrosse—as long as the game is played and won at Schneider. In 2016 the victory bell was repainted and updated to feature the new Carroll Pioneers logo.

== Athletics ==
Carroll University's athletic teams, known as the Pioneers, participate in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] and compete in 11 men's and 11 women's sports in the [[College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin]].  Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis and track &amp; field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

===Football===
: ''See [[List of Carroll Pioneers head football coaches]]''
The [[college football]] program at Carroll began in the late 1890s.  Past head coaches include [[Glenn Thistlethwaite]], [[Vince DiFrancesca]], and [[Matty Bell]].  The current coach is [[Mark Krzykowski]], who replaced [[Henny Hiemenz]] after the 2010 season.

On September 5, 1906, Carroll became the site of a milestone event in [[American football]] when [[Saint Louis University]] player [[Bradbury Robinson]], coached by [[Eddie Cochems]], threw the first legal [[forward pass]] in football history (though it was first used experimentally in the [[1905 Washburn vs. Fairmount football game]]).

===Basketball===
In 2006, both the men's and women's basketball teams qualified for the NCAA Division III tournament for the first time in school history. The women won the Midwest Conference tournament and received the automatic bid, while the men's team received an "at-large" bid. Both were eliminated in the first round of play.

In 2007, both teams again qualified for the tournament. The Pioneers won the Midwest Conference tournament, during which freak power outages forced the championship game to be delayed and moved twice, first to [[Monmouth College]], then to nearby [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]]. Upon reaching the NCAA tournament, they defeated 7th-ranked [[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College]] in the first round of play, and 5th-ranked [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]], to advance to the "Sweet Sixteen" sectional level. The women received an at-large bid to the tournament, defeating [[Illinois Wesleyan University]] in the first round, but losing in the second round to 25th-ranked [[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]].

In 2012, Carroll returned to the NCAA tournament, making it to the second round after defeating ranked [[Transylvania University]].

==Media==
* ''Century Magazine'', Carroll University's annual literary magazine, publishes art, photography, prose, and poetry created by Carroll students.
* ''[[The New Perspective]]'' is the official student-operated college newspaper.
* [[WCCX-FM]] is the official student-operated radio station.
* MWCTV is the official broadcast home for athletic events.

==Rankings==
In 2017, Carroll was ranked 38th in Midwest Regional Colleges by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' on its list of America's Best Colleges.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/carroll-university-3838 | work=U.S.News &amp; World Report  | title=Regional University Rankings }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked Carroll #532 among 660 colleges in the United States.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;"[https://www.forbes.com/colleges/carroll-university/ America's Top Colleges Ranking 2015: Carroll University]". ''Forbes'', July 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also gave Carroll a B financial grade.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;

In cell biology, the '''Celada-Seiden model''' is a logical description at the inter-[[cell (biology)|cell]]ular level of the mechanisms making up the [[Adaptation|adaptive]] immune [[humoral]] and cellular response to a genetic [[antigen]].

The computational counterpart of the Celada-Seiden model is the [[IMMSIM]] code.

'''Chaos theory''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] focusing on the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s that are highly sensitive to [[initial conditions]]. "Chaos" is an interdisciplinary theory stating that within the apparent randomness of [[chaotic complex system]]s, there are underlying patterns, constant [[feedback loops]], repetition, [[self-similarity]], [[fractals]], [[self-organization]], and reliance on programming at the initial point known as ''sensitive dependence on initial conditions''. The [[butterfly effect]] describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state, e.g. a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a hurricane in Texas.&lt;ref name="bo1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://geoffboeing.com/2015/03/chaos-theory-logistic-map/ |author = Boeing |title = Chaos Theory and the Logistic Map |date = 2015 |accessdate = 2015-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small differences in initial conditions, such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation, yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Kellert |first = Stephen H. |title = In the Wake of Chaos: Unpredictable Order in Dynamical Systems |publisher = University of Chicago Press |year = 1993 |isbn = 978-0-226-42976-2 |page = 32 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens even though these systems are [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]], meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no [[randomness|random]] elements involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellert|1993|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellert|1993|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WerndlCharlotte"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Werndl, Charlotte |title = What are the New Implications of Chaos for Unpredictability? |journal = The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume = 60 |issue = 1 |pages = 195–220 |year = 2009 |url = http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/60/1/195 |doi = 10.1093/bjps/axn053 |arxiv = 1310.1576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior is known as '''deterministic chaos''', or simply '''chaos'''.

==Introduction==
Chaos theory concerns deterministic systems whose behavior can in principle be predicted. Chaotic systems are predictable for a while and then 'appear' to become random.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems" /&gt; The amount of time that the behavior of a chaotic system can be effectively predicted depends on three things: How much uncertainty can be tolerated in the forecast, how accurately its current state can be measured, and a time scale depending on the dynamics of the system, called the [[Lyapunov time]]. Some examples of Lyapunov times are: chaotic electrical circuits, about 1 millisecond; weather systems, a few  days (unproven); the solar system, 50 million years. In chaotic systems, the uncertainty in a forecast increases [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] with elapsed time. Hence, mathematically, doubling the forecast time more than squares the proportional uncertainty in the forecast. This means, in practice, a meaningful prediction cannot be made over an interval of more than two or three times the Lyapunov time. When meaningful predictions cannot be made, the system appears random.&lt;ref&gt;''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Steven Strogatz, Hyperion, New York, 2003, pages 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chaotic dynamics==
[[File:Chaos Sensitive Dependence.svg|thumb|The map defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''y'' → (''x'' + ''y)'' [[Modulo operation|mod]] 1&lt;/span&gt; displays sensitivity to initial x positions. Here, two series of ''x'' and ''y'' values diverge markedly over time from a tiny initial difference.]]
In common usage, "chaos" means "a state of disorder".&lt;ref&gt;Definition of {{linktext|chaos}} at [[Wiktionary]];&lt;/ref&gt; However, in chaos theory, the term is defined more precisely. Although no universally accepted mathematical definition of chaos exists, a commonly used definition originally formulated by [[Robert L. Devaney]] says that, to classify a dynamical system as chaotic, it must have these properties:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A First Course in Dynamics: With a Panorama of Recent Developments|last=Hasselblatt|first=Boris|author2=Anatole Katok|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58750-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# it must be sensitive to initial conditions
# it must be [[topological mixing|topologically mixing]]
# it must have [[dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbit]]s

In some cases, the last two properties in the above have been shown to actually imply sensitivity to initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Elaydi, Saber N. |title=Discrete Chaos |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-58488-002-8 |page=117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Basener, William F. |title=Topology and its applications |publisher=Wiley |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-471-68755-9 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, while it is often the most practically significant property, "sensitivity to initial conditions" need not be stated in the definition.

If attention is restricted to [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]], the second property implies the other two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vellekoop, Michel |author2=Berglund, Raoul |title=On Intervals, Transitivity = Chaos |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=353–5 |date=April 1994 |jstor=2975629 |doi=10.2307/2975629}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative, and in general weaker, definition of chaos uses only the first two properties in the above list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Medio, Alfredo |author2=Lines, Marji |title=Nonlinear Dynamics: A Primer |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-521-55874-7 |page=165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chaos as a spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry ===
{{Main|Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics}}In continuous time dynamical systems, chaos is the phenomenon of the spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry which is an intrinsic property of evolution operators of all stochastic and deterministic (partial) differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 2016|title=Introduction to Supersymmetric Theory of Stochastics|journal=Entropy|volume=18|issue=4|pages=108|doi=10.3390/e18040108|author=Ovchinnikov, I.V.|arxiv = 1511.03393 |bibcode = 2016Entrp..18..108O }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=Topological supersymmetry breaking: Definition and stochastic generalization of chaos and the limit of applicability of statistics|journal=Modern Physics Letters B|volume=30|issue=8|pages=1650086|doi=10.1142/S021798491650086X|author1=Ovchinnikov, I.V.|author2=Schwartz, R. N.|author3=Wang, K. L.|bibcode = 2016MPLB...3050086O |arxiv=1404.4076}}&lt;/ref&gt; This picture of dynamical chaos works not only for deterministic models but also for models with external noise, which is an important generalization from the physical point of view because in reality all dynamical systems experience influence from their stochastic environments. Within this picture, the long-range dynamical behavior associated with chaotic dynamics, e.g., the [[butterfly effect]], is a consequence of the [[Goldstone's theorem]] in the application to the spontaneous topological supersymmetry breaking.

===Sensitivity to initial conditions===
{{Main|Butterfly effect}}
[[File:SensInitCond.gif|thumb|Lorenz equations used to generate plots for the y variable. The initial conditions for ''x'' and ''z'' were kept the same but those for ''y'' were changed between '''1.001''', '''1.0001''' and '''1.00001'''. The values for &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; were '''45.92''', '''16''' and '''4 ''' respectively. As can be seen, even the slightest difference in initial values causes significant changes after about 12 seconds of evolution in the three cases. This is an example of sensitive dependence on initial conditions.]]
'''Sensitivity to initial conditions''' means that each point in a chaotic system is arbitrarily closely approximated by other points with significantly different future paths, or trajectories. Thus, an arbitrarily small change, or perturbation, of the current trajectory may lead to significantly different future behavior.

Sensitivity to initial conditions is popularly known as the "[[butterfly effect]]", so-called because of the title of a paper given by [[Edward Lorenz]] in 1972 to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in Washington, D.C., entitled ''Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?''. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events that prevents the predictability of large-scale phenomena. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the overall system would have been vastly different.

A consequence of sensitivity to initial conditions is that if we start with a limited amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable. This is most prevalent in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead.&lt;ref name="RGW"&gt;{{cite book |author=Watts, Robert G. |title=Global Warming and the Future of the Earth |publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool |year=2007 |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, this does not mean that we cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100&amp;nbsp;°C or fall to −130&amp;nbsp;°C on earth (during the current [[geologic era]]), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.

In more mathematical terms, the [[Lyapunov exponent]] measures the sensitivity to initial conditions. Given two starting [[trajectory|trajectories]] in the [[phase space]] that are infinitesimally close, with initial separation &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathbf{Z}_0&lt;/math&gt;, the two trajectories end up diverging at a rate given by

:&lt;math&gt; | \delta\mathbf{Z}(t) | \approx e^{\lambda t} | \delta \mathbf{Z}_0 |,&lt;/math&gt;

where t is the time and λ is the Lyapunov exponent. The rate of separation depends on the orientation of the initial separation vector, so a whole spectrum of Lyapunov exponents exist. The number of Lyapunov exponents is equal to the number of dimensions of the phase space, though it is common to just refer to the largest one. For example, the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE) is most often used because it determines the overall predictability of the system. A positive MLE is usually taken as an indication that the system is chaotic.

Also, other properties relate to sensitivity of initial conditions, such as [[Measure (mathematics)|measure-theoretical]] [[Mixing (mathematics)|mixing]] (as discussed in [[ergodicity|ergodic]] theory) and properties of a [[Kolmogorov automorphism|K-system]].&lt;ref name="WerndlCharlotte" /&gt;

===Topological mixing===
[[File:LogisticTopMixing1-6.gif|thumb|Six iterations of a set of states &lt;math&gt;[x,y]&lt;/math&gt;  passed through the logistic map. (a) the blue plot (legend 1) shows the first iterate (initial condition), which essentially forms a circle. Animation shows the first to the sixth iteration of the circular initial conditions. It can be seen that ''mixing'' occurs as we progress in iterations. The sixth iteration shows that the points are almost completely scattered in the phase space. Had we progressed further in iterations, the mixing would have been homogeneous and irreversible. The logistic map has equation &lt;math&gt;x_{k+1} = 4  x_k  (1 - x_k )&lt;/math&gt;. To expand the state-space of the logistic map into two dimensions,  a second state, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, was created as &lt;math&gt;y_{k+1} = x_k + y_k &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;x_k + y_k &lt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_{k+1} = x_k + y_k -1&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.]]
[[File:Chaos Topological Mixing.png|thumb|The map defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''y'' → (''x'' + ''y)'' [[Modulo operation|mod]] 1&lt;/span&gt; also displays [[topological mixing]]. Here, the blue region is transformed by the dynamics first to the purple region, then to the pink and red regions, and eventually to a cloud of vertical lines scattered across the space.]]

'''[[Topological mixing]]''' (or '''topological transitivity''') means that the system evolves over time so that any given region or [[open set]] of its [[phase space]] eventually overlaps with any other given region. This mathematical concept of "mixing" corresponds to the standard intuition, and the mixing of colored [[dye]]s or fluids is an example of a chaotic system.

Topological mixing is often omitted from popular accounts of chaos, which equate chaos with only sensitivity to initial conditions. However, sensitive dependence on initial conditions alone does not give chaos. For example, consider the simple dynamical system produced by repeatedly doubling an initial value. This system has sensitive dependence on initial conditions everywhere, since any pair of nearby points eventually becomes widely separated. However, this example has no topological mixing, and therefore has no chaos. Indeed, it has extremely simple behavior: all points except 0 tend to positive or negative infinity.

===Density of periodic orbits===
For a chaotic system to have [[Dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbits]] means that every point in the space is approached arbitrarily closely by periodic orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devaney|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x'')&lt;/span&gt; is one of the simplest systems with density of periodic orbits.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5+\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;→ &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{5-\sqrt{5}}{8}&lt;/math&gt; (or approximately 0.3454915&amp;nbsp;→ 0.9045085&amp;nbsp;→ 0.3454915) is an (unstable) orbit of period 2, and similar orbits exist for periods 4, 8, 16, etc. (indeed, for all the periods specified by [[Sharkovskii's theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alligood|Sauer|Yorke|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharkovskii's theorem is the basis of the Li and Yorke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li |first1=T.Y. |last2=Yorke |first2=J.A. |title=Period Three Implies Chaos |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=82 |pages=985–92 |year=1975 |url=http://pb.math.univ.gda.pl/chaos/pdf/li-yorke.pdf |format=PDF |author-link=Tien-Yien Li |doi=10.2307/2318254 |issue=10 |author2-link=James A. Yorke |bibcode=1975AmMM...82..985L |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229042210/http://pb.math.univ.gda.pl/chaos/pdf/li-yorke.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1975) proof that any continuous one-dimensional system that exhibits a regular cycle of period three will also display regular cycles of every other length, as well as completely chaotic orbits.

===Strange attractors===
[[File:TwoLorenzOrbits.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lorenz attractor]] displays chaotic behavior.  These two plots demonstrate sensitive dependence on initial conditions within the region of phase space occupied by the attractor.]]
Some dynamical systems, like the one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → 4 ''x'' (1 – ''x''),&lt;/span&gt; are chaotic everywhere, but in many cases chaotic behavior is found only in a subset of phase space. The cases of most interest arise when the chaotic behavior takes place on an [[attractor]], since then a large set of initial conditions leads to orbits that converge to this chaotic region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strelioff|first1=Christopher|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Medium-Term Prediction of Chaos|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|date=2006|volume=96|issue=4|pages=044101|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.044101|pmid=16486826|bibcode = 2006PhRvL..96d4101S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An easy way to visualize a chaotic attractor is to start with a point in the [[basin of attraction]] of the attractor, and then simply plot its subsequent orbit. Because of the topological transitivity condition, this is likely to produce a picture of the entire final attractor, and indeed both orbits shown in the figure on the right give a picture of the general shape of the Lorenz attractor.  This attractor results from a simple three-dimensional model of the [[Edward Lorenz|Lorenz]] weather system. The Lorenz attractor is perhaps one of the best-known chaotic system diagrams, probably because it was not only one of the first, but it is also one of the most complex and as such gives rise to a very interesting pattern that, with a little imagination, looks like the wings of a butterfly.

Unlike [[Attractor#Fixed point|fixed-point attractors]] and [[limit cycle]]s, the attractors that arise from chaotic systems, known as [[strange attractor]]s, have great detail and complexity.  Strange attractors occur in both [[continuous function|continuous]] dynamical systems (such as the Lorenz system) and in some [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] systems (such as the [[Hénon map]]). Other discrete dynamical systems have a repelling structure called a [[Julia set]], which forms at the boundary between basins of attraction of fixed points. Julia sets can be thought of as strange repellers. Both strange attractors and Julia sets typically have a [[fractal]] structure, and the [[fractal dimension]] can be calculated for them.

===Minimum complexity of a chaotic system===
[[File:LogisticMap BifurcationDiagram.png|thumb|right|[[Bifurcation diagram]] of the [[logistic map]] &lt;span style="white-space: nowrap;"&gt;''x'' → ''r'' ''x'' (1 – ''x'').&lt;/span&gt;  Each vertical slice shows the attractor for a specific value of ''r''.  The diagram displays [[Period-doubling bifurcation|period-doubling]] as ''r'' increases, eventually producing chaos.]]

Discrete chaotic systems, such as the logistic map, can exhibit strange attractors whatever their [[dimension]]ality. In contrast, for [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] dynamical systems, the [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] shows that a strange attractor can only arise in three or more dimensions.  [[Dimension (vector space)|Finite-dimensional]] [[linear system]]s are never chaotic; for a dynamical system to display chaotic behavior, it must be either [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] or infinite-dimensional.

The [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]] states that a two-dimensional differential equation has very regular behavior. The Lorenz attractor discussed below is generated by a system of three [[differential equation]]s such as:
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= \sigma y - \sigma x, \\
\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}t} &amp;= \rho x - x z - y, \\

While the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem shows that a continuous dynamical system on the Euclidean [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] cannot be chaotic, two-dimensional continuous systems with [[non-Euclidean geometry]] can exhibit chaotic behavior.&lt;ref name="Rosario 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosario|first=Pedro|title=Underdetermination of Science: Part I|date=2006|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1411693913}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps surprisingly, chaos may occur also in linear systems, provided they are infinite dimensional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A theory of linear chaos is being developed in a branch of mathematical analysis known as [[functional analysis]].

=== Jerk systems ===
In [[physics]], [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]] is the third derivative of [[position (vector)|position]], with respect to time.  As such, differential equations of the form
:: &lt;math&gt;J\left(\overset{...}{x},\ddot{x},\dot {x},x\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;
are sometimes called ''Jerk equations''. It has been shown that a jerk equation, which is equivalent to a system of three first order, ordinary, non-linear differential equations, is in a certain sense the minimal setting for solutions showing chaotic behaviour. This motivates mathematical interest in jerk systems. Systems involving a fourth or higher derivative are called accordingly hyperjerk systems.&lt;ref&gt;K. E. Chlouverakis and J. C. Sprott, Chaos Solitons &amp; Fractals 28, 739–746 (2005), Chaotic Hyperjerk Systems, http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pubs/paper297.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A jerk system's behavior is described by a jerk equation, and for certain jerk equations, simple electronic circuits can model solutions. These circuits are known as jerk circuits.

One of the most interesting properties of jerk circuits is the possibility of chaotic behavior. In fact, certain well-known chaotic systems, such as the Lorenz attractor and the [[Rössler map]], are conventionally described as a system of three first-order differential equations that can combine into a single (although rather complicated) jerk equation. Nonlinear jerk systems are in a sense minimally complex systems to show chaotic behaviour; there is no chaotic system involving only two first-order, ordinary differential equations (the system resulting in an equation of second order only).

An example of a jerk equation with nonlinearity in the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^3 x}{\mathrm{d} t^3}+A\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\mathrm{d} t^2}+\frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t}-|x|+1=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''A'' is an adjustable parameter. This equation has a chaotic solution for ''A''=3/5 and can be implemented with the following jerk circuit; the required nonlinearity is brought about by the two diodes:

[[File:JerkCircuit01.png|frameless|upright=1.4|center]]

In the above circuit, all resistors are of equal value, except &lt;math&gt;R_A=R/A=5R/3&lt;/math&gt;, and all capacitors are of equal size. The dominant frequency is &lt;math&gt;1/2\pi R C&lt;/math&gt;. The output of [[operational amplifier|op amp]] 0 will correspond to the x variable, the output of 1 corresponds to the first derivative of x and the output of 2 corresponds to the second derivative.

==Spontaneous order==
Under the right conditions, chaos spontaneously evolves into a lockstep pattern. In the [[Kuramoto model]], four conditions suffice to produce synchronization in a chaotic system.
Examples include the [[coupled oscillation]] of [[Christiaan Huygens]]' pendulums, fireflies, [[neuron]]s, the [[London Millennium Bridge]] resonance, and large arrays of [[Josephson junctions]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Strogatz, ''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Hyperion, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early proponent of chaos theory was [[Henri Poincaré]]. In the 1880s, while studying the [[three-body problem]], he found that there can be orbits that are nonperiodic, and yet not forever increasing nor approaching a fixed point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poincaré, Jules Henri |title=Sur le problème des trois corps et les équations de la dynamique.

Chaos theory began in the field of [[ergodic theory]]. Later studies, also on the topic of nonlinear [[differential equations]], were carried out by [[George David Birkhoff]],&lt;ref&gt;George D.

Despite initial insights in the first half of the twentieth century, chaos theory became formalized as such only after mid-century, when it first became evident to some scientists that [[linear theory]], the prevailing system theory at that time, simply could not explain the observed behavior of certain experiments like that of the [[logistic map]]. What had been attributed to measure imprecision and simple "[[Pseudorandom noise|noise]]" was considered by chaos theorists as a full component of the studied systems.

The main catalyst for the development of chaos theory was the electronic computer. Much of the mathematics of chaos theory involves the repeated [[iteration]] of simple mathematical formulas, which would be impractical to do by hand. Electronic computers made these repeated calculations practical, while figures and images made it possible to visualize these systems. As a graduate student in [[Chihiro Hayashi]]'s laboratory at Kyoto University, [[Yoshisuke Ueda]] was experimenting with analog computers and noticed, on November 27, 1961, what he called "randomly transitional phenomena".  Yet his advisor did not agree with his conclusions at the time, and did not allow him to report his findings until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abraham|Ueda|2001|loc=See Chapters 3 and 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sprott|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SEDjdjPZ158C&amp;pg=PA89 89]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Airplane vortex edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Turbulence]] in the [[Wingtip vortices|tip vortex]] from an [[airplane]] wing. Studies of the critical point beyond which a system creates turbulence were important for chaos theory, analyzed for example by the [[Soviet physicists|Soviet physicist]] [[Lev Landau]], who developed the [[Landau-Hopf theory of turbulence]]. [[David Ruelle]] and [[Floris Takens]] later predicted, against Landau, that [[fluid turbulence]] could develop through a [[strange attractor]], a main concept of chaos theory.]]

[[Edward Lorenz]] was an early pioneer of the theory. His interest in chaos came about accidentally through his work on [[meteorology|weather prediction]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=Lorenz1961&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lorenz, Edward N. |title=Deterministic non-periodic flow |journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |volume=20 |pages=130–141 |year=1963 |doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issue=2 |bibcode=1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]], to run his weather simulation. He wanted to see a sequence of data again, and to save time he started the simulation in the middle of its course. He did this by entering a printout of the data that corresponded to conditions in the middle of the original simulation. To his surprise, the weather the machine began to predict was completely different from the previous calculation. Lorenz tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny, and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have no practical effect. However, Lorenz discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Chaos: Making a New Science]] |last=Gleick |first=James |year=1987 |publisher=Cardinal |location=London|page=17|isbn=978-0-434-29554-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to [[Lorenz attractor]]s, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions.

In 1963, [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] found recurring patterns at every scale in data on cotton prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Benoît|last = Mandelbrot|year = 1963|title = The variation of certain speculative prices|journal = Journal of Business|volume = 36|pages = 394–419|doi = 10.1086/294632|issue = 4|jstor=2350970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beforehand he had studied [[information theory]] and concluded noise was patterned like a [[Cantor set]]: on any scale the proportion of noise-containing periods to error-free periods was a constant – thus errors were inevitable and must be planned for by incorporating redundancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Berger J.M. |author2=Mandelbrot B. | year = 1963 | title = A new model for error clustering in telephone circuits | journal = IBM Journal of Research and Development | volume = 7 |issue=3 | pages = 224–236 | doi=10.1147/rd.73.0224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot described both the "Noah effect" (in which sudden discontinuous changes can occur) and the "Joseph effect" (in which persistence of a value can occur for a while, yet suddenly change afterwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mandelbrot, B. |title=The Fractal Geometry of Nature |publisher=Freeman |location=New York |year=1977 |page=248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: {{cite book |last1=Mandelbrot |first1=Benoît B. |last2=Hudson |first2=Richard L. |title=The (Mis)behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=2004 |page=201 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This challenged the idea that changes in price were [[normal distribution|normally distributed]]. In 1967, he published "[[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|How long is the coast of Britain? Statistical self-similarity and fractional dimension]]", showing that a coastline's length varies with the scale of the measuring instrument, resembles itself at all scales, and is infinite in length for an [[infinitesimal]]ly small measuring device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mandelbrot |first=Benoît |title=How Long Is the Coast of Britain?

An object whose irregularity is constant over different scales ("self-similarity") is a [[fractal]] (examples include the [[Menger sponge]], the [[Sierpiński gasket]], and the [[Koch curve]] or ''snowflake'', which is infinitely long yet encloses a finite space and has a [[fractal dimension]] of circa 1.2619). In 1982, Mandelbrot published ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]'', which became a classic of chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mandelbrot, B.|title=The Fractal Geometry of Nature|date=1982|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0716711865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological systems such as the branching of the circulatory and bronchial systems proved to fit a fractal model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buldyrev |first1=S.V. |last2=Goldberger |first2=A.L. | last3=Havlin |first3=S. | authorlink3=Shlomo Havlin|last4=Peng |first4=C.K. | last5=Stanley | first5=H.E. |authorlink5=H.

In December 1977, the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] organized the first symposium on chaos, attended by David Ruelle, [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford|Robert May]], [[James A. Yorke]] (coiner of the term "chaos" as used in mathematics), [[Robert Shaw (physicist)|Robert Shaw]], and the meteorologist Edward Lorenz. The following year, independently [[Pierre Coullet]] and [[Charles Tresser]] with the article "Iterations d'endomorphismes et groupe de renormalisation" and [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] with the article "Quantitative Universality for a Class of Nonlinear Transformations" described logistic maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mitchell |last=Feigenbaum |title=Quantitative universality for a class of nonlinear transformations |journal=Journal of Statistical Physics |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=25–52 |date=July 1978 |doi=10.1007/BF01020332 |bibcode=1978JSP....19...25F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coullet, Pierre, and Charles Tresser. "Iterations d'endomorphismes et groupe de renormalisation." Le Journal de Physique Colloques 39.C5 (1978): C5-25&lt;/ref&gt;  They notably discovered the [[Universality (dynamical systems)|universality]] in chaos, permitting the application of chaos theory to many different phenomena.

In 1979, [[Albert J. Libchaber]], during a symposium organized in Aspen by [[Pierre Hohenberg]], presented his experimental observation of the [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] cascade that leads to chaos and turbulence in [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection]] systems. He was awarded the [[Wolf Prize in Physics]] in 1986 along with [[Mitchell J. Feigenbaum]] for their inspiring achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wolffund.org.il/cat.asp?id=25&amp;cat_title=PHYSICS|title = The Wolf Prize in Physics in 1986.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the New York Academy of Sciences co-organized with the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] and the [[Office of Naval Research]] the first important conference on chaos in biology and medicine. There, [[Bernardo Huberman]] presented a mathematical model of the [[eye tracking disorder]] among [[schizophrenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Bernardo Huberman |author=Huberman, B.A. |title=A Model for Dysfunctions in Smooth Pursuit Eye Movement |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=504 Perspectives in Biological Dynamics and Theoretical Medicine |pages=260–273 |date=July 1987 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1987.tb48737.x |bibcode = 1987NYASA.504..260H }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a renewal of [[physiology]] in the 1980s through the application of chaos theory, for example, in the study of pathological [[cardiac cycle]]s.

In 1987, [[Per Bak]], [[Chao Tang]] and [[Kurt Wiesenfeld]] published a paper in ''[[Physical Review Letters]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bak, Per; Tang, Chao; Wiesenfeld, Kurt |title=Self-organized criticality: An explanation of the 1/f noise |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=381–4 |date=27 July 1987 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.381 |bibcode=1987PhRvL..59..381B|last2=Tang |last3=Wiesenfeld }} However, the conclusions of this article have been subject to dispute. {{cite web|url=http://www.nslij-genetics.org/wli/1fnoise/1fnoise_square.html |title=? |work= |publisher= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214033929/https://www.nslij-genetics.org/wli/1fnoise/1fnoise_square.html |archivedate=2007-12-14 |df= }}.

Alongside largely lab-based approaches such as the [[Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld sandpile]], many other investigations have focused on large-scale natural or social systems that are known (or suspected) to display [[scale invariance|scale-invariant]] behavior. Although these approaches were not always welcomed (at least initially) by specialists in the subjects examined, SOC has nevertheless become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including [[earthquake]]s, (which, long before SOC was discovered, were known as a source of scale-invariant behavior such as the [[Gutenberg–Richter law]] describing the statistical distribution of earthquake sizes, and the [[Aftershock|Omori law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Omori, F. |title=On the aftershocks of earthquakes |journal=Journal of the College of Science, Imperial University of Tokyo |volume=7 |pages=111–200 |year=1894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describing the frequency of aftershocks), [[solar flare]]s, fluctuations in economic systems such as [[financial market]]s (references to SOC are common in [[econophysics]]), [[landscape formation]], [[forest fire]]s, [[landslide]]s, [[epidemic]]s, and [[biological evolution]] (where SOC has been invoked, for example, as the dynamical mechanism behind the theory of "[[punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibria]]" put forward by [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]). Given the implications of a scale-free distribution of event sizes, some researchers have suggested that another phenomenon that should be considered an example of SOC is the occurrence of [[war]]s. These investigations of SOC have included both attempts at modelling (either developing new models or adapting existing ones to the specifics of a given natural system), and extensive data analysis to determine the existence and/or characteristics of natural scaling laws.

In the same year, [[James Gleick]] published ''[[Chaos: Making a New Science]]'', which became a best-seller and introduced the general principles of chaos theory as well as its history to the broad public, though his history under-emphasized important Soviet contributions.{{citation needed|reason=No reason given for soviet under-emphasis|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gleick|first=James|title=Chaos: Making a New Science|date=August 26, 2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0143113454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the domain of a few, isolated individuals, chaos theory progressively emerged as a transdisciplinary and institutional discipline, mainly under the name of [[nonlinear system]]s analysis. Alluding to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s concept of a [[paradigm shift]] exposed in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962), many "chaologists" (as some described themselves) claimed that this new theory was an example of such a shift, a thesis upheld by Gleick.

The availability of cheaper, more powerful computers broadens the applicability of chaos theory.

A few categories are listed below with examples, but this is by no means a comprehensive list as new applications are appearing.

=== Cryptography ===
Chaos theory has been used for many years in [[cryptography]]. In the past few decades, chaos and nonlinear dynamics have been used in the design of hundreds of [[cryptographic primitive]]s. These algorithms include image [[encryption algorithms]], [[hash functions]], [[Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator|secure pseudo-random number generators]], [[stream ciphers]], [[Digital watermarking|watermarking]] and [[steganography]].&lt;ref name="Akhavan 1797–1813"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akhavan|first=A.|last2=Samsudin|first2=A.|last3=Akhshani|first3=A.|date=2011-10-01|title=A symmetric image encryption scheme based on combination of nonlinear chaotic maps|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016003211001104|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute|volume=348|issue=8|pages=1797–1813|doi=10.1016/j.jfranklin.2011.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these algorithms are based on uni-modal chaotic maps and a big portion of these algorithms use the control parameters and the initial condition of the chaotic maps as their keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behnia|first=S.|last2=Akhshani|first2=A.|last3=Mahmodi|first3=H.|last4=Akhavan|first4=A.|date=2008-01-01|title=A novel algorithm for image encryption based on mixture of chaotic maps|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077906004681|journal=Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals|volume=35|issue=2|pages=408–419|doi=10.1016/j.chaos.2006.05.011|bibcode = 2008CSF....35..408B }}&lt;/ref&gt; From a wider perspective, without loss of generality, the similarities between the chaotic maps and the cryptographic systems is the main motivation for the design of chaos based cryptographic algorithms.&lt;ref name="Akhavan 1797–1813"/&gt; One type of encryption, secret key or [[symmetric key]], relies on [[diffusion and confusion]], which is modeled well by chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Xingyuan|year=2012|title=An improved key agreement protocol based on chaos|journal=Commun.

=== Robotics ===
Robotics is another area that has recently benefited from chaos theory. Instead of robots acting in a trial-and-error type of refinement to interact with their environment, chaos theory has been used to build a [[Predictive modelling|predictive model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nehmzow|first=Ulrich|date=Dec 2005|title=Quantitative description of robot–environment interaction using chaos theory|journal=Robotics and Autonomous Systems|volume=53|issue=3–4|pages=177–193|doi=10.1016/j.robot.2005.09.009|author2=Keith Walker|url=http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/udfn/ftp/ecmrw3.pdf|access-date=2017-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812003513/http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/udfn/ftp/ecmrw3.pdf|archive-date=2017-08-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chaotic dynamics have been exhibited by [[Passive dynamics|passive walking]] biped robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goswami|first=Ambarish|year=1998|title=A Study of the Passive Gait of a Compass-Like Biped Robot: Symmetry and Chaos|journal=The International Journal of Robotics Research|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1282–1301|doi=10.1177/027836499801701202|author2=Thuilot, Benoit|author3=Espiau, Bernard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology===
For over a hundred years, biologists have been keeping track of populations of different species with [[population model]]s. Most models are [[continuous function|continuous]], but recently scientists have been able to implement chaotic models in certain populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eduardo|first=Liz|author2=Ruiz-Herrera, Alfonso|title=Chaos in discrete structured population models|journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems|year=2012|volume=11|issue=4|pages=1200–1214|doi=10.1137/120868980}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study on models of [[Canada lynx|Canadian lynx]] showed there was chaotic behavior in the population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lai|first=Dejian|title=Comparison study of AR models on the Canadian lynx data: a close look at BDS statistic|journal=Computational Statistics \&amp; Data Analysis|year=1996|volume=22|issue=4|pages=409–423|doi=10.1016/0167-9473(95)00056-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaos can also be found in ecological systems, such as [[hydrology]]. While a chaotic model for hydrology has its shortcomings, there is still much to learn from looking at the data through the lens of chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sivakumar|first=B|title=Chaos theory in hydrology: important issues and interpretations|journal=Journal of Hydrology|date=31 January 2000|volume=227|issue=1–4|pages=1–20|bibcode=2000JHyd..227....1S|doi=10.1016/S0022-1694(99)00186-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another biological application is found in [[cardiotocography]]. Fetal surveillance is a delicate balance of obtaining accurate information while being as noninvasive as possible. Better models of warning signs of [[Intrauterine hypoxia|fetal hypoxia]] can be obtained through chaotic modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bozóki|first=Zsolt|title=Chaos theory and power spectrum analysis in computerized cardiotocography|journal=European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology|date=February 1997|volume=71|issue=2|pages=163–168|doi=10.1016/s0301-2115(96)02628-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other areas===
In chemistry, predicting gas solubility is essential to manufacturing [[polymers]], but models using [[particle swarm optimization]] (PSO) tend to converge to the wrong points. An improved version of PSO has been created by introducing chaos, which keeps the simulations from getting stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Mengshan|author2=Xingyuan Huanga|author3=Hesheng Liua|author4=Bingxiang Liub|author5=Yan Wub|author6=Aihua Xiongc|author7=Tianwen Dong|title=Prediction of gas solubility in polymers by back propagation artificial neural network based on self-adaptive particle swarm optimization algorithm and chaos theory|journal=Fluid Phase Equilibria|date=25 October 2013|volume=356|pages=11–17|doi=10.1016/j.fluid.2013.07.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[celestial mechanics]], especially when observing asteroids, applying chaos theory leads to better predictions about when these objects will approach Earth and other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morbidelli|first=A.|title=Chaotic diffusion in celestial mechanics|journal=Regular &amp; Chaotic Dynamics |year=2001|volume=6|issue=4|pages=339–353|doi=10.1070/rd2001v006n04abeh000182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four of the five [[moons of Pluto]] rotate chaotically. In [[quantum physics]] and [[electrical engineering]], the study of large arrays of [[Josephson junctions]] benefitted greatly from chaos theory.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Strogatz, ''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order, Hyperion, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Closer to home, coal mines have always been dangerous places where frequent natural gas leaks cause many deaths. Until recently, there was no reliable way to predict when they would occur. But these gas leaks have chaotic tendencies that, when properly modeled, can be predicted fairly accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dingqi|first=Li|author2=Yuanping Chenga|author3=Lei Wanga|author4=Haifeng Wanga|author5=Liang Wanga|author6=Hongxing Zhou|title=Prediction method for risks of coal and gas outbursts based on spatial chaos theory using gas desorption index of drill cuttings|journal=Mining Science and Technology|date=May 2011|volume=21|issue=3|pages=439–443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaos theory can be applied outside of the natural sciences, but historically nearly all such studies have suffered from lack of reproducibility; poor external validity; and/or inattention to cross-validation, resulting in poor predictive accuracy (if out-of-sample prediction has even been attempted).  Glass &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Glass | first1 = L |editor1-first=C |editor1-last= Grebogi |editor2-first=J. A. | editor2-last=Yorke |title= The impact of chaos on science and society|publisher= United Nations University Press |year=1997 |chapter= Dynamical disease:  The impact of nonlinear dynamics and chaos on cardiology and medicine }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mandell and Selz &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mandell |first1= A.

Researchers have continued to apply chaos theory to psychology. For example, in modeling group behavior in which heterogeneous members may behave as if sharing to different degrees what in [[Wilfred Bion]]'s theory is a  basic assumption, researchers have found that the group dynamic is the result of the individual dynamics of the members: each individual reproduces the group dynamics in a different scale, and the chaotic behavior of the group is reflected in each member.&lt;ref name="Dal FornoMerlone2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dal Forno | first1 = Arianna | last2 = Merlone | first2 = Ugo | title = Nonlinear dynamics in work groups with Bion's basic assumptions | journal = Nonlinear Dynamics, Psychology, and Life Sciences | volume = 17| issue=2 | year = 2013 | pages = 295–315 | issn = 1090-0578  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redington and Reidbord (1992) attempted to demonstrate that the human heart could display chaotic traits.  They monitored the changes in between-heartbeat intervals for a single psychotherapy patient as she moved through periods of varying emotional intensity during a therapy session.  Results were admittedly inconclusive.  Not only were there ambiguities in the various plots the authors produced to purportedly show evidence of chaotic dynamics (spectral analysis, phase trajectory, and autocorrelation plots), but when they attempted to compute a Lyapunov exponent as more definitive confirmation of chaotic behavior, the authors found they could not reliably do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Redington|first=D. J.|last2=Reidbord|first2=S. P.|title=Chaotic dynamics in autonomic nervous system activity of a patient during a psychotherapy session|journal=Biological Psychiatry|date=1992|volume=31|issue=10|pages=993–1007|pmid=1511082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 1995 paper, Metcalf and Allen  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Metcalf |first1= B. R. | last2 = Allen |first2= J. D. |editor1-first=F. D. |editor1-last= Abraham |editor2-first=A. R. | editor2-last=Gilgen |title= Chaos theory in psychology |publisher= Greenwood Press |year=1995 |chapter= In search of chaos in schedule-induced polydipsia }}&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that they uncovered in animal behavior a pattern of period doubling leading to chaos.  The authors examined a well-known response called schedule-induced polydipsia, by which an animal deprived of food for certain lengths of time will drink unusual amounts of water when the food is at last presented.  The control parameter (r) operating here was the length of the interval between feedings, once resumed.  The authors were careful to test a large number of animals and to include many replications, and they designed their experiment so as to rule out the likelihood that changes in response patterns were caused by different starting places for r.

Time series and first delay plots provide the best support for the claims made, showing a fairly clear march from periodicity to irregularity as the feeding times were increased.  The various phase trajectory plots and spectral analyses, on the other hand, do not match up well enough with the other graphs or with the overall theory to lead inexorably to a chaotic diagnosis.  For example, the phase trajectories do not show a definite progression towards greater and greater complexity (and away from periodicity); the process seems quite muddied.  Also, where Metcalf and Allen saw periods of two and six in their spectral plots, there is room for alternative interpretations.  All of this ambiguity necessitate some serpentine, post-hoc explanation to show that results fit a chaotic model.

By adapting a model of career counseling to include a chaotic interpretation of the relationship between employees and the job market, Aniundson and Bright found that better suggestions can be made to people struggling with career decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pryor|first=Robert G. L.|author2=Norman E. Aniundson|author3=Jim E. H. Bright|title=Probabilities and Possibilities: The Strategic Counseling Implications of the Chaos Theory of Careers|journal=The Career Development Quarterly|date=June 2008|volume=56|issue=4|pages=309–318|doi=10.1002/j.2161-0045.2008.tb00096.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern organizations are increasingly seen as open [[complex adaptive system]]s with fundamental natural nonlinear structures, subject to internal and external forces that may contribute chaos. For instance, [[team building]] and [[group development]] is increasingly being researched as an inherently unpredictable system, as the uncertainty of different individuals meeting for the first time makes the trajectory of the team unknowable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Jamie|last2=Johnstone|first2=James|last3=Banks|first3=Curt|date=2018|title=An examination of initiation rituals in a UK sporting institution and the impact on group development|url=http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984|journal=European Sport Management Quarterly|pages=1–19|doi=10.1080/16184742.2018.1439984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some say the chaos metaphor—used in verbal theories—grounded on mathematical models and psychological aspects of human behavior
provides helpful insights to describing the complexity of small work groups, that go beyond the metaphor itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dal Forno | first1 = Arianna | last2 = Merlone | first2 = Ugo |editor1-first=Gian Italo |editor1-last=Bischi  |editor2-first=Carl | editor2-last=Chiarella |editor3-first=Irina | editor3-last=Shusko |title=Global Analysis of Dynamic Models in Economics and Finance |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2013 |pages=185–204 |chapter= Chaotic Dynamics in Organization Theory |isbn= 978-3-642-29503-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It  is possible that economic models can also be improved through an application of chaos theory, but predicting the health of an economic system and what factors influence it most is an extremely complex task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juárez|first=Fernando|title=Applying the theory of chaos and a complex model of health to establish relations among financial indicators|journal=Procedia Computer Science|year=2011|volume=3|pages=982–986|doi=10.1016/j.procs.2010.12.161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic and financial systems are fundamentally different from those in the classical natural sciences since the former are inherently stochastic in nature, as they result from the interactions of people, and thus pure deterministic models are unlikely to provide accurate representations of the data. The empirical literature that tests for chaos in economics and finance presents very mixed results, in part due to confusion between specific tests for chaos and more general tests for non-linear relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Brooks (academic)|title=Chaos in foreign exchange markets: a sceptical view |journal=Computational Economics|year=1998 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=265–281 |issn=1572-9974 |doi=10.1023/A:1008650024944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traffic forecasting may benefit from applications of chaos theory. Better predictions of when traffic will occur would allow measures to be taken to disperse it before it would have occurred. Combining chaos theory principles with a few other methods has led to a more accurate short-term prediction model (see the plot of the BML traffic model at right).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Jin|author2=Qixin Shi|title=Short-term traffic speed forecasting hybrid model based on Chaos–Wavelet Analysis-Support Vector Machine theory|journal=Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies|date=February 2013|volume=27|pages=219–232|doi=10.1016/j.trc.2012.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaos theory has been applied to environmental [[water cycle]] data (aka hydrological data), such as rainfall and streamflow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/research/projects/chaos-hydrology/|title=Dr. Gregory B. Pasternack – Watershed Hydrology, Geomorphology, and Ecohydraulics :: Chaos in Hydrology|website=pasternack.ucdavis.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies have yielded controversial results, because the methods for detecting a chaotic signature are often relatively subjective.  Early studies tended to "succeed" in finding chaos, whereas subsequent studies and meta-analyses called those studies into question and provided explanations for why these datasets are not likely to have low-dimension chaotic dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasternack|first=Gregory B.|date=1999-11-01|title=Does the river run wild?

'''''Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament''''' was edited by [[G. K. Beale]] and [[D. A. Carson]], and published by [[Baker Books]] in 2007.

It is a comprehensive [[Bible commentary]] on [[Old Testament]] references within the [[New Testament]]. The editors headed a team of scholars to identify, explain and comment on both the direct quotations within the text of the New Testament and its many other probable allusions to the Old.

In a 2008 interview, Beale explained that the writers [[Eclecticism|eclectically]] extended the [[historical-grammatical method]] of exegesis, seeking a "biblical-theological perspective that really goes beyond the traditional understanding of grammatical-historical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Testaments, One Story|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/februaryweb-only/106-52.0.html?paging=off|accessdate=June 25, 2012|newspaper=Christianity Today|date=February 8, 2008|author=Collin Hansen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The commentary won the 2008 [[Christianity Today]] Award of Merit in Biblical Studies, was finalist in the 2008 Christian Book Award in the Bible and Reference Category, and was named Academic Book of the Year (2008) by the Association of Theological Booksellers.&lt;ref name="wts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wts.edu/stayinformed/view.html?id=395|title=Dr. G.K. Beale, Visiting Professor of NT|date=March 7, 2009|publisher=Westminster Theological Seminary|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was the work of a team of Protestant scholars, Catholic apologist [[Scott Hahn]] welcomed the Commentary as "a momentous accomplishment" and "invaluable resource" for Protestants and Catholics alike.

==Availability==
As well as a 1,152-page print edition, the Commentary is available in digital form as an e-book for [[Amazon Kindle]], and as a [[Bible software]] add-on for products including  [[Accordance]], [[Logos Bible Software|Logos]], [[QuickVerse]] and [[WORDsearch]].

A '''corpus manager''' ('''corpus browser''' or '''corpus query system''') is a tool for multilingual [[Corpus linguistics|corpus]] analysis, which allows effective searching in corpora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.korpus.cz/doku.php/pojmy:korpusovy_manazer |title=Korpusový manažer
 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=8 April 2015 |website=Wiki Český národní korpus
 |publisher=Český národní korpus |access-date=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A corpus manager usually represents a complex tool that allows one to perform searches for language forms or sequences. It may provide information about the context or allow the user to search by positional attributes, such as [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]], [[Part-of-speech tagging|tag]], etc. These are called [[Concordance (publishing)|concordances]]. Other features include the ability to search for [[Collocation]]s, frequency statistics as well as metadata information about the processed text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kouklakis|first1=George|last2=Mikros|first2=George|last3=Markopoulos|first3=George|last4=Koutsis|first4=Ilias|title=Corpus Manager A Tool for Multilingual Corpus Analysis|journal=Proceedings from Corpus Linguistics Conference|date=2007|pages=1–12|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/documents/college-artslaw/corpus/conference-archives/2007/244Paper.pdf|publisher=University of Athens}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The narrower meaning of corpus manager refers only to the server side or the corpus query engine, whereas the client side is simply called the user interface.

A corpus manager can be software installed on a personal computer or it might be provided as a web service.

Much of this is achieved by using [[molecular]] and [[microscopic]] techniques that allow the various components of a cell to be visualised as they interact ''[[in vivo]]''.

==Cytome==
[[Cytome]]s are the cellular systems, subsystems, and functional components of the 
[[Human anatomy|body]]. The cytome is the collection of the complex and dynamic cellular processes (structure and function) underlying [[Physiology|physiological]] processes. It describes the structural and functional heterogeneity of the cellular diversity of an [[organism]].  

==Human Cytome Project==
The [[Human Cytome Project]] is aimed at the study of the biological system structure and function of an organism at the cytome level.&lt;ref&gt;Valet G., Predictive medicine by cytomics and the challenges of a human cytome project, Business Briefing: Future Drug Discovery 2004, Ed: E Cooper, World Markets Research Center Ltd, London, 2004; 46-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music notation]], '''Dal segno''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|d|æ|l|_|ˈ|s|ɛ|n|j|oʊ}}, {{IPAc-en|US|d|ɑː|l|_|ˈ|s|eɪ|n|j|oʊ}}; {{IPA-it|dal ˈseɲɲo|lang}}), often abbreviated as '''D.S.''', is used as a navigation marker. From [[Italian language|Italian]] for "from the sign", D.S. appears in [[sheet music]] and instructs a musician to repeat a passage starting from the sign shown at right, sometimes called the ''segno'' in English.&lt;ref&gt;Percy Scholes (1970) ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', 10th edition, Oxford University Press, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two common variants:
*'''D.S. al coda''' instructs the musician to go back to the sign, and when ''Al coda'' or ''To coda'' is reached jump to the [[coda (music)|coda]] symbol.
*'''D.S. al fine''' instructs the musician to go back to the sign, and end the piece at the measure marked ''fine''.
{{Quote|The Italian term 'dal segno' literally means 'from the sign.' In most music you will see either D.S. al Fine (which means 'go back to the &amp;#x1D10B; sign and play the music again until you come to the bar marked Fine, then stop') or D.S. al Coda (which means 'go back to the &amp;#x1D10B; sign and play the music again until you come to the bar marked To Coda, then jump to the coda'). ...You may also see simply...D.S. in the final bar of a score, which means to repeat from...the &amp;#x1D10B; sign...then stop at the end. In music, these instructions always appear at the end of the bar from which you have to jump back (either to the &amp;#x1D10B; sign or to the start of the piece).&lt;ref&gt;Spreadbury, Daniel; Eastwood, Michael; Finn, Ben; and Finn, Jonathan (March 2008). "[[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]] 5 Reference"&lt;!--Sibelius Reference.pdf--&gt;, p.269. Edition 5.2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Al segno''' indicates that the player should go to the sign. '''Da capo al segno''' ('''D.C. al Segno'''), "From the beginning to the sign (&amp;#x1D10B;)."&lt;ref&gt;Stainer, John and Barrett, William Alexander (1898). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=K2H0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=%22da+capo%22+stainer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3_Mnopd3UAhVB7GMKHYTxCfwQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22da%20capo%22%20stainer&amp;f=false Stainer and Barrett's Dictionary of Musical Terms]'', p.133. Novello. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In operas of the 18th century, dal segno [[aria]]s were a common alternative to [[da capo aria]]s which began with an opening [[ritornello]], which was then omitted in the repeat (the sign being placed after the ritornello).

==Encoding==
The ''Segno'' sign is encoded in the Musical Symbols block of Unicode as U+1D10B MUSICAL SYMBOL SEGNO:&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D100.pdf PDF of Musical Symbols block from the unicode consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;#x1D10B;

The '''Dana/Spicer Model 30''' is an automotive axle manufactured by [[Dana Holding Corporation]], has a history that dates back to the 1930s and can still be seen in [[Jeep]] front ends today.  The Dana 30 has been manufactured as a [[beam axle]] and [[independent suspension]] axle setups.   There are different variations of the Dana 30.

* OEM Inner axle shaft spline count: 27
* [[Gross axle weight rating|GAWR]] up to 2770 lbs.

==Dana 30 solid axle history==
===Dana 23===
The Dana Spicer 23 is the axle the Dana 30 is loosely based on today, with improvements throughout time. This axle was only made for the rear of vehicles.  [[Axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating| Full floating and semi floating]] variations were produced.
===Dana 25===
The Dana Spicer 25 was based on the Dana 23 and was made only as a front axle for [[Four-wheel drive]] vehicles.  This was the company's first front drive axle.

===Dana 27===
The Dana Spicer 27 unit phased out Dana 23 and Dana 25 units in the 1960s

==Independent front suspension (IFS) Dana 30 axle==
[[Jeep Liberty]] 4x4 models use the Dana 30 in the form of [[Independent suspension]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4182">In [[literature]], the '''deuteragonist''' or '''secondary main character''' (from {{lang-grc|δευτεραγωνιστής}}, ''deuteragōnistḗs'', second actor) is the second most important  character, after the [[protagonist]] and before the [[tritagonist]].&lt;ref name="deut1"&gt;Bartleby.com (2006). [http://www.bartleby.com/61/56/D0175600.html Deuteragonist]&lt;/ref&gt; The deuteragonist may switch between supporting and opposing the protagonist, depending on the deuteragonist's own conflict or plot.

==History==
[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[drama]] began with simply one actor, the protagonist, and a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] of dancers. The playwright [[Aeschylus]] introduced the deuteragonist; Aristotle says in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'':

{{Quote
|1={{lang|grc|Καὶ τό τε τῶν ὑποκριτῶν πλῆθος ἐξ ἑνὸς εἰς δύο πρῶτος Αἰσχύλος ἤγαγε καὶ τὰ τοῦ χοροῦ ἠλάττωσε καὶ τὸν λόγον πρωταγωνιστεῖν παρεσκεύασεν}}

''{{lang|grc-Latn|Kai to te tōn hypokritōn plēthos ex enos eis duo prōtos Aiskhilos ēgage kai ta tou khorou ēlattōse kai ton logon prōtagōnistein pareskeuasen}}''

Thus, it was Aeschylus who first raised the number of the actors from one to two. He also curtailed the chorus and made the dialogue be the leading part.
|2=[[Aristotle]]
|3=[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]] (1449a15)&lt;ref name="deut2"&gt;Perseus Digital Library (2006). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Poet.+1449a Aristotle, ''Poetics'']&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Aeschylus' efforts brought the dialogue and interaction between characters to the forefront and set the stage for other playwrights of the era, like [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], to produce many iconic plays.&lt;ref name="deut3"&gt;TheatreHistory.com (2006). [http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/aeschylus001.html "Aeschylus and his Tragedies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drama==
Because [[Ancient Greek drama]] involved only three actors (the protagonist, deuteragonist, and tritagonist) plus the chorus, each actor often played several parts. For instance, in Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', the protagonist would be [[Oedipus]], who is on stage in most acts, the deuteragonist would be [[Jocasta]] (Oedipus' mother and wife), as well as the Shepherd and Messenger. This would be because Jocasta is certainly a major role&amp;mdash;acting opposite Oedipus many times and occupying a central part of the story&amp;mdash;and because the Shepherd and Messenger are onstage when Jocasta is offstage.&lt;ref name="deut4"&gt;Wayne S. Turney (2006). [http://www.wayneturney.20m.com/oedipus.htm Sophokles' ''Oedipus Rex'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
In literature, the deuteragonist often assumes the role of "[[sidekick]]" to the protagonist. In [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', the protagonist is [[Huckleberry Finn (character)|Huck]] and the deuteragonist, his constant companion, is [[Jim (Huckleberry Finn)|Jim]]. In this story the tritagonist would be [[Tom Sawyer]].&lt;ref name="deut5"&gt;Dr. L. Kip Wheeler (2006). [http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_T.html Literary Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the deuteragonist could also be a particularly visible [[antagonist]], normally whom the actual antagonist hides behind. In some cases, the deuteragonist is a sidekick who is also used as a foil for the protagonist, in order to more greatly enhance the powers or strengths of the main character. [[Doctor Watson|Dr. John Watson]], for example, in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] series by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], is an educated and intelligent gentleman of professional standing, and yet his own intelligence is of too rigid a stance to embrace fully the kind of possibilities of which the more maverick [[Sherlock Holmes]] is capable.

'''District Regionalism''' is a finance-related [[urban planning]] method. The practice creates a neighborhood stock system in which community shares are sold. The term "District Regionalism" was initially used by the administration of the city of [[Guthrie, Kentucky]] as the distinctive traits of each neighborhood emerged during the trial study. The [[University of Kentucky]]'s College of Design became instrumental in devising the study concept, parameters and goals. The practice concerns organizing cities into smaller communities by allowing creating and distinctive regional and cultural references emerge within neighborhoods by allowing the public to transform what is typically considered as government owned areas and [[Blight (urban)|blighted]] properties. The practice has been proven to alter larger sprawling co-dependant cities into smaller self-reliant communities.

== Share System ==
Community shares are sold in District Regionalist environments.{{clarify|date=October 2013}}  As a community is defined by boundaries and image, the collective population of that community issues shares with monetary value. Initially, stock ownership is given to the community in order to promote the process. An increased number of shares allows a larger amount of voting privileges within that community, therefore allowing some margin within [[city ordinance]]s and [[zoning]].  As more community shares are sold, the pool increases for that community allowing them greater ability to project that money towards community projects. In a District Regionalist community, the city never loses over 51% of shares, allowing the city government to retain rights to city property and have majority rule voting privileges.  As improvements are made to community properties, land values increase and improve the value of private properties within those districts. Cities can also use the community district funding pool to match grants at the discretion of a district's approval.  The share system operates on the premise that communities will care for what they own, as opposed to caring for properties owned by cities.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[Image:moderncityhall.jpg|thumb|right|View of downtown Guthrie, Kentucky showing the redesigned street scape {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;

{{hatnote|Not to be confused with dates [[anno Mundi]],  abbreviated 'AM'.}}
The '''Era of the Martyrs''' ({{lang-la|anno martyrum}}), also known as the '''Diocletian era''' ({{lang-la|anno Diocletiani}}), is a method of numbering years used by the [[Church of Alexandria]] beginning in the 4th century{{nbsp}}AD and by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] from the 5th century to the present. Western Christians were aware of it but did not use it. It was named for the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Emperor [[Diocletian]] who instigated the [[Diocletianic Persecution|last major persecution against Christians]] in the Empire. Diocletian began his reign 20 November 284 during the [[Byzantine_calendar#Alexandrian_Era|Alexandrian year]] that began on 1 Thoth, the Egyptian New Year, or 29 August 284, so that date was used as the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]: year one of the Diocletian era began on that date. This era was used to number the year in [[Paschal_Full_Moon|Easter tables]] produced by the Church of Alexandria. 

When [[Dionysius Exiguus]] continued those tables for an additional 95 years, he replaced the anno Diocletiani era with his [[anno Domini]] era because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn &amp; Holford-Strevens 2003, 767&lt;/ref&gt; The anno Domini era became dominant in the Latin West but was not used in the Greek East until modern times. 

The anno Diocletiani era was not the only one used by early Christians. Most Roman Christians, like the pagan Romans before them, designated their years by naming the two [[consul]]s who held office that year. The Romans also used the [[ab urbe condita]] (AUC) era. Its name is Latin for "from the founding of the City (Rome)." However, the AUC era was hardly ever used outside historical treatises.

Eras that began at Creation, called [[anno Mundi]] eras, became the dominant method of numbering years in the East until modern times, such as in the [[Byzantine calendar]]. [[Annianus of Alexandria]], a monk who flourished at the beginning of the 5th century, placed the epoch of his world era on 25 March 5492{{nbsp}}BC by counting back eleven 532-year [[paschal cycle]]s from anno Diocletiani 77, itself four 19-year [[lunar cycle]]s after anno Diocletiani 1. Regarded as a civil rather than a religious era, it began on the first day of the Alexandrian year, 29 August 5493{{nbsp}}BC. This Alexandrian era was the preferred era used by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Christians such as [[Maximus the Confessor]] until the Byzantine era, having an epoch of 1 September 5509{{nbsp}}BC, became dominant in the 10th century. Both eras used a version of [[dating Creation]] based on the [[Septuagint]].

The '''European Inter-University Association on Society, Science and Technology''' ('''ESST''') is an association of [[universities]] who jointly teach and research in the field of social, scientific and technological developments. Universities from across Europe are members of the association, which was founded in 1991 and is registered as a non-profit organisation in Belgium.

== Activities and ethos ==
ESST runs a programme of teaching and research devoted to [[science and technology studies]], in both historical and contemporary perspectives. The ESST programme has affiliated faculty with strong interests in the intersections of science and technology with public policy, cultural change, and economic development.  The activities of ESST are financed both by the member universities and by external sources,which have included DG XII, DG XXII and the General Secretariat of the [[European Commission]]. From 2004 to 2009 ESST was responsible for the co-ordination of Masters-level teaching activities within the EU's [http://www.prime-noe.org/ PRIME] 'network of excellence' in policy studies of research and innovation.

The ESST programme is international in its outlook: it is a multicultural venture rooted in the teaching, research and scientific cultures of many European regions and countries, and in their wider social experience. The universities have developed a networked postgraduate programme focusing on the social, scientific and technological developments in Europe, which they teach in collaboration with each other. This involves substantial exchange of students and staff from the participating universities.

== ESST Masters degree ==
The ESST association offers a master's degree in "Society, Science and Technology in Europe", aims to develop informational resources, analytical skills and conceptual frameworks for researchers and students in technological change and innovation. The course is designed to provide post-graduate training for academics of all backgrounds: social science, natural sciences, engineering and humanities.

The Masters course is based on active participation by people from industry and engineering, policy-makers and academia from all over Europe. The approach is inter-disciplinary, based on recent results from research at the frontiers of modern studies of science/technology and economy/society. The course aims to relate such research to the social and economic analysis of innovation, to strategic decision-making and management of sciences and (new) technologies, to ethical issues in sciences and technology, and to political and cultural analysis of modern science- and technology-based societies.

The original ESST Master's degree was a one-year course, and this can still be taken by students who start at Oslo or Maastricht University. At other universities the ESST programme is a 'track' embedded in a two-year masters programme. At most ESST universities students receive both a local Masters award and the ESST MA Diploma.

All ESST universities that offer the first semester teach a common curriculum (with some local additions) in this semester, after which students choose a second-semester specialisation from the range on offer at the different universities within ESST. Students have the option either to move between universities (and countries) after the first semester or to stay at one university for both semesters; [[Erasmus Programme]] agreements are in place to assist students who move between countries. All second-semester specialisations are taught in English. The Masters thesis is supervised by an advisor at the second-semester university (supplemented by a 'home' advisor where appropriate) and the thesis is graded by staff from two ESST universities, one of whom is always from the first-semester university.

Starting in 2012-13, students who successfully complete course modules that cover the common first-semester ESST curriculum, but who do not go on to take (or complete) a second-semester ESST specialisation and write a thesis under ESST rules, will receive an ESST Certificate in addition to their local award.

== Undergraduate essay award ==
Since 2010, ESST has awarded an annual prize (currently worth €1000) for the best undergraduate essay submitted to ESST with content relevant to the broad field of society, science and technology. Previous winners include André Feldhof (Netherlands), Miklós Horváth (Hungary), Alina Marktanner (Netherlands), and Frederick Thielen (Netherlands). More information on the ESST Award can be found at the [http://esst.eu/ ESST website].

AM ([[Amplitude Modulation]]) and FM ([[Frequency Modulation]]) are types of [[modulation]] (coding). The electrical signal from program material, usually coming from a [[radio studio|studio]], is mixed with a [[carrier wave]] of a specific frequency, then broadcast. In the case of AM, this mixing (modulation) is done by altering the '''[[amplitude]]''' of the carrier wave with time, according to the original signal. In the case of FM, it is the '''[[frequency]]''' of the carrier wave that is varied. A radio receiver (a "radio") contains a demodulator that [[Demodulation|extracts]] the original program material from the broadcast wave.]]
[[File:ElectromagneticSpectrum-Radio-VHF-FM.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Position of FM radio in the electromagnetic spectrum]]
[[File:KWNR Continental 816R-5B SN 247.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|A commercial 35&amp;nbsp;kW FM radio transmitter built in the late 1980s.  It belongs to FM radio station KWNR in Las Vegas, Nevada, and broadcasts at a frequency of 95.5 MHz.]]

'''FM broadcasting''' is a method of [[radio broadcasting]] using [[frequency modulation]] (FM) technology. Invented in 1933 by American engineer [[Edwin Armstrong]], wide-band FM is used worldwide to provide [[high fidelity|high-fidelity]] sound over broadcast [[radio]]. FM broadcasting is capable of better sound quality than [[AM broadcasting]] (under normal listening conditions), the chief competing radio broadcasting technology, so it is used for most music broadcasts. Theoretically wideband AM can offer equally good sound quality, provided the reception conditions are ideal. [[Radio station|FM radio station]]s use the [[very high frequency|VHF]] frequencies.  The term "FM band" describes the [[frequency]] band in a given country which is dedicated to FM broadcasting.

=={{anchor|Terminology}}Broadcast bands==
&lt;!-- for consistency, let's use the allocated band edges, not the min. and max. center frequencies --&gt;

{{main article|FM broadcast band}}

Throughout the world, the FM broadcast band falls within the [[VHF]] part of the [[radio spectrum]]. Usually 87.5 to 108.0&amp;nbsp;MHz is used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.450-3-200111-I/en | title=Transmission standards for FM sound broadcasting at VHF | work=ITU Rec. BS.450 | publisher=[[International Telecommunications Union]] | pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or some portion thereof, with few exceptions:

* In the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|former Soviet republics]], and some former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, the older 65.8–74&amp;nbsp;MHz band is also used. Assigned frequencies are at intervals of 30&amp;nbsp;kHz. This band, sometimes referred to as the [[OIRT]] band, is slowly being phased out in many countries. In those countries the 87.5–108.0&amp;nbsp;MHz band is referred to as the [[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] band.
* In [[Japan]], the band 76–95&amp;nbsp;MHz is used.

The frequency of an FM broadcast station (more strictly its assigned nominal center frequency) is usually an exact multiple of 100&amp;nbsp;kHz. In most of [[South Korea]], [[the Americas]], the [[Philippines]] and the [[Caribbean]], only odd multiples are used. In some parts of [[Europe]], [[Greenland]] and [[Africa]], only even multiples are used. In the UK odd or even are used. In [[Italy]], multiples of 50&amp;nbsp;kHz are used. In most countries the maximum permitted frequency error is specified, the unmodulated carrier should be within 2000 Hz of the assigned frequency.&lt;ref name="FMtolerance"&gt;{{cite web |title=FM BROADCAST STATION SELF - INSPECTION CHECKLIST |url=https://transition.fcc.gov/eb/bc-chklsts/EB18FM06_2008.pdf |website=transition.fcc.gov |publisher=FCC |accessdate=8 June 2018 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UK Ofcom Engineering Code |url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/37133/code2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other unusual and obsolete FM broadcasting standards in some countries, including 1, 10, 30, 74, 500, and 300&amp;nbsp;kHz. However, to minimise inter-channel interference, stations operating from the same or geographically close transmitter sites tend to keep to at least a 500&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency separation even when closer frequency spacing is technically permitted, with closer tunings reserved for more distantly spaced transmitters, as potentially interfering signals are already more attenuated and so have less effect on neighboring frequencies.

==Modulation characteristics==
[[File:GE FM radio antistatic demonstration 1940.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|FM has better rejection of static ([[Radio Frequency Interference|RFI]]) than AM.  This was shown in a dramatic demonstration by [[General Electric]] at its New York lab in 1940. The radio had both AM and FM receivers.  With a million-volt arc as a source of interference behind it, the AM receiver produced only a roar of static, while the FM receiver clearly reproduced a music program from Armstrong's experimental FM transmitter in New Jersey.]]
[[File:KHTB-FM broadcasting antennas LakeMountain.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Crossed dipole antenna of station [[KENZ (FM)|KENZ]]'s 94.9 MHz, 48 kW transmitter on Lake Mountain, Utah. It radiates [[circular polarization|circularly polarized]] radio waves.]]

===Modulation===
[[Frequency modulation]] or FM is a form of modulation which conveys information by varying the frequency of a [[carrier wave]]; the older [[amplitude modulation]] or AM varies the amplitude of the carrier, with its frequency remaining constant.  With FM, [[frequency deviation]] from the assigned [[carrier frequency]] at any instant is directly proportional to the amplitude of the input signal, determining the instantaneous frequency of the transmitted signal. Because transmitted FM signals use more [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] than AM signals, this form of modulation is commonly used with the higher ([[VHF]] or [[UHF]]) frequencies used by [[TV]], the [[FM broadcast band]], and [[land mobile radio system]]s.

[[File:Armstrong prototype FM transmitter 1935.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Armstrong's first prototype FM broadcast transmitter, located in the [[Empire State Building]], New York City, which he used for secret tests of his system between 1934 and 1935.  Licensed as experimental station W2XDG, it transmitted on 41&amp;nbsp;MHz at a power of 2&amp;nbsp;kW]]
[[File:Waterfall FM Broadcast.jpg|thumb|Instantaneous spectrum and [[waterfall plot]] in the FM broadcast band showing three strong local stations; speech and music show different patterns of frequency vs. time. When the transmitted audio is quiet, the 19 kHz stereo pilot tones can be resolved in the spectrum. ]]

===Pre-emphasis and de-emphasis===
Random [[noise]] has a ''triangular'' [[frequency spectrum|spectral]] distribution in an FM system, with the effect that noise occurs predominantly at the highest audio [[frequency|frequencies]] within the [[baseband]]. This can be offset, to a limited extent, by boosting the high frequencies before [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] and reducing them by a corresponding amount in the receiver. Reducing the high audio frequencies in the receiver also reduces the high-frequency noise. These processes of boosting and then reducing certain frequencies are known as [[preemphasis|pre-emphasis]] and [[deemphasis|de-emphasis]], respectively.

The amount of pre-emphasis and de-emphasis used is defined by the [[time constant]] of a simple [[RC circuit|RC filter]] circuit. In most of the world a 50&amp;nbsp;[[microsecond|µs]] time constant is used. In the Americas and [[South Korea]], 75&amp;nbsp;µs is used. This applies to both [[monaural|mono]] and [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] transmissions. For stereo, pre-emphasis is applied to the left and right channels before [[multiplexing]].

The use of pre-emphasis becomes a problem because of the fact that many forms of contemporary music contain more high-frequency energy than the musical styles which prevailed at the birth of FM broadcasting. Pre-emphasizing these high frequency sounds would cause excessive deviation of the FM [[carrier wave|carrier]]. Modulation control (limiter) devices are used to prevent this.  Systems more modern than FM broadcasting tend to use either programme-dependent variable pre-emphasis; e.g., [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]] in the [[Multichannel television sound|BTSC]] TV sound system, or none at all.

===Stereo FM===
Long before FM stereo transmission was considered, FM multiplexing of other types of audio level information was experimented with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioworld.com/article/how-fm-stereo-came-to-life/277999|title=How FM Stereo Came to Life|first=|last=RWO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Edwin Armstrong who invented FM was the first to experiment with multiplexing, at his experimental 41&amp;nbsp;MHz station W2XDG located on the 85th floor of the [[Empire State Building]] in [[New York City]].

These FM multiplex transmissions started in November 1934 and consisted of the main channel audio program and three subcarriers: a fax program, a synchronizing signal for the fax program and a telegraph “order” channel. These original FM multiplex subcarriers were amplitude modulated.

Two musical programs, consisting of both the Red and Blue Network program feeds of the NBC Radio Network, were simultaneously transmitted using the same system of subcarrier modulation as part of a studio-to-transmitter link system. In April 1935, the AM subcarriers were replaced by FM subcarriers, with much improved results.

The first FM subcarrier transmissions emanating from Major Armstrong’s experimental station KE2XCC at Alpine, New Jersey occurred in 1948. These transmissions consisted of two-channel audio programs, binaural audio programs and a fax program. The original subcarrier frequency used at KE2XCC was 27.5&amp;nbsp;kHz. The IF bandwidth was ±5&amp;nbsp;kHz, as the only goal at the time was to relay AM radio-quality audio. This transmission system notably used a 75&amp;nbsp;µs audio pre-emphasis, a technical innovation that became part of the original FM Stereo Multiplex Standard.

In the late 1950s, several systems to add [[stereo]] to FM radio were considered by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]. Included were systems from 14 proponents including Crosby, Halstead, Electrical and Musical Industries, Ltd ([[EMI]]), Zenith, and General Electric. The individual systems were evaluated for their strengths and weaknesses during field tests in [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]] using [[WLTJ|KDKA-FM]] in Pittsburgh as the originating station. The [[Crosby system]] was rejected by the FCC because it was incompatible with existing [[subsidiary communications authorization]] (SCA) services which used various subcarrier frequencies including 41 and 67&amp;nbsp;kHz. Many revenue-starved FM stations used SCAs for “storecasting” and other non-broadcast purposes. The Halstead system was rejected due to lack of high frequency stereo separation and reduction in the main channel signal-to-noise ratio. The GE and Zenith systems, so similar that they were considered theoretically identical, were formally approved by the FCC in April 1961 as the standard stereo FM broadcasting method in the United States and later adopted by most other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SnvBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;ots=hoHgljSg0y&amp;dq=1961%20fcc%20fm%20adoption&amp;pg=PA189#v=onepage&amp;q=FCC%201961&amp;f=false|title=Living Stereo: Histories and Cultures of Multichannel Sound|last=Théberge|first=Paul|last2=Devine|first2=Kyle|last3=Everrett|first3=Tom|date=2015-01-29|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|year=|isbn=9781623566876|location=|pages=189|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van Duyne|first1=John P.|title=The Notebook:A Modulator for the New FM Stereo System|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.309.3861&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|publisher=Boontown Radio Corp.|accessdate=27 December 2016|date=Fall 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important that stereo broadcasts be compatible with mono receivers. For this reason, the left (L) and right (R) channels are algebraically encoded into sum (L+R) and difference (L−R) signals.  A mono receiver will use just the L+R signal so the listener will hear both channels through the single loudspeaker. A stereo receiver will add the difference signal to the sum signal to recover the left channel, and subtract the difference signal from the sum to recover the right channel.

The (L+R) Main channel signal is transmitted as baseband [[Sound|audio]] limited to the range of 30&amp;nbsp;Hz to 15&amp;nbsp;kHz. The (L−R) signal is amplitude modulated onto a 38&amp;nbsp;kHz [[double-sideband suppressed-carrier]] (DSB-SC) signal occupying the baseband range of 23 to 53&amp;nbsp;kHz. A 19&amp;nbsp;kHz [[pilot tone]], at exactly half the 38&amp;nbsp;kHz [[sub-carrier]] frequency and with a precise phase relationship to it, as defined by the formula below, is also generated. This is transmitted at 8–10% of overall [[modulation]] level and used by the receiver to regenerate the 38&amp;nbsp;kHz [[sub-carrier]] with the correct phase. The final multiplex signal from the stereo generator contains the Main Channel (L+R), the pilot tone, and the sub-channel (L−R). This composite signal, along with any other sub-carriers, modulates the FM transmitter.

The instantaneous deviation of the transmitter carrier frequency due to the stereo audio and pilot tone (at 10% modulation) is

:&lt;math&gt;\left [ 0.9 \left [ \frac{A+B}{2} + \frac{A-B}{2}\sin4\pi f_pt \right ] + 0.1\sin2\pi f_pt \right ] \times 75~\mathrm{kHz}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Stereophonic Broadcasting: Technical Details of Pilot-tone System | work=Information Sheet 1604(4) | publisher=[[BBC]] Engineering Information Service |date=June 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="subcarriers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Subsidiary communications multiplex operation: engineering standards|url=https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/rules1983subcarrier.pdf|website=www.fcc.gov|publisher=US Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where A and B are the pre-emphasized left and right audio signals and &lt;math&gt;f_p&lt;/math&gt;=19&amp;nbsp;kHz is the frequency of the pilot tone. Slight variations in the peak deviation may occur in the presence of other subcarriers or because of local regulations.

Another way to look at the resulting signal is that it alternates between left and right at 38&amp;nbsp;kHz, with the phase determined by the 19&amp;nbsp;kHz pilot signal.&lt;ref name=stereopatent&gt;{{cite web|title=FM Stereo demodulation circuit|url=http://www.google.com.na/patents/US4489430|publisher=USPTO|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Converting the multiplex signal back into left and right audio signals is performed by a decoder, built into stereo receivers.

In addition, for a given RF level at the receiver, the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and multipath [[distortion]] for the stereo signal will be worse than for the mono receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wgbh.org/cainan/article/?item_id=1360980|title=FM Reception Guide: FM Propagation|publisher=WGBH|accessdate=9 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708132643/http://www.wgbh.org/cainan/article?item_id=1360980|archivedate=8 July 2007}}&lt;br /&gt;Includes tips for multipath &amp; fringe problems.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason many stereo FM receivers include a stereo/mono switch to allow listening in mono when reception conditions are less than ideal, and most car radios are arranged to reduce the separation as the signal-to-noise ratio worsens, eventually going to mono while still indicating a stereo signal is being received. As with monaural transmission, it is normal practice to apply pre-emphasis to the left and right channels before encoding and to apply de-emphasis at the receiver after decoding.

In the U.S. beginning around 2010 using [[Single-sideband_modulation|single sideband]] subcarriers for stereo was proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/ssbsc-a-winwin-for-fm-radio|title=SSBSC: A Win-Win for FM Radio?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nab.org/xert/scitech/pdfs/rd040912.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorized to be more power efficient and have less noise at the receiver. A handful of radio stations around the Country are broadcasting stereo in this way. It may not be compatible with very old receivers, but it is claimed most newer receivers cannot tell the difference.

===Quadraphonic FM===
In 1969, [[Louis Dorren]] invented the Quadraplex system of single station, discrete, compatible four-channel FM broadcasting. There are two additional subcarriers in the Quadraplex system, supplementing the single one used in standard stereo FM. The baseband layout is as follows:

* 50&amp;nbsp;Hz to 15&amp;nbsp;kHz Main Channel (sum of all 4 channels) (LF+LR+RF+RR) signal, for mono FM listening compatibility.
* 23 to 53&amp;nbsp;kHz (sine quadrature subcarrier) (LF+LR) - (RF+RR) Left minus Right difference signal. This signal's modulation in algebraic sum and difference with the Main channel is used for 2 channel stereo listener compatibility.
* 23 to 53&amp;nbsp;kHz (cosine quadrature 38&amp;nbsp;kHz subcarrier) (LF+RR) - (LR+RF)  Diagonal difference. This signal's modulation in algebraic sum and difference with the Main channel and all the other subcarriers is used for the Quadraphonic listener.
* 61 to 91&amp;nbsp;kHz (sine quadrature 76&amp;nbsp;kHz subcarrier) (LF+RF) - (LR+RR) Front-back difference.  This signal's modulation in algebraic sum and difference with the main channel and all the other subcarriers is also used for the Quadraphonic listener.
* 105&amp;nbsp;kHz SCA subcarrier, phase-locked to 19&amp;nbsp;kHz pilot, for reading services for the blind, background music, etc.

The normal stereo signal can be considered as switching between left and right channels at 38&amp;nbsp;kHz, appropriately band limited.  The quadraphonic signal can be considered as cycling through LF, LR, RF, RR, at 76&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="quad patent"&gt;{{cite web|title=Compatible four channel FM system|url=http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=03708623|website=pdfpiw.uspto.gov|publisher=USPTO|accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early efforts to transmit discrete four-channel quadraphonic music required the use of two FM stations; one transmitting the front audio channels, the other the rear channels. A breakthrough came in 1970 when [[KIOI]] (''K-101'') in San Francisco successfully transmitted true quadraphonic sound from a single FM station using the Quadraplex system under Special Temporary Authority from the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]. Following this experiment, a long term test period was proposed that would permit one FM station in each of the top 25 U.S. radio markets to transmit in Quadraplex. The test results hopefully would prove to the FCC that the system was compatible with existing two-channel [[stereophonic sound|stereo transmission and reception]] and that it did not interfere with adjacent stations.

There were several variations on this system submitted by GE, Zenith, RCA, and Denon for testing and consideration during the National Quadraphonic Radio Committee field trials for the FCC.  The original Dorren Quadraplex System outperformed all the others and was chosen as the national standard for Quadraphonic FM broadcasting in the United States.  The first commercial FM station to broadcast quadraphonic program content was [[WWWW-FM|WIQB]] (now called [[WWWW-FM]]) in [[Ann Arbor]]/[[Saline, Michigan]] under the guidance of Chief Engineer Brian Jeffrey Brown.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ann Arbor News]]'', [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], January 3, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Dolby FM}}Noise reduction===
Various attempts to add analog [[Audio noise reduction|noise reduction]] to FM broadcasting were carried out in the 1970s and 1980s:

A commercially unsuccessful noise reduction system used with FM radio in some countries during the late 1970s, [[Dolby FM]] was similar to [[Dolby B]]&lt;ref name="Mielke_1977"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last=Mielke |author-first=E.-Jürgen |date=1977 |title=Einfluß des Dolby-B-Verfahrens auf die Übertragungsqualität im UKW-Hörrundfunk |language=German |journal=Rundfunktechnische Mitteilungen |publisher=[[Institut für Rundfunktechnik]] (IRT) |volume=21 |pages=222-228}}&lt;/ref&gt; but used a modified 25&amp;nbsp;µs pre-emphasis time constant and a frequency selective [[companding]] arrangement to reduce noise.  The pre-emphasis change compensates for the excess treble response that otherwise would make listening difficult for those without Dolby decoders.

A similar system named [[High Com&amp;nbsp;FM]] was tested in Germany between July 1979 and December 1981 by [[Institut für Rundfunktechnik|IRT]]. It was based on the [[Telefunken]] [[High Com]] broadband compander system, but was never introduced commercially in FM broadcasting.&lt;ref name="IRT_1981"&gt;{{cite journal |date=1981-12-30 |publisher=[[Institut für Rundfunktechnik]] (IRT) |id=Technical Report 55/81. |title=Prüfung eines modifizierten HIGH&amp;thinsp;COM-Kompanders für den Einsatz bei der RF-Übertragung im UKW-Hörfunk. |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another system was the [[CX (audio)|CX]]-based noise reduction system [[FMX (broadcasting)|FMX]] implemented in some radio broadcasting stations in the United States in the 1980s.

===Other subcarrier services===
[[File:RDS vs DirectBand FM-spectrum2.svg|upright=2.75|thumb|Typical spectrum of composite baseband signal]]

FM broadcasting has included [[subsidiary communications authority|subsidiary communications authorization]] (SCA) services capability since its inception, as it was seen as another service which licensees could use to create additional income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/radio_electronics_1987-08/Radio_Electronics_August_1987_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Radio Electronics (August 1987)"|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of SCAs was particularly popular in the US, but much less so elsewhere.  Uses for such subcarriers include [[Radio reading service]]s for the [[blindness|blind]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chicagolighthouse.org/radio/|title=CRIS Radio - The Chicago Lighthouse|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became common and remain so, private data transmission services (for example sending stock market information to stockbrokers or stolen credit card number blacklists to stores,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}) subscription commercial-free background music services for shops, paging ("beeper") services, non-native language programming, and providing a program feed for AM transmitters of AM/FM stations. SCA subcarriers are typically 67&amp;nbsp;kHz and 92&amp;nbsp;kHz. Initially the users of SCA services were private analog audio channels which could be used internally or leased, for example [[Muzak (brand)|Muzak]] type services. There were [[experiment]]s with [[quadraphonic]] sound. If a station does not broadcast in stereo, everything from 23&amp;nbsp;kHz on up can be used for other services. The [[guard band]] around 19&amp;nbsp;kHz (±4&amp;nbsp;kHz) must still be maintained, so as not to trigger stereo decoders on receivers. If there is stereo, there will typically be a guard band between the upper limit of the DSBSC stereo signal (53&amp;nbsp;kHz) and the lower limit of any other subcarrier.

[[Digital data|Digital]] services are now also available. A 57&amp;nbsp;kHz subcarrier ([[phase-locked loop|phase locked]] to the third [[harmonic]] of the stereo pilot tone) is used to carry a low-bandwidth digital [[Radio Data System]] signal, providing extra features such as station name, [[Alternative frequency|Alternative Frequency]] (AF), traffic data for commercial GPS receivers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crutchfield.com/S-8Ot1uyRSunu/learn/learningcenter/car/navigation/traffic_services.html|title=Traffic Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_message_channel|title=Traffic Message Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2018}} and Radio text (RT). This [[narrowband]] signal runs at only 1,187.5 [[bits per second]], thus is only suitable for text. A few [[Proprietary protocol|proprietary]] systems are used for private communications. A variant of [[Radio Data System|RDS]] is the North American [[Radio Data System|RBDS]] or "smart radio" system. In Germany the analog ARI system was used prior to RDS to alert motorists that traffic announcements were being broadcast (without disturbing other listeners).  Plans to use ARI for other European countries led to the development of RDS as a more powerful system. RDS is designed to be capable of being used alongside ARI despite using identical subcarrier frequencies.

In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], [[digital radio]] services are being deployed within the FM band rather than using [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|Eureka 147]] or the Japanese standard [[ISDB]]. This [[in-band on-channel]] approach, as do all [[digital radio]] techniques, makes use of advanced [[audio compression (data)|compressed audio]].  The proprietary [[iBiquity]] system, [[brand]]ed as "[[HD Radio]]", currently is authorized for "hybrid" mode operation, wherein both the conventional analog FM carrier and digital [[sideband]] subcarriers are transmitted. Eventually, presuming widespread deployment of [[HD Radio]] receivers, the analog services could theoretically be discontinued and the FM band become all digital.

==Reception distance==
VHF Radio waves do not travel far beyond the visual [[horizon]], so reception distances for FM stations are usually limited to 30—40&amp;nbsp;miles (50—65&amp;nbsp;km) They can also be blocked by hills or buildings. 

The [[knife edge effect]] can permit reception where there is no direct line of sight between broadcaster and receiver.  The reception can vary considerably depending on the position. One example is the [[Učka]] mountain range, which makes constant reception of Italian signals from Veneto and Marche possible in a good portion of [[Rijeka]], Croatia, despite the distance being over 200km.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Other [[radio propagation]] effects such as [[tropospheric ducting]] and [[Sporadic E]] can occasionally allow distant stations to be intermittently received, but cannot be relied on for commercial broadcast purposes. 

This is still less than the range of AM radio waves, which because of their lower frequency can travel as [[ground wave]]s or reflect off the [[ionosphere]], so AM radio stations can be received at hundreds (sometimes thousands) of miles. This is a property of the carrier wave's typical frequency (and power), not its mode of modulation.

The range of FM transmission is related to the [[transmitter]]'s RF power, the [[antenna gain]], and [[antenna height]]. Interference from other stations is also a factor in some places.  In the U.S, the FCC publishes curves that aid in calculation of this maximum distance as a function of signal strength at the receiving location.  Computer modelling is more commonly used for this around the world.

Many FM stations, especially those located in severe multipath areas, use extra [[Dynamic range compression|audio compression]]/processing to keep essential sound above the background noise for listeners, occasionally at the expense of overall perceived sound quality. In such instances, however, this technique is often surprisingly effective in increasing the station's useful range.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Adoption of FM broadcasting==
[[File:Armstrong FM radio station W2XMN Alpine NJ 1940.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|One of the first FM radio stations, [[Edwin Armstrong]]'s experimental station [[W2XMN]] in [[Alpine, New Jersey]], USA.  The insets show a part of the transmitter, and a map of FM stations in 1940.  The tower still stands today.]]

===United States===
Despite FM having been patented in 1933, commercial FM broadcasting did not begin until the late 1930s, when it was initiated by a handful of early pioneer stations including W8HK, Buffalo, New York (now [[WTSS]]); [[W1XOJ]]/[[WGTR]] and [[W1XTG]]/[[WSRS]], both transmitting from [[Paxton, Massachusetts]] (now listed as [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]); [[W1XSL]]/[[W1XPW]]/[[WHCN|WDRC-FM]], Meriden, Connecticut (now WHCN); [[W2XMN]]/KE2XCC/WFMN, Alpine, New Jersey (owned by Edwin Armstrong himself, closed down upon Armstrong's death in 1954); [[WQXR-FM|W2XQR/WQXQ/WQXR-FM]], New York;  W47NV Nashville, Tennessee (signed off in 1951); [[W1XER]]/[[W39B]]/WMNE, whose studios were in Boston but whose transmitter was atop the highest mountain in the northeast United States, [[Mount Washington, New Hampshire|Mount Washington]], [[New Hampshire]] (shut down in 1948); W9XAO Milwaukee, Wisconsin (later [[WKTI|WTMJ-FM]], off air in 1950, returning in 1959 on another frequency). Also of note are General Electric stations W2XDA Schenectady and W2XOY New Scotland, New York—two experimental frequency modulation transmitters on 48.5&amp;nbsp;MHz—which signed on in 1939. The two were merged into one station using the W2XOY call letters on November 20, 1940, with the station taking the WGFM call letters a few years later, and moving to 99.5&amp;nbsp;MHz when the FM band was [[FM broadcasting in the United States|relocated]] to the 88–108&amp;nbsp;MHz portion of the radio spectrum.  General Electric sold the station in the 1980s, and today the station is called [[WRVE]].

[[WUSN|WEFM]] (in the Chicago area) and WGFM (in [[Schenectady, New York]]) were reported as the first stereo stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20040203140700/http://www.wgem.com/about/wgem_about_fm105.htm "Stereophonic FM Broadcast Begun by WEFM", ''The Chicago Tribune'', June 2, 1961, p. B-10.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''commercial'' FM broadcasting stations were in the United States, but initially they were primarily used to simulcast their AM sister stations, to broadcast lush orchestral music for stores and offices, to broadcast classical music to an upmarket listenership in urban areas, or for educational programming.  By the late 1960s, FM had been adopted for broadcast of stereo "A.O.R.—'[[Album Oriented Rock]]' Format", but it was not until 1978 that listenership to FM stations exceeded that of AM stations in North America. During the 1980s and 1990s, Top 40 music stations and later even country music stations largely abandoned AM for FM. Today AM is mainly the preserve of talk radio, news, sports, religious programming, ethnic (minority language) broadcasting and some types of minority interest music. This shift has transformed AM into the "alternative band" that FM once was. (Some AM stations have begun to simulcast on, or switch to, FM signals to attract younger listeners and aid reception problems in buildings, during thunderstorms, and near high-voltage wires. Some of these stations now emphasize their presence on the FM dial.)

===Europe===
The [[medium wave]] band (known as the ''AM'' band because most stations using it employ amplitude modulation) was overcrowded{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} in Western Europe, leading to interference problems and, as a result, many MW frequencies are suitable only for speech broadcasting.

[[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]] and particularly [[Germany]] were among the first countries to adopt FM on a widespread scale. Among the reasons for this were:

#The [[medium wave]] band in Western Europe became overcrowded after World War II, mainly due to the best available medium wave frequencies being used at high power levels by the Allied Occupation Forces, both for broadcasting [[American Forces Network|entertainment to their troops]] and for broadcasting [[Cold War]] propaganda across the [[Iron Curtain]].
#After World War II, broadcasting frequencies were reorganized and reallocated by delegates of the victorious countries in the Copenhagen Frequency Plan. German broadcasters were left with only two remaining AM frequencies and were forced to look to FM for expansion.

Public service broadcasters in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and Australia were far slower at adopting FM radio than those in either [[North America]] or continental [[Europe]].

====United Kingdom====
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[BBC]] began FM broadcasting in 1955, with three national networks: the [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]], [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]] and [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]]. These three networks used the sub-band 88.0&amp;ndash;94.6&amp;nbsp;MHz. The sub-band 94.6&amp;ndash;97.6&amp;nbsp;MHz was later used for BBC and local commercial services.

However, only when commercial broadcasting was introduced to the UK in 1973 did the use of FM pick up in Britain. With the gradual clearance of other users (notably Public Services such as police, fire and ambulance) and the extension of the FM band to 108.0&amp;nbsp;MHz between 1980 and 1995, FM expanded rapidly throughout the British Isles and effectively took over from LW and MW as the delivery platform of choice for fixed and portable domestic and vehicle-based receivers. In addition, [[Ofcom]] (previously the Radio Authority) in the UK issues on demand Restricted Service Licences on FM and also on AM (MW) for short-term local-coverage broadcasting which is open to anyone who does not carry a prohibition and can put up the appropriate licensing and royalty fees. In 2010 around 450 such licences were issued.

When the BBC's radio networks were renamed [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]], [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] and [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] respectively in [[1967 in British radio|1967]] to coincide with the launch of [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]], the new station was the only one of the main four to not have an FM frequency allocated, which was the case for 21 years. Instead, Radio 1 shared airtime with Radio 2 FM, on Saturday afternoons, Sunday evenings, weekday evenings (10pm to midnight) and Bank Holidays. Eventually in [[1987 in British radio|1987]] a frequency range of 97.6-99.8&amp;nbsp;MHz was allocated as police relay transmitters were moved from the 100&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency, starting in London before being broadly completed by 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio 1 History - Transmitters|url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/radio1/transmitter.htm|work=Radio Rewind|accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
[[Italy]] adopted FM broadcast widely in the early 1970s, but first experiments made by RAI dated back to 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=[IT] Radio FM in Italia|url=http://www.leradiodisophie.it/AM-FM-storia.html|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the "movement for free radio", developed by so-called "pirates", forced the recognition of free speech rights also through the use of "free radio media such as Broadcast transmitters", and took the case to the Constitutional Court of Italy. The court finally decided in favor of Free Radio. Just weeks after the court's final decision there was an "FM radio boom" involving small private radio stations across the country. By the mid 1970s, every city in Italy had a crowded FM radio spectrum.

====Greece====
[[Greece]] was another European country where the FM radio spectrum was used at first by the so-called "pirates" (both in Athens and Thessaloniki, the two major Greek cities) in the mid 1970s, before any national stations had started broadcasting on it; there were many AM (MW) stations in use for the purpose. No later than the end of 1977, the national public service broadcasting company EIRT (later also known as ERT) placed in service its first FM transmitter in the capital, Athens. By the end of the 1970s, most of Greek territory was covered by three National FM programs, and every city had many FM "pirates" as well. 
The adaptation of the FM band for privately owned commercial radio stations came far later, in 1987.

===Australia===
FM broadcasting started in [[Australia]]n capital cities in 1947 on an "experimental" basis, using an [[Radio National|ABC national network]] feed, consisting largely of classical music and Parliament, as a programme source. It had a very small audience and was shut down in 1961 ostensibly to clear the [[television]] band: TV channel 5 (102.250 video carrier) if allocated would fall within the VHF FM band (98–108&amp;nbsp;MHz).&lt;!--in Adelaide at least, the FM transmitter remained "on air" for some time as a backup source for 5CK, but "scrambled" to satisfy Government policy (!) --&gt; The official policy on FM at the time was to eventually introduce it on another band, which would have required FM tuners custom-built for Australia. This policy was finally reversed and FM broadcasting was reopened in 1975 using the VHF band, after the few encroaching TV stations had been moved. Subsequently, it developed steadily until in the 1980s many AM stations transferred to FM due to its superior sound quality and lower operating costs. Today, as elsewhere in the developed world, most urban Australian broadcasting is on FM, although AM talk stations are still very popular. Regional broadcasters still commonly operate AM stations due to the additional range the broadcasting method offers. Some stations in major regional centres simulcast on AM and FM bands. Digital radio using the DAB+ standard has been rolled out to capital cities.

===New Zealand===
Like Australia, New Zealand adopted the FM format relatively late. As was the case with privately owned AM radio in the late 1960s, it took a spate of 'pirate' broadcasters to persuade a control-oriented, technology averse government to allow FM to be introduced after at least five years of consumer campaigning starting in the mid-1970s, particularly in Auckland. An experimental FM station, [[FM 90.7 (New Zealand)|FM 90.7]], was broadcast in [[Whakatane]] in early 1982. Later that year, [[Victoria University of Wellington]]'s [[Radio Active (New Zealand)|Radio Active]] began full-time FM transmissions. Commercial FM licences were finally approved in 1983, with Auckland-based [[Magic 91FM|91FM]] and [[89FM (Auckland)|89FM]] being the first to take up the offer.[http://www.oldradio.com/archives/international/nzp.html]. Broadcasting was deregulated in 1989.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
Trinidad and Tobago's first FM Radio station was 95.1FM, now rebranded as [[951 Remix]], was launched in March 1976 by the [[TBC Radio Network]].

===Turkey===
In [[Turkey]], FM broadcasting began in the late 1960s, carrying several shows from the One television network which was transferred from the AM frequency (also known as MW in Turkey). In subsequent years, more MW stations were slowly transferred to FM, and by the end of the 1970s, most radio stations that were previously on MW had been moved to FM, though many talk, news and sport, but mostly religious stations, still remain on MW.

===Other countries===
Most other countries implemented FM broadcasting through 1960s and expanded their use of FM through the 1990s. Because it takes a large number of FM transmitting stations to cover a geographically large country, particularly where there are terrain difficulties, FM is more suited to local broadcasting than for national networks. In such countries, particularly where there are economic or infrastructural problems, "rolling out" a national FM broadcast network to reach the majority of the population can be a slow and expensive process. Despite this, mostly in east European counties, national FM broadcast networks were established in the late 1960s and 1970s. In all Soviet-dependent countries but GDR, the OIRT band was used. First restricted to 68–73&amp;nbsp;MHz with 100&amp;nbsp;kHz channel spacing, then in the 1970s eventually expanded to 65.84–74.00&amp;nbsp;MHz with 30&amp;nbsp;kHz channel spacing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukradio.info/OIRT_Tuner/|title=OIRT Tuner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ITU Conferences about FM===
The frequencies available for FM were decided by some important conferences of [[ITU]]. The milestone of those conferences is the Stockholm agreement of 1961 among 38 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/publications/publications.aspx?lang=en&amp;media=electronic&amp;parent=R-ACT-RRC.1-1961|title=ITU Publications|work=ITU}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1984 conference in Geneva made some modifications to the original Stockholm agreement particularly in the frequency range above 100&amp;nbsp;MHz.

==Small-scale use of the FM broadcast band==
[[File:Harumphy.belkin.tunecast ii.jpg|thumb|[[Belkin]] ''TuneCast II FM microtransmitter]]

===Consumer use of FM transmitters===
In some countries, small-scale ([[Part 15 (FCC rules)|Part 15]] in United States terms) transmitters are available that can transmit a signal from an audio device (usually an [[MP3 player]] or similar) to a standard FM radio receiver; such devices range from small units built to carry audio to a car radio with no audio-in capability (often formerly provided by special adapters for [[audio cassette]] decks, which are becoming less common on car radio designs) up to full-sized, near-professional-grade broadcasting systems that can be used to transmit audio throughout a property. Most such units transmit in full stereo, though some models designed for beginner hobbyists might not. Similar transmitters are often included in [[satellite radio]] receivers and some toys.

Legality of these devices varies by country. The [[Federal Communications Commission|U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] and [[Industry Canada]] allow them. Starting on 1 October 2006, these devices became legal in most countries in the [[European Union]]. Devices made to the harmonised European specification became legal in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on 8 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://media.ofcom.org.uk/news/2006/change-to-the-law-to-allow-the-use-of-low-power-fm-transmitters-for-mp3-players/ | title=Change to the law to allow the use of low power FM transmitters for MP3 players | publisher=Ofcom | date=23 November 2006 | accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FM broadcast band is also used by some inexpensive wireless [[microphone]]s sold as toys for [[karaoke]] or similar purposes, allowing the user to use an FM radio as an output rather than a dedicated amplifier and speaker.  Professional-grade wireless microphones generally use bands in the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] region so they can run on dedicated equipment without broadcast interference.

Some wireless [[headphone]]s transmit in the FM broadcast band, with the headphones tunable to only a subset of the broadcast band. Higher-quality wireless headphones use [[Consumer IR|infrared transmission]] or UHF [[ISM band]]s such as 315&amp;nbsp;MHz, 863&amp;nbsp;MHz, 915&amp;nbsp;MHz, or 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz instead of the FM broadcast band.

===Microbroadcasting===
Low-power transmitters such as those mentioned above are also sometimes used for neighborhood or campus radio stations, though campus radio stations are often run over [[carrier current]]. This is generally considered a form of [[microbroadcasting]]. As a general rule,{{vague|date=April 2015}} enforcement towards low-power FM stations is stricter than with AM stations, due to problems such as the [[capture effect]],{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} and as a result, FM microbroadcasters generally do not reach as far as their AM competitors.

===Clandestine use of FM transmitters===
FM transmitters have been used to construct miniature wireless microphones for [[espionage]] and [[surveillance]] purposes ([[covert listening device]]s or so-called "bugs"); the advantage to using the FM broadcast band for such operations is that the receiving equipment would not be considered particularly suspect. Common practice is to tune the bug's transmitter off the ends of the broadcast band, into what in the United States would be TV channel 6 (&lt;87.9&amp;nbsp;MHz) or aviation navigation frequencies (&gt;107.9&amp;nbsp;MHz); most FM radios with analog tuners have sufficient overcoverage to pick up these slightly-beyond-outermost frequencies, although many digitally tuned radios have not.

Constructing a "bug" is a common early project for electronics hobbyists, and project kits to do so are available from a wide variety of sources. The devices constructed, however, are often too large and poorly shielded for use in clandestine activity.

In addition, much [[pirate radio]] activity is broadcast in the FM range, because of the band's greater clarity and listenership, the smaller size and lower cost of equipment.

'''Figurae''' (singular, ''figura'') are the non-signifying constituents of signifiers ([[Sign (semiotics)|signs]]). For example, letters of the alphabet are the figurae that comprise a written word (signifier).  In the [[semiotic]] language of [[Louis Hjelmslev]], the coiner of this term, figurae serve only to distinguish elements (e.g. words) of the expression plane from each other, independently from the content plane.   That is, the letter B, in the written word expression "bat", distinguishes "bat" from the word  "sat", but neither B nor S bears meaning on its own.  On the other hand, the constituents "foot" and "ball" both bear their own individual meanings, such that in the word "football", they cannot be considered figurae, although their individual letters can.  Hjelmslev states that in a given language a "legion of signs" can be constructed with a "handful of figurae" through ever new arrangements of them.&lt;ref name="Hjelmslev"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguists often use the terms [[phonemes]] and [[morphemes]] to refer, respectively, to the figurae and the signifiers of human languages.

The division of the stream of speech into meaningful morphemes plus their further subdivision into meaningless elements is known as the [[double articulation]].  This [[duality of patterning]] of language is one of the few facts of language which most schools of linguistics can agree on.   Occasionally, two morphemes can combine in an arbitrary way into a new morpheme, as in double names such as ''Mary-Alice, John-Paul'', and ''Sarah-Jean,'' creating a kind of triple articulation.  English speakers recognize ''Mary'' and ''Alice'' as parts of the name ''Mary-Alice,'' yet they understand that a woman of that name is in no way a combination of two other women.   But neither are double given names typical of English, nor are surnames meaningless, since surnames usually identify a family relationship.   As far as the combination of meaningful elements is concerned, there is much less agreement on what constitutes a [[syntagm]] (e.g. ''foot-ball, I-am'') and whether any such syntax is universal.

In theory, any sign could be composed of figurae, but care must be taken in distinguishing between the control-number-like function of figurae (as in the individual digits of a telephone extension) and the syntax-like function of meaning constituents (as in the area code of a full telephone number).   For example, the symbols for the lines of the New York City subway system are composed of very elementary parts, e.g., letters or numbers and colors.   While the assignment of letters to trains is arbitrary, and colors are arbitrarily assigned to various avenues in Manhattan,  the combination of a letter or number and color is not arbitrary.  That is, the symbol for the A Train has to be blue, since it runs along Eighth Avenue and all other Eighth Avenue train symbols are blue.   Therefore, these colors cannot be considered figurae.   

On the other hand, the flags of a dozen countries consist of three horizontal bars, distinguished by their colors.   It can be said that the colors and bars form a system of signifiers, consisting of the color figurae in a vertical order.  For example, the flag of Russia is made up of a white, a blue, and a red bar, from top to bottom, whereas the flag of Estonia consists of a blue, a black and a white bar.  From the point of view of a [[vexillologist]], the colors have no meaning until they are grouped together and form the national symbol.   Although white, blue and red may be "national colors" of Russia, combined in a different order they form the flag of Luxembourg.

In reality, most national flags do not conform to the three-horizontal-band pattern.  Furthermore, national flags vary somewhat in their horizontal and vertical proportions, and shades of colors can differ.  Nevertheless, this logical analysis of flags into horizontal-color-bar figurae, though not exact, would probably be arrived at by almost anyone comparing these 12 national symbols.  But it is also possible to over-analyze signs.  For example, a television picture of a flag would consist of thousands of meaningless pixels.   A recording of speech could be digitalized on a CD into millions of meaningless bits.  Neither of these mechanical divisions could be considered figurae.  It would seem, then, that since signs are defined as entities recognized by sentient beings (including many animal species), the constituents of signs, figurae, must also be easily recognizable as entities, even though they have no meaning in themselves.   It probably requires lot of specialization or intelligence to mentally process figurae, since it demands not only the disassociation of the characteristics of a symbol with those of its referent, but this disassociation has to be repeated for each figura that comprises the arbitrary symbol.   Figurae have not yet been recognized in any non-human natural communication system.  Although the honeybee [[waggle dance]] may involve some arbitrary symbols, they are combined with non-arbitrary ones, much like the subway line symbols.

'''Financescape''' is one the five aspects of global cultural flows that renowned [[globalization]] theorist [[Arjun Appadurai]] proposed in his article ''Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy'' that he claims can be used to distinguish the various [[wikt:disjuncture|disjunctures]] or disconnections between economy, culture and politics, within the overall [[World economy|global economy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Globalization Reader|last = Appadurai|first = Arjun|publisher = Blackwell Publishers|year = 1990|isbn = 978-1118733554|location = UK|pages = 94–103|editor-last = Lechner|editor-first = Frank|edition = 5|editor-last2 = Boli|editor-first2 = John|publication-date = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appadurai poses that when considering the financescape framework, we must consider how global capital today moves in an increasingly fluid and non-[[wikt:isomorphic|isomorphic]] manner, thus contributing to an overall unpredictability of all the five aspects of global cultural flows as a whole.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The four other aspects Appadurai mentions in his article are [[ethnoscape]]s, [[technoscape]]s, [[mediascape]]s and [[ideoscape]]s. Appadurai further states that despite disjunctures having always existed between the flows of people, machinery, money, ideas and images, the world is at a crossroads where this is happening to a larger extent; pointing to the importance of studying the "-scapes".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These disjunctures also contribute to the central idea of [[deterritorialization]] which Appadurai describes as the main force affecting globalization in the sense that people from different countries and [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] backgrounds are mixing with one another; namely the lower class of some countries integrating in to wealthier societies via the work force.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Subsequently, these people reproduce their ethnic culture, but in a deterritorialized context.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The fluidity of capital has been expounded on further by sociologists such as [[Anthony Giddens]] who in his 1999 [[Reith Lectures|BBC Reith lecture]] on "Globalization" claims that the advent of electronic money has rendered the transfer of capital and finance around the world subject to an increasingly easy process that posits a major paradigm shift. Giddens suggests that this ease has the potential to destabilize what would be considered prior as stable economies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5480">In [[digital physics]], the '''[[Edward Fredkin|Fredkin]] finite nature hypothesis''' states that ultimately all quantities of [[physics]], including [[space]] and [[time]], are [[Quantum|discrete]] and [[Wikt:finite|finite]]. All measurable physical quantities arise from some [[Planck scale]] substrate for [[information processing]]. Also, the amount of [[information]] in any small [[volume]] of [[spacetime]] will be finite and equal to a small number of possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Fredkin, E. | title=Finite Nature | journal=Proceedings of the XXVIIth Rencontre de Moriond | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptions==
{{Expand section|date=October 2010}}
[[Stephen Wolfram]] in ''[[A New Kind of Science]]'', Chapter 9, considered the possibility that [[energy]] and [[spacetime]] might be secondary derivations from an informational substrate underlying the [[Planck scale]]. Fredkin's "Finite Nature" and Wolfram's ideas on the foundations of [[physics]] might be relevant to [[unsolved problems in physics]].

==Fredkin's ideas on inertia==
According to Fredkin, "the computational substrate of quantum mechanics must have access to some sort of metric to create inertial motion. Whether or not higher level processes in physics can access this process is another story."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalphilosophy.org/Home/Papers/FiniteNature/tabid/106/Default.aspx Fredkin's 1992 "Finite Nature" paper, chapter on "Consequences of Finite Nature"]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Edward Witten|Witten]], "string theory leads in a remarkably simple way to a reasonable rough draft of particle physics unified with gravity";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witten|first=Edward|title=ESSAY: Unravelling string theory|journal=Nature|volume=438| year=2005 |page=1085|url=http://www.sns.ias.edu/~witten/papers/Unravelling.pdf|bibcode = 2005Natur.438.1085W |doi = 10.1038/4381085a }}&lt;/ref&gt; if Fredkin is correct about inertia, then there is the highly controversial hypothesis that the foundations of physics might depend upon either string theory with the infinite nature hypothesis or some modified version of string theory with Fredkin's finite nature hypothesis, in which inertial mass-energy obeys [[Mordehai Milgrom|Milgrom]]'s [[modified Newtonian dynamics]] and not the [[equivalence principle]].

&lt;!--==M-theory with infinite, continuous nature versus M-theory with finite, digital nature==
According to [[Edward Witten]], perhaps the greatest mathematical problem in quantum field theory (QFT) is the "existence and mass gap" problem of four-dimensional quantum gauge theory. Witten states, "Since the asymptotic freedom of quantum non-abelian gauge theory was discovered in 1973, we have known what conjectures one should aim to prove to give a proper mathematical foundation to the standard model of particle physics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Witten, E.|title=Physical law and the quest for mathematical understanding|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |year=2003|volume=40|issue=01|pages=21–9|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-02-00969-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Is the "existence and mass gap" problem crucial for both M-theory and the finite nature hypothesis? If the problem has an affirmative solution, then the logical foundations of QFT are established on the viewpoint of infinite, continuous nature. If the problem has a negative solution in the sense that mathematical proof can show that no affirmative solution exists, then the logical foundations of QFT might require a new foundation below the [[Planck scale]]. If such a new foundation below the Planck scale consists of a finite automaton, then Fredkin and Wolfram are correct, at least in principle.

Consider two mutually-exclusive hypotheses:
# M-theory (or some other theory) might explain the Koide formula, dark energy, dark matter, and space roar with new particles and new waves and without the finite nature hypothesis. There would be BIg Bang —&gt; forever getting colder with infinite, continuous nature.
#The finite nature hypothesis might use a modification of M-theory (or some other theory) to explain the [[Koide formula]], [[dark energy]], [[dark matter]], and [[space roar]] by means of alternate universes spread across some bizarre finite automaton below the Planck scale. There would be ... —&gt; Big Bang —&gt; Big Stop to the Big Bang —&gt; Big Bang —&gt; ... with finite, digital nature and some version of the Fredkin alternate-universe engine.--&gt;

&lt;!---==Objections to the hypothesis of finite nature==
{{Weasel|date=May 2010}}

Fredkin's Finite Nature hypothesis runs counter to the accepted ideas in [[physics]] and the [[philosophy of physics]]. The vast majority of [[physicists]] reject Fredkin's [[hypothesis]] as [[pseudo-scientific]] nonsense.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}---&gt;

==Application==

The broad use of the Gal4 is in '''[[Two-hybrid screening|yeast two hybrid system]]''' to screen or to assay protein-protein interactions in eukaryotic cells from yeast to human.

In the '''[[GAL4/UAS system]]''', the Gal4 protein and Gal4 upstream activating region (UAS) are used to study the gene expression and function in organisms such as the fruit fly.

The Gal4 and inhibitory protein Gal80 have found application in a genetics technique for creating individually labeled homozygous cells called Mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker '''[[MARCM]]'''.

'''IEC 61108''' is a collection of [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standards for "Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and systems - Global navigation satellite systems ([[GNSS]])".

The 61108 standards are developed in Working Group 4 (WG 4A) of Technical Committee 80 (TC80) of the IEC.

==Sections of IEC 61108==
Standard ''IEC 61108'' is divided into four parts:
* Part 1: Global positioning system ([[GPS]]) - Receiver equipment - Performance standards, methods of testing and required test results 
* Part 2: Global navigation satellite system ([[GLONASS]]) - Receiver equipment - Performance standards, methods of testing and required test results
* Part 3: [[Galileo]] receiver equipment - Performance requirements, methods of testing and required test results 
* Part 4:  Part 4: Shipborne [[DGPS]] and [[DGLONASS]] maritime radio beacon receiver equipment - Performance requirements, methods of testing and required test results

==History==
On 1 December 2000, the [[International Maritime Organization]] - IMO adopted three resolutions regarding the characteristics of shipped GNSS receivers.

==IMO Resolutions==
On 1 December 2000, the International Maritime Organization - IMO adopted three resolutions regarding the performance standards for shipborne GNSS receivers:
* IMO RESOLUTION MSC.112(73) GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) RECEIVER EQUIPMENT
* IMO RESOLUTION MSC.113(73) GLONASS RECEIVER EQUIPMENT
* IMO RESOLUTION MSC.114(73) DGPS AND DGLONASS MARITIME RADIO BEACON RECEIVER EQUIPMENT
* IMO RESOLUTION MSC.233(82) GALILEO RECEIVER EQUIPMENT (adopted on 5 December 2006)

Fish produce many eggs, typically about 1mm across, and usually release them into the open [[water column]]]]

'''Ichthyoplankton''' (from Greek: [[wikt:ἰχθύς|ἰχθύς]], ''ikhthus'', "fish"; and πλαγκτός, ''planktos'', "drifter"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are the [[Fish eggs|eggs]] and [[larvae]] of fish. They are mostly found in the sunlit zone of the [[water column]], less than 200 metres deep, which is sometimes called the [[epipelagic]] or [[photic zone]]. Ichthyoplankton are [[planktonic]], meaning they cannot swim effectively under their own power, but must drift with the ocean currents. Fish eggs cannot swim at all, and are unambiguously planktonic. Early stage larvae swim poorly, but later stage larvae swim better and cease to be planktonic as they grow into [[Juvenile fish|juveniles]]. Fish larvae are part of the [[zooplankton]] that eat smaller plankton, while fish eggs carry their own food supply. Both eggs and larvae are themselves eaten by larger animals.&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;[http://swfsc.noaa.gov/textblock.aspx?Division=FRD&amp;id=6210 What are Ichthyoplankton?] Southwest Fisheries Science Center, NOAA. Modified 3 September 2007. Retrieved 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moser2006 /&gt;

Fish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the open water column. Fish eggs typically have a diameter of about {{convert|1|mm}}. The newly hatched young of oviparous fish are called [[larva]]e. They are usually poorly formed, carry a large [[yolk sac]] (for nourishment) and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed [[metamorphosis]]) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae  must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on [[zooplankton]] prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae.

Ichthyoplankton can be a useful indicator of the state and health of an [[aquatic ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=NOAA /&gt; For instance, most late stage larvae in ichthyoplankton have usually been preyed on, so ichthyoplankton tends to be dominated by eggs and early stage larvae. This means that when fish, such as [[Anchovy|anchovies]] and [[sardine]]s, are [[spawning]], ichthyoplankton samples can reflect their spawning output and provide an
index of relative population size for the fish.&lt;ref name=Moser2006 /&gt; Increases or decreases in the number of adult [[fish stock]]s can be detected more rapidly and sensitively by monitoring the ichthyoplankton associated with them, compared to monitoring the adults themselves. It is also usually easier and more cost effective to sample trends in egg and larva populations than to sample trends in adult fish populations.&lt;ref name=Moser2006 /&gt;

==History==
Interest in plankton originated in Britain and Germany in the nineteenth century when researchers discovered there were [[microorganism]]s in the sea, and that they could trap them with fine-mesh nets. They started describing these microorganisms and testing different net configurations.&lt;ref name=Moser2006&gt;Moser HG and Watson W (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qdzg0Vfql2sC&amp;pg=PA269 "Ichthyoplankton"] Pages 269–319. In: Allen LG, Pondella DJ and Horn MH, ''Ecology of marine fishes: California and adjacent waters'' University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0-520-24653-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ichthyoplankton research started in 1864 when the Norwegian government commissioned the [[marine biologist]] [[G. O. Sars]] to investigate [[fisheries]] around the Norwegian coast. Sars found fish eggs, particularly [[cod]] eggs, drifting in the water. This established that fish eggs could be [[pelagic]], living in the open water column like other plankton.&lt;ref name="NBL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/G_O_Sars/utdypning |title=G. O. Sars |work=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]] |author=Geir Hestmark |accessdate=July 30, 2011 |language=Norwegian}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.snl.no%2F.nbl_biografi%2FG_O_Sars%2Futdypning Google Translate])&lt;/ref&gt; Around the beginning of the twentieth century, research interest in ichthyoplankton became more general when it emerged that, if ichthyoplankton was sampled [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]], then the samples could indicate the relative size or [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] of spawning [[fish stock]]s.&lt;ref name=Moser2006 /&gt;

==Sampling methods==
[[File:THE "MARTIN KARLSEN," A CANADIAN SHIP, IS A FLOATING LABORATORY FROM WHICH SCIENTISTS ARE ANALYZING PHYSICAL... - NARA - 549596.tif|thumb|right|Retrieving a plankton sample]]
{{see also|Plankton net}}

[[Research vessel]]s collect ichthyoplankton from the ocean using fine mesh nets. The vessels either tow the nets through the sea or pump sea water onboard and then pass it through the net.&lt;ref name=NOAA2&gt;[http://swfsc.noaa.gov/textblock.aspx?Division=FRD&amp;ParentMenuId=436&amp;id=6268 Ichthyoplankton sampling methods] Southwest Fisheries Science Center, ''[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]''. Modified 3 September 2007. Retrieved 29 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

* There are many types of plankton tows:&lt;ref name=NOAA2 /&gt;
:* [[Neuston]] net tows are often made at or just below the surface using a nylon mesh net fitted to a rectangular frame
:* The PairoVET tow, used for collecting fish eggs, drops a net about 70 metres into the sea from a stationary research vessel and then drags it back to the vessel.
:* Ring net tows involve a nylon mesh net fitted to a circular frame. These have largely been replaced by bongo nets, which provide duplicate samples with their dual-net design.
:* The bongo tow drags nets shaped like [[bongo drum]]s from a moving vessel. The net is often lowered to about 200 metres and then allowed to rise to the surface as it is towed. In this way, a sample can be collected across the whole [[photic zone]] where most ichthyoplankton is found.
:* [[MOCNESS]] tows and Tucker trawls utilize multiple nets that are mechanically opened and closed at discrete depths in order to provide insights into the vertical distribution of the plankton
:* The [[manta trawl]] tows a net from a moving vessel along the surface of the water, collecting larvae, such as [[grunion]], [[mahi-mahi]], and [[flying fish]] which live at the surface.
:After the tow the plankton is flushed with a hose to the cod end (bottom) of the net for collection. The sample is then placed in preservative fluid prior to being sorted and identified in a laboratory.&lt;ref name=NOAA2 /&gt;

* Plankton pumps: Another method of collecting ichthyoplankton is to use a Continuous Underway Fish Egg Sampler (CUFES). Water from a depth of about three metres is pumped onto the vessel and filtered with a net. This method can be used while the vessel is underway.&lt;ref name=NOAA2 /&gt;

==Developmental stages==
Ichthyoplankton researchers generally use the terminology and development stages introduced in 1984 by Kendall and others.&lt;ref name=Moser2006 /&gt; This consists of three main developmental stages and two transitional stages.&lt;ref name=Kendall&gt;Kendall Jr AW, Ahlstrom EH and Moser HG (1984) [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/pdf2/002744900023343.pdf "Early life history stages of fishes and their characters"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists'', Special publication '''1''': 11–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survival==
{{see also|Marine larval ecology}}

[[Recruitment (biology)|Recruitment]] of fish is regulated by larval fish survival. Survival is regulated by prey abundance, predation, and [[hydrology]]. Fish eggs and larvae are eaten by many marine organisms.&lt;ref name=Bax&gt;Bax NJ (1998) [http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/6/997.full.pdf "The significance and prediction of predation in marine fisheries"] ''ICES Journal of Marine Science'', '''55''': 997–1030.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they may be fed upon by [[marine invertebrate]]s, such as [[copepod]]s, [[arrow worm]]s, [[jellyfish]], [[amphipod]]s, [[marine snail]]s and  [[krill]].&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Bailey, K. M., and Houde, E. D. (1989) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=PdfExcerptURL&amp;_imagekey=B7CTC-4SG68VG-4-1&amp;_uoikey=B7CTC-4SG68VG-4&amp;_piikey=S006528810860187X&amp;_cdi=18047&amp;_user=4861547&amp;_acct=C000063557&amp;_version=1&amp;_userid=4861547&amp;md5=950086425a95a06be08a1e736720cf7b&amp;ie=/excerpt.pdf "Predation on eggs and larvae of marine fishes and the recruitment problem"] ''Advances in Marine Biology'', '''25''': 1–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cowan Jr JH, Houde ED and Rose KA (1996) [http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/1/23.full.pdf Size-dependent vulnerability of marine fish larvae to predation: an individual-based numerical experiment"] ''ICES J. Mar. Sci.'', '''53'''(1): 23–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Because they are so abundant, marine invertebrates inflict high overall mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, J. E., and Grover, J. J. (1990) "Predation and food limitation as causes of mortality in larval herring at a spawning ground in British Columbia". ''Marine Ecology Progress Series'', '''59''': 55–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Adult fish also prey on fish eggs and larvae. For example, [[haddock]] were observed satiating themselves with [[herring]] eggs back in 1922.&lt;ref name=Bailey /&gt; Another study found [[cod]] in a herring spawning area with 20,000 herring eggs in their stomachs, and concluded that they could prey on half of the total egg production.&lt;ref&gt;Johannessen, A. (1980) "Predation on herring (''Clupea harengus'') eggs and young larvae". ''ICES C.M.'' 1980/H:33.&lt;/ref&gt; Fish also cannibalise their own eggs. For example, separate studies found northern anchovy ([[Engraulis|''Engraulis mordax'']]) were responsible for 28% of the mortality in their own egg population,&lt;ref name=FAO&gt;Santander, H.; Alheit, J.; MacCall, A.D.; Alamo, A. (1983) [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/005/x6851b/x6851b21.pdf Egg mortality of the Peruvian anchovy (''Engraulis ringens'') caused by cannibalism and predation by sardines (''Sardinops sagax'')] ''FAO Fisheries Report'', '''291'''(2-3): 443–453. Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Peruvian anchoveta]] were responsible for 10%&lt;ref name=FAO /&gt; and South African anchovy ([[Engraulis|''Engraulis encrasicolus'']]) 70%.&lt;ref name=Bax /&gt;

The most effective predators are about ten times as long as the larvae they prey on. This is true regardless of whether the predator is a crustacean, a jellyfish, or a fish.&lt;ref&gt;Paradis AR, Pepin P and Brown JA (1996) [http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f96-051 "Vulnerability of fish eggs and larvae to predation: review of the influence of the relative size of prey and predator"] ''Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences'', '''53''':(6) 1226–1235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispersal==
[[File:Zebrasoma flavescens Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|right|The larvae of the [[yellow tang]] can drift more than 100 miles and reseed in a distant location.&lt;ref name=Christie2010 /&gt;]]

Fish larvae develop first an ability to swim up and down the [[water column]] for short distances. Later they develop an ability to swim horizontally for much longer distances. These swimming developments affect their dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;Cowen RK, CB Paris and A Srinivasan  (2006) "Scaling of connectivity in marine populations". ''Science'', '''311''' (5760): 522–527. {{doi|10.1126/science.1122039}}. [http://fiesta.bren.ucsb.edu/~fd/misc/595/Cowen%20et%20al%20(2005).pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a group of scientists reported that fish larvae can drift on ocean currents and reseed [[fish stock]]s at a distant location. This finding demonstrates, for the first time, what scientists have long suspected but have never proven, that fish populations can be connected to distant populations through the process of larval drift.&lt;ref name=Christie2010&gt;Christie MR, Tissot BN, Albins MA, Beets3 JP, Jia Y, Ortiz DL, Thompson SE, Hixon MA (2010) [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015715 Larval Connectivity in an Effective Network of Marine Protected Areas] ''PLoS ONE'', '''5'''(12) {{doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0015715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fish they chose to investigate was the [[yellow tang]], because when a larva of this fish find a suitable reef it stays in the general area for the rest of its life. Thus, it is only as drifting larvae that the fish can migrate significant distances from where they are born.&lt;ref name=ScienceDaily /&gt; The tropical yellow tang is much sought after by the [[aquarium]] trade. By the late 1990s, their stocks were collapsing, so in an attempt to save them nine [[marine protected areas]] (MPAs) were established off the coast of Hawaii. Now, through the process of larval drift, fish from the MPAs are establishing themselves in different locations, and the fishery is recovering.&lt;ref name=ScienceDaily /&gt; "We've clearly shown that fish larvae that were spawned inside marine reserves can drift with currents and replenish fished areas long distances away," said one of the authors, the [[marine biologist]] Mark Hixon. "This is a direct observation, not just a model, that successful marine reserves can sustain fisheries beyond their borders."&lt;ref name=ScienceDaily&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/12/101222173105.htm Drifting Fish Larvae Allow Marine Reserves to Rebuild Fisheries] ''ScienceDaily '', 26 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Michelangelo Caravaggio 043.jpg|right|thumb|Detail from "The Calling of Matthew" by [[Caravaggio]]:  a single light source casts shadows and emphasizes any variation in texture]]

'''Illumination''' is an important concept in [[visual art]]s.

The illumination of the subject of a [[drawing]] or [[painting]] is a key element in creating an artistic piece, and the interplay of [[light]] and [[shadow]] is a valuable method in the artist's toolbox. The placement of the [[light source]]s can make a considerable difference in the type of message that is being presented. Multiple light sources can wash out any wrinkles in a person's face, for instance, and give a more youthful appearance. In contrast, a single light source, such as harsh daylight, can serve to highlight any texture or interesting features.

Processing of '''illumination''' is an important concept in [[computer vision]] and [[computer graphics]]. &lt;!-- unfortunately I cannot write anything here. I added this note after noticing this while disambiuguating references to [[Illumination (disambiguation)|Illumination]] --&gt;

&lt;!-- the following seems to be copyvio and commercial for websites 

From [http://escience.anu.edu.au/lecture/cg/Illumination/illumination.en.html "Physics"] we can derive models, called "illumination models", of how light reflects from surfaces and produces what we perceive as color. In general, light leaves some light source, e.g. a lamp or the sun, is reflected from many surfaces and then finally reflected to our eyes, or through an image plane of a camera.

The contribution from the light that goes directly from the light source and is reflected from the surface is called a "local illumination model". So, for a local illumination model, the shading of any surface is independent from the shading of all other surfaces.

A "global illumination model" adds to the local model the light that is reflected from other surfaces to the current surface. A global illumination model is more comprehensive, more physically correct, and produces more realistic images. It is also more computationally expensive. We will first look at some basic properties of light and color, the physics of light-surface interactions, local illumination models, and global illumination models.

Scan-line rendering methods use only local illumination models, although they may use tricks to simulate global illumination. Many current graphics images and commercial systems are in this category, but many systems are becoming global illumination based.

The two major types of graphics systems that use global illumination models are [http://acorntiles.com/ glass tiles] illuminations and mosaics. These produce more realistic images but are more computationally intensive than scan-line rendering systems.

The sort of [http://www.acorntiles.com/ floor tiles] one opt for your residence is based a lot upon which you would be using it for. Every single porcelain tile possesses various positive aspects, purposes, and resilience. [http://www.siliconrepublic.com/innovation/item/24836-floor-tiles-that-kill/ Tiles]

'''Industrial archaeology''' (IA) is the systematic study of material evidence associated with the [[industry|industrial]] past.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Archaeology: Principles and Practice, Peter Neaverson and Marilyn Palmer, Routledge, 1998, chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence, collectively referred to as [[industrial heritage]], includes buildings, machinery, artifacts, sites, infrastructure, documents and other items associated with the production, manufacture, extraction, transport or construction of a product or range of products. The field of industrial archaeology incorporates a range of disciplines including [[archaeology]], [[architecture]], [[construction]], [[engineering]], [[historic preservation]], [[museology]], [[technology]], [[urban planning]] and other specialties, in order to piece together the history of past industrial activities.&lt;ref name="siahq1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Society for Industrial Archeology |url=http://www.siahq.org/about/aboutthesia.html |title=About the Society for Industrial Archeology (SIA) |publisher=Siahq.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific interpretation of material evidence is often necessary, as the written record of many industrial techniques is often incomplete or nonexistent. Industrial archaeology includes both the examination of standing structures and sites that must be studied by an [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]].&lt;ref&gt;The Texture of Industry, Robert B. Gordon and Patrick M. Malone, Oxford University Press, 1994, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of industrial archaeology developed during the 1950s in [[Great Britain]], at a time when many historic industrial sites and artifacts were being lost throughout that country, including the notable case of [[Euston Arch]] in [[London]]. In the 1960s and 1970s, with the rise of national [[cultural heritage]] movements, industrial archaeology grew as a distinct form of archaeology, with a strong emphasis on preservation, first in Great Britain, and later in the United States and other parts of the world. During this period, the first organized national industrial heritage inventories were begun, including the Industrial Monuments Survey in England and the [[Historic American Engineering Record]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/heritage-at-risk/industrial-heritage-at-risk/protecting-industrial-sites/ |title=Protecting Industrial Sites |publisher=English-heritage.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a number of regional and national IA organizations were established, including the North American-based [[Society for Industrial Archeology]] in 1971, and the British-based [[Association for Industrial Archaeology]] in 1973. That same year, the ''First International Conference on the Conservation of Industrial Monuments'' was held at [[Ironbridge]] in [[Shropshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://histoire-cnrs.revues.org/1778 |title=The industrial heritage in Britain – the first fifty years, Keith Falconer |doi=10.4000/histoire-cnrs.1778 |publisher=Histoire-cnrs.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conference led, in 1978, to the formal establishment of [[The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage]] (commonly known as "TICCIH") as a worldwide organization for the promotion of industrial heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siahq.org/ticcih/TICCIH_SIA_Agreement.pdf |title=Agreement |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of these and other IA groups are generally a diverse mix of professionals and amateurs who share a common interest in promoting the study, appreciation and preservation of [[industrial heritage]] resources.&lt;ref name="siahq1"/&gt;

==IA topics and sites==
[[File:Boott mill rooftop view.jpg|thumb|[[Boott Cotton Mills]], [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], restored as part of the [[Lowell National Historic Park]], established the 1970s largely through the efforts of industrial archaeologists.]]
Industrial archaeology covers a wide range of topics, from early [[ironworks]] and water-powered mills to large modern factories, as well as ancillary sites and structures such as worker housing, warehouses and infrastructure.
&lt;br /&gt;
IA topics generally fall into one of four categories: 
*'''Extractive''' (also known as "basic materials", which includes mining, quarrying, petroleum, lumbering, etc.), 
*'''Manufacturing''' (mills and factories, including their power systems and machinery), 
*'''Public utilities''' (water, sewer, electric, gas, etc.), and 
*'''Transport''' (canals, railways, roads, aviation, bridges, tunnels, etc.).

Additionally, the topic of '''power generation''' (water, wind, steam, electric, etc.), while applicable to each of the four major IA categories, is sometimes considered its own category.

The work of industrial archaeologists has led to greater public awareness of [[industrial heritage]], including the creation of industry museums and the inclusion of sites on national and international historic cultural registers in many parts of the world. Notable examples include the [[Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust|Ironbridge Gorge Museums]], [[Engelsberg Ironworks]] and [[Lowell National Historical Park]], among many others.

===Early developments===
One of the earliest forerunners of the mid-20th century IA-movement was the Sheffield Trades Technical Societies, established in 1918 at the [[University of Sheffield]] to preserve elements of that city's industrial history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topforge.co.uk/Magazines/Society.htm |title=Sheffield Trades Historical Society |publisher=Topforge.co.uk |date=1993-10-16 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, the [[Newcomen Society]] was founded in Great Britain to foster the study of the history of engineering and technology, including many relics of the [[industrial revolution]], such as steam engines, canals, iron bridges, machinery, and other historical artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newcomen.com/?page_id=30 |title=About Newcomen |publisher=Newcomen.com |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Newcomen Society also established the ''Journal of Industrial Archaeology'' in 1964, first national IA-publication in the UK.&lt;ref name="industrial-archaeology1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industrial-archaeology.org/aba86.htm |title=A major change in human evolution |publisher=Industrial-archaeology.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early development was the formation of the [[Cornish Engines Preservation Committee]] (CEPC) in 1935, to rescue the [[Levant Mine and Beam Engine]] in [[Cornwall]].

During the early 20th century, the [[historic preservation]] movement in the [[United States]] was still in its infancy. Most of the historic sites that received any attention were related to presidents and political figures, or the early [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial period]]. However, in 1925, one of the first industrial museums in the [[United States]] opened at [[Old Slater Mill]], in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]], at the site of the first successful [[textile mill]] in the country, built in 1793. The museum was founded by a group of business leaders with ties to the [[New England]] textile industry, during a period of decline due to Southern competition. The Old Slater Mill Association had the foresight to restore the old mill to its early 19th century appearance, and fill it with a representative collection of textile machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slatermill.org/museum/about/ |title=About Us |publisher=Slater Mill |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, [[Old Slater Mill]] was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]]. In the early 1970s, Paul E. Rivard, then the director of the Old Slater Mill museum was one of the key figures in the founding of the [[Society for Industrial Archeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Society for Industrial Archeology |url=http://www.siahq.org/about/siahistory.html |title=The roots of the Society for Industrial Archeology |publisher=Siahq.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable example of an early industrial archaeology site (one that predates the widespread IA-movement), is the [[Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site]] in [[Saugus, Massachusetts]]. It is the site of the first integrated iron works in North America, and was reconstructed in the 1950s after extensive archaeological excavations that began in the late 1940s by [[Roland W. Robbins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/sair/historyculture/index.htm |title=The Significance of Saugus Iron Works to the United States and the World |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginnings of the IA movement===
The term “industrial archaeology” was popularised in Great Britain in 1955 by Michael Rix of [[Birmingham University]], who wrote an article in ''The Amateur Historian'', about the need for greater study and preservation of 18th and 19th century industrial sites and relics of the British [[industrial revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;World Industrial Archaeology, Kenneth Hudson&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, [[Council for British Archaeology]] (CBA) established an industrial archaeology research committee.&lt;ref name="industrial-archaeology1"/&gt; The CBA soon developed a standardized record card for industrial monuments, which it distributed to volunteer groups around the UK. In 1965, the National Record of Industrial Monuments (NRIM) was created as a central archive for the record cards that had been collected by Angus Buchanan at the [[University of Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Archaeology:A Handbook, Palmer, Nevell &amp; Sissons, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1960s, a number of local industrial archaeology groups had been formed in the UK, including the Gloucestershire Society for Industrial Archaeology in 1963, the Bristol Industrial Archaeological Society in 1967, and the [[Greater London Industrial Archaeology Society]] in 1968, among others. The primary mission of these local IA groups during this period was recording the remaining relics of industrial history, especially those deemed to be most at risk from urban redevelopment schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Mason |url=http://www.glias.org.uk/ |title=GLIAS |publisher=GLIAS |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the condition of the site or artifact, recording typically consists of compiling a brief summary of the site's history through available records, including old maps or photographs, followed by detailed onsite measurements, drawings and photographs of the existing conditions of the site. Generally, a report is prepared and copies are filed in a public archive for the benefit of future generations. Most recording trips are intended to obtain a general overview of existing conditions, and are not meant to be an exhaustive study.

One of the first areas to be the subject of a systematic study of industrial archaeology was the [[Ironbridge Gorge]] in [[Shropshire]], [[United Kingdom]]. This landscape developed from the 17th century as one of the first industrial landscapes in the world, and by the 18th century had a range of extractive industries as well as extensive [[iron]] making, [[ceramic]] manufacturing, and a series of early railways. The Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust was established in 1967, and the significance of the [[Ironbridge Gorge]] was recognized in 1986 with its designation as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/371 |title=Ironbridge Gorge - UNESCO |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, British journalist [[Kenneth Hudson]] published the first IA text, titled ''Industrial archaeology: an introduction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Industrial_archaeology.html?id=C4xIAAAAMAAJ |title=Industrial archaeology: an introduction, Google books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later in April 1967, Hudson spoke at a seminar at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], at what is considered the birth of the IA-movement in the United States. The seminar, which was attended by an audience of historic preservationists, museum professionals and others, focused on what was being done to promote the study of industrial archaeology in Great Britain and in Europe, and what needed to be done in the United States.&lt;ref name="siahq2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Society for Industrial Archeology |url=http://www.siahq.org/about/aboutthesia/history.html |title=The Birth of the SIA and Reminiscences by Some of its Founders |publisher=Siahq.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, a number of select historic industrial sites had been recorded by the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] (HABS), which until then had mainly concentrated its efforts on architecturally significant sites. In 1967, the notable ''New England Textile Mills Survey'' (NETMS) was performed under the HABS umbrella, led by Robert M. Vogel, curator of the Division of Mechanical and Civil at the Smithsonian Museum of History and Technology. The NETMS was the first large-scale, industrial recording project by HABS.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Robert M., ''Historical Archaeology'', The New England Textile Mill Survey, Vol. 1, 1967, page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by the ''New England Textile Mill Survey II'' in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Sande, Ted, ''Technology and Culture'', The National Park Service and the History of Technology: The New England Textile Mill Survey, Vol. 14, No. 3, July 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The full reports from the 1967 and 1968 textile mill surveys are now available for public viewing on the Library of Congress website, including the [[Amoskeag Millyard]] in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], which was drastically altered soon after the survey was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hh/item/nh0041/ |title=Amoskeag Millyard, Canal Street, Manchester, Hillsborough County, NH |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the 1967 and 1968 mill surveys led to the formation of the [[Historic American Engineering Record]] (HAER) in 1969, in conjunction with the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]. Since then, thousands of industrial / engineering sites and structures throughout the United States have been recorded by HAER, and are on record at the [https://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hh/ Library of Congress] for public benefit.

===1970s-1980s===
By the early 1970s, industrial archaeology was, for the most part, being practiced in a few select countries by amateurs and professionals with different backgrounds and objectives. While much had been accomplished during the preceding decade, the "new" field of industrial archaeology was still struggling to gain acceptance as a true scholarly pursuit. In October 1971, a group of representatives from various museums, universities, and government organizations in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] met in [[Washington, D.C.]] to establish a means to improve the exchange of ideas and information. The result was the first national-level, IA-related [[academic society]] in the world; the [[Society for Industrial Archeology]] (SIA). It was decided that the name of the Society would take on the US-Government's spelling of ''"archeology"'', instead of "archaeology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saa.org/ForthePublic/Resources/OtherUsefulResources/Whyaretheretwodifferentspellingsarchaeology/tabid/1078/Default.aspx |title=Why are there two different spellings: archaeology and archeology? |publisher=Saa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first SIA newsletter was published in January 1972, with Robert M. Vogel as editor. In April of that same year the new group held its first annual conference in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="siahq2"/&gt; In 1975, the SIA introduced its [[academic journal]], [[IA, The Journal of the Society for Industrial Archeology]], with [[Emory Kemp]] as editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Society for Industrial Archeology |url=http://www.siahq.org/iajournal/pubs1.html |title=Contents of past issues of IA, The Journal of the Society for Industrial Archeology |publisher=Siahq.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the [[Association for Industrial Archaeology]] (AIA) was founded in Great Britain. It brought together the numerous local IA-groups that had been formed throughout the country.&lt;ref name="industrial-archaeology1"/&gt; The AIA publishes a newsletter, ''Industrial Archaeology News'', along with its academic journal, ''Industrial Archaeology Review'', introduced in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industrial-archaeology.org/aiareview.htm |title=Industrial Archaeology Review |publisher=Industrial-archaeology.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many AIA members have been active in promoting the mission of IA throughout Europe and the rest of the world.

With the rapid decline of many established industries in North America and Europe during the 1970s, industrial archaeologists began to take on a new role of recording and preserving recently closed sites, as opposed to antique relics from earlier periods. Among the notable projects during this decade was the successful transformation of [[Sloss Furnaces]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] after it shut down in 1971 into an open air industrial museum. Sloss Furnaces was declared a NHL in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slossfurnaces.com/ |title=Sloss Furnaces National Historic Landmark |publisher=Slossfurnaces.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum opened in 1983 and offers a variety of educational and civic programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crowewrite |first=Christina |url=http://www.bwcitypaper.com/Articles-i-2009-01-08-226311.113121-The-History-of-Sloss-Furnaces.html |title=The History of Sloss Furnaces |publisher=Bwcitypaper.com |date=2009-01-08 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, [[I.A.Recordings]] was founded by a small group of volunteers in the UK, to record past and present industries on film and video, as a resource for future generations.

During the 1980s, the scope of the field of industrial archaeology in Great Britain shifted away from what was taken place in North America, where the theories of social archaeology that were developed in the [[historical archaeology]] field began to be applied to the study of industrial sites. British industrial archaeologists meanwhile mainly focused on the recording of the technical aspects of sites and artifacts. One key development during this period was the shift toward thematic studies of monuments by type, including three initial textile mill surveys in [[Greater Manchester]], [[Yorkshire]] and eastern [[Cheshire]] led by Keith Falconer.&lt;ref name="industrial-archaeology1"/&gt;

===Since 1990===
Since 1990, there has been an ever-increasing awareness of the importance of industrial heritage, confirmed most prominently by the addition of numerous industrial sites to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]]. Many preserved industrial sites have become a vital part of [[heritage tourism]], including the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]] (ERIH), established in 1999. Based on the success of the ''Route der Industriekultur'' in [[Ruhr]], [[Germany]], the ERIH has expanded to consist of sixteen routes in seven countries, with plans for new routes in additional countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erih.net/topmenu/about-erih.html |title=About ERIH |publisher=Erih.net |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of industrial sites that have been preserved and [[Adaptive reuse|converted to other uses]] such as apartments, public spaces or museums instead of being demolished is also a testament to the efforts of industrial archaeologists.

Industrial archaeology has gradually gained acceptance in the academic arena. In the UK, where the field developed largely from the efforts of volunteer researchers, the emergence of developer-funded projects in the past two decades has led to an increased presence of professional practitioners, with the application of theoretical archaeology methods such as [[landscape archaeology]] to the industrial setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orange |first=Hilary |url=https://www.academia.edu/583642/Industrial_Archaeology_Its_Place_Within_the_Academic_Discipline_the_Public_Realm_and_the_Heritage_Industry |title=Industrial Archaeology: Its Place Within theAcademic Discipline, the Public Realm and theHeritage Industry |publisher=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while many university [[archaeology]] departments now include the industrial period in their degree courses, industrial archaeology remains a fairly limited field of study, with few dedicated industrial archaeology programs, such as those offered at [[Michigan Technological University]] and the [[Ironbridge Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ticcih.org/university.htm University Courses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426161532/http://www.ticcih.org/university.htm |date=April 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widespread appreciation of the importance of industrial heritage by the general public is still lacking in many areas, as the subject often maintains the perception of being "not old enough" to truly be considered [[archaeology]]. Additionally, there are often negative associations with neglected or abandoned industrial sites, including the social, economic and environmental consequences ("[[brownfield]]" sites). As with other history-based fields, one of the continuing challenges of industrial archaeologists throughout the world is the competition for ever-decreasing public funding for their research, educational and preservation projects. The sheer number of historic industrial sites and limited funding often means that many are still being lost to neglect, fire and demolition.

In 2003, the ''Nizhny Tagil Charter'' was adopted by [[TICCIH]] at its XII Congress in [[Nizhny Tagil, Russia]]. It is the international standard for the study, documentation, conservation and interpretation of the [[industrial heritage]].

==IA organizations==
There are national industrial archaeology societies in many countries. They bring together people interested in researching, recording, preserving and presenting industrial heritage. Industrial architecture, mineral extraction, heritage-based tourism, power technology, [[adaptive reuse]], and transport history are just some of the themes that are investigated by society members. Most groups publish periodic newsletters and host a variety of conferences, seminars and tours of IA-sites and still-active industries (known as process tours).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Society for Industrial Archeology |url=http://www.siahq.org/tours/siatours.html |title=The Society for Industrial Archeology Annual Conference and Tours |publisher=Siahq.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://industrial-archaeology.org/aconf08.htm |title=AIA-events |publisher=Industrial-archaeology.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924105841/http://industrial-archaeology.org/aconf08.htm |archivedate=2013-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; IA organizations may also be involved in advising on historic conservation matters, or advising government units on revision or demolition of significant sites or buildings.

'''Infant sleep training''' refers to a number of different regimens parents employ to adjust their child's sleep behaviors.

==The development of sleep over the first year==

During the first year of life, infants spend most of their time in the sleeping state. Assessment of sleep during infancy presents an opportunity to study the impact of sleep on the maturation of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), overall functioning, and future cognitive, psychomotor, and temperament development. Sleep is essential to human life and involves both physiologic and behavioral processes. Sleep is now understood as not simply a resting state, but a state that involves intense brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;Carskadon MA, Dement WC. Normal human sleep: an overview. In: Kryger MH, Roth T, Dement WC, editors. Principles and practice of sleep medicine. 4th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier Saunders; 2005. pp. 13–23.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first year of life is a time of substantial change in the development of both the human brain and sleep. The relationship between the two is vital, as the control of sleep and the sleep-wake cycle are regulated by the CNS.&lt;ref name='Sheldon 1996'&gt;Sheldon SH. In: Evaluating sleep in infants and children. Philadelphia: Lippincott-Raven; 1996. Development of CNS function; pp.&amp;nbsp;71–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''long sustained sleep period (LSP)'' is the period of time that a child sleeps without awaking.  The length of this period increases dramatically between the first and second months. Between the ages of three and twenty-one months, LSP plateaus, increasing on average only about 30 minutes.&lt;ref name = "henderson"&gt;Henderson, J.M.T., France, K.G. &amp; Blampied, N.M. (2010). The consolidation of infants' nocturnal sleep across the first year of life. Sleep Medicine Reviews, 15 (4), 211-220.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a child’s ''longest self-regulated sleep period (LSRSP)'' is the period of time where a child, without sleep problems, is able to self-initiate sleep without parental intervention upon waking.&lt;ref name = "henderson"/&gt; This self-regulation, also called ‘’’self-soothing’’’, allows the child to consistently use these skills during the nocturnal period. LSRSP dramatically increases in length over the first 4 months, plateaus, and then steadily increases at 9 months. By about 6 months, most infants can sleep 8 hours or more at night uninterrupted or without parental intervention upon awaking.&lt;ref name = "henderson"/&gt;

In terms of actual numbers, an infant from one to three months of age may sleep sixteen to eighteen hours a day in periods that last from three to four hours. By three months the period of sleep lengthens to about four or five hours, with a decrease in the total sleep time to about fourteen or fifteen hours. At three months, they also start to sleep when it is dark and wake when it is light. By 4 months there are 2 distinct napping periods, mid-morning and late afternoon. By 6 months the longest LSP is 6 hours and occurs during the night. There are two 3-or-more hour naps with a total average sleep time of fourteen hours.&lt;ref name = "Yale" &gt;Mayes, L.C. &amp; Cohen, D.J. (2002). The Yale Child Study Center Guide to Understand Your Child. United States: Little, Brown and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though sleep is a primarily biological process, it can be treated as a behavior. This means that it can be altered and managed through practice and can be learned by the child. Healthy sleep habits can be established during the first four months to lay a foundation for healthy sleep. These habits typically include sleeping in a crib (instead of a car seat, stroller, or swing), being put down to sleep drowsy but awake, and avoiding negative sleep associations, such as nursing to sleep or using a pacifier to fall asleep, which may be hard to break in the future.&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt;

Every child is different and each child’s sleep becomes regular at different ages within a particular range. In the first few months of life, each time the baby is laid down for bed and each time he or she awakens is an opportunity for the infant to learn sleep self-initiation and to fall asleep without excessive external help from their caregiver.
Experts say that the ideal bedtime for an infant falls between 6 pm and 8 pm, with the ideal wake-up time falling between 6 am and 7 am. At four months of age, infants typically take hour naps two to three times a day, with the third nap dropped by about 9 months. By 1 year of age, the amount of sleep that most infants get nightly approximates to that of adults.&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt;

== Good sleep conditions ==
Many parents try to understand, once the baby is asleep, how to keep them sleeping through the night. It is thought that it is important to have structure in the way a child is put to sleep so that he or she can establish good sleeping patterns.&lt;ref name="Yale"/&gt; Dr Sylvia Bell of Johns Hopkins University reported:&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/1127506?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents&lt;/ref&gt; by the end of the first year individual differences in crying reflect the history of maternal responsiveness rather than constitutional differences in infant irritability. She also notes: consistency and promptness of maternal response is associated with decline in frequency and duration of infant crying. The sleep position is also important to prevent SIDS ([[Sudden infant death syndrome|Sudden Infant Death Syndrome]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medlineplus.gov/suddeninfantdeathsyndrome.html|title=Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: MedlinePlus|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies in sleep training==

A key debate in sleep training revolves around getting the right balance between parental soothing and teaching the baby to self-soothe. Parents who practice attachment parenting think the parent should attend to the baby whenever he or she cries, and limit tears as much as possible.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} However, many popular sleep training methods, such as the [[Ferber Method]] rely on letting the baby "cry it out" for a certain number of minutes, so that so-called "self-soothing" skills are fostered instead of an over-reliance upon externally-provided soothing. The Ferber method has been criticized by some for being harsh, but sleep scientists have yet to find evidence of it causing lasting harm to a child. &lt;ref&gt;Storrs, Carina [http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/24/health/cry-it-out-sleep-training-ok/ "It's OK to let your baby cry himself to sleep, study finds"], ''[[CNN]]''.  Retrieved on 2 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some psychologists say the sleep scientists are failing to take into account the subtle psychological effects of being left alone to cry yourself out: they say: "The fact is that caregivers who habitually respond to the needs of the baby before the baby gets distressed, preventing crying, are more likely to have children who are independent than the opposite. Soothing care is best from the outset. Once patterns of distress get established, it's much harder to change them."&lt;ref&gt;Narvaez, Darcia Ph.D.  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201112/dangers-crying-it-out "Dangers of “Crying It Out"], ''[[Psychology Today]]''.  Retrieved on 2 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}}

Baby soothing techniques include bouncing, jiggling, rocking baby while sitting in a rocking chair, doing knee bends while holding them, doing comfort feeding, providing them with a pacifier, using a white noise machine or app, swaddling them, skin-to-skin contact, using a bouncer or swing to mechanically rock them, and more. Some parents reject the use of most or all baby soothing techniques under the idea that you should teach a baby to self-soothe. Other parents think having devices such as white noise machines and swings are crucial because they allow the parents' to take breaks and get things done other than just holding their baby.

Another method is [[Sleep disorder|Behavioral Infant Sleep Intervention]] to effectively reduce infant sleep problems and associated maternal depression in the short- to medium-terms. This method randomized tried and found effective though, despite their effectiveness, theoretical concerns persist about long-term harm on children’s emotional development, stress regulation, mental health, and the child-parent relationship &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=Anna M. H.|last2=Wake|first2=Melissa|last3=Ukoumunne|first3=Obioha C.|last4=Hiscock|first4=Harriet|date=2012-10-01|title=Five-Year Follow-up of Harms and Benefits of Behavioral Infant Sleep Intervention: Randomized Trial|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/4/643|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=130|issue=4|pages=643–651|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-3467|issn=0031-4005|pmid=22966034}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This method proves to be causing no long-lasting harms or benefits to child, child-parent, or maternal outcomes. Parents and health professionals can feel comfortable about using these techniques to reduce the population burden of infant sleep problems and maternal depression.

== Other influences on infant sleep ==

A number of factors have been shown to be associated with problems in sleep consolidation, including a child’s temperament, the degree to which s/he is breast-fed vs. bottle-fed, and his/her activities and sleepiness during the day.  Moreover, co-sleeping, which is defined here as sharing a room or bed with parents or siblings in response to an awakening, can be detrimental to sleep consolidation. It is important to note that none of these factors have been directly shown to cause children’s sleep consolidation issues. 
In terms of infant feeding, breastfeeding has been found to be associated with more waking at night than bottle-fed infants because of the infant’s ability to digest breast milk more quickly than formula.  Thus, breast-fed infants have been observed to begin sleeping through the night at a later age than bottle-fed infants: bottle fed infants tend to begin sleeping through the night between 6–8 weeks, while breastfed infants may take until 17 weeks before sleeping through the night.  Seventeen weeks of age is still within the first 4–5 months of the infants’ life; therefore, this cannot really be considered a delay in sleep consolidation.  There are many benefits to breastfeeding infants. 
Lastly, temperament also seems to yield correlations with sleep patterns. Researchers believe that infants classified as “difficult,” as well as those who are very sensitive to changes in the environment, tend to have a harder time sleeping through the night. Parents whose infants sleep through the night generally rate their infant’s temperaments more favorably than parents whose infant continue to wake; however, it is hard to determine if a given temperament causes sleep problems or if sleep problems promote specific temperaments or behaviors.&lt;ref name = "Pinilla"&gt;Pinilla, T. &amp; Birch, L. (1993). Help me make it through the night: Behavioral entertainment of breast-fed infants’ sleep patterns. Pediatrics 91 (2), 436-444.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institut Jacques Monod''', funded jointly by the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]] and the [[Paris Diderot University|University Paris Diderot]], is one of the main centres for basic research in biology in Paris, France. It is headed by Giuseppe Baldacci, professor at the University of Paris Diderot.

There &amp;nbsp;are 3 broad research topics (Genome and chromosome dynamics, Cellular dynamics and signalling, [[Developmental biology|Development]] and [[Evolutionary biology|evolution]]) and 2 main transverse axes ([[Synthetic biology|Quantitative biology and modelling]], Molecular and cellular pathologies). Research at the interface of biology with physics, mathematics, chemistry and medicine is strongly encouraged.

Some 300 people work at the Institute (tenured investigators, Ph.D. students, post-docs, technicians, engineers, French and foreign visitors, and administrative staff).

== History ==
In the early 60s, [[Jacques Monod]] was entrusted with the creation of an institute of molecular biology located on a university campus. The original goal was to create a major research centre that would combine teaching and research.

The “Institut de Biologie Moléculaire” (IBM) thus saw the day in 1966, and [[Raymond Dedonder]] was appointed as its first director. The steering committee comprised, in particular, [[Jacques Monod]] and [[François Jacob]], who were to receive the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1965, with their colleague [[André Michel Lwoff|Andre Lwoff]] from the [[Pasteur Institute|Institut Pasteur]]. This committee set the scientific guidelines that were to be developed around the main theme of biochemistry of heredity: the study of [[DNA replication|replication]], [[protein biosynthesis]], the mechanisms and control of transcription and translation in bacteria and in cells of higher organisms, the mechanisms of differentiation, the study of conformation and conformational changes in biological macromolecules, the study of the functional associations of macromolecules and the conformational problems that are posed by these associations.

IBM’s premises (8500 m2) in the Faculty of Sciences of Paris, on the site of the "Halle aux Vins", were formally occupied in December 1969. During the following year, 13 laboratories moved in, and administrative and technical services (including an extensive library, workshop, in-house store etc.) were set up. The institute comprised at that time 143 investigators and teaching staff, and 80 technicians and administrative staff.

In 1978, IBM underwent the first change in its initial organization - the 13 founding laboratories has now become 21 research groups organized into 4 departments. After Raymond Dedonder’s resignation, Francois Chapeville and Giorgio Bernardi were appointed co-directors and, in 1979, the institute was renamed “Institut de Recherche en Biologie Moléculaire” (IRBM).

In 1981, Francis Chapeville remained alone at the head of the institute that he restructured into five departments grouping a total of 27 research teams. In 1982, the institute officially became the “Institut Jacques Monod” (IJM). Then, in 1983, F. Chapeville, in an aim to facilitate cooperation between teams, proposed a different distribution of these teams. There were now just three departments : Structure and molecular and cellular interactions, Molecular genetics of microorganisms and cell differentiation, Development. More new groups joined the Institute during the following decade.

Appointed Director in January 1992, Jacques Ricard again changed the structure of IJM for the sake of thematic consistency. He created 5 departments that were intellectually and financially autonomous (Organization and Expression of the Genome, Supramolecular and Cellular biology, Microbiology, Developmental Biology, and Dynamics and Evolution of the Genome).

By the time Jean-Luc Rossignol took over as director of the Institute in September 1996, around 400 people were working there in 31 labs, including many PhD students and trainees. He decided to maintain the previous structure of five departments, whilst focusing on the consolidation of research topics around “space” (the components and structural and functional organization of cellular space), “time” (dynamics of the cell and of the evolution of genomes), and the “information flow” on which depends the integrated functioning of cells and organisms. Alongside the administrative infrastructure, the various technical facilities were grouped together to form a technological platform with an emphasis on imaging, flow cytometry, and molecular modeling.

[[Eric Karsenti]] succeeded to [[Jean-Luc Rossignol]] in 2001. In preparation for the future relocation of the Institute at a new site on Paris Left-Bank, he set up in January 2002 a federative research institute (IFR 117 Systems biology). This IFR was composed of the IJM (“from the molecule to the organism”) and a dozen other labs working in the fields of functional and adaptive biology and epigenetics.  Under the direction of Eric Karsenti and Jean-Antoine Lepesant, who was in office until late 2008, new teams were recruited in view of this move.
Today, the Institut Jacques Monod is directed by Giuseppe Baldacci, who is a professor at the University Paris-Diderot

The veins add detail into the subject matter of the carving.  Leaf carving originated out of China and gained popularity in 1994 by artist [[Huag Tai Sheng]] after he got the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] to recognize his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/incredible-artwork-hand-carved-from-leaves-2011-8|title=Incredible Artwork Hand-Carved From Leaves|author=Dina Spector|date=August 18, 2011|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weirdasianews.com/2011/08/27/magnificence-nature-chinese-leaf-art/|title=Magnificence in Nature: Chinese Leaf Art|publisher=WeirdAsiaNews|author=M Dee Dubroff|date=August 27, 2011|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The art may related to Chinese [[Papercutting|paper cutting]].&lt;ref name="huffpo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/16/leaf-carving-artists-branching-out_n_925700.html|title=Leaf Carving Artists In China Branching Out Into Pop Culture|publisher=Huffington Post|author=David Moye|date=August 16, 2011|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The material or most common leaf used in leaf carving is that of the [[Platanus orientalis|Chinar tree]].

'''Lewis &amp; Clark College''' is a private [[liberal arts college]] in the [[Pacific Northwest|northwest]] [[United States]], located in [[Portland, Oregon]].  It has an undergraduate College of Arts and Sciences, a School of Law, and a Graduate School of Education and Counseling.

Lewis &amp; Clark is a member of the [[Annapolis Group]] of colleges with athletic programs competing in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] [[Northwest Conference]]. Just over 2,000 students attend the undergraduate College of Arts and Sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lclark.edu/college/offices/admissions/facts_and_figures|title=Facts &amp; Figures - Admissions - College of Arts and Sciences - Lewis &amp; Clark|website=Lclark.edu|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a student body from more than 50&amp;nbsp;countries across six continents as well as most U.S.&amp;nbsp;states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lclark.edu/offices/international/admissions/|title=International Admissions - International Students and Scholars - Lewis &amp; Clark|website=Lclark.edu|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The School of Law is best known for its [[environmental law]] program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/environmental-law-rankings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403220407/http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/environmental-law-rankings |archivedate=2016-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Graduate School of Education &amp; Counseling is active in community engagement and social justice.

It was originally chartered as the '''Albany Collegiate Institute''' in [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]], about {{convert|70|mi|spell=in}} south. The school moved to the Portland campus in 1938 and in 1942 adopted the name Lewis &amp; Clark College after the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]. Today, the three schools and their supporting offices occupy the {{nowrap|{{convert|137|acre|km2|adj=on}}}} campus, centered on the [[M.&amp;nbsp;Lloyd Frank Estate]] on Palatine Hill in the [[Collins View, Portland, Oregon|Collins View]] neighborhood of Southwest Portland.

==History==
[[File:Albany College Administration Building.png|thumb|left|Albany College Administration Building.]]
Like many modern universities, the institution that would eventually become Lewis &amp; Clark was initially intended to provide secondary as well as higher education for a specific religious community, in this case [[Presbyterian]] pioneers in Oregon's [[Willamette Valley]]. To this end the Presbyterian church incorporated Albany Academy in 1858,&lt;ref name=Oregon&gt;Corning, Howard M. ''Dictionary of Oregon History''. Binfords &amp; Mort Publishing, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; making Lewis &amp; Clark one of four Oregon colleges with foundations predating Oregon's statehood (along with [[Willamette University]], [[Pacific University]], and [[Linfield College]]).

Within a decade of its founding, Albany Academy began to focus more exclusively on higher education, changing its official name to the Albany Collegiate Institution in 1866. Lewis &amp; Clark's official founding date comes from the current charter, which has been legally valid since the Presbyterian church reincorporated the Albany Collegiate Institution as Albany College in 1867.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; Unlike most Oregon colleges of the pioneer-era, the college has been coeducational since the first class, which graduated in 1873. The early campus of {{convert|7|acre|spell=in}} in Albany was situated on land donated by the Monteith family. In 1892, the original school building was enlarged, and in 1925 the school relocated south of Albany where it remained until 1937.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt;

Albany College established a junior college to the north in Portland in 1934, with the entire school moving to Portland in 1939.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; The campus grounds later became home to the federal government's [[Albany Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 the college trustees acquired the Lloyd Frank (of the historic Portland department store [[Meier &amp; Frank]]) "Fir Acres" estate in southwest Portland, and the school name was changed to Lewis &amp; Clark College.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; The original school mascot, the Pirates, was changed to the Pioneers in 1946.

'''Make Trade Fair''' is a campaign organized by [[Oxfam|Oxfam International]] to promote [[trade justice]] and [[fair trade]] among governments, institutions, and multinational corporations.

==Objectives==
The campaign has focused on the elimination of several trade practices:

* [[Dumping (pricing policy)|Dumping]], which occurs when highly subsidized, surplus commodities from developed countries such as rice, cotton, corn, and sugar are sold at low prices and farmers from poor countries have difficulty competing.   It is believed that this creates an uneven playing field where farmers in developing countries are unable to compete in the market with cheaper foreign produce and crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_dumping.htm#|title=Rigged Rules - Dumping |accessdate=January 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tariffs]], where nations enforce high taxes on imported goods, restricting the sales of products from other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_marketaccess.htm|title=Rigged Rules - Market Access|accessdate=January 29, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221040624/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_marketaccess.htm|archivedate=February 21, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unbalanced [[labour rights]] for women, who often perceive that they earn lower wages than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_labour.htm|title=Rigged Rules - Labour Rights|accessdate=January 29, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224162419/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_labour.htm|archivedate=December 24, 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stringent [[patent]] issues, that prevent the prices of medication, software, and textbooks (e.g. [[Gene patent]]s, [[Chemical patent]]s, and [[Software patent]]s) from being lowered.  Thus, such essential goods are often inaccessible to developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_patents.htm|title=Rigged Rules - Patents|accessdate=January 29, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322075359/http://www.maketradefair.com/en/index.php?file=issues_patents.htm|archivedate=March 22, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key events==

===The Big Noise===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:MakeTradeFairStipe.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Michael Stipe]] of [[R.E.M. (band)|REM]] is "dumped" with milk to highlight dumping practices as part of the Big Noise petition]] --&gt;
Launched in April 2002, the Big Noise is a worldwide petition that calls for governments to help end unfair trade practices. By the end of 2005, some 17.8 million signatures have been received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org/en/programs/campaigns/maketradefair/index.htm|title=Oxfam International  - Make Trade Fair |accessdate=January 29, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060104033924/http://www.oxfam.org/en/programs/campaigns/maketradefair/index.htm |archivedate = January 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Desmond Tutu]] was the honorary 1 millionth signee to the petition in 2003.  Other celebrities who have lent their names to the petition include the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]], and musicians [[Bono]] and [[Coldplay]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.ca/news/MakeTradeFair/ArchbishopTutu.htm |title=Make Trade Fair - Oxfam Global Petition Hits One Million Mark |accessdate=January 29, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103065246/http://www.oxfam.ca/news/MakeTradeFair/ArchbishopTutu.htm |archivedate=January 3, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically [[Chris Martin]] who would, before performing on stage, draw an [[equal sign]] (mistaken by many to be a tattoo) on his hand. However, this could also be a reference to the [[Human Rights Campaign]].

The petition was also coupled with a popular photo campaign, where celebrities were "dumped" with various crops and foodstuffs to highlight the practice of [[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]], which some perceive to be unfair. [[Colin Firth]], [[Thom Yorke]], [[Jamelia]], and [[Haile Gebrselassie]] were a few of the celebrities to take part in this venture.

===Make Trade Fair concerts===
In 2002 and 2004, special benefit concerts were held in [[London]] to promote the Make Trade Fair campaign.  Proceeds from the shows went to aid Oxfam's promotional campaigns. Produced by [[Emily Eavis]], [[Marianne Troup]], and [[Lily Sobhani]], performers from the 2002 "Fairplay" gig include [[Chris Martin]] and [[Jonny Buckland]] from [[Coldplay]], [[Noel Gallagher]], and [[Ms. Dynamite]], while the 2004 event included Michael Stipe, [[Razorlight]], and [[The Thrills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet/kidsweb/stars/mtf_concert.htm|title=

In 2008, the Make Trade Fair support CD ''The Cake Sale'' was produced. The 9 songs were performed by [[Lisa Hannigan]], [[Nina Persson]], [[Gary Lightbody]], [[Gemma Hayes]], [[Glen Hansard]], [[Josh Ritter]], [[Conor Deasy]] and [[Neil Hannon]], and written by Deasy, Hansard, [[Emm Gryner]], [[Paul Noonan]], [[Ollie Cole]], [[Damien Rice]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfamireland.org/whatwedo/campaigns_advocacy/make_trade_fair/thecakesale.shtml |title=Make Trade Fair CD 2008 |accessdate=February 29, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121174042/http://www.oxfamireland.org/whatwedo/campaigns_advocacy/make_trade_fair/thecakesale.shtml |archivedate=January 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005===
The Make Trade Fair campaign was active at the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005]], held in [[Hong Kong]], [[People's Republic of China]].  Various demonstrations and activities were held, including the handover of some 17.8 million signatures on the Big Noise petition to WTO Director General [[Pascal Lamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maketradefair.com/en/pages/galleries/wto01.htm|title=WTO summit photos|accessdate=February 18, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090706203209/http%3A//www.maketradefair.com/en/pages/galleries/wto01.htm|archivedate=July 6, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marc Fumaroli''' (born 10 June 1932 in [[Marseille]]), is a French historian and essayist. Fumaroli was elected to the [[Académie française]] on 2 March 1995 and became its director. He is also a member of the [[Académie des Inscriptions]], the sister academy devoted to high erudition. Following his appointment to a chair in Seventeenth Century Studies at the University of Paris-IV, La Sorbonne (1980), he was elected to a Chair in Rhetoric and Society in Europe (16th and 17th century) at the [[Collège de France]]. He held it from 1986 to 2002, until mandatory retirement, and is now an emeritus professor. He is acknowledged for the revival of [[Rhetoric]] as field of study of European culture, in a sharp move away from both structuralism and post-modernism. His pioneering work remains ''L'Age De l'Eloquence'' (1980).  This massive work redrew the map of rhetorical scholarship across Europe. Fumaroli was also a member of the [[University of Chicago]]'s Committee on Social Thought.  He is a recipient of the prestigious [[Balzan Prize]], the "Nobel" of the humanities (in 2001). He is a foreign member of the [[British Academy]] and of the [[American Philosophical Society]].

'''Mining engineering''' is an [[engineering]] discipline that applies science and technology to the extraction of [[mineral]]s from the earth. Mining engineering is associated with many other disciplines, such as [[geology]], [[mineral processing]] and [[metallurgy]], [[geotechnical engineering]] and [[surveying]]. A mining engineer may manage any phase of mining operations – from exploration and discovery of the mineral resource, through [[feasibility study]], mine design, development of plans, [[production (economics)|production]] and operations to [[mine closure]].

With the process of [[Mineral extraction]], some amount of [[waste]] and uneconomic material are generated which are the primary source of [[pollution]] in the vicinity of mines. Mining activities by their nature cause a disturbance of the [[natural environment]] in and around which the [[minerals]] are located. [[Mining]] engineers must therefore be concerned not only with the production and processing of mineral [[commodities]], but also with the mitigation of damage to the environment both during and after mining as a result of the change in the mining area.

==History of mining engineering==
From [[prehistoric]] times to the present, [[mining]] has played a significant role in the existence of the [[human race]]. Since the beginning of civilization people have used [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and [[ceramic]]s and, later, [[metal]]s found on or close to the [[Earth|Earth's]] surface. These were used to manufacture early [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s. For example, high quality [[flint]] found in northern [[France]] and southern [[England]] were used to set [[fire]] and break rock.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, Howard L. ''SME Mining Engineering Handbook'', Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration Inc, 1992, p3.&lt;/ref&gt; Flint mines have been found in [[chalk]] areas where seams of the stone were followed underground by shafts and galleries. The oldest known mine on archaeological record is the "Lion Cave" in [[Swaziland]]. At this site, which [[radiocarbon dating]] indicates to be about 43,000 years old, [[paleolithic]] humans mined mineral [[hematite]], which contained [[iron]] and was ground to produce the red [[pigment]] [[ochre]].&lt;ref&gt;Swaziland Natural Trust Commission, "Cultural Resources – Malolotja Archaeology, Lion Cavern," Retrieved Aug. 27, 2007, {{cite web|url=http://www.sntc.org.sz/cultural/malarch.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221001/http://www.sntc.org.sz/cultural/malarch.asp |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peace Parks Foundation, "Major Features: Cultural Importance." Republic of South Africa: Author. Retrieved Aug. 27, 2007, [http://www.peaceparks.org/story.php?mid=168&amp;pid=148].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] were innovators of [[mining]] engineering. They developed large scale mining methods, such as the use of large volumes of water brought to the minehead by numerous [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] for [[hydraulic mining]]. The exposed rock was then attacked by [[fire-setting]] where fires were used to heat the rock, which would be quenched with a stream of water. The [[thermal shock]] cracked the rock, enabling it to be removed. In some mines the Romans utilized water-powered machinery such as [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]s. These were used extensively in the [[copper]] mines at [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in Spain, where one sequence comprised 16 such wheels arranged in pairs, lifting water about {{convert|80|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romans-in-britain.org.uk/raw_mining.htm ''The Romans in Britain: mining''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720073131/http://www.romans-in-britain.org.uk/raw_mining.htm |date=2010-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[gun powder|Black powder]] was first used in mining in [[Banská Štiavnica]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (present-day [[Slovakia]]) in 1627.&lt;ref&gt;Heiss, A.G. &amp; Oeggl, K. (2008). Analysis of the fuel wood used in Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age copper mining sites of the Schwaz and Brixlegg area (Tyrol, Austria). ''Vegetation History and Archaeobotany'' 17(2):211–221, Springer Berlin / Heidelberg, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-007-0096-8].&lt;/ref&gt;  This allowed blasting of rock and earth to loosen and reveal ore veins, which was much faster than fire-setting. The [[Industrial Revolution]] saw further advances in mining technologies, including improved explosives and [[Steam engine|steam-powered]] pumps, lifts, and drills as long as they remained safe.

==Education==
[[File:Coloradosm.png|1,200 × 800 px|thumb|Students outside [[Colorado School of Mines]] campus]]
There are many ways to become a [[Mining Engineer]] but all include a university degree in [[Mining Engineering]]. Primarily, training includes a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (B.Eng. or B.E.), [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc. or B.S.), [[Bachelor of Technology]] (B.Tech.) or [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] (B.A.Sc.) in Mining Engineering. Depending on the country and jurisdiction, to be licensed as a mining engineer a [[Master's]] degree; [[Master of Engineering]] (M.Eng.), [[Master of Science]] (M.Sc or M.S.) or [[Master of Applied Science]] (M.A.Sc.) maybe required.
There are also mining engineers who have come from other disciplines e.g. from engineering fields like [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Civil Engineering]], [[Electrical Engineering]], [[Geomatics Engineering]], [[Environmental Engineering]] or from science fields like [[Geology]], [[Geophysics]], [[Physics]], [[Geomatics]], [[Earth Science]], [[Mathematics]], However, this path requires taking a [[graduate diploma|graduate]] degree such as M.Eng, M.S., M.Sc. or M.A.Sc. in Mining Engineering after graduating from a different [[quantitative research|quantitative]] [[undergraduate]] program in order to be qualified as a mining engineer.

The fundamental subjects of mining engineering study usually include:

In [[Canada]], [[McGill University]] offers both undergraduate (B.Sc. or B.Eng.) and graduate (M.Sc. or M.S.) degrees in Mining Engineering.&lt;ref name=mcgill&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/mining/graduate-students/prospective/degree-programs/ |title=Graduate Program |publisher=[[McGill University]] |accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of British Columbia]] in [[Vancouver]] offers a [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] (B.A.Sc.) in Mining Engineering&lt;ref name=ubc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://you.ubc.ca/ubc_programs/mining-engineering/ |title=Mining Engineering at UBC |publisher=[[University of British Columbia]] |accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also graduate degrees (M.A.Sc. or M.Eng and Ph.D.) in Mining Engineering.&lt;ref name=bc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mining.ubc.ca/graduate/ |title=Graduate |publisher=[[University of British Columbia]] |accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Europe]] most programs are integrated (B.S. plus M.S. into one) after the [[Bologna Process]] and take 5 years to complete. In [[Portugal]], the [[University of Porto]] offers a M.Eng. in Mining and Geo-Environmental Engineering&lt;ref name=feup&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_ano_lectivo=2017&amp;pv_origem=CUR&amp;pv_tipo_cur_sigla=M&amp;pv_curso_id=739/ |title=Master in Mining and Geo-Environmental Engineering |publisher=[[University of Porto]] |accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Spain]] the [[Technical University of Madrid]] offers degrees in Mining Engineering with tracks in Mining Technology, Mining Operations, Fuels and Explosives, Metallurgy.&lt;ref name=madrid&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upm.es/internacional/Students/StudiesDegrees/University%20Masters/Master%20programs?id=6.7&amp;fmt=detail/ |title=Mining Engineering |publisher=[[Technical University of Madrid]] |accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[South Africa]], the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] offers a 4-year Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.Sc.(Eng.)) in Mining Engineering&lt;ref name=wits&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wits.ac.za/miningeng/undergraduates/ |title=WITS Mining - Undergraduate Programme |publisher=[[University of the Witwatersrand]] |accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as graduate programs (M.Sc.(Eng.) and Ph.D.) in Mining Engineering.&lt;ref name=uwits&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wits.ac.za/miningeng/postgraduates/ |title=WITS Mining - Postgraduate Programme |publisher=[[University of the Witwatersrand]] |accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Mining Engineers go on to pursue [[Doctorate]] degree programs such as [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D., DPhil), [[Doctor of Engineering]] (D.Eng., Eng.D.) these programs involve a very significant original research component and are usually seen as entry points into [[Academia]].

==Salary and statistics==
Mining salaries are usually determined by the level of skill required, where the position is, and what kind of organization the engineer is working for.{{cn|date=May 2017}} When comparing salaries from one region to another, cost of living and other factors need to be taken into consideration.

Mineral exploration is the process of finding [[ore]]s (commercially viable concentrations of minerals) to [[mining|mine]]. Mineral exploration is a much more intensive, organized and professional form of mineral [[prospecting]] and, though it frequently uses the services of prospecting, the process of mineral exploration on the whole is much more involved.

The foremost stage of mining starts with the process of finding and exploration of the mineral deposit. In the initial process of mineral exploration, however, the role of [[geologists]] and [[surveying|surveyors]] is prominent in the [[pre-feasibility study]] of the future mining operation. Mineral exploration and estimation of reserve through various prospecting methods are done to determine the method and type of mining in addition to profitability condition.

===Mineral discovery===
Once a mineral discovery has been made, and has been determined to be of sufficient economic quality to mine, mining engineers will then work on developing a plan to mine this effectively and efficiently.

The discovery can be made from research of mineral maps, academic geological reports or local, state, and national geological reports. Other sources of information include property assays, well drilling logs, and local word of mouth. Mineral research may also include satellite and airborne photographs. Unless the mineral exploration is done on public property, the owners of the property may play a significant role in the exploration process, and may be the original discoverer of the mineral deposit.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Wiliam C, SME: Mining Engineering Handbook, 2nd edition, Volume 1, C1992, "Geologic Prospecting and Exploration," pgs. 221–225, {{ISBN|0-87335-100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mineral determination===
After a prospective mineral is located, the mining geologist and/or mining engineer then determines the ore properties. This may involve chemical analysis of the ore to determine the composition of the sample. Once the mineral properties are identified, the next step is determining the quantity of the ore. This involves determining the extent of the deposit as well as the purity of the ore.&lt;ref&gt;Gumble, Gordon E, Et al. SME: Mining Engineering Handbook, 2nd edition, Volume 1, C1992, "Sample Preparation and Assaying", pgs 327–332, {{ISBN|0-87335-100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geologist drills additional core samples to find the limits of the deposit or seam and calculates the quantity of valuable material present in the deposit.

===Feasibility study===
{{Main|Mining feasibility study}}
Once the mineral identification and reserve amount is reasonably determined, the next step is to determine the [[feasibility study|feasibility]] of recovering the mineral deposit. A preliminary study shortly after the discovery of the deposit examines the market conditions such as the supply and demand of the mineral, the amount of ore needed to be moved to recover a certain quantity of that mineral as well as analysis of the cost associated with the operation. This pre-feasibility study determines whether the mining project is likely to be profitable; if it is then a more in-depth analysis of the deposit is undertaken. After the full extent of the ore body is known and has been examined by engineers, the feasibility study examines the cost of initial capital investment, methods of extraction, the cost of operation, an estimated length of time to payback, the gross revenue and net [[profit margin]], any possible resale price of the land, the total life of the reserve, the total value of the reserve, investment in future projects, and the property owner or owners' contract. In addition, environmental impact, reclamation, possible legal ramifications and all government permitting are considered.&lt;ref&gt;Gentry Donald W., SME: Mining Engineering Handbook, 2nd edition, Volume 1, C1992, "Mine Evaluation and Investment Analysis", pgs 387–389, {{ISBN|0-87335-100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, T. Alan and Stanley C. Suboleski, SME: Mining Engineering Handbook, 2nd edition, Volume 1, C1992, "Costs and Cost Estimation", pgs 405–408, {{ISBN|0-87335-100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These steps of analysis determine whether the mine company should proceed with the extraction of the minerals or whether the project should be abandoned. The mining company may decide to sell the rights to the reserve to a third party rather than develop it themselves, or the decision to proceed with extraction may be postponed indefinitely until market conditions become favorable.

==Mining operation==
Mining engineers working in an established mine may work as an engineer for operations improvement, further [[mineral exploration]], and operation capitalization by determining where in the mine to add equipment and personnel. The engineer may also work in supervision and management, or as an equipment and mineral salesperson. In addition to engineering and operations, the &lt;nowiki&gt;mining engineer&lt;/nowiki&gt; may work as an environmental, health and safety manager or design engineer.

The act of mining required different methods of extraction depending on the [[mineralogy]], [[geology]], and location of the resources. Characteristics such as [[mineral hardness]], the mineral [[stratum|stratification]], and access to that mineral will determine the method of extraction.

Generally, mining is either done from the surface or underground. Mining can also occur with both surface and underground operations taking place on the same reserve. Mining activity varies as to what method is employed to remove the mineral.

===Surface mining===
[[Surface mining]] comprises 90% of the world's mineral tonnage output. Also called [[Open-pit mining|open pit mining]], surface mining is removing minerals in formations that are at or near the surface. Ore retrieval is done by material removal from the land in its natural state. Surface mining often alters the land characteristics, shape, [[topography]], and geological make-up.

Surface mining involves quarrying which is excavating minerals by means of machinery such as cutting, cleaving, and breaking. [[Explosives]] are usually used to facilitate breakage. Hard rocks such as limestone, sand, gravel, and slate are generally quarried into a series of benches.

Strip mining is done on softer minerals such as clays and phosphate are removed through use of mechanical shovels, track dozers, and front end loaders. Softer Coal seams can also be extracted this way.

With [[placer mining]], minerals can also be removed from the bottoms of lakes, rivers, streams, and even the ocean by dredge mining. In addition, [[in-situ]] mining can be done from the surface using dissolving agents on the ore body and retrieving the ore via pumping. The pumped material is then set to leach for further processing. Hydraulic mining is utilized in forms of water jets to wash away either overburden or the ore itself.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Bohnet, SME: Mining Engineering Handbook, 2nd edition, Volume 2, C1992, "Surface Mining: Comparison of Methods", pgs 1529–1538, {{ISBN|0-87335-100-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining process===
Blasting:&lt;br&gt;
[[Explosive]]s are used to break up a rock formation and aid in the collection of [[ore]] in a process called [[Rock blasting|blasting]].  Blasting utilizes the heat and immense pressure of the detonated explosives to shatter and fracture a rock mass. The type of explosives used in mining are [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosives]] which vary in composition and performance properties.  The mining engineer is responsible for the selection and proper placement of these explosives, in order to maximize efficiency and safety.  Blasting occurs in many phases of the mining process, such as development of infrastructure as well as production of the ore.

Leaching:&lt;br&gt;
[[Leaching (metallurgy)|Leaching]] is the loss or extraction of certain materials from a carrier into a liquid (usually, but not always a solvent). Mostly used in rare-earth metals extraction.

Flotation:&lt;br&gt;
[[Froth flotation#Mining|Flotation]] (also spelled floatation) involves phenomena related to the relative buoyancy of minerals.It is the most widely used metal separate method.

Electrostatic separation:&lt;br&gt;
[[Electrostatic separator|Separating]] minerals by electro-characteristic differences.

Gravity separation:&lt;br&gt;
[[Gravity separation]] is an industrial method of separating two components, either a suspension, or dry granular mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical.

Magnetic separation:&lt;br&gt;
[[Magnetic separation]] is a process in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force. 

Hydraulic separation:&lt;br&gt;
[[Hydraulic separation]] is a process that using the density difference to separate minerals. Before hydraulic separation, minerals were crushed into uniform size; because minerals have uniform size and different density will have different settling velocities in water, and that can be used to separate target minerals.

==Mining health and safety==
{{globalize/USA|date=December 2010}}
{{Main|Mine Safety and Health Administration}}
Legal attention to Mining Health and Safety began in the late 19th century and in the subsequent 20th century progressed to a comprehensive and stringent codification of enforcement and mandatory health and safety regulation. A mining engineer in whatever role they occupy must follow all federal, state, and local mine safety laws.

===United States===
{{Main|Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977}}
The United States Congress, through the passage of the Federal [[Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977]], known as the Miner's Act, created the [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA) under the [[US Department of Labor]].

This comprehensive Act provides miners with rights against retaliation for reporting violations, consolidated regulation of coal mines with metallic and nonmetallic mines, and created the independent [[Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission]] to review MSHA's reported violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/MSHAINF2.HTM|title=History of Mine Safety and Health Legislation|author=|date=|website=www.msha.gov|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act as codified in Code of Federal Regulations § 30 (CFR § 30) covers all miners at an active mine. When a mining engineer works at an active mine he or she is subject to the same rights, violations, mandatory health and safety regulations, and mandatory training as any other worker at the mine. The mining engineer can be legally identified as a "miner."&lt;ref&gt;20 CFR § 46.2(g)(1)(i)(ii)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act establishes the rights of miners. The miner may report at any time a hazardous condition and request an inspection. The miners may elect a miners' representative to participate during an inspection, pre-inspection meeting, and post-inspection conference. The miners and miners' representative shall be paid for their time during all inspections and investigations.&lt;ref&gt;The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, § 103(f) and (g)(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mining and the environment==
===United States===
{{globalize/USA|date=December 2010}}

Land reclamation is regulated for surface and underground mines according to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. The law creates as a part of the Department of Interior, the Bureau of Surface Mining (OSM). OSM states on their website, “OSM is charged with balancing the nation’s need for continued domestic coal production with protection of the environment.”

The law requires that states set up their own Reclamation Departments and legislate laws related to reclamation for coal mining operations. The states may impose additional regulations and regulate other minerals in addition to coal for land reclamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osmre.gov/AboutUs.htm|title=Your Page Was Not Found on the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement Website|author=|date=|website=www.osmre.gov|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zero dB is an initiative against music torture set up by legal charity [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]], which represents over thirty prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. Zero dB aims to stop torture music by encouraging widespread condemnation of the practice and by calling on governments and the UN to uphold and enforce the Convention Against Torture and other relevant treaties. The initiative is backed by the Musicians Union which is calling on British musicians to voice their outrage against the use of music to torture.

Musicians and the wider public are making their own silent protests against music torture which are being shown on Zero dB. A series of silent protests and actions are planned through 2009. Participating musicians will include minutes of silence in their concerts to draw their audience's attention to the USA's use of deafening music against captives.

According to the ''Associated Press'' [[FBI]] agents stationed at Guantanamo Bay reported that the use of deafening music was common.&lt;ref name=AP2008-12-09/&gt;
According to the ''Associated Press''
Guantanamo Bay spokesmen [[Commander]] [[Pauline Storum]]: 
:{| class="wikitable" border="1"

:''"...wouldn't give details of when and how music has been used at the prison, but said it isn't used today. She didn't respond when asked whether music might be used in the future."&lt;ref name=AP2008-12-09/&gt;
|}

Among the musicians united in their objections were [[Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)|Christopher Cerf]], a composer for the children's show [[Sesame Street]], and [[Tom Morello]]
of [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Audioslave]].&lt;ref name=AP2008-12-09/&gt;

[[File:Celler de Sant Cugat lateral.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Parabolic arches in [[Celler de Sant Cugat]]]]
A '''parabolic arch''' is an [[arch]] shaped like a [[parabola]].&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com"&gt;Article about parabolic arch by The Free Dictionary: [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/parabolic+arch Parabolic arch | Article about parabolic arch by The Free Dictionary], accessdate: March 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Such arches are used in bridges, [[cathedral]]s, and elsewhere in architecture and engineering.

==Description==

===The mathematics===

While a parabolic arch may resemble a [[catenary arch]], a [[parabolic curve|parabola]] is a [[quadratic function]] while a [[catenary]] is the [[hyperbolic cosine]], cosh(''x''), a sum of two [[exponential function]]s.

===The Line of Thrust, why such arches are used===

Unlike a [[catenary arch]], the parabolic [[arch]] employs the principle that when weight is uniformly applied above, the internal compression (see [[line of thrust]]) resulting from that weight will follow a [[parabolic curve]]. Of all arch types, the parabolic arch produces the most thrust at the base. Also, it can span the widest area. It is commonly used in [[bridge]] design, where long spans are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vgprkYFib4AC&amp;pg=PA744|title=Developments in Mechanics of Structures &amp; Materials|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ebooks.narotama.ac.id-file1&gt;[http://ebooks.narotama.ac.id/files/The%20Design%20of%20Prestressed%20Concrete%20Bridges/Chapter%2017%20The%20Design%20And%20Construction%20Of%20Arches.pdf The Design of Prestressed Concrete Bridges/Chapter 17 The Design And Construction Of Arches]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compared to catenary arches===

When an arch carries a uniformly distributed vertical load, the correct shape is a parabola. When an arch carries only its own weight, the best shape is a [[catenary arch|catenary]].&lt;ref name=ebooks.narotama.ac.id-file1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2020">In [[thermal equilibrium]], each [[phase (matter)|phase]] (i.e. [[liquid]], [[solid]] etc.) of physical [[matter]] comes to an end at a transitional point, or spatial [[interface (matter)|interface]], called a '''phase boundary''', due to the [[immiscibility]] of the matter with the matter on the other side of the boundary.  This immiscibility is due to at least one difference between the two substances' corresponding physical properties. The behavior of phase boundaries has been a developing subject of interest and an active research field, called interface science, in [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] for almost two centuries, due partly to phase boundaries naturally arising in many physical processes, such as the [[capillarity effect]], the growth of [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]], the physics of [[binary alloy]]s, and the formation of [[snow flake]]s. 

One of the oldest problems in the area dates back to Lamé and Clapeyron&lt;ref&gt;[[Gabriel Lamé|G. Lamé]], [[Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron|B. P. Clapeyron]], Memoire sur la solidification par refroiddissement d'un globe solide, Ann. Chem. Physics, 47, 250–256  (1831).&lt;/ref&gt; who studied the freezing of the ground. Their goal was to determine the thickness of solid crust generated by the cooling of a liquid at constant [[temperature]] filling the [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]]. In 1889, Stefan, while working on the freezing of the ground developed these ideas further and formulated the two-phase model which came to be known as the [[Stefan problem | Stefan Problem]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Josef Stefan|J. Stefan]], Über einige Probleme der Theorie der Warmeleitung, S.-B Wien Akad. Mat. Natur, 98, 173–484, (1889).&lt;/ref&gt;

The proof of existence and uniqueness of a solution to the [[Stefan problem]] was done in many stages. Proving the general existence and uniqueness of the solutions in the case of &lt;math&gt;d=3&lt;/math&gt; was solved by [[Shoshana Kamin]].

'''Revivalism''' in [[architecture]] is the use of visual styles that consciously echo the style of a [[Architectural style|previous architectural era]].

Modern-day revival styles can be summarized within [[New Classical Architecture]], and sometimes under the umbrella term traditional architecture.

In [[algebra]] and [[theoretical computer science]], an '''action''' or '''act''' of a '''[[semigroup]]''' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] is a rule which associates to each element of the semigroup a [[transformation (geometry)|transformation]] of the set in such a way that the product of two elements of the semigroup (using the semigroup [[binary operation|operation]]) is associated with the [[function composition|composite]] of the two corresponding transformations. The terminology conveys the idea that the elements of the semigroup are ''acting'' as transformations of the set. From an [[algebraic structure|algebraic]] perspective, a semigroup action is a generalization of the notion of a [[group action]] in [[group (mathematics)|group theory]]. From the computer science point of view, semigroup actions are closely related to [[finite state machine|automata]]: the set models the state of the automaton and the action models transformations of that state in response to inputs.

An important special case is a '''monoid action''' or '''act''', in which the semigroup is a [[monoid]] and the [[identity element]] of the monoid acts as the [[identity transformation]] of a set. From a [[category theoretic]] point of view, a monoid is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with one object, and an act is a functor from that category to the [[category of sets]]. This immediately provides a generalization to monoid acts on objects in categories other than the category of sets.

Another important special case is a '''[[transformation semigroup]]'''. This is a semigroup of transformations of a set, and hence it has a tautological action on that set. This concept is linked to the more general notion of a semigroup by an analogue of [[Cayley's theorem]].

''(A note on terminology: the terminology used in this area varies, sometimes significantly, from one author to another. See the article for details.)''

==Formal definitions==

Let ''S'' be a semigroup. Then a (left) '''semigroup action''' (or '''act''') of ''S'' is a set ''X'' together with an operation {{nowrap|• : ''S'' × ''X'' → ''X''}} which is compatible with the semigroup [[binary operation|operation]] * as follows:
* for all ''s'', ''t'' in ''S'' and ''x'' in ''X'', {{nowrap|1=''s'' • (''t'' • ''x'') = (''s'' * ''t'') • ''x''}}.
This is the analogue in semigroup theory of a (left) [[group action]], and is equivalent to a [[semigroup#Semigroup homomorphisms|semigroup homomorphism]] into the set of functions on ''X''. Right semigroup actions are defined in a similar way using an operation {{nowrap|• : ''X'' × ''S'' → ''X''}} satisfying {{nowrap|1=(''x'' • ''a'') • ''b'' = ''x'' • (''a'' * ''b'')}}.

If ''M'' is a monoid, then a (left) '''monoid action''' (or '''act''') of ''M'' is a (left) semigroup action of ''M'' with the additional property that
* for all ''x'' in ''X'': ''e'' • ''x'' = ''x''
where ''e'' is the identity element of ''M''. This correspondingly gives a monoid homomorphism. Right monoid actions are defined in a similar way. A monoid ''M'' with an action on a set is also called an '''operator monoid'''.

A semigroup action of ''S'' on ''X'' can be made into monoid act by adjoining an identity to the semigroup and requiring that it acts as the identity transformation on ''X''. 

===Terminology and notation===

If ''S'' is a semigroup or monoid, then a set ''X'' on which ''S'' acts as above (on the left, say) is also known as a (left) '''''S''-act''', '''''S''-set''', '''''S''-action''', '''''S''-operand''', or '''left act over ''S'''''. Some authors do not distinguish between semigroup and monoid actions, by regarding the identity axiom ({{nowrap|1=''e'' • ''x'' = ''x''}}) as empty when there is no identity element, or by using the term '''unitary ''S''-act''' for an ''S''-act with an identity.&lt;ref&gt;Kilp, Knauer and Mikhalev, 2000, pages 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, since a monoid is a semigroup, one can consider semigroup actions of monoids.

The defining property of an act is analogous to the [[associativity]] of the semigroup operation, and means that all parentheses can be omitted. It is common practice, especially in computer science, to omit the operations as well so that both the semigroup operation and the action are indicated by juxtaposition. In this way  [[string (computer science)|strings]] of letters from ''S'' act on ''X'', as in the expression ''stx'' for ''s'', ''t'' in ''S'' and ''x'' in ''X''.

It is also quite common to work with right acts rather than left acts.&lt;ref&gt;Kilp, Knauer and Mikhalev, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; However, every right S-act can be interpreted as a left act over the '''opposite semigroup''', which has the same elements as S, but where multiplication is defined by reversing the factors, {{nowrap|1=''s'' • ''t'' = ''t'' • ''s''}}, so the two notions are essentially equivalent. Here we primarily adopt the point of view of left acts.

===Acts and transformations===

It is often convenient (for instance if there is more than one act under consideration) to use a letter, such as &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, to denote the function
:&lt;math&gt; T\colon S\times X \to X&lt;/math&gt;
defining the &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;-action and hence write &lt;math&gt;T(s, x)&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;s\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;. Then for any &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, we denote by
:&lt;math&gt; T_s\colon X \to X&lt;/math&gt;
the transformation of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt; T_s(x) = T(s,x).&lt;/math&gt;
By the defining property of an &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;-act, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
:&lt;math&gt; T_{s*t} = T_s\circ T_t.&lt;/math&gt;
Further, consider a function &lt;math&gt;s\mapsto T_s&lt;/math&gt;. It is the same as &lt;math&gt;curry(T):S\to(X\to X)&lt;/math&gt; (see [[currying]]). Because &lt;math&gt;curry&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection, semigroup actions can be defined as functions &lt;math&gt;S\to(X\to X)&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies
:&lt;math&gt; curry(T)(s*t) = curry(T)(s)\circ curry(T)(t).&lt;/math&gt;
I.e. &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a semigroup action of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;curry(T)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[semigroup homomorphism]] from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to the full transformation monoid of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

===''S''-homomorphisms===

Let ''X'' and ''X''′ be ''S''-acts. Then an ''S''-homomorphism from ''X'' to ''X''′ is a map
:&lt;math&gt;F\colon X\to X'&lt;/math&gt;
such that 
:&lt;math&gt;F(sx) =s F(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;s\in S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.
The set of all such ''S''-homomorphisms is commonly written as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}_S(X,X')&lt;/math&gt;.

''M''-homomorphisms of ''M''-acts, for ''M'' a monoid, are defined in exactly the same way.

===''S''-Act and ''M''-Act===

For a fixed semigroup ''S'', the left ''S''-acts are the objects of a category, denoted ''S''-Act, whose morphisms are the ''S''-homomorphisms. The corresponding category of right ''S''-acts is sometimes denoted by Act-''S''. (This is analogous to the categories ''R''-Mod and Mod-''R'' of left and right [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].)

For a monoid ''M'', the categories ''M''-Act and Act-''M'' are defined in the same way.

==Examples==
* Any semigroup &lt;math&gt;(S, *)&lt;/math&gt; has an action on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\cdot = *&lt;/math&gt;. The action property holds due to the associativity of &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;.
* More generally, for any semigroup homomorphism &lt;math&gt;F\colon (S, *) \rightarrow (T, \oplus)&lt;/math&gt;, the semigroup &lt;math&gt;(S, *)&lt;/math&gt; has an action on &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;s \cdot t = F(s) \oplus t&lt;/math&gt;.
* For any set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt; be the set of sequences of elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The semigroup &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{N}, \times)&lt;/math&gt; has an action on &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;n \cdot s = s^n&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;s^n&lt;/math&gt; denotes &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; repeated &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times).

==Transformation semigroups==

{{main|Transformation semigroup}}

A correspondence between transformation semigroups and semigroup actions is described below. If we restrict it to [[Faithful action|faithful]] semigroup actions, it has nice properties.

Any transformation semigroup can be turned into a semigroup action by the following construction. For any transformation semigroup &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, define a semigroup action &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;T(s, x) = s(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; s\in S, x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. This action is faithful, which is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;curry(T)&lt;/math&gt; being [[injective]].

Conversely, for any semigroup action &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, define a transformation semigroup &lt;math&gt;S' = \{T_s | s\in S\}&lt;/math&gt;. In this construction we "forget" the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of &lt;math&gt;curry(T)&lt;/math&gt;. Lets denote &lt;math&gt;curry(T)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; for brevity. If &lt;math&gt;curry(T)&lt;/math&gt; is [[injective]], then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a semigroup [[isomorphism]] from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, if &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is faithful, then we forget nothing important. This claim is made precise by the following observation: if we turn &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; back into a semigroup action &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T'(f(s), x)=T(s, x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; s\in S, x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; are "isomorphic" via &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., we essentially recovered &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Thus some authors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Applications to computer science==
===Semiautomata===

{{main|semiautomaton}}

Transformation semigroups are of essential importance for the structure theory of [[finite state machine]]s in [[automata theory]]. In particular, a ''semiautomaton'' is a triple (''Σ'',''X'',''T''), where ''Σ'' is a non-empty set called the ''input alphabet'', ''X'' is a non-empty set called the ''set of states'' and ''T'' is a function
:&lt;math&gt;T\colon \Sigma\times X \to X&lt;/math&gt;
called the ''transition function''. Semiautomata arise from [[deterministic finite automaton|deterministic automata]] by ignoring the initial state and the set of accept states.

Given a semiautomaton, let ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;: ''X'' → ''X'', for ''a'' ∈ ''Σ'', denote the transformation of ''X'' defined by ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''T''(''a'',''x''). Then the semigroup of transformations of ''X'' generated by {''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''a'' ∈ ''Σ''} is called the ''[[characteristic semigroup]]'' or ''transition system'' of (''Σ'',''X'',''T''). This semigroup is a monoid, so this monoid is called the ''characteristic'' or ''[[transition monoid]]''. It is also sometimes viewed as an ''Σ''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;-act on ''X'', where ''Σ''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[free monoid]] of strings generated by the alphabet ''Σ'' and the action of strings extends the action of ''Σ'' via the property
:&lt;math&gt;T_{vw} = T_w \circ T_v.&lt;/math&gt;

===Krohn–Rhodes theory===

{{main|Krohn–Rhodes theory}}

Krohn–Rhodes theory, sometimes also called ''algebraic automata theory'', gives powerful decomposition results for finite transformation semigroups by cascading simpler components.

A '''sign''' is an [[Physical body|object]], [[quality (philosophy)|quality]], event, or [[entity]] whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else.&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; A natural sign bears a causal relation to its object—for instance, [[thunder]] is a sign of storm, or medical [[symptom]]s signify a disease. A conventional sign signifies by agreement, as a [[full stop]] signifies the end of a sentence; similarly the words and expressions of a [[language]], as well as bodily [[gesture]]s, can be regarded as signs, expressing particular [[Meaning (linguistics)|meanings]]. The physical objects most commonly referred to as signs (notices, [[road sign]]s, etc., collectively known as [[signage]]) generally inform or instruct using [[written text]], [[symbol]]s, [[picture]]s or a combination of these.

The philosophical study of signs and [[symbol]]s is called [[semiotics]]; this includes the study of [[semiosis]], which is the way in which [[sign (semiotics)|signs (in the semiotic sense)]] operate.

==Nature==
{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2018}}
[[Semiotics]], [[epistemology]], logic, and [[philosophy of language]] are concerned about the nature of signs, what they are and how they signify.  The nature of signs and symbols and significations, their definition, elements, and types, is mainly established by [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and [[Aquinas]]. According to these classic sources, significance is a relationship between two sorts of things: signs and the kinds of things they signify (intend, express or mean), where one term necessarily causes something else to come to the mind. Distinguishing natural signs and conventional signs, the traditional theory of signs ([[Augustine]]) sets the following threefold partition of things:
all sorts of indications, evidences, symptoms, and physical signals, there are signs which are ''always'' signs (the entities of the mind as ideas and images, thoughts and feelings, constructs and intentions); and there are signs that ''have'' to get their signification (as linguistic entities and cultural symbols). So, while natural signs serve as the source of signification, the human mind is the agency through which signs signify naturally occurring things, such as objects, states, qualities, quantities, events, processes, or relationships. Human [[language]] and [[discourse]], [[communication]], [[philosophy]], [[science]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[poetry]], [[theology]], and [[religion]] are only some of fields of human study and activity where grasping the nature of signs and symbols and patterns of signification may have a decisive value. Communication takes place without words but via the mind as a result of signs and symbols; They communicate/pass across/ messages to the human mind through their pictorial representation.

== Christianity ==

===St. Augustine and signs===
[[St. Augustine]] was the first man who synthesized the classical and Hellenistic theories of signs. For him a sign is a thing which is used to signify other things and to make them come to mind (''[[De Doctrina Christiana]]'' (hereafter DDC) 1.2.2; 2.1.1). The most common signs are spoken and written words (DDC 1.2.2; 2.3.4-2.4.5). Although God cannot be fully expressible, Augustine gave emphasis to the possibility of God’s communication with humans by signs in Scripture (DDC 1.6.6).  Augustine endorsed and developed the classical and Hellenistic theories of signs.  Among the mainstream in the theories of signs, i.e., that of Aristotle and that of Stoics, the former theory filtered into the works of Cicero (106-43 BC, ''De inventione rhetorica'' 1.30.47-48) and Quintilian (circa 35-100, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 5.9.9-10), which regarded the sign as an instrument of inference.  In his commentary on Aristotle’s ''De Interpretatione'', Ammonius said, "according to the division of the philosopher Theophrastus, the relation of speech is twofold, first in regard to the audience, to which speech signifies something, and secondly in regard to the things about which the speaker intends to persuade the audience." If we match DDC with this division, the first part belongs to DDC Book IV and the second part to DDC Books I-III. Augustine, although influenced by these theories, advanced his own theological theory of signs, with whose help one can infer the mind of God from the events and words of Scripture.

Books II and III of DDC enumerate all kinds of signs and explain how to interpret them. Signs are divided into natural (''naturalia'') and conventional (''data''); the latter is divided into animal (''bestiae'') and human (''homines''); the latter is divided into non-words (''cetera'') and words (''verba''); the latter is divided into spoken words (''voces'') and written words (''litterae''); the latter is divided into unknown signs (''signa ignota'') and ambiguous signs (''signa ambigua''); both the former and the latter are divided respectively into particular signs (''signa propria'') and figurative signs (''signa translata''), among which the unknown figurative signs belong to the pagans.
In addition to exegetical knowledge (Quintilian, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 1.4.1-3 and 1.8.1-21) which follows the order of reading (''lectio''), textual criticism (''emendatio''), explanation (''enarratio''), and judgment (''iudicium''),  one needs to know the original language (Hebrew and Greek) and broad background information on Scripture (DDC 2.9.14-2.40.60).

Augustine’s understanding of signs includes several hermeneutical presuppositions as important factors. First, the interpreter should proceed with humility, because only a humble person can grasp the truth of Scripture (DDC 2.41.62). Second, the interpreter must have a spirit of active inquiry and should not hesitate to learn and use pagan education for the purpose of leading to Christian learning,  because all truth is God’s truth (DDC 2.40.60-2.42.63). Third, the heart of interpreter should be founded, rooted, and built up in love which is the final goal of the entire Scriptures (DDC 2.42.63).

The sign does not function as its own goal, but its purpose lies in its role as a signification (''res significans'', DDC 3.9.13). God gave signs as a means to reveal himself; Christians need to exercise hermeneutical principles in order to understand that divine revelation. Even if the Scriptural text is obscure, it has meaningful benefits. For the obscure text prevents us from falling into pride, triggers our intelligence (DDC 2.6.7), tempers our faith in the history of revelation (DDC 3.8.12), and refines our mind to be suitable to the holy mysteries (DDC 4.8.22). When interpreting signs, the literal meaning should first be sought, and then the figurative meaning (DDC 3.10.14-3.23.33). Augustine suggests the hermeneutical principle that the obscure Scriptural verse is interpreted with the help of plain and simple verses, which formed the doctrine of "scriptura scripturae interpres" (Scripture is the Interpreter of Scripture) in the Reformation Era. Moreover, he introduces the seven rules of Tyconius the Donatist to interpret the obscure meaning of the Bible, which demonstrates his understanding that all truth belongs to God (DDC 3.3.42-3.37.56). In order to apply Augustine's hermeneutics of the sign appropriately in modern times, every division of theology must be involved and interdisciplinary approaches must be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B.

'''Sonari''' is the archaeological site of an ancient monastic complex of [[Buddhist]] [[stupa]]s. The site, positioned on a hill, is located about 10km southwest of [[Sanchi]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]].&lt;ref name = "ASI"&gt; [http://www.asibhopal.nic.in/monument/raisen_Sonari_buddhistacentland.html ASI Sonari page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The stupas were excavated around 1850 by [[Alexander Cunningham]], who discovered two boxes containing relics.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/other/019wdz000000546u00003a00.html British Library Online] &lt;/ref&gt; One of the reliquaries, which is very ornate, is visible nowadays at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].

The reliquary of Stupa No.2 presents has inscriptions in [[Brahmi]] mentioning the names of Buddhist monks also appearing in the reliquary of [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]] and [[Andher Stupas]]: Kasapagota, Majjhima, Kosikiputa, Gotiputa, and Apagira.&lt;ref name = "BA"&gt; Huu Phuoc's Buddhist Architecture The [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA148 p.148] &lt;/ref&gt; It would seem, then, that the ashes of these monks were divided between these three stupas.

The date of construction of Stupa 1 and Stupa 2 must therefore be equivalent to those of [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]], i.e. 125-100 BCE.&lt;Ref name = "BA"/&gt;

There are in all four groups of stupas surrounding Sanchi within a radius of twenty kilometers: Bhojpur and Andher to the southeast, Sonari to the southwest, and Satdhara in the west. &lt;ref name ="BC"&gt; Buddhist Circuit in Central India: Sanchi, Satdhara, Sonari, Andher, Travel ... [https://books.google.fr/books?id=TOrKExVXXpkC&amp;pg=PT3&amp; p31 &lt;/ref&gt; Further south, about 100 km away, is [[Saru Maru]].

Alexander Cunningham and FC Maisey searched Sonari's Stupa No.2 in 1851. The stupa contained three miniature reliquaries, two in soapstone and one in rock crystal, as well as a certain amount of bone ash and a piece of wood. The main reliquary is shaped to resemble a [[Lotus (plant)|lotus]] bud, with incised petals decorating the lower half of the reliquary. It was turned on a [[lathe]] and then carved in [[bas-relief]] with lotus petal strips on the shoulder and lower body, while on the upper body is a large area divided into eight rectangular compartments in each of which are an elephant, horse, deer or winged lion, patterns typical of the period of the [[Maurya Empire]]. These discoveries were published by A Cunningham in ''The Bhilsa Topes'' in 1854.&lt;ref name = "VA"&gt; Notice from [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] [https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O25176/reliquary-unknown/] &lt;/ref&gt;

It had been customary since the death of the Buddha to preserve and venerate his relics. Under emperor [[Ashoka]] (around 268-233 BCE), converted to Buddhism and energetic protector of the faith, a series of stupas, mounds of relics, were erected throughout the empire, marking sites important in the life of the Buddha. This practice continued, and this container of relics was buried around 200 BCE. Relic deposits of this period usually represented original deposits of the relics of the Buddha.&lt;ref name = "VA"/&gt;

In [[architecture]] and [[structural engineering]], a '''space frame''' or '''space structure''' is a rigid, lightweight, [[truss]]-like structure constructed from interlocking [[strut]]s in a [[geometry|geometric]] [[pattern]]. Space frames can be used to span large areas with few interior supports.  Like the [[truss]], a space frame is strong because of the inherent rigidity of the triangle; flexing [[Structural load|load]]s (bending [[moment (physics)|moments]]) are transmitted as [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] and [[compression (physical)|compression]] loads along the length of each strut.
Steel space frames provide great freedom of expression and composition as well as the possibility to evenly distribute loads along each rod and external constraints.
With these features, steel space frames can be used to achieve also complex geometries with a structural weight lower than any other solution. The inner highly hyper-static system provides an increased resistance to damages caused by fire, explosions, shocks and earthquakes.
Space frames are modular and made of highly industrialized elements designed with a remarkable dimensional accuracy and precise surface finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tetrasteel|title=Space frame structures|url=https://www.tetrasteel.com/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design methods==
Space frames are typically designed using a [[rigidity matrix]]. The special characteristic of the [[stiffness matrix]] in an architectural space frame is the independence of the angular factors.  If the joints are sufficiently rigid, the angular deflections can be neglected, simplifying the calculations.

==Overview==
[[Image:SpaceFrame02.png|right|thumb|250px|Simplified space frame roof with the half-octahedron highlighted in blue]]
The simplest form of space frame is a horizontal slab of interlocking [[square pyramid]]s and [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]] built from [[aluminium]] or tubular [[steel]] struts. In many ways this looks like the horizontal jib of a tower crane repeated many times to make it wider.  A stronger form is composed of interlocking [[Tetrahedron|tetrahedra]] in which all the struts have unit length. More technically this is referred to as an isotropic vector matrix or in a single unit width an octet truss. More complex variations change the lengths of the struts to curve the overall structure or may incorporate other geometrical shapes.

==Types==
Within the meaning of space frame, we can find three systems clearly different between them:&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;Otero C. (1990). "Diseño geométrico de cúpulas no esféricas aproximadas por mallas triangulares, con un número mínimo de longitudes de barra". Tesis Doctoral. Universidad de Cantabria.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Curvature classification'''

* Space plane covers. These spatial structures are composed of planar substructures. Their behavior is similar to that of a plate in which the deflections in the plane are channeled through the horizontal bars and the shear forces are supported by the diagonals.&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;Cavia Sorret (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Tirumailai MRTS station Chennai (Madras).jpg|thumb|right|250px|This train station is supported by a barrel vaults structure.]]

* Barrel vaults. This type of vault has a cross section of a simple arch. Usually this type of space frame does not need to use tetrahedral modules or pyramids as a part of its backing.
* Spherical domes and other compound curves usually require the use of tetrahedral modules or pyramids and additional support from a skin.

'''Classification by the arrangement of its elements'''

* Single layer grid. All elements are located on the surface to be approximated.
* Double layer grid. The elements are organized in two layers parallel to each other at a certain distance apart. Each of the layers form a lattice of triangles, squares or hexagons in which the projection of the nodes in a layer may overlap or be displaced relative to each other. Diagonal bars connect the nodes of both layers in different directions in space. In this type of meshes, the elements are associated into three groups: upper cordon, cordon and cordon lower diagonal.
* Triple layer grid. Elements are placed in three parallel layers, linked by the diagonals. They are almost always flat.

Other examples we could attach with the definition of space frame are these:

* Pleated metallic structures. Emerged to try to solve the problems that formwork and pouring concrete had their counterparts. Typically run with welded joint, but may raise prefabricated joints, a fact which makes them space meshes.
* Hanging covers. Designs on the cable taut, spine, and the [[catenary arch]] antifunicular show their ability to channel forces theoretically better than any other alternative, have an infinite range of possibilities for composition and adaptability to any type of plant cover or ensure vain. However, imprecisions in shape having the loaded strand (ideally adapts dynamically to the state of charge) and the risk of bending the arc to unexpected stresses are problems that require pre-compression and prestressing elements. Although in most cases tend to be the cheapest and the technical solution that best fits the acoustics and ventilation of the covered enclosure, are vulnerable to vibration.
* Pneumatic structures. Wherein the closure membrane is subjected to a pressurized state, may be considered within this group.

==Applications==

===Construction===
Space frames are a common feature in modern building construction; they are often found in large roof spans in [[Modernism|modernist]] commercial and industrial buildings.

Examples of buildings based on space frames include:
* [[Stansted airport]], by [[Foster and Partners]]
* [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]] and the [[Louvre Pyramid]], by [[I. M. Pei]]
* [[Rogers Centre]] by [[Rod Robbie]] and [[Michael Allen (architect)|Michael Allan]]
* [[McCormick Place]] East in [[Chicago]]
* [[Eden Project]] in Cornwall, England
* [[Ericsson Globe|Globen]], Sweden - Dome with diameter of 110 m, (1989)
* [[Biosphere 2]] by [[John P. Allen]], [[Phil Hawes]], [[Peter Jon Pearce]] in Oracle, Arizona
* [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]], [[New York City, New York]]
* [[Sochi International Airport]] in [[Sochi]], [[Russia]]
* Entrance to [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]]

Large portable stages and lighting [[Crane (machine)#Gantry crane|gantries]] are also frequently built from space frames and octet trusses.

===Vehicles===
[[Image:Yeoman YA-1 vs CA-6 Wackett frame.jpg|thumb|Yeoman YA-1 vs CA-6 Wackett frames.]]

==== Aircraft ====
The CAC CA-6 Wackett and Yeoman YA-1 Cropmaster 250R aircraft were built using roughly the same welded steel tube fuselage frame.

==== Cars ====
Spaceframes are sometimes used in the chassis designs of [[automobiles]] and [[motorcycles]]. In both a spaceframe and a tube-frame chassis, the suspension, engine, and body panels are attached to a skeletal frame of tubes, and the body panels have little or no structural function. By contrast, in a [[unibody]] or [[monocoque]] design, the body serves as part of the structure.

Tube-frame chassis pre-date spaceframe chassis and are a development of the earlier [[ladder chassis]]. The advantage of using tubes rather than the previous open channel sections is that they resist [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]]al forces better. Some tube chassis were little more than a ladder chassis made with two large diameter tubes, or even a single tube as a [[backbone chassis]]. Although many tubular chassis developed additional tubes and were even described as "spaceframes", their design was rarely correctly stressed as a spaceframe and they behaved mechanically as a tube ladder chassis, with additional brackets to support the attached components, suspension, engine etc. The distinction of the true spaceframe is that all the forces in each strut are either tensile or compression, never bending.&lt;ref name="Ludvigsen, Colin Chapman, 153" /&gt; Although these additional tubes did carry some extra load, they were rarely diagonalised into a rigid spaceframe.&lt;ref name="Ludvigsen, Colin Chapman, 153" &gt;{{harvnb|Ludvigsen|Colin Chapman|page=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first true spaceframe chassis were produced in the  1930s by designers such as [[Buckminster Fuller]] and [[William Bushnell Stout]] (the [[Dymaxion car|Dymaxion]] and the [[Stout Scarab]]) who understood the theory of the true spaceframe from either architecture or aircraft design.&lt;ref name="Ludvigsen, Colin Chapman, 150" &gt;{{Cite book |title=Colin Chapman: Inside the Innovator |last=Ludvigsen |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Ludvigsen |publisher=Haynes Publishing |year=2010 |isbn=1-84425-413-5 |ref={{harvid|Ludvigsen|Colin Chapman}} |pages=150–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first racing car to attempt a spaceframe was the [[Cisitalia D46]] of 1946.&lt;ref name="Ludvigsen, Colin Chapman, 150" /&gt; This used two small diameter tubes along each side, but they were spaced apart by vertical smaller tubes, and so were not diagonalised in any plane. A year later, Porsche designed their [[Porsche 360|Type 360]] for [[Cisitalia]]. As this included diagonal tubes, it can be considered the first true spaceframe.&lt;ref name="Ludvigsen, Colin Chapman, 150" /&gt;
[[File:Jaguar C-Type Frame.JPG|thumb|right|Jaguar C-Type frame]]
The Maserati Tipo 61 of 1959 (Birdcage) is often thought of as the first but in 1949 Dr. Robert Eberan-Eberhorst designed the [[Jowett Jupiter]] exhibited at the [[London Motor Show]] in 1949 and taking a class win at the 1950 Le Mans 24hr. Later the small British car manufacturers developed the concept [[TVR]] produced an alloy-bodied two seater on a multi tubular chassis, which appeared in 1949.

[[Colin Chapman]] of [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] introduced his first 'production' car, the [[Lotus Mark VI|Mark VI]], in 1952. This was influenced by the [[Jaguar C-Type]] chassis, another with four tubes of two different diameters, separated by narrower tubes. Chapman reduced the main tube diameter for the lighter Lotus, but did not reduce the minor tubes any further, possibly because he considered that this would appear flimsy to buyers.&lt;ref name="Ludvigsen, Colin Chapman, 153" /&gt; Although widely described as a spaceframe, Lotus did not build a true spaceframe chassis until the [[Lotus Mark VIII|Mark VIII]], with the influence of other designers, with experience from the aircraft industry.&lt;ref name="Ludvigsen, Colin Chapman, 153" /&gt;

Other notable examples of space frame cars include the [[Audi A8]], [[Audi R8]], [[Ferrari 360]], [[Lamborghini Gallardo]], [[Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG]], [[Pontiac Fiero]] and [[Saturn S-Series]].
[[Image:Kitcar (8906407466).jpg|thumb|Chilean kitcar showing off its spaceframe structure (2013).]]
A large number of [[kit car]]s, possibly the majority made in the UK, use space frame construction, because manufacture in small quantity requires only simple and inexpensive [[jig (tool)|jig]]s, and it is relatively easy for an amateur designer to achieve good stiffness with a space frame. Generally the space frames are [[Metal inert gas welding|MIG]] welded, although the more expensive kits often use [[Gas tungsten arc welding|TIG]] welding, a slower and more highly skilled process. Many of these resemble the Lotus Mark VII in general outline and mechanical layout, however others are close replicas of the [[AC Cobra]] or Italian [[supercars]], but some are original designs resembling no other vehicle. Often, considerable effort has been made by the designers to produce true space frames, with all points of significant load braced in 3 dimensions, resulting in strength and stiffness comparable to, or better than, typical production cars. Others are tube frames but not true space frames because they use relatively large diameter tubes, often curved, which are carrying bending loads, but due to the large diameter remain adequately rigid. However some inferior designs are not true space frames, because the tubes are carrying considerable bending loads.  This will result in considerable flexing due to dynamic loads, and ultimately [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] fracture, a failure mechanism which is rare in a correctly designed true space frame. The reduced stiffness will also impair the handling.

A drawback of the spaceframe chassis is that it encloses much of the working volume of the car and can make access for both the driver and to the engine difficult. Some spaceframes have been designed with removable sections, joined by bolted pin joints. Such a structure had already been used around the engine of the [[Lotus Mark III]].&lt;ref name="Ludvigsen, Colin Chapman, 151" &gt;{{harvnb|Ludvigsen|Colin Chapman|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although somewhat inconvenient, an advantage of the spaceframe is that the same lack of bending forces in the tubes that allow it to be modelled as a [[pin-jointed truss|pin-jointed structure]] also means that such a removable section need not reduce the strength of the assembled frame.

== Miller's article ==
In his article, Miller discussed a coincidence between the limits of one-dimensional absolute judgment and the limits of short-term memory. In a one-dimensional absolute-judgment task, a person is presented with a number of stimuli that vary on one dimension (e.g., 10 different tones varying only in pitch) and responds to each stimulus with a corresponding response (learned before). Performance is nearly perfect up to five or six different stimuli but declines as the number of different stimuli is increased. The task can be described as one of information transmission: The input consists of one out of ''n'' possible stimuli, and the output consists of one out of ''n'' responses. The information contained in the input can be determined by the number of binary decisions that need to be made to arrive at the selected stimulus, and the same holds for the response. Therefore, people's maximum performance on one-dimensional absolute judgement can be characterized as an information channel capacity with approximately 2 to 3 [[bit]]s of [[information]], which corresponds to the ability to distinguish between four and eight alternatives.

The second cognitive limitation Miller discusses is [[memory span]]. Memory span refers to the longest list of items (e.g., digits, letters, words) that a person can repeat back  in correct order on 50% of trials immediately after presentation. Miller observed that memory span of young adults is approximately seven items. He noticed that memory span is approximately the same for stimuli with vastly different amount of information—for instance, binary digits have 1 bit each; decimal digits have 3.32 bits each; words have about 10 bits each. Miller concluded that memory span is not limited in terms of bits but rather in terms of [[Chunking (psychology)|chunks]]. A chunk is the largest meaningful unit in the presented material that the person recognizes—thus, what counts as a chunk depends on the knowledge of the person being tested. For instance, a word is a single chunk for a speaker of the language but is many chunks for someone who is totally unfamiliar with the language and sees the word as a collection of phonetic segments.

Miller recognized that the correspondence between the limits of one-dimensional absolute judgment and of short-term memory span was only a coincidence, because only the first limit, not the second, can be characterized in information-theoretic terms (i.e., as a roughly constant number of bits). Therefore, there is nothing "magical" about the number seven, and Miller used the expression only rhetorically. Nevertheless, the idea of a "magical number 7" inspired much theorizing, rigorous and less rigorous, about the capacity limits of human cognition. The number seven constitutes a useful heuristic, reminding us that lists that are much longer than that become significantly harder to remember and process simultaneously.

== The "magical number 7" and working memory capacity ==
{{see also|Working memory#Capacity}}

Later research on [[short-term memory]] and [[working memory]] revealed that memory span is not a constant even when measured in a number of chunks. The number of chunks a human can recall immediately after presentation depends on the category of chunks used (e.g., span is around seven for digits, around six for letters, and around five for words), and even on features of the [[Chunking (psychology)|chunks]] within a category. Chunking is used by the brain’s short-term memory as a method for keeping groups of information accessible for easy recall.  It functions and works best as labels that one is already familiar with—the incorporation of new information into a label that is already well rehearsed into one’s long-term memory.  These chunks must store the information in such a way that they can be disassembled into the necessary data.&lt;ref name=Richard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shiffrin|first=Richard|author2=Robert Nosofsky |title=Seven plus or minus two: A commentary on capacity limitations.|journal=Psychological Review|date=April 1994|volume=101|series=2|issue=Centennial|pages=357–361|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.101.2.357|url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.catalog.georgefox.edu/ehost/detail?sid=851ab677-e748-469e-baa9-15bc54361042%40sessionmgr111&amp;vid=8&amp;hid=107&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=psyh&amp;AN=1994-28302-001|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The storage capacity is dependent on the information being stored. For instance, span is lower for long words than it is for short words. In general, memory span for verbal contents (digits, letters, words, etc.) strongly depends on the time it takes to speak the contents aloud. Some researchers have therefore proposed that the limited capacity of short-term memory for verbal material is not a "magic number" but rather a "magic spell".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=419–25 |doi=10.1037/0278-7393.12.3.419 |title=Short-term memory capacity: Magic number or magic spell? |year=1986 |last1=Schweickert |first1=Richard |last2=Boruff |first2=Brian |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=12 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Baddeley|Baddeley]] used this finding to postulate that one component of his model of [[working memory]], the [[phonological loop]], is capable of holding around 2 seconds of sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=556–9 |doi=10.1126/science.1736359 |title=Working memory |year=1992 |last1=Baddeley |first1=A |journal=Science |volume=255 |issue=5044 |pmid=1736359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=417–23 |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01538-2 |title=The episodic buffer: a new component of working memory? |year=2000 |last1=Baddeley |first1=Alan |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=4 |issue=11 |pmid=11058819}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the limit of short-term memory cannot easily be characterized as a constant "magic spell" either, because memory span also depends on other factors besides speaking duration. For instance, span depends on the lexical status of the contents (i.e., whether the contents are words known to the person or not).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=527–36 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1995.tb02570.x |title=The role of long-term memory mechanisms in memory span |year=1995 |last1=Hulme |first1=Charles |last2=Roodenrys |first2=Steven |last3=Brown |first3=Gordon |last4=Mercer |first4=Robin |journal=British Journal of Psychology |volume=86 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other factors also affect a person's measured span, and therefore it is difficult to pin down the capacity of short-term or working memory to a number of chunks. Nonetheless, Cowan has proposed that working memory has a capacity of about four chunks in young adults (and less in children and older adults).&lt;ref name=pmid11515286&gt;{{cite journal |pages=87–114; discussion 114–85 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X01003922 |title=The magical number 4 in short-term memory: A reconsideration of mental storage capacity |year=2001 |last1=Cowan |first1=Nelson |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=24 |pmid=11515286 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarnow finds that in a classic experiment typically argued as supporting a 4 item buffer by Murdock, there is in fact no evidence for such and thus the "magical number", at least in the Murdock experiment, is 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11571-010-9108-y |title=There is no capacity limited buffer in the Murdock (1962) free recall data |year=2010 |last1=Tarnow |first1=Eugen |journal=Cognitive Neurodynamics |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=395–7 |pmc=2974097 |pmid=22132047}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murdock|first=Bennett B.|title=The serial position effect of free recall|journal=View Table of Contents and Online First Publication Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=1962|volume=64|issue=5|pages=482–8|doi=10.1037/h0045106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other prominent theories of short-term memory capacity argue against measuring capacity in terms of a fixed number of elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bays | first1 = P.

== Other cognitive numeric limits ==

Cowan also noted a number of other limits of cognition that point to a "magical number four",&lt;ref name=pmid11515286/&gt; and different from Miller, he argued that this correspondence is no coincidence. One other process that seems to be limited at about four elements is [[subitizing]], the rapid enumeration of small numbers of objects. When a number of objects are flashed briefly, their number can be determined very quickly, at a glance, when the number does not exceed the subitizing limit, which is about four objects. Larger numbers of objects must be counted, which is a slower process. The film ''[[Rain Man]]'' portrayed an [[autistic savant]], who was able to rapidly determine the number of toothpicks from an entire box spilled on the floor, apparently subitizing a much larger number than four objects. A similar feat was informally observed by [[neuropsychology|neuropsychologist]] [[Oliver Sacks]] and reported in his book ''[[The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat]]''. Therefore, one might suppose that this limit is an arbitrary limit imposed by our [[cognition]] rather than necessarily being a physical limit. (On the other hand, autism expert [[Daniel Tammet]] has suggested that the children Sacks observed may have pre-counted the matches in the box.&lt;ref name=Wilson2009&gt;{{cite news |last = Wilson |first=Peter |title=A savvy savant finds his voice |url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/a-savvy-savant-finds-his-voice/story-e6frg6to-1111118714550?nk=781e9e780fc341cb063ad51ada701fbe |date=31 January 2009 |work=www.theaustralian.news.com.au |publisher= [[The Australian]] |accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) There is also evidence that even four chunks is a high estimate: Gobet and Clarkson conducted an experiment and found that over half of the memory recall conditions yielded only about two chunks.  Research also shows that the size, rather than the number, of chunks that are stored in short-term memory is what allows for enhanced memory in individuals.&lt;ref name=Fernand&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gobet|first=Fernand|author2=Gary Clarkson |title=Chunks in memory: Evidence for the magical number four . . . or is it two?|journal=Memory|date=November 2004|volume=12|issue=6|pages=732–747|doi=10.1080/09658210344000530}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Original research inline|date=March 2009}}

'''''The Organism: A Holistic Approach to Biology Derived from Pathological Data in Man''''' is a book on [[psychology]] and [[neurology]] by Dr. [[Kurt Goldstein]], first published under the title '''''Der Aufbau des Organismus: Einführung in die Biologie unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der Erfahrungen am kranken Menschen''''', in 1934.

A new edition of the English translation was published in 1995: ''The Organism : A Holistic Approach to Biology Derived from Pathological Data in Man'', with a foreword by [[Oliver Sacks]], New York, Zone Books.
After the rise of Hitler, Goldstein escaped to Amsterdam, supported by The Rockefeller Foundation, where he dictated his work, which would become his magnum opus, in just six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Eling, Paul. "Neurognostics Answer." ''Journal of the History of the Neurosciences'' 21, no. 1 (2012): 119–125.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein described the work  being written while in a "time of enforced leisure" in the Netherlands during his flight from Nazi Germany, it was published with only minor revisions in English translation in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Frommer, Gabriel P., and Aaron Smith. "Kurt Goldstein and recovery of function." ''Brain Injury and Recovery'', pp. 71–88. Springer US, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldstein's work helped institute the field of [[phenomenological psychiatry]].&lt;ref&gt;Morley, James. "Phenomenological and biological psychiatry: Complementary or mutual?." ''Philosophy, Psychiatry, &amp; Psychology'' 9, no. 1 (2002): 87–90.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Organism'', Goldstein declared that human life cannot be compared to a system which simply returns to a state of balance after stimulation from outside.&lt;ref&gt;Noppeney, Uta. "Kurt Goldstein–A philosophical scientist." ''Journal of the History of the Neurosciences'' 10, no. 1 (2001): 67–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein, after critiquing different attempts to classify the instincts, writes that all instinctual manifestations emerge from "the drive to self-actualization."&lt;ref&gt;Malkemus, Samuel Arthur. "Reclaiming Instinct: Exploring the Phylogenetic Unfolding of Animate Being." ''Journal of Humanistic Psychology'' (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; At any moment the organism has the fundamental tendency to actualize all its capacities, its whole potential, as it is present in exactly that moment, and in exactly that situation in contact with the world under the given circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, M.: (1971): Selected Papers/Ausgewählte Schriften, The Hague (Nijhoff), p. 471&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the term "self-actualization" was originally introduced by Kurt Goldstein as a biological concept to indicate the tendency of the organism's innate motivation to actualize as much as possible which was subsequently extended.&lt;ref&gt;Teja, B. Bhargava, and B. R. Ambedkar. "MASLOW’S SELF-ACTUALIZATION AND ITS CONFLICTING THEORY TENDING TOWARDS INDIAN ETHOS." ''Economics'' 1, no. 3: 156–163.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein also referred to the same drive as an "actualizing tendency" and a "formative tendency."&lt;ref&gt;O’Hara, Maureen. "PCA Encounter Groups: Transformative Learning for Individuals and Communities." ''Interdisciplinary Applications of the Person-Centered Approach'', pp. 221–228. Springer New York, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Organism'' Goldstein's main concern was to apply the figure-ground principle of [[gestalt psychology]] from perception to the whole organism, presuming that the whole organism serves as the ground for the individual stimulus forming the figure - thus formulating an early criticism of the simple behavioristic stimulus-response-theory.&lt;ref&gt;''Der Aufbau des Organismus. Einführung in die Biologie unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der Erfahrungen am kranken Menschen.'' Nijhoff, Den Haag 1934, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldstein pointed out the experience of individuals with lesioned brains makes it obvious that our neurological and neuropsychological functioning is socially intertwined with that of other brains.&lt;ref&gt;Medved, M., and Jens Brockmeier. "Weird stories." ''Beyond Narrative Coherence'' (2010): 17–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein described preferred behavior (in contrast to non-preferred behavior) as the realization of a reduced subset of all possible performances available to oneself (whether in motility, perception, posture, etc.) that are characterized by a feeling of comfort and correctness.&lt;ref&gt;Di Paolo, Ezequiel A., and Hiroyuki Iizuka. "How (not) to model autonomous behaviour." ''BioSystems'' 91, no. 2 (2008): 409–423.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iizuka, Hiroyuki, and Ezequiel A. Di Paolo. "Toward Spinozist robotics: Exploring the minimal dynamics of behavioral preference." Adaptive Behavior 15, no. 4 (2007): 359–376.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work, Goldstein claimed that specific colors elicit specific emotional responses. Subsequently, clinicians have asserted that children's use of color in art, for example, is a manifestation of their underlying emotional status.&lt;ref&gt;Boyatzis, Chris J., and Reenu Varghese. "Children's emotional associations with colors." The Journal of Genetic Psychology 155, no. 1 (1994): 77–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his foreword to the English edition, 1995, Oliver Sacks writes (p.&amp;nbsp;9):

"But from the start, the physician in him found the classical methods — delineating a number of isolated "deficits" — inadequate. Whatever particular deficits there might he, he felt, there was always a general reaction or change in the individual as well, sometimes farther-reaching than the deficit itself. There grew on him the sense of the patient reacting as a whole, as an organism, developing altered orientations and behaviors in response to injury or illness. This sense came to a crisis during World War I, when he was confronted with the task of treating a great number of young soldiers with brain injuries. The very complex pictures he was to see in these patients led him to formulate an ever more elaborate corpus of theoretical concepts: abstract versus concrete behavior, "catastrophic" reactions to brain injury, and so on."

Sacks goes on (p. 11):

"The notion of order is central to Goldstein's ideas of health and disease and those of rehabilitation: "Thus, being well means to be capable of ordered behavior which may prevail in spite of the impossibility of certain performances which were formerly possible. But the new state of health is not the same as the old one … Recovery is a newly achieved state of ordered functioning ... .a new individual norm." Thus, in contradiction to a classical, "splitting" neurology, Goldstein sees symptoms not as isolated expressions of local damage in the nervous system but as "attempted solutions" the organism has arrived at, once it has been altered by disease. "Symptoms," for Goldstein, betoken whole levels of organization, adaptation to an altered inner state (and world). It is impossible, he emphasizes, to consider any illness — but above all, a neurological illness — without reference to the patient's self, and the forms of his adaptation and orientation within it. Disease, for Goldstein, involves a "shrinkage" (or, at the least, a "revision") of self and world, until an equilibrium of a radically new sort can be achieved."

      <comment>I only changed the way the vector \mathbf{r} was written in terms of the unit radial vector. That is, I only made the text clearer, following the standard convention. Before, it was written (r,0,0) leading to a possible misunderstanding, since it leads someone to think about cartesian components of a vector.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12924">In [[mathematics]], '''vector spherical harmonics (VSH)''' are an extension of the scalar [[spherical harmonics]] for use with [[vector field]]s. The components of the VSH are [[complex-valued]] functions expressed in the [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinate basis vectors]].

==Definition==
Several conventions have been used to define the VSH.&lt;ref&gt;
R.G. Barrera, G.A. Estévez and J. Giraldo, ''Vector spherical harmonics and their application to magnetostatics'', Eur. J. Phys. '''6''' 287-294 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Carrascal, G.A. Estevez, P. Lee and V. Lorenzo '' Vector spherical harmonics and their application to classical electrodynamics'', Eur. J. Phys., '''12''', 184-191 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
E. L. Hill, ''The theory of Vector Spherical Harmonics'', Am. J. Phys. '''22''', 211-214 (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
E. J. Weinberg, ''Monopole vector spherical harmonics'', Phys. Rev. D. '''49''', 1086-1092 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.M. Morse and H. Feshbach, ''Methods of Theoretical Physics, Part II'', New York: McGraw-Hill, 1898-1901 (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; 
We follow that of Barrera ''et al.''. Given a scalar [[spherical harmonic]] {{math|''Y&lt;sub&gt;ℓm&lt;/sub&gt;''(''θ'', ''φ'')}}, we define three VSH:

* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{lm} = Y_{lm}\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm} = r\nabla Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm} = \mathbf{r}\times\nabla Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; being the [[unit vector]] along the radial direction in [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; the vector along the radial direction with the same norm as the radius, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = r\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;. The radial factors are included to guarantee that the dimensions of the VSH are the same as those of the ordinary spherical harmonics and that the VSH do not depend on the radial spherical coordinate.

The interest of these new vector fields is to separate the radial dependence from the angular one when using spherical coordinates, so that a vector field admits a [[multipole expansion]]

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}=\sum_{l=0}^\infty\sum_{m=-l}^l\left(E^r_{lm}(r)\mathbf{Y}_{lm}+E^{(1)}_{lm}(r)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}+E^{(2)}_{lm}(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The labels on the components reflect that &lt;math&gt;E^r_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; is the radial component of the vector field, while &lt;math&gt;E^{(1)}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^{(2)}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; are transverse components (w.r.to the radius vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;).

==Main Properties==

===Symmetry===
Like the scalar spherical harmonics, the VSH satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{l,-m} = (-1)^m \mathbf{Y}^*_{lm}\qquad\mathbf{\Psi}_{l,-m} = (-1)^m \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{lm}\qquad\mathbf{\Phi}_{l,-m} = (-1)^m \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

which cuts the number of independent functions roughly in half. The star * indicates [[complex conjugate]].

===Orthogonality===

The VSH are [[orthogonal functions|orthogonal]] in the usual three-dimensional way at a point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}=0\qquad\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}=0\qquad\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}=0&lt;/math&gt;

They are also orthogonal in the Hilbert space

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{Y}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = \delta_{ll'}\delta_{mm'}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = l(l+1)\delta_{ll'}\delta_{mm'}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = l(l+1)\delta_{ll'}\delta_{mm'}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

An additional result at a single point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; (not reported in Barrera et al, 1985) is (for all &lt;math&gt;l,m,l',m'&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Psi}_{l'm'}=0\qquad\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Phi}_{l'm'}=0&lt;/math&gt;

===Vector multipole moments===
The orthogonality relations allow one to compute the spherical multipole moments of a vector field as

:&lt;math&gt;E^r_{lm} = \int \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{Y}^*_{lm}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E^{(1)}_{lm} = \frac{1}{l(l+1)}\int \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{lm}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E^{(2)}_{lm} = \frac{1}{l(l+1)}\int \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{lm}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

===The gradient of a scalar field===
Given the [[multipole expansion]] of a scalar field

: &lt;math&gt;\phi = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l \phi_{lm}(r) Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

we can express its gradient in terms of the VSH as

: &lt;math&gt;\nabla\phi = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi_{lm}}{\mathrm{d}r} \mathbf{Y}_{lm}+
\frac{\phi_{lm}}{r}\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Divergence===
For any multipole field we have

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\left(f(r)\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\right) = \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{2}{r}f\right)Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\left(f(r)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\right) = -\frac{l(l+1)}{r}fY_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\left(f(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

By superposition we obtain the [[divergence]] of any vector field

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}E^r_{lm}}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{2}{r}E^r_{lm}-\frac{l(l+1)}{r}E^{(1)}_{lm}\right)Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

we see that the component on {{math|'''Φ'''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓm''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is always [[solenoidal]].

===Curl===
For any multipole field we have

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\left(f(r)\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\right) =-\frac{1}{r}f\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\left(f(r)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\right) = \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{1}{r}f\right)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\left(f(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\right) = -\frac{l(l+1)}{r}f\mathbf{Y}_{lm}-\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{1}{r}f\right)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

By superposition we obtain the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of any vector field

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\mathbf{E} = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l
\left(-\frac{l(l+1)}{r}E^{(2)}_{lm}\mathbf{Y}_{lm}-\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}E^{(2)}_{lm}}{\mathrm{d}r}+
\frac{1}{r}E^{(2)}_{lm}\right)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}+
\left(-\frac{1}{r}E^r_{lm}+\frac{\mathrm{d}E^{(1)}_{lm}}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{1}{r}E^{(1)}_{lm}\right)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Laplacian===
Action of the [[Laplace operator]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta = \nabla\cdot\nabla&lt;/math&gt; separates as follows

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\left(f(r)\mathbf{Z}_{lm}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} r^2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right)\mathbf{Z}_{lm}
+ f(r)\Delta \mathbf{Z}_{lm},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_{lm} = \mathbf{Y}_{lm}, \mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}, \mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{Y}_{lm} = -\frac{1}{r^2}(2+l(l+1))\mathbf{Y}_{lm} +\frac{2}{r^2}\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm} = \frac{2}{r^2}l(l+1)\mathbf{Y}_{lm} -\frac{1}{r^2}l(l+1)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm} = -\frac{1}{r^2}l(l+1)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also note that this action becomes [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]], i.e. the off-diagonal coefficients are equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{r^2}\sqrt{l(l+1)}&lt;/math&gt;, for the properly [[Unit vector|normalized]] VSH.

==Examples==

===First vector spherical harmonics===

:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}_{21}= \sqrt{\frac{15}{8\pi}}\,e^{i\varphi}\,\left(\mathrm{i}\cos\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}-\cos 2\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{\varphi}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}_{22}= \sqrt{\frac{15}{8\pi}}\,\sin\theta\,e^{2i\varphi}\,\left(-\mathrm{i}\,\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}+\cos\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{\varphi}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The expression for negative values of m are obtained applying the symmetry relations.

==Applications==

===Electrodynamics===
The VSH are especially useful in the study of [[Electromagnetic wave equation#Multipole expansion|multipole radiation fields]]. For instance, a magnetic multipole is due to an oscillating current with angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and complex amplitude

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{J}}= J(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

and the corresponding electric and magnetic fields can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{E}}= E(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{B}}= B^r(r)\mathbf{Y}_{lm}+B^{(1)}(r)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into Maxwell equations, Gauss' law is automatically satisfied

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\hat{\mathbf{E}}=0&lt;/math&gt;

while Faraday's law decouples in

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\hat{\mathbf{E}}=-\mathrm{i}\omega\hat{\mathbf{B}}\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad
\left\{\begin{array}{l}\displaystyle \frac{l(l+1)}{r}E = \mathrm{i}\omega B^r \\ \ \\ 
\displaystyle\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}r} +\frac{E}{r}= \mathrm{i}\omega B^{(1)}\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

Gauss' law for the magnetic field implies

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\hat{\mathbf{B}} = 0\quad\Rightarrow \quad\frac{\mathrm{d}B^r}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{2}{r}B^r - \frac{l(l+1)}{r}B^{(1)}=0&lt;/math&gt;

and Ampère-Maxwell's equation gives

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\hat{\mathbf{B}} = \mu_0 \hat{\mathbf{J}} + \mathrm{i}\mu_0\varepsilon_0\omega \hat{\mathbf{E}} \quad\Rightarrow\quad -\frac{B^r}{r}+\frac{\mathrm{d}B^{(1)}}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{B^{(1)}}{r} = \mu_0J+\mathrm{i}\omega\mu_0\varepsilon_0E&lt;/math&gt;

In this way, the partial differential equations have been transformed into a set of ordinary differential equations.

===Fluid dynamics===

In the calculation of the [[Stokes' law]] for the drag that a viscous fluid exerts on a small spherical particle, the velocity distribution obeys [[Navier-Stokes equations]] neglecting inertia, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot \mathbf{v} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{0} = -\nabla p + \eta \nabla^2\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

with the boundary conditions

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}\quad (r=a)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = -\mathbf{U}_0\quad (r\to\infty)&lt;/math&gt;

being '''U''' the relative velocity of the particle to the fluid far from the particle. In spherical coordinates this velocity at infinity can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}_0 = U_0\left(\cos\theta\, \hat{\mathbf{r}} - \sin\theta \,\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\right) = U_0 \left(\mathbf{Y}_{10} + \mathbf{\Psi}_{10}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

The last expression suggest an expansion on spherical harmonics for the liquid velocity and the pressure

:&lt;math&gt;p=p(r)Y_{10}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = v^r(r) \mathbf{Y}_{10} + v^{(1)}(r) \mathbf{\Psi}_{10}&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution in the Navier-Stokes equations produces a set of ordinary differential equations for the coefficients.

'''Visual culture''' is the aspect of [[culture]] expressed in [[image|visual images]]. Many academic fields study this subject, including [[cultural studies]], [[art history]], [[critical theory]], [[philosophy]], [[media studies]], and [[anthropology]].

== Overview ==
Among theorists working within contemporary culture, this field of study often overlaps with [[film theory|film studies]], [[psychoanalytic theory]], [[sex studies]], [[queer theory]], and the [[television studies|study of television]]; it can also include [[video game studies]], [[comics]], [[visual arts|traditional artistic media]], [[advertising]], the [[Internet]], and any other medium that has a crucial [[visual]] component.

The field's versatility stems from the range of objects contained under the term "visual culture", which aggregates "visual events in which information, meaning or pleasure is sought by the consumer in an interface with visual technology".  The term "visual technology" refers any media designed for purposes of perception or with the potential to augment our visual capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mirzoeff|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas Mirzoeff|title=What is Visual Culture?|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Mirzoeff-What_is_Visual_Culture.pdf|work= The Visual Culture Reader (2nd ed.)|isbn=978-0-415-14134-5 |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the changing technological aspects of visual culture as well as a scientific method-derived desire to create taxonomies or articulate what the "visual" is, many aspects of Visual Culture overlap with the study of science and technology, including hybrid electronic media, cognitive science, neurology, and image and brain theory.  In an interview with the ''[[Journal of Visual Culture]]'', academic [[Martin Jay]] explicates the rise of this tie between the visual and the technological: "Insofar as we live in a culture whose technological advances abet the production and dissemination of such images at a hitherto unimagined level, it is necessary to focus on how they work and what they do, rather than move past them too quickly to the ideas they represent or the reality they purport to depict. In so doing, we necessarily have to ask questions about ... technological mediations and extensions of visual experience."&lt;ref name="That Visual Turn"&gt;{{cite web|title=That Visual Turn|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/Jay-VisualTurn-JVC-2002.pdf|work=[[Journal of Visual Culture]]|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visualism==
The term "Visualism" was developed by the German anthropologist [[Johannes Fabian]] to criticise the dominating role of vision in scientific discourse, through such terms as [[observation]]. He points to an under theorised approach to the use of visual representation which leads to a corpuscular theory of knowledge and information which leads to their atomisation.&lt;ref name=Rarey&gt;{{cite book |last=Rarey |first=Matthew |editor1-first=James |editor1-last=Elkins |editor2-first=Kristi |editor2-last=McGuire |editor3-first=Maureen |editor3-last=Burns |editor4-first=Alicia |editor4-last=Chester |editor5-first=Joel  |editor5-last=Kuennen |title=Theorizing Visual Studies: Writing Through the Discipline |publisher=Routledge |date=2012 |pages= 278–281|chapter=Visualism |isbn=9781136159169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with other areas of study==
It also may overlap with another emerging field, that of [[performance studies]].  As "the turn from art history to visual culture studies parallels a turn from theater studies to performance studies", it is clear that the perspectival shift that both emerging fields embody is comparable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Shannon|title=Performing Show and Tell: Disciplines of Visual Culture and Performance Studies|url=http://vcu.sagepub.com/content/4/2/163.abstract|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Visual Culture" goes by a variety of names at different institutions, including Visual and Critical Studies, Visual and Cultural Studies, and Visual Studies.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}
There has appeared analysis which applies method with computational media. For example, in 2008, [[Yukihiko Yoshida]] did a study called&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida,Yukihiko, Leni Riefenstahl and German Expressionism: A Study of Visual Cultural Studies Using Transdisciplinary Semantic Space of Specialized Dictionaries ,Technoetic Arts: a journal of speculative research (Editor Roy Ascott),Volume 8, Issue3,intellect,2008&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Leni Riefenstahl]] and [[German expressionism]]: research in Visual Cultural Studies using the trans-disciplinary semantic spaces of specialized dictionaries."  The study took databases of images tagged with connotative and denotative keywords (a search engine) and found Riefenstahl's imagery had the same qualities as imagery tagged "degenerate" in the title of [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]], Germany at 1937.

== History ==
Early work on visual culture has been done by [[John Berger]] (''[[Ways of Seeing]]'', 1972) and [[Laura Mulvey]] (''[[Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]'', 1975) that follows on from [[Jacques Lacan]]'s theorization of the unconscious [[gaze]]. Twentieth-century pioneers such as [[György Kepes]] and [[William Ivins, Jr.]] as well as iconic phenomenologists like [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] also played important roles in creating a foundation for the discipline. For the history of art, [[Svetlana Alpers]] published a pioneering study on ''The Art of Describing: Dutch Art in the Seventeenth Century'' (Chicago 1983) in which she took up an earlier implus of [[Michael Baxandall]] to study the visual culture of a whole region of early-modern Europe in all its facets: landscape painting and perception, optics and perspectival studies, geography and topographic measurements, united in a common ''mapping impulse''.

Major works on visual culture include those by [[W. J. T. Mitchell]], [[Griselda Pollock]], [http://www.ves.fas.harvard.edu/bruno.html Giuliana Bruno], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Paul Crowther (philosopher)|Paul Crowther]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]]. Continuing work has been done by [[Lisa Cartwright]], [[Margaret Dikovitskaya]], [[Nicholas Mirzoeff]], and [[Jackie Stacey]]. The first book titled Visual Culture (Vizuális Kultúra) was written by [[:hu:Miklós Pál|Pál Miklós]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="Vizuális Kultúra"&gt;{{cite book |last=Miklós |first=Pál |title=Vizuális Kultúra: Elméleti és kritikai tanulmányok a képzőművészet köréből |publisher=Magvető |date=1976 |isbn=9632702980}}&lt;/ref&gt; For history of science and technology, [[Klaus Hentschel]] has published a systematic comparative history in which various patterns of their emergence, stabilization and diffusion are identified.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Klaus Hentschel]]: [http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198717874.do ''Visual Cultures in Science and Technology - A Comparative History''], Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the German-speaking world, analogous discussions about "Bildwissenschaft" (image studies) are conducted, a.o., by Gottfried Boehm, [[Hans Belting]], and Horst Bredekamp.

Visual culture studies have been increasingly important in religious studies through the work of [[David Morgan (Art Historian)|David Morgan]], Sally Promey, [[Jeffrey F. Hamburger]], and S. Brent Plate.

==Difference from image studies==

While the image remains a focal point in visual culture studies, it is the relations between images and consumers that are evaluated for their cultural significance, not just the image in and of itself.  [[Martin Jay]] clarifies, "Although images of all kinds have long served as illustrations of arguments made discursively, the growth of visual culture as a field has allowed them to be examined more in their own terms as complex figural artifacts or the stimulants to visual experiences."&lt;ref name="That Visual Turn"/&gt;

Likewise, [[W. J. T. Mitchell]] explicitly distinguishes the two fields in his claim that visual culture studies "helps us to see that even something as broad as the image does not exhaust the field of visuality; that visual studies is not the same thing as image studies, and that the study of the visual image is just one component of the larger field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visual Culture/Visual Studies: Inventory of Recent Definitions|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/visualarts/VisualCulture/VisualCultureStudies-definitions.html|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Theosophist01.jpg|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Cover of a magazine ''[[The Theosophist]],'' Bombay.&lt;/center&gt;]]
"'''What Are The Theosophists?'''" is an editorial published in October 1879 in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] magazine ''[[The Theosophist]].'' It was compiled by [[Helena Blavatsky]]{{refn|group=note|''The Theosophist,'' Vol. 1, No. 1, October, 1879, pp. 5–7.{{sfn|Index}}}} and it was included the 2nd volume of the ''Blavatsky Collected Writings.''{{sfn|Blavatsky|1967}}

== Analysis of contents ==
=== Accusations and accusers ===
Arnold Kalnitsky wrote in his thesis{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003a}} that in this article "we find a rather expansive statement of... [Blavatsky's] thoughts at that moment about the status of the movement, the [[Theosophical Society]], its objectives, and the issues it was confronting." He wrote that the article begins with a question whether the Theosophists "are they what they claim to be": researchers of the laws of nature, ancient and modern [[philosophy]], and [[science]].{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=65}} Blavatsky asks: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Are they [[Deism|Deists]], [[Atheism|Atheists]], [[Scientific socialism|Socialists]], [[Materialism|Materialists]], or [[Idealism|Idealists]]; or are they but a schism of modern [[Spiritualism]],—mere visionaries?"{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=5|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=65}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thesis author has written that author of the article lists some of the allegations brought against the Theosophical movement, and calls several accusers of the Theosophists. This is the "miracle-working;" and a work as "spies of an autocratic Czar;" and propaganda of socialist and nihilistic doctrines; and collusion "with the French Jesuits" to discredit modern Spiritualism for money. The American [[Positivism|Positivists]] call the Theosophists with dreamers, the New York journalists call them [[Fetishism|fetishists]], the Spiritualists say they are revivers of superstitions, the servants of the Christian Church call them unbelieving messengers of Satan, professor [[William Benjamin Carpenter|Carpenter]] argues that they are silly and gullible persons, and some of their Hindu opponents have accused them "with the employment of ''demons'' to perform certain [[Paranormal|phenomena]]."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=5|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=65}} Kalnitsky has quoted her assessment of all this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"One fact stands conspicuous—the [[Theosophical Society|Society]], its members, and their views, are deemed of enough importance to be discussed and denounced: ''Men slander only those whom they hate—or fear''."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=5|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=66}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Support of friends ===
[[File:Helena Blavatsky in India.jpg|thumb|left|180px|&lt;center&gt;[[Tallapragada Subba Row]], Bawaji, and [[Helena Blavatsky|HPB]].{{refn|group=note|A Russian Indologist [[Alexander Senkevich]] stated: "Blavatsky suddenly found around herself people with ardent hearts, who were sufficiently educated, honest and unselfish. Their indifference to material benefits, the lack of claims to working conditions, and patriotic aspirations remarkably corresponded to hers demands for new activists of the Theosophical movement from the Indians."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=349}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
Kalnitsky wrote that Blavatsky, having characterized the opponents of the movement at first, then notes that Theosophy, to a certain extent, relies on "public support and respect." In his opinion, she tries to create the impression that there is an equal ratio between the supporters and opponents of Theosophists: "But, if the Society has had its enemies and traducers, it has also had its friends and advocates. For every word of censure, there has been a word of praise."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=5|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=66}}{{refn|group=note|Alexander Senkevich wrote, "Already in the first months of her stay in India, Blavatsky received an unusually warm greeting from [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]], editor of [[The Pioneer (newspaper)|''The Pioneer'']], an influential daily English newspaper, the mouthpiece of the British government in India."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=335}} According to [[Alvin Boyd Kuhn]], Sinnett is the "main authority for the events of the Indian period in Madame Blavatsky's life."{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=80}}}} Kalnitsky wrote to show the presence of a positive attitude towards the Theosophists, Blavatsky refers to the "exponential growth of membership" in the Theosophical Society and to the expansion of its geography. As examples of the recognition of Theosophy as a serious undertaking, she speaks of an alliance, albeit "short-lived", with the Indian Society of [[Arya Samaj]],{{refn|group=note|The leader of this Society [[Swami]] [[Dayananda Saraswati|Dayananda]] supported "the idea of [[Henry Olcott]] to establish branches of the Theosophical Society throughout India."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=344}}}} and of the fraternal connection with the Ceylon [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].{{refn|group=note|Olcott and Blavatsky, who received the US citizenship previously, were the first Americans who were converted in 1880 to [[Buddhism]] in the traditional sense.{{sfn|Prebish, Tanaka|1998|p=198}}}} Accordung to this thesis, partial acceptance of the Theosophical doctrine by [[Hindu]]s and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] organizations was an important factor in the propaganda of the movement demonstrated that it really is "something tangible and legitimate", which is embodying the beliefs represented in the eastern traditions of ancient India.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=66}}{{refn|group=note|Peter Washington wrote: "Perhaps Blavatsky knew that scandal is as good a way as any to make a mark on the public mind. It certainly seems to have worked in her case, in so far as the Theosophical Society prospered, despite the disillusionment of individuals such as [[A. O. Hume|Hume]]."{{sfn|Washington|1995|p=65}} Alexander Senkevich stated: "By the summer of 1879, many wealthy Indians had joined the Theosophical Society. For example, Shishir Babu, publisher and editor of the Calcutta newspaper ''Amrita Bazar Patrika'', as well as the rajah of the principality Bhavnagar."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=354}}}} Kalnitsky has quoted the article:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"None is older than she in esoteric wisdom and civilization, however fallen may be her poor shadow—modern India. Holding this country, as we do, for the fruitful hot-bed whence proceeded all subsequent philosophical systems, to this source of all psychology and philosophy a portion of our Society has come to learn its ancient wisdom and ask for the impartation of its weird secrets."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=5|Kalnitsky|2003|2pp=66–7}}{{refn|group=note|John Driscoll wrote: "India is the home of all theosophic speculation. Oltramere says that the directive idea of Hindu civilization is theosophic. Its development covers a great many ages, each represented in Indian religious literature. There are formed the basic principles of theosophy."{{sfn|Driscoll|1912|p=626}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Free researchers ===
{{See also|Theosophy and science#Theosophists-scientists}}
In his thesis Kalnitsky cited a passage where Blavatsky explains that the Theosophical Society is completely free from personal preferences and "sectarian" interests:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Having no accepted [[creed]], our Society is very ready to give and take, to learn and teach, by practical experimentation, as opposed to mere passive and credulous acceptance of enforced dogma. It is willing to accept every result claimed by any of the foregoing schools or systems that can be logically and experimentally demonstrated. Conversely, it can take nothing on mere faith, no matter by whom the demand may be made."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=6|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=69}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thesis author commented that this idealized position of Blavatsky should "lead the reader" to the conclusion that the Theosophical Society is an "equivalent" of a scientific research organization, where the main criterion is "logic and experimental verification", not dogma and blind faith. There is here no definite desire to uncompromisingly replace the purely intellectual and rationalist approach with an orientation only to something "[[spirit]]ual and [[paranormal]]". It is assumed that the [[Mysticism|mystical]] and [[occult]] positions of Theosophy can "ultimately be verified and confirmed" by methods acceptable to "the foregoing schools or systems". Kalnitsky noted that the article author seeks to destroy the authority of the "dogmatic, rationalistic and materialistic" worldviews. She believes that the "contents of knowledge" obtained through esoteric methods are "fully capable" of satisfying the empirical and logical "standards of verifiability." Author of the article reminds the reader that many members of the Society belong to different races and nationalities, have different education and faith, but interest in "magic, spiritualism, mesmerism, occultism" is the basis for bringing together people who are sympathetic to Theosophy.{{refn|group=note|A religious studies scholar Tim Rudbøg wrote that in this article Blavatsky "briefly mentioned the study of occult phenomena".{{sfn|Rudbøg|2012|p=127}}}}{{refn|group=note|Professor [[Robert Ellwood]] stated that the Theosophical Society is not a church or religious institution in the usual sense: "Many theosophists, including myself, are also members of a church or other religious organizations. Theosophists include [[Christians]], [[Hindus]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], and others."{{sfn|Ellwood|2014|p=205}}}} Thesis author wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, even some supporters of the theoretical materialism can be accepted as members of the Society if they are sufficiently objective to recognize that "spiritual principles" can actually abolish the "limited conceptions of orthodox science." Nevertheless, in the Society there can be no place for atheists or fanatical sectarians of any religion.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=69}} An Ukrainian philosopher Julia Shabanova{{sfn|Шабанова|2016|p=197}} wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, the genuine Theosophists should have faith in the intangible, omnipotent, omnipresent, and invisible Cause, which "is '''All''', and '''Nothing'''; ubiquitous yet one; the Essence filling, binding, bounding, containing everything; contained in all."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=6|Шабанова|2016|2p=25}}

Blavatsky believes that "the very fact of a man's joining it proves that he is in search of the final truth as to the ultimate essence of things" and that the very character of the idea of the Theosophical Society consists in the "free and fearless investigation."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=6|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=70}}{{refn|group=note|Professor Shabanova has quoted from the article the description of Theosophy, "Theosophy in its fruition is spiritual knowledge itself—the very essence of philosophical and theistic enquiry."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=5|Шабанова|2016|2p=25}}}} Kalnitsky and Shabanova have quoted the article as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It will, we think, be seen now, that whether classed as [[Theism|Theists]], [[Pantheism|Pantheists]] or Atheists, such men are near kinsmen to the rest. Be what he may, once that a student abandons the old and trodden highway of routine, and enters upon the solitary path of independent thought—Godward—he is a Theosophist; an original thinker, a seeker after the eternal truth with 'an inspiration of his own' to solve the universal problems."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=6|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=70|Шабанова|2016|3p=25}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The article author explains that charter of the Theosophical Society was written in the image and likeness of the [[Constitution of the United States of America]], the country where it was born. She writes that "the Society, modelled upon this Constitution, may fairly be termed a 'Republic of Conscience'."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=6|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=72|Rudbøg|2012|3p=440}}

Kalnitsky wrote that Blavatsky assigns to Theosophy a special supreme status, which does not depend on any misconduct committed by "individual members of the organization." She believes that the Theosophical Society is "potentially a more effective institution" than any scientific or religious organization. "Unlike sectarian religions," Theosophy is not obsessed with differences, because it is based on the "principle of universal brotherhood." Ultimately, the Theosophical ideals and goals surpass any "existing ideologies and social movements." Therefore, Theosophy stands for a voluntarily accepted and approved "spiritual orientation." Thus, according to the Theosophical view, universal brotherhood must become the "logical and inevitable result" of life. Kalnitsky noted that, according to the article author, all modern social positions are unsatisfactory and limited, based "on partial and incomplete" ideas and beliefs that do not have genuine "spiritual legitimacy."{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=73}} He quoted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Unconcerned about politics; hostile to the insane dreams of [[Socialism]] and of [[Communism]], which it abhors—as both are but disguised conspiracies of brutal force and sluggishness against honest labour; the Society cares but little about the outward human management of the material world. The whole of its aspirations are directed towards the occult truths of the visible and [[Plane (esotericism)|invisible worlds]]. Whether the physical man be under the rule of an empire or a republic, concerns only the man of matter. His body may be enslaved; as to his [[Soul]], he has the right to give to his rulers the proud answer of [[Socrates]] to his judges. They have no sway over the ''inner'' man."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=7|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=73}}{{refn|group=note|Also Tim Rudbøg wrote that, according to Blavatsky, "The Theosophical Society is not concerned with any political conviction, such as socialism or communism."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=7|Rudbøg|2012|2pp=122, 434–5}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Theoretically, Theosophy was allegedly apolitical, as Kalnitsky noted, and did not concern external human control in "the material world." This was the official course, "motivated by the ideal of spiritual priorities" that went beyond the worldly worries. Although in fact, the persons involved in the Theosophical movement often had different opinions on specific problems. For example, the English and the German Theosophists occupied completely "different positions on the  occult significance" of the events of the [[World War I|First World War]]. However, Blavatsky believed that the true Theosophist should be separated "from the mainstream" of social activity and related ambitions.{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=74}}{{refn|group=note|Tim Rudbøg stated, "Several Theosophists did however become greatly involved in politics."{{sfn|Rudbøg|2012|p=122}}}} Kalnitsky cited hers words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The true student has ever been a recluse, a man of silence and [[meditation]]. With the busy world his habits and tastes are so little in common that, while he is studying, his enemies and slanderers have undisturbed opportunities. But time cures all and lies are but ephemera. Truth alone is eternal."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=7|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=74}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Kalnitsky wrote Blavatsky believes that a true researcher is a recluse who does not pay attention to "his enemies and slanderers" who belonging to the busy world. Nevertheless, not all researchers need to be represented this way. She mentions the contribution of some members of the Society to science, in particular to "biology and psychology", and the fact that there must be a "diversity in opinion" in science. In an attempt to explain the contradictory public statements made by the Theosophists, "she notes that even great Theosophical thinkers" can sometimes make mistakes and make unsuccessful comments. Such misses "may tarnish their reputations," but this do not detract from their efforts. The desire to change the usual ways of thinking requires the collective action of those who are ready to challenge the current situation and promote a more attractive and "believable alternative system of truth."{{sfn|Kalnitsky|2003|p=74–5}} In conclusion, the article author writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The attainment of these objects, all agree, can best be secured by convincing the reason and warming the enthusiasm of the generation of fresh young minds, that are just ripening into maturity, and making ready to take the place of their prejudiced and conservative fathers."{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1879|1p=7|Kalnitsky|2003|2p=75}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Theosophists as criticism object ==
Peter Washington stated that ideas of the Theosophical Society had often attracted all sorts of neurotics, hysterics and even madmen:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"All organisations which depend on enthusiasm and opposition to conventional opinion suffer from this problem to some degree; Theosophy appears to have been especially prone to it. The permanent residents at Adyar during the 1880s and '90s were typical. A quarrelsome collection of minor English aristocrats, rich American widows, German professors, Indian mystics and hangerson of every description, they were all eager to have their say, especially during [[Henry Olcott|Olcott's]] prolonged absences, and all ready to quarrel with one another."{{sfn|Washington|1995|p=70}}{{refn|group=note|Alexander Senkevich wrote, "Blavatsky was constantly surrounded by all kinds of riff-raff."{{sfn|Сенкевич|2012|p=392}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
