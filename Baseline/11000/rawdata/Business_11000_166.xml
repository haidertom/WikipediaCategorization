'''APICS''' is the association for [[supply chain management]] and a not-for-profit international education organization, offering certification programs, training tools and networking opportunities to increase workplace performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edumaritime.net/illinois/apics-chicago|title=The Association for Operations Management (APICS) - CSCP &amp; CPIM Certification|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apics.org/|title=APICS website|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1957, 20 production control managers formed the American Production and Inventory Control Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apics.org/about/overview/history|title=APICS History|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[organization]] later became an international association known as APICS.

APICS merged with the [[Supply-Chain Council]] in 2014 and with American Society of Transportation and Logistics (AST&amp;L) in 2015. APICS offers several professional designations.

==CPIM==
The "APICS Certified in Production and Inventory Management" or "APICS CPIM" designation is a professional certification offered by APICS. The program was founded in 1973. Since its inception, more than 100,000 people have earned the APICS CPIM designation. APICS CPIM designees learn terminology, concepts, and strategies related to [[demand management]], [[procurement]] and supplier planning, material requirements planning, capacity requirements planning, [[sales and operations planning]], master scheduling, [[performance measurement]]s, supplier relationships, [[quality control]], and [[continuous improvement]].

==CSCP==
The APICS Certified Supply Chain Professional, or APICS CSCP, demonstrates professional knowledge and organizational skills for developing more streamlined operations. Since its launch in 2006, more than 24,000 professionals in 100 countries have earned the CSCP designation.

==CLTD==
The APICS Certified Logistics, Transportation and Distribution, or APICS CLTD, demonstrates in-depth knowledge of a range of supply chain logistics topics. More than 1,000 professionals have earned their CLTDs since the program launched in 2016.

'''Alfred Robert Bader''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born April 28, 1924, in [[Vienna, Austria]]) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] chemist, businessman, [[philanthropist]], and collector of [[fine art]]. He was considered by the ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' poll of 1998 to be one of the "Top 75 Distinguished Contributors to the Chemical Enterprise" during C&amp;EN's 75-year history.&lt;ref name=Top75&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slade|first1=Diana|last2=Rouhi|first2=Maureen|title=Contributors to the Chemical Enterprise: C&amp;EN's Top 75|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|date=January 12, 1998|volume=75th Anniversary Issue|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/hotarticles/cenear/980112/top.html|accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Alfred Bader was born on  April 28, 1924, in [[Vienna, Austria]].  His father, Alfred Bader, was of Czech Jewish descent.  His grandfather, Moritz Ritter von Bader, had been a civil engineer, who worked on the [[Suez Canal]] and was knighted by [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Josef]] for his service as Austrian consul at [[Ismaïlia]].&lt;ref name=Adventures/&gt;{{rp|10}} His mother, Elizabeth Countess Serényi, came from an aristocratic Catholic Hungarian family. In spite of adamant opposition from Serényi's family, the couple had married in London and settled in Vienna. Alfred was born only two weeks before his father's death. He was adopted by his father's sister, Gisela Reich, and raised as a Jew.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;{{rp|1–2}}&lt;ref name=Bader&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Bader, Drs. Alfred and Isabel|url=http://www.queensu.ca/encyclopedia/b/baderalfredisabel.html|title=Queen's Encyclopedia|date=2000|publisher=Queen's University|location=Kingston, Ontario|accessdate=July 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722062751/http://www.queensu.ca/encyclopedia/b/baderalfredisabel.html|archive-date=July 22, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His older sister, Marion, remained with Countess Serényi and was raised as a Catholic.&lt;ref name=Adventures/&gt;{{rp|11}}

In June 1938, Bader was forced out of school because Jews were forbidden to attend beyond the age 14.&lt;ref name=Adventures/&gt;{{rp|15}} On December 10, 1938, he was sent from [[Austria]] to [[England]] as part of the [[Kindertransport]] to escape [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] persecution.&lt;ref name="Jaywalker"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jaywalker.ca/Jaywalker_Magazine/Columns/Front_and_Centre/alfred_bader_about.htm | title=About Dr. Alfred Bader | publisher=Kingston, Ontario | accessdate=July 17, 2015 | website=jaywalker.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; His adoptive mother remained in Austria, and died in 1942 in [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]].&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

While in England, Bader attended the East Hove Senior School for Boys, and [[City College Brighton &amp; Hove|Brighton Technical College]].&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;{{rp|3–7}} In 1940 he was sent to a Canadian internment camp for European refugees (which Bader described as spartan but a good influence on his academic and social education). While in the camp, Bader passed his junior and senior matriculation, taking exams from McGill University.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;{{rp|7–10}} A Montreal sponsor, Martin Wolff, welcomed him into a Canadian Jewish family in late 1941 and encouraged him to study further.&lt;ref name=Bader/&gt;

==Education==
After being rejected by [[McGill University|McGill]], which had a Jewish "quota" and by the [[University of Toronto]], where the chemistry department was doing sensitive war work,&lt;ref name=Bader/&gt; Bader was accepted by [[Queen's University]], in Kingston, Ontario.  He received his B.Sc. in Engineering Chemistry in 1945, followed by a B.A. in History in 1946. During the summers, he worked for the Murphy Paint Company in Montreal, formulating paints, lacquers and varnishes to order.  He completed his M.S. in Chemistry in 1947, doing considerable work on the oxidation of [[linoleic acids]] and isomeric tetrahydroxystearic acids.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;{{rp|13–15}}  His work with Arthur F. McKay, a "superb experimentalist"&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;{{rp|13}}  who supervised Bader's laboratory work in experimental chemistry, convinced Bader to focus on the field of synthetic organic chemistry.&lt;ref name="OH"&gt;{{cite web|author=Center for Oral History| title=  Alfred R. Bader |url=https://oh.sciencehistory.org/oral-histories/bader-alfred-r|website= [[Science History Institute]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="transcript"&gt;{{cite book|first=Arnold |last=Thackray|title= Alfred R.

Bader went on to study at [[Harvard University]], with the support of the Abbott fellowship.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;{{rp|16}} He received an M.A. in Chemistry in 1949 and a Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry in 1950.&lt;ref name=ABCAC&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Bader Biography|url=http://www.alfred-bader.cz/biography.html|website=Alfred Bader, Chemist and Art Collector|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At Harvard, he studied with famed organic chemist [[Louis Fieser]], working on the rearrangement of [[quinone]]s and the development of intermediates in the [[Hooker reaction|Hooker oxidation process]].&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;{{rp|17–19}}

==Business==
While working for the Murphy Paint Company in Montreal, Bader was offered financial support to do graduate work, on the condition that he return to work at the company.  By the time he finished his Ph.D. at Harvard, Murphy Paint had been acquired by [[PPG Industries|Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co.]]  In January 1950, Bader began work as a research chemist at Pittsburgh Plate Glass. His appointment to the [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin research facilities  broke an [[Racial segregation|unwritten rule]] against the hiring of Jews and African Americans. While at PPG Bader did significant work in [[Transesterification|noncatalytic transesterification]] and in the development of [[monomers]], including systematic studies of alkenylphenols, unsaturated phenols, and [[phenolic resins]]. This work led to a number of patents. The patent for Bader's method of creating [[diphenolic acid]] was later sold by PPG to [[S. C. Johnson &amp; Son|Johnson Wax]] for $1M.  Bader remained with PPG until 1954, when the company planned a move to Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;{{rp|23–25}}

During this time, Bader became increasingly aware of the need for a small reliable company dedicated to providing quality research chemicals.  At that time [[Kodak]] was their only supplier, and the large company seemed to show insufficient consideration for small and independent researchers. Bader himself had experienced this as a graduate student, when he ordered one of the compounds he needed from the Kodak catalog.  He eventually had to make it himself due to its infrequent availability.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;{{rp|22}}

In 1951, while still working at PPG, Bader co-founded the Aldrich Chemical Company with Jack Eisendrath, a lawyer. Jack Eisendrath was the first company president.  Although Bader held the title of Chief Chemist, most chemicals were not produced in-house. Bader bought interesting compounds from a variety of sources in the United States and Europe and listed them in his catalog. The company initially operated out of a garage where the chemicals were stored and packaged for mailing. The first product sent out by Aldrich was [[Methylnitronitrosoguanidine]], which Bader had learned to produce at Queen's. By 1954 Bader and his first wife, Helen "Danny" Daniels, bought Eisendrath out of Aldrich,&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;{{rp|26–29}} becoming "sole and equal owners of the company."&lt;ref name=Firsan/&gt; Alfred Bader became the company president, leaving PPG.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;{{rp|26–29}}&lt;ref name=Firsan/&gt;

Reliable chemicals were essential for research chemists of all kinds. They saved time and work in preparation, and the availability of standardized key reagents and starting materials contributed to the [[reproducibility]] of experimental results. The Aldrich Chemical Company catalog eventually grew to contain nearly 50,000 substances, described by the Chemical Heritage Foundation as "a huge library of rare chemicals"&lt;ref name=CHFBio/&gt; in addition to thousands of those most commonly used. The company's "Big Red"&lt;ref name=CHFBio/&gt; annual catalog was often used as a reference work because of the extensive physical data and structural information that it contained.&lt;ref name=CHFBio&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Bader|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/visit/events/awards/affiliate-partnership-awards/pittcon-hof-bader.aspx|website=Chemical Heritage Foundation|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|accessdate=July 17, 2015|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712210726/http://www.chemheritage.org/visit/events/awards/affiliate-partnership-awards/pittcon-hof-bader.aspx|archivedate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the catalog grew, so did the company.  In 1962 in a 50:50 venture between Aldrich Chemicals and Metal Hydrides Inc., Alfred Bader founded [[Alfa Aesar|Alfa Inorganics]], intending to complement  Aldrich's organic chemicals with inorganic research chemicals. This joint venture was terminated in 1967. Other joint ventures have been formed as well.&lt;ref name=Firsan&gt;{{cite book|last=Firsan|first=Sharbil|title=Aldrichima Acta

ALFA Inorganics, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A separate corporation, the Alfred Bader Chemical Corp., was sold to Aldrich on December 20, 1965. A British subsidiary, originally known as Ralph N. Emanuel, Ltd., was co-owned by the Emanuel and Bader families from 1959 to 1969, was gradually taken over by Aldrich, and officially renamed Aldrich Chemical Co. Ltd. in 1973.  Aldrich also obtained a controlling interest in Heidenheimer Chemisches Laboratorium (HCL) in Heidenheim, Germany by 1971.&lt;ref name=Firsan/&gt;  In 1975 the Aldrich Chemical Company merged with Sigma Chemical Corporation to become the [[Sigma-Aldrich Corporation]]. Aldrich was a leading supplier of organic research chemicals; Sigma a leading supplier of research biochemicals.&lt;ref name=Firsan/&gt;  Together they became the 80th largest chemical company in the United States.&lt;ref name=Sakurai&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sakurai|first1=Kenji|title=News: Professional, 2009 Pittcon Heritage Award - A.

In an unexpected corporation upheaval Bader was voted off the board of the company in 1992, losing the title of chairman emeritus, but remaining one of the largest holders of the company's stock.&lt;ref name=Funding/&gt; Bader has since said that while it was a staggering blow at the time, the change has given him more time to deal in art works and continue his philanthropy, making him happier.&lt;ref name=Herschbach/&gt; The company later reinstated Bader in the role of ''chemist collector'', in which he provides the company journal ''Aldrichimica Acta'' with paintings for its covers.&lt;ref name=Herschbach&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herschbach|first1=Dudley|title=A Generous Chemist With A Keen Eye|journal=[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]|date=March 16, 2009|volume=87|issue=11|pages=58–61|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/87/i11/Generous-Chemist-Keen-Eye.html|accessdate=July 17, 2015|doi=10.1021/cen-v087n011.p058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bader stated, "I am an inveterate collector. It may be a sickness, and it began with stamps at eight, drawings at 10, paintings at 20, and rare chemicals at 30."&lt;ref name=Adventures/&gt;{{rp|96}} He collected stamps as a youth when his finances permitted. He purchased his first oil painting in the Canadian internment camp: his portrait, painted by a fellow inmate, for a fee of one Canadian dollar.&lt;ref name="transcript"/&gt;{{rp|38}}&lt;ref name=FineArts&gt;{{cite web|title=Alfred Bader Fine Arts, Established in 1961|url=http://www.alfredbader.com|website=Alfred Bader Fine Arts|accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lifelong collector, Bader has devoted himself to the study of art history and collection of many fine paintings.  In 1961, he and Marvin Klitsner established Alfred Bader Fine Arts gallery in Milwaukee.&lt;ref name=FineArts/&gt;  Beginning with its first issue in 1968, Bader contributed numerous articles on art subjects to the Aldrich Chemical Company's journal, ''[[Aldrichimica Acta]]''. In addition, full-color copies of Dutch masters from Bader's collection were used for the covers of many of the journal's issues.&lt;ref name=Herschbach/&gt;&lt;ref name=Acta&gt;{{cite web|title=Acta Volume I: 1968|url=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/ifb/acta/v01/acta-vol1-1968.html#1/z|website=Aldrichimica Acta|accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artworks from his collection were also featured on the Aldrich Handbook, beginning with the ''Quill Cutter'' by Paulus de Lesire in the 1967–68 edition of the catalog.&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Linda|title=Celebrating Alfred Bader At 90|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|date=April 28, 2014|volume=92|issue=17|pages=34–35|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i17/Celebrating-Alfred-Bader-90.html|accessdate=July 21, 2015|doi=10.1021/cen-09217-peoppromo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 Bader published his autobiography, ''Adventures of a Chemist Collector'', which details his experiences from Nazi-era refugee, to chemist magnate, to fine arts connoisseur. In 2008 he published his second autobiography, ''Chemistry &amp; Art - Further Adventures of a Chemist Collector''.

==Personal==
Bader's marriages are described in his autobiographical books. His romance in England with Isabel Overton (b. 1926), the daughter of a deeply religious Protestant family in Northern Ontario and a graduate of Victoria University in Toronto, began with a shipboard meeting in 1949 and continued in a rapid courtship and some 400 love letters.  Isabel broke off the relationship because of religious concerns and settled in [[Bexhill-on-Sea]] in [[Sussex, England]] but did not become romantically involved with anyone else.  Her love letters to Alfred Bader have been published as ''A Canadian in love'', 2000.&lt;ref name=Tale&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shales|first1=Brittany|title=The Baders: A tale of two hearts|url=http://blog.myams.org/2015/02/the-baders-a-tale-of-two-hearts/|website=AMS Blog|accessdate=July 17, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721040034/http://blog.myams.org/2015/02/the-baders-a-tale-of-two-hearts/|archivedate=July 21, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred went on to meet and marry his first wife Helen Ann Daniels "Danny", in the United States. Similar in many ways to Isabel, including a Protestant religious upbringing, Danny converted to Judaism before Bader proposed to her. Married in July 1952, they had two sons, David (born 1958) and Daniel (born 1961).  Danny worked at Aldrich Chemicals, and owned shares in the company.&lt;ref name=Adventures&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bader|first1=Alfred|title=Adventures of a chemist collector|date=1995|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|isbn=0-297-83461-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|65–69}}

Nearly three decades later Alfred re-connected with Isabel, which led to the breakdown of his marriage with Danny; Danny requested a divorce in 1981 and died six years later. Alfred subsequently married Isabel and the two remain happily married.&lt;ref name=Herschbach/&gt; Alfred and Danny's two sons, David and Daniel, now serve as half-owners of Alfred Bader Fine Arts. (Descendants of Bader's onetime partner in that gallery, Marvin Klitsner, now own the other half.)&lt;ref name=Herschbach/&gt;  They also serve as president and vice-president of Bader Philanthropies, a foundation originally formed in 1992, now honouring Helen Daniels Bader and Isabel and Alfred Bader.&lt;ref name="Bader Philanthropies"&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Path Forward|url=http://hbf.org/about-foundation|website=Bader Philanthropies|accessdate=July 17, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629145146/http://hbf.org/about-foundation|archivedate=June 29, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glauber&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glauber|first1=Bill|title=Bader  family extends commitment to charitable foundation|url=http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/bader-family-extends-commitment-to-charitable-foundation-b99431624z1-289687721.html|accessdate=July 21, 2015|work=Milwaukee Wisconsin Journal Sentinel|date=January 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports ownership==
===F.C. Nordsjælland===
Allan K. Pedersen started investing in FCN when the club was in financial difficulty, before buying further shares to gain ownership in the club with holding company AKP Holding with himself as director and his wife Bente Pedersen, as chairman.&lt;ref name=akp_his1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During his initial time as chairman of FCN, he would control many aspects of the club, including player purchases and sales, as well as scouting and talent development. Gradually delegating these responsibilities to then head coach [[Morten Wieghorst]] and sports director Jan Laursen.&lt;ref name=akp_power1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bold.dk/nyt/Wieghorst-faar-magten-i-FCN |title=Wieghorst får magten i FCN  |publisher=Bold.dk |language=Danish |date=19 April 2006  |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=akp_power2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bold.dk/nyt/Laursen-afloeser-Allan-K-Pedersen |title=Laursen afløser Allan K.

{{Update|section|date=September 2015}}
In October 2008, Allan K. Pedersen sold F.C. Nordsjælland from AKP Holding to himself for a reported 500,000 [[Danish kroner]], shortly before his holding company went bankrupt. A price Pedersen denies. Following an investigation from his creditors, it was found the sale was forced through without the bank's consent, and that the value for which the club was sold was too low, which ultimately reduced the finances the creators received for the sale. FCN was reevaluated to be worth 35 million kroner at the time of sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Horn |first=Jakob |url=http://www.bold.dk/nyt/Allan-K-Pedersen-solgte-FCN-til-sig-selv |title=Allan K.

'''Antonio Alegre''' (August 13, 1924 – February 24, 2010) was a notable Argentine football official. He was president of [[Boca Juniors]] from 1985 to 1995, and was widely credited with the football club's financial turnaround.&lt;ref name=grafico&gt;[http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/2010/02/25/C-2444-el-adios-a-antonio-alegre.php ''El Gráfico'': El adiós a Antonio Alegre] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Buenos Aires]] to [[Arab Argentine|Lebanese Argentine]] immigrants, he was affiliated to Boca Juniors since his youth. He worked as a [[construction]] laborer, and eventually became a prosperous businessman as the proprietor of the Alegre Pavement Company. Fond of [[ping pong]], his affable manner helped earn him the friendship of numerous important figures in Argentine politics,&lt;ref name=ale&gt;Ale, Ana. ''La Dinastía''. Editorial Planeta, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Radical Civic Union|UCR]] leader (and future President) [[Raúl Alfonsín]], [[Peronist]] lawmaker [[Antonio Cafiero]], and numerous members of the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|CGT]] trade union. Appointed director of the [[Buenos Aires Province]] bureau of the National Nutrional Plan by the newly elected President Alfonsín,&lt;ref name=ale/&gt; Alegre was encouraged to run for the post of President of Boca Juniors by influential friends, and in 1984 became a candidate to succeed Federico Pollack, whom Alfonsín had appointed federal [[receivership|receiver]].&lt;ref name=grafico/&gt;

Elected, and inaugurated on January 6, 1985, he took office in a moment of crisis. Accompanied by his friend and running mate, [[Credico-op Bank]] director [[Carlos Heller]], Alegre inherited a financially insolvent football club and a stadium unable to meet municipal safety requirements. The iconic [[Estadio Alberto J. Armando|La Bombonera]] stadium had been repeatedly closed for structural failures, and lawsuits against Boca Juniors were filed almost weekly.&lt;ref name=ole&gt;[http://www.ole.clarin.com/notas/2008/01/03/01576706.html Olé: Antonio Alegre] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Consequently, Boca, the winners of the [[Copa Intercontinental]] and the [[Copa Libertadores de América]] in 1977-78, had by 1984 been relegated to 16th place over the 19 [[Primera División Argentina|First Division]] teams at the time.&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;[http://otrosmovil.clarin.com/diario/2010/02/25/deportes/d-02147298.htm ''Clarín'' (25 Feb 2010)] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alegre settled 153 lawsuits early in his tenure by mortgaging his business assets for US$250,000, and by lending Boca Juniors US$800,000. These and other measures enabled him to recover the club's finances, and to refurbish the dilapidated La Bombonera stadium.&lt;ref name=ole/&gt; He also announced the sale of land acquired earlier by the team in the waterfront [[Puerto Madero]] district, a move opposed by Boca's former president, [[Alberto Armando]]. The land was promptly sold for US$21 million, however, and Armando's challenge to Alegre for the presidency of the team in 1986 was turned back.&lt;ref name=ale/&gt;
 
The club's improved finances led to its revival, and Boca emerged victorious in a number of coveted tournaments in subsequent years, including the 1989 [[Supercopa Sudamericana]], the 1990 [[Recopa Sudamericana]], the [[Apertura and Clausura in Argentine football|Campeonato de Apertura]] and [[Copa Master de Supercopa]] (1992), and the [[Copa de Oro|Copa de Oro Nicolás Leoz]] in 1993. The team invested increasingly large sums to acquire players who could strengthen the team, of whom few would remain, however; among his best investments was that of [[Carlos Fernando Navarro Montoya]], who would play for Boca in 396 games, and was instrumental in number of the team's titles in that era. Alegre also stepped up efforts to acquire players from lower divisions, and among these a number became important contributors. These included [[Diego Latorre]], Walter Pico, and [[Rodolfo Arruabarrena]].&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt; 

Alegre and Heller were defeated by [[Mauricio Macri]] on December 3, 1995, and the Alegre-Heller administration stepped down. The treasurer during their last term, [[Pedro Pompilio]], was elected president of the team following Macri's election as Mayor of Buenos Aires in 2007, and both the late Pedro Pompilio and his successor, [[Jorge Amor Ameal]], who was also part of the Alegre's management board, continued Alegre's policy of acquiring players from less prominent teams.&lt;ref name=ole/&gt;&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;

'''Belarus High Technologies Park''' (HTP) is a [[special economic zone]] with a special tax and legal regime in the [[Belarus]], contributing to the favorable and successful development of [[Information technology|IT]] business. It is a Belarusian analog of [[Silicon Valley]] in the US. Belarus HTP operates on the principle of [[extraterritoriality]]. The companies registered in it can enjoy all the advantages provided, regardless of the location of their Belarusian office.

== Description ==
The original HTP mission is to create favorable conditions for the development of the export-oriented programming industry in Belarus, the development of other export industries based on new and high technologies, as well as to concentrate human, scientific, production and financial capacities to enhance the competitiveness of the [[Economy of Belarus|national economy]].

The organization is headed by the Director of the HTP Administration. There are two Boards in the Park structure - the Expert Board&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.park.by/en/about/index2.html Expert Board members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325205337/http://www.park.by/en/about/index2.html|date=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Supervisory Board. The HTP Administration is subordinate to the President of the Republic of Belarus and reports to the Council of Ministers. It’s a legal entity at the national level and a nonprofit state institution. The HTP Administration’s activities involve creating conditions favorable for HTP residents, promoting domestic and foreign investments in information technologies and creating a modern infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-it-industry-in-belarus-2017-and-beyond/$FILE/ey-it-industry-in-belarus-2017-and-beyond.pdf|title=The IT industry in Belarus: 2017 and Beyond|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The High-Tech Park is the only organization in the country that has the right to provide tax benefits on a systematic basis. Resident companies enjoy important government support: they are exempted from most taxes, including [[value-added tax]] and income tax. Further, employees of the resident companies enjoy a 30% reduction in personal income tax compared with other sectors of the economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Highly qualified specialists enhance the competitiveness of Belarus HTP in overseas markets. They participate in IT projects of any complexity, starting from [[systems analysis]] and consulting and finishing with the design and development of complex systems.  Belarusian specialists are being trained in prestigious international educational centers, such as [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[SAP SE|SAP]], Lotus, Sun, [[Novell]]. Another advantage of Belarusian developers is that they also have deep knowledge in mathematics, physics and other sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.park.by/topic-benefits_htp_membership/?lng=en|title=Belarus Hi Tech Park  - Why HTP? - Benefits of HTP membership|website=www.park.by|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HTP is actively engaged in supporting IT education and innovative entrepreneurship. Today, HTP resident companies support about 80 joint laboratories in Belarusian technical universities. With the participation of HTP residents, the Educational Center of the Hi-Tech Park was established to provide re-education for adults who want to start a career in the IT industry, as well as training for employees of IT companies willing to improve their knowledge and skills. 1,629 people received training there in 2016, with 340 of them getting jobs in HTP companies. iTeen Academy for kids aged 6–15 years old also operates within the Educational Center.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2016, the HTP [[business incubator]] in [[Minsk]] hosted 55 events (conferences, workshops, contests, [[hackathon]]s, etc.) which attracted more than 9,000 participants (in 2015, there were 12 events and 2,000 participants). Here, startup companies rent offices at lower rates, receive advice on commercialization of their products and assistance in search for partners and investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.park.by/post-1380/|title=Парк высоких технологий - Новости и события - Парк высоких технологий подвел итоги работы в 2016 году|website=www.park.by|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2017, a new revolutionary draft Decree regulating HTP activities has been submitted to state bodies for consideration.&lt;ref name="BelarusFeed"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://belarusfeed.com/tech-decree-lukashenko/|title=9 Changes Of President Lukashenko's Decree That Will Turn Belarus Into IT-Heaven|date=2017-07-17|work=BelarusFeed|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Decree aims to create conditions that would facilitate the inflow of international investments, the opening of foreign representative offices and development centers. The Decree was initiated by the Director of the Belarus HTP Administration [[Vsevolod Yanchevsky]] who had been responsible for ensuring state policy in the spheres of information and high technologies since 2013. For the first time, prospects of the Decree were announced by him and Viktor Prokopenya during the visit of Belarus President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] to several IT companies in Minsk on March 13, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://belarusfeed.com/new-head-belarus-high-tech-park/|title=BREAKING: Lukashenko Appoints New Head Of Belarus High-Tech Park|date=2017-03-15|work=BelarusFeed|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://belarusfeed.com/tech-council-belarus/|title=IT Development Council Will Be Set Up In Belarus|date=2017-03-14|work=BelarusFeed|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In close cooperation with government authorities, a working group of the best specialists of the country worked on the project. It was led by the HTP Administration to ensure an effective interaction between lawmakers and people working in the IT industry. This Decree opens HTP doors for product companies, investment funds, as well as foreign companies that monetize IT products through advertising and paid [[Subscription business model|subscription]]. Furthermore, at the initiative of Vsevolod Yanchevsky, with the proposed bill the [[Digital currency|digital currencies]], as well as the mining associated with it, will be legalized and promoted. The bill will allow HTP residents to offer services of crypto exchanges, use [[Cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] and [[Crowdfunding|tokens]] and launch [[Initial coin offering|ICOs]] to raise funds. Belarus aims to pull [[Blockchain]] technology and cryptocurrency into the mainstream, not only in the Eastern European country but also internationally. This will allow for big mining centers to be formed which will be highly successful due to the excess and reasonable electricity that is available through the [[Nuclear power plant|nuclear power stations]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/belarus-stakes-on-blockchain-cryptocurrency-in-view-of-inviting-international-funds|title=Belarus Stakes On Blockchain, Cryptocurrency in View of Inviting International Funds|work=Cointelegraph|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this draft legislation tabled, the [[National Bank of the Republic of Belarus|National Bank]] has tested and approved the use of Blockchain technology in the banking sphere. The first practical use of this Blockchain network in the sector is the ability to transfer information about bank guarantees. The next step will be the introduction of the Blockchain technology in the [[securities market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thepaypers.com/cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-virtual-currencies/national-bank-of-belarus-builds-information-network-using-blockchain/769553-39|title=National Bank of Belarus builds information network using blockchain|website=www.thepaypers.com|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On top of that, the Decree introduces separate institutes of [[English law]] that will stimulate investment activities, sets legal basis for [[Autonomous car|driverless car technology]], lifts many restrictions regarding financial operations for IT companies, stimulates a breakthrough in IT education, as well as creates prerequisites for new jobs and revenue growth.&lt;ref name="BelarusFeed"/&gt;

According to a presidential decree passed in December 2017, the High Technologies Park will become a sandbox for blockchain startups offering tax exemptions and relying on elements of English law in commercial matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-22/europe-s-last-dictator-now-wants-to-be-its-blockchain-king|title=Europe’s Last Dictator Wants to Run a Global Crypto Hub|last=Kudrytski|first=Aliaksandr|date=22 December 2017|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Infrastructure  ==
The territory of the Park of High Technologies is located near the main [[thoroughfare]]s of the capital: the central avenue, the Minsk ring road, the road to the [[Minsk National Airport|National International Airport]] (distance to the airport is 40&amp;nbsp;km), and the [[Berlin]]-[[Minsk]]-[[Moscow]] railway line.

Despite the extraterritorial principle of registration of resident companies, according to the Decree No. 12, HTP occupies about 50 hectares of land for the construction of physical infrastructure. According to the general development plan, the High Technology Park should become the embodiment of the idea of a high-tech city whose inhabitants live, work and rest in comfortable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.park.by/post-565/|title=Парк высоких технологий - Новости и события - Валерий Цепкало: "Пусть 2013 год станет для всех нас годом новых свершений!"|website=www.park.by|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research and production zone will include a set of research and production buildings for HTP residents.

The residential area already consists of several multi floor buildings, as well as the kindergarten and primary school No. 31. In the business and educational zone there are a business center, offices of IT companies, a hostel for students of the IT Academy and a [http://www.ittime-hotel.by/ hotel]. The public sports zone includes multi-purpose sports halls, a swimming pool, a sauna, a fitness center, a health trail, a restaurant, a café and a health center. More HTP branches are going to be opened in the regional centers of the country.

== History ==

The initiative of creating a Belarusian analogue of the [[Silicon Valley]] originates from [[Valery Tsepkalo]] and [[Mikhail Myasnikovich]]. On September 22, 2005, the [[President of Belarus|President of the Republic of Belarus]] [[Alexander Lukashenko]] signed the Decree "On the High Technologies Park".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://park.by/post-376/|title=Парк высоких технологий - Новости и события - ПВТ 2005-2011 – как все начиналось|website=park.by|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, the Educational Center of HTP "IT Academy" was founded.

In September 2011, the construction of the first residential buildings began.

On January 12, 2012, India-Belarus Digital Learning Centre named after [[Rajiv Gandhi]] opened. Belarus Digital Learning Centre is dedicated to train IT-specialists and to upgrade qualifications of the professors of Belarusian technical universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.park.by/post-428/?lng=en|title=Belarus Hi Tech Park  - News&amp;Events - India-Belarus Digital Learning Centre in ICT Named After Rajiv Gandhi Opened|website=www.park.by|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2014, Alexander Lukashenko signed the Decree No. 4, which amended and supplemented the [http://law.by/document/?guid=3871&amp;p0=Pd0500012e Decree of September 22, 2005 No. 12 "On the Park of High Technologies"]. This decree expands the area of activities of HTP residents.

In May, 2015, HTP [[Business incubator|Business Incubator]] opened its doors to provide assistance to startup companies which develop their own products and build a special innovative environment in its co-working space designed for communication, learning, exchange of ideas and joint creativity.

In 2016, a joint educational project focused on teaching school students of grades 2-6 programming in [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]] was launched. The project was initiated by resident companies of Belarus Hi-Tech Park and supported by the HTP Administration and the [http://edu.gov.by/en/ Ministry of Education of the Republic of Belarus].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scratch.by/en/about/|title=General Information — Scratch|website=scratch.by|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2017 [[Vsevolod Yanchevsky]] was appointed director of the Belarus High-Tech Park Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://president.gov.by/en/news_en/view/vsevolod-yanchevsky-appointed-director-of-belarus-htp-administration-15795/|title=Events {{!}} The Official Internet Portal of the President of the Republic of Belarus|website=president.gov.by|language=en-EN|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, the position was occupied by [[Valery Tsepkalo]].

==Statistics==
Today, HTP is one of the leading innovative IT clusters in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. As of October 30, 2018, 388 resident companies with over 30.000 employees were registered in the HTP&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.park.by/post-1678/|title=Парк высоких технологий - Новости и события - В Парке высоких технологий зарегистрированы новые резиденты|publisher=www.park.by|accessdate=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The HTP resident headcount has been going up steadily over the last five years by approx. 3.000 a year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.park.by/post-1678/|title=Парк высоких технологий - Новости и события - В Парке высоких технологий зарегистрированы новые резиденты|website=www.park.by|access-date=2017-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Business Wars'''''|ビジネスウォーズ}}&lt;ref name="vgrebirth"/&gt; is a [[Interactive fiction|text adventure]] [[video game]] released for Japan's [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]].

==Gameplay==

===Summary===
A lot of strategy is used when players have to make [[Discernment|decisions]] and [[negotiation|negotiate]]. Messages always arrive using the [[data feed]] style to make the game more business-like. The [[game over|game can end]] with a loss if the wrong decision is made at the wrong time (similar to dying in an [[action game]]). The player will have to deal with [[loan shark]]s in the Caribbean, ruthless corporate executives from rival companies, [[arbitration]] sessions, and components that make the game look more like a [[strategy video game|strategy game]] at times. There are no items to use and very little action (with moving the guy around a virtual office building).

===Actions===
* みる (見る) Look
* かんがえる (考える) Think
* はなす (話す) Talk
* のむ (飲む) Drink
* でんわ (電話) Telephone
* たいさく (対策) Analyze
* いけん (意見) Opinion
* こうしょう (交渉) Negotiate
* いどう (移動) Move

'''CAMP''' (also spelled '''C.A.M.P.''', and called ''Camp'', standing for "Concezione Articoli Montagna Premana"; the English equivalents are "Conception" (N.B., evidently ''not'' "concession"), "Articles", "Mountains", "[[Premana]]"), is one of the world's leading manufacturers of equipment for [[climbing]] and associated activities such as [[ski mountaineering]] and industrial safety. The company is based in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=C.A.M.P ..... Italy: Who are on earth are they?|url=http://www.ukclimbing.com/articles/page.php?id=1358|publisher=UKClimbing|date=October 2008 |first=Ian |last=Smith |access-date=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAMP manufactures a wide range of products, including [[ice axe]]s, [[crampon]]s, [[ice screw]]s, [[piton]]s, [[carabiner]]s, [[nut (climbing)|nut]]s, [[tricam]]s, [[spring-loaded camming device|camming device]]s, [[climbing harness|harness]]es, [[helmet]]s, [[rucksack]]s, [[tent]]s, ski racing clothing, and various snow tools.

The company was founded by Nicola Codega, a [[blacksmith]], in 1889 in the Italian alpine village of [[Premana]], where it is still based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Info - C.A.M.P.|url=http://expo.planetmountain.com/en/companies/camp/info|work=Expo Planetmountain.com|publisher=Mountain Network s.r.l|access-date=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally producing [[wrought-iron]] goods, an order in 1920 for ice axes for the Italian army was their first foray into the world of climbing equipment. From there the company extended its climbing range to include crampons, pitons, and nuts, and eventually with the encouragement of leading mountaineer [[Riccardo Cassin]] and collaboration with American climber Greg Lowe (founder of [[Lowe Alpine]]), into non-metallic equipment. The company is still run by Codega's descendants.

'''CFM International''' is a [[joint venture]] between [[GE Aviation]], a division of [[General Electric]] of the [[United States]], and [[Safran Aircraft Engines]] (formerly known as [[Snecma]]), a division of [[Safran]] of [[France]]. The joint venture was formed to build and support the [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56]] series of [[turbofan]] engines.

The names of CFM International and the CFM56 product line are derived from the two parent companies' commercial engine designations: GE's [[General Electric CF6|CF6]] and Snecma's M56.

The joint venture has delivered 30,700 engines to more than 570 operators and has 13,700 engines in backlog.&lt;ref name=160711PR&gt;{{cite press release |url= https://www.cfmaeroengines.com/press-articles/2016-promises-another-strong-year-cfm/ |title= 2016 promises to be another strong year for CFM |publisher= CFM international common fan motor introduce to commercial fan motor|date= 11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 CFM delivered 1,665 CFM56 and 77 [[CFM International LEAP|LEAP]], and booked 2,677 orders : 876 CFM56 and 1,801 LEAP for US$36 billion at list price.

In 2017, CFM delivered 1,900 engines including 459 LEAPs, of which it plan to deliver 1,200 in 2018, 1,800 in 2019 and more than 2,000 in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/cfm-sets-new-engine-delivery-record-despite-leap-sho-445224/ |title= CFM sets new engine delivery record despite Leap shortfall |date= 25 January 2018 |author= Stephen Trimble |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The selection process==
An elaborate and formal process for deciding the ''Car of the Century'' was devised.  It started in October 1996, when a list of 700 cars was offered by the COTC organising committee as candidates for the award, which their experts had selected from recommendations made from within the car industry and from car clubs. &lt;ref&gt;http://autofestcityindia.hpage.co.in/car-of-the-century_96486083.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1997 a list of 200 eligible cars was announced at the [[AutoRAI]] [[motor show]] in [[Amsterdam]], having been selected from the 700 by an honorary committee of experts who were all independent and highly respected and experienced automotive experts.&lt;ref&gt;http://europe.autonews.com/article/19970217/ANE/702170815/car-of-the-century-search-begins&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step was for a jury of 133 professional automotive journalists &lt;ref&gt;http://www.motorcities.org/Year+of+the+Car/Model+T+Centennial-40.html&lt;/ref&gt; from 33 different countries, under the presidency of [[Lord Montagu of Beaulieu]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cwn.org.uk/motoring/rover/press-releases/9906/990624-car-of-the-century.htm&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce the list to 100, and the result was announced at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]] in September 1997. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.drivers.com/article/247/&lt;/ref&gt;

The elimination process proceeded with an Internet-based public vote &lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-11-04/business/9911040100_1_autos-poll-car-collector-top-cars&lt;/ref&gt; to select 10 cars, and for 25 cars to be selected by the jury of professionals.  In the event, 9 out of the 10 cars selected by the public were also amongst the 25 selected by the journalists (the [[AC Cobra]] being the extra car selected by the public), so 26 cars were announced at the [[Geneva Motor Show]] in March 1999, as the nominees for the next round.&lt;ref name="aapnews"&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-21456430.html "Car of the century voting narrows"], Tim Dornin, ''AAP General News'', March 15, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Carsten Anker 2.jpg|thumb|Statue of Carsten Anker, 1869]]
'''Carsten Tank Anker''' (17 November 1747 – 13 March 1824) was a Norwegian businessman, civil servant, politician and one of the Fathers of the Constitution of Norway. He was the owner of the manor house in [[Akershus]] at which the original National Assembly (''[[Riksforsamlingen]]'') of Norway was held. The manor house has since then been given the name ''[[Eidsvollsbygningen]]''.

==Early years==
Born in [[Halden|Frederikshald]], he was the son of the trader Erik Ancher (1709–1785) and cousin of [[Bernt Anker]]. In 1759 Carsten left on a journey abroad that was to last for several years, together with his brother [[Peter Anker|Peter]] and four cousins from [[Oslo|Christiania]]. From 1771 to 1772 he was an envoy from several of the major Norwegian trading companies in [[Stockholm]] to negotiate better conditions for the timber trade on the river [[Klarälven]], without much success. While in [[Sweden]], however, there arose suspicion that he was also working with a secret, political agenda, and when [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] conducted his coup d'état, Anker was asked by the government in [[Copenhagen]] to return.

==Civil service career==
[[File:Eidsvollsbygninen.jpg|thumb|300 px|[[Eidsvollsbygningen|Eidsvoll Manor]] in Akershus]]
He then started his career as a civil servant. On 10 May 1774 he was appointed secretary in the ''General-Landøkonomi- og [[Kommercekollegiet]]'' (College of General Rural Economy and Commerce), in 1776 he was made ''justisråd'', in 1781 third deputy of the ''Bjærgværksdirektoiret'' (Mining Directory) and in 1784 second deputy. He was given the, mostly honorary, titles of ''etatsråd'' and ''konferensråd'' in 1779 and 1784 respectively, and on 14 January 1779 he was also made a member of the [[Norwegian nobility|nobility]]. When ''Bjærgværksdirektoiret'' was dissolved by royal resolution on 28 January 1791, Anker was given a pension, but kept a position as first director of the so-called ''Realisations-Kommission'' (Realisation Committee). This position entailed among other things special responsibility for the government's Norwegian glassmaking companies. In 1792 he was made first director of ''det dansk-asiatiske Kompagni'' (the Danish-Asian Company), a position he kept until 1811. He also acquired considerable property in Norway by buying the historic Eidsvoll Ironworks (''Eidsvoll Verk''). He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqSearch=RefNo==%27EC%2F1803%2F06%27&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl |title=Library and Archive Catalogue |publisher=Royal Society |accessdate=13 March 2012 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time abroad==
As an envoy of  ''det dansk-asiatiske Kompagni'', he stayed in London from January 1805 to take care of the company's business affairs vis-à-vis the English [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]]. This task he seems to have performed in an excellent manner. In 1807 he carried out a large transaction of money for the government in [[Hamburg]], and finalised a deal in ship timber for the [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy|navy]]. In 1811 he took up permanent residence at Eidsvoll Ironworks.

==Friendship with Christian Frederik of Denmark==
During his stay in Copenhagen, he had become an intimate acquaintance of the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne, [[Christian Frederik]]. When the prince arrived in Norway as ''stattholder'' in 1813, Anker was immediately made one of the prince's closest advisors. After the [[Treaty of Kiel]] the prince held a meeting at Eidsvoll during his journey to [[Trondheim]], and on the way back he convened the ''Stormannsmøtet'' (gathering of notables) of Eidsvoll on 16 February 1814, where it was decided that Norway should declare its independence, and that a National Assembly should be convened, also to be held at Eidsvoll.

==National Assembly of 1814==
Before the National Assembly gathered, Anker had left Norway, and could therefore not take up his position in the new Norwegian government, where he was appointed councillor of government for the 5th Ministry (economy) on 2 March, and councillor of state on 19 May. In March 1814 he had crossed the [[North Sea]] to promote Norway's interests in England. Here he worked to put the interests of Sweden and the great powers up against each other, but achieved little. In 1815 he was dismissed as councillor of state, and returned to Norway, where he developed a close relationship to the crown prince [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Karl Johan]].

==Last years==
In the last years of his life Anker's economy was not good; the ironworks was virtually closed down. Yet he continued to administer the government's glassmaking companies, and died during a visit to the glassworks at [[Biri, Norway|Biri]]. He had literary interests, acted as a patron, and had a large collection of manuscripts and books. In 1784 he married Hedvig Caroline Ernestine Christine Wegener (1763–1846).

The '''Committee on Data for Science and Technology''' ('''CODATA''') was established in 1966 as an interdisciplinary committee of the [[International Council for Science]]. It seeks to improve the compilation, critical evaluation, storage, and retrieval of data of importance to [[science]] and [[technology]].

CODATA sponsors the CODATA international conference&lt;ref name="Conference"/&gt; every two years.

&lt;!-- redirect anchors for CODATA version numbers can be found immediately above this section header --&gt;
CODATA is best known for (and sometimes confused with) its Task Group on Fundamental Constants (TGFC).  Established in 1969, its purpose is to periodically provide the international scientific and technological communities with an internationally accepted set of values of the [[dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constant]]s and closely related [[conversion factor]]s for use worldwide.

The first such CODATA set was published in 1973.&lt;ref name="CODATA1973"/&gt;  Later versions are named based on the year of the data incorporated; the 1986 CODATA (published April 1987) used data up to 1 January 1986.&lt;ref name="CODATA1986"/&gt;  All subsequent releases use data up to the ''end'' of the stated year, and are necessarily published a year or two later: 1998 (April 2000),&lt;ref name="CODATA1998"/&gt; 2002 (January 2005),&lt;ref name="CODATA2002"/&gt; 2006 (June 2008)&lt;ref name="CODATA2006"/&gt; and the sixth in 2010 (November 2012).&lt;ref name="CODATA2010"/&gt; The latest version is Version 7.0 called "2014 CODATA" published on 25 June 2015.&lt;ref name="CODATA2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CODATA2014Full"/&gt;

The CODATA recommended values of fundamental physical constants are published at the NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty.&lt;ref name="NISTCUU"/&gt;

=== {{anchor|2017|2018}}Schedule ===
Since 1998, the task group has produced a new version every four years, incorporating results published up to the end of the specified year.

In order to support the upcoming [[Redefinition of SI base units|redefinition of the SI base units]],&lt;ref name="Minutes2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CODATA2014Full"/&gt; adopted at the 26th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] on 16 November 2018, CODATA made a special release that was published in October 2017.&lt;ref name="CODATATaskGroup"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The next regular version, with a closing date of 31 December 2018,&lt;ref name="NISTCUU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CODATATaskGroup"/&gt; will be used to produce the new 2018 CODATA values that will be made available by the time the revised SI come into force on 20 May 2019. This is necessary because the redefinitions have a significant (mostly beneficial) effect on the uncertainties and correlation coefficients reported by CODATA.

In a [[dairy]], the '''creamery''' is the location of cream processing. [[Cream]] is separated from whole milk; [[pasteurization]] is done to the skimmed milk and cream separately. Whole [[milk]] for sale has had some cream returned to the skimmed milk.

The creamery is the source of [[butter]] from a dairy. Cream is an [[emulsion]] of fat-in-water; the process of [[churning (butter)|churning]] causes a [[phase inversion]] to butter which is an emulsion of water-in-fat. Excess liquid as [[buttermilk]] is drained off in the process. Modern creameries are automatically controlled industries, but the traditional creamery needed skilled workers. Traditional tools included the [[butter churn]] and [[Scotch hands]].

The term "creamery" is sometimes used in [[retail]] trade as a place to buy milk products such as [[yogurt]] and [[ice cream]]. Under the banner of a creamery one might find a store also stocking [[pie]]s and [[cake]]s or even a [[coffeehouse]] with [[confectionery]].

'''Daniel Hadad''' (born November 28, 1961) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] businessman involved in [[telecommunications]] and [[Broadcast media|media]].

==Biography==
Daniel Hadad was born in [[Buenos Aires ]] in 1961 into a family of Syrian origin. He earned degrees as a [[lawyer]] and [[journalist]] from the [[Universidad Católica Argentina|Catholic University of Argentina]] and completed [[post-graduate]] studies at the [[University of Navarra]], in [[Spain]]. He was granted a scholarship by the Fundación Universidad Río de la Plata to continue his education in [[Washington DC]]. 

Before he became a media businessman, Daniel Hadad worked as a journalist. He first earned renown in 1991 as the morning show co-host on ''Radio América'', and later co-hosted ''Después de Hora'' (''After Hours''). He was also in charge of a radio talk show, ''El Primero de la Mañana'' (''The First of the Morning''). Following the [[privatization]] of most of the nation's airwaves by President [[Carlos Menem]], Hadad launched Radio 10 (a ratings leader in the [[AM radio]] market), in 1998. He acquired a 50% stake in [[Canal 9 (Argentina)|Channel 9]], a leading Buenos Aires broadcaster, in 2002 and purchased the remaining half. Hadad sold the network in December 2007 to Mexican investor Miguel Ángel González and acquired TV News Channel  C5N ([[Canal 5 Noticias|Channel 5]]), which he sold in 2012 together with  Pop Radio, Mega 98.3, FM Vale 97.5, [[Radio 10 (Argentina)|Radio 10]] and TKM Radio. He currently owns ''[[Infobae.com|Infobae]]'' online newsdaily, which won the excellence award "Konex de Platino" in 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5147">The '''dividends-received deduction'''&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Internal Revenue Code Section 243 (regarding domestic corporations) and Section 245 (regarding foreign corporations).&lt;/ref&gt; (or "'''DRD'''"), under [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. federal income tax law]], is a [[tax deduction]] received by a [[corporation]] on the [[dividend]]s it receives by other corporations in which it has an ownership stake.

==History==
{{Empty section|date=June 2008}}

==Impact==
This deduction is designed to reduce the consequences of alleged [[triple taxation]].&lt;ref&gt;"Triple taxation" occurs if, and only if, the taxes paid on the profits are not passed on to the corporation's customers.&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, corporate profits would be taxed to the corporation that earned them, then to the corporate shareholder, and then to the individual shareholder. While Congress allowed for double taxation on corporations, it did not intend a triple - and potentially infinitely-tiered - tax to apply to corporate profits at every level of their distribution. 
The dividends-received deduction complements the [[consolidated return]] regulations, which allow affiliated corporations to file a single consolidated return for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

==Application==
Generally, if a corporation receives dividends from another corporation, it is entitled to a deduction of 50 percent of the dividend it receives.&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Code Section 243(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; If the corporation receiving the dividend owns 20 percent or more, then the amount of the deduction increases to 65 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Code Section 243(c).&lt;/ref&gt; If, on the other hand, the corporation receiving the dividend owns more than 80 percent of the distributing corporation, it is allowed to deduct 100 percent of the dividend it receives.&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Code Section 243(a)(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that in order for the deduction to apply, the corporation paying the dividend must also be liable for tax (''i.e.'', it must be subject to the double taxation that the deduction is intended to prevent).&lt;ref&gt;Internal Revenue Code Section 243(d).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
''The Taxable Income Limitation -''
The dividends received deduction is limited with regard to the corporate shareholder’s taxable income. Per §246(b) of the IRC, a corporation with the rights to a seventy percent dividends received deduction, can deduct the dividend amount only up to seventy percent of the corporation’s taxable income. Furthermore, a corporation with the rights to an eighty percent dividends received deduction can deduct the dividend amount only up to eighty percent of the corporation’s taxable income. There are two exceptions to The Taxable Income Limitation. No taxable income restriction is placed on a corporation with a one-hundred percent dividends received deduction. Second, if the dividends received deduction increases or creates a net operating loss, the limitation does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/publications/p542/ar02.html#en_US_2011_publink1000257826&lt;/ref&gt;

For purposes of determining the appropriate dividends received deduction, a corporate shareholder’s taxable income should be computed without including net operating losses (NOL’s), capital loss carrybacks, and the dividends received deduction.

''The Holding Period Limitation –''
In order to receive the tax benefit of a dividends received deduction, a corporate shareholder must hold all shares of the distributing corporation’s stock for a period of more than 45 days. Per §246(c)(1)(A), a dividends received deduction is denied under §243 with respect to any share of stock that is held by the taxpayer for 45 days or less.

The complexity of this limitation is amplified per §246(c)(4). Section 246(c)(4) states that the stock’s holding period is reduced for any period in which the taxpayer has an option to sell, is under a contractual obligation to sell, or has made a short sale of substantially identical securities. In revenue ruling 94-28, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) explains that the principle behind §246(c)(4) is to deny credit toward the 45-day holding period for any period during which the taxpayer is protected from the risk of loss inherent in the ownership of an equity interest.

''Debt-financed Dividends Received Limitation –''
Code Section 246A disallows the benefit of the dividends received deduction for debt financed purchases of corporate portfolio stock. As stated by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the provision reduces the deduction for dividends received on debt-financed portfolio stock. Therefore, the dividends received deduction is available only with respect to dividends “attributable” to stock financed through other means besides debt. A simple ratio is computed to determine what percentage of an investment is debt-financed. As a result, the dividends received deduction is reduced by the percentage of the investment funded by debt.

'''Ecological Counseling''' offers an approach to the conceptualization of human issues that integrates personal and environmental factors through focusing on their interaction.  By doing so, the widely divergent forces that converge through the development of a human life may be organized into a logical and coherent narrative.  This process attempts to assist people in the recreation of their lives, as is the case with the various forms of counseling.

The theoretical structure of this approach emerges from the integration of [[Field theory (psychology)|field theory]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivism]].  In 1935, [[Kurt Lewin]], a German Gestalt psychologist, articulated that human behavior is a product of personal and environmental factors and formulated the equation B=(PxE).  [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]] expanded Lewin's work in 1979 into [[Ecological Systems Theory]].  Ecological Counseling posits that the person is inextricably situated within radically specific and interdependent ecological systems.  Additionally, the individual carries particular capacities, limitations, temperaments, preferences, symbolic representation systems and personal historicity through the varying environmental settings in which the person lives.  The interactions between the person and environment result in the construction of the individual ecological niches.  These niches are what we experience as our world.

Ecological counseling seeks to understand people's ecological niches and assist them to live a satisfying life.  This is accomplished by improving one's interactional quality, or concordance, through counseling intervention at both the personal and environmental levels.

Ecological Counseling has implications for clinical counseling practice, counselor training, group work, career counseling, social service delivery, research, social justice initiatives, community intervention, consultation, supervision, and human growth &amp; development.

'''Øystein Aarseth''' ({{IPA-no|ˈœʏstæɪn ˈɔʂət|lang}}; 22 March 1968 – 10 August 1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i838.photobucket.com/albums/zz310/chagrynn/Euronymous_passport_1.jpg|title=Euronymous' passport|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; better known by his stage name '''Euronymous''', was a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[guitarist]]. Euronymous was a founder of and central figure in the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]]. He was a co-founder of the Norwegian black metal band [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] and was the only constant member from the band's formation in 1984 until his death in 1993. He was also founder and owner of the extreme metal [[record label]] [[Deathlike Silence Productions]] and record shop Helvete.

Euronymous professed to be a [[Theistic Satanism|Satanist]] and was known for making extreme [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] statements. He presented himself as leading a militant [[cult]]-like group known as the "Black Metal Inner Circle." 

In August 1993, he was murdered by fellow musician [[Varg Vikernes]].

==Biography==

===1984–1991===
[[File:Øystein Aarseth (Euronymous).jpg|thumb|Euronymous in 1987]]
Aarseth formed Mayhem in 1984 along with bassist [[Necrobutcher|Jørn "Necrobutcher" Stubberud]] and drummer [[Kjetil Manheim]]. At the time he was going by the stage name Destructor but later changed his name to Euronymous,&lt;ref name=diaries39&gt;{{cite book |title=Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries |last=Kristiansen |first=Jon |year=2011 |publisher=Bazillion Points Books |location= |isbn= |page=39 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived from the demon [[Eurynomos]] which had inspired the [[Hellhammer]] song of the same name.

In summer 1986, Euronymous, Necrobutcher and [[Metalion|Jon "Metalion" Kristiansen]] visited the German [[thrash metal]] band [[Assassin (band)|Assassin]] and recorded the ''Metalion in the Park'' demo under the name Checker Patrol, Metalion contributing background vocals to the title song "Metalion in the Park."&lt;ref name=checkerpatrol&gt;Kristiansen, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, [[Per "Dead" Ohlin]] became Mayhem's vocalist and [[Jan Axel Blomberg|Jan Axel "Hellhammer" Blomberg]] became its drummer. By 1991, Dead, Euronymous and Hellhammer were living in a house in the woods near [[Kråkstad]], which was used as a place for the band to rehearse.&lt;ref name=purefucking&gt;{{cite video |people=Stefan Rydehed (director) |year=2008 |title=Pure Fucking Mayhem |url= |format= |medium=motion picture |publisher=Index Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayhem bassist Necrobutcher said that, after living together for a while, Dead and Euronymous "got on each other's nerves a lot" and "weren't really friends at the end."&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt; Hellhammer recalls that Dead once went outside to sleep in the woods because Euronymous was playing synth music that Dead hated. Euronymous then went outside and began shooting into the air with a shotgun.&lt;ref name=LoC52&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Varg Vikernes]] claims that Dead once stabbed Euronymous with a knife.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 1991, Dead was found dead by Euronymous at his home with slit wrists and a [[shotgun]] wound to the head. Dead's death was considered [[suicide]]. Before calling the police, he went to a shop and bought a disposable camera with which he photographed the body, after rearranging some items.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt;&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;&lt;ref name=LoC49&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album: ''[[Dawn of the Black Hearts]]''.&lt;ref name=soundsofdeath&gt;[http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-sod.htm ''Sounds of Death'' magazine (1998): Hellhammer interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823184150/http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-sod.htm |date=23 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Necrobutcher recalls how Euronymous told him of the suicide:&lt;blockquote&gt;Øystein called me up the next day ... and says, "Dead has done something really cool! He killed himself". I thought, have you lost it? What do you mean cool? He says, "Relax, I have photos of everything". I was in shock and grief. He was just thinking how to exploit it. So I told him, "OK. Don't even fucking call me before you destroy those pictures".&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Campion |title=In the Face of Death |date=20 February 2005 |publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1419364,00.html |work=[[The Observer]] |accessdate=6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Euronymous used Dead's suicide to foster Mayhem's "evil" image and claimed Dead had killed himself because death metal had become "trendy" and commercialized.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; In time, rumors spread that Euronymous had made a [[stew]] with bits of Dead's brain and had made [[necklace]]s with bits of his skull.&lt;ref name=murdermusic&gt;{{cite video|people=Michael Dome (director) |year=2007 |title=Murder Music: Black Metal |url=http://www.rockworld.tv/MurderMusicPlayer.html |format= |medium=motion picture |publisher=Rockworld TV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014183138/http://rockworld.tv/MurderMusicPlayer.html |archivedate=14 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band later denied the former rumor but confirmed that the latter was true.&lt;ref name=soundsofdeath/&gt;&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; Moreover, Euronymous claimed to have given these necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy,&lt;ref name=sam&gt;{{cite video |people=Sam Dunn (director) |year=2005 |title=[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]] |url= |format= |medium=motion picture |publisher=Seville Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was confirmed by several other members of the scene, like [[Faust (musician)|Bård "Faust" Eithun]]&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; and Metalion.&lt;ref&gt;Kristiansen, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Necrobutcher later speculated that taking the photographs and forcing others to see them was a way for Euronymous to cope with the shock of seeing his friend dead.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime&gt;{{cite video |people=Martin Ledang (director), Pål Aasdal (director) |year=2007 |title=Once Upon a Time in Norway |url= |format= |medium=motion picture |publisher=Another World Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; He claimed that Euronymous "went into a fantasy world."&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; Faust of [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]] believes that Dead's suicide "marked the point at which, under Euronymous' direction, the black metal scene began its obsession with all things satanic and evil."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Kjetil Manheim said that, after the suicide, Euronymous "tried to be as extreme as he had talked about."&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; The suicide caused a rift between Euronymous and some of his friends, who were disgusted by his attitude towards Dead before the suicide, and his behavior afterwards. Necrobutcher ended his friendship with Euronymous.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; Thus, after the suicide, Mayhem was left with only two members: guitarist Euronymous and drummer Hellhammer. [[Stian Johannsen|Stian "Occultus" Johannsen]] was recruited as Mayhem's new singer and bassist. However, this was short-lived; he left the band after receiving a death threat from Euronymous.&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt;

===1991–1993===
[[File:Helvete Oslo - black metal graffiti.jpg|thumb|The basement of Euronymous' former record shop, showing graffiti from the early 1990s]]
During May–June 1991,&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Euronymous opened a record shop named ''Helvete''&lt;ref name=EuronymousInterview&gt;{{cite web |title=Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth |date=June 1992 |url=http://www.angelfire.com/band/mayhem/euro2.html |accessdate=10 October 2009 |quote=''Well, the original idea was to make a specialist shop for metal in general, but that's a long time ago. Normal metal isn't very popular any more, all the children are listening to 'death' metal now. I'd rather be selling Judas Priest than Napalm Death, but at least now we can be specialized within 'death' metal and make a shop where all the trend people know that they will find all the trend music. This will help us earning money so that we can order more EVIL records to the evil people. But no matter how shitty music we have to sell, we'll make a BLACK METAL look on the shop, we've had a couple of 'actions' in churches lately, and the shop is going to look like a black church in the future. We've also thought about having total darkness inside, so that people would have to carry torches to be able to see the records.'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909160330/http://www.angelfire.com/band/mayhem/euro2.html |archivedate=9 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] for "[[hell]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dokpro.uio.no/perl/ordboksoek/ordbok.cgi?OPP=helvete&amp;bokmaal=S%F8k+i+Bokm%E5lsordboka&amp;ordbok=bokmaal&amp;alfabet=n&amp;renset=j|title=Norwegian dictionary entry for "Helvete"|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Schweigaards gate 56 in [[Oslo]]. Norwegian black metal musicians often met in the shop's basement, including the two members of Mayhem, the members of [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], Varg "Count Grishnackh" Vikernes of [[Burzum]], and Snorre "Blackthorn" Ruch of [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]]. Euronymous also started an independent record label called Deathlike Silence Productions, which was based at Helvete. It released albums by Norwegian bands Mayhem and Burzum, and Swedish bands [[Merciless]] and [[Abruptum]]. Euronymous, Varg,&lt;ref name=untilthelight&gt;{{cite video |people=Aaron Aites (director, producer), Audrey Ewell (director, producer) |year=2009 |title=[[Until the Light Takes Us]] |url= |format= |medium=motion picture |publisher=Variance Films}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Emperor guitarist [[Samoth|Tomas 'Samoth' Haugen]]&lt;ref name=hist2&gt;{{cite book |last=Christe |first=Ian |title=Sound of the Beast: the Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Inc |year=2003 |location=New York, New York |isbn= |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; all lived at Helvete at various times. Emperor drummer Faust also lived and worked there.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; The shop's walls were painted black and bedecked with medieval weapons, posters of bands, and [[picture disc]]s, while its window featured a polystyrene tombstone.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

According to Occultus, the space that Euronymous rented "was far too big and the rent was too high. That's the reason why it never did well." Only a small part of the building was used for the shop itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it became the focal point of the Norwegian black metal scene. Metalion, writer of the fanzine ''Slayer'', said that the opening of Helvete was "the creation of the whole Norwegian Black Metal scene."&lt;ref name=LoC39&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Ekeroth wrote in 2008,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Within just a few months [of Helvete opening], many young musicians had become obsessed with Euronymous and his ideas, and soon a lot of Norwegian death metal bands transformed into black metal bands. Amputation became Immortal, [[Thou Shalt Suffer]] turned into Emperor, and Darkthrone swapped their Swedish-inspired death metal for primitive black metal. Most notoriously, [[Old Funeral]]'s guitar player [[Varg Vikernes | Kristian (later renamed as Varg) Vikernes]] had already left the band to form his own creation, Burzum.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Ekeroth: [https://books.google.com/books?id=jRRvfWp95FIC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Swedish Death Metal'']. Second printing. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points 2009, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Euronymous helped many younger bands in the scene, especially Emperor and Enslaved, both of whom he recommended to Candlelight Records.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Dayal. ''Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult''. Feral House, 2013. p.156&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ihsahn]] of Emperor said that "if you were trusted, if they knew you were serious in your views, you were accepted" by the Helvete scene.&lt;ref name=loc65/&gt; Euronymous "took Vikernes, who was five years younger than him, under his wing: inviting him to play bass with Mayhem and offering to release his music as Burzum".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lifedeathprizes.com/real-life-crime/oystein-aarseth-murdered-by-varg-vikernes-64542|title=What drove this black-metal star to stab his bandmate 23 times?|date=2017-09-02|work=Life Death Prizes|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, it has been claimed that their friendship turned to rivalry. Looking back, Faust said: "It sounds really silly, but I think there was a little bit of a contest between them to see who could be more evil. It created a very difficult situation, especially for Euronymous, who wanted the glamour and the showbiz. With him, there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire".&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

[[File:Holmenkollen kapell 0003.jpg|thumb|left|Euronymous took part in the [[Holmenkollen Chapel#Fire and reconstruction|burning of Holmenkollen Chapel]] (pictured)]]
On 6 June 1992, the [[Fantoft Stave Church]] in [[Bergen]] was destroyed by [[arson]]. Vikernes is strongly suspected as the culprit but was never convicted.&lt;ref name=LoC78&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; There followed a wave of church burnings across Norway perpetrated by musicians and fans of the Norwegian black metal scene.&lt;ref name=EuronymousInterview/&gt;&lt;ref name=grude&gt;{{cite video |people=Grude, Torstein (director) |year=1998 |title=Satan rir Media |medium=motion picture |location=Norway |publisher=Grude, Torstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euronymous was present at the burning of [[Holmenkollen Chapel]] together with Vikernes and Faust,&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt;&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;&lt;ref name=LoC117/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristiansen, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; who were convicted for the arson after Euronymous was dead. Faust says he believes that Euronymous got involved because he "felt he had to prove that he could be a part of it and not just in the background."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; To coincide with the release of Mayhem's ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'', Vikernes and Euronymous had allegedly plotted to bomb [[Nidaros Cathedral]], which appears on the album cover. Euronymous' death in August 1993 put an end to this plan and stalled the album's release.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; In a 1993 interview on a Swedish radio show, Euronymous said of the church burnings:&lt;blockquote&gt;They [Christians] must feel that there is a dark, evil power present that they have to fight, which…will make them more extreme. We also believe that when a church burns it's not only Christians who suffer, but people in general. Imagine a beautiful old stave church...what happens when it burns? The Christians feel despair, God's house is destroyed and ordinary people will suffer from grief because something beautiful was destroyed. So you end up spreading grief and despair, which is a good thing.&lt;ref name=radioint&gt;Interview with Euronymous of Mayhem on a Swedish radio show, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 1993, an article in one of Norway's biggest newspapers, ''[[Bergens Tidende]]'', brought the black metal scene into the media spotlight.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', pp. 95–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Varg Vikernes (using his pseudonym Count Grishnackh) gave an anonymous interview to a journalist from the newspaper, in which he claimed to have burnt the churches and [[Early Norwegian black metal scene#Murder of Magne Andreassen|killed a man in Lillehammer]].&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt; According to Vikernes, the anonymous interview was planned by himself and Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal and get more customers for Helvete.&lt;ref name=countregret&gt;[http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2009_interview_dagbladet.shtml "Count" Regrets Nothing]. Burzum.org.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt; However, by the time the article was printed, Vikernes had already been arrested. Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence. Vikernes himself was released in March 1993, also for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=LoC95-97/&gt; That month, ''[[Kerrang!]]'' published an article about the Norwegian black metal scene. In it, Euronymous and Vikernes presented themselves as leaders of a militant, cult-like group of "Satanic terrorists." Euronymous claimed that Helvete helps fund its activities, but said that he is not directly involved in its crimes, because if he was caught the organization would fall apart.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', pp.99-101&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''Bergens Tidende'' episode, Euronymous decided to shut Helvete as it began to draw the attention of the police and media. Vikernes and the authors of ''Lords of Chaos'' claim that Euronymous' parents pressured him into shutting Helvete.&lt;ref name=LoC120&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torstein Grude: ''[[Satan rir media]]'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder===
In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes, as well as between Euronymous and the Swedish black metal scene as a whole.&lt;ref name=LoC117&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes and Snorre "Blackthorn" Ruch drove from Bergen to Euronymous' apartment at Tøyengata&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt; in Oslo. Upon their arrival, a confrontation began, and Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous. His body was found on the stairs outside the apartment with 23 stab wounds—two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back.&lt;ref&gt;Steinke, Darcey. "Satan's Cheerleaders". ''[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]''. February 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Euronymous' murder was initially blamed on Swedish black metallers by the media.&lt;ref name=LoC117/&gt;

It has been speculated{{by whom|date=February 2017}} that the murder was the result of a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records, or an attempt at "outdoing" the stabbing in Lillehammer.&lt;ref name=Yahoo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/mayhem/biography/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130209232033/http://music.yahoo.com/mayhem/biography/|deadurl=yes|title=Mayhem Biography - Yahoo! Music|date=9 February 2013|archivedate=9 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an [[electroshock weapon]], tie him up, and [[torture]] him to death while [[snuff film|videotaping the event]]. Vikernes explains: "If he was talking about it to everybody and anybody I wouldn't have taken it seriously. But he just told a select group of friends, and one of them told me."&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt; He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned [[contract]] to ambush him.&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;&lt;ref name=burzumstory2&gt;Vikernes, Varg: [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story02.shtml ''A Burzum Story: Part II - Euronymous'']. Burzum.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackthorn stood outside smoking while Vikernes climbed the stairs to Euronymous' apartment on the fourth floor.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; Vikernes said he met Euronymous at the door and handed him the contract, but when he stepped forward and confronted Euronymous, Euronymous "panicked" and kicked him in the chest.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; The two got into a struggle and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. Vikernes defends that most of Euronymous' cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; After the murder, Vikernes and Blackthorn drove back to Bergen. On the way, they stopped at a lake where Vikernes disposed of his bloodstained clothes.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; The self-defense story is doubted by Faust&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; and other members of the scene.

According to Vikernes, Blackthorn only came along to show Euronymous some new guitar riffs and was "in the wrong place at the wrong time".&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; Blackthorn claims that, in the summer of 1993, he was almost [[Involuntary commitment|committed]] to a [[psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]] but fled to Bergen and stayed with Vikernes. He said Vikernes planned to murder Euronymous and pressured him into coming along. Blackthorn said of the murder, "I was neither for nor against it. I didn't give a shit about Øystein".&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes called Blackthorn's claims a "defense […] to make sure I couldn't blame him [for the murder]".&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt;

====Aftermath====
Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen.&lt;ref name=LoC120/&gt; Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were also taken in for questioning. The trial began on 2 May 1994. At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn, and another friend had planned the murder. The third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi. To make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes' credit card.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May 1994,&lt;ref name=countregret/&gt; Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150&amp;nbsp;kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, "presumably as a statement of symbolic support".&lt;ref name=LoC141&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Blackthorn was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice.&lt;ref name=LoC141/&gt;

At Euronymous' funeral, Hellhammer (Mayhem's drummer) and Necrobutcher (Mayhem's former bassist) decided to continue with the band and worked on releasing the ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'' album.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Before the release, Euronymous' family asked Hellhammer to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said: "I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was rerecording the bass parts, but I never did."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; The album, which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar, was finally released in May 1994.

A part of the Norwegian scene considered Vikernes a traitor for murdering Euronymous&lt;ref name=nordicmetal&gt;Various Artists: ''Nordic Metal - A Tribute to Euronymous''. [[Necropolis Records]], 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--I don't doubt this, but we should use a better source.--&gt; and turning his back on [[Satanism]] in favor of nationalism and [[Odinism]],&lt;ref name=loc139&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; although Vikernes claims he was never a Satanist and had only used Satan to provoke. They saw Euronymous' death as a significant loss to the scene, and some black metallers "have sworn to avenge Aarseth's death."&lt;ref name=loc138&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years after the murder, [[Ihsahn]] of Emperor said, "There's no discipline in the scene anymore, like earlier on around the shop."&lt;ref name=loc65&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, a "cult developed around the memory of Euronymous," and he was hailed by some as "the King"&lt;ref name=nordicmetal/&gt;&lt;ref name=loc138/&gt; or "Godfather of Black Metal."&lt;ref name=loc138/&gt; 

A new generation of musicians also tried to gain credibility by riding on the back of his legacy.&lt;ref name="loc138" /&gt; However, many of Euronymous' friends and bandmates "speak of the killing with a tone of indifference." ''Lords of Chaos'' remarks: "what is striking [...] is how little they care about the lives or deaths of one another."&lt;ref name="Lords of Chaos, p. 137"&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Hellhammer,&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Ihsahn&lt;ref name="LoC120" /&gt; and Samoth&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; claim that Euronymous' death did not affect or at least not shock them. [[Anders Odden]] (a friend of Euronymous at the time) said of the murder: "It wasn't odd that he ended up getting killed. He thought he could threaten to kill people without it having any consequences." He added: "I think many people felt relief once he was gone." Writer and musician [[Erlend Erichsen]] agreed, saying, "Nobody was there to boss them about. The 'black metal police' were gone."&lt;ref name="onceuponatime" /&gt;

==Beliefs and personality==
The book ''Lords of Chaos'' says of Euronymous:&lt;blockquote&gt;He was always dressed in black from head to foot, his hair dyed black for added effect. He sported long, aristocratic mustaches and wore knee-high boots. His black leather biker jacket was decorated with badges [...] When talking, he seemed stern and serious, sometimes with pomposity verging on the theatrical".&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In interviews, Euronymous claimed to be against [[individualism]], compassion, peace, happiness and fun. He claimed he wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil.&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; In a 1992 interview, he said "The [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] [punk] pigs have correctly made themselves guardians of morality, but we must kick them in the face and become guardians of anti-morality."&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he told ''Kill Yourself'' zine, "There is NOTHING which is too sick, evil or perverted" and claimed "I have no problem with killing someone in cold blood."&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; Metalion (who knew Euronymous since 1985&lt;ref name=diaries39/&gt; and considered him his best friend)&lt;ref&gt;Kristiansen, pp. 266-269.&lt;/ref&gt; said Euronymous "was always telling what he thought, following his own instincts [...] worshipping death and being extreme".&lt;ref name="LoC39"/&gt; Euronymous' shop attracted a lot of new young fans, many of whom looked up to and even idolized him.&lt;ref name="cult155"&gt;''Black Metal: Evolution of the Cult'', p.155&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some who knew Euronymous claim that "the extreme Satanic image he projected was, in fact, just that — a projection which bore little resemblance to his real personality."&lt;ref name="Lords of Chaos, p. 137"/&gt; They include [[Necrobutcher]],&lt;ref name="cult155"/&gt; [[Kjetil Manheim]],&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt;&lt;!--the documentary makes clear that Manheim remained friends with Euronymous long after leaving the band--&gt; Vikernes&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt; and Blackthorn.&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Faust said that with Euronymous, "there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire."&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; When asked why Euronymous made such extreme statements to the press, Ihsahn said: "I think that was very much to create fear among people."&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the scene "wanted to be in opposition to society" and "tried to concentrate more on just being 'evil' than having a real Satanic philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 218f.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayhem drummer Kjetil Manheim (Euronymous' friend from 1983 until his death) described him as "health oriented ... A nice guy, a family guy," but said that when his older friends weren't around, "he could play out his role." Manheim claimed that Euronymous became "extreme" towards the end of his life: "He liked telling people that they were worthless; that he was the best. He was all 'I define black metal. Black metal is me!' … I think he was trapped in the image of Mayhem. He became a [[megalomaniac]]."&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; In the documentary ''Pure Fucking Mayhem'', he said "Øystein's daily life was a total theater" that was based on the black metal "[[archetype]]" of Euronymous.&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt;

===Religion===
In interviews, Euronymous said he was a [[Theistic Satanism|theistic Satanist]].&lt;ref name=religious&gt;Esa Lahdenpera: {{cite web |url=http://www.fmp666.com/moonlight/mayhem.html |title=''Northern Black Metal Legends'' |accessdate=2012-02-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207234358/http://www.fmp666.com/moonlight/mayhem.html |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}. In: ''Kill Yourself'', no. 2, August 1993. Retrieved 30 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fanatic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smnnews.com/board/showthread.php?threadid=32213|title=Rare Euronymous interview - SMNnews Forums&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an interview by Esa Lahdenperä conducted in August 1993, Euronymous stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe in a horned devil, a personified Satan. In my opinion all the other forms of Satanism are bullshit. [...] Satanism comes from religious Christianity, and there it shall stay. I'm a religious person and I will fight those who misuse His name. People are not supposed to believe in themselves and be individualists. They are supposed to OBEY, to be the SLAVES of religion.&lt;ref name=religious/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The theistic Satanism espoused by Euronymous was an inversion of [[Roman Catholic]] dogma&lt;ref name=religious/&gt;&lt;ref name=fanatic/&gt;, and he claimed "We praise the evil and we believe blindly in a godly creature just like a Christian."&lt;ref name=beat&gt;[http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/euronymous-of-mayhem-1993-beat-issue-02/ Interview with Euronymous from ''Beat'', Issue 2 (1993)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125005627/http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/euronymous-of-mayhem-1993-beat-issue-02/ |date=25 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[relationship between religion and science]], he said: "Scientists can't disprove [...] religion. No matter how hard you try, you can't explain the universe. You can't leave out a religious belief."&lt;ref name=beat/&gt;

He opposed the Satanic and [[occultism|occultist]] teachings of [[Anton LaVey]] and [[Aleister Crowley]], for unlike Euronymous, they promoted what he saw as "peace" and commercial frivolity, as well as individualism in contrast to [[dogma]].&lt;ref name=religious/&gt;&lt;ref name=fanatic/&gt; He said he would "never accept any band which preaches [[Church of Satan]] ideas, as they are just a bunch of freedom and life-loving [[Atheism|atheists]], and they stand exactly the opposite of me."&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; When asked what he thought of Crowley's code of "[[Thelema|do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law]]", he answered, "People shall do what WE want them to do. We're against freedom, and forced a band from Rogaland in Norway—Belsebub—to split up."&lt;ref name=beat/&gt;

As noted earlier, some of those who knew Euronymous claim that his "extreme Satanic image" was an act. While [[Mortiis]] said that Euronymous "was such a devil worshipper you wouldn't believe it,"&lt;ref&gt;Ian Christe: ''Sound of the Beast: the Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal''. New York, NY: HarperCollins, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; in the black metal documentary ''Until the Light Takes Us'', Varg Vikernes claimed that Euronymous was not a Satanist. He said: "To Aarseth everything was about image and he wanted to appear extreme. He wanted people to think of him as being extreme; the most extreme of them all. But he didn't want to ''be'' extreme and he wasn't ''really'' extreme."&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt; While Metalion, who was friends with both Vikernes and Euronymous when the latter died, and called Euronymous his best friend,&lt;ref&gt;Jon Kristiansen: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Bazillion Points Books 2011, pp. 266-269.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that "some people in our scene read a few books and considered themselves Satanists," he made no such statements about Euronymous.{{sfn|Kristiansen|2011|p=261f}} Tenebris (allegedly Jon Nödtveidt&lt;ref&gt;Jon Kristiansen: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points Books 2011.{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from the [[Temple of the Black Light|Misanthropic Luciferian Order]], a Swedish Satanic order formed in 1995, wrote that "back then, in 1991, things&lt;!--Do we know what 'things' he's talking about here?--&gt; mainly concerned black metal and ideological Satanism […] and kind of stood and fell with Euronymous and his shop. Therefore, it vanished with his death in '93".&lt;ref&gt;''MLO''. ''Misantropiska Lucifer Orden''. In: Jon Kristiansen: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Bazillion Points Books 2011, p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, some members of the Norwegian scene began to follow [[Paganism]]. Vikernes later claimed that Euronymous—"obsessed with this 'Satanist' thing"—disapproved of Vikernes promoting paganism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=16250 "Updated: Burzum Leader Fails to Return After Short Leave from Prison"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201200958/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=16250 |date=1 December 2008 }}. ''[[Blabbermouth.net]]''. [[Roadrunner Records]]. 26 October 2003. Retrieved 30 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Euronymous showed no explicit disapproval of paganism though, and released the pagan band [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]]'s first album, ''[[Vikingligr Veldi]]'', on Deathlike Silence Productions.

===Black metal and death metal===
Euronymous said that the term "black metal" can apply to any kind of metal so long as it is "Satanic" and "heavy".&lt;ref name=radioint/&gt; He said, "If a band cultivates and worships Satan, it's black metal,"&lt;ref name=orcustus&gt;[http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/interview-with-euronymous-by-bard-faust-for-orcustus-fanzine-unknown/ Interview with Euronymous by Faust in ''Orcustus'' zine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717031130/http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/interview-with-euronymous-by-bard-faust-for-orcustus-fanzine-unknown/ |date=17 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "in a way, it can be ordinary heavy metal or just noise. What's important is that it's Satanic; that's what makes it black metal."&lt;ref name=radioint/&gt; He rejected bands like [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]] being called black metal, "as they are not Satanists," but supported the band nonetheless.&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; As noted earlier, bands who had [[LaVeyan Satanism|LaVeyan beliefs]] were also rejected.&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; When it was pointed out that [[Venom (band)|Venom]] (the band that coined the term "black metal") only used Satanism as a gimmick, Euronymous said that he and the Black Circle "choose to believe otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, Euronymous said that the term [[death metal]] can apply to any kind of metal, so long as the band "cultivates and worships death."&lt;ref name=orcustus/&gt; Euronymous lamented the commercialization and loss of extremity within death metal. He said "Real Death Metal should be something normal people are afraid of, not something mothers can listen to," and "Death Metal is for brutal people who are capable of killing, it's not for idiotic children who want to have [a] funny hobby after school".&lt;ref name=slayer8&gt;[http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/euronymous-and-dead-interview-in-slayer-issue-8-1991/ Interview with Euronymous and Dead in ''Slayer'', Issue 8 (1991)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716160423/http://www.cultofaraluen.com/2011/euronymous-and-dead-interview-in-slayer-issue-8-1991/ |date=16 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many others in the black metal scene, Euronymous originally believed that black metal should stay [[Underground music|underground]]. However, he later changed his mind. He believed that the idea of staying underground came from [[hardcore punk]], and said, "Those who scream most about being in 'underground' is also often those who make so bad music that they don't have a chance to get big themselves." He added: "I wouldn't mind making DSP big and earn a million, as long as I don't change my ways of thinking and being. […] If there were one million black metal fans in the world, most of them would be jerks, but there would be really many true and brutal people as well. The bigger we get, the more we can manipulate people into thinking like us".&lt;ref name=religious/&gt;

===Politics===
Euronymous was interested in [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[communist state]]s such as the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)|Soviet Union under Stalin]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] under [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]].&lt;ref name=communism&gt;{{cite web|url=http://surrealdocuments.blogspot.com/2008/04/euronymous-as-kafka.html|title=Documents: Euronymous as Kafka|first=|last=Valter|date=29 April 2008|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He collected [[Eastern Bloc]] memorabilia&lt;ref name=LoC74/&gt;, and in the '80s, he was a member of the Norwegian communist youth group [[Red Youth (Norway)|Rød Ungdom]], which was [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Coogan: [http://oraclesyndicate.twoday.net/files/how+black+is+black+metal1/ ''How Black Is Black Metal'']. Retrieved 30 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LoC74&gt;''Lords of Chaos'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; He left Rød Ungdom, allegedly because he came to realise that they were "just a bunch of humanists."&lt;ref name=LoC74/&gt; He said "as I HATE people I don't want them to have a good time, I'd like to see them rot under communist [[dictatorship]]."&lt;ref name=communism/&gt; He had a fascination with the idea of [[mass surveillance]], [[secret police]] and [[forced disappearance]].&lt;ref name=communism/&gt; Mayhem's [[Attila Csihar]] said Euronymous was not a communist "in the political sense" but was fascinated by the power communist dictators had over their people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/nl/interviews/view/id/687 Interview with Mayhem]. Lords of Metal.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a private letter written in the early '90s, Euronymous claimed that "almost all" Norwegian black metal bands at the time were "more or less Nazis," including Mayhem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalsucks.net/2017/01/05/editorial-regarding-euronymous-claim-that-almost-all-norwegian-bands-are-more-or-less-nazis/ Editorial: Regarding Euronymous’ Claim that “Almost ALL Norwegian Bands are More or Less Nazis”]. [[MetalSucks]]. 5 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not, however, use the music of Mayhem to promote any kind of politics.&lt;ref name=communism/&gt;

==Instruments==
Euronymous played a Standard sunburst [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar, which can be seen in many pictures of him playing. He stated in various interviews that his and Mayhem's main influences were [[Venom (band)|Venom]],&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]],&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; [[Hellhammer]],&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]]&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], whilst he also liked [[Iron Maiden]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Celtic Frost]] and [[Metallica]].&lt;ref name=religious/&gt; He played through a slightly modified 1981 Marshall Super Lead tube amp and used an Ibanez Tube Screamer pedal, as well as an Arion Metal Master distortion pedal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==Legacy==
Euronymous was ranked No. 51 out of ''The 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time'' by ''[[Guitar World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=18446 |title=Guitar World's 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time |date=23 January 2004 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]] |accessdate=11 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902145402/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=18446 |archivedate=2 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, low-cost carrier [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] set up a public poll asking customers to pick a famous Norwegian historic figure whose picture would decorate the aircraft's tail fin. Aarseth was leading the poll, but his name was removed from the campaign after his family's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.no/20120402/black-metal-stars-family-says-no-to-norwegian-tailfin-honour|title=Black metal star's family says no to Norwegian tailfin honour|date=2 April 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/bummer-alert/mayhems-euronymous-wont-be-the-face-of-norwegian-air|title=MAYHEM's Euronymous Won't Be The Face Of Norwegian Air|date=5 April 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cold Spray (CS)''' (formerly gas dynamic cold spray) is a coating deposition method.&lt;ref&gt;developed in the mid-1980s at [http://www.itam.nsc.ru/index_eng.php The Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics]&lt;/ref&gt; Solid powders (1 to 50 [[micrometre|micrometer]]s in diameter) are accelerated in a [[supersonic]] gas jet to velocities up to 500–1000 [[metre per second|m/s]]. During impact with the substrate, particles undergo [[plastic deformation in solids|plastic deformation]] and adhere to the surface. To achieve a uniform thickness the spraying nozzle is scanned along the substrate.

High pressure cold spray (HPCS) in which the working gas is nitrogen or helium at pressures above 1.5&amp;nbsp;MPa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.matdes.2015.10.075|title=Application of a holistic 3D model to estimate state of cold spray titanium particles|journal=Materials &amp; Design|volume=89|pages=1227–1241|year=2016|last1=Faizan-Ur-Rab|first1=M.|last2=Zahiri|first2=S.H.|last3=Masood|first3=S.H.|last4=Phan|first4=T.D.|last5=Jahedi|first5=M.|last6=Nagarajah|first6=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a flow rate of more than 2&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/min, heating power of 18&amp;nbsp;kW. It is used for spraying pure metal powders with the sizes of 5–50&amp;nbsp;µm. In low pressure cold spray (LPCS), the working gas is a compressed gas with pressure 0.5–1.0&amp;nbsp;MPa, flow rate 0.5–2&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/min and the heating power 3–5&amp;nbsp;kW. It is used for spraying a mechanical mixture of metal and ceramic powders. The inclusion of a ceramic component in the mixture provides high-quality coatings with relatively low energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11666-008-9203-3|title=Review on Cold Spray Process and Technology: Part I—Intellectual Property|journal=Journal of Thermal Spray Technology|volume=17|issue=4|pages=495|year=2008|last1=Irissou|first1=Eric|last2=Legoux|first2=Jean-Gabriel|last3=Ryabinin|first3=Anatoly N.|last4=Jodoin|first4=Bertrand|last5=Moreau|first5=Christian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic principles==
The most prevailing bonding theory in cold spraying is attributed to "[[Adiabatic shear band|adiabatic shear instability]]" which occurs at the particle substrate interface at or beyond a certain velocity called critical velocity. When a spherical particle travelling at critical velocity impacts a substrate, a strong pressure field propagates spherically into the particle and substrate from the point of contact. As a result of this pressure field, a shear load is generated which accelerates the material laterally and causes localized shear straining. The shear loading under critical conditions leads to adiabatic shear instability where thermal softening is locally dominant over work strain and strain rate hardening, which leads to a discontinuous jump in strain and temperature and breakdown of flow stresses. This adiabatic shear instability phenomena results in [[viscous flow]] of material at an outward flowing direction with temperatures close to [[melting point|melting temperature]] of the material. This material jetting is also a known phenomenon in [[explosive welding]] of materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11666-009-9298-1|title=Bonding Mechanisms in Cold Spraying: The Contributions of Metallurgical and Mechanical Components|year=2009|last1=Hussain|first1=T.|last2=McCartney|first2=D.

H.|last4=Zhang|first4=D.|journal=[[Journal of Thermal Spray Technology]]|volume=18|issue=3|pages=364–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1359-6454(03)00274-X|title=Bonding mechanism in cold gas spraying|year=2003|last1=Assadi|first1=Hamid|last2=Gärtner|first2=Frank|last3=Stoltenhoff|first3=Thorsten|last4=Kreye|first4=Heinrich|journal=Acta Materialia|volume=51|issue=15|pages=4379–4394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.actamat.2005.10.005|title=Development of a generalized parameter window for cold spray deposition|year=2006|last1=Schmidt|first1=Tobias|last2=Gärtner|first2=Frank|last3=Assadi|first3=Hamid|last4=Kreye|first4=Heinrich|journal=Acta Materialia|volume=54|issue=3|pages=729–742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key parameters in cold spray ==
There are several factors that can affect the quality of cold-sprayed coatings and the deposition efficiency. Main influential factors are: 
* Gas type, e.g. air, nitrogen, helium
* Gas pressure 
* Gas temperature
* Particle size
* Feedstock material properties, e.g. density, strength, melting temperature 
* Nozzle type
* Substrate
* Deposition kinetics (gun transverse speed, scan velocity, number of passes …)
* Standoff distance, i.e. the distance between the cold spray nozzle and the substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zahiri | first1 = Saden H. | last2 = Antonio | first2 = Christian I. | last3 = Jahedi | first3 = Mahnaz | year = 2009 | title = Elimination of porosity in directly fabricated titanium via cold gas dynamic spraying | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924013608002112 | journal = Int. J. Journal of Materials Processing Technology | volume = 209 | issue = 2| pages = 922–929 | doi=10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2008.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cold spray parameters are selected with respect to the desired coating characteristics and economic considerations. This can be done by considering correlations between process parameters and final coating properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11666-011-9662-9|title=On Parameter Selection in Cold Spraying|journal=Journal of Thermal Spray Technology|volume=20|issue=6|pages=1161|year=2011|last1=Assadi|first1=H.|last2=Schmidt|first2=T.|last3=Richter|first3=H.|last4=Kliemann|first4=J.-O.|last5=Binder|first5=K.|last6=Gärtner|first6=F.|last7=Klassen|first7=T.|last8=Kreye|first8=H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also software packages available for this purpose.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
CS has many advantages that make the technology potentially very competitive. Being a cold process, the initial physical and chemical particle properties are retained and the heating of the substrate is minimal, resulting in cold-worked microstructure of coatings where no melting and solidification happen. Dynamic recrystallization with refined grains has been observed between particle and particle bonding region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2009.07.020|title=Dynamic recrystallization in the particle/particle interfacial region of cold-sprayed nickel coating: Electron backscatter diffraction characterization|journal=Scripta Materialia|volume=61|issue=9|pages=899|year=2009|last1=Zou|first1=Yu|last2=Qin|first2=Wen|last3=Irissou|first3=Eric|last4=Legoux|first4=Jean-Gabriel|last5=Yue|first5=Stephen|last6=Szpunar|first6=Jerzy A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2009.11.034|title=Microstructure and nanohardness of cold-sprayed coatings: Electron backscattered diffraction and nanoindentation studies|journal=Scripta Materialia|volume=62|issue=6|pages=395|year=2010|last1=Zou|first1=Yu|last2=Goldbaum|first2=Dina|last3=Szpunar|first3=Jerzy A.|last4=Yue|first4=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the technology allows to spray thermally sensitive materials and highly dissimilar materials combinations, due to the fact that the adhesion mechanism is purely mechanical.

Other advantages are:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The cold spray materials deposition process|last = Champagne|first = Victor K.|publisher = Woodhead Publishing|year = 2007|isbn = 9781845691813|location =|pages = 63–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* High thermal and electrical conductivity of coatings;
* High density and hardness of coatings;
* High homogeneity of coatings;
* Low shrinking;
* Possibility to spray micro-sized particles (5–10 μm);
* Possibility to spray nanomaterials and amorphous materials;
* Short stand off distance;
* Minimum surface preparation;
* Low energy consumption;
* Possibility to obtain complex shapes and internal surfaces;
* High productivity due to high power feed rate;
* High deposition rates and efficiencies;
* Possibility to collect and reuse 100% of particles;
* No toxic wastes;
* No combustion;
* Increased operational safety due to the absence of high temperature gas jets and radiation.
The jet obtained is a high-density particle beam due to the small size of the nozzle (10–15&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and the short stand-off distance (25&amp;nbsp;mm). This results in high focus of the jet and precise control over the deposition area. Finally, inducing compressive stresses allows to obtain dense uniform and ultra-thick (20 μm – 50&amp;nbsp;mm) coatings.

On the other side, some difficulties can be found. For instance, it is difficult to spray hard and brittle materials because, in this case, mechanical adhesion through plastic deformation could be not as effective as it is for ductile particles. Other problems could include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Near-zero ductility in the as-sprayed condition;
* Need for ductile substrate;
* Difficulty in processing pure ceramics and some alloys as work-hardening alloys;
* high cost of Helium;
* fouling and erosion of the nozzle.

==Applications==

===Coatings===
The ability for CS to deposit materials that are phase-sensitive or temperature-sensitive has positioned the technique to prepare coatings not possible with other thermal spray techniques. CS can generally be used to produce coatings of a wide variety of metals, alloys, and metal-based composites, including those materials that have an exceptionally high melting temperatures (e.g. [[tantalum]], [[niobium]], [[superalloys]]). The process is also valuable for depositing materials that are extremely sensitive to the presence of oxygen and will readily oxidize at modest elevated temperatures – a result which is deleterious to the performance of these materials. Some examples of oxygen sensitive coatings that are commonly produced with CS are aluminum, copper, titanium, and carbide composites (e.g. [[tungsten carbide]]),&lt;ref&gt;Karthikeyan, J. (December, 2004). [http://www.asbindustries.com/documents/int_status_report.pdf "Cold Spray Technology: international status and USA efforts"]. ASB Industries. &lt;/ref&gt; as well as coatings made from amorphous alloys.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, A.P. (January 2006) [http://www.inovati.com/information/literature/amorphous-ni.pdf "Ni-based fully amorphous metallic coating with high corrosion resistance"]. Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials Science, Institute of Metal Research. &lt;/ref&gt;

Additional developments in CS are related to the deposition of ceramic materials on metals, notably [[titanium dioxide]] for photocatalytic effects,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kliemann | first1 = J. -O. | last2 = Gutzmann | first2 = H. | last3 = Gärtner | first3 = F. | last4 = Hübner | first4 = H. | last5 = Borchers | first5 = C. | last6 = Klassen | first6 = T. | doi = 10.1007/s11666-010-9563-3 | title = Formation of Cold-Sprayed Ceramic Titanium Dioxide Layers on Metal Surfaces | journal = Journal of Thermal Spray Technology | volume = 20 | pages = 292–298 | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of CS in [[additive manufacturing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Solid-State Spray Forming of Aluminum Near-Net Shapes|journal= JOM|volume= 49|issue= 8|pages= 31|url= http://www.inovati.com/information/literature/jom97.pdf|doi=10.1007/BF02914398|year= 1997|last1= Gabel|first1= Howard|last2= Tapphorn|first2= Ralph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repair===
Cold spray is now used to repair machine parts in a matter of minutes. Metal (nickel alloys) particles travel in a blend of [[nitrogen]] and [[helium]] gas and gradually stack up on the damaged part to recreate the desired surface. A robot controls the movement of the sprayer. The U.S. Army uses the technology to repair a component in [[Blackhawk helicopter]]s. [[General Electric]] is adapting the technology for civilian applications.&lt;ref&gt;McFarland, Matt. (2013-11-22) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2013/11/22/repairing-an-airplane-engine-on-a-tight-budget-might-become-a-lot-easier/ Repairing an airplane engine on a tight budget might become a lot easier]. The Washington Post. Retrieved on 2016-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing===
Additive manufacturing using cold spray technology can be used to develop parts and components rapidly with deposition rates as high as 45kg/hour - much faster than other additive manufacturing methods.

Unlike other additive manufacturing methods such as [[selective laser melting]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Selective laser melting]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}} or electron beam additive manufacturing&lt;ref&gt;[[Electron-beam additive manufacturing]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=April 2018}}, cold spray technology does not melt metals. This means that metals are not affected by heat-related distortion, and parts do not need to be manufactured in an inert gas or vacuum sealed environment, allowing the creation of much larger structures. The world's largest and fastest metal 3D printer has a build envelope of 9 x 3 x 1.5m and utilizes gas dynamic cold spray. Manufacturing with cold spray technology provides advantages such as the ability to create shapes with no shape or size constraints, more efficient buy-to-fly ratio when compared to machining, and capable of fusing dissimilar metals to create hybrid metal parts - materials such as titanium alloys, copper, zinc, stainless steel, aluminium, nickel, even hastelloy and inconel can be sprayed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/MF/Areas/Metals/Cold-Spray | title=Cold spray for melt-less direct manufacturing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HSP IF IgA.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Photomicrograph of a [[histology|histological section]] of human skin prepared for '''direct immunofluorescence''' using an anti-IgA antibody. The skin is from a patient with [[Henoch–Schönlein purpura]]: IgA deposits are found in the walls of small superficial capillaries (yellow arrows). The pale wavy green area on top is the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], the bottom fibrous area is the [[dermis]].]]
[[File:Immunofluorescence.jpg|thumb|These figures demonstrates the basic mechanism of immunofluorescence. Primary immunofluorescence is depicted on the left, which shows an antibody with a fluorophore group bound to it directly binding to the epitope of the antigen for which it is specific. Once the antibody binds to the epitope, the sample can be viewed under fluorescent microscope to confirm the presence of the antigen in the sample. Conversely, secondary immunofluorescence is depicted to the right, which shows that first an untagged primary antibody binds to the epitope of the antigen in a mechanism similar to the one described above. However, after the primary antibodies have bound to their target, a secondary antibody (tagged with a fluorophore) comes along. This secondary antibody’s binding sites are specific for the primary antibody that’s already bound to the antigen, and therefore the secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody. This method allows for more fluorophore-tagged antibodies to attach to their target, thus increasing the fluorescent signal during microscopy.]]
'''Immunofluorescence''' is a technique used for [[optical microscope|light]] [[microscopy]] with a [[fluorescence microscope]] and is used primarily on [[microbiological]] samples. This technique uses the specificity of [[antibodies]] to their [[antigen]] to target [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[dyes]] to specific [[biomolecule]] targets within a cell, and therefore allows visualization of the distribution of the target molecule through the sample.

==Types==
[[Image:Lupus band test.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Photomicrograph of a [[histology|histological section]] of human skin prepared for '''direct immunofluorescence''' using an anti-IgG antibody. The skin is from a patient with systemic [[lupus erythematosus]] and shows IgG deposit at two different places: The first is a band-like deposit along the epidermal [[basement membrane]] ("lupus band test" is positive). The second is within the nuclei of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] cells (anti-nuclear antibodies).]]

=== Preparation of fluorescence ===
To make fluorochrome-labeled antibodies, a fluorochrome must be conjugated ("tagged") to the antibody. Likewise, an antigen can also be conjugated to the antibody with a fluorescent probe in a technique called fluorescent antigen technique. Staining procedures can apply to both fixed antigen in the cytoplasm or to cell surface antigens on live cells, called "membrane immunofluorescence". It is also possible to label the complement of the antibody-antigen complex with a fluorescent probe.  In addition to the element to which fluorescence probes are attached, there are two general classes of immunofluorescence techniques: primary and secondary. The following descriptions will focus primarily on these classes in terms of conjugated antibodies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are two classes of immunofluorescence techniques, primary (or direct) and secondary (or indirect).

===Primary (direct)===
Primary (direct) immunofluorescence uses a single, primary antibody, chemically linked to a [[fluorophore]]. The primary antibody recognizes the target molecule (antigen) and binds to a specific region called the epitope. The attached fluorophore can be detected via fluorescent microscopy, which, depending on the messenger used, will emit a specific wavelength of light once excited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.dako.com/08002_03aug09_ihc_guidebook_5th_edition_chapter_10.pdf | chapter = Immunohistochemical Staining Methods | title = IHC Guidebook | edition = Sixth | date = 2013 | publisher = Dako Denmark A/S, An Agilent Technologies Company }}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct immunofluorescence, although somewhat less common, has notable advantages over the secondary (indirect) procedure. The direct attachment of the messenger to the antibody reduces the number of steps in the procedure, saving time and reducing non-specific background signal.&lt;ref name=Frit&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fritschy | first1 = Jean-Marc | last2 = Härtig | first2 = Wolfgang | name-list-format = vanc | title = Immunofluorescence | doi = 10.1038/npg.els.0001174 | url = http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0001174.html | year = 2001 | journal = ELS | isbn = 978-0-470-01590-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This also limits the possibility of antibody cross-reactivity and possible mistakes throughout the process.

However, some disadvantages do exist in this method. Since the number of fluorescent molecules that can be bound to the primary antibody is limited, direct immunofluorescence is substantially less sensitive than indirect immunofluorescence and may result in false negatives. Direct immunofluorescence also requires the use of much more primary antibody, which is extremely expensive, sometimes running up to $400.00/mL.

===Secondary (indirect)===
[[File:Blood vessels in porcine skin - SMA A488 - 20x.jpg|thumb|right|A fluorescent stain for [[actin]] in the [[smooth muscle]] of the skin.]]
Secondary (indirect) immunofluorescence uses two antibodies; the unlabeled first  (primary) antibody specifically binds the target molecule, and the secondary antibody, which carries the fluorophore, recognizes the primary antibody and binds to it.  Multiple secondary antibodies can bind a single primary antibody.  This provides signal amplification by increasing the number of fluorophore molecules per antigen.&lt;ref name=Frit/&gt; This protocol is more complex and time-consuming than the primary (or direct) protocol above, but allows more flexibility because a variety of different secondary antibodies and detection techniques can be used for a given primary antibody.&lt;ref name=Frit/&gt;

This protocol is possible because an antibody consists of two parts, a variable region (which recognizes the antigen) and constant region (which makes up the structure of the antibody molecule). It is important to realize that this division is artificial and in reality the antibody molecule is four polypeptide chains: two heavy chains and two light chains. A researcher can generate several primary antibodies that recognize various antigens (have different variable regions), but all share the same constant region. All these antibodies may therefore be recognized by a single secondary antibody. This saves the cost of modifying the primary antibodies to directly carry a fluorophore.

Different primary antibodies with different constant regions are typically generated by raising the antibody in different species. For example, a researcher might create primary antibodies in a goat that recognize several antigens, and then employ dye-coupled rabbit secondary antibodies that recognize the goat antibody constant region ("rabbit anti-goat" antibodies). The researcher may then create a second set of primary antibodies in a mouse that could be recognized by a separate "donkey anti-mouse" secondary antibody. This allows re-use of the difficult-to-make dye-coupled antibodies in multiple experiments.

==Limitations==
As with most fluorescence techniques, a significant problem with immunofluorescence is [[photobleaching]].  Loss of activity caused by photobleaching can be controlled by reducing or limiting the intensity or time-span of light exposure, by increasing the concentration of fluorophores, or by employing more robust fluorophores that are less prone to bleaching (e.g., [[Alexa Fluor]]s, Seta Fluors, or [[DyLight Fluor]]s). Some problems that may arise from this technique include autofluorescence, extraneous undesired specific fluorescence, and nonspecific fluorescence. Autofluorescence includes fluorescence emitted from the sample tissue or cell itself. Extraneous undesired specific fluorescence occurs when a targeted antigen is impure and contains antigenic contaminants. Nonspecific fluorescence involves the loss of a probe's specificity due to fluorophore, from improper fixation, or from a dried out specimen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Immunofluorescence is only limited to fixed (i.e., dead) cells when structures within the cell are to be visualized because antibodies do not penetrate the cell membrane when reacting with fluorescent labels. Antigenic material must be fixed firmly on the site of its natural localization inside the cell.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/643714056|title=Immunofluorescence in medical science : with 28 tab.|last=Akiyoshi.|first=Kawamura,|date=1983-01-01|publisher=Springer u.a|isbn=3540124837|oclc=643714056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intact antibodies can also be too large to dye cancer cells ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name="Sonn_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sonn GA, Behesnilian AS, Jiang ZK, Zettlitz KA, Lepin EJ, Bentolila LA, Knowles SM, Lawrence D, Wu AM, Reiter RE | title = Fluorescent Image-Guided Surgery with an Anti-Prostate Stem Cell Antigen (PSCA) Diabody Enables Targeted Resection of Mouse Prostate Cancer Xenografts in Real Time | journal = Clinical Cancer Research  | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 1403–12 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26490315 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-0503 | pmc=4794340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their size results in slow tumor penetration and long circulating half-life. Research has been done investigating the use of diabodies to get around this limitation.&lt;ref name="Sonn_2016" /&gt; Proteins in the supernatant or on the outside of the cell membrane can be bound by the antibodies; this allows for living cells to be stained. Depending on the fixative that is being used, proteins of interest might become cross-linked and this could result in either false positive or false negative signals due to non-specific binding.

An alternative approach is using [[recombinant protein]]s containing fluorescent protein domains, e.g., [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP). Use of such "tagged" proteins allows determination of their localization in live cells. Even though this seems to be an elegant alternative to immunofluorescence, the cells have to be transfected or transduced with the GFP-tag, and as a consequence they become at least S1 or above organisms that require stricter security standards in a laboratory. This technique involves altering the genetic information of cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chalfie|first=Martin|date=1995-10-01|title=Green Fluorescent Protein|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-1097.1995.tb08712.x/abstract|journal=Photochemistry and Photobiology|language=en|volume=62|issue=4|pages=651–656|doi=10.1111/j.1751-1097.1995.tb08712.x|issn=1751-1097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advances ==
Many improvements to this method lie in the improvement of fluorescent microscopes and fluorophores. Super-resolution methods generally refer to a microscope's ability to produce resolution below the Abbe limit (a limit placed on light due to its wavelength). This diffraction limit is about 200-300&amp;nbsp;nm in the lateral direction and 500-700&amp;nbsp;nm in the axial direction. This limit is comparable or larger than some structures in the cell, and consequently, this limit prevented scientists from determining details in their structure.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.biochem.77.061906.092014|title=Super-Resolution Fluorescence Microscopy|last=Huang|first=Bo|last2=Bates|first2=Mark|date=2009-06-02|website=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.biochem.77.061906.092014|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.77.061906.092014|pmc=2835776|pmid=19489737|access-date=2017-03-24|last3=Zhuang|first3=Xiaowei}}&lt;/ref&gt; Super-resolution in fluorescence, more specifically, refers to the ability of a microscope to prevent the simultaneous fluorescence of adjacent spectrally identical fluorophores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960719686|title=Super-resolution imaging in biomedicine|last=1959-|first=Diaspro, Alberto,|last2=van,|first2=Zandvoort, Marc A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3630">'''Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association''', or '''JAMA''', is a [[trade association]] with its headquarters in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. It was founded in April 1967 and serves as a platform for the [[Japanese automobile industry|automakers of Japan]] to share technological developments and management practices.  There are currently 14 member companies, manufacturing not only cars, but [[truck]]s and [[motorcycle]]s as well. The organization also deals with the manufacturing and distribution of vehicle parts around the world. Together, the companies of JAMA hold a vast share of the markets in the United States, [[Europe]], and many [[developing countries]]. JAMA also has offices located in [[Beijing]], [[Singapore]], [[Washington, D.C.]] (US Office), [[Toronto]] (Canadian Office) and [[Brussels|Brussels, Belgium]] (Europe Office).

== Other brands of member companies ==

The "Big Three" of Japan (Toyota, Nissan, and Honda), each have luxury divisions: Honda's ''[[Acura]]'' (created in 1986), Nissan's ''[[Infiniti]]'', and Toyota's ''[[Lexus]]'' (both created in 1989). Other than limited sales of the Infiniti Q45 these brands were only available outside Japan until 2005, when Lexus was introduced to the [[Japanese domestic market]] ("JDM"). Acura and Infiniti are also planned to be introduced into the Japanese domestic market by 2008. Toyota also began marketing some of its small domestic market cars in the [[United States]] under the ''[[Scion (car)|Scion]]'' marque in 2003.

In Japan, there are also numerous small car manufacturers, coachbuilders, and tuning companies. Companies such as [[Mitsuoka]], [[Spoon Sports]], and [[HKS Co., Ltd.|HKS]] build  production vehicles, sports cars, or one-off concepts in much smaller quantities than the major carmakers, therefore they are not included in JAMA.

'''Jody David Scheckter''' (born 29 January 1950) is a [[South Africa]]n former [[auto racing|motor racing]] driver. He competed in [[Formula One]] from 1972 to 1980, winning the Drivers' Championship in {{F1|1979}} with [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]].

==Career==
Scheckter was born in [[East London, Eastern Cape]], and educated at [[Selborne College]].

===Formula One===
[[File:Scheckter Britain 1974.jpg|thumb|left|Scheckter in a [[Tyrrell 007]] at the [[1974 British Grand Prix]] at [[Brands Hatch]].]]
He rapidly ascended to the ranks of Formula One after moving to Britain in 1970. His Formula 1 debut occurred at the US Grand Prix at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]] in [[1972 Formula One season|1972]] with [[Team McLaren|McLaren]], where he ran as high as third place before spinning and finishing ninth. Immediately becoming a name to watch, he continued his development the following year, winning the [[1973 SCCA L&amp;M Championship]] and racing five times in F1.  In France, he almost won in only his third start in F1 before crashing into [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], the reigning World Champion, who said after the crash about Scheckter: "This madman is a menace to himself and everybody else and does not belong in Formula 1."&lt;ref name="hof"/&gt; In his next start, the British Grand Prix at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]], Scheckter's spin triggered a major accident which took nearly a dozen cars out of the race.  The [[Grand Prix Drivers Association]] demanded his immediate banishment, which was only put off when McLaren agreed to rest their driver for four races.&lt;ref name="hof"/&gt; Scheckter's [[McLaren M23]] bore the number zero during the Canadian and American Grands Prix of 1973.  Scheckter is one of only two F1 drivers to compete under this number, the other being [[Damon Hill]]. During the practice for the American event at the [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]] circuit, Frenchman [[François Cevert]], who was due to be Scheckter's Tyrrell teammate for 1974, was killed in an appalling accident at the fast uphill Esses corners. Scheckter was behind Cevert when he crashed, and he stopped his McLaren, got out of his car and attempted to help Cevert out of his destroyed Tyrrell, but the 29-year-old Frenchman had been cut in half by the circuit's poorly installed Armco barriers and was already dead. Witnessing Cevert's dreadful accident left an indelible mark on the South African and caused him to abandon his reckless ways, becoming a more mature and calculating driver as a result.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.formula1.com/teams_and_drivers/hall_of_fame/283/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ScheckterJody1976-07-31Tyrrell-FordP34.jpg|thumb|Scheckter in the iconic six-wheel [[Tyrrell P34]] at the [[Nürburgring]] in 1976.]]
[[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]] in 1974 gave him his first full-time drive in F1. Jody rewarded them with a third-place finish in the Drivers' Championship and a pair of wins in [[1974 Swedish Grand Prix|Sweden]] and [[1974 British Grand Prix|Britain]]. During the year, he scored points in eight consecutive races, one of the longer scoring streaks of the time. A slight off-year followed, although he did become the only South African to win the [[South African Grand Prix]], but his third year with the team in 1976 gave him another third-place finish in the Drivers' Championship. In that season, Tyrrell introduced the most radical car in F1 history, the innovative six-wheeled [[Tyrrell P34]]. Although he later went on record as saying the car was "a piece of junk", Scheckter gave the six-wheeler its only win on Sweden's [[Scandinavian Raceway|Anderstorp]] circuit and in his twelve races with the car, he scored points ten times. This included a thrilling race-long battle for the lead in the [[1976 United States Grand Prix|American Grand Prix]] between himself and his great friend [[James Hunt]].

Scheckter left for [[Walter Wolf (industrialist)|Walter Wolf]]'s new team in 1977 and Scheckter gave the team a win in its maiden race. He won twice more with the team and was often on the podium, but finished second on points behind a more dominant [[Niki Lauda]]. A seventh-place finish with the team in 1978 followed and he left the team after the season to join [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] to partner [[Gilles Villeneuve]] in the team's ground effect [[Ferrari 312T|312T4]] car.

Critics felt he would not get along well with the domineering management at Ferrari, but he far surpassed expectations and helped give F1's most recognisable team another Constructors' Championship, while Scheckter's consistent finishes, with three wins among them, gave him the Drivers' Championship in 1979.&lt;ref name="hof"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/teams_and_drivers/hall_of_fame/283/|publisher=Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|title=F1 Teams &amp; Drivers Hall of Fame: Jody Schekter|accessdate=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he struggled badly in his 1980 title defence, even failing to qualify for one race. After managing only two points, Scheckter announced his retirement from the team and the sport. Scheckter was the last driver to win a Drivers' Championship for Ferrari until [[Michael Schumacher]] twenty-one years later in {{F1|2000}}.

==After Formula One==
===Broadcaster===
In 1981 [[CBS Sports]] hired Scheckter as a Pit reporter for its [[F1]] coverage.

Scheckter was brought in by [[ABC Sports|ABC's]] [[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World Of Sports]]  as a Pit reporter for the [[1983 Monaco Grand Prix]].

Scheckter was a guest commentator for ITV during the [[1999 San Marino Grand Prix]], replacing [[Martin Brundle]].

===Other interests===

In 1981, Scheckter won the World [[Superstars]] competition in Key Biscayne, Florida.  He defeated athletes such as [[Russ Francis]], [[Renaldo Nehemiah]], [[Peter Mueller (athlete)|Peter Mueller]], [[Rick Barry]], [[Gaétan Boucher]] and [[Andy Ripley]].  In 1983 he was inducted into the [[International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame]].

After Scheckter's retirement, he founded [[FATS Inc]], a company which built firearms training simulators for military, law enforcement and security organisations. The sale of the company provided funds to allow Scheckter to help the racing careers of his sons [[Tomas Scheckter|Tomas]] and [[Toby Scheckter|Toby]].  Tomas raced in the [[Indy Racing League]] where he won two races. Scheckter's brother, [[Ian Scheckter|Ian]], also raced in F1 for a few years.

In 2004 Scheckter was reunited with his championship-winning Ferrari at the South African two-seater F1x2 Charity Grand Prix at [[Kyalami]] in South Africa.

===Present===
Scheckter now spends his time as a [[Biodynamic agriculture|biodynamic farmer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Formula One's Jody Scheckter Turns to Meat|publisher=foodmanufacture.co.uk|url=http://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/4388/Formula_One's_Jody_Scheckter_turns_to_meat.html|date=1 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223001440/http://www.foodmanufacture.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/4388/Formula_One's_Jody_Scheckter_turns_to_meat.html|archivedate=23 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; having bought [[Laverstoke Park Farm]], near [[Overton, Hampshire]], {{convert|40|mi|km|0}} west of London. As an organic farming expert, Scheckter was featured in 2005 on the Visionhealth DVD and TV documentaries "[[Asthma]]: An Integrated Approach", "[[Arthritis]]: An Integrated Approach" and "[[Diabetes]]: An Integrated Approach". On 20 November 2011, he also appeared on the ''[[Countryfile]]'' television show to make a case for [[organic food]].  Laverstoke Park Farm was also featured on BBC's "Escape To the Country" where Jody showed viewers how [[Buffalo Mozzarella]] was made.  In December 2009, Scheckter announced his intention to produce a [[Biodynamic agriculture|biodynamic]] [[sparkling wine]] by 2012. In 2015 the farm was the setting for ITV's Sugar Free Farm where a group of celebrities had to go sugar free for two weeks whilst working on the farm.  
Embarking on the radical regime were musical theatre star [[Jane McDonald]], comedian [[Rory McGrath]], quiz mastermind and Chaser [[Mark Labbett]], actress [[Tupele Dorgu]], TOWIE's [[James Argent|James 'Arg' Argent]] and actress and singer [[Jennifer Ellison]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, James, ''Decanter.com'' (14 December 2009). [http://www.decanter.com/news/292915.html Jody Scheckter announces Hampshire winery plans]&lt;/ref&gt; He is married and has six children: two, [[Toby Scheckter|Toby]] and [[Tomas Scheckter|Tomas]], from his previous wife Pamela; and four, Hugo, Freddie, Ila and Poppy, from his current marriage to Clare.

'''John Spencer Boscawen''' (born c.1957) is a former [[ACT New Zealand]] member of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]] and as of May 2011, ACT's Parliamentary Leader and former [[Minister of Consumer Affairs (New Zealand)|Minister of Consumer Affairs]] of New Zealand. He came to parliament in the [[New Zealand general election, 2008|2008 general election]] as a list MP, having been ranked fourth. Before entering parliament he was best known for his campaign against the [[Electoral Finance Act]]. He sat on the Finance and Expenditure, Commerce, and Parliamentary Service [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]]s, and is ACT's spokesperson for a range of issues including Housing, Transport, Energy and Economic Development.&lt;ref name="ACT_profile"&gt;[http://www.act.org.nz/john-boscawen ACT New Zealand MP profiles: John Boscawen.]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218121207/http://www.act.org.nz/john-boscawen |date=18 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 he became the president of the ACT Party. On 2 February 2014, after unsuccessfully running for ACT Leader, he relinquished the role of president to allow [[classical liberal]] philosopher [[Jamie Whyte]] to become ACT Leader and [[David Seymour (politician)|David Seymour]] to become the party's new [[Epsom]] candidate.

==Business career==
Boscawen was an accountant in the 1980s, but became [[insolvent]] after borrowing heavily to invest in the sharemarket before the stockmarket [[crash of 1987]]. With help from his parents, he was able to return to investing, developing the K-Mart Plaza in [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]].&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10551827"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10551827 |title=New voices: John Boscawen, Clare Curran, Kanwaljit Singh Bakshi |author=Gower, Patrick |date=13 January 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became an associate member of the [[New Zealand Business Roundtable]].&lt;ref name="ACT_profile"/&gt;

==Member of Parliament==
{{NZ parlbox header}}
{{NZ parlbox|start=2008|end=2011|term=49th|party=ACT New Zealand|electorate=List|list=4}}
{{NZ parlbox footer}}
ACT New Zealand was formed in 1994 and Boscawen became a member the following year. He has served on the party's board and been its treasurer, was [[Epsom (New Zealand electorate)|Epsom]] campaign manager for the [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005 election]] and overall campaign manager in 2008.&lt;ref name="ACT_profile"/&gt; He also donated NZ$100,000 to the party.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10538027"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz-election-2008/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501799&amp;objectid=10538027 |title=Big donations for Act and Greens |date=17 October 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 he was ranked fourth on the ACT party's list. With ACT winning 3.65% of the vote at the [[New Zealand general election, 2008|2008 general election]], Boscawen entered parliament as ACT's fourth MP.

In 2009 Boscawen stood as ACT's candidate for the [[Mount Albert (New Zealand electorate)|Mount Albert]] electorate, in the [[2009 Mount Albert by-election|Mount Albert by-election]]. Boscawen placed fourth (968 votes), winning 4.72% of the votes cast. Boscawen provided the media with one of the memorable images of the by-election, when an environmentalist squashed a [[lamington]] on Boscawen's head during a live televised candidates debate.&lt;ref name="3_News_132778"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Mt-Alberts-Lamington-Massacre-revisited/tabid/728/articleID/132778/Default.aspx |title=Mt Albert's 'Lamington Massacre' revisited |date=4 December 2009 |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 August 2010 it was announced Boscawen would become ACT's deputy leader and take the ministerial roles of consumer affairs, and associate commerce. The position of deputy leader, and consumer affairs, and associate education and defence were formerly held by Heather Roy before her removal. The associate education role was taken over ACT leader Rodney Hide likewise associate commerce by Boscawen.  As the ministerial roles are government roles, they require formal consultation with and approval of the Governor General [[Anand Satyanand|Sir Anand
Satyanand]]. After the May 2011 resignation of [[Rodney Hide]] as leader of the Act party Boscawen tendered resignation of his ministerial portfolios and became the parliamentary leader of the Act party for [[Don Brash]] who became leader outside parliament. His portfolios were transferred to Simon Power, a minister resigning at the end of the [[49th New Zealand Parliament]], so that the prime minister would not have to recommend to the Governor General another member of parliament.

On 9 May 2011 Boscawen was granted the right&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.dia.govt.nz/MSOS118/On-Line/NZGazette.nsf/6cee7698a9bbc7cfcc256d510059ed0b/66e2f34cddaf5011cc257895005ae906!OpenDocument Retention of the title 'The Honourable']'' (9 May 2011) 67 [[The New&amp;nbsp;Zealand Gazette]] 1617.&lt;/ref&gt; to retain the title of the [[Honourable#New Zealand|Honourable]] for his lifetime.

Following the sharp decline in ACT's support in the 2011 general election to 1.07% of the popular vote, Boscawen ceased to be a member of parliament.

Boscawen became the ACT party's new party president in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8219257/Boscawen-named-as-new-ACT-president Boscawen named as new ACT president] ''stuff.co.nz'', 24 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He held that position for just over a year, but after he ran unsuccessfully for the Act Party leadership, he resigned.

==Philanthropy==
Boscawen is a trustee of the [[Auckland Philharmonia]] Foundation and the [[Otahuhu College]] Foundation.&lt;ref name="ACT_profile"/&gt;

'''Battulga Khaltmaa''' ({{lang-mn|Халтмаагийн Баттулга}}, ''Khaltmaagiin Battulga'', {{IPA-mn|xɑɮtʰ.maː.ɡiːŋ ˈbɑtʰ.tʰʊ.ɮɐɢ|}}, born 3 March 1963) is a [[Mongolia]]n politician who has served as the [[President of Mongolia]] since 10 July 2017. He served as Member of the [[State Great Khural]] from 2004 to 2016 and Minister of Roads, Transportation, Construction and Urban Development from 2008 to 2012. He was the [[Democratic Party (Mongolia)|Democratic Party]]'s candidate in the [[Mongolian presidential election, 2017|2017 presidential election]], and was elected President with 50.6% in the run-off, the first ever run-off election in modern Mongolian history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gec.gov.mn/details/2188&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Battulga is a second child. His father and mother are both from [[Ulaanbaatar]]. The family was allocated a traditional “ger” in Yarmag ger district in Ulaanbaatar after they lost everything in the flood of [[Tuul River]] in 1966. Hence, Battulga grew up in the streets of Yarmag and went to a local secondary school. When he graduated from 8th grade, his teacher recommended that he apply to an arts school given his talents. Battulga graduated in 1982. While studying at the Arts School, Battulga sold his paintings to tourists around Bayangol Hotel area, learning sufficient English to help sell his artwork.

His father was a coach of Mongolian traditional wrestling and thus Battulga grew up wrestling. Battulga was a member of the Mongolian National wrestling team in 1979-1990. Battulga won the world cup championship in Ulaanbaatar in 1989. Wrestling allowed Battulga to travel internationally at a period, when travel abroad for Mongolians was not allowed. Battulga was awarded an Merited Sportsmen of Mongolia in 1995, thereafter being selected as the Chairman of Mongolian [[Judo]] Federation in 2006. Under Battulga’s leadership at the Judo Federation, Mongolian judokas became Olympic Champions for the first time in history.

In 1990, Battulga started sewing and selling jeans locally and in Hungary. This allowed him to make $600, sufficient to buy a video camera and to start an export-import business trading electronics from Singapore to Mongolia, Russia and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gencobook.com/blog/-/2016/1/8 Became national bestseller]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 8 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.24tsag.mn/content/17013.shtml “24 Facts from the Biography of a Mongolian Millionaire: Kh.Battulga”] by D.Undrakh, 24tsag.mn, 22 August 2012,&lt;/ref&gt;

Battulga, like many others of his generation was fascinated with ''[[The Godfather]]'' movie. Thus, he named his first company Genco. This nickname has stuck with him ever since.

Genco acquired controlling interests during the privatization of state-owned assets such as Bayangol Hotel and meat-processing factory Makh-Impex in 1997 and 1999 respectively. In the 1990s Genco group started one of the first taxi businesses in Mongolia called City Taxi, retail store operations under Sapporo name, lottery business, restaurant and night club operations, flour milling and bread making factory Talkh Chikher LLC.

==Political views==
{{BLP sources section|date=August 2017}}
In 2004, Battulga became a Member of Parliament for the first time from [[Bayankhongor Province|Bayankhongor province]]. He was re-elected to parliament in 2008 and 2012.

Battulga believes that every Mongolian citizen should benefit from its mineral wealth according to article 6.1 of the [[Constitution of Mongolia]], under which mineral resources are to be developed in consideration of ensuring the nation's economic security and the development of all forms of property and social development of the population. Due to landlocked geography of Mongolia, Battulga views that a unified railway network would enhance the global competitiveness of its national mining industry by creating multiple access points through which the country can target multiple inland and seaborne markets. Furthermore, Battulga believes, given the cyclical nature of commodity markets, industrial clusters designed to do value-add processing of mineral products should be established to create skilled jobs, introduce downstream industrial technologies and diversify the economy, enhancing local purchasing power that would create economic multiplier effect in housing, services and other economic sectors. Battulga thinks that agriculture has a prominent place in diversifying the economy as Mongolia is rich in livestock, about 60 million, with largest consumers of agricultural products as its neighbors. He believes cashmere and leather products could be successfully marketed internationally because of the scarcity factor.

Recognizing these principles, Battulga sponsored the State Policy of Railway Transportation of Mongolia (“Railway Policy”) with the Parliament approving it with 84% votes in 24 June 2010 to construct 5,600&amp;nbsp;km railway base infrastructure in three phases that calls for providing access to multiple seaports in China and Russia, creating three transportation corridors between China, Russia and Europe, as well as establishing and industrial cluster in Sainshand.

Battulga acknowledges that limited human resources and financial capability of Mongolia requires multilateral international participation in the development of the economy, rather than making bilateral arrangement with its neighbors. Battulga strongly opposes control of mineral resources by a few politically connected businessmen reaping of great profits and increase income gap between the rich and the poor, potentially creating political and social instability in the country. For example, as the Minister responsible for development of infrastructure and industrial projects, Battulga encouraged participation of international companies in the development of business cases, feasibility and necessary detailed engineering studies, resulting in selection of Bechtel Enterprises, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Guggenheim, Fluor, McKinsey &amp; Company, Nippon Koei, Pillsbury Winthrop Pittman Shaw LLP, Samsung, Sidley Austin LLP, Taylor Wessing. As a result, many international companies have expressed their interest to invest, provide technologies and construction services, such as Air Liquide (France), Baotou Steel (China), Dandong Port (China), Overseas Infrastructure Alliance (India), OAO Russian Railways (Russia), Rao UES (Russia), Sembcorp (Singapore), Sinohydro (China), Steel Authority of India Limited (India), among many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.eagle.mn/content/read/37605.htm “Stories Behind Imprisonments”] by G.Mongon, Eagle.com, 27 November 2015,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://talkh-chikher.mn/#page-home Corporate website Talkh Chikher LLC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/education/edurights/media/docs/6a6a23469e136afaa4860bf5869f6f8f659c6688.pdf Constitution of Mongolia, Article 5.4], 13 January 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 2012, the Government of Mongolia announced that it resolved to build 1,800&amp;nbsp;km railway infrastructure integrating Phase 1 and 2 of the Railway Policy. Stakeholders such as Hong Kong listed Mongolian Mining Corporation greeted such government policy in its press release stating that the policy is particularly beneficial for Mongolian coal exporters.

Battulga was instrumental in background coordination for preparation work and ultimate signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation between Governments of Mongolia and Japan during official visit of Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] in 22 October 2015. This memorandum expresses intention of Japan to invest in the construction of railway infrastructure from Tavan Tolgoi coal mine to Sainshand railway line connecting it to the Trans-Mongolian Railway Network and providing access to Chinese and Russian seaports. Furthermore, plans have been made for Chinese, Russian and Japanese investments in financing the railway in exchange of coking coal sourcing from Mongolia. Investment blueprint and roadmap was agreed with the Japanese government, Japan Bank for International Cooperation and Japanese major trading companies.

[[File:Vladimir Putin and Khaltmaagiin Battulga (2017-09-07) 01.jpg|thumb|[[Vladimir Putin]] and Battulga Khaltmaa in [[Vladivostok]]]]

Battulga believes foreign direct investment on balanced terms is an important catalyzer for Mongolia’s economic development and job creation. His policies has been aimed at enhancing fair, transparent and reciprocal trade.

Battulga criticizes Mongolian economy’s heavy dependence on a single trade partner, thus faces fierce opposition and attacks from shareholders and stakeholders of coal miners.

==Social contributions==
Battulga sponsored construction of Chingis Khan Equestrian Statue near Ulaanbaatar to celebrate national pride. The statue became one of the main tourist attraction sights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/world/asia/03genghis.html Genghis Khan Rules Mongolia Again, in a P.R. Campaign], [[New York Times]], 2 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://judotalk.com/profiles/blogs/mongolian-judo-from-tradition-to-modernity Mongolian Judo: From Tradition to Modernity], 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Battulga is also the President of Mongolian Judo Association. Under his guidance, Mongolian judoka Tuvshinbayar Naidan became an Olympic Judo Champion in Beijing 2008 and many other successful judokas that have become national heroes. Thanks to these successes judo has become one of the most popular sports in Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lldc2conference.org/custom-content/uploads/2014/06/8-Mr.-Yo.-Manlaibayar-MRT_Railways_WTO-meeting_eng.pdfLand Locked Countries Conference, Ministry of Roads and Transportation of Mongolia]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmc.mn/admin/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Announcement_on_the_government_of_Mon_eng.pdf Mongolian Mining Corporation, Announcement On The Government Of Mongolia’s Decision On Unified Railway Network Development] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921160313/http://www.mmc.mn/admin/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Announcement_on_the_government_of_Mon_eng.pdf# |date=21 September 2013 }}, 4 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museum Of Bad Art''' ('''MOBA''') is a privately owned museum whose stated aim is "to celebrate the labor of artists whose work would be displayed and appreciated in no other forum".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally in [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] with current branches in [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], and [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|South Weymouth]] in [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=Lowbrow&gt;{{cite news |author=Piepenburg, Erik |title=Loving the Lowbrow (It Has Its Own Hall of Fame) |agency= |work=[[The New York Times]] |pages= |page= |date=September 22, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/arts/design/03badart.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its permanent collection includes over 700&amp;nbsp;pieces of "art too bad to be ignored", 25 to 35 of which are on public display at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Walkup, Nancy |title=ArtEd Online&amp;nbsp;— [[National Art Education Association|NAEA]] in Boston&amp;nbsp;— Reproducible Handout |journal=School Arts |volume=104 |issue=7 |pages=36 |date=March 2005 |issn=0036-6463 |oclc=1765119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOBA was founded in 1994, after antique dealer Scott Wilson showed a painting he had recovered from the trash to some friends, who suggested starting a collection. Within a year, receptions held in Wilson's friends' home were so well-attended that the collection needed its own viewing space. The museum then moved to the basement of a theater in Dedham. Explaining the reasoning behind the museum's establishment, co-founder Jerry Reilly said in 1995: "While every city in the world has at least one museum dedicated to the best of art, MOBA is the only museum dedicated to collecting and exhibiting the worst."&lt;ref name=Mutch&gt;{{cite news |author=Mutch, David |title=Art from the Bottom of the Heap: A 'Museum' Devoted to Bad Painting |agency= |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |pages= |page=13 |date=November 2, 1995 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1995/1102/02131.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To be included in MOBA's collection, works must be original and have serious intent, but they must also have significant flaws without being boring; curators are not interested in displaying deliberate [[kitsch]].

MOBA has been mentioned in dozens of off-the-beaten-path guides to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], featured in international newspapers and magazines, and has inspired several other collections throughout the world that set out to rival its own visual atrocities. [[Deborah Solomon]] of ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' noted that the attention the Museum Of Bad Art receives is part of a wider trend of museums displaying "the best bad art".&lt;ref name="solomon"&gt;Solomon, Deborah. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/24/magazine/in-praise-of-bad-art.html In Praise of Bad Art]". ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 24, 1999 &lt;!--Retrieved on March 2, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The museum has been criticized for being anti-art, but the founders deny this, responding that its collection is a tribute to the sincerity of the artists who persevered with their art despite something going horribly wrong in the process. According to co-founder Marie Jackson, "We are here to celebrate an artist's right to fail, gloriously."&lt;ref name="irishtimes"&gt;"[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/1999/0918/99091800051.html The Gallery of the Garish Masterpieces of Bad Art]". ''[[The Irish Times]]'', September 18, 1999. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Museum Of Bad Art was established in 1994 by antique dealer Scott Wilson, who discovered what has become the museum's signature piece—''Lucy in the Field with Flowers''—protruding from between two trash cans on a [[Roslindale, Massachusetts|Roslindale]]-area curb in Boston, among some garbage waiting to be collected. Wilson was initially interested only in the frame, but when he showed the picture to his friend Jerry Reilly, Reilly wanted both the frame and the painting. He exhibited ''Lucy'' in his home, and encouraged friends to look for other bad art and notify Wilson of what they found.&lt;ref name="gaines"&gt;Gaines, Judith. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7775472.html "Exhibiting Works of Trial and Error: Museum Finds Landscapes Gone Awry"]. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', May 4, 2003. 9&lt;/ref&gt; When Wilson acquired another "equally lovely" piece and shared it with Reilly, they decided to start a collection. Reilly and his wife, Marie Jackson, held a party in their basement to exhibit the collection to date, and hosted a reception they facetiously titled "The Opening of the Museum Of Bad Art".&lt;ref name="english07"&gt;English, Bella. [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/04/29/high_standards_for_low_art/?rss_id=Boston%20Globe%20--%20Globe%20South "High Standards for Low Art"]. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', April 29, 2007.

Regular showings of the pieces collected by Wilson, Reilly, and Jackson (and those donated by others), became too much for Reilly and Jackson's small home in [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts]], as hundreds of people attended the receptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Frauenfelder, Mark |title=Canvas Catastrophes |date=July 1995 |work= |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]] |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.07/scans.html?pg=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders' initial attempt at dealing with their constrained exhibition space was to create the Virtual Museum Of Bad Art, a CD-ROM with a cast of 95 people that presented the MOBA art collection in a fictional imaginary museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn18/wn18-1/wn18-113.html MOBS CD-ROM]&lt;/ref&gt;  This fictional MOBA allowed the visitors not only to view the paintings but to go behind the scenes in the fictional museum.

In MOBA's early days, the museum hosted traveling shows; on one occasion the works were hung from trees in the woods on [[Cape Cod]] for the "Art Goes Out the Window—The Gallery in the Woods". [[Aesthetics of music#Bad music|Bad music]] was played during the public viewings to complete the ambiance. In an exhibition titled "Awash in Bad Art", 18 pieces of art were covered in shrink wrap for "the world's first drive-thru museum and car wash". Marie Jackson, formerly the Director of Aesthetic Interpretation noted, "We didn't put any watercolors in there."&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt; A 2001 exhibition, "Buck Naked—Nothing But Nudes" featured all of the MOBA nudes hung in a local spa.

MOBA features its works in rotating collections. In 2003, "Freaks of Nature" focused on landscape artwork "gone awry". A 2006 exhibit titled "Hackneyed Portraits" was designed to "pick up some of the slack" when the [[David Hockney]] show at Boston's [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] closed.&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;Johnson, Carolyn.

In February 2009, MOBA announced a fundraiser to assist the [[Rose Art Museum]] at [[Brandeis University]], which was seriously considering whether to sell masterpieces because of the [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009]], made worse for the university by some of its donors losing money in [[Madoff investment scandal|Bernard Madoff's investment scheme]]. Current MOBA curator and [[Balloon modelling|balloon artist]]/musician Michael Frank placed ''Studies in Digestion''—a four-panel piece showing four renditions of the human digestive tract in various media by artist Deborah Grumet—on [[eBay]] for a buy-it-now price of $10,000; the first bid was $24.99.&lt;ref name="english"/&gt; It eventually sold for $152.53 and the meager proceeds went to the Rose Art Museum, while both museums gained publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, Morgan  Michele.

===Thefts===

The loss of two MOBA works to theft has drawn media attention and enhanced the museum's stature.&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wulff, Julie "All Things Bad and Beautiful". ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', December 13, 2006. SID2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb" /&gt; In 1996, the painting ''Eileen'', by R. Angelo Le, vanished from MOBA.  ''Eileen'' was acquired from the trash by Wilson, and features a rip in the canvas where someone slashed it with a knife even before the museum acquired it, "adding an additional element of drama to an already powerful work", according to MOBA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-9.html Portraiture #9 Eileen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224234034/http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-9.html |date=2015-02-24 }}. Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum offered a reward of $6.50 for the return of ''Eileen'', and although MOBA donors later increased that reward to $36.73, the work remained unrecovered for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belanger|Moran|Sceurman|2008|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Police Department|Boston Police]] listed the crime as "larceny, other",&lt;ref name="irishtimes"/&gt; and Sacco was reported saying she was unable to establish a link between the disappearance of ''Eileen'' and a notorious heist at Boston's famed [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] that occurred in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Chris.

Prompted by the theft of ''Eileen'', MOBA staff installed a fake video camera over a sign at their Dedham branch reading (in Comic Sans): "Warning.

==Collection standards==
[[File:MOBAcamera.JPG|thumb|alt=Camera on a concrete block wall, over a sign reading "WARNING: These premises are protected by a fake security camera"|[[Fake security camera]] at the former Dedham branch of MOBA, photographed in 2009]]

Although the museum's motto is "Art too bad to be ignored", MOBA holds rigorous standards as to what they will accept. According to Marie Jackson, "Nine out of ten pieces don't get in because they're not bad enough. What an artist considers to be bad doesn't always meet our low standards."&lt;ref&gt;Swoger, Kate. "Bad Art Finds a Good Home at This Anti-Museum". ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', February 26, 2000. K6&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in the introduction to ''The Museum Of Bad Art: Masterworks'', the primary attribute of an ''[[Work of art|objet d'art]]'' to be acquired by MOBA is that it must have been seriously attempted by someone making an artistic statement. A lack of artistic skill is not essential for a work to be included; a prospective painting or sculpture for the collection ideally should "[result] in a compelling image",&lt;ref name="saccox"&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|p=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as honorary curator Ollie Hallowell stated, the art must have an "Oh my God" quality.&lt;ref name="english" /&gt;

An important criterion for inclusion is that a painting or sculpture must not be boring. Michael Frank says they are not interested in commercial works like ''[[Dogs Playing Poker]]'': "We collect things made in earnest, where people attempted to make art and something went wrong, either in the execution or in the original premise."&lt;ref name="english"/&gt; Montserrat College of Art used MOBA's exhibition as a demonstration to its students that "sincerity is still important, and pureness of intent is valid".&lt;ref name="hirsch"/&gt;

MOBA accepts unsolicited works if they meet its standards. Frequently, curators consider works by artists who display an intensity or emotion in the art that they are unable to reconcile with their level of skill. The museum dedicated a show to "relentless creativity" in an exhibition titled "I Just Can't Stop" that was covered by local news and [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofbadart.org/about/36.html The MOBA news: The Museum of Bad Art (MOBA) Newsletter, Issue #36 Excerpt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123224026/http://museumofbadart.org/about/36.html |date=2009-01-23 }}. Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists are clearly technically proficient, but attempted an experiment that did not end well.&lt;ref name="architecture"/&gt; Michael Frank has compared  some of the works at MOBA with [[outsider art]] or art brut; some MOBA artists' works are also included in other galleries' outsider collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.walkerart.org/offcenter/2009/01/25/the-museum-of-bad-arts-michael-frank/ The Museum of Bad Art's Michael Frank] ''Off Center'' (2009). Accessed, March 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Dean Nimmer, a professor at the [[Massachusetts College of Art]] (also holding the title of MOBA's Executive Director of Good Taste), noted the parallels between the Museum Of Bad Art's standards and those of other institutions: "They take the model of a museum of fine arts and apply the same kind of criteria to acceptance for bad work&amp;nbsp;... [Their rules] are very similar to a gallery or museum that says 'Well, our area is really installation art or realist paintings or neo-post-modern abstractions.{{' "}}&lt;ref name="goldberg"/&gt;

MOBA does not collect art created by children, or art traditionally perceived as lesser in quality, such as [[black velvet painting]]s, [[Paint by number|paint-by-numbers]], [[kitsch]], or factory-produced art—including works specifically created for tourists. Curators are also not interested in crafts such as [[Rug making#Hooking|latch hook rug]] kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|pp=x–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; MOBA curators suggest that more appropriate venues for such works would be the "Museum of Questionable Taste, The International Schlock Collection, or the National Treasury of Dubious Home Decoration".&lt;ref name="saccox"/&gt;

The Museum Of Bad Art has been accused of being anti-art, or taking works that were sincerely rendered and mocking them. However, Scott Wilson insists that a work of art accepted into MOBA is a celebration of the artist's enthusiasm.&lt;ref name="goldberg"/&gt; Marie Jackson reiterated this thought, saying "I think it's a great encouragement to people... who want to create [and] are held back by fear, and when they see these pieces, they realize there's nothing to be afraid of—just go for it."&lt;ref name="caro"&gt;Caro, Mark, "Not a Pretty Picture—Boston-Area Museum a Monument to the Absolute Worst in Art". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', May 20, 1997. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Louise Reilly Sacco agreed, stating, "If we're making fun of something, it's the art community, not the artists. But this is a real museum. It's 10 years. It's 6,000 people on a mailing list. It's recognition all over the world."&lt;ref name="Cobb"&gt;Cobb, Nathan. [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/02/28/in_dedham_this_museum_is_exhibiting_bad_taste/ "In Dedham, This Museum is Exhibiting 'Bad" Taste"]. ''The Boston Globe'', February 28, 2004. C1&lt;/ref&gt; Curators insist that artists whose works are selected by MOBA enjoy the attention and that it is a [[Win-win game|win-win]]; the museum gains another work of art, and the artist receives exposure in a museum. A 1997 article in ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' stated that none of the 10 to 15 artists who had stepped forward to acknowledge their work in MOBA had been upset.&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

Many of the works in MOBA are donated, often by the artists themselves. Others come from yard sales or [[thrift stores]]; the Trash Collectors Union in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] has donated works rescued from imminent demise. Occasionally a painting may be purchased; at one time MOBA's policy was not to spend more than $6.50 on any piece.&lt;ref name="irishtimes" /&gt; More recently, twice and even three times that amount has been paid for an exceptional work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belanger|Moran|Sceurman|2008|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those pieces not retained by the museum are included in a "Rejection Collection" that may be sold at auction. In the past, some proceeds went to the [[Salvation Army]] for providing so many of MOBA's pieces; the museum itself usually benefits from most auctions.&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

==Collection highlights==
Each painting or sculpture MOBA exhibits is accompanied by a brief description of the medium, size, name of the artist, as well as how the piece was acquired, and an analysis of the work's possible intention or symbolism. ''[[Museums Journal]]'' noted that the discussion accompanying each work would most likely have most visitors reduced "to hysterics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lewis, Jamie |title=Museum of Bad Art, Boston |journal=[[Museums Journal]] |volume=106 |issue=5 |pages=62 |date=May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The captions—described as "distinctly tongue-in-cheek commentaries" by David Mutch of the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]''&lt;ref name=Mutch/&gt;—were primarily written by Marie Jackson, until the "dissolution of the MOBA interpretative staff"; the task was then taken over by Michael Frank and Louise Reilly Sacco.&lt;ref name="saccoxiv"&gt;Frank and Sacco, xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Lucy in the Field with Flowers''===
Many of MOBA's works generate extensive discourse from visitors. ''Lucy in the Field with Flowers'' (oil on canvas by Unknown; acquired from trash in Boston) remains a favorite with the news media and patrons.  As the first work acquired by the museum, ''Lucy'' is "a painting so powerful it commands its own preservation for posterity", setting a standard by which all future acquisitions would be compared, and causing MOBA's founders to question if Scott Wilson found ''Lucy'' or she found him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stankowicz|Jackson|1996|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate Swoger of ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Montreal Gazette]]'' called ''Lucy'' a "gorgeous mistake", describing her thus: "an elderly woman dancing in a lush spring field, sagging breasts flopping willy-nilly, as she inexplicably seems to hold a red chair to her behind with one hand and a clutch of daisies in the other".&lt;ref name="swoger"/&gt; Author [[Cash Peters]], using less florid language, summarized it as "the old woman with an armchair glued to her ass".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peters|2003|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MOBA's statement about ''Lucy'' reads: "The motion, the chair, the sway of her breast, the subtle hues of the sky, the expression on her face—every detail combines to create this transcendent and compelling portrait, every detail cries out 'masterpiece'."&lt;ref name="lucy"&gt;[http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-1.php Portraiture #1 Lucy In the Field With Flowers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226052249/http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-1.php |date=2009-02-26 }}. Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' recounted comments left by a museum visitor regarding the "endless layers of mysteries" the image offers: "What is [[Norman Mailer]]'s head doing on an innocent grandma's body, and are those crows or [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] skimming the hills?"&lt;ref name="Mailer"&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/whats_on/listings/article743688.ece "So Bad It's Good: The Arts Online".] ''[[The Times]]'', March 25, 2006. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lucy''{{'s}} granddaughter, a Boston-area nurse named Susan Lawlor, became a fan of MOBA after seeing the portrait in a newspaper.&lt;ref name="lucy" /&gt; She recognized it as her grandmother, Anna Lally Keane (c. 1890–1968); upon seeing the picture, Lawlor snorted [[Coca-Cola]] from her nose in astonishment.&lt;ref name="stank2"&gt;{{harvnb|Stankowicz|Jackson|1996|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was commissioned by her mother, and it hung in her aunt's house for many years, despite the trepidation family members felt at seeing the final composition. Says Lawlor: "The face is hauntingly hers, but everything else is so horribly wrong. It looks like she only has one breast. I'm not sure what happened to her arms and legs, and I don't know where all the flowers and yellow sky came from."&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

===''Sunday on the Pot with George''===

''Sunday on the Pot With George'' (acrylic on canvas by John Gedraitis; donated by Jim Schulman) has been deemed "iconic" by Bella English of ''The Boston Globe'', who assures the work is "100 percent guaranteed to make you burst out laughing".&lt;ref name="english07"/&gt; Wilson has pointed to ''George'' as an example of a technically well-executed piece of art using a subject not usually seen rendered in paint.&lt;ref name="caro"/&gt;

Many admirers of the first work donated to MOBA are hypnotized by the image of a portly man wearing "Y-front" underwear while sitting on a chamber pot, in [[pointillist]] [[impressionism]] similar to the style of [[Georges Seurat]].  One critic speculates the pointillist style in ''George'' may have been acquired "from watching too much TV".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Citro|Foulds|2004|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title refers to the [[Stephen Sondheim]] musical ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'', which contains a dramatic recreation of Seurat's painting ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]''. Author Amy Levin suggests that ''George'' is a pastiche of Seurat's painting.&lt;ref name="levin198"&gt;Levin, 198&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of this painting has been "tentatively identified" by the ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]''—the creators of the [[Ig Nobel]] award—as  [[John Ashcroft]], former [[United States Attorney General]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The George / John Controversy| work = [[Annals of Improbable Research]]| url = http://improbable.com/projects/george/george-pot.html| accessdate = March 3, 2009| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091008202247/http://www.improbable.com/projects/george/george-pot.html| archivedate = October 8, 2009| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A visitor was so moved by ''George'' he felt compelled to express his gratitude for its display in the Dedham Community Theatre basement, writing "Someone had slipped into the bathroom as I took in this painting and began peeing loudly into a toilet. The reverberating sound of urine splashing while viewing ''George'' brought the painting to life, and when the denouement of the flush sounded, I wept."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stankowicz|Jackson|1996|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; MOBA's accompanying caption introduces questions and observations: "Can the swirling steam melt away the huge weight of George's corporate responsibilities? This pointillist piece is curious for meticulous attention to fine detail, such as the stitching around the edge of the towel, in contrast to the almost careless disregard for the subject's feet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-2.html Portraiture #2 Sunday on the Pot With George] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226050142/http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/portraiture-2.html |date=2009-02-26 }}.

===''Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt''===
In contrast to the pointillist impressionism of ''George'', the museum also features a "fine example of labor-intensive pointlessism",&lt;ref name="newman"/&gt; according to MOBA staff. Mari Newman's ''Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt'' (tempera and acrylic paint on canvas; donated by the artist), inspired this description by MOBA: "We can only wonder what possesses an artist to portray a dog juggling bones while wearing a hula skirt."&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;"[http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/recent06.php Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502115700/http://www.museumofbadart.org/collection/recent06.php |date=2009-05-02 }}".

Newman, a professional artist from Minneapolis, responded to the curators' cogitation by describing how the image came into being. She bought used canvases while a poor art student, and was unsure how to use a canvas with these dimensions. Inspired by a cartoon of a [[dachshund]], she chose that as a subject, but was unhappy with the effect until she added a [[grass skirt|hula skirt]] she had seen in a magazine, and colored dog bones she spied in a pet store. Newman wrote to them, saying "I almost threw it out until I heard of MOBA. After many years of slashing rejected work, now I wish I had saved them all for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frank|Sacco|2008|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motifs and interpretations===
Travel writer Cash Peters identifies six characteristics common to many of the museum's artworks. The first is that MOBA artists are unable to render hands or feet, and mask them by extending figures' arms off the canvas, hiding them with long sleeves, or placing shoes on feet in inappropriate scenarios. Second, Peters compared artists [[Rembrandt]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]], masters of landscapes, who "could probably paint with their eyes shut" to MOBA artists who apparently did paint with their eyes shut, as skies are often painted in any color but blue, [[flora]] are created without reference to any existing plant organisms, and [[fauna]] appear so small in the background it is impossible to discern what kind of animals they are. Third, MOBA artists apply [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] inconsistently, either from one painting to the next, or within a single work.  Peters's fourth observation concerns the difficulty MOBA artists seem to have in successfully rendering noses: he writes that a nose will be attempted so many times that the work takes on a third dimension as paint is reapplied over and over. Fifth, bad artists favor "mixed media": if in doubt, they glue feathers, glitter, or hair to their work. Lastly, Peters suggests that artists know their work is bad, but apparently feel the piece may be saved by including a monkey or a poodle in the composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peters|2003|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since late 2008, MOBA has been experimenting with allowing the public to title and caption some works. According to the curatorial staff, since some of the works are so puzzling, mere artistic interpretation is not sufficient: they must be "interpretated".&lt;ref name="saccoxiv"/&gt; The "Guest Interpretator's Collection" is an invitation for MOBA's visitors to include their thoughts on compelling artworks; a contest decides the best analysis and these interpretations are added as each contest ends.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.museumofbadart.org/interpretations/ The Guest Interpretator's Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208065825/http://museumofbadart.org/interpretations/ |date=2009-02-08 }}". Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A professor at [[Boston University]] offered his thoughts: "The location of the museum as much as its collection suggests a commitment to the abject and a belief in the power and force of culture's marginalized effects. I was also reminded that I need to pick up some toilet bowl cleaner on my way home!"&lt;ref name="english07"/&gt;

==Influence==
The Museum Of Bad Art has been mentioned in hundreds of international publications, as well as in Boston-area travel guides highlighting offbeat attractions. It has inspired similar collections or events in [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mopba.org/ Museum of Particularly Bad Art]. [[Museum of Particularly Bad Art]], 2009.

[[Commedia Beauregard]], a theatre company whose mission focuses on translation, was inspired by MOBA's mission to create their Master Works series of short play festivals.  The company commissioned six playwrights to write short plays based on MOBA artworks. ''Master Works: The MOBA Plays'' was originally performed in January and February 2009 in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. The plays were based on the MOBA pieces ''Mana Lisa'', ''Invasion of the Office Zombies'', ''My Left Foot'', ''Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt'', ''Gina's Demons'', and ''Lulli, Fowl and Gravestone''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcdailyplanet.net/article/2009/01/30/theater-master-works-blb-bad-art-good-plays.html&lt;/ref&gt;  After moving to [[Chicago]], the company again produced ''The MOBA Plays'' in March and April 2011, using three of the original plays and translating three new paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://centerstage.net/theatre/shows/10735.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314090442/http://centerstage.net/theatre/shows/10735.html |archivedate=2014-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to bad art===
[[File:MOBAfacade1.JPG|thumb|alt=Three buildings in a small New England square; in the center is a two-story theater with a marquee|The [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] Community Theater housed the first MOBA gallery in its basement.&lt;ref&gt;English, Bella.  "[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/01/13/museum-bad-art-loses-space-dedham-exhibit-its-stuff/rVNRyUctMdVXMAEVI57iZP/story.html Museum of Bad Art loses space in Dedham to exhibit its stuff]", ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' (Jan. 12, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Museum visitors can sign a guest book, and leave comments.  One Canadian visitor wrote:  "This collection is disturbing, yet I can't seem to look away...Just like a hideous car accident."  Another visitor warns: "Her nipples follow you around the room. Creepy!"&lt;ref name=Lowbrow /&gt;

Response to MOBA's opening and continued success is, for some, evocative of the way art is treated in society. MOBA works have been described as "unintentionally hilarious", similar to the atrocious films of [[Ed Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffwdweekly.com/Issues/1998/0917/art3.html "Exhibit Preview: The Museum of Bad Art"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720110249/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/Issues/1998/0917/art3.html |date=2008-07-20 }}. ''[[Fast Forward Weekly]]'', September 17, 1998 &lt;!--Retrieved on March 6, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors—and even MOBA staff—often laugh out loud at displays. In ''Gullible's Travels'', Cash Peters  contrasted this behavior with what is expected of patrons at galleries such as [[Southern California]]'s [[J. Paul Getty Museum|Getty Museum]]; though viewers might find the art at the Getty equally hilarious, were they to show it they would almost certainly be thrown out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peters|2003|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Louise Reilly Sacco participated in a panel discussion with authorities on art and architecture about standards of beauty and ugliness in art, published in ''Architecture Boston''. She remarked that teachers bring high school art students to MOBA, then to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA). Sacco observes, "Somehow MOBA frees kids to laugh and point, to have their own opinions and argue about things. Then they take the experience to the MFA, where they might otherwise feel intimidated... Maybe the ugly&amp;nbsp;... frees us."&lt;ref name="architecture"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.architects.org/emplibrary/AB_May_June_2006_RoundTableB.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109002239/http://www.architects.org/emplibrary/AB_May_June_2006_RoundTableB.pdf |archivedate=9 January 2011|title=Pretty Ugly |author=Architecture Boston |date=May 2006 |pages=18–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sacco believes that extreme ugliness is more striking than extreme beauty, and it forces people to think more deeply about what is wrong or misplaced. She connects this rigid judgment of what does not conform to beauty with intolerance for physical imperfections in people, noting that such rigidity sometimes causes parents to "fix" the perceived flaws in their children's faces to keep them from suffering later.&lt;ref name="architecture"/&gt;

Jason Kaufman, a [[Harvard]] professor who teaches the sociology of culture, wrote that MOBA is part of a social trend he calls "annoyism", where mass media venues promote performances and artists who mix the deliberately bad with the clever. The Museum Of Bad Art happens to embody this trend, and further illustrates its central aim to mock the judgment system by which people identify what is bad from what is not. For Kaufman, "The beauty of MOBA—though beauty is surely the wrong word—is the way it undermines aesthetic criteria from numerous angles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kaufman | first1 = J. | title = So bad it's good | doi = 10.1525/ctx.2007.6.4.81 | journal = Contexts | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 81–84| year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy Levin, describing how American history and culture have been shaped by small local museums, suggests that MOBA is a parody of art itself, and that MOBA's commentary, newsletter, website, and publications mock museums as authorities on what is good art.&lt;ref name="levin198"/&gt; The director of the Ellipse Arts Center, a gallery in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]], that hosted a traveling exhibition of MOBA works, was astonished to see people's exuberant laughter because no one visiting the Ellipse had ever responded to art this way. She observed, "If I didn't have a sign on the door, people might not think it's so bad. Who's to say what's bad and what's good?"&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;Lewis, Nicole. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-694807.html "For Badness' Sake"]. ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 8, 1998. D5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deborah Solomon]], in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', asserted that MOBA's success reflects a trend in modern art among artists and audiences. The arrival of [[abstraction]] and [[modern art]] in the early 20th century made art appreciation more esoteric and less accessible for the general community, showing that "the American public ... think[s] of museums as intimidating places ruled by a cadre of experts whose taste and rituals [seem] as mysterious as those of Byzantine priests."&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt; Bad art is in vogue, as a movement that rejects the anti-sentimentalism that marked earlier disdain for artists such as [[Norman Rockwell]] or [[Gustave Moreau]], according to Solomon.  Garen Daly, a MOBA fan on several Boston-area [[Arts council|art councils]], stated in 1995, "I go to a lot of openings, and sometimes they're pretty damn stuffy."&lt;ref name="hirsch"&gt;Hirsch, James "Gosh, That's Awful! It Would Look Great Hanging in a Museum—Painting Failures Are Displayed on Some Walls in Boston Dedication to 'Bad Art'." ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', July 12, 1995. A1&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does the Museum Of Bad Art offer different fare for the eyes, but instead of the wine and cheese that is provided for most museum and art gallery visitors, a MOBA show provides its patrons with [[Kool-Aid]], [[Fluffernutter]]s and [[cheese puffs]].&lt;ref name="lewis"/&gt;

===Use in academic research===
The Museum Of Bad Art has been used in academic studies as a standard of reference for the spectacularly awful. In one such study, published in ''[[Perspectives on Psychological Science#Journals|Perspectives on Psychological Science]]'', researchers tested the consistency of responses between people asked to make "gut" judgments versus those who gave conscious well-reasoned responses regarding the quality of various pieces of art.  The researchers showed respondents images from MOBA and New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA), and asked them to rate each painting on a scale with two ends representing "Very Attractive" and "Very Unattractive". The study found that those who reasoned in conscious thought were neither more accurate nor as consistent in their ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dijksterhuis | first1 = A. | last2 = Nordgren | first2 = L. F. | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-6916.2006.00007.x | title = A Theory of Unconscious Thought | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 95 | year = 2006 | pmid =  26151465| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Study participants identified and rated MoMA art higher quality, but those who used conscious reasoning did not find MoMA art more attractive than those who rated with "gut" judgments. Furthermore, the deliberators did not find MOBA art as unattractive as those with quicker response times. The study concluded that people who make quick judgments do so more consistently, with no significant change to accuracy.&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nordgren | first1 = L. F. | last2 = Dijksterhuis | first2 = A. | doi = 10.1086/596306 | title = The Devil is in the Deliberation: Thinking Too Much Reduces Preference Consistency | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 36 | pages = 39 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study that appeared in the ''[[British Psychological Society|British Journal of Psychology]]'', researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from [[ArtCyclopedia]] by artists such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]], and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''National Independent Contractors Association''', or NICA, is a [[United States]]-based organization that describes itself as an alliance of [[independent contractors]]. It was founded in 1995 as a corporation by Thomas McGrath, a former contractor in the [[transportation industry]]. According to NICA's website, its purpose is to provide services giving administrative support to independent contractors, but particularly for individuals who work as couriers or messengers (i.e., parcel or mail pickup and delivery, whether doing parcel pickup and delivery by bicycle or by automobile or motorcycle or other motorized vehicle or by serving as a walker).

==Insurance Fraud==
On May 6, 2006, Frank Green of the [[San Diego Union-Tribune]] reported that "the [[San Diego County District Attorney]]'s Office has issued a 50-count [[indictment]] against Thomas M. McGrath, founder and president of NICA Inc., and seven other company officials for allegedly filing [[false insurance claims]] worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. ... McGrath and the other NICA executives were [[arrest]]ed in Massachusetts on Wednesday." A year later, "Thomas McGrath, Dan Curran and David Kenyon were sentenced to 1 day in jail, 3 years [[probation]], and ordered to pay $350,000 in [[restitution]], and $14,000 [[Criminal investigation|investigative]] costs," according to a [[California Department of Insurance]] annual report. "The eight were charged with one count of [[Conspiracy to commit fraud|conspiracy to commit premium fraud]], six counts of premium [[fraud]], and 43 counts of filing false injury [[insurance claim|claims]] in a scheme that totaled more than $600,000 in losses," said the report.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4495">The '''Professional Science Master’s''' (PSM) Degree is a graduate degree designed to allow students to pursue advanced training in science or mathematics while simultaneously developing workplace skills.  PSM programs are interdisciplinary in nature, preparing students for fields such as [[forensic science]], [[computational chemistry]], [[applied mathematics]] and [[bioinformatics]]. PSM degrees can be completed in sixteen months to two years of full-time study including an internship.

==History==

Recognizing that traditional graduate-level science training may not be suitable for non-academic careers, the [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]], in 1997, began to support master’s-level degree programs designed to provide science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ("STEM") students with a pathway into science-based careers.&lt;ref name=Sloan2008&gt;Alfred P. Sloan Foundation [Sloan], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; These Professional Science Master’s degrees combine a science or mathematics curriculum with a professional component designed to provide graduates with the necessary skills for a career in business, government, or nonprofit agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Simms, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally funding fourteen campuses, the Sloan Foundation expanded its support directly or indirectly to over fifty institutions, collectively offering over 100 different PSM programs.&lt;ref name=Sloan2008/&gt; As of 2017, there are 356 PSM programs at over 165 institutions. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.professionalsciencemasters.org/program-locator&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2005, the Foundation funded the Council of Graduate Schools to be an “institutional base for PSM growth, with the goal of making the degree a normal, recognized, widely accepted academic offering”.&lt;ref name=Sloan2008/&gt; In furtherance of this objective, the Sloan Foundation also provided support to found the National Professional Science Master’s Association, a professional organization of PSM directors and alumni intended to “provide a collective voice for PSM degree programs”.&lt;ref&gt;National Professional Science Master’s Association, 2010, para. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Congress passed the [[America COMPETES Act]] which placed special emphasis on improving America’s economic competitiveness by strengthening STEM education. The COMPETES Act specifically mentioned the importance of the PSM degree to the nation’s overall competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;CGS, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a 2008 report issued by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] of the National Academies urged the continued expansion of the PSM degree. In 2009, the [[National Science Foundation]], under the auspices of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]], facilitated funding of twenty-two different PSM programs by appropriating funds for a Science Master’s program.

'''Sir Raymond John Avery''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|GNZM}} (born 1947&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/nights/audio/2451244/ray-avery Ray Avery]". Radio New Zealand. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a pharmaceutical scientist, inventor, author and [[social entrepreneurship|social entrepreneur]] in [[Mount Eden]], [[Auckland]], New Zealand.

==Personal life==
Avery was born in [[Kent]], England.&lt;ref name=lessons&gt;{{cite news |title=Lessons from mean streets of London |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10890968 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=17 June 2013 |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending his childhood in orphanages and foster homes, he developed an interest in science at the age of 14 while living [[Homelessness|rough]] in London and finding warmth in public libraries.&lt;ref name=nzawards&gt;[http://www.nzawards.org.nz/AwardRecipients/NewZealanderbroftheYear/tabid/36008/Default.aspx New Zealander of the Year Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223212319/http://www.nzawards.org.nz/AwardRecipients/NewZealanderbroftheYear/tabid/36008/Default.aspx |date=23 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He now mentors young people, speaking regularly at schools and universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnz.co.nz/good-morning/inspiring-kiwis-ray-avery-3379511 Inspiring Kiwis: Ray Avery]. [[Television New Zealand]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was later educated at [[Wye College]], a tertiary agricultural college in Kent.&lt;ref name=determination/&gt;

He settled in New Zealand in 1973 and became a New Zealand citizen within nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Great end to glorious Christmas |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10697215 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=31 December 2010 |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Avery published his autobiography ''Rebel with a Cause'', which charts his life from childhood in English orphanages and foster homes to knighthood.&lt;ref name=lessons/&gt;&lt;ref name=determination&gt;"[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU1007/S00410/one-kiwis-determination-to-make-a-difference.htm One Kiwi's determination to make a difference]".

==Career==
After graduating, Avery worked as an analyst in laboratories, in which he eventually took a shareholding.&lt;ref name=determination/&gt; After leaving Britain and settling in New Zealand, he was a founding member of the Department of Clinical Pharmacology at the [[University of Auckland School of Medicine]]. He was then the technical director of [[Douglas Pharmaceuticals]], where he developed and commercialised pharmaceutical and nutritional products.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite news |title=NZ man aids millions with 15c water drip invention |first=Simon |last=Collins |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/poverty/news/article.cfm?c_id=286&amp;objectid=8501056 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=1 December 2004 |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Technical Director of the [[Fred Hollows Foundation]], Avery designed and commissioned two state of the art [[intraocular lens]] manufacturing facilities in [[Asmara, Eritrea]] and [[Kathmandu, Nepal]], and developed novel low cost lens manufacturing technologies, systems, and global distribution networks. The Fred Hollows Foundation laboratories now provide 13% of the world market for intraocular lenses and use technology invented and gifted by Avery.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.committeeforauckland.co.nz/component/content/article/8-news-and-publications/200-no-respect-for-the-status-quo No respect for the status quo]". Committee for Auckland.&lt;/ref&gt; The mass introduction of regulatory-approved low-cost high-quality Fred Hollows lenses collapsed the global price of lenses, making modern [[cataract surgery]] accessible to the world's poorest.

In 2003, Avery founded the international development organisation [[Medicine Mondiale]] dedicated to making quality healthcare and equipment accessible to even the poorest developing nations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.medicinemondiale.org/about-us.html About Medicine Mondiale]". Medicine Mondiale.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine Mondiale==

'''Medicine Mondiale''' is an independent development agency headed by Ray Avery focused on improving life for the world's poor by developing products and technologies that have applications in both the developing and developed world markets.

== Projects ==

=== Intraocular lenses ===

Between 1993 and 1997 Ray Avery designed and commissioned two state-of-the-art [[intraocular lens]] laboratories in [[Eritrea]] and in [[Nepal]]. Together these labs now supply 10% of the world market for intraocular lenses and together with the efforts of other generic lens manufacturers have collapsed the price of lenses from over US$300 in 1992 to around US$6 today.  As a result, [[cataract]] surgery is now available to the very poorest around the world.

=== Acuset IV flow controller ===

The Acuset is a small device designed to control the flow of drugs through an [[intravenous therapy|intravenous (IV) drip]]. Unlike roller-clamp device still commonly used in the developing world, the Acuset is intuitive to use, even by untrained operators.  It allows fine control and precision of flow rates, eliminating the accidental harm, and in some cases death, caused by incorrect drug doses.&lt;ref name="Collins"/&gt; In 2008 the Acuset was a finalist in the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi World Changing Ideas Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://saatchi.com/en-us/news/world_changing_ideas_award_finalists_announced/ |title=World Changing Ideas award finalists announced |date=22 January 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]] |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infant nutrition ===

Medicine Mondiale has developed a range of nutritional productions for the treatment of protein-energy [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref name=Maternova&gt;{{cite web |url= http://maternova.org/health-innovations/proteinforte-predigested-protein-formulations |title=Proteinforte predigested protein formulations |date=6 August 2014 |publisher=Maternova |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are designed to combat acute [[diarrhoea]], which is the leading cause of death in infants under two years of age in the developing world.&lt;ref name="Infant nutrition"/&gt;

=== Infant incubator ===

The Lifepod infant incubator is a low cost but high end [[Incubator (neonatal)|incubator]] invented by Sir Ray Avery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hgfoundation.co.nz/Who+We+Support/Medical+Research++Innovation/Medicine+Mondiale.html |title=Medicine Mondiale |publisher=Hugh Green Foundation |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incubator is designed around performance, ease of use and simple maintenance in challenging conditions, such as in poorly resourced healthcare facilities with inconsistent power and water supplies.

Much of the incubator's features have been designed in response to shortcomings in many current incubator designs, which are not always effective or practical in challenging conditions.

By combining an innovative microbial filtration system, as well as robust electronics and mechanisms, Medicine Mondiale intend for the Liferaft infant incubator to be a 'plug and play' solution for neonatal healthcare facilities, requiring little or no maintenance.&lt;ref name="Infant incubator"/&gt;

==Books==
Avery has published two books: the best-selling Autobiography “Rebel with a Cause” &lt;ref&gt;"[http://penguin.co.nz/books/rebel-with-a-cause-9781869793913 Rebel with a Cause]" Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt; charting his life from street kid to Knighthood and “The Power of Us” &lt;ref&gt;"[http://beattiesbookblog.blogspot.co.nz/2012/11/the-power-of-us.html The Power of Us] Beattie's Book Blog&lt;/ref&gt; celebrating New Zealanders who dare to dream.

Irani|publisher=[[NNDB]]|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the former chairman and [[chief executive officer]] of [[Occidental Petroleum]].  He has worked at Occidental Petroleum for over 20 years, serving as a director since 1984, [[chief operating officer]] (president) from 1984 to 1990, and chairman and chief executive officer from 1990.  During his early years, he worked with notable Occidental CEO [[Armand Hammer]], who at age 91, named Irani his successor in February 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lev, [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30612FA34580C758DDDAB0894D8494D81&amp;showabstract=1 Hammer, 91, Gets an Heir At Occidental], ''The New York Times'', February 16, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Forbes.com, his five-year total compensation between 2001 and 2005 was $127,447,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/static/pvp2005/LIRWJ7X.html Executive Pay: Ray R. Irani], Forbes.com, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, after a rise in oil prices, Irani earned a total of $460 million.&lt;ref name="LAT040707"&gt;Elizabeth Douglass, [http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-irani7apr07,1,1196907.story Occidental CEO's 2006 paycheck: $560 million], ''Los Angeles Times'', April 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Irani was born in [[Lebanon]] and is of Palestinian origin. He received a [[bachelor of science]] degree in chemistry at the [[American University of Beirut]] in 1953.  He moved in the same year to [[Los Angeles, California]], and at age 18, began graduate studies in physical chemistry at the [[University of Southern California]]. He received his [[PhD]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="USC01"&gt;Eva Emerson, [http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/news/february_2007/irani.html Life Sciences Building Named in Honor of Alumnus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219013558/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/news/february_2007/irani.html |date=2007-02-19 }}, USC College News, February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  He subsequently worked as a researcher for the [[Monsanto Company]] until 1967 and joined the Shamrock Corporation. Prior to working for Occidental, he was president and chief operating officer of [[Olin Corporation]], a chemicals and metals company.

Irani is an honorary fellow of the [[American Institute of Chemists]] and is a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]. He is currently a trustee of USC and co-chair of the board of Trustees of the American University of Beirut. USC named a primary life sciences building as Ray R. Irani Hall on February 9, 2007.&lt;ref name="USC01"/&gt;
In February 2012, Irani, was elected as a member of the National Academy of Engineering. He was recognized "for leadership in the petrochemical industry and processes for applications of particulate systems." This is considered the highest honor in engineering in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aub.edu.lb/news/2012/Pages/irani-nae.aspx |title=AUB trustee and alum Ray Irani elected to prestigious US engineering academy |date=2012-02-24 |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career at Occidental==
Irani was brought to Occidental in 1983 to help its struggling chemicals division, and soon was promoted to president, replacing a series of presidents fired by Hammer.&lt;ref&gt;John Evan Frook, [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-9111635.html New heir apparent at Occidental doesn't pacify unhappy shareholders, analysts say], Los Angeles Business Journal, February 4, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1988, the media reported that Irani and his team were running the day-to-day operations of the company on behalf of the then 90-year-old Hammer.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Ramirez, "Hammer Hits 90! Oxy Grows Up Too," ''Fortune'', November 7, 1988, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Irani was awarded options worth $392 million.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Irani made news in 2007, when it was revealed that his total compensation for the 2006 year topped $450 million. His base salary was $1.3 million.  Occidental justified the compensation by pointing to the stock price, which had risen from $9 a share when Irani succeeded Hammer to $48.60 at the end of 2006, and to the company's market capitalization, which grew from $32.1 billion at the end of 2005 to $42.5 billion at the end of 2006.&lt;ref name="LAT040707"/&gt; His compensation in 2009 totaled $31.4 million, including $1,170,000 in salary and $24,758,827 in stock.  According to the Associated Press, within the last decade, Irani has received $857 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2010/08/03/is-occidentals-irani-worth-his-big-pay-check/ | accessdate = 2011-10-04 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Michael | last=Corkery | title=Is Occidental's Irani Worth His Big Pay Check? | date=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Irani put funds into an overseas tax shelter arranged by Deutsche Bank AG that the IRS later deemed an illegal [[tax avoidance]] scheme.  The Occidental Chairman opposed the U.S. Department of Justice subpoena of Deutsche Bank AG records as part of an investigation of myCFO Inc. His appeal was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2006.  Occidental's Board of Directors took no action against Irani despite the IRS ruling. An Occidental spokesman said that Irani's participation in the tax avoidance scheme was a personal matter and was not a violation of the company's code of conduct policy.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Waldman [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aQgudxxo2XFQ Ray Irani Making $59 Millions As Americans Deplore Executive Pay March 25, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Irani was awarded a $900,000 cash bonus by the Occidental board of directors for exceptional performance in implementing a cost-cutting initiative (including reduction in force job terminations) in anticipation of a "world-wide economic deterioration."  This was awarded on a discretionary basis by the Occidental compensation committee and not by any company performance metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.thecorporatelibrary.com |title=The Corporate Library |website=thecorporatelibrary.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917020547/http://thecorporatelibrary.com/ |archivedate=2011-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chazen collected $38,080,344 and Irani $76,107,010 in fiscal year 2010, nearly doubling his 2009 compensation despite shareholder outrage over the Occidental board of directors executive pay policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/ViewNews.aspx?id=22515|title=Woman tops list of highest-paid general counsels |accessdate=2011-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401070457/http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/ViewNews.aspx?id=22515 |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=293288&amp;ticker= Executive Profile September 08, 2011 {{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irani retired as CEO on May 10, 2011 after the California State Teachers' Retirement System and Relational Investors, two major institutional Occidental Investors, objected to the company's compensation policies and announced plans to replace long-term board members who were described as "ossified" in a letter written in protest of Irani's salary.  They also termed Irani's salary a "corporate giveaway program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/tag/relational-investors/|title=Relational Investors - DealBook - The New York Times|publisher= dealbook.nytimes.com |accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irani's salary was considered excessive and not truly performance based for decades by a number of corporate governance authorities who noted that Irani's compensation had exceeded that of the head of energy giant ExxonMobil, Rex Tillerson, who leads a company that has a market cap that is five times larger than Occidental Petroleum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/03/business/la-fi-oxy-calstrs-20100803|title=CalSTRS seeks to unseat 4 Oxy directors over executive pay|first=Marc|last=Lifsher|date=3 August 2010|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, former CFO and later President [[Stephen Chazen]] was named CEO of Occidental to replace Irani,&lt;ref name="lamag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/well-paid/|title=Well Paid - Los Angeles Magazine|date=2 December 2010|publisher=lamag.com|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-10-14/occidental-s-irani-highest-paid-oil-chief-executive-to-step-down-in-may|title=Occidental's Irani, Highest-Paid Oil CEO, to Retire|first=Joe|last=Carroll|date=14 October 2010|publisher=bloomberg.com|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-oxy-petes-highly-paid-ceo-irani-to-step-down-2010oct14-story.html|title=Oxy Pete's highly paid CEO Irani to step down|first=Associated|last=Press|publisher=sandiegouniontribune.com|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who planned to stay on as executive Chairman until 2014.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==KB Home backdating scandal==
Irani was a [[KB Home]] director for 15 years until November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/03/business/fi-briefs3.s4|title=Occidental's Irani leaves KB board|first1=From Times|last1=Staff|first2=Wire|last2=Reports|date=3 November 2007|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irani chaired the KB Home executive compensation committee during the time period when CEO [[Bruce Karatz]] lied about the company's practice of backdating options.  Karatz was subsequently indicted and convicted April 21, 2010 on Federal charges stemming from his actions and sanctioned by the SEC in a separate civil action.  The KB Home shareholders expressed their lack of confidence in the board and the compensation committee by a 19% opposition vote against Irani, who resigned from the KB Home board of directors after 15 years of service.  Occidental offered no explanation for his resignation in their proxy statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/hotproperty/archives/2009/03/former_kb_home_chief_indicted.html |archive-date= September 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915171415/http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/hotproperty/archives/2009/03/former_kb_home_chief_indicted.html|title=Former KB Home Chief Indicted| date=April 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.plansponsor.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=6442451733 |title=CalPERS to Withhold Director Votes on Backdating Concerns |accessdate=2011-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405081216/http://www.plansponsor.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=6442451733 |archive-date=2012-04-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.plansponsor.com/NewsStory.aspx?Id=6442451659 |title=KB Home Taps Independent Chairman in Post-Options Scandal Era |accessdate=2011-10-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405081224/http://www.plansponsor.com/NewsStory.aspx?Id=6442451659 |archive-date=2012-04-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zarrab’s chauffeur, Turgut Harpani, was arrested by the Turkish Customs Protection agency during his trip to Russia from Turkey in 2011 for carrying $150 millions in cash and was accused of conducting illegal money couriering, but he was then released by Turkish authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.milliyet.com.tr/gundes-in-esinin-soforu-kacakciliktan-gozaltinda-magazin-1377987/|title=Gündeş’in eşinin şoförü kaçakçılıktan gözaltında – Magazin Haberleri|website=milliyet.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.haberturk.com/yasam/haber/620972-soforunde-150-milyon-dolar|title=Şoföründe 150 milyon dolar!|website=haberturk.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Happani shared his own pictures on Facebook with suitcases full of money. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/operasyonu_baslatan_fotograf_balya_balya_dolar-1166808/|title=Operasyonu başlatan fotoğraf: Facebook'ta balya balya dolar! – Türkiye Haberleri – Radikal|first=|last=Radikal|website=radikal.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013 corruption scandal in Turkey==
{{main|2013 corruption scandal in Turkey}}
Zarrab, who has a business affiliation with the Iranian billionaire and [[business magnate]] [[Babak Zanjani]], was detained in Istanbul on 17 December 2013 due to his involvement with the sons of three ministers ([[Erdoğan Bayraktar]], [[Muammer Güler]] and [[Zafer Çağlayan]]) in the [[Government of Turkey|Turkish government]] and [[Egemen Bağış]], the former minister for EU Affairs and Turkey's chief negotiator in accession talks with the [[European Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/uc_bakana_rusvet_suclamasi-1166735 | title=Üç bakana rüşvet suçlaması | date=2013-12-18 | agency=Radikal | accessdate=2013-12-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219021159/http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/uc_bakana_rusvet_suclamasi-1166735# | archive-date=2013-12-19 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/yolsuzluk-ve-rusvet-sorusturmasinda-egemen-bagis-goruntuleri-de-cikti/246398 | title=Yolsuzluk ve rüşvet soruşturmasında Egemen Bağış görüntüleri de çıktı!

The investigation in Turkey revealed a system to help Iran bypass US sanctions against the country concerning the [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication|SWIFT]] payment system, in a scheme based on Turkish public bank [[Halkbank]], whereby money was transferred to front companies in [[China]] and Turkey, and [[gold]] bought with that money transferred to Iran via [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name=almonitor /&gt;

Then Interior Minister [[Muammer Güler]]’s son, Barış Güler, then Economy Minister [[Zafer Çağlayan|Zafer Çaglayan]]’s son, Kaan Çaglayan, and General Director of Halk Bank, Suleyman Arslan, were among the suspects including Reza Zarrab. They were arrested due to accusations of “bribery, professional misconduct, bid rigging, and smuggling”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/amp/2-bakan-oglu-ile-reza-zarrab-tutuklandi-25412674|title=2 Bakan oğlu ile Reza Zarrab tutuklandı – Son Dakika Haberler|website=www.hurriyet.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.hurriyet.com.tr/uc-bakanin-oglu-gozaltinda-25378920|title=Üç bakanın oğlu gözaltında|website=hurriyet.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erdogan backlashed and announced the investigation as a “judicial coup” against his government, and dismissed the prosecutors and police officials investigating the corruption scheme. After a 70-day detainment, Zarrab and the sons of cabinet members were released from jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/amp/reza-zarrab-ve-bakan-cocuklari-tahliye-edildi-25912625|title=Reza Zarrab ve Bakan çocukları tahliye edildi – Son Dakika Haberler|website=www.hurriyet.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erdogan received harsh criticism for obstructing and undermining justice and putting the judiciary under his executive authority. However, Erdogan announced that “justice has been served”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/amp/haber/siyaset/46077/Erdogan__Adalet_yerini_buldu.html|title=Erdoğan: Adalet yerini buldu|website=cumhuriyet.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egemen Bağış, then Minister of European Union Affairs, was dismissed after the corruption investigation. The Ministers of Interior Affairs, Economic Relations, and Environment and Urbanization – Muammer Güler, Zafer Çaglayan, and Erdoğan Bayraktar, respectively – had to resign from their positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/turkce/haberler/2014/12/141212_17_25_aralik_operasyonu_neler_oldu_10_soruda|title=10 soruda: 17–25 Aralık operasyonları|first=Mahmut Hamsici BBC|last=Türkçe|website=BBC Türkçe|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment charged high-ranked officials with significant accusations for receiving bribes: Zafer Caglayan received $52 million worth of bribes; Muammer Guler received $10 million worth of bribes; and Egemen Bağış received $1.5 million worth of bribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/amp/haber/turkiye/29997/Bagis__Caglayan_ve_Guler_kac_TL_rusvet_almakla_suclaniyor_.html|title=Bağış, Çağlayan ve Güler kaç TL rüşvet almakla suçlanıyor?|website=cumhuriyet.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The summary of proceedings were sent to the Turkish parliament for the vote on whether to lift ministers’ immunity and send them to court. However, given the strong majority of Erdoğan's ruling party (AKP), in January 2015 the parliament did not lift their immunity and swept away the significant investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/amp/haber/turkiye/191219/AKP_li_vekiller_4_eski_bakan_icin_vicdanlarini_sifirladilar.html|title=AKP'li vekiller 4 eski bakan için vicdanlarını sıfırladılar|website=cumhuriyet.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, Erdoğan announced that he initiated a “witch-hunt” against the Gulen movement for, as he alleged, being behind the corruption investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.t24.com.tr/amp/haber/erdogan-cadi-aviysa-biz-bu-cadi-avini-yapacagiz-bunu-da-bilin,258112|title=Erdoğan: Cadı avıysa, biz bu cadı avını yapacağız, bunu da bilin! – Gündem – T24|website=m.t24.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months after this announcement, the government arrested and detained police officials who conducted the corruption investigation. The prosecutors of the corruption investigation were also dismissed from their positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.haberturk.com/gundem/haber-amp/1273102-17-25-aralikin-fetocu-polislerine-operasyon|title=17–25 Aralık'ın FETÖ'cü polislerine operasyon – Gündem Haberleri|website=m.haberturk.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.mynet.com/1725-aralik-savcilarina-ihrac-guncel-1835160|title=1725 Aralık savcılarına ihraç|first=|last=Aljazeera|website=mynet.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Erdoğan has alleged that Zarrab conducted trade and business in aligned with Turkish interests, there have been several reports that suggest Zarrab’s illegal activities extensively harmed the Turkish economy.&lt;ref&gt;https://washingtonhatti.com/2017/09/13/zarrab-caglayan-gercekten-ulke-cikarina-mi-calisti-ust-d +uzey-yo neticid en-perde-arkasi/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest in the United States==
On 19 March 2016, Zarrab was arrested in [[Miami]], Florida, for conspiring to evade [[U.S. sanctions against Iran]] (by using his gold business to help Iran’s government evade the sanctions),&lt;ref name="The Economist" /&gt; [[money laundering]] and [[bank fraud]]. He was later indicted by a grand jury with charges that could bring up to 75 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/turkish-national-arrested-conspiring-evade-us-sanctions-against-iran-money-laundering-and|title=Turkish National Arrested for Conspiring to Evade U.S. Sanctions Against Iran, Money Laundering and Bank Fraud – OPA – Department of Justice|date=3 April 2016|website=archive.org|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403002020/https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/turkish-national-arrested-conspiring-evade-us-sanctions-against-iran-money-laundering-and|archivedate=3 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-zarrab/u-s-arrests-turkish-businessman-for-scheme-to-evade-iran-sanctions-idUSKCN0WN295|title=U.S. arrests Turkish businessman accused of evading Iran sanctions|date=21 March 2016|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2017|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District of New York]], led by [[Preet Bharara]],&lt;ref name="The Economist" /&gt; with assistance from a trial attorney of the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.&lt;ref name=dofj/&gt;

During the case, prosecutors have noted that Zarrab donated $4.5 million to a charity founded by [[Emine Erdoğan]], the wife of former prime minister and now president of Turkey [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].&lt;ref name="The Economist" /&gt; Prosecutors stated that Zarrab has "close ties" to Erdoğan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US prosecutors say businessman with 'close ties' to Turkey's Erdogan poses flight risk|url=http://www.dw.com/en/us-prosecutors-say-businessman-with-close-ties-to-turkeys-erdogan-poses-flight-risk/a-19283437|work=Deutsche Welle|date=26 May 2016|accessdate=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Zarrab's arrest, shares in [[Halk Bankası|Halkbank]], whose CEO was among those charged with taking bribes from Zarrab, had fallen by 20%.&lt;ref name="The Economist" /&gt; He has offered to pay $50 million to be granted a [[bail]].&lt;ref name="The Economist" /&gt; Bail has been denied.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In their brief against granting bail, prosecutors had argued that "if the defendant were able to reach Turkish soil, he could cause the highest levels of Turkish government to block his return to the United States."&lt;ref name="The Economist" /&gt;

In April 2017, media reported that negotiations involving the U.S. and Turkish governments were undergoing, to the effect that Zarrab would be extradited to Turkey while in return "Turkey would be much less resistant to the US’s missions in Syria, and primarily its support to the [[Democratic Union Party (Syria)|PYD]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rudy Giuliani, the jailed Turkish gold trader and the secret meeting with Erdogan |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/rudy-giuliani-the-jailed-turkish-gold-trader-and-the-secret-meeting-with-erdogan-1.3056527|publisher=The Irish Times|date=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most striking arguments in the indictment about Zarrab was that the Zarrab family sent a letter addressed to the president of Iran’s Central Bank and stated that he was ready for "Economic Jihad" against sanctions on Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.occrp.org/en/azerbaijanilaundromat/notorious-laundromats-used-in-irans-anti-sanction-economic-jihad|title=Notorious Laundromats Used in Iran’s Anti-Sanction ‘Economic Jihad’ – OCCRP|first=Paul Radu and Khadija|last=Ismayilova|website=occrp.org|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erdoğan's first comment on Zarrab’s arrest by the United States government was: “it was not a case that interests Turkey".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntv.com.tr/amp/turkiye/cumhurbaskani-erdogandan-riza-sarraf-aciklamasi,FGvKyWPapEWAqp0sNaMv4g|title=Cumhurbaşkanı Erdoğan'dan Rıza Sarraf açıklaması – NTV|website=www.ntv.com.tr|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is claimed that Erdoğan, on September 21, 2016 during a special meeting with then Vice President [[Joe Biden]], requested Zarrab's release from jail and prosecutor Bharara to be dismissed from his position. Also, it is claimed that Erdogan’s wife, [[Emine Erdoğan|Emine Erdogan]], did a similar request to Biden’s wife, [[Jill Biden]]. Furthermore, [[Bekir Bozdağ|Bekir Bozdag]], the Turkish Minister of Justice, visited the [[United States Attorney General]] [[Loretta Lynch|Loretta E. Lynch]] in October 2016 and stated how the Zarrab case was unfounded and that Zarrab should be released&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2017/10/16/tl-preet-bharara-trukey-trump-jake-tapper.cnn|title=Bharara on whether Turkey pushed for his ouster – CNN Video|website=cnn.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/opinions/global-opinions/the-man-at-the-crux-the-of-us-turkey-dispute-is-about-to-go-on-trial/2017/10/12/92c4c7a2-af96-11e7-be94-fabb0f1e9ffb_story.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time, it came out that Zarrab's attorneys, [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph W. Giuliani,]] a former New York City mayor, and [[Michael Mukasey|Michael B. Mukasey]], who served as attorney general in President George W. Bush’s administration, held a secret meeting with Erdoğan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/nyregion/rudy-giuliani-reza-zarrab-iran-sanctions-case.html?referer=https://www.google.com.ua/|title=Why Giuliani Held a Secret Meeting With Turkey’s Leader|website=mobile.nytimes.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halkbank Deputy Chief Executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla, who was in connection with Zarrab, was arrested in the United States in March 2017 with the charges of "conspiring to evade US sanctions against Iran and other offenses”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/turkish-banker-arrested-conspiring-evade-us-sanctions-against-iran-and-other-offenses|title=Turkish Banker Arrested For Conspiring To Evade U.S. Sanctions Against Iran And Other Offenses|website=www.justice.gov|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, it was announced in September 2017 that the US charged then Turkish Minister of Economic Affairs [[Zafer Çağlayan|Zafer Caglayan]] and former General Manager of Halk Bank Suleyman Aslan with offenses similar to Zarrab's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://washingtonhatti.com/2017/03/29/m-hakan-atilla-iddianamesinde-halkbanka-cok-agir-suclamalar-cikti/|title=M.Hakan Atilla Yakalama Kararında Halkbank'a Çok Ağır Suçlamalar Çıktı -|website=washingtonhatti.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-turkish-minister-economy-former-general-manager-turkish-government-owned-bank|title=Former Turkish Minister Of The Economy, Former General Manager Of Turkish Government-Owned Bank, And Two Other Individuals Charged With Conspiring To Evade U.S. Sanctions Against Iran And Other Offenses|website=www.justice.gov|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erdoğan appeared to be involved in the allegations about the US investigation. It was claimed that Erdogan's effort to save Zarrab was the fear that the inquiry had reached him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/world/europe/turkey-new-york-case.html|title=Why a New York Court Case Has Rattled Turkey’s President|first1=Patrick|last1=Kingsley|first2=Benjamin|last2=Weiser|date=14 October 2017|publisher=|accessdate=3 November 2017|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also alleged that Erdoğan wanted the US to release Zarrab in return for the detained US citizen pastor Andrew Brunson being held in a prison in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2017/07/07/why-trump-should-not-swap-prisoners-with-erdogan/|title=Opinion – Why Trump should not swap prisoners with Erdogan|website=Washington Post|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metin Topuz, a Turkish employee of the US Consulate General in Istanbul, was arrested on October 4, 2017 for espionage, being a member of crime network, and taking the evidences of the 2013 corruption investigation to the US. In the arrest warrant, it is emphasized that the main suspects of the December 17th corruption investigation were “foreign intelligence agencies and countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gazete.netgazete.com/gazeteler.php?id=20|title=Takvim Gazetesi|website=gazete.netgazete.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

As a response to the arrest, the US Embassy in Turkey announced on October 8, 2017, that "visa applications from Turkey were suspended."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberght.com/haberler/haber/2055744-abd-vizeleri-askiya-aldi|title=ABD Türkiye'den vize başvurularını askıya aldı – Bloomberg HT|website=bloomberght.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 16, 2017, ''NBC News,'' reported that Zarrab is now cooperating with federal prosecutors in a [[Money laundering|money-laundering]] case and that he was then out of jail, a move President Erdoğan had been desperately hoping to avoid&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/does-cooperating-witness-have-info-flynn-tie-turkey-n821341|title=Does cooperating witness have info on Flynn tie to Turkey?|work=NBC News|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is thought that Zarrab is [[Robert Mueller]]'s key to taking down Michael T. Flynn in the [[Special Counsel investigation (2017–present)|2017 Special Counsel Investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/did-the-feds-flip-turkish-businessman-reza-zarraband-could-he-bring-down-michael-flynn|title=Did the Feds Flip Turkish Businessman Reza Zarrab—and Could He Bring Down Michael Flynn?|last=Zavadski|first=Katie|date=2017-11-16|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/turkish-iranian-businessman-zarrab-gold-trade-erdogan-ties-iran-sanctions-case-reported-cooperating-us-prosecutors/28859053.html|title=Man Accused In U.S. Iran Sanctions Case Reported Working With Prosecutors|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Zarrab's release from detention to another facility inside the United States, the Turkish government expressed concern as to the status of Zarrab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/11/turkey-demands-info-reza-zarrab.html|title=Turkey demands news as Zarrab drops off radar|last=kjenson|date=2017-11-16|work=Al-Monitor|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en-us|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6vOW5patk?url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/11/turkey-demands-info-reza-zarrab.html|archivedate=2017-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, Zarrab reappeared in Manhattan court as a witness in the case against Atilla, having accepted a plea deal with federal prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gold-trader-zarrab-will-be-star-witness-iran-sanction-busting-n824351|title=Gold trader Zarrab will be star witness in Iran sanction-busting trial|publisher=NBC News|date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day after Zarrab testified in US Federal District Court, the Turkish government seized the assets of his and his family, including his wife Ebru Gündeş.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/world/europe/erdogan-turkey-iran-sanctions.html |title=Turkey Seizes Assets of Reza Zarrab, Witness in Sanctions-Evasion Case |author=Benjamin Weiser |date=1 December 2017 |website=[[NYTimes.com]] |access-date=4 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Zarrab is married to the Turkish singer [[Ebru Gündeş]]. They have one child together. Ebru Gündeş reportedly filed for divorce in September 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/son-dakika-haberi-ebru-gundes-ile-reza-zarrab-bosaniyor-40230898|title=Ebru Gündeş'ten 'boşanma' için ilk açıklama|language=Turkish|publisher=Hürriyet|date=25 September 2016|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the couple reconciled shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/bosanma-davasinda-surpriz-gelisme-40314705|title=Reza Zarrab ile Ebru Gündeş'in boşanma davasında sürpriz gelişme|language=Turkish|publisher=Hürriyet|date=4 August 2017|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Export award==
In June 2015, Zarrab received the Turkish Export Award jointly from the hands of [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Numan Kurtulmuş]], [[Ministry of Economy (Turkey)|Minister of Economy]] [[Nihat Zeybekçi]], and President of the Turkish Exporters Council Mehmet Büyükekşi, in a ceremony attended by President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mashreghnews.ir/fa/news/432684/%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D8%B1%DA%A9%DB%8C%D9%87-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%B1%D8%B6%D8%A7-%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%AC%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B2%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%B9%DA%A9%D8%B3 |title=دولت ترکیه به رضا ضراب جایزه داد +عکس|publisher=[[Mashregh]] |date= |accessdate=2015-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Reza Zarrab'a ihracat ödülü |trans-title=Export award for Reza Zarrab |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/reza-zarraba-ihracat-odulu-29344202 |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] |date=22 June 2015 |accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Richard Black was born on October 10, 1921, in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He enrolled at Syracuse University, but left the school to enlist in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He moved to Ohio after the war and opened an art studio in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; He also taught art at both the [[University of Dayton]] and [[Sinclair Community College]] on a part-time basis for years.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

===Career===
Black, who spent much of his career as a commercial artist, worked on projects for a number of companies, ranging from [[Frigidaire]] to [[Shell Oil]]. However, Black is best known for creating the widely recognized [[Mr. Clean]] commercial [[mascot]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] contacted Black during the 1950s.  He was tasked by P&amp;G with creating a new mascot for a forthcoming household cleaning product, to be called Mr. Clean. Executives at Procter &amp; Gamble described the new cleaner as being "like [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]" and envisioned the new product's mascot as a [[genie]] from a bottle.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

Procter &amp; Gamble wanted Black to design a bald man (or genie) with a nose ring.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Black created two versions of the genie, one with a nose ring and one without the ring.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Procter &amp; Gamble decided to use Black's image without the ring as Mr. Clean.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Mr. Clean products were first released to consumers in 1958.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; A television and radio ad campaign, utilizing Black's Mr. Clean mascot, accompanied the launch of the product line.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The company still uses the Mr. Clean character in its marketing, as of 2014.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

===Artist and painter===
In addition to his commercial work, Black was also a [[landscape artist]] and a [[portrait painter]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; In 1956, one of his landscape paintings, complete with depictions of  animals, was published in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; An official from the [[United States Department of the Interior]] liked the painting. The Interior Department soon contacted Black and asked him to illustrate a character to promote [[fire prevention|wildfire prevention]], [[Smokey Bear]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Black kept a life-sized Smokey The Bear statue on his front lawn at his home in Kettering.

===Death===
Black died at his home in [[Kettering, Ohio]], on March 30, 2014, at the age of 92.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; A member of the Fairmont Presbyterian Church, he was survived by his three sons, Richard, Christopher and Timothy, and seven grandchildren. His wife, Virginia Black, died in 2003.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

[[Tan Sri]] [[Doctor of Letters|Dr.]] '''Runme Shaw''', [[K.St.J]] ({{zh|s=邵仁枚|p=Shào Rénméi}}; 1 January 1901 – 2 March 1985) was the chairman and founder of the [[Shaw Organisation]] of [[Singapore]]. Runme Shaw and his brother, [[Run Run Shaw]], together known as the Shaw Brothers, were pioneers in the film and entertainment industry in [[Singapore]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]], and brought to life the [[movie industry]] in [[Asia]], especially the Southeast Asian region.

Runme Shaw was also a philanthropist who started the [[Shaw Foundation]], a charitable organisation. In addition, Runme was the chairman and president of several government boards, and a patron of many organisations. As a result, Runme won many local and foreign awards for his philanthropic work and contribution to the movie industry in Southeast Asia.

==Early life and education==
Runme Shaw was the third of six sons of Shanghainese textile merchant [[Shaw Yuh Hsuen]] (1867&amp;ndash;1920). A native of Zhenhai in China, Shaw Yuh Hsuen married Wang Shun Xiang (1871&amp;ndash;1939), and had a total of 10 children, three of whom died at an early age. He had his own import-export company, and was also the owner of an opera hall in which Runme Shaw's brother, [[Runje Shaw]], was its principal playwright and director. However, the opera business failed.

Runme was educated in traditional Shanghainese schools, learning [[Confucian classics]] and [[classical Chinese literature]].

==Business in Shanghai==
With the [[Chinese movie industry]] still in its infancy in the early 20th century, Runje Shaw saw the potential in [[Movie production|producing]] and distributing films in China. In 1925 he established [[Tianyi Film Company]] (also known as Unique) in Shanghai, and started off with producing [[silent movie]]s. Run Run and Runme (who was then working as a sales manager in his father's trading company) soon joined Runje in the venture.

Not satisfied with their domestic market, the Shaw brothers wanted to seek business opportunities elsewhere. Runme, who was the distribution manager, was given this task. Originally, Runme's destination was [[Indochina]] where he hoped to meet with the film distributors, but he was denied permission to land there. When the Shaw brothers saw great distribution potential in the Southeast Asian market where many Chinese immigrants lived, Runme chose Singapore as his base.

==Establishment of Shaw Organisation==
===''The Empire''===
Runme Shaw arrived in Singapore in mid-1920s to test the market for the Shaw brothers' films. He was later joined by Run Run and they together founded the Hai Seng Co (later Shaw Brothers [[Incorporation (business)|Pte Ltd]], the precursor of Shaw Organisation) in Singapore in 1927.

However, for new arrivals like Runme, finding distributors and exhibitors for their brand of silent movies proved a hurdle. As Shanghainese, Runme and Run Run found themselves locked out of the highly protected market by the dominant [[Chinese dialect|dialect]] factions &amp;ndash; [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]], [[Min Nan|Hokkien]] and [[Teochew people|Teochew]] &amp;ndash; who controlled the local film business. The film distributors believed that these businessmen imported films from China directly and showed them in their cinemas, and so very few wanted to release the Shaw's silent films. There was also an alliance between a major exhibition circuit run by Malayan cinema king [[Wang Yu Ting]] and Shanghai's Liuhe Film Company, a [[cartel]] that [[boycott]]ed Shaw films.

Undaunted by the opposition and [[prejudice]], Runme and Run Run persevered to carve out a [[market share]] for themselves. By 1927, they began operating their own cinema in [[Tanjong Pagar]] so as to show their films. The makeshift timber cinema, known as ''The Empire'', was leased to the Shaw brothers at a monthly rent of [[S$]]2,000, a large amount by today's value.

The first film shown at ''The Empire'' was a Chinese theatre play, called "Romance of the Opera", produced by Runme's own company. White cloth hung from the ceiling served as the [[projection screen]] for the cinema, where the audience sat on hard wooden benches and chairs. During [[Film screening|screening]], musicians, usually pianists, were hired to accompany the action, and this was meant more to mask the noise from [[Video projector|projectors]] and the audience than to provide the [[sound effect]]. Only two evening shows were screened per day. Despite this, the theatre attracted crowds with its offering of Chinese movies.

===Expansion into Malaya===
As profits grew, Runme ventured into Malaya in the 1920s and 1930s, with Run Run taking charge of business in Singapore. He travelled to small towns and major cities, including [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Penang]], and [[Ipoh]], to distribute and show his films. Ipoh was chosen as his base in Malaya, from where smaller towns could be explored for business potential.

Many of the small towns in Malaya did not have cinemas. One of the ways the Shaw brothers would test the market was to set their own temporary cinemas in open fields. Another means was to [[retrofit]] local Malay opera houses into cinemas, by entering into joint ventures with the local owners. Wherever their films proved very popular, the Shaw brothers would build a permanent theatre. In more rural areas, [[mobile cinema]]s were operated.

In setting up cinemas throughout Malaya, the Shaw brothers usually bought more land than was needed around the theatres. These were Runme's first real estate ventures, as he reasoned correctly that a successful cinema would benefit surrounding businesses thereby raising land value. With the growing chain of cinemas in Malaya, the Shaw brothers split their duties, with Runme eventually taking charge of northern Malaya while Run Run the southern half, which included Singapore.

===Expansion in the pre-war years===
Although the [[Great Depression]] of the late 1920s affected their business, it recovered sufficiently for the Shaw brothers to buy over more cinemas. By 1939, the Shaws operated a chain of 139 cinemas across Singapore, [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]] and Indochina. All the cinemas were managed under Malayan Theatres Limited, a subsidiary of Shaw Brothers Limited. In Singapore, the Shaw brothers expanded ''The Empire'' and moved to a brick building, the Alhambra, on [[Beach Road, Singapore|Beach Road]]. The Alhambra was the first Singapore cinema to have [[air conditioning]] and played films like [[Errol Flynn]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]''.

The Shaw brothers not only made their own movies, but also imported foreign ones which Runme brought in the early 1930s. Runme attributed the success of the Shaw brothers' film business to hard work and consumer foresight, knowing intuitively the public's taste in films and what appealed to them.

Besides the film industry, the Shaw brothers also expanded into the business of [[amusement park]]s, first in Singapore, then in Malaya. These were modelled after the ones in Shanghai where they were popular with the locals. They acquired and operated two of the three amusement parks in Singapore – [[New World Amusement Park]] at [[Jalan Besar]] and [[Great World Amusement Park]] at [[River Valley, Singapore|River Valley]] – from the mid-1930s to the 1980s. The Shaw brothers also started amusement parks in major cities in Malaya like Kuala Lumpur and Ipoh.

===Japanese Occupation===
In 1942, the beginning of the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore]] put an immediate stop to all the Shaw brothers' cinema and amusement park shows. Runme and Run Run had planned to leave for Australia with their families, but their plans were dashed when a quota based on age was enforced on young men leaving the country which Run Run did not qualify. Leaving their respective homes, the families of Runme and Run Run moved into the newly built Shaw villa at [[Queen Astrid Park]] in December 1941.

With the surrender of the [[British forces]] to the Japanese in 1942, the Shaw brothers and their families fled from their home at Queen Astrid. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] wanted Runme to produce and distribute propaganda films. Despite his attempts to hide, Runme was eventually captured by the Japanese. All Shaw cinemas were immediately seized by the Japanese propaganda body known as the ''Bunka Eiga Gekijio'' and the Shaw brothers interrogated. Runme was paid [[Banana money|$]]350 each month to run the films during [[World War II]], and he continued to supervise the operation of theatres in Singapore and Malaysia. The Shaw brothers were also allowed to reopen their amusement parks to the public.

After the Japanese occupation, the Shaw brothers returned to their movie business. With the impending invasion of Singapore, the Shaw brothers converted their assets into gold, jewellery and cash, and buried them in their back garden. After the war, Runme dug these up, and rebuilt his theatres and restarted his movie business.

===Post-war years===
The movie industry thrived after the end of World War II, and Runme saw his company's profits multiply. By 1965, the Shaw brothers owned 19 cinema halls in Singapore. There were also 30 independent halls in Singapore contracted to play only Shaw's distributed films. The Shaw brothers had the widest cinema network in Singapore. They also expanded rapidly into the region, and had a chain of more than 150 cinemas and 6 amusement parks in both Malaya and Singapore.

From the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, Runme became famous for bringing [[kung-fu]] films to cinemas in Singapore. By 1988, the company was reorganised under the [[Umbrella organization|umbrella]] of The Shaw Organisation Pte Ltd. Besides movies, the Shaw brothers had also diversified into various commercial and residential property developments, and have more than 15 subsidiaries operating office blocks, apartment buildings, shopping arcades, hotels, amusement centres and multiplexes.

==Other appointments==
Runme Shaw also served on the boards of several government bodies and corporations, besides his own Shaw Organisation group of companies.

Runme was the chairman of the [[Singapore Tourist Promotion Board]] from 1969 to 1976. During his tenure, Runme revamped the running of the board, added more staff and capital input, and opened tourist offices abroad in countries such as Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom and United States.

His success in turning the Board around prompted an offer for Runme to run as chairman for the [[Singapore Turf Club]] which he accepted. He was also a [[Board of directors|director]] at [[Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation|the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation]], [[Fraser and Neave]], presidents of [[St. John Ambulance Brigade]] and [[Alliance Francaise]], and served at the [[Bank of Singapore]], [[Bukit Timah Saddle Club]], [[National St. John Council]] and the [[Shangri-La Hotel Singapore]].

Runme was a patron of the [[National Kidney Foundation]], [[Metropolitan YMCA]], [[Singapore Association for Mental Health]], [[Singapore National Heart Association]], [[St. John's Council]], [[Society for Aid to the Paralysed]], [[Diabetic Society of Singapore]] and the [[Singapore Academy of Medicine]].

==Philanthropy==
Runme Shaw set up the philanthropic Shaw Foundation in 1958. The foundation's main purpose was to "return" his company's profits to society.

The Shaw Foundation donated millions of dollars to many charitable organisations and causes. Many of the beneficiaries were schools, such as [[Maris Stella High School]], [[Anglo-Chinese School]] and [[Saint Patrick's School, Singapore|St. Patrick's School]], where a part of its buildings are now named after the Shaw Foundation. As the chairman of the Singapore Turf Club for 19 years, Runme instituted the club's charitable use of funds for [[medical research]] and charitable purposes.

He was also involved in the [[St. John Ambulance in Singapore|St. John Ambulance]].

==Personal life==
Runme Shaw was married to Peggy, and had two sons (Vee King and Vee Fong) and four daughters (Doris, Vivien, Nora and Sylvia).

==Honours==
For his contributions to the society, Runme Shaw received numerous awards including the ''[[Panglima Mangku Negara]]'' by the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of Malaysia in 1965. This award gave him the title ''Tan Sri'', an honorific which is the second most senior in the system of [[Malay titles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/index.php/component/semakanlantikanskp/|title=Semakan Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his many honours, Runme Shaw also received a [[Pingat Jasa Gemilang|Meritorious Service Medal]] from the [[Singapore Government]] and a [[Doctor of Letters]] awarded by the [[National University of Singapore]].

==Death==
On 1 September 1982, in Singapore, Runme Shaw fell accidentally. Although he was able to walk home, he soon thereafter collapsed and went into a coma for two and a half years. On 2 March 1985, Runme Shaw died at the age of 84.

'''The Committee of 200''' is an invitation only [[membership organization]] of the world's most successful women [[entrepreneur]]s and corporate leaders. The Committee of 200's more than 450 members represent over 100 industries in the [[United States|U.S.]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Canada]] and [[Latin America]] and its members generate more than $200 billion in annual revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Russel Inducted to The Committee of 200|url=http://www.adeccousa.com/articles/Joyce-Russel-Inducted-to-the-Committee-of-200.html?id=118&amp;url=/pressroom/pressreleases/Archives/Forms/AllItems.aspx&amp;templateurl=/AboutUs/pressroom/Pages/Press-release.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1982, a handful of the most powerful [[women in business]] gathered in [[Los Angeles]]. Their immediate goal was to raise funds for The [[National Association of Women Business Owners]], a network dedicated to women entrepreneurs. Beyond raising $200,000 for NAWBO, the small group of women ultimately conceived a larger agenda: to create a national network that would capitalize on the experience of women at the top echelons of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NNBD|url=http://www.nndb.com/org/771/000128387/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==

The primary mission of C200 is success shared: to foster, celebrate and advance women's leadership in business. C200 members are uniquely connected to each other through the organization by the commonality of their careers. C200 offers current leaders access to unique programming plus a professional and personal network of their peers.

The committee takes part in reach out programs across the United States and in other select areas to MBA and college students as well as high school students. In the past they've visited colleges such as [[Stanford University]], [[Tel Aviv University]], [[University of California Los Angeles]], [[Duke University]], [[University of Chicago]], and [[London Business School]]. C200 has also visited with high schools such as [[The Ann Richards School for Young Women Leaders|The Ann Richards School]] and [[The Young Women's Leadership School of East Harlem]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.c200.org/C200/Our_Foundation/Campus_Reachouts/C200/Our_Foundation/Campus_Reachouts.aspx?hkey=9e6956be-602a-4b8a-b8c0-7044fd7e0473&lt;/ref&gt;

==C200 Foundation==

In 1987, C200 launched the C200 Foundation to provide women with tools to become successful entrepreneurs and corporate leaders. C200 co-sponsors one-day Reachouts for women MBA students. Seminars rotate among the nation’s top [[business school]]s, and at the seminar they award C200 Scholar Awards to enterprising first year women MBAs enrolled at the hosting school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=bizologie:  The Committee of 200|url=http://www.bizologie.com/c200-the-committee-of-200/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Two Point Hospital''''' is a 2018 business [[simulation game]] developed by [[Two Point Studios]] and published by [[Sega]] for [[Linux]], [[MacOS]], and [[Microsoft Windows]]. A [[spiritual successor]] to [[Bullfrog Productions]]' 1997 game ''[[Theme Hospital]]'', ''Two Point Hospital'' puts players in the role of a hospital administrator tasked with constructing and operating a hospital (and, by extension, an empire of hospitals in the fictional Two Point County, where the game is set) with the goal of curing patients of fictitious, comical ailments. The game was designed and developed by some of the creators of ''Theme Hospital'', including [[Mark Webley]] and [[Gary Carr (video game developer)|Gary Carr]]. They made use of their expertise in developing games such as ''Theme Hospital'' and ''[[Black &amp; White (video game)|Black &amp; White]]'' and wanted players to be confident in using the menus. The use of humour was deemed important because visiting real hospitals is unpopular.

''Two Point Hospital'' was released to a positive reception from critics, who acclaimed it for its style, humour and its faithfulness to ''Theme Hospital'''s aesthetics, but the game was criticised for its repetitiveness and lack of challenge.

After they left Bullfrog, Webley and Carr continued to discuss a follow-up to ''Theme Hospital''.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt; Their first attempt was ''ER Tycoon'', which was planned during Carr's time at Mucky Foot Productions but was cancelled because they could not find a publisher for the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_146/4839-Footprints |title=Footprints: The rise and fall of Mucky Foot |accessdate=10 February 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322084411/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_146/4839-Footprints |archivedate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mucky Foot closed in 2003 and Carr joined Lionhead; however, ongoing projects did not permit the continuation of the ''Theme'' concept. In 2015, Carr left Lionhead, which was closed by [[Microsoft Game Studios]] the following year. Webley had left the studio in 2013. They designed to found [[Two Point Studios]] to follow up on the ''Theme'' idea. Webley stated, "Gary and I have been talking about this project for a number of years and are really excited to be announcing Two Point Studios".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2018/01/16/theme-hospital-creators-announce-two-point-hospital-7234494/ |title=Theme Hospital creators announce Two Point Hospital |work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date=16 January 2018 |accessdate=17 January 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116191605/http://metro.co.uk/2018/01/16/theme-hospital-creators-announce-two-point-hospital-7234494/ |archivedate=16 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VentureBeat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EdgeIntPrev" /&gt; 

The timing of a ''Theme Hospital''-style game was also apt: Art director Mark Smart said making a hospital-simulation game "felt right" and that there was "a lot of love for Theme Hospital", while studio co-founder and technical director Ben Hymers said players had been wanting a sequel to ''Theme Hospital'' for years.&lt;ref name="GamesTMDev" /&gt; According to Webley and Carr, ''Two Point Hospital'' is a completely new game, rather than a reapplication of new assets to an existing game.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt; Carr said "I wanted to work on something like Theme Hospital again, appealing to a broader range of people".&lt;ref name="EdgeIntPrev" /&gt; The game was developed by envisioning fictional symptoms, often based on word play, and the means for the player to cure them, and determining which ones most attracted the attention of the development team.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt; Webley and Carr also wanted to develop a graphics style that would remain "future-proof" relative to changes in graphics rendering technology, and opted to use [[claymation]]-like effects, which they found made it easy for players to observe on-screen situations and would not become dated.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt;

Online features were an early target of the design of ''Two Point Hospital''; Webley and Carr recognised that players of management games tend to prefer single-player experiences. They designed the online elements of the game to be opt-in and to feature asynchronous gameplay elements, including multiplayer challenges. Players would be tasked with achieving objectives such as curing patients within a set number of months and their scores would be placed on online leaderboards. Players would be able to view their  progress compared to that of friends and other players during the challenge from these leaderboards, an approach Webley and Carr took from [[ghost (video gaming)|ghosts]] that are used in some arcade racing games.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt; ''Theme Hospital'' was recognised as one of the first games with support for [[mod (video gaming)|mods]]; Webley and Carr said ''Two Point Hospital'' would feature mod support, which will not be available at launch.&lt;ref name="pcgamer interview" /&gt;

To produce the game, Webley and Carr considered a few approaches to developing the game before signing with Sega. They originally considered [[crowdfunding]] the development through [[Kickstarter]]; they spoke to Playtonic Games, which had used Kickstarter to revive a 1990s property ''[[Banjo-Kazooie (series)|Banjo-Kazooie]]'' for ''[[Yooka-Laylee]]''. Shortly afterwards, however, they found video game development via Kickstarter was waning and decided this approach was too risky.&lt;ref name="gibiz interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EdgeIntPrev" /&gt; They also considered taking an [[early access]] approach.&lt;ref name="gibiz interview" /&gt; Hymers suggested they approach Sega as a publisher, which was fortuitous because Sega wanted to expand their profile with games similar to ''Theme Hospital''.&lt;ref name="gibiz interview" /&gt; While they were in negotiations with Sega, they selected a number of [[Lionhead Studios]] developers to help with ''Two Point Hospital''{{'}}s development, but Microsoft closed Lionhead in April 2016 before the Sega deal was complete and they had to quickly choose their staff on limited funds, building the team more quickly than they had planned.&lt;ref name="gibiz interview" /&gt;

According to Hymers, the developers used their experience in making games including ''Theme Hospital'', ''[[Populous (video game)|Populous]]'', and ''[[Black &amp; White (video game)|Black &amp; White]]'' to make ''Two Point Hospital'', which ''GamesTM'' described as "engrossing time-vacuum gameplay".&lt;ref name="GamesTMDev" /&gt; Smart said the team wanted the game to be accessible and not throw players in at the deep end, and that they wanted players to have confidence when examining the sub-menus and realising the level of strategy involved. Smart also said people do not like to visit hospitals and that using humour makes a difference. According to Smart, the ailments were concocted backwards; someone would decide that they wanted something and the team worked from that, or that they worked on them from "terrible puns".&lt;ref name="GamesTMDev" /&gt;

Hymers said queues of patients and their movement along corridors was difficult to produce because the game is in 3D, which raised questions about wall thickness and cell width. He compared these elements with their counterparts in ''Theme Hospital'' and believed it was much easier in that game, which is 2D with graphics made from [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], and that people were drawn in front of the walls. He also stated that making people avoid each other was tricky.&lt;ref name="GamesTMDev" /&gt; The game was developed using the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=“We want to build out a world of sim games” &lt;br&gt; How Two Point Hospital is a step toward bringing Bullfrog-era sim games back from the dead |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/01/16/theme-park-sequel-details/ |website=Rock Paper Shotgun |accessdate=18 July 2018 |date=16 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712122348/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/01/16/theme-park-sequel-details/ |archive-date=12 July 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later patch for the game featured character customisation, and a "[[copy and paste]]" rooms feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/535930/announcements/detail/2694733067859957921?utm|title=Coming This Week: Customisation Update!|publisher=[[Two Point Studios]]|website=[[Steam (software)|Steam]]|accessdate=3 October 2018|date=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Two Point Hospital'' received critical acclaim. Media review aggregation website [[Metacritic]] summarised the game as garnering "Generally favorable reviews".{{efn|name=mc}}&lt;ref name="metacritic" /&gt;

The game received praise for its nostalgia compared with that of ''Theme Hospital'' and its improvements over it. Rachel Weber of ''[[Games Radar]]'' was positive about the game's use of nostalgia, stating that the game had "taken the funny bones" from the original and transplanted them into ''Two Point Hospital''.&lt;ref name="GRadar" /&gt; Weber also praised other aspects of the game, calling it a "delight".&lt;ref name="GRadar" /&gt; Johnny Chiodini of ''[[EuroGamer]]'' stated that the game "stays true to the spirit of its sort-of predecessor" in ''Theme Hospital'', and that it was a "modernised successor".&lt;ref name="eurogamer review" /&gt; Chiodini also called the game a "welcome reinvention of a childhood classic".&lt;ref name="eurogamer review" /&gt; The game's similarity to ''Theme Hospital'' was also praised by ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'', who said it "extends beyond its predecessor both in terms of detail and scope" and that ''Theme Hospital'' had been replaced by "something better".&lt;ref name=Edge /&gt; ''[[GamesTM]]'' described ''Two Point Hospital'' as "Theme Hospital 2.0" and "A modern take on a beloved title", but also believed that it could have distanced itself from it more.&lt;ref name=GamesTMRev /&gt; Similar compliments about the game's similarities to ''Theme Hospital'' were given by [[Jeuxvideo.com]] and James Ide of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''.&lt;ref name=JVRev /&gt;&lt;ref name=MirrorRev /&gt; Even before release, Dominic Tarason of ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' described ''Two Point Hospital'' as "Theme Hospital 2 in all but name".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dominic Tarason |title=A longer peek behind the curtain at Two Point Hospital |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/02/26/a-longer-peek-behind-the-curtain-at-two-point-hospital/ |website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |accessdate=22 October 2018 |date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was shared by ''[[Bit-Tech]]''{{'}}s Rick Lane, who described ''Two Point Hospital'' as ''Theme Hospital''{{'}}s "sequel in all but name".&lt;ref name=BTRev /&gt; Jacob Bukacek of ''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' was of the opinion that ''Two Point Hospital'' used ''Theme Hospital'' as a base for improvement and remarked that it "isn’t Theme Hospital remade; It’s Theme Hospital improved".&lt;ref name=HCGRev /&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Ben Reeves thought that [[Two Point Studios]] had done "a remarkable job reviving Theme Hospital".&lt;ref name=gameinformer /&gt; ''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'' described ''Two Point Hospital'' as "the perfect cure" for "Bullfrog deficiency" and said it is precisely what ''Theme Hospital'' fans wanted it to be.&lt;ref name=GMRev /&gt;

Critics also praised the game's humorous content. UK newspaper ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' regarded the "amusing script and visual humour" of ''Two Point Hospital'' as one of its best features, calling it "endearing".&lt;ref name=MetroRev&gt;{{Cite web |title=Game review: Two Point Hospital creates a healthy obsession |author= |work=Metro |access-date=3 September 2018 |url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/31/two-point-hospital-review-healthy-obsession-7899066/ |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904224617/https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/31/two-point-hospital-review-healthy-obsession-7899066/ |archive-date=4 September 2018 |dead-url=no  |date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nic Rueben of ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' also commented on the game's humour, writing; "it’s not that any individual element is hilarious – it’s more of an infinite dads pulling infinite crackers sort of scenario. It just feels comfy, goofy and pleasant&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="RPS" /&gt; ''GamesTM'' believed the humour was taken from Bullfrog and praised its balance, saying the game is not "trying too hard" and keeps it light-hearted.&lt;ref name=GamesTMRev /&gt; Jason Coles of the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' also liked the game's "Good sense of humour" and abundance of puns.&lt;ref name=DailyStarRev /&gt; James Swinbanks of ''[[GameSpot]]'' echoed these sentiments by describing the game's "British" sense of humour as the game's "overwhelming charm",&lt;ref name=GSRev /&gt; as did Paul Tamburro of ''[[Game Revolution]]'' with his description of the game as "delightfully lighthearted",&lt;ref name=Gamerev /&gt; and ''[[GamesRadar+]]''{{'}}s Rachel Weber's concurrence with Swinbanks about the humour's Britishness.&lt;ref name=GRadar /&gt; ''[[Shacknews]]'''s Chris Jarrard compared the game's "outstanding" radio station to ''[[SimCity 2000]]''{{'}}s (which he described as "nonsensical") news system.&lt;ref name=SNRev /&gt;

Jose Cabrera of ''[[IGN|IGN Spain]]'' was positive about gameplay but critiqued its lack of challenge (an opinion shared by Tamburro&lt;ref name=Gamerev /&gt;).&lt;ref name="IGN Spain" /&gt; Cabrera referred to the game as being "fun and casual", but was well put together. Cabrera also called the game a "perfectly balanced simulation" that is based on the nostalgia of ''Theme Hospital''.&lt;ref name="IGN Spain" /&gt; TJ Hafer believed ''Two Point Hospital'' "revitalizes the business management genre".&lt;ref name=IGNRev /&gt; Fraser Brown of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' magazine was positive about the game's release, calling it a "brilliant management game regardless of nostalgia".&lt;ref name="PCGamer" /&gt; Brown, however, was critical of the game's balance, saying some "missions bleed together" and only a few levels are noticeably distinct.&lt;ref name="PCGamer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PCGamerUK"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[PC Gamer UK]]|author=Fraser Brown|title=Infectious|date=November 2018|pages=76-79|publisher=[[Future plc]]|ISSN=1470-1693|issue=323|location=Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other criticisms include the game basics being too similar to those of ''Theme Hospital'',&lt;ref name=MetroRev /&gt; repetition,&lt;ref name=MetroRev /&gt; the lack of an ability to copy rooms,&lt;ref name=Edge /&gt; and the lack of a sandbox mode.&lt;ref name=Gamerev /&gt;

'''Zest-O Corporation''' is a [[beverage]] company in the [[Philippines]]. It was founded in 1981 as SEMEXCO Marketing Corporation by businessman [[Alfredo Yao|Alfredo M. Yao]].

==History==
While touring Europe in 1979, Yao learned about the [[Doypack]] packaging format in one of the European trade exhibits he visited. He bought one machine and tried to market the Doypack packaging format to juice drink manufacturers in the Philippines. When no company took interest, he decided to market his own brand of fruit juice drink. He put up a company called SEMEXCO Marketing Corporation and launched Zest-O orange juice drink in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philstar.com/starweek-magazine/2015/07/19/1478358/alfredo-m.-yao-life-lived-zest&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansions==
To date, the company also exports mango purées to China, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Singapore, the United States, and Europe. Looking back, it started  with 20 employees in a small corner of a compound. Zest-O Corporation now has over 1,000 workers in various offices across the Philippines.

Early in 2010, the company ventured with [[Kalbe Farma|PT Kalbe Farma Tbk]] of Indonesia into the manufacture of a new line of [[energy drinks]], said to be the largest pharmaceutical industry category in Southeast Asia. The new venture recently introduced to the Philippines, Indonesian and New Zealand markets its new line of energy drink called “Extra Joss”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?id=28798&lt;/ref&gt;
