The '''Baldy Center for Law &amp; Social Policy''' is a research center at the [[University at Buffalo]] that advances interdisciplinary research on law, legal institutions and social policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/baldycenter/about.html|title=About Us - Baldy Center - University at Buffalo|website=www.buffalo.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Founded in 1978, the Baldy Center is housed within UB’s [[University at Buffalo Law School|School of Law]] but serves faculty with law and policy interests throughout the university. The Center was endowed by a bequest from Christopher Baldy, a prominent [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] attorney and UB School of Law graduate who died in 1959&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.buffalo.edu/news.host.html/content/shared/law/articles/introducing-sociology-to-law.detail.html|title=Baldy Center celebrates its 40th anniversary - University at Buffalo School of Law - University at Buffalo|website=www.law.buffalo.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Activities ==
The Baldy Center sponsors interdisciplinary research focusing on the intersection of law and social policy, awarding research grants annually to scholars across the university, especially in law, the humanities and social sciences. It also hosts and sponsors conferences that bring together researchers from across the world to discuss their Law and Society-related research. A list of grants awarded for research and conferences and their recipients [http://www.buffalo.edu/baldycenter/research/g-recipients.html is available] at the Center's website.

The Center’s intensive book manuscript workshops are organized around drafts of books about law, legal institutions or social policy by UB-affiliated scholars. The interdisciplinary discussions are designed to provide feedback to the authors from interested faculty and outside specialists.

The Baldy Center maintains cooperative ties to other interdisciplinary research centers and cosponsors a regional network of sociolegal scholars in New York and Canada. The Center additionally hosts distinguished scholars from around the world as visitors, speakers, consultants and conference participants.

The Center offers postdoctoral fellowships to budding scholars hoping to join the academy at American and global universities, along with research fellowships and senior fellowships. Research fellowships link law-and-policy scholars into the Baldy community and its resources, while senior fellowships are geared toward accomplished academics from other universities whose projects are closely related to the Baldy Center’s mission.

Through the Buffalo Legal Studies Research Paper Series, hosted and distributed by the Social Science Research Network, the Center provides an international audience for faculty and visiting scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/baldycenter.html|title=Baldy Center - University at Buffalo|website=www.buffalo.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
Christopher Baldy graduated from the Buffalo School of Law in 1910, in the days when UB was a private school. He died a bachelor and left most of his estate, initially valued at $1.4 million, to his three brothers, stipulating that when they died, the remainder would be a gift to UB.

A surrogate judge in 1973 approved using the Baldy funding to start a new program in law and social policy, a subject area favored by UB’s law dean, Red Schwartz, a sociologist and the first-ever non-interim dean of an American law school who was not a lawyer. Schwartz was a key figure in the Law and Society movement that emerged in the 1960s and sought to explore how the law actually interacted with society, as opposed to the more formalistic, theoretical and academic approach that permeated legal scholarship for much of the 20th century.

Five years later, under then-Dean Thomas Headrick, the program in law and social policy was formalized into the Baldy Center&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

From 1981 to 2009, the Center hosted the peer-reviewed academic journal Law &amp; Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=40 Years at the Baldy Center: A Law and Society Hub in Buffalo|last=Hammill|first=Luke|publisher=University at Buffalo|year=2018|isbn=978-0-578-40506-3|location=University at Buffalo Baldy Center for Law &amp; Social Policy|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

For much of its history, the Baldy Center’s activities were organized around working groups focused on specific research areas. The number of groups fluctuated over time and during the 1990s were concentrated into more formal Baldy Programs such as Environmental Law and Policy; Children, Families and the Law; Community and Difference; Law, Gender and Social Policy; Human Rights Law and Policy; and Regulation and Public Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=40 Years at the Baldy Center: A Law and Society Hub in Buffalo|last=Hammill|first=Luke|publisher=University at Buffalo|year=2018|isbn=978-0-578-40506-3|location=University at Buffalo Baldy Center for Law &amp; Social Policy|pages=61-82}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

After 2010, the Center retired the working groups model and instituted its fellowship program while continuing to focus on conferences, book manuscript workshops and supporting research&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=40 Years at the Baldy Center: A Law and Society Hub in Buffalo|last=Hammill|first=Luke|publisher=University at Buffalo|year=2018|isbn=978-0-578-40506-3|location=University at Buffalo Baldy Center for Law &amp; Social Policy|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Center for Jewish Art''' ('''CJA''') is a research institute at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], devoted to the documentation and research of Jewish visual culture. Established in 1979, it documented and researched objects of Jewish art in ca. 700 museums, libraries, private collections and synagogues in 41 countries. Today, the Center's archives and collections constitute the largest and most comprehensive body of information on Jewish art in existence. The CJA’s research and documentation is included in the Bezalel Narkiss Index of Jewish Art.

==History==
The Center for Jewish Art at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] was established in 1979 by Professor [[Bezalel Narkiss]], [[Israel Prize]] laureate, with an aim to document objects of Jewish art and produce a comprehensive iconographical index of Jewish subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cja.huji.ac.il/About_Us.html |title=About Us |publisher=Cja.huji.ac.il |date=2015-02-09 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center was an outcome of Narkiss’s iconographical research of medieval Hebrew illuminated manuscripts, which he initiated with Professor Gabrielle Sed-Rajna in 1974. The Index initially consisted of four sections: a Section of Hebrew Illuminated Manuscripts, of Sacred and Ritual Objects, of Ancient Jewish Art, and of Modern Jewish Art.

Professor [[Bezalel Narkiss]] headed the CJA until 1991. The next director, Professor Aliza Cohen-Mushlin, established a fifth section for Jewish Ritual Architecture and Funerary Art. Under her leadership the CJA undertook many research expeditions to post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe, in order to measure endangered synagogues and tombstones in regions, which were previously inaccessible to western scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://thesourceisrael.com/issue19/tour_article/ |title=Center for Jewish Art &amp;#124; The Source |website=Thesourceisrael.com |date=2006-02-22 |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, from 1994 CJA documented those synagogues in Germany which survived the Nazi regime and were not demolished in [[Kristallnacht]]. The documentation projects in Germany were done in cooperation with the Department of Architectural History at the Technical University in Braunschweig, headed by Professor Harmen H. Thies. In 1997 this cooperation was institutionalized as Bet Tfila Research Unit for Jewish Architecture in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bet-tfila.org/indexen.html |title=Bet Tfila – Forschungsstelle |website=Bet-tfila.org |date= |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

==Bezalel Narkiss Index of Jewish Art==
The Bezalel Narkiss Index of Jewish Art is a largest virtual Jewish museum in the word, which includes about 250,000 images from ca. 700 museums, libraries, private collections and synagogues in 41 countries, as well as architectural plans of ca. 1,500 synagogues documented in situ. The images are classified according to their iconographical subject, type of objects, origin, and date. The digitization of the Index is being undertaken in cooperation with the [[National Library of Israel]] and the Judaica Division of [[Harvard University Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/art/1.1641039 |title=המרכז לאמנות יהודית יזכה לתמיכה של 3 מיליון שקל - אמנות - הארץ |publisher=Haaretz.co.il |date=2012-02-14 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/digitallibrary/cja/Pages/default.aspx |title=The Center for Jewish Art Collection |publisher=Web.nli.org.il |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2015-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.slideshare.net/evaminerva/d1-vladimir-levincenterforjewish-artevaminerva2013 |title=D1 vladimir levin center for jewish art eva minerva 2013 |website=Slideshare.net |date= |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">'''Constitutive rhetoric''' is a theory of [[discourse]] devised by [[James Boyd White]] about the capacity of [[language]] or [[symbols]] to create a collective [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] for an [[audience]], especially by means of [[condensation symbols]], [[literature]], and [[narratives]].&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, Thomas, ed. “Constitutive Rhetoric” Encyclopedia of Rhetoric (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001), 616.&lt;/ref&gt; Such discourse often demands that action be taken to reinforce the identity and the beliefs of that identity. White explains that it denotes “the art of constituting character, community and culture in language.”&lt;ref&gt;James Boyd White, ''Heracles’ Bow'' (Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin, 1985), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of Constitutive Rhetorical Theory==

The constitutive model of [[rhetoric]] dates back to the ancient Greek [[Sophism|Sophists]], with theories that speech moved audiences to action based on a contingent, shared knowledge.  [[Kenneth Burke]] contributed to the theory of constitutive rhetoric by highlighting identification, rather than persuasion, as the major means by which language functioned. Burke contended that social identity is founded “spontaneously, intuitively, even unconsciously.”&lt;ref&gt;Charland, Maurice. “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the Peuple Québécois.” (The Quarterly Journal of Speech 73.2 1987), 133.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin Black (rhetorician)|Edwin Black's]] theory of the [[second persona]] also aided scholars in rhetoric to analyze the imagined shared values and beliefs between speaker and audience through [[textual analysis]]. Audience must adopt a particular [[ethos]] prior to being persuaded by constitutive rhetoric, thus the ethos of the subject of discourse can be critically studied and interpreted through a text.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these theorists all contributed to the theory of constitutive rhetoric, [[James Boyd White]] was the first to coin the term. In 1985, he explained that the term “constitutive rhetoric” described [[rhetoric]] that called a common, collective identity into existence. White wrote that persuasion and identification occur only when audiences already understand and relate to method and content. Thus, speech happens within [[culture]], and speakers adapt messages to reflect the ideas and views of a community. When speeches address a diverse crowd as though they are of one community, White describes this as “calling [identity] into being” through [[material culture|material]] [[identification (psychology)|identification]].

According to White, there are two methods of convincing an audience that they belong to an identity. The first is ''peithõ'', persuasion, and the second is deceitful manipulation, or ''dolos''. Using ''peithõ'', speakers convince audiences of shared identity openly and honestly. ''Dolos'' creates belonging through deceit.&lt;ref&gt;White, Heracles’ Bow, 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Maurice Charland further emphasized the importance of the [[narrative]] and [[Marxist theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 616.&lt;/ref&gt;  He observed, “While classical narratives have an ending, constitutive rhetorics leave the task of narrative closure to their constituted subjects”.&lt;ref&gt;Jasinski, James. “Narrative” Sourcebook on Rhetoric (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2001), 403.&lt;/ref&gt;  Charland’s theory draws from Burke and the philosopher [[Louis Althusser]]. Althusser explained [[Interpellation (philosophy)|interpellation]], or "hailing," as the social phenomenon of a mass audience having already been “recruited” by an [[ideology]]. Ideologies create subjects of discourse for persuasion by further discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, Louis. “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses.” The Anthropology of the State (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2006), 105.&lt;/ref&gt;
In other words, “the very existence of social subjects (who would become audience members) is already a rhetorical effect.” &lt;ref&gt;Charland, “Constitutive Rhetoric: The Case of the Peuple Québécois.”,1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political speeches, manifestos, and resistance movements participate in this type of discourse, to establish an identity and a call to action within that identity.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 617.&lt;/ref&gt;  A leader’s speech calling a “nation” to war establishes a national identity within the discourse or text. A feminist speaking on women’s right establishes the identity of the “woman”. An African-American protesting during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] established an “African-American” identity. Every audience member may take part in shared identity because of common symbolic resources, even as the text may especially [[Interpellation (philosophy)|interpellate]] a smaller sub-group of the [[audience]]. An identity must be established in contrast to another identity. This creates divisions between “us” and “them,” sometimes creating extreme divisions between different identifications.

In 2015, Halstrøm and Galle picked up on constitutive rhetoric within the field of design studies. They explained how it may provide useful concepts for analysing designed artefacts. Design may be said to aim at providing an audience with a subject position, which it is to confirm. Thus, it aims at persuading by seeking to constitute its audience.&lt;ref&gt;Halstrøm, P. L. &amp; P. Galle. “Design as co-evolution of problem, solution, and audience.” Artifact 3(4), (2015): 3.1-3.13. {{DOI|10.14434/artifact.v3i4.12815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Constitutive rhetoric and theories of logical persuasion (such as [[New Criticism]] or [[Neo-Aristotelianism]]) can be used together, but constitutive rhetoric presumes that belief and identity always precedes logical persuasion. Thus, constitutive rhetoric must address the previous identity and must either coincide with it, or change it.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 617.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Derrida]] criticized the paradox of constitutive rhetoric when he analyzed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. He explained that the men signing the Declaration claimed to be representatives of “the people,” but the people were not yet defined as a nation until that Declaration was signed. His criticism explains that an identity must be established before that identity exists in order for the speaker to represent the ideals of that identity, thus creating a paradoxical relationship in which only a third perspective can truly analyze the identity of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Sloane, “Constitutive Rhetoric”, 618.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cue notes.png|thumb|Cue in orchestral music]]

In [[musical notation]], a '''cue note''' is or '''cue notes''' are indications informing [[musician|players]], "of important passages being played by other instruments, [such as an] '''entrance''' after a long period of [[rest (music)|rest]]."&lt;ref name="McGrain"&gt;McGrain, Mark (1990). ''Music Notation'', p.183. Hal Leonard. {{ISBN|9781476867052}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A cue may also function as a guideline for another instrument for [[musical improvisation]] or if there are many bars rest to help the performer find where to come in.

"Cue notes may be given as guidance only, to assist a performer's entrance after numerous measures of rest....[Their size, and all elements associated with them] is somewhat smaller than normal note size, but still large enough to be legible (65-75% of normal note size)."&lt;ref&gt;Gerou, Tom &amp; Lusk, Linda (1996). ''Essential Dictionary of Music Notation'', p.119. Alfred Music Publishing. {{ISBN|9781457410710}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cued instrument is indicated with text and the cue notes are smaller than the rest. The [[stem (music)|stems]] of cue notes all go in the same direction and cue notes are [[transposing instrument|transposed]] into the key of the part entering.&lt;ref name="McGrain"/&gt;

== Other definitions ==

There are also passages in certain scores where there is an indication above a line of notes saying "cue notes" or simply "cue", but this indication does not have anything to do with the "cue notes" explained above. Opposed to these, these "cue notes" are more like alternative notes, which can either be played or not played, depending on the conductor's decision. This practice is particularly common in recordings of orchestral film music, where they often like to try out several orchestral colors and weightings in just one recording session and therefore use cued passages to try out other options.

'''Cyber risk quantification''' involves the application of risk quantification techniques to an organization's cybersecurity risk.  Cyber risk quantification is the process of evaluating the cyber risks that have been identified and then validating, measuring and analyzing the available cyber data using mathematical modeling techniques to accurately represent the organization's [[cybersecurity]] environment in a manner that can be used to make informed cybersecurity infrastructure investment and risk transfer decisions.  Cyber risk quantification is a supporting activity to cybersecurity risk management; cybersecurity risk management is a component of enterprise risk management and is especially important in organizations and enterprises that are highly dependent upon their [[information technology]] (IT) networks and systems for their business operations.

One method of quantifying cyber risk is the [[value-at-risk]] (VaR) method that is discussed at the January 2015 World Economic Forum meeting (see external reference below).  At this meeting, VaR was studied and researched and deemed to be a viable method of quantifying cyber risk.

A metric related to Cyber Risk Quantification that has been identified and cited{{who|date=January 2017}} is "Cyber Risk Reduction Return on Investment" or "CR3OI" as a metric that uses Cyber VaR and is an expression of the return on investment of a single or series of cyber investments.  See [[Cyber Risk Reduction Return on Investment]].

==Tools==
{{advert section|date=May 2017}}
Cyber risk quantification can be an automated or software supported process that lets the user create a model of the system architecture and then uses the built in mathematical modeling techniques in the software to quantify the cyber security risks.
 
* foreseeti offers a commercial Cyber Risk Quantification tool – securiCAD. This tool focuses on cyber risk quantification of IT infrastructures using a CAD-based approach where assets are automatically or manually placed on a drawing pane. By encapsulating complex attack trees within generalizable assets (like hosts, dataflows, firewalls, and IDS), securiCAD makes Cyber Risk Quantification accessible also for non-experts. By attaching an Attacker to different attack steps on available Assets, different scenarios can be simulated and analyzed. It is intended for company cyber security management, from CISO to security engineer to IT technician.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.foreseeti.com Cyber Threat Modeling and Risk Mgmt - securiCAD by foreseeti]&lt;/ref&gt; The further development of securiCAD is currently a part of the EU-funded project CyberWiz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberwiz.eu The CyberWiz Project Website]&lt;/ref&gt; An article (in German) about CyberWiz containing some insights in the functionality of securiCAD has been published in the expert portal "Informatik aktuell".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.informatik-aktuell.de/betrieb/sicherheit/cyberwiz-ein-eu-projekt-zum-schutz-kritischer-infrastrukturen.html/ CyberWiz - ein EU-Projekt zum schutz kritischer Infrastrukturen]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Denoising Algorithm based on Relevance network Topology''' (DART) is an unsupervised algorithm that estimates an activity score for a pathway in a gene expression matrix, following a denoising step.&lt;ref name="dart" /&gt; In DART, a weighted average is used where the weights reflect the degree of the nodes in the pruned network.&lt;ref name="dart" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiao|first=yan|author2=Katherine Lawler |title=DART: Denoising Algorithm based on Relevance network Topology improves molecular pathway activity inference|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|date=19 October 2011|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-12-403|volume=12|page=403|pmid=22011170|pmc=3228554}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The denoising step removes prior information that is inconsistent with a data set. This strategy substantially improves unsupervised predictions of pathway activity that are based on a prior model, which was learned from a different biological system or context.&lt;ref name="dart" /&gt;

Pre-existing methods such as gene set enrichment analysis method attempt to infer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Subramanian|first=Tamayo|author2=Mukherjee, Ebert BL |title=Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles|journal=PNAS|date=Sep 30, 2005|doi=10.1073/pnas.0506580102|pmid=16199517|pmc=1239896|volume=102|pages=15545–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did not construct a structured list of genes. SPIA (Signaling Pathway Impact analysis)&lt;ref name=naps&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tarca AL|first=Draghici|author2=Khatri P |author3=Hassan SS |title=A novel signaling pathway impact analysis|journal=Bioinformatics |year=2009 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btn577 |volume=25 |pages=75–82|pmc=2732297}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method that uses the phenotype information to evaluate the pathway activity between two phenotypes. However, it does not identify the pathway gene subset that could be used to differentiate individual samples.&lt;ref name= naps /&gt;
[[CORG]] is used to identify a relevant gene subset. It is a supervised method, which does not perform as well as DART in analyzing independent data set&lt;ref name="dart" /&gt;

Understanding molecular pathway activity is crucial for risk assessment, clinical diagnosis and treatment. [[Meta-analysis]] of complex genomic data is often associated with difficulties such as extracting useful information from big data, eliminating confounding factors and providing more sensible interpretation. 
Different approaches have been taken to highlight the identification of relevant pathway in order to provide better [[gene expression]] prediction.

== Method ==

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:DART method.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Strategy ==

#Build a network of all genes that are involved in the pathway
#Evaluate the consistency of the prior regulatory information 
#Remove inconsistent prior information-the denoising step
#Estimate pathway activity

Pearson correlations were first computed between regulatory genes at the level of transcription and a gene expression data set. The correlation coefficient then underwent a [[Fisher's transform]]: 
 
:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma_{ij}=\frac{1}{2} \log{\frac{1+c_{ij}}{1-c_{ij}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where c&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; is the correlation coefficient between gene i and j, and where γ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; is the variable that under the null hypothesis, its mean is zero and standard deviation 1/{{radic|n_s-3}}, where ns is the number of tumor samples. The threshold of p-value was set at 0.0001. Gene pairs with significant correlation will be considered relevant in the network. 
To predict the activity score in which genes that are nearby are also taken into consideration:

&lt;math&gt;
\vec S_{W\;AV}=\frac 1\sqrt{\sum_{i\in N}k_i^2}\sum_{i\in N}\sigma_ik_i\vec Z_i
&lt;/math&gt;
 
Where ki is the number of neighbors of gene i, zi is the normalized z-score and σi is a binary variable ( i.e 1 means upregulated upon activation and -1 means downregulated). This step is to estimate the activation level, in which sw AV is the activity score. A linear regression model was then applied to estimate the pathway activation levels. Thus, tij and pij denote the t-statistics and p-value associated with, whereas p&lt;0.05 indicates a significance.
To assess the consistency in a validation data set D, the performance measure Vij is denoted:

&lt;math&gt;
V_{ij}=\sum_{d\in D}\sigma_{ij}^{(d)}\left|t_{ij}^{(d)}\right|S\left(p_{ij}^{d}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
 
Where S is defined by

&lt;math&gt;
S(p_{ij})=
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; p_{ij}\le 0.05 \\
0 &amp; p_{ij}&gt;0.05
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
S is the threshold function of a given pair of pathways.
And where

&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{ij}^{(d)}=
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \mathrm{sign}\left(t_{ij}^{(train)}\right)=\mathrm{sign}\left(t_{ij}^{(d)}\right),\;d\in D \\
-1 &amp; \mathrm{sign}\left(t_{ij}^{(train)}\right)=-\mathrm{sign}\left(t_{ij}^{(d)}\right),\;d\in D
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

σ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; is the score that tells the directionality of a correlation, in which an opposite prediction will be panelized by given a value of -1. t&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;  is the t-statistics of interpathway correlation. 
The performance measure Vij accounts for the significance of correlation between pathways, the direction of correlation, and the weights in the magnitude of the correlation. 
A two-tailed paired Wilcoxon test is performed to compare the distribution under hypothesis. 
Advantages and limitation:
DART gives an improved performance and higher accuracy in inferring pathway activity from prior information of pathway databases. 
Pre-existed information and large database are needed in order for DART to run.In other words, DART requires well-established prior gene expression data to start with, and then it can proceed evaluation of consistency and denoise any irrelevant information.

== Application ==

DART is an algorithm that is applicable and used successfully in Cancer Genomics. The DART [[algorithm]] has been shown to be a strong method for estimating the pathway activity and perturbation signature activity in breast and lung cancer gene expression data sets.&lt;ref name="dart" /&gt;
Imaging traits such as [[mammography]] (Mammography is the process of using low-energy X-rays to examine the human breast tissue) plays an important role in cancer tumor diagnosis. Studies have shown that women with increased mammographic density have a higher risk of developing Breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li J|first=Eriksson L|author2=Humphreys K |author3=Czene K |title=Genetic variation in the estrogen metabolic pathway and mammographic density as an intermediate phenotype of breast cancer|journal=Breast Cancer Res|date=2010|doi=10.1186/bcr2488|volume=12|pages=R19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estrogen receptor alpha gene 1 encodes Estrogen Receptor-alpha, which is activated by estrogen. Polymorphisms in [[ESR1]] are associated with breast cancer risk through differences in different level of breast density. DART successfully predicted an inverse correlation between ESR1 signaling and MMD.
It can be used in simulated and real multidimensional cancer genomic data. It gives more reliable prediction about pathway activation, which would be helpful in association studies.

'''''Dictyostelium discoideum''''' is a species of soil-living [[Amoeboid|amoeba]] belonging to the phylum [[Amoebozoa]], infraphylum [[Mycetozoa]]. Commonly referred to as [[slime mold]], ''D. discoideum'' is a [[eukaryote]] that transitions from a collection of unicellular amoebae into a multicellular slug and then into a fruiting body within its lifetime. Its unique asexual lifecycle consists of four stages: vegetative, aggregation, migration, and culmination. The lifecycle of ''D. discoideum'' is relatively short, which allows for timely viewing of all stages. The cells involved in the lifecycle undergo movement, chemical signaling, and development, which are applicable to human cancer research. The simplicity of its lifecycle makes ''D. discoideum'' a valuable model organism to study genetic, cellular, and biochemical processes in other organisms.

==Natural habitat and diet==
In the wild, ''D. discoideum'' can be found in soil and moist leaf litter. Its primary diet consists of [[bacteria]], such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', found in the soil and decaying organic matter. [[Uninucleate]] [[amoebae]] of ''D. discoideum'' consume bacteria found in its natural habitat, which includes [[temperate deciduous forest|deciduous forest]] soil and decaying leaves.&lt;ref name="Eichinger L."&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eichinger L | year = 2003 | title = Crawling in to a new era – the ''Dictyostelium'' genome project | url = | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 9| pages = 1941–1946 | doi = 10.1093/emboj/cdg214 | pmid = 12727861 | last2 = Noegel | first2 = AA | pmc = 156086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle and reproduction==
The [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of ''D. discoideum'' begins as [[spore]]s are released from a mature [[sorocarp]] (fruiting body). Myxamoebae hatch from the spores under warm and moist conditions. During their vegetative stage, the myxamoebae divide by [[mitosis]] as they feed on bacteria.  The bacteria secrete [[folic acid]], attracting the myxamoebae. When the supply of bacteria is depleted, the myxamoebae enter the aggregation stage.

During aggregation, starvation initiates the creation of a biochemical machinery that includes [[glycoprotein]]s and [[adenylyl cyclase]].&lt;ref name="Gilbert S.F."&gt;Gilbert S.F. 2006. Developmental Biology. 8th ed. Sunderland (MA):Sinauer p. 36-39.&lt;/ref&gt; The glycoproteins allow for cell-cell [[adhesion]], and adenylyl cyclase creates [[cyclic AMP]]. Cyclic AMP is secreted by the amoebae to attract neighboring cells to a central location. As they move toward the signal, they bump into each other and stick together by the use of glycoprotein adhesion molecules.

The migration stage begins once the amoebae have formed a tight aggregate and the elongated mound of cells tip over to lie flat on the ground. The amoebae work together as a motile pseudoplasmodium, also known as a slug. The slug is about 2–4&amp;nbsp;mm long, composed of up to 100,000 cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cell|last = Cooper|first = Geoffrey M|publisher = [[Sinauer Associates]]|year = 2000|isbn = 0-87893-106-6|location = Sunderland, Massachusetts|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9917/|edition = 2nd|authorlink = Geoffrey M.

Developmental Biology: A guide for experimental study. 2nd ed. Sunderland (MA): Sinauer. p. 31-34. {{ISBN|0-87893-843-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of this sheath is left behind as a slimy trail as it moves toward attractants such as [[light]], [[heat]], and [[humidity]] in a forward-only direction.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  Cyclic AMP and a substance called [[differentiation-inducing factor]], help to form different cell types.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  The slug becomes differentiated into prestalk and prespore cells that move to the anterior and posterior ends, respectively. Once the slug has found a suitable environment, the anterior end of the slug forms the stalk of the fruiting body and the posterior end forms the spores of the fruiting body.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  Anterior-like cells, which have only been recently discovered, are also dispersed throughout the posterior region of the slug. These anterior-like cells form the very bottom of the fruiting body and the caps of the spores.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  After the slug settles into one spot, the posterior end spreads out with the anterior end raised in the air, forming what is called the "Mexican hat", and the culmination stage begins.

The prestalk cells and prespore cells switch positions in the culmination stage to form the mature fruiting body.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  The anterior end of the Mexican hat forms a cellulose tube, which allows the more posterior cells to move up the outside of the tube to the top, and the prestalk cells move down.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt; This rearrangement forms the stalk of the fruiting body made up of the cells from the anterior end of the slug, and the cells from the posterior end of the slug are on the top and now form the spores of the fruiting body.  At the end of this 8– to 10-hour process, the mature fruiting body is fully formed.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  This fruiting body is 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm tall and is now able to start the entire cycle over again by releasing the mature spores that become myxamoebae.

==Sexual reproduction==
In general, although ''D. discoideum'' generally reproduces [[asexual reproduction|asexually]], ''D. discoideum'' is still capable of [[sexual reproduction]] if certain conditions are met. ''D. discoideum'' has three different mating types and studies have identified the sex locus that specifies these three mating types. Type I strains are specified by the gene called MatA, Type II strains have three different genes: MatB (homologous to Mat A), Mat C, and Mat D, and Type III strains have Mat S and Mat T genes (which are homologous to Mat C and Mat D).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bloomfield|first=Gareth|last2=Skelton|first2=Jason|last3=Ivens|first3=Alasdair|last4=Tanaka|first4=Yoshimasa|last5=Kay|first5=Robert R.|date=2010-12-10|title=Sex Determination in the Social Amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6010/1533|journal=Science|language=en|volume=330|issue=6010|pages=1533–1536|doi=10.1126/science.1197423|issn=0036-8075|pmc=3648785|pmid=21148389}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sexes can only mate with the two different sexes and not with its own.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When incubated with their bacterial food supply, heterothallic or homothallic sexual development can occur, resulting in the formation of a diploid zygote.&lt;ref name="pmid21929567"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Day DH, Keszei A |title=Signalling and sex in the social amoebozoans |journal=Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=313–29 |date=May 2012  |pmid=21929567 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.2011.00200.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20617172"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Flowers JM, Li SI, Stathos A, Saxer G, Ostrowski EA, Queller DC, Strassmann JE, Purugganan MD |title=Variation, sex, and social cooperation: molecular population genetics of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=e1001013 |date=July 2010  |pmid=20617172 |pmc=2895654 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heterothallic mating occurs when two amoebae of different [[mating type]]s are present in a dark and wet environment, where they can fuse during aggregation to form a giant zygote cell. The giant cell then releases cAMP to attract other cells, then engulfs the other cells cannibalistically in the aggregate. The consumed cells serve to encase the whole aggregate in a thick, cellulose wall to protect it. This is known as a [[macrocyst]]. Inside the macrocyst, the giant cell divides first through [[meiosis]], then through mitosis to produce many [[haploid]] amoebae that will be released to feed as normal amoebae would. Homothallic ''D. discoideum'' strains AC4 and ZA3A are also able to produce macrocysts.&lt;ref name="pmid24189663"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robson GE, Williams KL |title=The mating system of the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum |journal=Curr.

While sexual reproduction is possible, it is very rare to see successful [[germination]] of a ''D. discoideum'' macrocyst under laboratory conditions.  Nevertheless, recombination is widespread within ''D. discoideum'' natural populations, indicating that sex is likely an important aspect of their lifecycle.&lt;ref name="pmid20617172" /&gt;

==Use as a model organism==
Because many of its genes are homologous to human genes, yet its lifecycle is simple, ''D. discoideum'' is commonly used as a [[model organism]]. It can be observed at organismic, cellular, and molecular levels primarily because of their restricted number of cell types and behaviors, and their rapid growth.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt; It is used to study cell differentiation, chemotaxis, and programmed cell death, which are all normal cellular processes. It is also used to study other aspects of development, including cell sorting, pattern formation, phagocytosis, motility, and signal transduction.&lt;ref&gt;Dictybase, About Dictyostelium. [Online] (1, May, 2009). http://dictybase.org/&lt;/ref&gt; These processes and aspects of development are either absent or too difficult to view in other model organisms. ''D. discoideum'' is closely related to higher metazoans. It carries similar genes and pathways, making it a good candidate for [[gene knockout]].&lt;ref&gt;Dilip K. Nag, Disruption of Four Kinesin Genes in Dictyostelium. [Online] (22, April, 2008). http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articlerender.cgi?artid=1529371&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cellular differentiation|cell differentiation]] process occurs when a cell becomes more specialized to develop into a multicellular organism. Changes in size, shape, metabolic activities, and responsiveness can occur as a result of adjustments in gene expression. Cell diversity and differentiation, in this species, involves decisions made from cell-cell interactions in pathways to either stalk cells or spore cells.&lt;ref name="Kay R.R., Garrod D., and Tilly R."&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kay R.R. |author2=Garrod D. |author3=Tilly R. | year = 1978 | title = Requirements for cell differentiation in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 211 | issue = 5640| pages = 58–60 |doi=10.1038/271058a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These cell fates depend on their environment and pattern formation. Therefore, the organism is an excellent model for studying cell differentiation.

[[File:Dictyostelium Aggregation.JPG|thumb|right|''D. discoideum'' exhibiting chemotaxis through aggregation]]
[[Chemotaxis]] is defined as a passage of an organism toward or away from a chemical stimulus along a chemical concentration gradient. Certain organisms demonstrate chemotaxis when they move toward a supply of nutrients. In ''D. discoideum'', the amoeba secretes the signal, cAMP, out of the cell, attracting other amoebae to migrate toward the source. Every amoeba moves toward a central amoeba, the one dispensing the greatest amount of cAMP secretions. The secretion of the cAMP is then exhibited by all amoebae and is a call for them to begin aggregation. These chemical emissions and amoeba movement occur every six minutes. The amoebae move toward the concentration gradient for 60 seconds and stop until the next secretion is sent out. This behavior of individual cells tends to cause oscillations in a group of cells, and chemical waves of varying cAMP concentration propagate through the group in spirals.&lt;ref name=Dusenbery&gt;{{cite book|author=Dusenbery, David B.|year=1996|title=Life at Small Scale|series=Scientific American Library|location=New York|isbn=0-7167-5060-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|174–175}}

An elegant set of mathematical equations that reproduces the spirals and the streaming patterns of ''D. discoideum'' was discovered by mathematical biologists Thomas Höfer and Martin Boerlijst. Mathematical biologist Cornelis J. Weijer has proven that similar equations can model its movement. The equations of these patterns are mainly influenced by the density of the amoeba population, the rate of the production of cyclic AMP and the sensitivity of individual amoebas to cyclic AMP. The spiraling pattern is formed by amoebas at the centre of a colony who rotate as they send out waves of cyclic AMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.whydomath.org/Reading_Room_Material/ian_stewart/2000_11.html|title=Biomathematics Patterns: Spiral Slime.

The use of cAMP as a chemotactic agent is not established in any other organism. In developmental biology, this is one of the comprehensible examples of chemotaxis, which is important for an understanding of human inflammation, arthritis, asthma, lymphocyte trafficking, and axon guidance. Phagocytosis is used in immune surveillance and antigen presentation, while cell-type determination, cell sorting, and pattern formation are basic features of embryogenesis that may be studied with these organisms.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;

[[Thermotaxis]] is movement along a gradient of temperature. The slugs have been shown to migrate along extremely shallow gradients of only 0.05&amp;nbsp;°C/cm, but the direction chosen is complicated; it seems to be away from a temperature about 2&amp;nbsp;°C below the temperature to which they had been acclimated. This complicated behavior has been analyzed by computer modeling of the behavior and the periodic pattern of temperature changes in soil caused by daily changes in air temperature. The conclusion is that the behavior moves slugs a few centimeters below the soil surface up to the surface. This is an amazingly sophisticated behavior by a primitive organism with no apparent sense of gravity.&lt;ref name=Dusenbery/&gt;{{rp|108–109}}

[[Programmed cell death]] (apoptosis) is a normal part of species development.&lt;ref name="Gilbert S.F."/&gt; Apoptosis is necessary for the proper spacing and sculpting of complex organs. Around 20% of cells in ''D. discoideum'' altruistically sacrifice themselves in the formation of the mature fruiting body.  During the pseudoplasmodium (slug or grex) stage of its lifecycle, the organism has formed three main types of cells: prestalk, prespore, and anterior-like cells. During culmination, the prestalk cells secrete a cellulose coat and extend as a tube through the grex.&lt;ref name="Gilbert S.F."/&gt;  As they differentiate, they form vacuoles and enlarge, lifting up the prespore cells. The stalk cells undergo apoptosis and die as the prespore cells are lifted high above the substrate. The prespore cells then become spore cells, each one becoming a new myxamoeba upon dispersal.&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt;  This is an example of how apoptosis is used in the formation of a reproductive organ, the mature fruiting body.

A recent major contribution from ''Dictyostelium'' research has come from new techniques allowing the activity of individual genes to be visualised in living cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16713960 | year = 2006 | last1 = Chubb | first1 = JR | last2 = Trcek | first2 = T | last3 = Shenoy | first3 = SM | last4 = Singer | first4 = RH | title = Transcriptional pulsing of a developmental gene | volume = 16 | issue = 10 | pages = 1018–25 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2006.03.092 | journal = Current Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has shown that transcription occurs in "bursts" or "pulses" ([[transcriptional bursting]]) rather than following simple probabilistic or continuous behaviour.  Bursting transcription now appears to be conserved between bacteria and humans.  Another remarkable feature of the organism is that it has sets of DNA repair enzymes found in human cells, which are lacking from many other popular metazoan model systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hudson J. J. |author2=Hsu D. W. |author3=Guo K. |author4=Zhukovskaya N. |author5=Liu P. H. |author6=Williams J. G. |author7=Pears C. J. |author8=Lakin N.

===Lab cultivation===
This organism's ability to be easily cultivated in the laboratory&lt;ref name="Tyler M.S."/&gt; adds to its appeal as a model organism. While ''D. discoideum'' can be grown in liquid culture, it is usually grown in Petri dishes containing nutrient [[agar]] and the surfaces are kept moist. The cultures grow best at 22–24&amp;nbsp;°C (room temperature). ''D. discoideum'' feed primarily on ''E. coli'', which is adequate for all stages of the lifecycle.  When the food supply is diminished, the myxamoebae aggregate to form pseudoplasmodia. Soon, the dish is covered with various stages of the lifecycle. Checking the dish often allows for detailed observations of development. The cells can be harvested at any stage of development and grown quickly.

While cultivating ''D. discoidium'' in a laboratory, it is important to take into account its behavioral responses. For example, it has an affinity toward light, higher temperatures, high humidity, low ionic concentrations, and the acidic side of the pH gradient. Experiments are often done to see how manipulations of these parameters hinder, stop, or accelerate development. Variations of these parameters can alter the rate and viability of culture growth. Also, the fruiting bodies, being that this is the tallest stage of development, are very responsive to air currents and physical stimuli. It is unknown if there is a stimulus involved with spore release.

===Protein expression studies===
Detailed analysis of protein expression in ''Dictyostelium'' has been hampered by large shifts in the protein expression profile between different developmental stages and a general lack of commercially available antibodies for ''Dictyostelium'' antigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Immunoblotting: Equality for slime molds!|date = July 2013|journal = [[BioTechniques]]|page = 9|type = paper|volume = 55|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, a group at the [[Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre]] reported an antibody-free protein visualization standard for immunoblotting based on detection of [[MCCC1]] using [[streptavidin]] conjugates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The use of strepavidin conjugates as immunoblot loading controls of mitrochondrial markers for use with Dictyostelium discoidium|date = July 2013|last = Davidson|first = Andrew J.|last2 = King|first2 = Jason S.|last3 = Insall|first3 = Robert H.|volume = 55|issue = 1|pages = 39–41|department = Benchmarks|journal = [[BioTechniques]]|type = paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legionnaire's disease===
The bacterial genus ''[[Legionella]]'' includes the species that causes [[legionnaire's disease]] in humans.  ''D. discoideum'' is also a host for ''Legionella'' and is a suitable model for studying the infection process.&lt;ref name="Bruhn H."&gt;Bruhn H. 2008. ''Dictyostelium'', a tractable model host organism for ''Legionella''. In: Heuner K, Swanson M, editors. ''Legionella'': Molecular Microbiology. Norwich (UK): Caister Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-1-904455-26-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, ''D. discoideum'' shares with mammalian host cells a similar cytoskeleton and cellular processes relevant to ''Legionella'' infection, including [[phagocytosis]], membrane trafficking, [[endocytosis]], vesicle sorting, and chemotaxis.

=="Farming"==
A 2011 report in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published findings that demonstrated a "primitive farming behaviour" in ''D. discoideum'' colonies.&lt;ref name="primitive farming behaviour"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12227168 "Amoebas show primitive farming behaviour as they travel"], ''[[BBC News]]'', 19 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brock DA, Douglas TE, Queller DC, Strassmann JE |title=Primitive agriculture in a social amoeba |journal=Nature |volume=469 |issue= 7330|pages=393–396 |date=20 January 2011|pmid= 21248849|doi=10.1038/nature09668 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as a "[[symbiosis]]" between ''D. discoideum'' and bacterial prey, about one-third of wild-collected ''D. discoideum'' colonies engaged in the "[[husbandry]]" of the bacteria when the bacteria were included within the slime mold fruiting bodies.&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt; The incorporation of the bacteria into the fruiting bodies allows the "seeding" of the food source at the location of the spore dispersal, which is particularly valuable if the new location is low in food resources.&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt; Colonies produced from the "farming" spores typically also show the same behavior when sporulating. This incorporation has a cost associated with it: Those colonies that do not consume all of the prey bacteria produce smaller spores that cannot disperse as widely. In addition, much less benefit exists for bacteria-containing spores that land in a food-rich region. This balance of the costs and benefits of the behavior may contribute to the fact that a minority of ''D. discoideum'' colonies engage in this practice.&lt;ref name="primitive farming behaviour"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brock/&gt;
''D. discoideum'' is known for eating [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]], as well as [[Gram-negative bacteria]], but some of the phagocytized bacteria, including some  human pathogens,&lt;ref name=Microreview&gt;{{cite journal |title= Recent insights into host-pathogen interactions from Dyctiostelium |journal=Cellular Microbiology |volume=12 |issue= 3|pages=283–291 |year=2010 |url= |doi=10.1111/j.1462-5822.2009.01413.x |first=Margaret |last=Clarke}}&lt;/ref&gt; are able to live in the amoebae and exit without killing the cell. When they enter the cell, where they reside, and when they leave the cell are not known. The research is not yet conclusive but it is possible to draw a general lifecycle of ''D. discoideum'' adapted for farmer clones to better understand this symbiotic process.[[File:Life-cycle of farmer dictyostelium discoideum.jpg|thumb|Lifecycle of farmer ''D. discoideum'']]

In the picture, one can see the different stages. First, in the starvation stage, bacteria are enclosed within ''D. discoideum'',&lt;ref name=Microreview/&gt; after entry into amoebae, in a phagosome the fusion with lysosomes is blocked and these unmatured phagosomes are surrounded by host cell organelles such as mitochondria, vesicles, and a multilayer membrane derived from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) of amoebae. The role of the RER in the intracellular infection is not known, but the RER is not required as a source of proteins for the bacteria.&lt;ref name=Molmeret&gt;{{cite journal |author= Molmeret M., Horn, M., Wagner, M., Abu Kwaik, Y |title=Primitive Amoebae as Training Grounds for Intracellular Bacterial Pathogens |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |pages=20–28 |date=January 2005 |doi=10.1128/AEM.71.1.20-28.2005 |url= |volume=71 |issue=1|pmc=544274 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The bacteria reside within these phagosomes during the aggregation and the multicellular development stages. The amoebae preserve their individuality and each amoeba has its own bacterium. During the culmination stage, when the spores are produced, the bacteria pass from the cell to the sorus with the help of a cytoskeletal structure that prevents host cell destruction.&lt;ref name=Macroautophagy &gt;{{cite journal |author1=Grant P.Ottom Mary Y.Wu |author2=Margaret Clarke |author3=Hao Lu |author4=O.Roger Anderson |author5=Hubert Hilbi |author6=Howard A. Shuman |author7=Richard H.

Free-living amoebae seem to play a crucial role for persistence and dispersal of some pathogens in the environment. Transient association with amoebae has been reported for a number of different bacteria, including ''Legionella pneumophila'', many ''Mycobacterium'' species, ''Francisella tubarensis'', and ''Escherichia coli'', among others.&lt;ref name=Molmeret/&gt;  Agriculture seems to play a crucial role for pathogens' survival, as they can live and replicate inside ''D. discoideum'', making husbandry. 
''Nature''’s report has made an important advance in the knowledge of amoebic behavior, and the famous Spanish phrase translated as “you are more stupid than an amoeba” is losing the sense because amoebae are an excellent example of social behavior with an amazing coordination and sense of sacrifice for the benefit of the species.

== Sentinel cells ==
[[Sentinel cell]]s in ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' are phagocytic cells responsible for removing toxic material from the slug stage of the social cycle. Generally round in shape, these cells are present within the slug sheath where they are found to be circulating freely. The detoxification process occurs when these cells engulf toxins and pathogens within the slug through [[phagocytosis]]. Then, the cells clump into groups of five to ten cells, which then attach to the inner sheath of the slug. The sheath is sloughed off as the slug migrates to a new site in search of food bacteria.

Sentinel cells make up approximately 1% of the total number of slug cells, and the number of sentinel cells remains constant even as they are being released. This indicates a constant regeneration of sentinel cells within the slugs as they are being removed along with toxins and pathogens. Sentinel cells are present in the slug even when there are no toxins or pathogens to be removed. Sentinel cells have been located in five other species of ''Dictyostelia'', which suggests that sentinel cells can be described as a general characteristic of the [[innate immune system]] in social amoebae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Guokai |last2=Zhuchenko |first2=Olga |last3=Kuspa |first3=Adam |date=2007-08-03 |title=Immune-like Phagocyte Activity in the Social Amoeba |journal=Science |location=New York, NY |volume=317 |issue=5838 |pages=678–681 |doi=10.1126/science.1143991 |issn=0036-8075 |pmc=3291017 |pmid=17673666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of farming status on sentinel cells ===
The number of sentinel cells varies depending on the farming status of wild ''D. discoideum''. When exposed to a toxic environment created by the use of ethidium bromide, it was shown that the number of sentinel cells per millimeter was lower for farmers than non-farmers. This was concluded by observing the trails left behind as the slugs migrated and counting the number of sentinel cells present in a millimeter. However, the number of sentinel cells does not affect the spore production and viability in farmers. Farmers exposed to a toxic environment produce the same number of spores as farmers in a non-toxic environment, and the spore viability was the same between the farmers and non-farmers. When Clade 2 ''[[Burkholderia]]'', or farmer-associated bacteria, are removed from the farmers, spore production and viability were similar to that of the non-farmers. Thus, it is suggested that bacteria carried by the farmers provide an additional role of protection for the farmers against potential harm due to toxins or pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brock |first=Debra A. |last2=Callison |first2=W.

==Classification and phylogeny==

In older classifications, ''Dictyostelium'' was placed in the defunct [[polyphyletic]] class [[Acrasiomycete]]s. This was a class of cellular slime molds, which was characterized by the aggregation of individual amoebae into a multicellular fruiting body, making it an important factor that related the acrasids to the dictyostelids.&lt;ref name="Cavender J.C., Spiegl F., Swanson A."&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cavender J.C. |author2=Spiegl F. |author3=Swanson A. | year = 2002 | title = Taxonomy, slime molds, and the questions we ask | url = | journal = The Mycological Society of America | volume =  94| issue = 6| pages = 968–979 |pmid=21156570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent genomic studies have shown that ''Dictyostelium'' has maintained more of its ancestral genome diversity than plants and animals, although  proteome-based phylogeny confirms that amoebozoa diverged from the animal–fungal lineage after the plant–animal split.&lt;ref name=Eichenger&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eichenger L. | year = 2005 | title = The genome of the social amoeba ''Dictyostelium discoideum'' | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7038| pages = 34–57 |pmid=15875012 | doi = 10.1038/nature03481 | pmc = 1352341 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subclass Dictyosteliidae, order Dictyosteliales is a monophyletic assemblage within the Mycetozoa, a group that includes the protostelid, dictyostelid, and myxogastrid slime molds.  
Elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) data analyses support Mycetozoa as a monophyletic group, though rRNA trees place it as a polyphyletic group.  Further, these data support the idea that the dictyostelid and myxogastrid are more closely related to each other than they are the protostelids.  EF-1α analysis also placed the Mycetozoa as the immediate outgroup for the animal-fungal clade.&lt;ref name=Baldauf&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Baldauf S.L. |author2=Doolittle W.F. | year = 1997 | title = Origin and evolution of the slime molds (Mycetozoa) | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 94 | issue =22 | pages = 12007–12012 |pmc=23686 | pmid=9342353 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.22.12007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latest phylogenetic data place dictyostelids firmly within supergroup [[Amoebozoa]], along with [[Mycetozoa|myxomycetes]].  Meanwhile, [[Protosteloid|protostelids]] have turned out to be polyphyletic, their stalked fruiting bodies a convergent feature of multiple unrelated lineages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0006754 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0006754 | volume=4 | issue=8 | title=Eumycetozoa = Amoebozoa?: SSUrDNA Phylogeny of Protosteloid Slime Molds and Its Significance for the Amoebozoan Supergroup | journal=PLoS ONE | pages=e6754 | pmid=19707546 | pmc=2727795 | last1 = Shadwick | first1 = LL | last2 = Spiegel | first2 = FW | last3 = Shadwick | first3 = JD | last4 = Brown | first4 = MW | last5 = Silberman | first5 = JD| year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genome==
The ''D. discoideum'' [[genome]] sequencing project was completed and published in 2005 by an international collaboration of institutes. This was the first free-living protozoan genome to be fully sequenced. ''D. discoideum'' consists of a 34-Mb haploid genome with a base composition of 77% [A+T] and contains six chromosomes that encode around 12,500 proteins.&lt;ref name="Eichinger L."/&gt; Sequencing of the ''D. discoideum'' genome  provides a more intricate study of its cellular and developmental biology.

Tandem repeats of trinucleotides are very abundant in this genome; one class of the genome is clustered, leading researchers to believe it serves as centromeres. The repeats correspond to repeated sequences of amino acids and are thought to be expanded by nucleotide expansion.&lt;ref name="Eichinger L."/&gt; Expansion of trinucleotide repeats also occurs in humans, in general leading to many diseases. Learning how ''D. discoideum'' cells endure these amino acid repeats may provide insight to allow humans to tolerate them.

Every genome sequenced plays an important role in identifying genes that have been gained or lost over time. Comparative genomic studies allow for comparison of eukaryotic genomes. A phylogeny based on the proteome showed that the amoebozoa deviated from the animal-fungal lineage after the plant-animal split.&lt;ref name="Eichinger L."/&gt; The ''D. discoideum'' genome is noteworthy because its many encoded proteins are commonly found in fungi, plants, and animals.&lt;ref name="Eichinger L."/&gt;

{{Evolutionary biology}}
A '''digital organism''' is a [[Self-replication|self-replicating]] [[computer program]] that [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutates]] and [[Evolutionary algorithm|evolves]].  Digital [[organism]]s are used as a tool to study the dynamics of Darwinian [[evolution]], and to test or verify specific hypotheses or [[mathematical model]]s of evolution.  The study of digital organisms is closely related to the area of [[artificial life]].

== History ==
Digital organisms can be traced back to the game [[Darwin (programming game)|Darwin]], developed in 1961 at Bell Labs, in which computer programs had to compete with each other by trying to stop others from [[Execution (computing)|executing]] .&lt;ref&gt;Aleph-Null, "Computer Recreations", Software: Practice and Experience, vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;93–96, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; A similar implementation that followed this was the game [[Core War]]. In Core War, it turned out that one of the winning [[strategy|strategies]] was to replicate as fast as possible, which deprived the opponent of all [[resource (computer science)|computational resources]].  Programs in the Core War game were also able to mutate themselves and each other by overwriting instructions in the simulated "memory" in which the game took place.  This allowed competing programs to embed damaging instructions in each other that caused errors (terminating the process that read it), "enslaved processes" (making an enemy program work for you), or even change strategies mid-game and heal themselves.

[[Steen Rasmussen]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] took the idea from Core War one step further in his core world system by introducing a genetic algorithm that automatically wrote programs. However, Rasmussen did not observe the evolution of complex and stable programs. It turned out that the [[programming language]] in which core world programs were written was very brittle, and more often than not mutations would completely destroy the functionality of a program.

The first to solve the issue of program brittleness was [[Thomas S. Ray]] with his [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] system, which was similar to core world. Ray made some key changes to the programming language such that mutations were much less likely to destroy a program. With these modifications, he observed for the first time computer programs that did indeed evolve in a meaningful and complex way.

Later, [[Chris Adami]], Titus Brown, and [[Charles Ofria]] started developing their [[Avida]] system,&lt;ref&gt;http://avida.devosoft.org/&lt;/ref&gt; which was inspired by Tierra but again had some crucial differences. In Tierra, all programs lived in the same [[address space]] and could potentially overwrite or otherwise interfere with each other. In Avida, on the other hand, each program lives in its own address space. Because of this modification, experiments with Avida became much cleaner and easier to interpret than those with Tierra. With Avida, digital organism research has begun to be accepted as a valid contribution to evolutionary biology by a growing number of evolutionary biologists.  Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Lenski]] of [[Michigan State University]] has used Avida extensively in his work.  Lenski, Adami, and their colleagues have published in journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' (USA).

In 1996, Andy Pargellis created a Tierra-like system called ''Amoeba'' that evolved self-replication from a randomly seeded initial condition.

In [[applied mathematics]], '''discretization''' is the process of transferring [[continuous function|continuous]] functions, models, variables, and equations into [[wiktionary:discrete|discrete]] counterparts.  This process is usually carried out as a first step toward making them suitable for numerical evaluation and implementation on digital computers. '''Dichotomization''' is the special case of discretization in which the number of discrete classes is 2, which can approximate a continuous variable as a [[binary variable]] (creating a [[dichotomy]] for [[conceptual model|modeling]] purposes, as in [[binary classification]]). 

Discretization is also related to [[discrete mathematics]], and is an important component of [[granular computing]].  In this context, ''discretization'' may also refer to modification of variable or category ''granularity'', as when multiple discrete variables are aggregated or multiple discrete categories fused.

Whenever continuous data is '''discretized''', there is always some amount of [[discretization error]]. The goal is to reduce the amount to a level considered [[wikt:negligible|negligible]] for the [[conceptual model|modeling]] purposes at hand.

{{Anchor|Discretization-quantization}} The terms ''discretization '' and ''[[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]]''&lt;!-- Do not tag bomb this link with {{dn}}; its target is at the intentional and appropriate level of polysemy. --&gt; often have the same [[denotation]] but not always identical [[connotations]].&lt;!-- If you need deeper exploration of this truth, you will need to go read about [[cognitive synonymy]] and the lack of it in natural language. --&gt; (Specifically, the two terms share a [[semantic field]].) The same is true of [[discretization error]] and [[quantization error]].

Mathematical methods relating to discretization include the [[Euler–Maruyama method]] and the [[zero-order hold]].

== Discretization of linear state space models {{anchor|discrete function}} ==
Discretization is also concerned with the transformation of continuous [[differential equation]]s into discrete [[difference equations]], suitable for [[Numerical analysis|numerical computing]].

The following continuous-time [[State space (controls)|state space model]]

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \mathbf A \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf B \mathbf{u}(t) + \mathbf{w}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \mathbf C \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf D \mathbf{u}(t) + \mathbf{v}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' and ''w'' are continuous zero-mean [[white noise]] sources with [[power spectral density | power spectral densities]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}(t) \sim N(0,\mathbf Q)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(t) \sim N(0,\mathbf R)&lt;/math&gt;

can be discretized, assuming [[zero-order hold]] for the input ''u'' and continuous integration for the noise ''v'', to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}[k+1] = \mathbf A_d \mathbf{x}[k] + \mathbf B_d \mathbf{u}[k] + \mathbf{w}[k]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}[k] = \mathbf C_d \mathbf{x}[k] + \mathbf D_d \mathbf{u}[k] +  \mathbf{v}[k]&lt;/math&gt;

with covariances

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}[k] \sim N(0,\mathbf Q_d)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}[k] \sim N(0,\mathbf R_d)&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A_d = e^{\mathbf A T} = \mathcal{L}^{-1}\{(s\mathbf I - \mathbf A)^{-1}\}_{t=T} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf B_d = \left( \int_{\tau=0}^{T}e^{\mathbf A \tau}d\tau \right) \mathbf B = \mathbf A^{-1}(\mathbf A_d - I)\mathbf B &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt; is [[Invertible matrix|nonsingular]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf C_d = \mathbf C &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf D_d = \mathbf D &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf Q_d = \int_{\tau=0}^{T} e^{\mathbf A \tau} \mathbf Q e^{\mathbf A^\top \tau}  d\tau &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf R_d = \mathbf R T &lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the sample time, although &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A^\top&lt;/math&gt; is the transposed matrix of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;.

A clever trick to compute ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; in one step is by utilizing the following property:&lt;ref&gt;Raymond DeCarlo: ''Linear Systems: A State Variable Approach with Numerical Implementation'', Prentice Hall, NJ, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 215}}
:&lt;math&gt;e^{\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{A} &amp; \mathbf{B} \\
                 \mathbf{0} &amp; \mathbf{0} \end{bmatrix} T} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{M_{11}} &amp; \mathbf{M_{12}} \\
                                                            \mathbf{0} &amp; \mathbf{I} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and then having
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A_d = \mathbf M_{11}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf B_d = \mathbf M_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Discretization of process noise ===
Numerical evaluation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}_d&lt;/math&gt; is a bit trickier due to the matrix exponential integral. It can, however, be computed by first constructing a matrix, and computing the exponential of it &lt;ref&gt;Charles Van Loan: ''Computing integrals involving the matrix exponential'', IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control. 23 (3): 395–404, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = 
\begin{bmatrix} -\mathbf{A} &amp; \mathbf{Q} \\
                 \mathbf{0} &amp; \mathbf{A}^\top \end{bmatrix} T&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{G} = e^\mathbf{F} =
\begin{bmatrix} \dots &amp; \mathbf{A}_d^{-1}\mathbf{Q}_d \\
           \mathbf{0} &amp; \mathbf{A}_d^\top             \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
The discretized process noise is then evaluated by multiplying the transpose of the lower-right partition of '''G''' with the upper-right partition of '''G''':
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}_d = (\mathbf{A}_d^\top)^\top (\mathbf{A}_d^{-1}\mathbf{Q}_d) = \mathbf{A}_d (\mathbf{A}_d^{-1}\mathbf{Q}_d). &lt;/math&gt;

=== Derivation ===
Starting with the continuous model
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\dot{x}}(t) = \mathbf A\mathbf x(t) + \mathbf B \mathbf u(t)&lt;/math&gt;
we know that the [[matrix exponential]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}e^{\mathbf At} = \mathbf A e^{\mathbf At} = e^{\mathbf At} \mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;
and by premultiplying the model we get
:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\mathbf At} \mathbf{\dot{x}}(t) = e^{-\mathbf At} \mathbf A\mathbf x(t) + e^{-\mathbf At} \mathbf B\mathbf u(t)&lt;/math&gt;
which we recognize as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-\mathbf At}\mathbf x(t)) = e^{-\mathbf At} \mathbf B\mathbf u(t)&lt;/math&gt;
and by integrating..
:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\mathbf At}\mathbf x(t) - e^0\mathbf x(0) = \int_0^t e^{-\mathbf A\tau}\mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d\tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t) = e^{\mathbf At}\mathbf x(0) + \int_0^t e^{\mathbf A(t-\tau)} \mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d \tau&lt;/math&gt;
which is an analytical solution to the continuous model.

Now we want to discretise the above expression. We assume that u is [[mathematical constant|constant]] during each timestep.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k] \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \mathbf x(kT)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k] = e^{\mathbf AkT}\mathbf x(0) + \int_0^{kT} e^{\mathbf A(kT-\tau)} \mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d \tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k+1] = e^{\mathbf A(k+1)T}\mathbf x(0) + \int_0^{(k+1)T} e^{\mathbf A((k+1)T-\tau)} \mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d \tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k+1] = e^{\mathbf AT} \left[  e^{\mathbf AkT}\mathbf x(0) + \int_0^{kT} e^{\mathbf A(kT-\tau)} \mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d \tau \right]+ \int_{kT}^{(k+1)T} e^{\mathbf A(kT+T-\tau)} \mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d \tau&lt;/math&gt;
We recognize the bracketed expression as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k]&lt;/math&gt;, and the second term can be simplified by substituting with the function &lt;math&gt;v(\tau) = kT + T - \tau&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;d\tau=-dv&lt;/math&gt;. We also assume that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is constant during the [[integral]], which in turn yields
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{matrix} \mathbf x[k+1]&amp;=&amp; e^{\mathbf AT}\mathbf x[k] - \left( \int_{v(kT)}^{v((k+1)T)} e^{\mathbf Av} dv \right) \mathbf B\mathbf u[k] \\
&amp;=&amp; e^{\mathbf AT}\mathbf x[k] - \left( \int_T^0 e^{\mathbf Av} dv \right) \mathbf B\mathbf u[k] \\
&amp;=&amp; e^{\mathbf AT}\mathbf x[k] + \left( \int_0^T e^{\mathbf Av} dv \right) \mathbf B\mathbf u[k] \\
&amp;=&amp;e^{\mathbf AT}\mathbf x[k] + \mathbf A^{-1}\left(e^{\mathbf AT}-\mathbf I \right) \mathbf B\mathbf u[k] \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
which is an exact solution to the discretization problem.

=== Approximations ===
Exact discretization may sometimes be intractable due to the heavy matrix exponential and integral operations involved. It is much easier to calculate an approximate discrete model, based on that for small timesteps &lt;math&gt;e^{\mathbf AT} \approx \mathbf I + \mathbf A T&lt;/math&gt;. The approximate solution then becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k+1] \approx (\mathbf I + \mathbf AT) \mathbf x[k] + T\mathbf B \mathbf u[k] &lt;/math&gt;

Other possible approximations are &lt;math&gt;e^{\mathbf AT} \approx \left( \mathbf I - \mathbf A T \right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^{\mathbf AT} \approx \left( \mathbf I +\frac{1}{2}  \mathbf A T \right) \left( \mathbf I - \frac{1}{2} \mathbf A T \right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Each of them have different stability properties. The last one is known as the [[bilinear transform]], or Tustin transform, and preserves the (in)stability of the continuous-time system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12667">'''Disease gene identification''' is a process by which scientists identify the mutant genotypes responsible for an inherited [[genetic disorder]]. [[DNA mutations#Classification of mutation types|Mutations]] in these genes can include single nucleotide substitutions, single nucleotide additions/deletions, deletion of the entire gene, and other genetic abnormalities.

== Significance ==

Knowledge of which genes (when non-functional) cause which disorders will simplify diagnosis of patients and provide insights into the functional characteristics of the mutation.  The advent of modern-day [[DNA Sequencing#High-throughput sequencing|high-throughput sequencing]] technologies combined with insights provided from the growing field of [[genomics]] is resulting in more rapid disease gene identification, thus allowing scientists to identify more complex mutations.

[[File:Disease Gene Mapping with Multiple Chromosomes.jpg|thumb|Chromosomes on the left show possible disease gene locations (as identified by any of the below methods) for affected individuals. Red area in the 'composite chromosome' on the right signifies the overlap of these regions, and thus the most probable location of the disease gene]]

== Generic gene identification procedure ==

Disease gene identification techniques often follow the same overall procedure.  DNA is first collected from several patients who are believed to have the same genetic disease.  Then, their DNA samples are analyzed and screened to determine probable regions where the mutation could potentially reside.  These techniques are mentioned below.  These probable regions are then lined-up with one another and the overlapping region should contain the mutant gene.  If enough of the genome sequence is known, that region is searched for [[candidate gene]]s.  Coding regions of these genes are then sequenced until a mutation is discovered or another patient is discovered, in which case the analysis can be repeated, potentially narrowing down the region of interest. 
	
The differences between most disease gene identification procedures are in the second step (where DNA samples are analyzed and screened to determine regions in which the mutation could reside).

=== Pre-genomics techniques ===

Without the aid of the whole-genome sequences, pre-genomics investigations looked at select regions of the genome, often with only minimal knowledge of the gene sequences they were looking at.  Genetic techniques capable of providing this sort of information include [[Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism]] (RFLP) analysis and [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] analysis.

==== Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) ====

[[Loss of heterozygosity|Loss of heterozygosity (LOH)]] is a technique that can only be used to compare two samples from the same individual.  LOH analysis is often used when identifying cancer-causing [[oncogenes]] in that one sample consists of (mutant) tumor DNA and the other (control) sample consists of genomic DNA from non-cancerous cells from the same individual.  RFLPs and microsatellite markers provide patterns of DNA polymorphisms, which can be interpreted as residing in a [[heterozygous]] region or a [[homozygous]] region of the genome.  Provided that all individuals are affected with the same disease resulting from a manifestation of a deletion of a single copy of the same gene, all individuals will contain one region where their control sample is heterozygous but the mutant sample is homozygous - this region will contain the disease gene.&lt;ref name="pmid2649981"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baker SJ, Fearon ER, Nigro JM, Hamilton SR, Preisinger AC, Jessup JM, vanTuinen P, Ledbetter DH, Barker DF, Nakamura Y, White R, Vogelstein B | title = Chromosome 17 deletions and p53 gene mutations in colorectal carcinomas | journal = Science | volume = 244 | issue = 4901 | pages = 217–21 |date=April 1989 | pmid = 2649981 | doi = 10.1126/science.2649981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10952779"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee AS, Seo YC, Chang A, Tohari S, Eu KW, Seow-Choen F, McGee JO | title = Detailed deletion mapping at chromosome 11q23 in colorectal carcinoma | journal = Br.

=== Post-genomics techniques ===

With the advent of modern laboratory techniques such as [[DNA Sequencing#High-throughput sequencing|High-throughput sequencing]] and software capable of genome-wide analysis, sequence acquisition has become increasingly less expensive and time-consuming, thus providing significant benefits to science in the form of more efficient disease gene identification techniques.

==== Identity by descent mapping ====

[[Identity by descent]] (IBD) mapping generally uses [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) arrays to survey known polymorphic sites throughout the genome of affected individuals and their parents and/or siblings, both affected and unaffected.  While these SNPs probably do not cause the disease, they provide valuable insight into the makeup of the genomes in question. A region of the genome is considered identical by descent if contiguous SNPs share the same genotype.  When comparing an affected individual to his/her affected sibling, all identical regions are recorded (ex. Shaded in red in above figure).  Given that an affected sibling and an unaffected sibling do not have the same disease phenotype, their DNA must by definition be different (barring the presence of a genetic or environmental [[Modifier gene|modifier]]).  Thus, the IBD mapping results can be further supplemented by removing any regions that are identical in both affected individuals and unaffected siblings.&lt;ref name="pmid21406686"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bell R, Herring SM, Gokul N, Monita M, Grove ML, Boerwinkle E, Doris PA | title = High-resolution identity by descent mapping uncovers the genetic basis for blood pressure differences between spontaneously hypertensive rat lines | journal = Circ Cardiovasc Genet | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 223–31 |date=June 2011 | pmid = 21406686 | pmc = 3116070 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.110.958934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is then repeated for multiple families, thus generating a small, overlapping fragment, which theoretically contains the disease gene.

==== Homozygosity/autozygosity mapping ====

Homozygosity/Autozygosity mapping is a powerful technique, but is only valid when searching for a mutation segregating within a small, closed population.  Such a small population, possibly created by the [[founder effect]], will have a limited gene pool, and thus any inherited disease will probably be a result of two copies of the same mutation segregating on the same [[haplotype]].  Since affected individuals will probably be homozygous in the regions, looking at SNPs in a region is an adequate marker of regions of homozygosity and heterozygosity.  Modern day [[SNP array]]s are used to survey the genome and identify large regions of homozygosity.  Homozygous blocks in the genomes of affected individuals can then be laid on top of each other, and the overlapping region should contain the disease gene.&lt;ref name="pmid18926513"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sherman EA, Strauss KA, Tortorelli S, Bennett MJ, Knerr I, Morton DH, Puffenberger EG | title = Genetic mapping of glutaric aciduria, type 3, to chromosome 7 and identification of mutations in c7orf10 | journal = Am. J. Hum. Genet. | volume = 83 | issue = 5 | pages = 604–9 |date=November 2008 | pmid = 18926513 | pmc = 2668038 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.09.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This analysis is often extended by analyzing [[autozygosity]], an extension of homozygosity, in the genomes of affected individuals.&lt;ref name="Broman_Weber_1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Broman KW, Weber JL | title = Long homozygous chromosomal segments in reference families from the centre d'Etude du polymorphisme humain | journal = Am. J. Hum. Genet. | volume = 65 | issue = 6 | pages = 1493–500 |date=December 1999 | pmid = 10577902 | pmc = 1288359 | doi = 10.1086/302661 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be accomplished by plotting a cumulative [[LOD score#LOD score method for estimating recombination frequency|LOD score]] alongside the overlaid blocks of homozygosity.  By taking into consideration the population allele frequencies for all SNPs via autozygosity mapping, the results of homozygosity can be confirmed.&lt;ref name="Broman_Weber_1999"/&gt;  Furthermore, if two suspicious regions appear as a result of homozygosity mapping, autozygosity mapping may be able to distinguish between the two (ex. If one block of homozygosity is a result of a very non-diverse region of the genome, the LOD score will be very low).

Tools for Homozygosity Mapping

==== Genome-wide knockdown studies ====

Genome-wide [[RNA interference#Gene knockdown|knockdown]] studies are an example of the [[reverse genetics]] made possible by the acquisition of whole genome sequences, and the advent of genomics and gene-silencing technologies, mainly [[siRNA]] and [[deletion mapping]].  Genome-wide knockdown studies involve systematic knockdown or deletion of genes or segments of the genome.&lt;ref name="pmid19490893"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Luo J, Emanuele MJ, Li D, Creighton CJ, Schlabach MR, Westbrook TF, Wong KK, Elledge SJ | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen identifies multiple synthetic lethal interactions with the Ras oncogene | journal = Cell | volume = 137 | issue = 5 | pages = 835–48 |date=May 2009 | pmid = 19490893 | pmc = 2768667 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.05.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is generally done in [[prokaryotes]] or in a [[tissue culture]] environment due to the massive number of knockdowns that must be performed.&lt;ref name="Fortier_2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fortier S, Bilodeau M, Macrae T, Laverdure JP, Azcoitia V, Girard S, Chagraoui J, Ringuette N, Hébert J, Krosl J, Mayotte N, Sauvageau G | title = Genome-wide interrogation of Mammalian stem cell fate determinants by nested chromosome deletions | journal = PLoS Genet. | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = e1001241 | year = 2010 | pmid = 21170304 | pmc = 3000362 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the systematic knockout is completed (and possibly confirmed by mRNA expression analysis), the phenotypic results of the knockdown/knockout can be observed.  Observation parameters can be selected to target a highly specific phenotype.&lt;ref name="Fortier_2010"/&gt;  The resulting dataset is then be queried for samples which exhibit phenotypes matching the disease in question – the gene(s) knocked down/out in said samples can then be considered candidate disease genes for the individual in question.

==== Whole exome sequencing ====

Whole [[exome sequencing]] is a brute-force approach that involves using modern day sequencing technology and [[sequence assembly|DNA sequence assembly]] tools to piece together all coding portions of the genome.  The sequence is then compared to a [[reference genome]] and any differences are noted.  After filtering out all known benign polymorphisms, synonymous changes, and [[intronic]] changes (that do not affect splice sites), only potentially pathogenic variants will be left.  This technique can be combined with other techniques to further exclude potentially pathogenic variants should more than one be identified.&lt;ref name="pmid22101681"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen WJ, Lin Y, Xiong ZQ, Wei W, Ni W, Tan GH, Guo SL, He J, Chen YF, Zhang QJ, Li HF, Lin Y, Murong SX, Xu J, Wang N, Wu ZY | title = Exome sequencing identifies truncating mutations in PRRT2 that cause paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia | journal = Nat.

'''Edwardian Baroque''' is the [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]] architectural style of many public buildings built in the [[British Empire]] during the [[Edwardian era]] (1901–1910).

==Description==
The characteristic features of the Edwardian Baroque style were drawn from two main sources: the architecture of France during the 18th century and that of Sir [[Christopher Wren]] in [[England]] during the 17th—part of the [[English Baroque]]. [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]] was a major exponent, designing many commercial buildings in what he termed 'the Grand Style' during the later 1910s and 1920s. This period of British architectural history is considered a particularly retrospective one, since it is contemporary with [[Art Nouveau]].

Typical details of Edwardian Baroque architecture include extensive [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]], usually more extreme at ground level, often running into and exaggerating the [[voussoir]]s of arched openings (derived from French models); domed corner rooftop pavilions and a central taller tower-like element creating a lively rooftop silhouette; revived Italian Baroque elements such as exaggerated keystones, segmental arched pediments, columns with engaged blocks, attached block-like rustication to window surrounds; [[colonnades]] of (sometimes paired) columns in the [[Ionic order]] and domed towers modelled closely on Wren's for the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Royal Naval College]] in [[Greenwich]]. Some Edwardian Baroque buildings include details from other sources, such as the [[Dutch gable]]s of [[Norman Shaw]]'s [[Le Meridien Hotel Piccadilly|Piccadilly Hotel]] in [[London]].

[[File:Demonstration of pumping faecal sludge from a "wet" VIP pit (8152015980).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Fecal sludge from a [[pit latrine]] is pumped out to empty the pit ([[Durban]], South Africa)]]

'''Fecal sludge management''' ('''FSM''') (or '''faecal sludge management''' in [[British English]]) is the collection, transport, and treatment of fecal sludge from [[pit latrine]]s, [[septic tank]]s or other [[Sanitation#Onsite sanitation|onsite sanitation]] systems. Fecal sludge is a mixture of [[human excreta]], water and [[Municipal solid waste|solid wastes]] (e.g. [[toilet paper]] or other [[anal cleansing]] materials, [[Feminine hygiene|menstrual hygiene]] materials) that are disposed in pits, tanks or vaults of onsite sanitation systems. Fecal sludge that is removed from septic tanks is called '''septage'''. 

FSM is necessary in densely populated areas where a proportion of population is not connected to a [[sewerage|sewerage network]], and the covering and rebuilding pit latrines is not possible. This is the case in most urban areas of [[developing countries]], but such services are also used in developed countries where sewerage systems are unavailable. FSM services are usually provided by formal and informal private sector services providers, local governments, water authorities and [[Public utility|utilities]]. However, in many developing countries FSM services are often unavailable or if they are available are often informal, unregulated, unhygienic and unsafe. This can lead to [[Water pollution|surface water]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[groundwater pollution]], spreading of [[pathogen]]s into the environment and adverse [[public health]] impacts. It can also result in unreliable services with relatively high costs to the households which need them.

Fecal sludge collection services can be made available on a scheduled basis or on a call-for-service basis (also known as on-demand, on-request or non-scheduled services). The collected fecal sludge may be transported to treatment plants by using a [[vacuum truck]]; a tank and pump mounted on a flatbed truck; a small tank pulled by a motorcycle; or in containers on a hand cart. Mobile or permanent transfer stations can be used to improve the efficiency of fecal sludge transportation by transferring the waste to larger tankers for haulage to treatment. The wider use of multiple decentralized sludge treatment facilities within the city (to avoid long haulage distances) is currently being researched and piloted.

The collected fecal sludge should preferably be processed at dedicated fecal sludge treatment plants, instead of being co-treated with [[sewage]] in municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants, unless these are able to take the additional load, and facilities to separate liquids and solids are available.&lt;ref name="FSM book 9"&gt;Strande, L., Ronteltap, M., Brdjanovic, D.

IWA Publishing, UK ({{ISBN|9781780404738}})&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of mechanized and non-mechanized processing technologies may be used, including [[constructed wetland]]s, [[anaerobic digestion]], and [[waste stabilization pond]]s. The treatment process can produce useful products such as treated [[effluent]] that can be used for [[irrigation]]. Another possibility is to use the treated fecal sludge after [[compost]]ing as a [[soil conditioner]] or for the production of [[biogas]], charcoal, [[biodiesel]], powdered industrial fuel and [[electricity]]. Historically, the term [[night soil]] was used for fecal sludge.&lt;ref name="Tilley" /&gt; {{TOC level|3}}

[[Image:Septage pump truck Highland Michigan.JPG|thumb|right|Vacuum truck to transport septage, [[Highland, Michigan]]]]
Fecal sludge management (FSM) requires safe and hygienic [[septic tank]] and [[pit latrine]] emptying services, along with the effective treatment of solids and liquids and the reuse of treated produce where possible.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Strande, L., Ronteltap, M., Brdjanovic, D. (eds.) (2014). [http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publikationen/faecal-sludge-management-fsm-book/ Faecal Sludge Management (FSM) book - Systems Approach for Implementation and Operation]. IWA Publishing, UK ({{ISBN|9781780404738}})&lt;/ref&gt; It may include a range of options including on-site and offsite treatment, and the dispersal or capture and further processing of the products of the treatment process into such as [[biogas]], [[compost]] and energy.

FSM is used synonymously with the term "septage management", but they are not the same. Septage is a specific type of fecal sludge: it is the partially digested fecal solids that accumulates in septic tanks. Fecal sludge from pit latrines may have a lower water content compared to septage and may contain more solid waste. 

Pit latrines generate fecal sludge, and these are sometimes classified as [[dry toilet]]s, although wet pits are also common, especially in Asia. However, other types of dry toilets - those that are designed to be easily emptied, without the addition of water - do not generate fecal sludge but dried [[Human feces|feces]] (in the case of [[urine-diverting dry toilet]]s) or [[compost]] (in the case of [[composting toilet]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s), for example. In the case of [[Arborloo]] toilets, nothing is ever extracted from the pit and, instead, the lightweight outhouse/superstructure is moved to another shallow hole and a tree is planted on top of the filled hole.

Collectively, the collection, transport, treatment and [[reuse of excreta]] constitute the "value chain" of fecal sludge management.

In India some government policy documents are using the term FSSM for "Fecal sludge and septage management".&lt;ref&gt;National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) and Urban Management Centre (UMC) (2018). [https://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/3221 Faecal Sludge and Septage Management: An Orientation Module]. National Institute of Urban Affairs, New Delhi&lt;/ref&gt;

===Septage===
{{Further|Septic tank}}
Septage or "septic tank sludge" is partially treated sludge that is accumulated and stored in a [[septic tank]] or similar [[onsite sewage facility]]. Septage is a by-product from the pretreatment of household wastewater ([[sewage]]) in a septic tank. After a few years of accumulation, septage is usually pumped out of a septic tank by a [[vacuum truck]]. Septic tanks are receiving [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] from [[Flush toilet|flush toilets]], as well as [[greywater]]. This means that septage only contains the kind of solid waste that can be flushed, such as [[toilet paper]]. Septage may also include "scum", which is material that floats at the top and contains fats, oil and grease as well as any floating solid waste.  

The term "septage" has been used in the United States since at least 1992.&lt;ref&gt;USAID (1992) [http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/30004NKA.pdf Guide to Septage Treatment and Disposal], United States Environmental Protection Agency, USA&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used in projects by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;AECOM International Development, Inc. and the Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries (Sandec) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) (2010) [http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADS118.pdf A Rapid Assessment of Septage Management in Asia'','' Policies and Practies in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam]
&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition of septage is: "A historical term to define sludge removed from septic tanks."&lt;ref name="Tilley"&gt;Tilley, E., Ulrich, L., Lüthi, C., Reymond, Ph. and Zurbrügg, C. (2014). [http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies (2nd Revised Edition)].

Septage waste is periodically removed (with a frequency depending on tank capacity, system efficiency, and usage level, but typically less often than annually) from the septic tanks by specialized vehicles known as vacuum truck. They pump the septage out of the tank, and transport it to a local [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plant]]. It could also be used by farmers for fertilizer, or stored in large septage waste storage facilities for later treatment or use on crops.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Such research is being carried out and funded by many organizations, and also at scale by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;Chowdhry, S., Koné, D. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1662 Business Analysis of Fecal Sludge Management: Emptying and Transportation Services in Africa and Asia] - Draft final report. Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

In many developing countries, fecal sludge is not properly managed. This may be due to a lack of mandated institutions and little awareness of the impact of poor sanitation; the lack of technical expertise and experience; inability to source funds for to purchase of vacuum trucks and treatment, or lack of knowledge required to be initiate and implement successful FSM programs. This can result in the poor performance of onsite sanitation facilities (OSSFs), septic tank and pit latrine overflows, unsafe emptying of pit latrines, and the dumping of untreated pathogenic fecal sludge into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;WIN-SA (2011).

=== Purposes ===
[[File:Desluding using proper PPE. Dumaguete Philippines.jpg|thumb|Desludging using proper [[personal protective equipment]] in Dumaguete, Philippines]]
[[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Goal 6]] of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] for (water and) sanitation has helped to increase awareness of the risks of poor sanitation management along the entire sanitation chain. It has provided a motivation to many countries, cities and organizations to improve the range of improved sanitation services available. Among these are FSM programs to:{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}  
* Improve the functioning of onsite sanitation systems and to reduce the potential for human contact with fecal-borne pathogens;
* Minimize odors and nuisances, and the uncontrolled discharge of organic matter from overflowing tanks or pits;
* Support the upgrading of onsite sanitation upgrading programs;
* Safeguard public health against indiscriminate disposal of collected fecal sludge;
* Derive agricultural and energy products, including soil conditioner from composting or co-composting and energy products such as biogas, charcoal pellets, industrial powdered fuel etc.
* Stimulate economic development, job creation and livelihood opportunities while addressing the issues of the social stigma and operator health and safety issues that continue to impact informal workers.

FSM programs can be drivers of [[sanitation]] improvement in different ways. They can encourage OSSF upgrades that reduce (or increase) the frequency of desludging and therefore the operational and environmental costs. They can also be drivers of economic development all along the sanitation value chain. This can include provision of materials and parts for new toilets and septic tanks; contractors and equipment installers; sludge collection personal including drivers and emptiers; treatment and reuse systems operators; and production and sale of the end-products of the sludge treatment process.

These products may include recycled water for agriculture and industry, soil conditioners, biogas, biodiesel or electricity. There are many pilot, demonstration and full-scale FSM programs now operating in Asia and Africa, but few that have demonstrated a sustained impact upon the value chain.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== Elements of successful programs ===
[[File:Desludging truck in action Nepal.jpg|thumb|Desludging truck ([[vacuum truck]]) in action in Nepal]]
FSM services can be provided as demand based (often called on-request, on-call, on-demand, ad-hoc or non-scheduled) or scheduled (also known as regular) desludging, or a combination of both. Under either mechanism, OSSFs are desludged on a periodic basis or when the household requests it or due to inspection by a competent authority indicates desludging is needed.

An analysis of 20 FSM Innovation Case Studies and research and advocacy of successful programs carried out by [[Oxfam]] Philippines has demonstrated that common elements for successful FSM programs include:&lt;ref name="blackett2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Well formulated and practical policy, rules and regulation: While these are essential they are almost useless, even counterproductive, on their own, and must be supported by complementary factors such as those below;
* Local leadership and clearly mandated and resourced institutions to manage services, even where actual services are delivered by the private sector;
* Partnerships between stakeholders contributes to developing services at scale, building community confidence and achieving sustainability;
* A sustained program of community engagement, marketing and awareness raising is as essential to FSM as sludge treatment – but is frequently under-valued, under-budgeted and sometimes abandoned after an initial period;
* Capacity-building for FSM service providers helps ensure that they can effectively meet all segments of demand and achieve long-term viability. This may include training in both technical matters and business management, and the facilitation of capital formation through grants, equipment leasing, loan guarantees and other financial instruments;
* Tariffs that are pro-poor and representative of operational costs for providing the service;
* Technology that is appropriate to the capacity to operate and maintain the system and the realities of the value chain.

=== Characteristics of fecal sludge ===
Fecal sludge (FS) is the [[human waste]], [[wastewater]], trash and debris that accumulates in [[pit latrine]]s and [[septic tank]]s or other onsite sanitation systems.&lt;ref name="tilley"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eawag.ch/en/department/sandec/publications/compendium/|title=Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies|last2=Ulrich|first2=Lukas|last3=Lüthi|first3=Christoph|last4=Reymond|first4=Philippe|last5=Zurbrügg|first5=Chris|publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag)|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|edition=2nd|location=Duebendorf, Switzerland|last1=Tilley|first1=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fecal sludge is an offensive material that contains [[pathogen]]s, can generate odors and cause surface [[water pollution]], as well as [[groundwater pollution]]. Characteristics of fecal sludge may vary widely due to climate, toilet type, diet and other variables. Performing a waste characterization study to understand local conditions provides data that factors into treatment plant sizing, as well as estimating the value of the products that can be derived from the treatment process.

The main physico-chemical parameters commonly measured to characterize fecal sludge include:{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]], [[total suspended solids]], % solids, indication of sand, [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]], [[ammonium]], total nitrogen and total phosphorus, Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG), [[Sludge volume index|Sludge Volume Index]] (SVI), pH, [[alkalinity]].

System designers often use default values, such as 2,000&amp;nbsp;mg/l for BOD and 5,000&amp;nbsp;mg/l of TSS (which might be an average country-wide) in order to size the treatment system. If no such data exists, or if local conditions are not adequately reflected in assumed values, a waste characterization study can be conducted.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Relatively little data exists on [[pathogen]] content in fecal sludge. One study from rural Bangladesh determined 41 [[Helminths|helminth eggs]] per g of fecal sludge from pit latrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balasubramanya|first=Soumya|last2=Evans|first2=Barbara|last3=Ahmed|first3=Rizwan|last4=Habib|first4=Ahasan|last5=Asad|first5=N. S. M.|last6=Vuong|first6=Luan|last7=Rahman|first7=Mominur|last8=Hasan|first8=Mahmudul|last9=Dey|first9=Digbijoy|date=2016-09-01|title=Pump it up: making single-pit emptying safer in rural Bangladesh|url=http://washdev.iwaponline.com/content/6/3/456|journal=Journal of Water Sanitation and Hygiene for Development|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=456–464|doi=10.2166/washdev.2016.049|issn=2043-9083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of fecal sludge may be influenced by:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Methods, techniques and the skill levels of personnel conducting the desludging;
* The efficiency of the different types of equipment used in desludging;
* Seasonality - presence of groundwater or flood water that may infiltrate into tanks and dilute the contents;
* The last time the tank was desludged (age of fecal sludge).
More research into conducting waste characterization studies in developing countries is needed. For developed countries, more data is available.&lt;ref&gt;Bilhimer, D. (2001) [https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/publications/0107007.pdf Washington State Septage Characterization Analysis], Washington State Department of Ecology, Solid Waste &amp; Financial Assistance Program&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current practice==

===Cities===
[[File:Desludging fleet Manila Water.jpg|thumb|Fleet of [[vacuum truck]]s used for desludging services by Manila Water in Manila, Philippines]]
FSM is a critical sanitation service in cities and towns in all countries where households use onsite sanitation systems.&lt;ref&gt;Peal, A., Evans, B., Blackett, I., Hawkins, P., Heymans, C. (2015). [http://Engaging%20the%20stakeholders%20early%20on%20will%20help%20the%20implements%20to%20craft%20programs%20that%20serve%20each%20socioeconomic%20sector%20of%20the%20society. A Review of Fecal Sludge Management in 12 Cities] - (Final Draft). World Bank - Water and Sanitation Program&lt;/ref&gt; Citywide FSM programs may utilize multiple or one treatment facility, use stationary and mobile transfer stations, and engage with micro, small and medium-sized enterprises that may conduct some or all of the services.&lt;ref name="blackett2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2760|title=FSM Innovation Case Studies - Case Studies on the Business, Policy and Technology of Faecal Sludge Management|last=Blackett|first=I.|last2=Hawkins|first2=P.|publisher=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation|year=2017|isbn=978-1-5136-2513-3|location=Seattle, USA|pages=4–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|99}} Programs may be phased in over time to accommodate growing demand.

===Peri urban areas===
Peri urban areas are often less densely populated than urban centers. Therefore they have more space and on-site sanitation systems can be effective for solid and liquid treatment. In most such peri-urban areas, it is less likely that they will be connected to a conventional centralized sanitary sewer system in the short or medium term. Therefore, these areas will rely on a mix of onsite-sanitation systems and services, decentralized wastewater management systems, or by condominial or [[simplified sewerage]] connected to decentralized or centralized treatment. In all of these situations, FSM is a necessary service to keep the sanitation systems functioning properly.

===Rural areas===
[[File:Passing the faecal sludge to the top of the pit latrine.jpg|thumb|Bad practice example: A worker removing fecal sludge out of the pit of a [[pit latrine]] without wearing any [[personal protective equipment]] (in a village in [[Burkina Faso]]). ]]
Rural areas with low population density may not need formal FSM services if the local practice is to cover and rebuild latrines when they fill up. However, this if is not possible, rural areas often lack treatment facilities within a reasonable (say 30 minutes drive) distance; are difficult for tankers to access and often have limited demand for emptying making transport and treatment uneconomic, and unaffordable for most people. Therefore options such as relocating latrines on-site, double (alternating) pit or [[Arborloo]] toilets could be considered. Also sharing decentralized FSM services and sludge treatment between nearby villages, or direct safe removal burial of waste could be considered and organized.

== Design considerations ==

===Selecting the operator of FSM services===

FSM services are usually provided by formal and informal private sector service providers, local governments, water authorities and [[Public utility|utilities]]. Water utilities with a high percentage of water connectivity (homes with piped water connections) are logical operators of FSM programs. If water is sold to customers through a tariff, an additional tariff to cover FSM services may be added. For larger cities, it is usually the water and sewerage service provider that will be the most appropriate operator.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Local governments may choose to provide services by using their own staff and resources for collection, transportation and treatment. This is often the case in smaller cities or municipalities where the water utility may not have a broad reach. In many cases, cooperation between the city government and the water utility may be strategically advantageous. Dumaguete City, Philippines is one example where the Water District (utility) and Local Government have joint ownership and responsibilities for the FSM program.&lt;ref&gt;City Septage Management Program a Galing Pook, Youtube video (2013): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDOnMPP-nIQ , City Planning and Devt. Office Dumaguete City, Philippines
&lt;/ref&gt; Organized larger scale FSM programs may be able to provide the service more cheaply and more hygienically than the independent private operators working on an ''ad hoc'' basis. Ensuring services are affordable is an important selling point when promoting the program to citizens and encouraging them to participate.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The local private sector is an important player in providing FSM services. In such cases, private sector contractors may work directly for households (under regulation) or bid on desludging contracts let by the city. The private sector can also provide services in operating and maintaining the treatment works, and in processing and selling the commodities resulting from the treatment process. San Fernando City, La Union, Philippines is an example of a local government that has contracted out the treatment facility construction and collection program to the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psa.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=128&amp;Itemid=81|title=USAID-Rotary San Fernando City Sewerage and Septage Management Project|last=|first=|date=21 October 2010|website=|publisher=USAID Philippine Sanitation Alliance|access-date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synergy with other programs ===
FSM is but one aspect of citywide sanitation that also includes: 
* [[Municipal solid waste]] management;
* Drainage and [[greywater]] management; 
* Wastewater collection and treatment including effluent overflows from on-site systems where soils based dispersal systems are insufficient to assimilate the volume; 
* Water safety; and
* Food safety.  
There are important synergies between many of these services and FSM, and investigating co-management opportunities can yield benefits. MSW can often be co-managed with fecal waste, especially when thermal treatment technologies are used. Food waste from restaurants and markets can be co-composted with fecal waste to produce a high value soils amendment. Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG) from commercial grease traps can be added to biodigesters to increase methane production, or used in conjunction with fecal sludge as a feedstock for biodiesel production.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Robbins, Owen George, Rachel Burton (2011) [http://www.rti.org/sites/default/files/resources/managing_fats_oil_and_grease_for_local_governments_in_india.pdf Developing Programs to Manage Fats, Oil, and Grease (FOG) for Local Governments in India], VthWorld Aqua Congress—New Delhi, India, November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water supply]] is also closely linked with FSM as it is often the water utility that will manage programs and their customers that will pay for services through tariffs.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== Scheduled desludging programs ===
In Southeast Asia, there is increasing interest in scheduled desludging programs as a means of providing services. Under this scheme, users pay monthly tariffs that are included with their water bill to cover the cost of services. The trucks move from neighborhood to neighborhood on a scheduled cycle. Truck operators are licensed and compensated based on the volume of waste delivered to the treatment plant, which serves as an incentive against illegal dumping. The concept was first introduced in the Philippines in 2010 and has been replicated there successfully.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Co-treatment at wastewater treatment plants ===
Co-treatment of septage at [[Wastewater treatment|wastewater treatment plants]] is the method of choice for cities where almost all households have access to [[sewerage]]. In those situations the volume of septage is small in comparison with that of wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.developmentbookshelf.com/doi/book/10.3362/9781780449869|title=Faecal Sludge and Septage Treatment|last=Tayler|first=Kevin|date=|publisher=Practical Action Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9781853399862|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.3362/9781780449869}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

== Technology components and infrastructure ==

===Technology selection===
[[File:Training of enumerators for septage survey Nepal.jpg|thumb|Training of enumerators for a survey regarding fecal sludge management needs in Nepal]]
A formal process should be used for making an informed technology selection for the treatment of the fecal sludge.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is usually ''a'' collaborative process conducted by stakeholders, consultants, the operator and the future owner of the facility''.'' The process is based on a long term vision planning with stakeholders as part of citywide sanitation planning. The expected waste flows (volume), their strength, characteristics, and variability in each area need to be known. A formal and transparent process for developing appropriate plans and designs for wastewater and fecal sludge treatment plants will achieve local buy-in and ownership of technology decisions, which is critical for the long term success and sustainability of the program.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Collection vehicles and equipment===
{{Further|Vacuum truck}}
[[File:Fig.1. Gulper used to desludge tanks in eThekwini, South Africa.JPG|thumb|The "Gulper", a device for manual pumping of fecal sludge from pits used in eThekwini ([[Durban]]), South Africa.]]

If the fecal sludge is liquid enough, it is usually collected by using vacuum pumps or centrifugal style booster pumps. A variety of manual and motorized devices designed to excavate thick and viscous sludge and accumulated trash are also available in the market.

After sitting for years in septic tanks and pit latrines, the accumulated sludge becomes hardened and is very difficult to remove. It is still common that workers enter pits in order to desludge them, even though this practice is generally unsafe and undesirable (in India, this practice is called "[[manual scavenging]]"). A number of low-cost pumping systems exist to remove this hardened sludge hygienically from the ground surface, although many of them are still in the experimental stage (e.g. Excravator, Gulper, e-Vac).&lt;ref name="Still2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Still|first1=David|last2=Foxon|first2=Kitty|title=Tackling the challenges of full pit latrines : report to the Water Research Commission|date=2012|publisher=Water Research Commission|location=Gezina [South Africa]|isbn=9781431202935|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fecal sludge can also be treated inside the tank or pit as well, by use of the "in-pit lime stabilization process", which treats the waste before it is removed from the tank or pit. This methodology was first pioneered by iDE Cambodia in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;iDE Cambodia (2013) Treating waste with lime, Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDGefsKq8vM
&lt;/ref&gt; Once removed, it is transported to onsite or off site treatment and processing facilities.

Some advanced transfer stations and vacuum trucks can dewater fecal sludge to some extent, and this water may be placed in sewer lines to be treated in wastewater treatment plants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This allows more sludge to be dealt with more efficiently and may constitute one of the best cases of co-treatment of fecal sludge in wastewater treatment plants.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Transfer stations===
 
Transfer stations are intermediary drop off locations often used where treatment facilities are located too far away from population centers to make direct disposal feasible. In other locations, traffic concerns or local truck bans during daylight hours may make transfer stations feasible. In addition, municipalities where a significant percentage of homes cannot be accessed by tanker truck should utilize transfer stations. Transfer stations are used if:

* More than 5% of the homes are inaccessible by a vacuum truck;
* The treatment plant is too far away from the homes for transport in one haul to be practical;
* Trucks are not permitted on the streets during the day; or
* Heavy traffic during daylight hours impedes the movement of vacuum trucks.

==== Mobile transfer stations ====
Mobile transfer stations are nothing more than larger tanker trucks or trailers that are deployed along with small vacuum trucks and motorcycle or hand carts. The smaller vehicles discharge to the larger tanker, which then carries the collected sludge to the treatment plant. These work well in scheduled desludging business models.

==== Fixed transfer stations ====
Fixed transfer stations are dedicated facilities installed strategically throughout the municipality that serve as drop off locations for collected fecal sludge. They may include a receiving station with screens, a tank for holding the collected waste, trash storage containers, and wash down facilities. These may be more appropriate for FSM programs using the "call-for-service" business model.

While static transfer stations are fixed tanks, mobile transfer stations are simply tanker trucks or trailers that work alongside the SVVs and actually do the longer haul transferring of the waste from the community to the treatment plant. Mobile transfer stations work best for scheduled desludging programs where there are no traffic restrictions or truck bans, and a relatively large number of homes that are inaccessible to the larger vehicles.

===Treatment plants===
[[File:Sand drying bed for emergency septage treatment Oxfam Philippines.jpg|thumb|Drying bed for emergency fecal sludge treatment by [[Oxfam]] in the Philippines]]
[[File:Sand drying bed Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|Drying bed for fecal sludge in Bangladesh]]
Fecal Sludge is often processed through a series of treatment steps to first separate the liquids from the solids, and then treat both the liquid and solid trains while recovering as much of the energy or nutritive value as possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Common processes at fecal sludge treatment plants include:

* Fecal sludge reception - where the truck interfaces with the treatment plant and sludge is unloaded. 
* Preliminary treatment - to remove garbage, sand, grit, and FOG (fats, oil and grease);
* Primary treatment - simple separation by physical means, or separation with microbial digestion;
* Liquids treatment - for example by using [[constructed wetlands]], [[Stabilization pond|waste stabilization ponds]], [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic digesters]]; and 
* Solids processing - using the solids resulting from fecal sludge treatment for beneficial use where possible.

Constructed wetlands are gaining attention as a low-cost treatment technology that can be constructed in many instances using local materials and labor. For sites with enough land and a ready supply of gravel and sand, this technology offers low cost, scalability, and simple operation.&lt;ref&gt;Thammarat Koottatep, Chongrak Polprasert and Nguyen Thi Kim Oanh, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228581103_Design_considerations_of_constructed_wetlands_for_septage_treatment_at_the_AIT_pilot_plant Design considerations of constructed wetlands for septage treatment at the AIT pilot plant]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Drying beds ====
Simple sludge drying beds can be used, as they are a cheap and simple method to dry fecal sludge (they are also widely used to dry [[sewage sludge]]). Drainage water must be captured; drying beds are sometimes covered but usually left uncovered. 

Drying beds are typically composed of four layers consisting of gravel and sand. The first layer is coarse gravel that is 15 to 20 centimeters thick. Followed by fine gravel that is 10 centimeters thick. The third layer is sand that can be between 10 to 15 centimeters and serves as the filter between the sludge and gravel. Sludge dries up and water percolates to the first layer that is collected at the drainage pipe that is beneath all layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KsWLsxWZJk|title=Introduction to Faecal Sludge Management, Unplanted drying beds|last=Gold|first=Moritz|date=|website=youtube.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Emerging technologies ====
Emerging technologies for fecal sludge treatment include:&lt;ref name="Diener"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diener|first1=Stefan|last2=Semiyaga|first2=Swaib|last3=Niwagaba|first3=Charles B.|last4=Muspratt|first4=Ashley Murray|last5=Gning|first5=Jean Birane|last6=Mbéguéré|first6=Mbaye|last7=Ennin|first7=Joseph Effah|last8=Zurbrugg|first8=Christian|last9=Strande|first9=Linda|title=A value proposition: Resource recovery from faecal sludge—Can it be the driver for improved sanitation?|journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|date=July 2014|volume=88|pages=32–38|doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.04.005|url=http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2025}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Thermal processes which can achieve cost effectiveness by eliminating the need for separate processes. They convert the fecal sludge along with certain fractions of [[sewage sludge]] or municipal solid waste to produce energy or fuel by using certain [[sewage sludge treatment]] technologies.
* Biodiesel can be manufactured by using fats, oils and grease as feedstocks. Research by [[RTI International]] is being conducted to use fecal sludge for biodiesel production.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}  
* Electricity can be produced by thermal processes that burn fecal and solid waste together to maintain stable combustion and the heat is used to make steam that drives generators.

===Treatment products and reuse options===
[[File:Sludge pellets after LaDePa process (8151957937).jpg|thumb|Sludge pellets after processing (including heating, drying and pelletizing) in a LaDePa process, eThekwini Municipality (South Africa)]]

[[Compost]]ing is a process whereby organic matter is digested in the presence of oxygen with the byproduct of heat. For fecal sludge, the heat deactivates the pathogens while the digestion process breaks down the organic matter into a humus-like material that acts as a soils amendment, and nutrients that are broken down into a form that is more easily taken up by plants. Properly treated fecal sludge can be reused in agriculture (see also [[reuse of excreta]]).

Fecal sludge is rich in nitrogen. When they are mixed with materials that are rich in carbon, such as shredded crop wastes, the composting process can be maximized. Proper mixture to achieve a ratio of 20 to 1 to 30 to 1 of carbon to nitrogen is best.

[[Biogas]] is a byproduct of the anaerobic digestion process.

Treated effluent can be used for agricultural or landscape [[irrigation]].

These by-products have the potential to offset some of the costs of the program, thereby reducing tariffs for the public. However, value addition all the way to biogas, biodiesel and electricity is difficult to achieve in practice due to technological and operational challenges.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Costs and fees ==
FSM is considered an entry point for sanitation improvement programs that are led by local governments. Such programs may include tariffs or user fees, promotions campaigns to raise the willingness to pay for the service, and local ordinances that define the rules and regulations governing FSM. In the Philippines, tariffs around $1 USD per family per month are generally enough to achieve full cost recovery within a period of 3 to 7 years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Promotional campaigns are used to raise the willingness to pay for services, and local procedures and ordinances provide additional incentives for compliance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3113">A '''field-replaceable unit''' (FRU)&lt;ref name=Newton16p364/&gt; is a [[printed circuit board]], part, or assembly that can be quickly and easily removed from a [[computer]] or other piece of electronic equipment, and replaced by the user or a technician without having to send the entire product or system to a repair facility. FRUs allow a technician lacking in-depth product knowledge to [[fault detection and isolation|isolate faults]] and replace faulty components.

For example, in military aviation, electronic components of [[line-replaceable unit]]s, typically known as [[shop-replaceable unit]]s (SRUs), are repaired at field-service [[backshop]]s, usually by a "remove and replace" repair procedure, with specialized repair performed at centralized depot or by the [[original equipment manufacturer|OEM]].

==History==
Many [[vacuum tube]] computers had FRUs:
*[[Pluggable unit]]s containing one or more [[vacuum tube]]s and various [[passive component]]s

Most [[transistor]]ized and [[integrated circuit]]-based computers had FRUs:
*[[Computer module]]s, circuit boards containing discrete transistors and various passive components. Examples:
**[[IBM Standard Modular System|IBM SMS cards]]
**[[System Building Blocks|DEC System Building Blocks]] cards
**[[Flip Chip (PDP module)|DEC Flip-Chip]] cards
*Circuit boards containing monolithic ICs and/or [[hybrid integrated circuit|hybrid ICs]], such as [[IBM Solid Logic Technology|IBM SLT cards]].

Vacuum tubes themselves are usually FRUs.

For a short period starting in the late 1960s, some [[television set]] manufacturers made solid-state televisions with FRUs instead of a single board attached to the chassis. However modern televisions put all the electronics on one large board to reduce manufacturing costs.

==Trends==
As the sophistication and complexity of multi-replaceable unit electronics in both commercial and consumer industries have increased, many design and manufacturing organizations have expanded the use of the FRU storage device. Storage is no longer limited to simply identification of the FRU itself, but now also comprises back-up copies of critical system information such as system serial numbers, MAC address and even security information. Some systems will fail to function at all without each FRU in the system being ratified at start-up. Today one cannot assume that the FRU storage device is only used to maintain the FRU ID of the part.

The '''global atmospheric electrical circuit''' is the course of continuous movement of [[atmospheric electricity]] between the [[ionosphere]] and the [[earth's surface|Earth]]. Through [[solar radiation]], [[lightning|thunderstorms]], and the '''fair-weather condition''', the atmosphere is subject to a continual and substantial [[electrical current]].

Principally, [[thunderstorm]]s throughout the world carry ''negative'' charges to the earth, which is then discharged gradually through the air in fair weather.&lt;ref name="Feynman"/&gt;

This atmospheric circuit is central to the study of [[atmospheric physics]] and [[meteorology]]. It is used in the [[Weather forecasting|prediction of thunderstorms,]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.missioninstruments.com/pages/learning/elec_fields.html|title=Mission Instruments: Electric Fields|website=www.missioninstruments.com|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was central to the [[History of electromagnetic theory|understanding of electricity]]. In the past it has been suggested as a source of [[Free energy suppression conspiracy theory|available energy,]] or [[World Wireless System|communications platform]].

The global electrical circuit is also applied to the study [[Air ionization therapy|human health]] and [[air pollution]], due of the interaction of negative ions and [[aerosol]]s. The effect of [[global warming]], and temperature-sensitivity of the Earth's electrical circuit is unknown.&lt;ref name="nasa"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Tesla Broadcast Tower 1904.jpeg|200px|thumb|right|The [[Wardenclyffe Tower|Wardenclyffe Power Plant]] attempted to use the earth's electrical circuit for telecommunications]]
In the 18th century, scientists began understanding the link between [[lightning]] and electricity. In addition to the iconic [[kite experiment]]s of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Thomas-François Dalibard]], some early studies of electric charges in a "cloudless atmosphere" were done by [[John Canton]], [[Giovanni Battista Beccaria|Giambatista Beccaria]], and [[John Read (inventor)|John Read]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennett|first=A. J.|last2=Harrison|first2=R. G.|date=2007-10-01|title=Atmospheric electricity in different weather conditions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wea.97/abstract|journal=Weather|language=en|volume=62|issue=10|pages=277–283|doi=10.1002/wea.97|issn=1477-8696|bibcode=2007Wthr...62..277B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1752, [[Louis-Guillaume Le Monnier]] observed electrification in fair weather. Various others performed measurements throughout the late 18th century, often finding consistent diurnal variations. During the 19th century, several long series of observations were made. Measurements near cities were heavily influenced by smoke pollution. In the early 20th century, balloon ascents provided information about the [[electric field]] in the [[upper atmosphere]]. Important work was done by the research vessel [[Carnegie (ship)|Carnegie]], which produced standardised measurements around the world's oceans (where the air is relatively clean).

[[C. T. R. Wilson]] was the first to present a theory of a global circuit in 1920.

==Mechanism==

=== Lightning ===
{{main|Lightning}}
[[Lightning]] strikes the earth 40,000 times per day,&lt;ref name="Feynman"&gt;[http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_09.html Electricity in the Atmosphere - Feynman Lectures]&lt;/ref&gt; and can be thought to charge the earth like a battery. Thunderstorms generate an [[electrical potential difference]] between the earth's surface and the ionosphere, mainly by means of lightning. Because of this, the ionosphere is positively charged relative to the earth.
Consequently, there is always a small current transporting [[charged particle]]s between the ionosphere and the surface.

=== Fair weather condition===
This current is carried by a small number of [[ion]]s present in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] (generated mainly by [[cosmic ray]]s in the upper atmosphere, and by [[radioactivity]] near the surface).
Different locations, and meteorological conditions on the earth can have different [[electrical conductivity]]. Fair weather condition describes the state of [[atmospheric electricity]] where air carries this electrical current between the earth and the [[ionosphere]].

== Measurement ==
The [[voltage]]s involved in the Earth's circuit are significant. At [[sea level]], the typical potential [[gradient]] in fair weather is 120&amp;nbsp;V/m. Nonetheless, since the [[Electric conductivity|conductivity]] of air is limited, the associated currents are also limited. A typical value is 1800&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere|A]] over the entire planet.
When it is not rainy or stormy, the amount of electricity within the atmosphere is typically between 1000 and 1800 amps. In fair weather conditions, there are about 3.5 microamps per square kilometer (9 microamps per square mile).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2006/TerryMathew.shtml|title=Electric Current through the Atmosphere - The Physics Factbook|last=Elert|first=Glenn|website=hypertextbook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can produce a 200+ volt difference between the head and feet of a regular person.

Local turbulence, winds, and other fluctuations also cause small variations in the fair weather electric field, causing the fair-weather condition to be partially regional.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1999/essd15jun99_1|title=Soaking in atmospheric electricity {{!}} Science Mission Directorate|website=science.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Carnegie curve ===
The Earth's electrical current varies according to a daily pattern called the Carnegie curve, believed to be caused by the regular daily variations in atmospheric electrification associated with the earth's weather regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harrison|first=R. Giles|date=2013-03-01|title=The Carnegie Curve|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10712-012-9210-2|journal=Surveys in Geophysics|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=209–232|doi=10.1007/s10712-012-9210-2|issn=0169-3298|bibcode=2013SGeo...34..209H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern also shows seasonal variation, linked to the earth's solstices and equinoxes. It was named after the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32909">'''Habitat destruction''' is the process by which natural [[habitat]] is rendered incapable of supporting its native species. In this process, the organisms that previously used the site are displaced or destroyed, reducing [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/12/1079 | author= Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. &amp; Falcon-Lang, H.J. | year=2010 | title= Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euram     eri                 ca | journal=Geology | volume = 38 | pages = 1079–1082 | format=PDF | doi=10.1130/G31182.1 | issue=12 | bibcode=2010Geo....38.1079S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habitat destruction by human activity is mainly for the purpose of harvesting [[natural resources]] for industrial production and [[urbanization]]. Clearing habitats for [[agriculture]] is the principal cause of habitat destruction. Other important causes of habitat destruction include [[mining]], [[logging]], [[trawling]], and [[urban sprawl]]. Habitat destruction is currently ranked as the primary cause of species [[extinction]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Pimm &amp; Raven, 2000, pp. 843-845&lt;/ref&gt; It is a process of natural environmental change that may be caused by [[habitat fragmentation]], geological processes, [[climate change]]&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt; or by human activities such as the introduction of [[invasive species]], ecosystem nutrient depletion, and other human activities.

The terms '''habitat loss''' and '''habitat reduction''' are also used in a wider sense, including loss of habitat from other factors, such as [[water pollution|water]] and [[noise pollution]].

==Impacts on organisms==
In the simplest term, when a habitat is destroyed, the plants, animals, and other organisms that occupied the habitat have a reduced [[carrying capacity]] so that populations decline and [[extinction]] becomes more likely.&lt;ref&gt;Scholes &amp; Biggs, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the greatest threat to organisms and biodiversity is the process of habitat loss.&lt;ref&gt;Barbault &amp; Sastrapradja, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Temple (1986) found that 82% of [[Endangered species|endangered bird species]] were significantly threatened by habitat loss. Most amphibian species are also threatened by habitat loss,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beebee|first1=Trevor J.C.|last2=Griffiths|first2=Richard A.|title=The amphibian decline crisis: A watershed for conservation biology?|journal=Biological Conservation|date=31 May 2005|volume=125|issue=3|page=271|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2005.04.009|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320705001825}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some species are now only breeding in modified habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borzée|first1=Amaël|last2=Jang|first2=Yikweon|title=Description of a seminatural habitat of the endangered Suweon treefrog Hyla suweonensis|journal=Animal Cells and Systems|date=28 April 2015|volume=19|issue=3|page=216|doi=10.1080/19768354.2015.1028442|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19768354.2015.1028442}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[endemism|Endemic]] organisms with limited ranges are most affected by habitat destruction, mainly because these organisms are not found anywhere else within the world, and thus have less chance of recovering. Many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem, resulting in their extinction. Extinction may also take place very long after the destruction of habitat, a phenomenon known as [[extinction debt]]. Habitat destruction can also decrease the range of certain organism populations. This can result in the reduction of genetic diversity and perhaps the production of [[infertile]] youths, as these organisms would have a higher possibility of mating with related organisms within their population, or different species. One of the most famous examples is the impact upon China's [[giant panda]], once found across the nation. Now it is only found in fragmented and isolated regions in the southwest of the country, as a result of widespread [[deforestation]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/china-sichuan-panda-deforestation-habitat-mountain-conservation|title=The Panda's Forest: Biodiversity Loss|date=24 August 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Bolivia-Deforestation-EO.JPG|thumb|right|Satellite photograph of [[deforestation in Bolivia]]. Originally dry tropical forest, the land is being cleared for [[soybean]] cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Biodiversity hotspot]]s are chiefly [[tropical]] regions that feature high concentrations of [[Endemism|endemic]] species and, when all hotspots are combined, may contain over half of the world’s [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] species.&lt;ref name="Cincotta"&gt;Cincotta &amp; Engelman, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; These hotspots are suffering from habitat loss and destruction.
Most of the natural habitat on islands and in areas of high human population density has already been destroyed (WRI, 2003). Islands suffering extreme habitat destruction include [[New Zealand]], [[Madagascar]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Primack"&gt;Primack, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; South and East Asia — especially [[China]], [[India]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and Japan — and many areas in [[West Africa]] have extremely dense human populations that allow little room for natural habitat. Marine areas close to highly populated [[coast]]al cities also face degradation of their [[coral reef]]s or other marine habitat. These areas include the eastern coasts of Asia and Africa, northern coasts of [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean Sea]] and its associated [[island]]s.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

Regions of un[[sustainable agriculture]] or unstable governments, which may go hand-in-hand, typically experience high rates of habitat destruction.  [[Central America]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and the [[Amazonian tropical rainforest]] areas of [[South America]] are the main regions with unsustainable agricultural practices and/or government mismanagement.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

Areas of high agricultural output tend to have the highest extent of habitat destruction.  In the U.S., less than 25% of native vegetation remains in many parts of the [[Eastern United States|East]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;Stein et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Only 15% of land area remains unmodified by human activities in all of Europe.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

==Ecosystems==
[[File:Lacanja burn.JPG|thumb|Jungle burned for agriculture in southern Mexico]]
[[Tropical rainforest]]s have received most of the attention concerning the destruction of habitat. From the approximately 16 million square kilometers of tropical rainforest habitat that originally existed worldwide, less than 9 million square kilometers remain today.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; The current rate of [[deforestation]] is 160,000 square kilometers per year, which equates to a loss of approximately 1% of original forest habitat each year.&lt;ref name="Laurance"&gt;Laurance, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forest [[ecosystem]]s have suffered as much or more destruction as tropical [[rainforest]]s.  [[Farming]] and [[logging]] have severely disturbed at least 94% of [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate broadleaf forests]]; many [[old growth forest]] stands have lost more than 98% of their previous area because of human activities.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|Tropical deciduous dry forests]] are easier to [[Slash and burn|clear and burn]] and are more suitable for agriculture and [[cattle ranching]] than tropical rainforests; consequently, less than 0.1% of [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry forests in Central America's Pacific Coast]] and less than 8% in [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|Madagascar]] remain from their original extents.&lt;ref name="Laurance"/&gt;

[[File:Farmland-batang bungo.jpg|thumb|left|Farmers near newly cleared land within Taman Nasional Kerinci Seblat ([[Kerinci Seblat National Park]]), [[Sumatra]].]]
Plains and [[desert]] areas have been degraded to a lesser extent. Only 10-20% of the world's [[drylands]], which include [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]], [[Scrubland|scrub]], and [[Temperate deciduous forest|deciduous forests]], have been somewhat degraded.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman &amp; Pyke, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  But included in that 10-20% of land is the approximately 9 million square kilometers of seasonally dry-lands that humans have converted to deserts through the process of desertification.&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; The [[tallgrass prairie]]s of North America, on the other hand, have less than 3% of natural habitat remaining that has not been converted to farmland.&lt;ref&gt;White et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wetland]]s and marine areas have endured high levels of habitat destruction. More than 50% of wetlands in the U.S. have been destroyed in just the last 200 years.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt; Between 60% and 70% of European wetlands have been completely destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Ravenga et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, there has been an increase in demand for coastal housing and tourism which has caused a decline in marine habitats over the last 60 years. The rising sea levels and temperatures have caused [[soil erosion]], [[coastal flooding]], and loss of quality in the UK [[marine ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azocleantech.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=535|title=United Kingdom: Environmental Issues, Policies and Clean Technology|date=2015-06-08|website=AZoCleantech.com|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one-fifth (20%) of marine coastal areas have been highly modified by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Burke et al., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; One-fifth of coral reefs have also been destroyed, and another fifth has been severely degraded by [[overfishing]], pollution, and [[invasive species]]; 90% of the Philippines’ coral reefs alone have been destroyed.&lt;ref name="MEA"&gt;MEA, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, over 35% of the [[Coastal ecosystems|mangrove ecosystems]] worldwide have been destroyed.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;

==Natural causes==
Habitat destruction through natural processes such as volcanism, [[fire]], and climate change is well documented in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt; One study shows that habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity, but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;

==Human causes==
[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|Deforestation and roads in Amazonia, the [[Amazon Rainforest]].]]

Habitat destruction caused by humans includes [[land conversion]] from forests, etc. to [[arable land]], [[urban sprawl]], [[Public works|infrastructure development]], and other anthropogenic changes to the characteristics of land. Habitat degradation, fragmentation, and [[pollution]] are aspects of habitat destruction caused by humans that do not necessarily involve over destruction of habitat, yet result in habitat collapse. [[Desertification]], [[deforestation]], and [[Coral bleaching|coral reef degradation]] are specific types of habitat destruction for those areas ([[desert]]s, [[forest]]s, [[coral reef]]s).

Geist and Lambin (2002) assessed 152 case studies of net losses of tropical forest cover to determine any patterns in the proximate and underlying causes of tropical deforestation. Their results, yielded as percentages of the case studies in which each parameter was a significant factor, provide a quantitative prioritization of which proximate and underlying causes were the most significant. The proximate causes were clustered into broad categories of [[agricultural expansion]] (96%), [[infrastructure expansion]] (72%), and [[wood extraction]] (67%). Therefore, according to this study, [[forest conversion]] to agriculture is the main land use change responsible for tropical deforestation. The specific categories reveal further insight into the specific causes of tropical deforestation: transport extension (64%), commercial wood extraction (52%), [[permanent cultivation]] (48%), [[cattle ranching]] (46%), shifting ([[slash and burn]]) cultivation (41%), [[subsistence agriculture]] (40%), and [[fuel wood]] extraction for domestic use (28%). One result is that [[shifting cultivation]] is not the primary cause of deforestation in all world regions, while transport extension (including the [[Road construction|construction of new roads]]) is the largest single proximate factor responsible for deforestation.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt;

Rising global temperatures, caused by the [[greenhouse effect]], contribute to habitat destruction, endangering various species, such as the [[polar bear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Predicting 21st-century polar bear habitat distribution from global climate models|url=|journal=Ecological Monographs|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1890/07-2089.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melting [[ice cap]]s promote rising sea levels and floods which threaten natural habitats and species globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Jason D.|last2=Littnan|first2=Charles L.|last3=Johnston|first3=David W.|date=2006-05-24|title=Potential effects of sea level rise on the terrestrial habitats of endangered and endemic megafauna in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v2/p21-30/|journal=Endangered Species Research|volume=2|pages=21–30|doi=10.3354/esr002021|issn=1863-5407}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galbraith|first=H.|last2=Jones|first2=R.|last3=Park|first3=R.|last4=Clough|first4=J.|last5=Herrod-Julius|first5=S.|last6=Harrington|first6=B.|last7=Page|first7=G.|date=2002-06-01|title=Global Climate Change and Sea Level Rise: Potential Losses of Intertidal Habitat for Shorebirds|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1675/1524-4695%282002%29025%5B0173%3AGCCASL%5D2.0.CO%3B2|journal=Waterbirds|volume=25|issue=2|pages=173–183|doi=10.1675/1524-4695(2002)025[0173:GCCASL]2.0.CO;2|issn=1524-4695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drivers==
[[File:Crowded Nanjing Road in Shanghai.jpeg|thumb|Nanjing Road in Shanghai]]
While the above-mentioned activities are the proximal or direct causes of habitat destruction in that they actually destroy habitat, this still does not identify why humans destroy habitat.  The forces that cause humans to destroy habitat are known as ''drivers'' of habitat destruction.  [[Demographic]], economic, sociopolitical, scientific and technological, and cultural drivers all contribute to habitat destruction.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;

Demographic drivers include the [[Human overpopulation|expanding human population]]; rate of [[Population growth|population increase]] over time; [[Population density|spatial distribution]] of people in a given area ([[List of urban areas by population|urban]] versus rural), ecosystem type, and country; and the combined effects of poverty, age, family planning, gender, and education status of people in certain areas.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;  Most of the exponential human population growth worldwide is occurring in or close to [[biodiversity hotspots]].&lt;ref name="Cincotta"/&gt;  This may explain why human population density accounts for 87.9% of the variation in numbers of [[threatened species]] across 114 countries, providing indisputable evidence that people play the largest role in decreasing [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;McKee et al., 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The boom in human population and migration of people into such species-rich regions are making [[conservation biology|conservation efforts]] not only more urgent but also more likely to conflict with local human interests.&lt;ref name="Cincotta"/&gt;  The high local population density in such areas is directly correlated to the poverty status of the local people, most of whom lacking an education and family planning.&lt;ref name="Geist"&gt;Geist &amp; Lambin, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Geist and Lambin (2002) study described in the previous section, the underlying driving forces were prioritized as follows (with the percent of the 152 cases the factor played a significant role in): economic factors (81%), institutional or policy factors (78%), technological factors (70%), cultural or socio-political factors (66%), and demographic factors (61%).  The main economic factors included commercialization and growth of timber markets (68%), which are driven by national and international demands; urban industrial growth (38%); low domestic costs for land, labor, fuel, and timber (32%); and increases in product prices mainly for cash crops (25%).  Institutional and policy factors included formal pro-deforestation policies on land development (40%), economic growth including colonization and infrastructure improvement (34%), and subsidies for land-based activities (26%); property rights and land-tenure insecurity (44%); and policy failures such as corruption, lawlessness, or mismanagement (42%).  The main technological factor was the poor application of technology in the wood industry (45%), which leads to wasteful logging practices.  Within the broad category of cultural and sociopolitical factors are public attitudes and values (63%), individual/household behavior (53%), public unconcern toward forest environments (43%), missing basic values (36%), and unconcern by individuals (32%).  Demographic factors were the in-migration of colonizing settlers into sparsely populated forest areas (38%) and growing population density—a result of the first factor—in those areas (25%).

There are also feedbacks and interactions among the proximate and underlying causes of deforestation that can amplify the process. Road construction has the largest feedback effect, because it interacts with—and leads to—the establishment of new settlements and more people, which causes a growth in wood (logging) and food markets.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt;  Growth in these markets, in turn, progresses the commercialization of agriculture and logging industries. When these industries become commercialized, they must become more efficient by utilizing larger or more modern machinery that often has a worse effect on the habitat than traditional farming and logging methods. Either way, more land is cleared more rapidly for commercial markets. This common feedback example manifests just how closely related the proximate and underlying causes are to each other.

==Impact on human population==
[[File:KatrinaNewOrleansFlooded edit2.jpg|thumb|The draining and development of coastal wetlands that previously protected the Gulf Coast contributed to severe flooding in New Orleans, Louisiana in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;Tibbetts, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Habitat destruction vastly increases an area's vulnerability to [[natural disaster]]s like [[flood]] and [[drought]], [[crop failure]], [[spread of disease]], and [[water contamination]].&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; On the other hand, a healthy ecosystem with good management practices will reduce the chance of these events happening, or will at least mitigate adverse impacts.

Agricultural land can actually suffer from the destruction of the surrounding landscape. Over the past 50 years, the destruction of habitat surrounding agricultural land has degraded approximately 40% of agricultural land worldwide via [[erosion]], [[Soil salinity|salinization]], [[Soil compaction|compaction]], [[Natural resource#Depletion|nutrient depletion]], [[pollution]], and [[urbanization]].&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; Humans also lose direct uses of natural habitat when habitat is destroyed. Aesthetic uses such as [[birdwatching]], recreational uses like [[hunting]] and [[fishing]], and [[ecotourism]] usually rely upon virtually undisturbed habitat. Many people value the complexity of the natural world and are disturbed by the loss of natural habitats and animal or plant species worldwide.

Probably the most profound impact that habitat destruction has on people is the loss of many valuable [[ecosystem services]]. Habitat destruction has altered nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and [[carbon cycle]]s, which has increased the frequency and severity of [[acid rain]], [[algal bloom]]s, and [[fish kill]]s in rivers and oceans and contributed tremendously to global [[climate change]].&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; One ecosystem service whose significance is becoming better understood is [[Climate|climate regulation]]. On a local scale, trees provide windbreaks and shade; on a regional scale, [[Transpiration|plant transpiration]] recycles rainwater and maintains constant annual rainfall; on a global scale, plants (especially trees from tropical rainforests) from around the world counter the accumulation of [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere by [[Carbon dioxide sink|sequestering carbon dioxide]] through [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt; Other ecosystem services that are diminished or lost altogether as a result of habitat destruction include [[watershed management]], [[nitrogen fixation]], oxygen production, [[pollination]] (see [[pollinator decline]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=5|year=2013|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0063421|pmc=3661593|title=Plant Pollinator Networks along a Gradient of Urbanisation|author1=Benoît Geslin|author2=Benoit Gauzens|author3=Elisa Thébault|author4=Isabelle Dajoz|pmid=23717421|page=e63421|bibcode=2013PLoSO...863421G}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[waste treatment]] (i.e., the [[Decomposition|breaking down]] and immobilization of [[toxic]] pollutants), and [[Nutrient cycle|nutrient recycling]] of [[sewage]] or [[agricultural runoff]].&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

The loss of trees from the tropical rainforests alone represents a substantial diminishing of the earth’s ability to produce oxygen and use up carbon dioxide. These services are becoming even more important as increasing [[carbon dioxide]] levels is one of the main contributors to global [[climate change]].

The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] may not directly affect humans, but the indirect effects of losing many species as well as the diversity of ecosystems in general are enormous. When biodiversity is lost, the environment loses many species that perform valuable and unique roles in the ecosystem. The environment and all its inhabitants rely on biodiversity to recover from extreme environmental conditions. When too much biodiversity is lost, a catastrophic event such as an earthquake, flood, or volcanic eruption could cause an ecosystem to crash, and humans would obviously suffer from that. Loss of biodiversity also means that humans are losing animals that could have served as biological control agents and plants that could potentially provide higher-yielding crop varieties, pharmaceutical drugs to cure existing or future diseases or cancer, and new resistant crop varieties for agricultural species susceptible to pesticide-resistant insects or virulent strains of [[fungi]], [[virus]]es, and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name="Primack"/&gt;

The negative effects of habitat destruction usually impact rural populations more directly than urban populations.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt; Across the globe, poor people suffer the most when natural habitat is destroyed, because less natural habitat means fewer natural resources per capita, yet wealthier people and countries simply have to pay more to continue to receive more than their per capita share of natural resources.

Another way to view the negative effects of habitat destruction is to look at the opportunity cost of destroying a given habitat. In other words, what are people losing out on by taking away a given habitat? A country may increase its food supply by converting forest land to row-crop agriculture, but the value of the same land may be much larger when it can supply natural resources or services such as clean water, timber, ecotourism, or flood regulation and drought control.&lt;ref name="MEA"/&gt;

==Outlook==
The [[Human overpopulation|rapid expansion of the global human population]] is increasing the world’s food requirement substantially. Simple logic dictates that more people will require more food. In fact, as the world’s population increases dramatically, agricultural output will need to increase by at least 50%, over the next 30 years.&lt;ref name="Tilman"&gt;Tilman et al., 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, continually moving to new land and soils provided a boost in food production to meet the global food demand. That easy fix will no longer be available, however, as more than 98% of all land suitable for agriculture is already in use or degraded beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The impending global [[food crisis]] will be a major source of habitat destruction. Commercial farmers are going to become desperate to produce more food from the same amount of land, so they will use more [[fertilizer]]s and show less concern for the environment to meet the market demand. Others will seek out new land or will convert other land-uses to agriculture. Agricultural intensification will become widespread at the cost of the environment and its inhabitants. Species will be pushed out of their habitat either directly by habitat destruction or indirectly by fragmentation, [[environmental degradation|degradation]], or [[pollution]]. Any efforts to protect the world’s remaining natural habitat and biodiversity will compete directly with humans’ growing demand for natural resources, especially new agricultural lands.&lt;ref name="Tilman"/&gt;

==Solutions==
[[File:Hawaii turtle.JPG|thumb|''[[Chelonia mydas]]'' on a Hawaiian coral reef. Although the endangered species is protected, habitat loss from human development is a major reason for the loss of [[green turtle]] nesting beaches.]]
In most cases of tropical deforestation, three to four underlying causes are driving two to three proximate causes.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt; This means that a universal policy for controlling tropical deforestation would not be able to address the unique combination of proximate and underlying causes of deforestation in each country.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt; Before any local, national, or international deforestation policies are written and enforced, governmental leaders must acquire a detailed understanding of the complex combination of proximate causes and underlying driving forces of deforestation in a given area or country.&lt;ref name="Geist"/&gt; This concept, along with many other results of tropical deforestation from the Geist and Lambin study, can easily be applied to habitat destruction in general. Governmental leaders need to take action by addressing the underlying driving forces, rather than merely regulating the proximate causes. In a broader sense, governmental bodies at a local, national, and international scale need to emphasize the following:

#Considering the many irreplaceable ecosystem services provided by natural habitats.
#Protecting remaining intact sections of natural habitat.
#Educating the public about the importance of natural habitat and biodiversity.
#Developing [[family planning]] programs in areas of rapid population growth.
#Finding ecological ways to increase agricultural output without increasing the total land in production.
#Preserving habitat corridors to minimize prior damage from fragmented habitats.
#Reducing [[human population]] and expansion. Apart from improving access to contraception globally, furthering gender equality also has a great benefit. When women have the same education (decision-making power), this generally leads to smaller families.

'''Henry Richard Gibson''' (December 24, 1837 &amp;ndash; May 25, 1938) was an [[United States|American]] attorney and politician who represented [[Tennessee's 2nd congressional district|Tennessee's 2nd district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] from 1895 to 1905.  He also served as a state chancery court judge, and was a delegate to Tennessee's 1870 constitutional convention.  Outside politics he wrote and edited several books on federal and state law.

==Early life==
Gibson was born on [[Kent Island, Maryland|Kent Island]], [[Maryland]], in [[Queen Anne's County, Maryland|Queen Anne's County]], son of Woolman and Catherine (Carter) Gibson.&lt;ref name="allison134"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allison|first1=John|title=Notable Men of Tennessee: Personal and Genealogical, with portraits|date=1905|publisher=Southern historical Association|location=Atlanta, Georgia|pages=134-135|oclc=2561350|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_Fag-AAAAYAAJ#page/n131/mode/2up|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the common schools at Kent Island and at [[Bladensburg, Maryland]]. He graduated from Decker's Academy at Bladensburg in 1858 and from [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]] at [[Geneva, New York]], in 1862.&lt;ref name=bioguide /&gt;

Gibson served in the commissary department of the [[Union Army]] from March 1863 to July 1865. He entered [[Albany Law School]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] in September 1865. He was admitted to the bar in December 1865 and commenced practice in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], in January 1866. He moved to [[Jacksboro, Tennessee]], in [[Campbell County, Tennessee|Campbell County]] in October 1866, and was appointed commissioner of claims by Governor [[William G. Brownlow]] in 1868.&lt;ref name=bioguide /&gt;  He eventually formed a law partnership with [[Leonidas C. Houk]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Perry Temple]], "[https://books.google.com/books?id=Yw8UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=%22forming+a+partnership+with+Henry+R.+Gibson%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XFIZUszNLISG2gWtv4DIDA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22forming%20a%20partnership%20with%20Henry%20R.%20Gibson%22&amp;f=false Leonidas C. Houk]," ''Notable Men of Tennessee'' (Cosmopolitan Press, 1912), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, Gibson represented [[Anderson County, Tennessee|Anderson]] and [[Campbell County, Tennessee|Campbell]] counties at the state convention which created the present [[Tennessee State Constitution]].

Gibson was a member of the [[Tennessee Senate]] from 1871 to 1873, representing the fourth district ([[Claiborne County, Tennessee|Claiborne]], [[Grainger County, Tennessee|Grainger]], Anderson and Campbell).&lt;ref&gt;Diane Black, "[http://www.tennessee.gov/tsla/history/misc/tga-senate3.pdf Tennessee Senators]," Tennessee State Library and Archives, 2010, p. 26. Retrieved: 23 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a member of the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]] from 1875 to 1877, representing [[Union County, Tennessee|Union]], Campbell and [[Scott County, Tennessee|Scott]] counties.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2NEGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=%22Union,+Campbell,+and+Scott-H.+R.+Gibson%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_lcZUtDgLoal2wWPnoA4&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Union%2C%20Campbell%2C%20and%20Scott-H.%20R.%20Gibson%22&amp;f=false Tennessee Blue Book]'' (1890), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson returned to Knoxville in 1876, and founded the ''Knoxville Republican'', a campaign newspaper, three years later.   In 1882, he and a group of investors purchased the ''Knoxville Daily Chronicle'' from [[William Rule (American editor)|William Rule]], and merged it with the ''Republican'' under the new name, ''Knoxville Republican-Chronicle'' (Rule would re-purchase this paper within a few years, however).&lt;ref&gt;William Rule, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xpsaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA331&amp;dq=%22present+representative+in+congress+from+the+Knoxville%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VhwZUrK1HKbC2gXduYH4BQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22present%20representative%20in%20congress%20from%20the%20Knoxville%22&amp;f=false Standard History of Knoxville]'' (Lewis Publishing Company, 1900), pp. 331-332.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson served as a United States pension agent at Knoxville from June 22, 1883, until June 9, 1885. From 1886 to 1894, he was [[Chancellor#Functions related to justice and the law|chancellor]] of the second chancery division of Tennessee.  In 1891, he published a legal text, ''Gibson’s Suits in Chancery''.  Gibson worked as a professor of [[medical jurisprudence]] at the Tennessee Medical College from 1889 to 1906.&lt;ref name=bioguide&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry R. Gibson|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000161|publisher=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congress==
Gibson's law partner, Leonidas Houk, was elected to the [[Tennessee's 2nd congressional district|2nd district seat]] in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1878, and served throughout the 1880s. During this period, Houk developed a [[political machine]] that largely controlled the state Republican Party, and established Republican dominance in the [[Tennessee's 1st congressional district|1st]] and 2nd districts. Gibson, who remained a close confidant of Houk, was influential within the Houk machine, and was considered by many Houk's rightful successor following the congressman's sudden death in 1891. He lacked the organization to mount a campaign, however, and Houk's son, [[John Chiles Houk]], was elected to the congressional seat.&lt;ref name=mckinney&gt;Gordon B. McKinney, "Farewell to the Bloody Shirt: The Decline of the Houk Machine," East Tennessee Historical Society ''Publications'', Volume 46 (1974), pp. 100–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, Gibson launched his campaign for the 2nd district seat.  The younger Houk's popularity had declined when evidence surfaced that he had helped ensure the defeat of Houk machine rival [[Henry Clay Evans]] in the [[Tennessee's 3rd congressional district|3rd district]]. Historian Gordon McKinney described the contest between Gibson and Houk for the Republican nomination as "one of the dirtiest in East Tennessee history."&lt;ref name=mckinney /&gt; Houk assailed Gibson's war record, and managed to have Gibson expelled from the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] (the GAR determined Gibson had been a civilian employee, not a soldier). Gibson accused Houk of frequently missing votes, including a key vote on a veterans' pensions bill, and argued that the silence of politicians like Houk on the tariff issue was to blame for the [[Panic of 1893]]. In the March primary, Gibson edged Houk, 14,072 votes to 13,119.&lt;ref name=mckinney /&gt; Houk refused to drop out, and opposed Gibson as an independent in the general election, but again was defeated, 16,215 votes to 13,191 (the Democrats did not field a candidate).&lt;ref name=mckinney /&gt;&lt;ref name=ourcampaigns&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=232858 Henry R. Gibson], ''Our Campaigns''. Retrieved: 23 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson supported protectionist measures, such as tariffs on imports, and generally supported prohibition.&lt;ref name=mckinney /&gt;  In January 1896, he introduced a bill that would have provided pensions for survivors of the [[Sultana (steamboat)|steamboat ''Sultana'']] disaster, though the bill was never passed.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry O. Potter, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KGtCtH3PKrEC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=%22henry+r.+gibson%22+house+of+representatives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IEoZUvnWHImA2gW3poDgAQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22henry%20r.%20gibson%22%20house%20of%20representatives&amp;f=false The Sultana Tragedy: America's Greatest Maritime Disaster]'' (Pelican Publishing, 1892), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; He voted for the [[Spanish–American War|declaration of war with Spain]] in April 1898.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Na0YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=%22All+the+congressmen+voted+for+the+resolution+except+the+following:%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AVkZUqT5HcKA2gXkz4HwBg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22All%20the%20congressmen%20voted%20for%20the%20resolution%20except%20the%20following%3A%22&amp;f=false Appleton's Annual Cyclopaedia and Register of Important Events of the Year]'', 1898 edition, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 14, 1898, he delivered a speech on the House floor calling for the [[Newlands Resolution|annexation of Hawaii]] and the construction of the [[Nicaragua Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry R. Gibson, "[https://archive.org/details/hawaiigreatocean00gibs Hawaii, the Great Ocean Crossroad]" (Government Printing Office, 1898), p. 12, e.g.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the intraparty fighting between [[Walter P. Brownlow]] and Henry Clay Evans for control of the state Republican Party, Gibson aligned himself with Brownlow. In 1902, [[Nathan W. Hale]], who was supported by the Evans faction, challenged Gibson for the 2nd district's Republican nomination, but was defeated in the primary. Gibson did not seek reelection in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Langsdon, ''Tennessee: A Political History'' (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 238–239.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==

After his service as United States Representative, Gibson retired from public life and resided in [[Washington, D.C.]]. He was engaged as a writer, as an author, and as a consulting editor of the ''American and English Encyclopedia of Law and Practice''.  In 1907, he published a 368-page epic poem, ''The Maid of Redenfayn''.  He published an expanded version of this poem in 1912 under the title, ''The Ban of Baldurbane''.&lt;ref name=rothrock /&gt;  He was an associate reviser in 1918 of the ''Code of Tennessee'', having helped edit the 1896 volume.&lt;ref name=bioguide /&gt;

Gibson died on May 25, 1938 at the age of 100 in Washington. His remains were cremated and the ashes were spread around his hometown in Maryland, though a monument at  [[Old Gray Cemetery]] in Knoxville bears his name.&lt;ref name=rothrock /&gt;&lt;ref name=findagrave&gt;{{findagrave|7256934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death, he was the last living person known to have been born in 1837, as the last Union general [[Aaron Daggett]] died 11 days prior. &lt;ref name="GRG"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grg.org/Adams/OldestCentYear.HTM | title=Oldest people born in years at time of death | accessdate=October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Gibson married Frances Reed on November 12, 1863.  They had two daughters.  Following her death in 1919, he married Lizzie (Beckerdite) Clark in 1920.&lt;ref name=rothrock /&gt;

The '''HUSAR rover''' is part of the [[Hunveyor]] system. Like as Hunveyor (Hungarian UNiversity SURVEYOR) is an experimental university lander model, so the HUSAR is (Hungarian University Surface Analyser Rover) an experimental university rover model. This rover accompanies the Hunveyor as like Sojourner was accompanying the Mars Pathfinder lander. For the Hunveyor the Surveyor was the example, for the Husar-rover the [[Mars Pathfinder]]-Sojourner system was the example from the real space exploration world.

The Hunveyor-Husar system is an educational work at Hungarian Universities, Colleges and High Schools. There are smaller and larger model-cars supported by onboard computer, camera and some additional instrumentation. The building of the Husar-rover types is focusing on the basic planetary surface activities by moving vehicle. The rover has a solar panel on its board placed on a model-car chassis. In the Husar-b version the drive is on the back wheels by electric engines, movements are controlled by the camera view through a wireless connection to the computer. It can be used for roving among rocks and observing their surfaces. On a larger chassis Husar-2a version there are independent driving on all the four wheels. This fact allows directing a special movement. The rover can turn in a very narrow arc which is important to approach objects in side direction. The wheels in one axis are connected by a differential. The structural framework, the driving mechanism all have a left- and right-hand side symmetric structure. The movements are directed through servo engines, which were originally designed for analogous direction, however, even 8 of these servos can be directed by a microcontroller. This microcontroller gets the position of the servos through RS 232 port of the computer. The camera of Husar-2 transmits images with 30 frame/sec, and it has wireless connection with the computer (1200&amp;nbsp;MHz).

In a planetary simulation work we use testfields which are analog to a selected planetary surface. On the testfields (test table) the most important rock types from the [[Solar System]] are arranged around the Hunveyor and Husar. For example, desert sand morphology (according to the observations of [[Mars Pathfinder]]) can be modelled around lander and rover in order to give a real planetary environment for simulation studies. Complex studies of the main streams in the surface, wind system and rock interactions also can be modelled. (i.e. stream strength of the wind can be deciphered from the deposition of deflation style of the lee-forms). We show one of our test-fields around Hunveyor and Husar.

Husar rovers were built with Hunveyor-1, -2, and -4 landers, and they were independently built by the Husar-5 and Husar-6 groups at [[Budapest]], [[Pécs]], [[Székesfehérvár]], [[Sopron]] and Dorog.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2282">'''Intrinsic aging''' and '''extrinsic aging''' are terms used to describe [[cutaneous]] aging of the [[skin]] and other parts of the [[integumentary system]], which while having [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] [[wikt: concomitant|concomitants]], seems to primarily involve the [[dermis]].&lt;ref&gt;YU RJ, Van Scott EJ: Alpha-hydroxy Acids: Science and Therapeutic Use. ''A Sup to Cosmetic Dermatology'', Oct 1994. 1(1):1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Intrinsic aging is influenced by internal physiological factors alone, and extrinsic aging by many external factors.  Intrinsic aging is also called ''chronologic aging'', and extrinsic aging is most often referred to as ''photoaging''.

== Causes and effects ==
The effects of ''intrinsic aging'' are caused primarily by internal factors alone.  It is sometimes referred to as chronological aging and is an inherent degenerative process due to declining physiologic functions and capacities.  Such an aging process may include qualitative and quantitative changes and includes diminished or defective synthesis of [[collagen]] and [[elastin]] in the dermis.

''Extrinsic aging'' of skin is a distinctive declination process caused by external factors, which include ultra-violet radiation, cigarette smoking, air pollution, among others.  Of all extrinsic causes, radiation from sunlight has the most widespread documentation of its negative effects on the skin.  Because of this, extrinsic aging is often referred to as photoaging.&lt;ref&gt;Gilchrest BA: Overview of skin aging.

A '''ledger line''' or '''leger line''' is used in Western [[musical notation]] to notate [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] above or below the lines and spaces of the regular [[musical staff]]. A line slightly longer than the note head is drawn parallel to the staff, above or below, spaced at the same distance as the lines within the staff. 

The origin of the word is uncertain, but may have been borrowed attributively from the term for a horizontal timber in a [[scaffolding]], lying parallel to the face of the building and supporting the [[putlog]]s. There is no basis to support the often-found claim that the word originates from the French ''léger'', meaning "light" or "slight" {{harv|OED|2005}}. The Oxford online dictionary describes the origin of the "leger" spelling as a "variant of ledger" that first appeared in the 19th century {{harv|Oxford Living Dictionary|n.d.}}.

Although ledger lines are found occasionally in manuscripts of [[plainchant]] and early [[polyphony]], it was only in the early 16th century in keyboard music that their use became at all extensive {{harv|Anon.|2001}}. Even then, printers had an aversion to ledger lines which caused difficulties in setting type, wasting space on the page and causing a messy appearance. Vocal music employed a variety of different clefs to keep the range of the part on the staff as much as possible; in keyboard notation a common way of avoiding ledger lines was the use of [[open score]] on four staves with different [[Clef|clefs]] {{harv|Godwin|1974|loc=16–17}}.

Except for woodwind players, who prefer ledger lines to ''[[Octave#Notation|8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt;]]'' notation because they associate fingerings with staff positions {{harv|Shatzkin|1993|loc=48}}, notes that use at least four ledger lines make music more difficult to read.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} For easier readability, the composer would usually switch [[clefs]] or use the ''[[octave|8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt;]]'' notation. Some [[transposing instrument]]s, such as the [[piccolo]], [[double bass]], [[guitar]], and the [[tenor voice]], transpose at the octave to avoid ledger lines.

Notation of [[tuba]], [[trombone]], and [[euphonium]] parts always use ledger lines below the bass staff, and never the ''[[8vb|8&lt;sup&gt;va&lt;/sup&gt; bassa]]'' notation {{harv|Read|1969|loc=354}}.

When music for bass clef instruments, such as the cello or trombone, goes several ledger lines above the bass clef, the [[tenor clef]] is used; if it were to go even higher than practical in tenor clef, the notes may be notated in treble clef, or in the case of trombone, alto clef.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;!--I have never seen a part for tenor trombone scored in alto clef nor heard of such a convention. Typically trombone in the high register stays in tenor clef and while it is very rare, if it is necessary to go higher the treble clef is used. Alto clef wouldn't really do much in this situation seeing as you can only go up another third before you get in trouble again.--&gt;

A ledger line is also used to support a [[half note|half rest]] {{music|halfrest}} or [[whole note|whole rest]] {{music|wholerest}} where there are multiple voices on one staff and such a rest is forced above or below the staff. (The rare [[double whole note|double whole rest]] is suspended between two ledger lines in this situation.)

The idea of language as a 'system' appears in the linguistic theory of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[J.R. Firth]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], [[Louis Hjelmslev]], and [[Michael Halliday]].

The paradigmatic principle - the idea that the process of using language involves choosing from a specifiable set of options - was established in semiotics by Saussure, whose concept of value (viz. “valeur”), and of signs as terms in a system, “showed up paradigmatic organization as the most abstract dimension of meaning” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2004. Introduction: How Big is a Language? On the Power of Language. In The Language of Science: Volume 5 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

=='System' in systemic functional linguistics==
“System” is used in two related ways in [[systemic functional linguistics]] (SFL). SFL uses the idea of system to refer to language as a whole, (e.g. “the system of language”). This usage derives from [[Louis Hjelmslev|Hjelmslev]] &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2004. Introduction: How Big is a Language? On the Power of Language. In The Language of Science: Volume 5 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, [[Jay Lemke]] describes language as an open, dynamic system.

There is also the notion of “system” as used by [[John Rupert Firth|J.R. Firth]], where linguistic systems are considered to furnish the background for elements of structure.&lt;ref&gt;Firth, J.R. 1968. Selected Papers of J.R. Firth 1952-1959. London: Longman. p183.&lt;/ref&gt; Halliday argues that, unlike system in the sense in which it was used by Firth was a conception only found in Firth’s linguistic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Systemic Background. In "Systemic Perspectives on Discourse, Vol. 1: Selected Theoretical Papers" from the ''Ninth International Systemic Workshop'', James D. Benson and William S. Greaves (eds). Ablex. Reprinted in Full in Volume 3 in ''The Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum. p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this use of the term “system”, grammatical, or other features of language, are considered best understood when described as sets of options. Thus, “the most abstract categories of the grammatical description are the systems together with their options (systemic features). A systemic grammar differs from other functional grammars (and from all formal grammars) in that it is paradigmatic: a system is paradigmatic set of alternative features, of which one must be chosen if the entry condition is satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1992. Systemic Grammar and the Concept of a “Science of Language”. In Waiguoyu (Journal of Foreign Languages), No. 2 (General Series No. 78), pp1-9. Reprinted in Full in Volume 3 in ''The Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum. p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Halliday’s early work, “system” was considered to be one of four fundamental categories for the theory of grammar, the others being unit, structure and class. The category of ‘system’ was invoked to account for “the occurency of one rather than another from among a number of like events” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1961. Categories of the Theory of Grammar. Word. 17(3). pp241-92. Reprinted in Full in On Grammar: Volume 1 of the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum. p 52&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Halliday defined grammar as “that level of linguistic form at which operate closed systems” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1961. Categories of the Theory of Grammar. Word. 17(3). pp241-92. Reprinted in Full in On Grammar: Volume 1 of the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum. p 40&lt;/ref&gt; 

In adopting a system perspective on language, systemic functional linguistics can be seen as part of a more general 20th and 21st century reaction against atomistic approaches to science, in which an essence is sought after within smaller and smaller components of the phenomenon under study. In systems thinking, any delineated object of study is defined by its relations to other units postulated by the theory. In systemic functional linguistics, this has been described as the trinocular perspective. Thus a descriptive category must be defended from three perspectives: from above (‘what does it construe?’ ‘what effect does it have in a context of use?’), below (‘how is this function realized?’) and round about (‘what else is in the neighbourhood?’ ‘what other things does this thing have to interact with?’). This gives systemic functional linguistics an affinity with studies of [[complex systems]].

[[Image:Link_log_diagram.jpg|thumb|alt=Format of a link log record]]

A '''linklog''' is a type of [[blog]] which is meant to act as a linked list.  Common practice is for the post titles to link directly to an external [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s, and the content of the post includes information to complement the associated URL.&lt;ref name="octopress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/linklog/|title=Writing a Linklog|date=2012-02-12|last1=Mathis|first1=Brandon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linklogs existed as a feature of computing systems before the internet as well.  In distributed file systems a link log was a method of recording data in which a record is created and added to the proper log when updating a transaction.  The format of a log record closely matches the specification of the transaction type it corresponds to.  Link log records consisted of two parts in such a system:  a set of type-independent fields, and a set of type-specific fields.  The former set consists of pointers to the preceding and succeeding records of the log.&lt;ref name="kistler"&gt;{{cite book|title=Disconnected Operation in a Distributed File System|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540606277|archive-url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~coda/docdir/jjk-thesis.pdf|archive-date=1993-05-01|format=PDF|last1=Kistler|first1=James|date=1993-05-01|location=School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University|publisher=Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg|doi=10.1007/3-540-60627-0|isbn=9783540606277|issn=0302-9743|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In PBX systems such as [[AUDIX]] link-logs were a collection of data collecting to assist operators in maintaining the system.&lt;ref name="audix"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://downloads.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/003676390|format=PDF|page=35|publisher=Lucent Technologies|title=DEFINITY AUDIX System Release 3.2.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Low-frequency collective motion in proteins and DNA''' refers to the application of [[statistical thermodynamics]] to understand low-frequency vibrations in biomolecules.&lt;ref name="Chou_1988b"/&gt;
  
The concept was first proposed by Professors [[Kuo-Chen Chou]] (周国城) and Nian-Yi Chen (陈念贻) in studying the binding interaction between proteins such as insulin and [[insulin receptor]] &lt;ref name="Chou_1977"/&gt;. It was noted by them that enumerating the known explanations for the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] change, such as translational and rotational [[entropy]], [[hydrogen bond]]s, [[van der Waals interaction]]s, and [[hydrophobic interaction]]s, did not fully account for the observed free energy change for the reaction.  It was inferred that the deficit could be explained by the creation of extra vibrational modes with very low [[wave number]]s in the range of 10&amp;ndash;100&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to the range of terahertz frequency (3×10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; to 3×10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Hz).&lt;ref name="Chou_1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chothia_1975"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sinkala_2006b"/&gt;

Subsequently, the aforementioned low-frequency modes have been indeed observed by [[Raman spectroscopy]] for a number of protein molecules&lt;ref name="Painter_1982"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turton|first=David A.|last2=Senn|first2=Hans Martin|last3=Harwood|first3=Thomas|last4=Lapthorn|first4=Adrian J.|last5=Ellis|first5=Elizabeth M.|last6=Wynne|first6=Klaas|date=2014-06-03|title=Terahertz underdamped vibrational motion governs protein-ligand binding in solution|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4999|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=5|pages=ncomms4999|doi=10.1038/ncomms4999|bibcode=2014NatCo...5E3999T}}&lt;/ref&gt; and different types of DNA.&lt;ref name="Painter_1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Urabe_1982"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=González-Jiménez|first=Mario|last2=Ramakrishnan|first2=Gopakumar|last3=Harwood|first3=Thomas|last4=Lapthorn|first4=Adrian J.|last5=Kelly|first5=Sharon M.|last6=Ellis|first6=Elizabeth M.|last7=Wynne|first7=Klaas|date=2016-06-01|title=Observation of coherent delocalized phonon-like modes in DNA under physiological conditions|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11799|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=7|pages=ncomms11799|doi=10.1038/ncomms11799|bibcode=2016NatCo...711799G}}&lt;/ref&gt; These observed results have also been further confirmed by [[neutron scattering]] experiments.&lt;ref name="Martel_1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nickels_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perticaroli_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perticaroli_2014"/&gt;

==Experimental results ==
The beta-barrel protein GFP has been shown by coherent neutron scattering to undergo collective motions of the secondary structural units at ~1 THz.&lt;ref name="Nickels_2013"/&gt;
These motions are thought to be sensitive to local rigidity within proteins, revealing beta structures to be generically more rigid than alpha or disordered proteins.&lt;ref name="Perticaroli_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perticaroli_2014"/&gt;

The quasi-continuum model is one model developed to identify and analyze this kind of low-frequency motions in protein and DNA molecules.  This model operates on an intermediate level of complexity between the elastic global model, which treats the biomolecule as a continuous elastic sphere, and atomistic [[normal mode]] methods.&lt;ref name="Thirumuruganandham_2009"/&gt;  It treats the biomolecule's backbone as a continuous mass distribution, with discrete interactions representing hydrogen bonds modeling the effects of internal conformation.  This has the advantage of being simpler than explicit-atom methods, and providing a much more intuitive physical picture of the dynamics involved.&lt;ref name="Sinkala_2006b"/&gt;

It has been successfully used to simulate various low-frequency collective motions in protein and DNA molecules, such as accordion-like motion, pulsation or breathing motion, as reflected by the fact that the low-frequency wave numbers thus derived were quite close to the experimental observations.&lt;ref name="Chou_1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chou_1984a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chou_1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chou_1989a"/&gt;

==Application to biological functions and medical treatments==

Many biological functions and their profound dynamic mechanisms can be revealed through the low-frequency collective motion or resonance in protein and DNA molecules, such as cooperative effects,&lt;ref name="Chou_1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chou_1989b"/&gt; allosteric transition,&lt;ref name="Chou_1984b"/&gt; and intercalation of drugs into DNA.&lt;ref name="Chou_1988"/&gt;  In this regard, some phenomenological theories&lt;ref name="Chou_1985c"/&gt; were established.  Meanwhile, the [[soliton|solitary wave]] motion was also used to address the internal motion during [[microtubule]] growth.&lt;ref name="Chou_1994"/&gt; The relationship between solitons&amp;mdash;a self-reinforcing solitary wave (a [[wave packet]] or pulse) that maintains its shape while it travels at constant speed&amp;mdash;and the low-frequency phonons in proteins have been discussed in a recent paper.&lt;ref name="Sinkala_2006"/&gt;

This kind of low-frequency collective motion has also been observed in [[calmodulin]] by [[NMR]],&lt;ref name="Chou_2001"/&gt; and applied in medical treatments.&lt;ref name="Gordon_2007"/&gt;

'''Musicology''' ({{ety|gre|''μουσική'' (mousikē)|music||''-λογία'' (-logia)|study of}}) is the scholarly analysis and research-based study of [[music]]. Musicology is part of the [[humanities]]. A scholar who participates in musical research is a '''musicologist'''.&lt;ref&gt;John Haines, ''Eight Centuries of Troubadours and Trouvères: The Changing Identity of Medieval Music'' (Cambridge, 2004), '55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For broad treatments, see the entry on "musicology" in [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove's dictionary]], the entry on "Musikwissenschaft" in ''Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', and the classic approach of Adler (1885).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Guido (1885). Umfang, Methode und Ziel der Musikwissenschaft. Vierteljahresschrift für Musikwissenschaft, 1, 5-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, [[historical musicology]] (commonly termed "music history") has been the most prominent sub-discipline of musicology. In the 2010s, historical musicology is one of several large musicology sub-disciplines. Historical musicology, [[ethnomusicology]], and [[systematic musicology]] are approximately equal in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?page=whatisethnomusicol|title=What is Ethnomusicology? - Society for Ethnomusicology|website=The Society for Ethnomusicology|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnomusicology is the study of music in its cultural context. Systematic musicology includes music acoustics, the science and technology of acoustical musical instruments, and the musical implications of physiology, psychology, sociology, philosophy and computing. [[Cognitive musicology]] is the set of phenomena surrounding the computational modeling of music. In some countries, [[music education]] is a prominent sub-field of musicology, while in others it is regarded as a distinct academic field, or one more closely affiliated with [[teacher education]], [[educational research]], and related fields. Like music education, [[music therapy]] is a specialized form of applied musicology which is sometimes considered more closely affiliated with health fields, and other times regarded as part of musicology proper.

==Parent disciplines==
The parent disciplines of musicology include:
* General [[history]]
* [[Cultural studies]]
* [[Philosophy]] (particularly [[aesthetics]] and [[semiotics]])
* [[Ethnology]] and [[cultural anthropology]]
* [[Archeology]] and [[prehistory]]
* [[Psychology]] and [[sociology]]
* [[Physiology]] and [[neuroscience]]
* [[Acoustics]] and [[psychoacoustics]]
* Computer/[[information sciences]] and [[mathematics]]

Musicology also has two central, practically oriented sub-disciplines with no parent discipline: [[performance practice]] and research (sometimes viewed as a form of [[Research#Artistic research|artistic research]]), and the [[music theory|theory]], [[musical analysis|analysis]] and composition of music. The disciplinary neighbors of musicology address other forms of [[art]], [[performance]], [[ritual]] and [[communication]], including the history and theory of the visual and plastic arts and of architecture; [[linguistics]], [[literature]] and [[theater]]; religion and [[theology]]; and sport. Musical knowledge is applied in medicine, [[education]], and [[music therapy]]—which, effectively, are parent disciplines of applied musicology.

===Historical musicology===
{{Main|Music history}}
[[File:Beethoven opus 101 manuscript.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Historical musicology, which was traditionally the most prominent subdiscipline of musicology, studies the history of music. Central to this study is the examination of historical [[sheet music|scores]], such as this original manuscript sketch by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] for [[Piano Sonata No. 28 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 28]], Movement IV, ''Geschwind, doch nicht zu sehr und mit Entschlossenheit'' ([[Tempo|Allegro]]), in his own handwriting. The piece was completed in 1816.]]
'''Music history''' or '''historical musicology''' is concerned with the composition, performance, reception, and criticism of [[music]] over [[time]]. Historical studies of music are for example concerned with a composer's life and works, the developments of styles and genres, ''e.g.'', baroque concertos, the social function of music for a particular group of people, ''e.g.'', court music, or modes of performance at a particular place and time, ''e.g.'', Johann Sebastian Bach's choir in Leipzig. Like the comparable field of [[art history]], different branches and schools of historical musicology emphasize different types of musical works and approaches to music.  There are also national differences in various definitions of historical musicology.  In theory, "music history" could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of music, ''e.g.'', the history of [[Music of India|Indian music]] or the history of [[Rock music|rock]]. In practice, these research topics are more often considered within [[ethnomusicology]] (see below) and "historical musicology" is typically assumed to imply Western Art music of the European tradition.

The methods of historical musicology include source studies (especially [[manuscript]] studies), [[Palaeography|paleography]], [[philology]] (especially [[textual criticism]]), style criticism, historiography (the choice of [[historical method]]), musical analysis (analysis of music to find "inner coherence"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Beard, David | author2=Gloag, Kenneth | title=Musicology: The Key Concepts | year=2005 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-415-31692-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[iconography]]. The application of musical analysis to further these goals is often a part of music history, though pure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be seen in the field of [[music theory]]. Music historians create a number of written products, ranging from journal articles describing their current research, new editions of musical works, [[Biography|biographies]] of composers and other musicians, book-length studies or university textbook chapters or entire textbooks. Music historians may examine issues in a close focus, as in the case of scholars who examine the relationship between [[word]]s and music for a given composer's [[art song]]s. On the other hand, some scholars take a broader view, and assess the place of a given type of music, such as the [[symphony]] in [[society]] using techniques drawn from other fields, such as economics, sociology, or philosophy.

''[[New musicology]]'' is a term applied since the late 1980s to a wide body of work emphasizing [[cultural studies|cultural study]], analysis, and criticism of music. Such work may be based on [[Feminism|feminist]], [[gender studies]], [[queer theory]], or [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] theory, or the work of [[Theodor W. Adorno]]. Although New Musicology emerged from within historical musicology, the emphasis on cultural study within the Western art music tradition places New Musicology at the junction between historical, ethnological and sociological research in music.

New musicology was a reaction against traditional historical musicology, which according to [[Susan McClary]], "fastidiously declares issues of musical signification off-limits to those engaged in legitimate scholarship." [[Charles Rosen]], however, retorts that McClary, "sets up, like so many of the 'new musicologists', a [[straw man]] to knock down, the [[dogma]] that music has no meaning, and no political or social significance."&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Rosen | first=Charles | chapter=The New Musicology&lt;!--pp.&amp;nbsp;255–272.--&gt; | title=Critical Entertainments: Music Old and New | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-674-00684-3 | page=264}} "(I doubt that anyone, except perhaps the nineteenth-century critic Hanslick, has ever really believed that, although some musicians have been goaded into proclaiming it by the sillier interpretations of music with which we are often assailed.)"&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many musicologists no longer distinguish between musicology and new musicology, since many of the scholarly concerns once associated with new musicology have now become mainstream, and they feel the term "new" no longer applies.

[[Ethnomusicology]], formerly '''comparative musicology''', is the study of [[music]] in its [[cultural]] context.  It is often considered the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music. [[Jeff Todd Titon]] has called it the study of "people making music". Although it is most often concerned with the study of non-[[Western world|Western]] musics, it also includes the study of Western music from an anthropological or sociological perspective, [[cultural studies]] and [[sociology]] as well as other disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. Some ethnomusicologists primarily conduct historical studies,&lt;ref&gt;McCollum, Jonathan and Hebert, David, Eds., (2014). ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology'' Lanham, MD: Rowman&amp;Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; but the majority are involved in long-term participant observation, or combine ethnographic and historical approaches in their fieldwork. Therefore, ethnomusiological scholarship can be characterized as featuring a substantial, intensive fieldwork component, often involving long-term residence within the community studied.
Closely related to ethnomusiology is the emerging branch of [[sociomusicology]]. For instance, Ko (2011) proposed the hypothesis of "Biliterate and Trimusical" in Hong Kong sociomusicology.&lt;ref&gt;Ko, C. K. S. (2011). ''An analysis of sociomusicology, its issues; and the music and society in Hong Kong''. Hong Kong: Ko Ka Shing. {{ISBN|978-9-881-58021-4}}. This book has been selected for inclusion in the Association for Chinese Music Research Bibliography in 2012, see [http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10524/23174].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular music studies===
 &lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Popular musicology]] --&gt;

Popular music studies, known, "misleadingly,"&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Allan, ed. (2003). ''Analyzing Popular Music'', p.&amp;nbsp;2. {{ISBN|978-0-521-77120-7}}. p.&amp;nbsp;2n2 reads: "'Popular musicology' should be read as the musicological investigation of popular music, rather than the accessible investigation of music!"&lt;/ref&gt; as ''popular musicology'', emerged in the 1980s as an increasing number of musicologists, ethnomusicologists, and other varieties of historians of American and European culture began to write about popular musics past and present. The first journal focusing on popular music studies was [https://web.archive.org/web/20080411140144/http://www.cambridge.org/journals/journal_catalogue.asp?mnemonic=pmu Popular Music], which began publication in 1981. The same year an academic society solely devoted to the topic was formed, the [http://www.iaspm.net/ International Association for the Study of Popular Music]. The Association's founding was partly motivated by the interdisciplinary agenda of popular musicology though the group has been characterized by a polarized 'musicological' and 'sociological' approach also typical of popular musicology.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music theory, analysis and composition===
{{Main|Music theory}}

'''Music theory''' is a field of study that describes the elements of [[music]] and includes the development and application of methods for composing and for analyzing music through both [[musical notation|notation]] and, on occasion, musical sound itself.  Broadly, theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music ([[Benjamin Boretz|Boretz]], 1995).  A person who studies or practices music theory is a '''music theorist'''.

Some music theorists attempt to explain the techniques composers use by establishing rules and patterns.  Others model the experience of listening to or performing music.  Though extremely diverse in their interests and commitments, many Western music theorists are united in their belief that the acts of composing, performing, and listening to music may be explicated to a high degree of detail (this, as opposed to a conception of musical expression as fundamentally ineffable except in musical sounds). Generally, works of music theory are both descriptive and prescriptive, attempting both to define practice and to influence later practice.  Thus, music theory generally lags behind practice but also points towards future exploration, composition, and performance.

Musicians study music theory to understand the structural relationships in the (nearly always notated) music. Composers study music theory to understand how to produce effects and structure their own works.  Composers may study music theory to guide their [[precompositional]] and compositional decisions.  Broadly speaking, music theory in the Western tradition focuses on [[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]], and then uses these to explain large scale structure and the creation of [[melody]].

===Music psychology===
{{Main|Music psychology|Cognitive musicology|Cognitive neuroscience of music|Music therapy}}

Music psychology applies the content and methods of all subdisciplines of [[psychology]] ([[perception]], [[cognition]], [[motivation]], etc.) to understand how music is created, perceived, responded to, and incorporated into individuals' and societies' daily lives.&lt;ref name = Tan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siu-Lan |last2=Pfordresher |first2=Peter |last3=Harré |first3=Rom |date=2010 |title=Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |pages=2 |isbn=978-1-84169-868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary branches include [[cognitive musicology]], which emphasizes the use of computational models for human musical abilities and cognition, and the [[cognitive neuroscience of music]], which studies the way that music perception and production manifests in the brain using the methodologies of [[cognitive neuroscience]]. While aspects of the field can be highly theoretical, much of modern music psychology seeks to optimize the practices and professions of music performance, composition, education, and therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ockelford |first=Adam |chapter=Beyond music psychology |editor1-last=Hallam |editor1-first=Susan |editor2-last=Cross |editor2-first=Ian |editor3-last=Thaut |editor3-first=Michael |title=The Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology |date=2009 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-929845-7 |page=539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance practice and research===
{{Main|Authentic performance}}

Performance practice draws on many of the tools of historical musicology to answer the specific question of how music was performed in various places at various times in the past. Although previously confined to early music, recent research in performance practice has embraced questions such as how the early history of recording affected the use of [[vibrato]] in classical music, or instruments in [[Klezmer]].

Within the rubric of musicology, performance practice tends to emphasize the collection and synthesis of evidence about how music should be performed.  The important other side, learning how to sing authentically or perform a historical instrument is usually part of [[College or university school of music|conservatory]] or other performance training.  However, many top researchers in performance practice are also excellent musicians.

Music performance research (or music performance science) is strongly associated with music psychology. It aims to document and explain the psychological, physiological, sociological and cultural details of how music is actually performed (rather than how it should be performed). The approach to research tends to be systematic and empirical, and to involve the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings of music performance research can often be applied in [[music education]].

==Education and careers==
[[File:Satchmofest07JackStewartSpeaks.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Music historian Jack Stewart lectures at a conference.]]
Musicologists in tenure track professor positions typically hold a [[Ph.D]] in musicology. In the 1960s and 1970s, some musicologists obtained [[professor]] positions with an [[M.A.]] as their highest degree, but in the 2010s, the Ph.D is the [[terminal degree|standard minimum credential]] for [[tenure track]] professor positions. As part of their initial training, musicologists typically complete a [[B.Mus]] or a [[B.A.]] in music (or a related field such as history) and in many cases an [[M.A.]] in musicology. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree to a Ph.D, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for musicology Ph.D programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a B.Mus and an M.A. in psychology). In music education, individuals may hold an [[M.Ed]] and an [[Ed.D]].

Most musicologists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in [[college]]s, [[University|universities]] or [[Music school|conservatories]]. The job market for tenure track professor positions is very competitive. Entry-level applicants must hold a completed Ph.D or the equivalent degree and applicants to more senior professor positions must have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some Ph.D-holding musicologists are only able to find insecure positions as [[sessional lecturer]]s. The job tasks of a musicologist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: she teaches undergraduate and/or graduate classes in her area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as [[Music appreciation|Music Appreciation]] or Introduction to Music History), conducts research in her area of expertise, publishes articles about her research in peer-reviewed journals, authors book chapters, books or textbooks, travels to conferences to give talks on her research and learn about research in her field, and, if her program includes a [[graduate school]], supervises M.A. and Ph.D students and gives them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some musicology professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as [[Dean (education)|Dean]] or [[Chairman|Chair]] of the School of Music.

==Role of women==
[[File:Rosetta Reitz.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Rosetta Reitz]] (1924–2008) was an American [[jazz]] historian who established a record label producing 18 albums of the music of the early women of jazz and the blues.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Martin, Douglas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/arts/music/15reitz.html "Rosetta Reitz, Champion of Jazz Women, Dies at 84"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 November 2008. Accessed 19 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The vast majority of major musicologists and music historians from past generations have been men, as in the 19th century and early 20th century; women's involvement in teaching music was mainly in [[Women in music education|elementary and secondary music teaching]].&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015) When looking beyond bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "...home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "...as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations."&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. [[Carolyn Abbate]] (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at [[Princeton University]]. She has been described by the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' as "one of the world's most accomplished and admired music historians".&lt;ref name=HG&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/abbate-named-university-professor/ "Abbate named University Professor"], ''Harvard Gazette'', 20 November 2013. Accessed 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Susan McClary]] (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the "[[New Musicology]]" who incorporates [[feminism|feminist]] music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from [[Harvard University]]. One of her best known works is ''Feminine Endings'' (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians. In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of "purely musical" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.

{{nihongo|'''Nanpa'''|ナンパ}}, also [[romanization of Japanese|transliterated]] as '''nampa''', in [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]] is a type of [[flirting]] and [[seduction]] popular among [[Adolescence|teenagers]] and people in their twenties and thirties.

When Japanese women pursue men in a fashion similar to nanpa, it is called {{nihongo|'''gyakunan'''|ギャクナン}}.&lt;ref name="gyakunan"&gt;Botting, Geoff. [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20010408tc.html#1 "Japanese women on top."] ''[[The Japan Times]]'', April 8, 2001. Reprinted from ''Spa!'', April 4, 2001. Reviewed November 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Nanpa was a new word of the Meiji era with the opposite word [[Kouha]]. It was originally rendered in kanji as [[wikt:軟派|軟派]] (lit. "the soft school"). The meaning of nanpa was continually changing and different from what it means today. Initially, it referred to a political term with the meaning of "parties with soft opinion and proposition" or "people who are unable to claim a strong opinion" (1892), then it referred to "departments or reporters who are responsible for the articles of glossy things like social or literary in newspapers and magazines" (1901), eventually it meant "a faction of the youth who are enjoying pursuit of the opposite sex and fine clothing" (1909).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Nihon Kokugo Daijiten 2nd edition|last = |first = |publisher = Shogakukan|year = 2001|isbn = 4095210109|location = Tokyo|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it means people interested more in fun and self-indulgence than in "hard" pursuits like politics, academia, or athletics. In contemporary Japanese culture, nanpa most often refers to "girl hunting" and there is a strong negative connotation associated with it.

The word for boyfriend hunting by women, gyakunan, derives from {{nihongo|gyaku|逆||lit. "reverse"}}, and the first part of the word nanpa.&lt;ref name="gyakunan" /&gt;

==Description==
Nanpa is seen most often in young men ranging from their late teens to mid-twenties. Groups of "nanpa boys" will gather around places with busy, predominantly female [[Pedestrian|foot traffic]] (bridges, subway stations, shopping malls, etc.) and approach women in search of a date. The nanpa groups generally wear high fashion with nice suits, expensive shoes, and extravagant hair styles. Because of their style of dress, nanpa boys are occasionally misinterpreted by [[Gaijin|foreigners]] as employees of [[Host and hostess clubs#Host clubs|host clubs]], who also roam such areas speaking with various women.{{citation needed|date = April 2018}}

Because of increasing number of nanpa participants and rising complaints, many Japanese regions are reacting more harshly to participants. For example, many youth hangouts such as arcades are posting "No Nanpa" signs, and police in highly populated Japanese cities have been enforcing these rules. This may be in reaction to a growing fear in young Japanese women of abduction or rape. The [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] district is particularly strict on nanpa boys in the wake of the abduction of four girls by a middle aged man in July 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/16/world/tokyo-journal-a-flashy-teenage-trend-capital-and-its-dark-side.html|title=Tokyo Journal; A Flashy Teenage Trend Capital, and Its Dark Side|first=Norimitsu|last=Onishi|date=16 September 2003|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Same-sex nanpa==
Japan also has a [[homosexuality|same-sex]] nanpa culture, especially within the gay entertainment district of [[Shinjuku ni-chome]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51011">'''Natural capital accounting''' is the process of calculating the total [[stocks and flows]] of [[natural resources]] and services in a given ecosystem or region.&lt;ref name="Pembina"&gt;[http://www.pembina.org/economics/natural-capital,, "Natural Capital"], "Pembina Institute", 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Accounting for such goods may occur in physical or monetary terms. This process can subsequently inform government, corporate and consumer decision making as each relates to the use or consumption of natural resources and land, and sustainable behaviour.&lt;ref name="Pembina" /&gt;

== Methods of accounting ==

There are several methods of [[accounting]] which aim to address the issue of sustainability. These are: large and eclectic [[Dashboard (business)|dashboard]]s; [[composite (finance)|composite indices]]; indices focusing on [[overconsumption]]; adjusted economic indicators.

=== Large and eclectic dashboards ===

These dashboards bring together a number of indicators that are directly and indirectly related to the durability of socio-economic progress.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Jean-Paul Fitoussi, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090916235317/http://www.stiglitz-sen-fitoussi.fr/documents/rapport_anglais.pdf "Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress"], "Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress", 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this is the [[Eurostat]] Sustainable Development Indicators, which is a list of over 100 indicators used to monitor the EU Sustainable Development Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/sdi/indicators, "Indicators"], "Eurostat", 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism associated with these dashboards is that a large number of indicators risks muddling a clear message about sustainability that resonates with policy makers or citizens.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/greengrowth/greengrowthindicators.htm, "Green growth indicators"], "OECD"&lt;/ref&gt; In response, there has been a greater tendency to select headline indicators that "track central elements of green growth and [are] representative of a broader set of green growth issues."&lt;ref name="OECD" /&gt;

=== Composite indices ===

Composite indices normalize and aggregate various data into a single number.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt; For example, the [[Human Development Index]], Osberg and Sharpe's Index of Economic Well-Being, the Changing Wealth of Nations, or the [[Environmental Sustainability Index]], which ranks countries based on an assessment of 76 variables covering 5 domains.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt; It is often instructive to examine the separate dimensions of these indices.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt; However, they may present a skewed view of countries' contributions to environmental problems and make problematic, normative assumptions about the values of certain variables.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt;

=== Adjusted GDPs ===

Adjusted gross domestic product, or [[green GDP]], systematically corrects conventional [[GDP]] by taking into account aspects of a country's production of goods and services (e.g. [[environmental degradation]] and natural resource depletion) that would not otherwise be included in the indicator, but are relevant to sustainability.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt;

=== Indices focusing on overconsumption ===

Indicators that fall in this category conceive of sustainability with respect to consumption levels and investment in natural resources.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt; Examples include [[adjusted net savings]] (ANS) and [[ecological footprint]] accounts. ANS is calculated as the change in total wealth over a given time period, while ecological footprint assessments determine how much of the regenerative capacity of the biosphere is required to maintain the consumption habits of a defined population.&lt;ref name="Monfreda"&gt;C. Monfreda et al., [http://www.sze.hu/fk/kornyezet/cikkek8/kcx1415.pdf, "Establishing national natural capital accounts based on detailed Ecological Footprint and biological capacity assessments"], "Land Use Policy 21", 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The explicit emphasis on [[sustainability]] makes these indices useful; however computing them by country fails to capture the global nature of sustainability.

=== Monetary or physical indicators ===

All sustainability indicators can be grouped broadly into two types. Specifically, they will be calculated in monetary terms, using one or more valuation techniques, or in physical terms. It is more likely for monetary indicators to be expressed as flows, and physical indicators as stocks.

== Global initiatives ==

General commitment by the international community to support the development of natural capital accounting was motivated early on by the [[Brundtland Report]] in 1987 and the 1992 [[Rio Summit]].&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt; At the Summit in particular, [[Agenda 21]] – in which Chapter 40 called for signatories to develop quantitative information regarding their activities – was adopted.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt;

=== System of environmental-economic accounting ===

In September 1992, the Commission on the Environment of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) Permanent Council held a Seminar on Natural Resource and Environmental Accounts for Development Policy.&lt;ref name="OAS"&gt;Committee on the Environment
of the OAS Permanent Council, [http://www.oas.org/dsd/publications/Unit/oea38e/oea38e.pdf, "Natural Resource and Environmental Accounts for Development Policy"], "OAS Permanent Council", 13–14 April 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the country participants expressed interest in developing accounting capacities for natural resources.&lt;ref name="OAS" /&gt; A proposal was made at that time to create a program to coordinate and strengthen the efforts of countries and institutions undertaking such initiatives.&lt;ref name="OAS" /&gt;

The development of the first [[system of environmental-economic accounting]] (SEEA) in 1993 (SEEA-1993) was a major step towards establishing standards around integrating the environment into national accounts, and subsequently, environmentally-adjusting or "greening" macroeconomic indicators such as GDP.&lt;ref name="Joy"&gt;Joy Hecht, [http://www.eolss.net/Sample-Chapters/C13/E1-21-03-04.pdf, "The Evolving System of Integrated Economic and Environmental Accounts"], "Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems", 2004&lt;/ref&gt; While the SEEA-2003 and subsequent revisions being undertaken for 2013 have expanded the range of analyses within the framework, the purpose of the SEEA has remained the same. It is an accounting framework that records the stocks and flows that are relevant to both the environment and the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Committee of Experts on Environmental Economic Accounting, [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/seearev/Chapters/SEEA_CentralFramework_Ch1.pdf, "SEEA Central Framework"], "United Nations Statistics Division", 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Its Central Framework comprises three main accounts that can be integrated with the existing [[United Nations System of National Accounts]] (SNA), and each focuses on a different aspect of the interaction between the economy and the environment: physical flow accounts; functional accounts for environmental transactions; and asset accounts in physical and monetary terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/4655.0.55.002Appendix12013?opendocument&amp;tabname=Notes&amp;prodno=4655.0.55.002&amp;issue=2013&amp;num=&amp;view=, "Information Paper – Toward the Australian Environmental-Economic Accounts, 2013"], "Australian Bureau of Statistics", 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest version of the SEEA (Q3, 2012) has two other parts, aside from the Central Framework: SEEA Experimental Ecosystem Accounts and SEEA Extensions.&lt;ref name="Experimental"&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/seearev/Chapters/SEEA_EEA_v1.pdf, "SEEA Experimental Ecosystem Accounting – Consultation Draft"], "United Nations Statistics Division", 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The Experimental Ecosystem Accounts, specifically, introduces an accounting framework for ecosystems, despite the fact that many of its relevant stocks and flows are centered on non-market assets.&lt;ref name="Experimental" /&gt; While some of the measurement concepts involved in the accounting process are still evolving, it is possible that the eventual valuation of ecosystems and their depletion could be included in the calculations of environmentally-adjusted macroeconomic indicators. This has implications for future policy, since the emphasis on certain projects or activities undertaken by governments will likely change, depending on how the above-mentioned measurements impact their respective accounts, and subsequent environmental adjustments to certain indicators.

The London Group on Environmental Accounting and the UN Committee of Experts on Environmental-Economic Accounting are two groups, created in 1994 and 2005 respectively, to assist in the development of the SEEA and its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/seearev/, "SEEA Revision"], "United Nations Statistics Division", 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As well, the Working Group on Environmental Auditing, a subgroup of the [[International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions]], is working to improve auditing standards related to environmental issues.

=== Wealth Accounting and Ecosystem Partnership Services ===

The ability of developing countries to build their natural capital account capacities is being improved significantly through the Wealth Accounting and Ecosystem Partnership Services (WAVES), by encouraging the development of relevant measurement frameworks. WAVES is global partnership that was inaugurated in October 2010 by [[World Bank]] President [[Robert Zoellick]] at the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] COP-10 meeting in Japan.&lt;ref name="WAVES1"&gt;[http://www.wavespartnership.org/waves/about-us, "About Us"], "Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services", 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to promote sustainable development by encouraging the inclusion of natural capital measurements in national accounts. Several projects have been initiated in developing countries such as Botswana, Colombia and Madagascar with a view to improving their capacity to implement the SEEA, in collaboration with [[UNEP]], the [[UNDP]], the [[United Nations Statistical Commission]], and the financial support of NGOs and the governments of Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Norway and the United States.&lt;ref name="WAVES1" /&gt;

=== Ecological footprint accounts ===

Alternately, there have been many attempts to move away from integrated accounts, and towards novel sustainability indices or statistics. [[Ecological footprint]] accounts, developed by [[Mathis Wackernagel]] and [[William E. Rees]], and since 200, further developed by [[Global Footprint Network]], compare human demand against what the planet or a region can regenerate. An overview paper documenting the accounting method of the 20018 edition of the National Footprint Accounts was published by David Lin et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=David|last2=Hanscom|first2=Laurel|last3=Murthy|first3=Adeline|last4=Galli|first4=Alessandro|last5=Evans|first5=Mikel|last6=Neill|first6=Evan|last7=Mancini|first7=Maria|last8=Martindill|first8=Jon|last9=Medouar|first9=Fatime-Zahra|date=2018-09-17|title=Ecological Footprint Accounting for Countries: Updates and Results of the National Footprint Accounts, 2012–2018|url=https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/7/3/58|journal=Resources|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=58|doi=10.3390/resources7030058}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the proposal for nine planetary boundaries within which humans can safely operate, by Rockström et al., are projects which advocate for new approaches to global sustainability.&lt;ref name="Monfreda" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johan Rockstrom et al., [http://www.stockholmresilience.org/download/18.8615c78125078c8d3380002197/ES-2009-3180.pdf, "Planetary Boundaries: Exploring the Safe Operating Space for Humanity"], "Ecology and Society, 14:2", 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inclusive Wealth Index ===

The UN International Human Dimensions Programme has created an inclusive sustainability indicator, the [[Inclusive Wealth Index]] (IWI), which measures the productive bases of an economy: produced, natural and human capital, and based on these three assessments, calculates the trajectory of a country's wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Partha Dasgupta and Anantha Duraiappah, [http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/read/iwr-chapter-1, "Well-being and wealth"], "International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change", 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The calculation of natural capital in the IWI is based on the shadow value of an economy's natural capital assets.

A similar conceptual direction was taken by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, under the direction of economists Joseph Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Jean-Paul Fitoussi, at the behest of former French President Nicholas Sarkozy, in 2008. The authors concluded that a pragmatic measure of sustainability would combine an indicator based on the extended wealth approach, and a small dashboard of physical indicators.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz" /&gt;

While they have different theoretical underpinnings, what these approaches have in common with each other is a fundamental recognition of the limitations of traditional indicators in measuring economic performance and social progress, and the importance of sustainability in the long-run.

=== Beyond GDP ===

There have been several initiatives organized at the regional level that seek to move away from traditional GDP as the major indicator of wealth and well-being. The first of these is Beyond GDP, an initiative started by the EU in 2007 to develop highly aggregated environmental and social indicators and extend the national accounts to environmental and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beyond-gdp.eu/background.html, "About Beyond GDP"], "European Commission", 2007-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, the Summit for Sustainability in Africa was held in Gaborone, Botswana. It also brought together leaders from ten African countries to discuss sustainable development planning, and in particular, to commit to a set of goals on fully accounting for natural capital, and integrating it into national planning, reporting and policies. This commitment took the form of the ''[[Gaborone Declaration for Sustainability in Africa]]''&lt;ref name="fifty"&gt;[http://www.wavespartnership.org/waves/5050-initiative-next-steps, "The 50:50 Initiative: Next Steps"], "Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services", 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics of ecosystems and biodiversity ===

Four publications were presented at the CBD COP-10 by [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] (TEEB) initiative: TEEB Ecological and Economic Foundations, TEEB in National and International Policy Making, TEEB in Local and Regional Policy, and TEEB in Business and Enterprise.&lt;ref name="AboutTEEB"&gt;[http://www.teebweb.org/about/, "About TEEB"], "The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB)"&lt;/ref&gt; These, along with an Interim Report released at the CBD COP-9 in Bonn, Germany, represent a comprehensive analysis of the economic value of biodiversity, and the consequences it holds for different levels of public and private policy analysis.&lt;ref name="AboutTEEB" /&gt; TEEB also seeks to systematize the role of corporations, under the TEEB for Business Coalition (2012), by formulating standards and assessing externalities.&lt;ref name="Declaration"&gt;[http://www.naturalcapitaldeclaration.org/the-declaration/, "The Declaration"], "UNEP FI, GCP &amp; FGV", 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Since natural capital accounting requires the identification of replenishment activities as well as environmental degradation, the inclusion of corporations into the valuation process is key.

=== Natural Capital Declaration ===

In June 2012, the Rio+20 conference "marked a watershed in the world wide interest on Natural Capital Accounting".&lt;ref name="fifty" /&gt; The Natural Capital Declaration (NCD), a commitment by CEOs in the financial sector to embed ESG considerations in management and investment activities, was revealed prior to the conference.&lt;ref name="Declaration" /&gt; As well, the World Bank started the WAVES 50:50 Initiative to analyze the progress and next steps required for improving efforts to account for natural capital and enhance countries' sustainable decision-making capabilities.&lt;ref name="fifty" /&gt;  At the time of the conference, 62 countries, 90 corporations, and 17 civil society members had signed on to the campaign.&lt;ref name="fifty" /&gt;

== Country initiatives ==

Many countries are undertaking projects to develop environmental accounts, to integrate them with national accounts or to create environmentally-adjusted macroeconomic indicators, including Green GDP. Early adopters of integrated environmental-economic accounts include the Netherlands, France, and the Philippines. This section documents the initiatives undertaken by, or concerning the G20 countries.

===Argentina===

A team of researchers at the University of Buenos Aires and CONICET organized the ARKLEMS+LAND project. Their research, based on the KLEMS database framework (Capital, Labour, Energy, Material and Service Inputs), measures and analyses the sources of economic growth, productivity and competitiveness in the Argentinian economy.&lt;ref name="KLEMS"&gt;Ariel Coremberg, [http://www.econ.uba.ar/www/institutos/economia/Ceped/actividades/Seminario%20Interdisciplinario/Mesa%20Exposici%C3%B3n%201%20-%20Estructura,%20productividad%20y%20mercado%20de%20trabajo/Coremberg.pdf, "Measuring Productivity in Unstable and Natural Resources Dependent Economies: Argentina"], "Second World KLEMS Conference Harvard University", 9–10 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The database includes the contributions of "Natural Resource as Land and Subsoil Assets" services to GDP growth.&lt;ref name="KLEMS" /&gt;

Professor George Santopietro, at Radford University in Virginia, examined several alternative methods for estimating resource rent and relatedly, depletion costs of natural capital. The methods he engages with are: net price, El Serafy's depletion cost, sustainable price, transaction value and replacement cost.&lt;ref name="YPF"&gt;George Santopietro, [http://bbs.cenet.org.cn/uploadimages/20041292103137830.pdf, "Alternative methods for estimating resource rent and depletion cost: the case of Argentina's YPF"], "Resources Policy", 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He derives data from the privatization of Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF), Argentina's state-owned oil enterprise, and using each method, generates estimated resource rent and depletion cost values for Argentina's reserves of petroleum.&lt;ref name="YPF" /&gt; The results show that the net price and transaction value methods overvalue the resource rent of petroleum reserves. He concludes that rent should be derived using the value of a firm's stock.&lt;ref name="YPF" /&gt;

===Australia===

Several Australian organizations produce national environmental accounts. The Australian Bureau of Statistics produces Water Account Australia and a pilot Land Account for the Great Barrier Reef, both of which are based on the SEEA framework. The Bureau of Meteorology produces a complementary National Water Account on the water available to be used. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency reports on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists has created a trial, environmental accounting model that can be applied to regions of any size. These regional accounts use a common unit of measurement, which allows comparisons to be made between different natural capital assets. The Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment is in the process of developing experimental ecosystem accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bom.gov.au/environment/activities/accounts.shtml, "Environmental Accounts"], "Australian Bureau of Meteorology", 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy and water accounts found on the National Balance Sheet are produced annually.&lt;ref name="Yearbook"&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/0/F7B724440108BF5BCA25773700169D0D?opendocument, "Year Book Australia, 2009-10"], "Australian Bureau of Statistics", 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As well, subsoil assets, timber for producing logs, and land are valued monetarily, and included on the non-produced assets in the National Balance Sheet.&lt;ref name="Yearbook" /&gt; The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is currently working with several other national departments on the National Plan for Environmental Information (NPEI), the State of the Environment Report, and planning for national environmental accounts.

In 2012, following the adoption of the SEEA as an international statistical standard, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) also published a report titled "Completing the Picture – Environmental Accounting in Practice," which develops a number of accounting tables rooted in SEEA formatting, and explores how these could influence policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4628.0.55.001main+features10May+2012, "Completing the Picture – Environmental Accounting in Practice, May 2012"], Australian Bureau of Statistics", 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===

The UK produces Environmental Accounts, consistent with the SEEA framework, that are separated into three dimensions: natural resource accounts, physical flows and monetary accounts.&lt;ref name="UK"&gt;[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/agriculture-environment/environment/environmental-accounts, "Topic guide to: Environmental Accounts"], "UK National Statistics", 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the data is measured in physical units; monetary units are used where relevant, and if the necessary data is available.&lt;ref name="UK" /&gt;

The current environmental asset accounts produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) are: oil and gas reserves, forestry and land cover.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/environmental/uk-environmental-accounts/2011---blue-book-update/artnaturalcapital.html#tab-UK-experience-of-environmental-asset-accounting, "Towards a sustainable environment – UK natural capital and ecosystem economic accounting"], "Office for National Statistics", 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the ONS planned to run a study on producing a full ecosystem account, with high priority on physical and monetary forestry accounts.&lt;ref name="UK2"&gt;[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/environmental/uk-environmental-accounts/2011---blue-book-update/artnaturalcapital.html#tab-Conclusions-and-the-way-forward, "Towards a sustainable environment – UK natural capital and ecosystem economic accounting"], "Office for National Statistics", 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Office also set out a series of goals to include land use and cover accounts in the 2013 Environmental Accounts.&lt;ref name="UK2" /&gt;

The UK National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA) was a two-year initiative from 2009 to 2011 that assessed the benefits of the natural environment to society and the economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/, "What is the UK National Ecosystem Assessment"], "UK National Ecosystem Assessment", 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Government has pledged to develop full UK Environmental Accounts by 2020. This work is being led by the [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) and the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (Defra). The UK [[Natural Capital Committee]] is providing advice to help inform this project.
In December 2012, the ONS published a 'roadmap' that set out the work-plan for the project. 
The incorporation of natural capital into the national accounts, if done properly, would enable a high level picture to be obtained of trends in the state of the nation's natural assets through time.  This in turn would help demonstrate the implications of actions impacting on the natural environment and may, therefore, encourage policy-makers to ensure natural assets are in future used sustainably through the appropriate use of policy levers.

The [http://www.naturalcapitalcommittee.org/home.html Natural Capital Committee] is also developing a methodology for corporate natural capital accounting. It is undertaking a pilot project throughout 2014 with a range of organisations to test and refine this methodology and is encouraging organisations that own or manage land to develop [http://www.naturalcapitalcommittee.org/corporate-natural-capital-accounting.html corporate natural capital accounts].

===Brazil===

Despite reports that Brazil would produce a Green GDP in the lead-up to the Rio+20, there is no indication that this process was undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurofoodlaw.com/policy/environment/green-gdp-shapes-brazilian-food-production-policy--1.htm, "Green GDP shapes Brazilian food production policy"], "EU Food Law", 16 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Statistics Canada does not redefine or supplement existing national accounts aggregates with environmental information. However, it has developed the Canadian System of Environmental and Resource Accounts (CSERA), which "provides some information for those who may wish to calculate such "green aggregates.""&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/nea-cen/faq-foq/env-eng.htm#q2, "Environmental and resource accounts"], "Statistics Canada", 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes estimates of land in the "tangible non-produced assets" section of the Canadian balance sheet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Elva Bova, et al.,[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp1395.pdf, "Another Look at Governments' Balance Sheets: The Role of Non-financial Assets"], "International Monetary Fund", 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CSERA has three dimensions: Natural Resource Stock Accounts; Material and Energy Flow Accounts; and Environmental Protection Expenditure Accounts.&lt;ref name="Canada1"&gt;[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/16-505-g/16-505-g1997001-eng.pdf, "Concepts, Sources and Methods of the Canadian System of Environmental and Resource Accounts"], "Statistics Canada", 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Natural Resource Stock Accounts are measured in physical and monetary units.&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt; These, in turn, comprise natural resource wealth estimates that are included on the National Balance Sheet Accounts.

In 2005, the Pembina Institute published a report on the Canada Boreal Initiative, which sought to quantify the full economic value of goods and services provided by Canada's Boreal region. The Boreal Ecosystem Wealth Accounting System (BEWAS) was constructed for this purpose. It considered the physical conditions in the boreal region by using physical inventory and spatial data.&lt;ref name="Canada2"&gt;[http://www.borealcanada.ca/documents/Boreal_Wealth_Report_Nov_2005.pdf, "Counting Canada's Natural Capital: Assessing the real value of Canada's Boreal Ecosystems"], "Pembina Institute", 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The two-year study approximated the market value, for 2002, of the region's forestry, mining, oil and gas, and hydroelectric generation sectors at $48.9 billion.&lt;ref name="Canada2" /&gt;  For the same time period, it also estimated the net market value of natural capital extraction at $37.8 billion and the non-market value of ecosystem services at $93.2 billion.&lt;ref name="Canada2" /&gt;

Professor Nancy Olewiler, at Simon Fraser University, conducted several case studies to value natural capital in settled areas of Canada. Her agricultural lands case studies found the total net value of conservation efforts to be approximately $195/ha/yr in the Ontario Grand River Watershed, $65/ha/yr in the Upper Assiniboine River Basin and $126/ha/yr in the Prince Edward Island Mill River Watershed.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Olewiler, [https://www.sfu.ca/mpp-old/04research/pdfs/natural_capital.pdf, "The Value of Natural Capital in Settled Areas of Canada"], "Simon Fraser University", 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===

In 1997, Beijing authorities carried out a project assessing the city's Green GDP.&lt;ref name="China1"&gt;Vic Li and Graeme Lang, [https://www.academia.edu/1622586/Chinas_Green-GDP_Experiment_and_the_Struggle_for_Ecological_Modernization_by_Vic_Li_and_Graeme_Lang, "China's "Green GDP" Experiment and the Struggle for Ecological Modernization"], "Journal of Contemporary Asia, 40: 1", 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This set a series of precedents for environmentally adjusted indicators in the country. Over the next decade, several regional pilot projects were undertaken by local authorities. Between 2001 and 2004, Chinese authorities worked with Statistics Norway to carry out a Green GDP assessment of Chongqing.&lt;ref name="China1" /&gt;

Then, in 2004, the Green GDP Accounting Research Project was launched by the State Environmental Protection Administration of China (SEPA) and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The findings, released in the China Green National Accounting Study Report 2004 in 2006, reported that environmental pollution cost the economy 511.8 billion yuan or 3.5% of GDP in 2004.&lt;ref name="China2"&gt;Du Jing, [http://www.gov.cn/english/2006-09/11/content_384596.htm, "Green GDP Accounting Study Report 2004 issued"], "Chinese Government's Official Web Portal", 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A breakdown of the figure shows that water pollution, air pollution, and solid waste and accidents cost 286.28 billion yuan, 219.8 billion yuan, and 5.74 billion yuan, respectively.&lt;ref name="China2" /&gt; According to the report, only about ten of the items the project intended to distinguish were accounted for.&lt;ref name="China2" /&gt; The costs of resource depletion and ecological damage were not included in the calculations because of methodological difficulties, limited technological capabilities and a lack of relevant data.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/kqed/chinainside/nature/greengdp.html, "Opinion: Green GDP"], "Public Broadcasting Station", 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as the report was released, SEPA Vice Minister Zhu Guangya issued an independent report stating that each year, environmental damage in the country cost approximately 10% of GDP.&lt;ref name="PBS" /&gt; This estimate was consistent with the one that scientists, economists and the World Bank had expected, of 8-12% of GDP.

The government withdrew its official support for Green GDP in 2007, after early results showed the reduction of growth rates in some provinces to nearly zero. It also did not release an official Green GDP report for 2005, which had been scheduled for publication in March 2007.

Reports have periodically surfaced about re-calculating China's green GDP. In 2007, the All-China Environment Federation (ACEF) called on the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to carry out a national accounting system.&lt;ref&gt;Sun Xiaohua, [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-04/19/content_853917.htm, "Call for return to green accounting"], "China Daily", 19 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ''China Daily'' reported that the Ministry of Environmental Protection valued the cost of pollution to the economy at 1.4 trillion yuan in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lelyveld, [http://www.rfa.org/english/commentaries/energy_watch/greengdp-02132012120520.html, "China's 'Green GDP' Resurfaces"], "Radio Free Asia", 13 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1998, the NBS developed rudimentary environmental accounts in forestry and energy. Since then, the NBS has expanded its environmental accounts to include pollution treatment, water, and minerals, along with the development of a comprehensive SEEA for China.&lt;ref name="China1" /&gt;

===European Union===

The interaction between Eurostat and national statistical offices of EU Member States was formalized in 2011, by the adoption of Regulation No 691 on European Environmental Economic Accounts. It requires Member States to report data and accounts on air emissions, taxes related to the environment, and material flows from 2012.&lt;ref name="EU1"&gt;Leonardo Mazza and Patrick ten Brink, [http://www.ieep.eu/assets/1111/Background_paper_on_Indicators_and_accounts_in_the_7th_EAP.pdf, "Improving Measurement to Manage Through the 7th EAP: The Role of Indicators and Accounting"], "Institute for European Environmental Policy", 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Eurostat is also constructing environmental accounts expressed in physical and monetary terms, and asset accounts, as a step towards developing a regional SEEA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/environmental_accounts/introduction, "What do environmental accounts measure?"], "Eurostat", 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of inclusive wealth indicators is also a recognized priority of the EU. The proposed 7th Environment Action Programme (EAP) of the EC explicitly identifies this issue, by calling for further development and integration of economic and environmental indicators. The Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS) proposes to streamline the collection of data required for designing environmental indicators.&lt;ref name="EU1" /&gt; The EU also committed to the Aichi Accord at the CBD COP-10, in which Parties agree to integrate biodiversity into their national accounts.&lt;ref name="EU1" /&gt; This is on top of the experimental ecosystem accounting framework that was launched in 2009. The European Environment Agency (EEA) proposed that given the compatibility of the design with the SNA, it would be possible to use one particular indicator, Consumption of Ecosystem Capital (CEC) to adjust National Accounts aggregates to create, in particular, CEC Adjusted Net Domestic Product and CEC Adjusted Net National Income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/an-experimental-framework-for-ecosystem, "An experimental framework for ecosystem capital accounting in Europe"], "European Environment Agency", 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The EC Communication Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe sets 2020 as the year by which businesses, along with public authorities, will properly account for natural capital and ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/resource_efficiency/pdf/com2011_571.pdf, "Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe"], "European Commission", 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===

The French Ministry of Sustainable Development produces satellite, environmental-economic accounts each year.&lt;ref name="France"&gt;Frédéric Nauroy, [http://www.wavespartnership.org/waves/sites/waves/files/documents/Second%20Partnership%20Meeting/France_WAVES_Presentation.pdf, " France's Commitment to Environmental Accounting"], "Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development, Housing and Transport", 22 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is planning on fully expanding the accounts to correspond with the SEEA (2012).&lt;ref name="France" /&gt; The National Institute of Statistics and Economics also includes estimates of land, subsoil assets, and non-cultivated bio and water resources in the "tangible non-produced assets" section of the French balance sheet.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

From 2008 to 2010, an exploratory study on ecosystem valuation was carried out.&lt;ref name="France" /&gt; In accordance with the adoption of the Aichi Accord at the CBD COP-10, the French National Biodiversity Strategy Target 7 was set to "include preservation of biodiversity in economic decisions."&lt;ref name="France" /&gt; The Ministry of Sustainable Development is presently consulting with stakeholders and refining methodological options in order to begin assembling physical ecosystem assessments.&lt;ref name="France" /&gt; Annual expert workshops on monetary valuation and economic instruments are also organized by the Ministry.&lt;ref name="France" /&gt;

===Germany===

The German Environmental Economic Accounts (GEEA) follow the SEEA framework. The data from these accounts, along with the German Socio-economic Accounts, is used to calculate an indicator set, as outlined in the National Strategy for Sustainable Development (2002).&lt;ref name="Germany"&gt;Karl Schoer, [https://www.destatis.de/EN/Publications/Specialized/EnvironmentalEconomicAccounting/Policyuse.pdf?__blob=publicationFile, "Policy use of Environmental-Economic Accounting in Germany"], "Federal Statistical Office Germany", 2005&lt;/ref&gt; While no adjusted macroeconomic aggregates are estimated in the GEEA, two of the GEEA indicators are embedded into the National Accounts: productivity of energy and raw materials, and transport intensity and share of the railways in providing transport.&lt;ref name="Germany" /&gt;

===India===

An Expert Group, led by IHDP Scientific Committee chairman Professor Partha Dasgupta, is in the process of developing a system to "green" India's national accounts.&lt;ref name="India1"&gt;[http://www.ihdp.unu.edu/article/read/ihdp-scientific-committee-chair-sir-partha-dasgupta-to-lead, "IHDP Scientific Committee chair Sir Partha Dasgupta to lead India's Green National Accounts Committee"], "International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change", 12 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It plans to adjust GDP to account for environmental costs and impacts by 2015.&lt;ref name="India1" /&gt; Some of the issues the Group will address include establishing coordination mechanisms within the country and with international partners, and standardizing data collection and valuation methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;S. Suresh Kumar, [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/londongroup/meeting18/LG18_p27_Green%20National%20Accounts%20for%20India%20-%20The%20State%20of%20Progress.pdf, "Green National Accounts for India"], "UN Statistics", 2–4 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Accounting for Indian States Project (GAISP) was the first initiative of the Green Indian States Trust (GIST), an NGO started in 2004.&lt;ref name="GAISP"&gt;[http://www.gistindia.org/, "Green Accounting for Indian States Project"], "Green Indian States Trust", 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Project used data from Indian national databases to measure sustainable development and create green accounts at the state-level that were consistent with SEEA-2003 guidelines.&lt;ref name="GAISP" /&gt; Following this, GIST calculated a Green GDP total which adjusted the traditional indicator for "all major externalities."&lt;ref name="GAISP" /&gt;

The South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE) and the Indian Society for Ecological Economics operate in India, although SANDEE is based in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandeeonline.org/about_us.php, "About Us"], "South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics", 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Both are networks that conduct research on and analyses of environmental accounting, which is instructive for teachers, researchers and members of the policy community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoinsee.org/], "Indian Society for Ecological Economics", 8 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===

Members of the World Resources Institute, led by David Repetto, integrated environmental effects into Indonesia's national accounts in 1990.&lt;ref name="Asafu"&gt;John Asafu-Adjaye, [http://www.unescap.org/pdd/publications/dp25/dp25_ch4.pdf, "Green National Accounting and the Measurement of Genuine (Extended) Saving"], "United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific", 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He subtracted net natural resource depreciation for the petroleum, timber, and soils sectors from GDP to estimate the environmentally-adjusted NDP.&lt;ref name="Asafu" /&gt; They found that estimates of net income and growth of net income were overstated when calculated using the conventional accounts.&lt;ref name="Joy" /&gt;

In 1997, the United Nations University-Institute of Advanced Studies (UNU-IAS) measured the environmental impacts of industrialization and trade in Indonesia (along with China and Japan).&lt;ref name="UNUIAS"&gt;[http://www.ias.unu.edu/sub_page.aspx?catID=97&amp;ddlID=360, "Green GDP Estimates in China, Indonesia, and Japan: An Application of the UN Environmental and Economic Accounting System"], "United Nations University – Institute of Advanced Studies", 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In their study, the UNU-IAS constructed an international environmental input-output model for the Asia Pacific region, and from this, was able to compile a preliminary SEEA and Green GDP approximation.&lt;ref name="UNUIAS" /&gt; In 1990, environmental costs were equal to 4.9% of NDP for Indonesia. In particular, changes in land use and oil exploitation were major costs.&lt;ref name="UNUIAS" /&gt;

Since 2002, Statistics Indonesia (BPS) has produced several Indicators of Sustainable Development reports, based on the 134 UN Commission on Sustainable Development Indicators developed by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. BPS also regularly generates environmental statistics and statistics of marine and coastal resources.

===Italy===

The National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) currently constructs three types of environmental accounting modules: material flows (MFA), the environmental account matrix integrated with national economic account (NAMEA), and the expenditure estimate for environmental protection (SERIEE-EPEA).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/agenda21/natlinfo/countr/italy/Italian%20NSDS.pdf, "Environmental Action Strategy for Sustainable Development in Italy"], "Ministry for the Environment and Territory", 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Silvia Teizzi at the University of Sienna applied a method of monetary valuation to externalities arising from agricultural production in Italy.&lt;ref name="Silvia"&gt;Silvia Teizzi, [http://econpapers.repec.org/article/kapenreec/v_3a13_3ay_3a1999_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a459-472.htm, "External Effects of Agricultural Production in Italy and Environmental Accounting"], "Environmental and Resource Economics, 13: 4", 1999&lt;/ref&gt; She separately estimated a shadow price and a quantity for the externalities and calculated their values between for each year between 1961 and 1991.&lt;ref name="Silvia" /&gt; She subtracted these figures from the value added of the agricultural sector "as a first step towards the correction of national accounting aggregates to take environmental degradation into account."&lt;ref name="Silvia" /&gt;

In their case study on Trento, Italy, Professors Andrea Francesconi and Paolo Penasa analyze the accounting schemes for environmental expenditures developed by local governments in Italy.&lt;ref name="Andrea"&gt;Andrea Francesconi and Paola Penasa, [http://sydney.edu.au/business/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/56601/Environmental_Accounting_for_Local_Govt.pdf, "Environmental accounting for Local Government. The experience of the Municipality of Trento, Italy"], University of Sydney"&lt;/ref&gt; Under the local Agenda 21 process, the City and Local Environmental Accounting and Reporting (CLEAR) project and the CONTAROMA project were undertaken by Italian municipalities.&lt;ref name="Andrea" /&gt; The CLEAR project was started in 2001 to pair the financial statements of municipalities with an environmental report.&lt;ref name="Andrea" /&gt; The CLEAR method reclassified the aforementioned financial statements such that expenditures for environmental purposes could be identified, and compiled into separate monetary accounts.&lt;ref name="Andrea" /&gt; Similarly, the CONTAROMA project developed an environmental accounting system for the municipal budget of Rome.&lt;ref name="Andrea" /&gt;

===Japan===

In 1995, the Japanese Economic Planning Agency made initial estimates of the SEEA and Green GDP from 1985 to 1990.&lt;ref name="UNUIAS" /&gt; In 1998, they extended their estimates from 1970 to 1995.&lt;ref name="UNUIAS" /&gt; According to these calculations, environmental costs in Japan fell from 8% of NDP in 1970 to nearly 1% in 1995.&lt;ref name="UNUIAS" /&gt;

The E-10 are the official economic-environmental accounts produced by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment.&lt;ref name="Japan"&gt;[http://www.env.go.jp/en/statistics/contents/pdfdata/201203_e.pdf, "Towards development of the Input-Output Tables for Environmental Analysis"], "Ministry of the Environment", March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; They are based on data compiled by 10 government ministries, and describe the environmental burden of particular natural resources in physical units.&lt;ref name="Japan" /&gt; There are three tables which make up the E-10: a Basic Transaction Table; resource and environmental burden tables; and supplementary tables.&lt;ref name="Japan" /&gt;

The Statistics Bureau of Japan currently includes estimates of land in the "tangible non-produced assets" section of the Japanese balance sheet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Republic of Korea===

In 2001, the Korean Ministry of the Environment planned to introduce an environmentally-adjusted GDP indicator.&lt;ref name="Korea1"&gt;[http://eng.me.go.kr/content.do?method=moveContent&amp;menuCode=pol_pol_com_intergrated, "Integrated Index of Environment and Economy"], "Ministry of Environment"&lt;/ref&gt; It began developing a SEEA (KORSEEA) in 2002, and the development of Economy-wide Material Flow Accounts, and NAMEA took place in the following years.&lt;ref name="Korea1" /&gt; Several government institutions and departments provide economic and environmental data required for the KORSEEA. Statistics Korea also includes estimates of land, subsoil assets, and non-cultivated bio and water resources in the "tangible non-produced assets" section of the Koreah balance sheet.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The Korea Rural Economic Institute calculated the Green GDP of the Korean agricultural sector in the period 1980 to 1997 using pilot economic-environmental accounts.&lt;ref name="Korea2"&gt;[http://www.unescap.org/stat/envstat/stwes-24.pdf, "Pilot Compilation of Environmental-Economic Accounts in Korean Agricultural Sector"], "Korea Rural Economic Institute", 8–19 May 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental adjustment in this study is limited to the subtraction of "degradation costs of natural resources" from NDP.&lt;ref name="Korea2" /&gt; They report that the ratio of environmentally adjusted domestic product to NDP decreases from 100.6% to 99.5% in the agricultural sector during the specified period.&lt;ref name="Korea2" /&gt;

===Mexico===

In 1985, the UN, World Bank and Mexican government executed a joint pilot project using 1985 data to produce two environmentally-adjusted indicators: resource depletion subtracted from NDP and environmental degradation subtracted from NDP.&lt;ref name="Mexico"&gt;Raúl Figueroa Díaz et al., [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/green_economy/korea/presentations/Grreen%20Growth.pdf, "Economic and Environmental Accounting and Green Growth"], "National Institute of Statistics and Geography of Mexico", July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican System of Economic and Ecological Accounts (MSEEA) was started in 1988, and has been published annually since 1991.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; The National Institute of Statistics and Geography of Mexico (INEGI) have used the accounts to derive key information about environmental sustainability in the country. Yearly environmental costs are equal to 8.5% of GDP. Since 2003, the INEGI has calculated a yearly Green GDP aggregate.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; Between 2003 and 2009, the ratio of Green GDP to GDP increased from 90.4% to 92.1%.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt; The INEGI reports that while the scope of action should be increased, this trend reflects the successful efforts of the government to reduce impacts that negatively affect the environment.&lt;ref name="Mexico" /&gt;

===Russia===

The Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) currently includes estimates of land and non-cultivated bio and water resources in the "tangible non-produced assets" section of the Russian balance sheet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rosstat has outlined a series of priorities for developing a Russian SEEA. Its highest priority is asset accounts, and with respect to the environment, a particular record of environmental protection expenditures.&lt;ref name="Russia"&gt;[unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/ceea/meetings/UNCEEA-7-7-4.ppt, "Development of Environmental Accounts in Russia: Plans and Experience"], "Federal State Statistics Service, Russian Federation", 11–13 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; After 2015, the basis for integration will appear with the creation of input-output tables.&lt;ref name="Russia" /&gt; Physical flow accounts are a medium priority; further development will depend on the completion of the input-output tables and whether new surveys are introduced on time.&lt;ref name="Russia" /&gt; While accounts for extended SNA aggregates, such as the depletion or degradation of natural capital are being given conceptual consideration, they are the lowest priority of Rosstat.&lt;ref name="Russia" /&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===

Saudi Arabia has not undertaken any relevant initiatives.

===South Africa===

The environmental-economic accounts are developed in the National Accounts Division of Statistics South Africa (SA). Information for the accounts is sourced from various government departments, surveys and geographic and spatial data.&lt;ref name="SA"&gt;Riaan Grobler, [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/green_economy/korea/presentations/Stats%20SA%20Position%20on%20environmental%20statistics.PDF, "Statistics South Africa's position on environmental statistics"], "Statistics South Africa", 6–8 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2011 report to the United Nations, environmental statistics are not a mainstream priority for the country, and Statistics SA does not have adequate resources to collect environmental data.&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; Additionally, a "lengthy institutionalization process" has prevented the publication of any official reports.&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt;

===Turkey===

The Turkish Statistical Institute produces a range of environmental statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/PreTablo.do?alt_id=10, "Environment and Energy"], "Turkish Statistical Institute", 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===

In 1992, the Bureau of Economic Analysis within the Department of Commerce began intensively developing environmental accounting methodologies.&lt;ref name="NN"&gt;William Nordhaus and Edward Kokkelenberg, [http://training.fws.gov/bart/Resources/nrdar/injury_quantification/Natures's_Numbers.pdf, "Natures Numbers: Expanding the National Economic Accounts to Include the Environment"], "National Academy Press", 1999&lt;/ref&gt; However, Congress directed the Department to suspend all activities in this area in 1994, after the first U.S. Integrated Environmental and Economic Satellite Accounts were published.&lt;ref name="NN" /&gt; It also ordered an external review of environmental accounting. This review, Nature's Numbers: Expanding the National Economic Accounts to Include the Environment was concluded in 1999.&lt;ref name="NN" /&gt;

William Nordhaus (Nature's Numbers), along with Nicholas Muller and Robert Mendelsohn, co-authored a study on integrating environmental externalities into a SNA. Their model estimates gross damages from air pollution in each industry in the United States. It estimates that damages from activities such as combustion of waste, sewage treatment and firing power plants by oil or coal are larger than their value added.&lt;ref name="US"&gt;Nicholas Muller et al., [www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.101.5.1649, " Environmental Accounting for Pollution in the United States Economy"], "American Economic Review", August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The largest externalities, for which damages range from 0.8 to 5.6 times value added, arise from coal-fired electric generation.&lt;ref name="US" /&gt;

==History==

According to Doogab Yi, by the late 1970s NEEC had been transformed into "several commercial biotech companies."&lt;ref name="scientific_commons_2009" /&gt;

[[Roscoe Brady|Roscoe O. Brady]] and his colleagues at [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) were almost ready for a clinical trial for an enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher's disease that they had been working on for over a decade.&lt;ref name="Goozne_2005"&gt;{{citation |title=The $800 Million Pill: The Truth Behind the Cost of New Drugs |author=Merrill Goozne |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520246706 |date=October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}} They could not purify the enzyme in large enough quantities.&lt;ref name="Goozne_2005" /&gt;{{rp|44}}

{{quote|"They contracted with Henry Blair, who had worked at NIH with Brady but left to form the New England Enzyme Center at Tufts University Medical School in Boston. Supported soley by contracts from Brady's lab, Blair set up a lab for large-scale purification and began collecting fresh placentas. In 1981, with NIH getting ready to move into larger clinical trials and biotechnology fever exploding around him, Blair privatized his venture. He launched Genzyme, with the NIH as its major source of revenue."|Goozne 2005:44}}

Blair had started his career in the biotechnology industry working as a technician at Tufts medical school.&lt;ref name="Tufts_Blair_1981"&gt;{{citation |url=http://now.tufts.edu/articles/flair-business-medicine |title=A Flair for the Business of Medicine: Genzyme founder Henry Blair started his career working as a technician at Tufts medical school |author=Bruce Morgan |date=April 12, 2012 |publisher=Tufts Now |accessdate=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PharmaTelevision_Genzyme_2012" /&gt; In 1978 Henry E.

Olbers's paradox argues that as the night sky is dark, at least one of these three assumptions about the nature of the universe must be false.|alt=In this animation depicting an infinite and homogeneous sky, successively more distant stars are revealed in each frame. As the animation progresses, the more distant stars fill the gaps between closer stars in the field of view. Eventually, the entire image is as bright as a single star.]]
In [[astrophysics]] and [[physical cosmology]], '''Olbers' paradox''', named after the [[Germany|German]] astronomer [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers|Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers]] (1758–1840), also known as the "'''dark night sky paradox'''", is the argument that the darkness of the night sky conflicts with the assumption of an infinite and eternal [[static universe]]. The darkness of the night sky is one of the pieces of evidence for a dynamic universe, such as the [[Lambda-CDM model|Big Bang model]]. In the hypothetical case that the universe is static, homogeneous at a large scale, and populated by an infinite number of [[star]]s, then any line of sight from [[Earth]] must end at the (very bright) surface of a star and hence the night sky should be completely illuminated and very bright. This contradicts the observed darkness and non-uniformity of the night.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150803"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=The Flip Side of Optimism About Life on Other Planets |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/space/the-flip-side-of-optimism-about-life-on-other-planets.html |date=August 3, 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=October 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The first one to address the problem of infinite number of stars and the resulting heat in the Cosmos was [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]], a Greek monk from [[Alexandria]], who states in his ''[[Topographia Christiana]]'': "The crystal-made sky sustains the heat of the Sun, the moon, and the infinite number of stars, otherwise, it would have been full of fire, and it could melt or set on fire".&lt;ref&gt;“Cosmas Indicopleustès. Topographie chrétienne, 3 vols.”, Ed. Wolska–Conus, W.Paris: Cerf, 1:1968; 2:1970; 3:1973; Sources chrétiennes, Book 10, section 27, line 7 “Cosmas Indicopleustès.

[[Edward Robert Harrison]]'s ''Darkness at Night: A Riddle of the Universe'' (1987) gives an account of the dark night sky paradox, seen as a problem in the history of science. According to Harrison, the first to conceive of anything like the paradox was [[Thomas Digges]], who was also the first to expound the Copernican system in English and also postulated an infinite universe with infinitely many stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Scientific Revolution: The Essential Readings|volume=7|series=Blackwell Essential Readings in History|editor-first=Marcus|editor-last=Hellyer|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|date=2008|isbn=9780470754771|page=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1VhC63yV-WgC&amp;pg=PA63|quotation=The Puritan Thomas Digges (1546–1595?) was the earliest Englishman to offer a defense of the Copernican theory. ... Accompanying Digges's account is a diagram of the universe portraying the heliocentric system surrounded by the orb of fixed stars, described by Digges as infinitely extended in all dimensions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] also posed the problem in 1610, and the paradox took its mature form in the 18th century work of [[Edmond Halley|Halley]] and [[Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux|Cheseaux]].&lt;ref name="new cosmos"&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Cosmos: An Introduction to Astronomy and Astrophysics|series=Physics and astronomy online|first1=Albrecht|last1=Unsöld|first2=Bodo|last2=Baschek|publisher=Springer|date=2001|isbn=9783540678779|page=485|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNnmR8ljctoC&amp;pg=PA485|quotation=The simple observation that the night sky is dark allows far-reaching conclusions to be drawn about the large-scale structure of the universe.

Olbers (1826).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox is commonly attributed to the [[Germany|German]] amateur [[astronomer]] [[Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers]], who described it in 1823, but Harrison shows convincingly that Olbers was far from the first to pose the problem, nor was his thinking about it particularly valuable. Harrison argues that the first to set out a satisfactory resolution of the paradox was [[Lord Kelvin]], in a little known 1901 paper,&lt;ref&gt;For a key extract from this paper, see Harrison (1987), pp. 227–28.&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s essay ''[[Eureka: A Prose Poem|Eureka]]'' (1848) curiously anticipated some qualitative aspects of Kelvin's argument:&lt;ref name="NYT-20150803" /&gt;
{{quote|Were the succession of stars endless, then the background of the sky would present us a uniform luminosity, like that displayed by the Galaxy – since there could be absolutely no point, in all that background, at which would not exist a star. The only mode, therefore, in which, under such a state of affairs, we could comprehend the voids which our telescopes find in innumerable directions, would be by supposing the distance of the invisible background so immense that no ray from it has yet been able to reach us at all.&lt;ref name="eureka"&gt;{{cite news|title=Eureka: A Prose Poem|author=Poe, Edgar Allan|date=1848|url=http://books.eserver.org/poetry/poe/eureka.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426162441/http://books.eserver.org/poetry/poe/eureka.html|archivedate=2008-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The paradox==
The paradox is that a static, infinitely old universe with an infinite number of stars distributed in an infinitely large space would be bright rather than dark.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150803" /&gt;

[[File:Olbers' Paradox.svg|thumb|A view of a square section of four concentric shells]]
To show this, we divide the universe into a series of concentric shells, 1 light year thick. A certain number of stars will be in the shell 1,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,001 light years away. If the universe is homogeneous at a large scale, then there would be four times as many stars in a second shell, which is between 2,000,000,000 and 2,000,000,001 light years away. However, the second shell is twice as far away, so each star in it would appear one quarter as bright as the stars in the first shell. Thus the total light received from the second shell is the same as the total light received from the first shell.

Thus each shell of a given thickness will produce the same net amount of light regardless of how far away it is. That is, the light of each shell adds to the total amount. Thus the more shells, the more light; and with infinitely many shells, there would be a bright night sky.

While dark clouds could obstruct the light, these clouds would heat up, until they were as hot as the stars, and then radiate the same amount of light.

Kepler saw this as an argument for a finite [[observable universe]], or at least for a finite number of stars. In [[general relativity theory]], it is still possible for the paradox to hold in a finite universe:&lt;ref&gt;D'Inverno, Ray. ''Introducing Einstein's Relativity'', Oxford, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; though the sky would not be infinitely bright, every point in the sky would still be like the surface of a star.

==The mainstream explanation==
{{See also|Redshift|Lambda-CDM model|metric expansion of space}}
The poet [[Edgar Allan Poe]] suggested that the finite size of the observable universe resolves the apparent paradox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/poe/eureka.html |title=Poe: Eureka |publisher=Xroads.virginia.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, because the universe is [[Age of the universe|finitely old]] and the speed of light is finite, only finitely many stars can be observed from Earth (although the whole universe can be infinite in space).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm – Brief Answers to Cosmic Questions&lt;/ref&gt; The density of stars within this finite volume is sufficiently low that any line of sight from Earth is unlikely to reach a star.

However, the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] introduces a new paradox: it states that the sky was much brighter in the past, especially at the end of the [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] era, when it first became transparent. All points of the local sky at that era were comparable in brightness to the surface of the Sun, due to the high temperature of the universe in that [[Graphical timeline of the Big Bang|era]]; and most light rays will terminate not in a star but in the relic of the Big Bang.

This paradox is explained by the fact that the Big Bang theory also involves the [[expansion of space]], which can cause the energy of emitted light to be reduced via [[redshift]]. More specifically, the extreme levels of radiation from the [[Big Bang]] have been redshifted to microwave wavelengths (1100 times the length of its original wavelength) as a result of the cosmic expansion, and thus forms the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. This explains the relatively low light densities present in most of our sky despite the assumed bright nature of the Big Bang. The redshift also affects light from distant stars and [[quasar]]s, but the diminution is minor, since [[List of most distant astronomical object record holders|the most distant galaxies and quasars]] have redshifts of only around 5 to 8.6.

==Alternative explanations==

===Steady state===
The redshift hypothesised in the Big Bang model would by itself explain the darkness of the night sky even if the Universe were infinitely old. The [[Steady state theory|steady state]] cosmological model assumed that the Universe is infinitely old and uniform in time as well as space. There is no Big Bang in this model, but there are stars and quasars at arbitrarily great distances. The expansion of the Universe causes the light from these distant stars and quasars to redshift (by the [[Doppler effect]] and [[thermalisation]]&lt;ref&gt;http://physicsessays.org/doi/abs/10.4006/1.3028952?journalCode=phes{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} – Gilles Corriveau: The 3 K Background Emission, the Formation of Galaxies, and the Large‐Scale Structure of the Universe {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), so that the total light flux from the sky remains finite. Thus the observed radiation density (the sky brightness of [[extragalactic background light]]) can be independent of finiteness of the Universe. Mathematically, the total electromagnetic energy density (radiation energy density) in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] from [[Planck's law]] is

:&lt;math&gt;{U\over V} = \frac{8\pi^5(kT)^4}{15 (hc)^3},&lt;/math&gt;

e.g. for temperature 2.7&amp;nbsp;K it is 40&amp;nbsp;fJ/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;4.5×10&lt;sup&gt;−31&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and for visible temperature 6000&amp;nbsp;K we get 1&amp;nbsp;J/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;1.1×10&lt;sup&gt;−17&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. But the total radiation emitted by a star (or other cosmic object) is at most equal to the total [[nuclear binding energy]] of [[isotope]]s in the star. For the density of the [[observable universe]] of about 4.6×10&lt;sup&gt;−28&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and given the known [[abundance of the chemical elements]], the corresponding maximal radiation energy density of 9.2×10&lt;sup&gt;−31&lt;/sup&gt; kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. temperature 3.2&amp;nbsp;K (matching the value observed for the optical radiation temperature by [[Arthur Eddington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/Eddington-T0.html| title=Eddington's Temperature of Space|last=Wright|first=Edward L.|date=23 Oct 2006|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://webdev.archive.org/stream/TheInternalConstitutionOfTheStars/Eddington-TheInternalConstitutionOfTheStars#page/n379/mode/2up| title=Eddington's 3.18°K "Temperature of Interstellar Space"|pages=371–372|work=The Internal Constitution of the Stars| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|last=Eddington|first=A.S.|date=1926|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This is close to the summed energy density of the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) and the [[cosmic neutrino background]]. The Big Bang hypothesis predicts that the CBR should have the same energy density as the binding energy density of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|the primordial helium]], which is much greater than the binding energy density of the non-primordial elements; so it gives almost the same result. However, the steady-state model does not predict the angular distribution of the microwave background temperature accurately (as the standard ΛCDM paradigm does).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright, E.

===Finite age of stars===
Stars have a finite age and a finite power, thereby implying that each star has a finite impact on a sky's light field density. [[Edgar Allan Poe]] suggested that this idea could provide a resolution to Olbers' paradox; a related theory was also proposed by [[Jean-Philippe de Chéseaux]]. However, stars are continually being born as well as dying. As long as the density of stars throughout the universe remains constant, regardless of whether the universe itself has a finite or infinite age, there would be infinitely many other stars in the same angular direction, with an infinite total impact. So the finite age of the stars does not explain the paradox.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Cosmological Enigmas: Pulsars, Quasars, and Other Deep-Space Questions|first=Mark|last=Kidger|publisher=[[JHU Press]]|date=2008|isbn=9780801893353|contribution=The Mortality of the Stars|pages=144–145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ierprKpJGQoC&amp;pg=PT182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brightness===
Suppose that the universe were not expanding, and always had the same stellar density; then the temperature of the universe would continually increase as the stars put out more radiation. Eventually, it would reach 3000&amp;nbsp;K (corresponding to a typical photon energy of 0.3 [[electron-volts|eV]] and so a frequency of 7.5×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; [[Hertz|Hz]]), and the photons would begin to be absorbed by the hydrogen plasma filling most of the universe, rendering outer space opaque. This maximal radiation density corresponds to about {{val|1.2|e=17}} eV/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = {{val|2.1|e=-19|u=kg/m3}}, which is much greater than the observed value of {{val|4.7|e=-31|u=kg/m3}}.&lt;ref name="new cosmos"/&gt; So the sky is about five hundred billion times darker than it would be if the universe was neither expanding nor too young to have reached equilibrium yet. However, recent observations increasing the lower bound on the number of galaxies suggest UV absorption by hydrogen and reemission in near-IR (not visible) wavelengths also plays a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conselice|first1=Christopher|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Aaron|last3=Duncan|first3=Kenneth|last4=Mortlock|first4=Alice|title=THE EVOLUTION OF GALAXY NUMBER DENSITY AT z &lt; 8 AND ITS IMPLICATIONS|journal=Astrophys.

===Fractal star distribution===
A different resolution, which does not rely on the Big Bang theory, was first proposed by [[Carl Charlier]] in 1908 and later rediscovered by [[Benoit Mandelbrot|Benoît Mandelbrot]] in 1974. They both postulated that if the stars in the universe were distributed in a hierarchical [[fractal cosmology]] (e.g., similar to [[Cantor dust]])—the average density of any region diminishes as the region considered increases—it would not be necessary to rely on the Big Bang theory to explain Olbers' paradox. This model would not rule out a Big Bang, but would allow for a dark sky even if the Big Bang had not occurred.

Mathematically, the light received from stars as a function of star distance in a hypothetical fractal cosmos is:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{light}=\int_{r_0}^\infty L(r) N(r)\,dr&lt;/math&gt;

where:

''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = the distance of the nearest star. ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0;

''r'' = the variable measuring distance from the Earth;

''L''(''r'') = average [[luminosity]] per star at distance ''r'';

''N''(''r'') = number of stars at distance ''r''.

The function of luminosity from a given distance ''L''(''r'')''N''(''r'') determines whether the light received is finite or infinite. For any luminosity from a given distance ''L''(''r'')''N''(''r'') proportional to ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\text{light}&lt;/math&gt; is infinite for ''a''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;−1 but finite for ''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;−1. So if ''L''(''r'') is proportional to ''r''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, then for &lt;math&gt;\text{light}&lt;/math&gt; to be finite, ''N''(''r'') must be proportional to ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''b''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1. For ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the numbers of stars at a given radius is proportional to that radius. When integrated over the radius, this implies that for ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the ''total'' number of stars is proportional to ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This would correspond to a [[fractal dimension]] of 2. Thus the fractal dimension of the universe would need to be less than 2 for this explanation to work.

This explanation is not widely accepted among cosmologists since the evidence suggests that the fractal dimension of the universe is at least 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joyce, M. |display-authors=4 |author2=Labini, F.S. |author3=Gabrielli, A. |author4=Montouri, M. |author5=Pietronero, L. |date=2005 |title=Basic Properties of Galaxy Clustering in the light of recent results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=443 |issue=11 |arxiv=astro-ph/0501583 | doi= 10.1051/0004-6361:20053658 |pages=11–16 |bibcode=2005A&amp;A...443...11J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Labini, F.S. |author2=Vasilyev, N.L. |author3=Pietronero, L. |author4=Baryshev, Y. |date=2009 |title=Absence of self-averaging and of homogeneity in the large scale galaxy distribution |journal=Europhys.

'''Physical literacy''' is a fundamental and valuable human capability that can be described as a disposition acquired by human individuals encompassing the motivation, confidence, physical competence, knowledge and understanding that establishes purposeful physical pursuits as an integral part of their lifestyle.&lt;ref name=Almond&gt;{{cite journal|last=Almond|first=L|author2=Whitehead, M|title=Physical Literacy: Clarifying the Nature of the Concept|journal=Physical Education Matters|year=2012|volume=7|issue=1|issn=1751-0988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental and significant aspects of physical literacy&lt;ref name=Whitehead&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehead|first=M|title=Physical Literacy throughout the Lifecourse|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|isbn=0-415-48743-9|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are:

* everyone can be physically literate as it is appropriate to each individual’s endowment
* everyone’s physical literacy journey is unique
* physical literacy is relevant and valuable at all stages and ages of life
* the concept embraces much more than physical competence
* at the heart of the concept is the motivation and commitment to be active
* the disposition is evidenced by a love of being active, born out of the pleasure and satisfaction individuals experience in participation
* a physically literate individual values and takes responsibility for maintaining purposeful physical pursuits throughout the lifecourse.
* charting of progress of an individual’s personal journey must be judged against previous achievements and not against any form of national benchmarks

==General==

The concept of physical literacy has been developed over many years. It is seen, by a growing number of people, as the goal of the school subject, [[physical education]]. However, whilst this is extremely relevant, it is important to recognise that physical literacy is not restricted to the school years – it is relevant throughout the lifecourse.  In this respect, six phases of physical literacy have been identified: infancy, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, adulthood and older adulthood.&lt;ref name="Whitehead &amp; Murdoch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitehead|first=M|author2=Murdoch, E|journal=Physical Education Matters|year=2006|volume=1|issue=1|issn=1751-0988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past few years there has been considerable interest, worldwide, in the concept of physical literacy. In Great Britain, a number of local authorities have adopted it as an overall guiding principle for their work in school-based physical education. In countries such as Northern Ireland and Canada, physical literacy has been the focus for considerable rethinking in respect of children’s physical development and has consequently been the inspiration behind the development of new programmes. In [[India]] this principle has been adapted by [[Sportism]]&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; for training the [[Indian people|Indian]] kids on the basis of Physical literacy concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sportism.co.in|title=Sportism - Multi-Sports Training|website=www.sportism.co.in|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Multi-Sport Programme for Children|last=TImes|first=Adyar|date=May 22, 2016|work=|via=News Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there have been a number of interpretations of the concept that have moved away from the central tenets of physical literacy. For example, in some instances physical literacy has been the name given to a programme of fundamental movement skills, implying that the concept is solely about the acquisition of physical competence. Other interpretations have focused on knowledge and understanding, particularly in the games context. Both these scenarios include elements of physical literacy, but do not represent the whole story.&lt;ref name="Almond"/&gt;

==Attributes==

A physically literate individual will display the following attributes:&lt;ref name="Almond"/&gt;

* Physical literacy can be described as a disposition characterised by the motivation to capitalise on innate movement potential to make a significant contribution to the quality of life.
* All human beings exhibit this potential. However, its specific expression will depend   on individuals’ endowment in respect of all capabilities, significantly their movement potential, and will be particular to the culture in which they live.
* Individuals who are physically literate will move with poise, economy and confidence in a wide variety of physically challenging situations
* Physically literate individuals will be perceptive in ‘reading’ all aspects of the physical environment, anticipating movement needs or possibilities and responding appropriately to these with intelligence and imagination
* These individuals will have a well-established sense of self as embodied in the world. This, together with an articulate interaction with the environment, will engender positive self-esteem and self-confidence
* Sensitivity to and awareness of embodied capability will lead to fluent self-expression through non-verbal communication and to perceptive and empathetic interaction with others
* In addition, physically literate individuals will have the ability to identify and articulate the essential qualities that influence the effectiveness of their own movement performance, and will have an understanding of the principles of embodied health with respect to basic aspects such as exercise, sleep and nutrition

==Physical Literacy Worldwide==

===Canada===
'''Physical literacy''' is the mastering of fundamental movement skills and fundamental sport skills that permit a child to read their environment and make appropriate decisions, allowing them to move confidently and with control in a wide range of physical activity situations. It is the foundation of long-term participation and performance to the best of one’s ability. Physical Literacy is the cornerstone of both participation and excellence in physical activity and sport. Ideally, physical literacy is developed prior to the [[Adolescent development|adolescent growth spurt]].&lt;ref&gt;Physical Literacy | Canadian Sport for Life: http://www.canadiansportforlife.ca/learn-about-canadian-sport-life/physical-literacy&lt;/ref&gt;

To become physically literate children need to master the 13 fundamental movement skills:&lt;ref name="cs4l"&gt;Balyi, I., Way, R., Norris, S., Cardinal, C. &amp; Higgs, C. (2005). Canadian sport for life: Long‐term athlete development resource paper. Vancouver, BC: Canadian Sport Centres.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Locomotor and Body Skills:'''
* [[Walking]]
* [[Running]]
* [[Balance (ability)|Balance]]
* [[Ice skating|Skating]]/[[Skiing]]
* [[Jumping]]
* [[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]]
* [[Cycling]]
* [[Skipping rope|Skipping]]

'''The Sending Skills'''
* Throwing
* [[Kick (football)|Kicking]]
* Striking

'''The Receiving Skills'''
* Catching
* Trapping

Each skill will involve a series of developmental stages that the child will go through in order to master that particular skill.
Fundamental Sport Skills involve using Fundamental Movement Skills in a sport specific setting (i.e. a child can kick a ball, this is a Fundamental Movement Skill; when she kicks a penalty kick in a soccer game, she has used this skill as a Fundamental Sport Skill, the skill of kicking a penalty kick).&lt;ref name="DPL"&gt;Higgs, C., Balyi, I. &amp; Way, R. (2008). Developing physical literacy: A guide for parents of children ages 0 to 12: A supplement to Canadian sport for life. Vancouver, BC: Canadian Sport Centres.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Four Environments'''

To develop physical literacy children should learn fundamental movement skills and fundamental sport skills in each of the four basic environments:
# On the ground: as the basis for most games, sport, dance and physical activities
# In the water: as the basis for all aquatic activities
# On snow and ice: as the basis for all winter sliding activities
# In the air: basis for [[gymnastics]], [[Diving (sport)|diving]] and other aerial activities&lt;ref name="cs4l" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DPL" /&gt;

[[File:One57 under construction 3 November 2012.jpeg|thumb|A skyscraper under construction. Such a development would have gone through stringent checks against the local building code before planning permission was granted.]]
'''Planning permission''' or '''developmental approval''' refers to the approval needed for construction or expansion (including significant [[renovation]]) in some jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harwood|first1=Richard|title=Planning Permission|publisher=International Specialized Book Services|isbn=9781780434919|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=q0X0nQEACAAJ|accessdate=5 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planning permission - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/planning-permission-england-wales/when-you-need-it|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=18 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually given in the form of a '''building permit''' (or '''construction permit'''). Generally, the new construction must be [[Building inspection|inspected]] during construction and after completion to ensure compliance with national, regional, and local [[building code]]s. Planning is also dependent on the site's zone – for example, one cannot obtain permission to build a nightclub in an area where it is inappropriate such as a high-density suburb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Do I Get Planning Permission in NSW? - The Design Partnership|url=http://thedesignpartnership.com.au/planning-permission-nsw/|website=thedesignpartnership.com.au|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planning permissions and liquor licences|url=http://www.vcglr.vic.gov.au/home/liquor/new+applicants/licence+application+requirements/planning+permissions+and+liquor+licences/|website=www.vcglr.vic.gov.au|accessdate=18 February 2017|language=en-au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to obtain a permit can result in [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], [[Sanctions (law)|penalties]], and [[demolition]] of unauthorized construction if it cannot be made to meet code. House building permits, for example, are subject to [[List of housing statutes|local housing statutes]]. The criteria for planning permission are a part of [[urban planning]] and [[construction law]], and are usually managed by [[town planner]]s employed by [[local government]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Portal|first1=Planning|title=Do you need permission? {{!}} Planning Portal|url=https://www.planningportal.co.uk/info/200125/do_you_need_permission|website=www.planningportal.co.uk|accessdate=18 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Planning|first1=Department of Environment, Land, Water and|title=Planning applications|url=http://www.dtpli.vic.gov.au/planning/planning-applications|website=www.dtpli.vic.gov.au|accessdate=18 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since building permits usually precede outlays for construction, employment, financing and furnishings, they are often used as a [[economic indicator|leading indicator]] for developments in other areas of the economy.

==In specific industries==
===Broadcasting===
As part of [[broadcast law]], the term is also used in [[broadcasting]], where individual [[radio station|radio]] and [[television station]]s typically must apply for and receive permission to construct [[Radio masts and towers|radio tower]]s and [[radio antenna]]s.  This type of permit is issued by a national broadcasting authority, but does ''not'' imply [[zoning]] any other permission that must be given by [[local government]].  The permit itself also does not necessarily imply permission to operate the station once constructed. In the U.S., a construction permit is valid for three years. Afterwards, the station must receive a full license to operate, which is good for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/help?topic=cp Construction Permits] Radio-Locator.com&lt;/ref&gt;  This is provided by a separate [[broadcast license]], also called a "license to cover" by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in the United States.  Further permission or registration for [[tower]]s may be needed from [[aviation]] authorities.

In the U.S., construction permits for commercial stations are now assigned by auction, rather than the former process of determining who would serve the [[community of license]] best.  If the given [[frequency allocation]] is sought by at least one [[non-commercial educational]] (NCE) applicant, or is on an NCE-reserved TV channel or in the [[FM broadcasting|FM]] reserved band, the comparative process still takes place, though the FCC refuses to consider which [[radio format]] the applicants propose.

In Canada, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] maintains a comparative process in issuing permits, ensuring that a variety of programming is available in each area, and that as many groups as possible have access to [[free speech]] over [[radio waves]].

The Venus flytrap is a [[carnivorous plant]] that catches its prey with a trapping structure formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves, which is triggered by tiny hairs on their inner surfaces. When an insect or spider crawling along the leaves contacts a hair, the trap prepares to close, snapping shut only if a second contact occurs within approximately twenty seconds of the first strike. The requirement of redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against wasting energy by trapping objects with no nutritional value, and the plant will only begin digestion after five more stimuli to ensure it has caught a live bug worthy of consumption.

The mechanism is so highly specialized that it can distinguish between living prey and non-prey stimuli, such as falling raindrops;&lt;ref name="PRS"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Peter H.|last1=Raven|first2=Ray Franklin|last2= Evert |first3=Susan E.|last3=Eichhorn|title=Biology of Plants|edition=7th |publisher= W.H.

[[File:Cofrentes nuclear power plant cooling towers retouched.jpg|thumb|285x285px|Typical cooling towers of nuclear power plant]]
'''Power plant engineering''' or '''power station engineering''' is a division of [[power engineering]], and is defined as "the engineering and technology required for the [[Electricity generation|production]] of [[Power station|central station]] [[electric power]]."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Plant Engineering|last=Weisman|first=Joel|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|year=1985|isbn=0-13-597252-3|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey 07632|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is focused on the generation of power for industries and communities, not for household power production. The field is an interdisciplinary field, using the theoretical base of both [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[electrical engineering]]. The engineering aspect of power plant management has evolved with technology and has become progressively more complicated. The introduction of [[Nuclear power|nuclear technology]] and the progression of other existing technologies have allowed power to be created in more ways and on a larger scale than was previously possible. The assignment of different types of engineers to the design, construction, and operation of a new power plant is dependent on the type of system being built such as whether it is a [[nuclear power plant]], [[hydroelectric plant]], or solar plant.

== History ==
[[File:PearlStreetStation.jpg|thumb|Pearl Street Station 1882]]
Power plant engineering got its start in the 1800s when small systems were used by individual factories to provide [[electrical power]]. Originally the only source of power came from DC, or [[direct current]], systems.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edisontechcenter.org/HistElectPowTrans.html|title=History of Electrification Sites|last=Center|first=Copyright 2014 Edison Tech|website=www.edisontechcenter.org|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this was suitable for business, electricity was not accessible for most of the public body. During these times, the coal powered [[steam engine]] was costly to run and there was no way for the power to be transmitted over distances. [[Hydroelectricity]] was one of the most utilized forms of power generation as [[water mills]] could be used to create power to transmit to small towns.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

It wasn't until the introduction of AC, or [[alternating current]], [[AC power|power systems]] that allowed for the creation of power plants as we know them today. AC systems allowed power to be transmitted over larger distances than DC systems allowed and thus, large power stations were able to be created. One of the progenitors of long-distance power-transmission was the [[International Electrotechnical Exhibition|Lauffen to Frankfurt power plant]] which spanned 109 miles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edisontechcenter.org/LauffenFrankfurt.html|title=Lauffen to Frankfurt 1891|last=Center|first=Copyright 2015 Edison Tech|website=www.edisontechcenter.org|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lauffen-Frankfurt demonstrated how [[three-phase power]] could be effectively applied to transmit power over long distances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brighthubengineering.com/power-plants/18686-what-are-power-plants/|title=What are Power Plants?|website=Brighthub Engineering|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three-phase power had been the progeny of years of research in power distribution and the Lauffen-Frankfurt was the first exhibition to show its real potential for future use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The engineering knowledge needed to perform these tasks enlists the help of several fields of engineering including mechanical, electrical, [[nuclear engineering|nuclear]] and [[civil engineering|civil engineers]]. When power plants were up and coming, engineering tasks needed to create these facilities mainly consisted of mechanical, civil, and electrical engineers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These disciplines allowed for the planning and construction of power plants. But when nuclear power plants were created it introduced nuclear engineers to perform the calculations necessary to maintain safety standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/47749-nuclear-engineering.html|title=What Is Nuclear Engineering?|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governing principles ==

=== First Law of Thermodynamics ===
In simple terms, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] states that [[energy]] cannot be created nor destroyed; however, power can be converted from one form of energy to another form of energy. This is especially important in power generation because power production in nearly all types of power plants relies upon the use of a [[Electric generator|generator]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Generators are used to convert [[mechanical energy]] into electrical energy; for example, [[wind turbines]] utilize a large blade connected to a shaft which turns the generator when rotated. The generator then creates electricity due to the interaction of a conductor within a magnetic field. In this case, the mechanical energy generated by the wind is converted, through the generator, into electric energy. Most power plants rely on these conversions to create usable electric power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/electricity3.htm|title=How Electricity Works|date=2004-05-28|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second law of thermodynamics ===
The [[second law of thermodynamics]] conceptualizes that the [[entropy]] of a closed system can never decrease. As the law relates to power plants, it dictates that heat is to flow from a body at high temperature to a body at low temperature (the device in which electricity is being generated).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This law is particularly pertinent to [[thermal power plants]] which derive their energy from the [[combustion]] of a [[fuel]] source.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Types of power plants ==
All power plants are created with the same goal: to produce electric power as efficiently as possible. However, as technology has evolved, the sources of energy used in power plants has evolved as well.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The introduction of more renewable/sustainable forms of energy has caused an increase in the improvement and creation of certain power plants.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Hydroelectric power plants ===
[[File:Diablo Dam (from WA SR 20).jpg|thumb|239x239px|Hydroelectric Dam]]
[[Hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric power plants]] generate power using the force of water to turn generators. They can be categorized into three different types; impoundment, diversion and pumped storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/types-hydropower-plants|title=Types of Hydropower Plants {{!}} Department of Energy|website=www.energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impoundment and diversion hydroelectric power plants operate similarly in that each involves creating a barrier to keep water from flowing at an uncontrollable rate, and then controlling the flow rate of water to pass through turbines to create electricity at an ideal level. Mechanical engineers are in charge of calculating flow rates and other volumetric calculations necessary to turn the generators at the electrical engineers specifications. Pumped storage hydroelectric power plants operate in a similar manner but only function at peak hours of power demand. At calm hours the water is pumped uphill, then is released at peak hours to flow from a high to low elevation to turn turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/hyhowworks.html|title=Hydroelectric Power: How it works, USGS Water-Science School|last=USGS|first=Howard Perlman,|website=water.usgs.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engineering knowledge required to assess the performance of pumped storage hydroelectric power plants is very similar to that of the impoundment and diversion power plants.

=== Thermal power plants ===
[[File:Komatsu bulldozer pushing coal in Power plant Ljubljana (winter 2017).jpg|thumb|238x238px|Coal being pushed into coal power plant]]
[[Thermal power station|Thermal power plants]] are split into two different categories; those that create electricity by burning fuel and those that create electricity via prime mover. A common example of a thermal power plant that produces electricity by the consumption of fuel is the nuclear power plant. Nuclear power plants use a [[nuclear reactor|nuclear reactor's]] heat to turn water into steam.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This steam is sent through a turbine which is connected to an electric generator to generate electricity. [[Nuclear power plant]]s account for 20% of [[Energy in the United States|America's electricity generation]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thermal-powerplant.blogspot.com/2010/05/thermal-power-plant-classification.html|title=Thermal Power Plant Classification|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a fuel burning power plant is [[Fossil fuel power station|coal power plant]]. [[Fossil fuel power station|Coal power plants]] generate 50% of the United States' electricity supply.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Coal power plants operate in a manner similar to nuclear power plants in that the heat from the burning coal powers a steam turbine and electric generator.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; There are several types of engineers that work in a Thermal Power Plant. Mechanical engineers maintain performance of the thermal power plants while keeping the plants in operation.&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://work.chron.com/engineers-work-solar-1835.html|title=Engineers Who Work With Solar|last=Wagner|first=Vivian|date=|website=Houston Chronicle|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear Engineer generally handle fuel efficiency and disposal of nuclear waste; however, in Nuclear Power Plants they work directly with nuclear equipment.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collegegrad.com/careers/nuclear-engineers|title=Nuclear Engineers|last=|first=|date=|website=CollegeGrad|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical Engineers deals with the power generating equipment as well as the calculations.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sokanu.com/careers/electrical-engineer/#what-does-an-electrical-engineer-do|title=What Does An Electrical Engineer Do?|last=|first=|date=|website=Sokanu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar power plants ===
[[File:Fixed Tilt Solar panel at Canterbury Municipal Building Canterbury New Hampshire.jpg|thumb|237x237px|Solar field]]
[[Solar power plant]]s derive their energy from sunlight, which is made accessible via [[photovoltaics]] (PV's). Photovoltaic panels, or [[solar panels]], are constructed using photovoltaic cells which are made of [[semiconductor]] materials that release electrons when they are warmed by the thermal energy of the sun.

=== Wind power plants ===

Wind power plants can be implemented on large, open expanses of land or on large bodies of water such as the oceans; they simply rely on being in areas that experience significant amounts of wind.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Technically, wind turbines are a form of solar power in that they rely on pressure differentials caused by uneven heating of the earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Wind turbines solicit the knowledge from mechanical, electrical, and civil engineers.

== Education ==
Power plant engineering covers a broad spectrum of engineering disciplines. The field can solicit information from mechanical, electrical, nuclear, and civil engineers.

=== Mechanical ===
[[Mechanical engineering|Mechanical engineers]] work to maintain and control machinery that used to power the plant.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; To work in this field, mechanical engineers require a bachelor's degree in Engineering and licenses passing both the Professional Engineering Exam (PE) and Fundamental Engineering Exam (FE).The Mechanical Engineers have additional roles that are needed to be considered based on their career. In thermal power plants work in its optimal capacity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; When working in thermal power plants, mechanical engineers make sure heavy machinery like boilers and turbines, are working in optimal condition and power is continually generated.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Mechanical engineers also work with the operations of the plant. In nuclear and hydraulic power plants the engineers work to make sure that heavy machinery is maintained and preventative maintenance is performed.

=== Electrical ===
[[Electrical engineering|Electrical engineers]] work with electrical appliances while making sure electronic instruments and appliances are working in company and state level satisfaction.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They require licenses passing both the Professional Engineering Exam (PE) and Fundamental Engineering Exam (FE).  It is also preferred that they have a bachelor's degree approved by the [[ABET|Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology, Inc.]] (ABET) and field experience before getting an entry level position.

=== Nuclear ===
[[Nuclear engineering|Nuclear engineers]] develops and research methods, machinery and systems concerning radiation and energy in subatomic levels.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; They require on-site experience and a bachelor's degree in Engineering. These engineers work in Nuclear Power plants and require licenses for practice while working in the power plant. They require work experience, passing the Professional Engineering Exam(PE), Fundamental Engineering Exam (FE), and a degree from an [[ABET|Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc]] (ABET) approved school.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Nuclear engineers work with the handling of nuclear material and operations of a nuclear power plant. These operations can range from handling of nuclear wastes, nuclear material experiments, and design of nuclear equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/nuclear-engineers.htm#tab-2|title=What Nuclear Engineers Do|last=|first=|date=April 13, 2018|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Associations ===
While there are many disparities between the aforementioned engineering disciplines, they all cover material related to [[heat transfer|heat]] or electricity transmission. Obtaining a degree from an [[ABET]] accredited school in any one of these disciplines is essential to becoming a power plant engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/articles/How_to_Become_a_Power_Plant_Operator_Career_Guide.html|title=How to Become a Power Plant Operator: Career Guide|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many associations which qualified engineers can join, including the [[ASME|American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME), the [[IEEE|Institute of Electric and Electronic Engineers]] (IEEE), and the [http://www.asope.org/ American Society of Power Engineers] (ASOPE).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8902">The '''Pressure Flow Hypothesis''', also known as the '''Mass Flow Hypothesis''', is the best-supported theory to explain the movement of [[sap]] through the [[phloem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biology-pages.info/P/Phloem.html Translocation of Food]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Advanced Biology: A new mainstream text for the new specifications |author= Michael Kent |edition= illustrated |publisher= OUP Oxford |year= 2000 |isbn= 9780199141951 |page= 286}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed by [[Ernst Munch]], a [[Germany|German]] [[plant physiology|plant physiologist]] in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A high concentration of organic substances, particularly [[sugar]], inside [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s of the phloem at a source, such as a [[leaf]], creates a [[diffusion|diffusion gradient]] (osmotic gradient) that draws water into the cells from the adjacent [[xylem]]. This creates [[turgor]] pressure, also known as [[hydrostatic pressure]], in the phloem. Movement of phloem sap occurs by bulk flow (mass flow) from ''sugar sources'' to ''sugar sinks''. The movement in phloem is bidirectional, whereas, in [[xylem]] cells, it is unidirectional (upward). Because of this multi-directional flow, coupled with the fact that sap cannot move with ease between adjacent sieve-tubes, it is not unusual for sap in adjacent sieve-tubes to be flowing in opposite directions.

==Sources and sinks==
A sugar source is any part of the plant that is producing or releasing sugar.

During the plant's growth period, usually during the spring, storage organs such as the [[root]]s are sugar sources, and the plant's many growing areas are sugar sinks.

After the growth period, when the [[meristem]]s are dormant, the [[leaf|leaves]] are sources, and storage organs are sinks. Developing [[seed]]-bearing organs (such as [[fruit]]) are always sinks.

==Mechanisms==
While movement of water and minerals through the xylem is driven by negative pressures (tension) most of the time, movement through the phloem is driven by positive hydrostatic pressure. This process is termed ''translocation'', and is accomplished by a process called ''phloem loading'' and ''unloading''. Cells in a sugar source "load" a sieve-tube element by [[active transport|actively transporting]] solute molecules into it. This causes water to move into the sieve-tube element by [[osmosis]], creating pressure that pushes the sap down the tube. In sugar sinks, cells actively transport solutes ''out'' of the sieve-tube elements, producing the exactly opposite effect. The gradient of sugar from source to sink causes pressure flow through the sieve tube toward the sink.

'''The mechanisms are as follows:'''

*Glucose is produced by [[photosynthesis]] in the [[mesophyll]] cells of green leaves. Some glucose is used within the cells during respiration. The rest of the glucose is converted into non-reducing sugar i.e. [[sucrose]]. It has been shown that the sucrose concentration in sieve tubes in leaves is commonly between 10 and 30 percent whereas it forms only 0.5% solution in the photosynthesis cells.
*The sucrose is actively transported to the [[companion cell]]s of the smallest veins in the leaves.
*The sucrose diffuses through the [[plasmodesmata]] from the companion cells to the [[sieve tube element]]s. As a result, concentration of sucrose increases in the sieve tube elements.
*Water moves by osmosis from the nearby xylem in the same leaf vein. This increases the hydrostatic pressure of the sieve tube elements.
*Hydrostatic pressure moves the sucrose and other substances through the sieve tube cells, towards a sink.
*In the storage sinks, such as sugar beet root and sugar cane stem, sucrose is removed into [[apoplast]] prior to entering the [[symplast]] of the sink.
*Water moves out of the sieve tube cells by osmosis, lowering the hydrostatic pressure within them. Thus the pressure gradient is established as a consequence of entry of sugars in sieve elements at the source and removal of sucrose at the sink. The presence of sieve plates greatly increases the resistance along the pathway and results in the generation and maintenance of substantial pressure gradients in the sieve elements between source and sink.
* The phloem sugar is removed by the cortex of both stem and root, and is consumed by [[cellular respiration]] or else converted into starch. Starch is insoluble and exerts no osmotic effect. Consequently, the osmotic pressure of the contents of phloem decreases. Finally relatively pure water is left in the phloem and this is thought to leave by osmosis or be drawn back into nearby xylem vessels by suction of the transpiration pull.

The pressure flow mechanism depends upon:
* Turgor pressure
* Difference of osmotic pressure gradient along the direction of flow between the source and the sink.

==Evidence==
There are different pieces of evidences that support the hypothesis. Firstly, there is an exudation of solution from the phloem when the stem is cut or punctured by the mouthparts of an aphid, a classical experiment demonstrating the translocation function of phloem, indicating that the phloem sap is under pressure. Secondly, concentration gradients of organic solutes are proved to be present between the sink and the source. Thirdly, when viruses or growth chemicals are applied to a well-illuminated (actively photosynthesising) leaf, they are translocated downwards to the roots. Yet, when applied to shaded leaves, such downward translocation of chemicals does not occur, hence showing that diffusion is not a possible process involved in translocation.

==Criticisms==
Opposition or criticisms against the hypothesis are often voiced. Some argue that mass flow is a passive process while sieve tube vessels are supported by companion cells. Hence, the hypothesis neglects the living nature of phloem. Moreover, it is found that amino acids and sugars (examples of organic solutes) are translocated at different rates, which is contrary to the assumption in the hypothesis that all materials being transported would travel at uniform speed. Bi-directional movements of solutes in translocation process as well as the fact that translocation is heavily affected by changes in environmental conditions like temperature and metabolic inhibitors are two defects of the hypothesis.

An objection leveled against the pressure flow mechanism is that it does not explain the phenomenon of bidirectional movement i.e. movement of different substances in opponent directions at the same time. The phenomenon of bidirectional movement can be demonstrated by applying two different substances at the same time to the phloem of a stem at two different points, and following their longitudinal movement along the stem. If the mechanism of translocation operates according to pressure flow hypothesis, bidirectional movement in a single sieve tube is not possible. Experiments to demonstrate bidirectional movement in a single sieve tube are technically very difficult to perform. Some experiments indicate that bidirectional movement may occur in a single sieve tube, whereas others do not.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Other theories==
Some plants appear not to load phloem by active transport. In these cases a mechanism known as the [[polymer trap mechanism]] was proposed by [[Robert Turgeon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference
|author=Turgeon, R 
|year=1991 
|title=Symplastic phloem loading and the sink-source transition in leaves: a model
|booktitle=Recent Advances Phloem Transport and Assimilate Compartmentation
|editor1=VL Bonnemain |editor2=S Delrot |editor3=J Dainty |editor4=WJ Lucas }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case small sugars such as sucrose move into intermediary cells through narrow plasmodesmata, where they are polymerised to [[raffinose]] and other larger [[oligosaccharides]]. Now they are unable to move back, but can proceed through wider plasmodesmata into the sieve tube element.

The symplastic phloem loading is confined mostly to plants in tropical rain forests and is seen as more primitive. The actively transported apoplastic phloem loading is viewed as more advanced, as it is found in the later-evolved plants, and particularly in those in temperate and arid conditions.  This mechanism may therefore have allowed plants to colonise the cooler locations.

Organic [[molecule]]s such as sugars, [[amino acid]]s, certain [[hormone]]s, and even [[messenger RNA]]s are transported in the phloem through [[sieve tube element]]s.

'''Radio occultation''' (RO) is a [[remote sensing]] technique used for measuring the physical properties of a planetary [[atmosphere]] or [[Ring system (astronomy)|ring system]].

==Atmospheric radio occultation==
Atmospheric radio occultation relies on the detection of a change in a radio signal as it passes through a planet's atmosphere, i.e. as it is [[occulted]] by the atmosphere. When [[electromagnetic radiation]] (light) passes through the atmosphere, it is refracted (or bent). The magnitude of the [[refraction]] depends on the gradient of refractivity normal to the path, which in turn depends on the density gradient. The effect is most pronounced when the radiation traverses a long atmospheric limb path. At radio frequencies the amount of bending cannot be measured directly; instead the bending can be calculated using the [[Doppler shift]] of the signal given the geometry of the emitter and receiver. The amount of bending can be related to the refractive index by using an [[Abel transform]] on the formula relating bending angle to refractivity. In the case of the neutral atmosphere (below the ionosphere) information on the atmosphere's [[temperature]], [[pressure]] and water vapour content can be derived giving radio occultation data applications in [[meteorology]].

==GNSS radio occultation==
'''GNSS''' or '''GPS radio occultation''' (GNSS-RO, GPS-RO, GPSRO) is a type of radio occultation that relies on radio transmissions from GPS ([[Global Positioning System]]), or more generally from GNSS ([[Global Navigation Satellite System]]), satellites.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne et al. 1994.  ''The application of spacebourne GPS to atmospheric limb sounding and global change monitoring.''  Publication 94-18, Jet Propulsion Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kursinski et al. 1997.  ''Observing the Earth's atmosphere with radio occultation measurements using the Global Positioning System.''  J. Geophys. Res. '''102:'''23.429-23.465.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a relatively new technique (first applied in 1995) for performing atmospheric measurements. It is used as a [[weather forecasting]] tool, and could also be harnessed in monitoring [[climate change]]. The technique involves a [[low-Earth orbit]] satellite receiving a signal from a [[GPS]] satellite. The signal has to pass through the atmosphere and gets [[refracted]] along the way. The magnitude of the refraction depends on the temperature and water vapor concentration in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="GPS Thermometer"&gt;{{cite web|title=GPS 'thermometer' could flag up climate change|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/tech/dn13329-gps-thermometer-could-flag-up-climate-change.html|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GPS Radio occultation amounts to an almost instantaneous depiction of the atmospheric state. The relative position between the [[GPS]] satellite and the [[low-Earth orbit]] satellite changes over time, allowing for a vertical scanning of successive layers of the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="GPS Space-Based &amp; Radio occultation"&gt;{{cite web|title=GPS Space-Based &amp; GPS Radio occultation|url=http://geodaf.mt.asi.it/html_old/GPSAtmo/space.html|accessdate=2008-02-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515121521/http://geodaf.mt.asi.it/html_old/GPSAtmo/space.html|archivedate=2009-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26974">'''Religion and environmentalism''' is an emerging interdisciplinary subfield in the academic disciplines of [[religious studies]], [[religious ethics]], the [[sociology of religion]], and [[theology]] amongst others, with [[environmentalism]] and [[ecology|ecological]] principles as a primary focus.

==General overview==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}

===Crisis of values===
This subfield is founded on the understanding that, in the words of Iranian-American [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], "the environmental crisis is fundamentally a crisis of [[value (personal and cultural)|values]]," and that [[religion]]s, being a primary source of values in any [[culture]], are thus implicated in the decisions humans make regarding the [[Natural environment|environment]].

===Burden of guilt===
[[History|Historian]] [[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.|Lynn White, Jr.]] first made the argument in a 1966 lecture before the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], subsequently published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', that [[Western Christianity]], having de-[[sacralized]] and instrumentalized [[nature]] to human ends, bears a substantial "burden of guilt" for the contemporary environmental crisis. White's essay stimulated a flurry of responses, ranging from defenses of [[Christianity]] to qualified admissions to complete agreement with his analysis.

===Eastern religions and indigenous peoples===
Some proposed that [[Eastern religions]], as well as those of [[indigenous peoples]], [[Neopaganism|neo-pagans]], and others, offered more [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] [[World view|worldviews]] than Christianity.  A third, more obscure camp, argued that while White's theory was  indeed correct, this was actually a benefit to society, and that thinning the populations of weaker plant and animal species via environmental destruction would lead to the [[evolution]] of stronger, more productive creatures.  See [[Kaitiaki]] in [[Māori religion]].

===Religion and ecology===
By the 1990s, many scholars of religion had entered the debate and begun to generate a substantial body of literature discussing and analyzing how nature is valued in the world's various religious systems. A landmark event was a series of ten conferences on Religion and Ecology organized by [[Yale University]] professors Mary Evelyn Tucker and John Grim and held at the [[Harvard University]] Center for the Study of World Religions from 1996 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ecology and Religion|last = Tucker|first = Mary Evelyn|publisher = Island Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-59726-707-6|location = Washington|pages = 6|last2 = Grim|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fore.yale.edu/religions-of-the-world-and-ecology-archive-of-conference-materials/|title=Religions of the World and Ecology: Archive Of Conference Materials|last=|first=|date=|website=Forum on Religion and Ecology at Yale|access-date=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 800 international scholars, religious leaders, and environmentalists participated in the conference series. The conferences concluded at the United Nations and at the American Museum of Natural History with more than 1,000 people in attendance. Papers from the conferences were published in a series of ten books (The Religions of the World and Ecology Book Series), one for each of the world's major religious traditions.

From these conferences, Tucker and Grim would form The Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fore.yale.edu/|title=The Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forum has been instrumental in the creation of scholarship, in forming environmental policy, and in the greening of religion. In addition to their work with the Forum, Tucker and Grim's work continues in the ''Journey of the Universe'' film, book, and educational DVD series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journeyoftheuniverse.org/|title=Welcome - Journey Of The Universe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be the largest international multireligious project of its kind.

An active Religion and Ecology group has been in existence within the [[American Academy of Religion]] since 1991, and an increasing number of universities in [[North America]] and around the world are now offering courses on religion and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;“Religion and Ecology Group.” American Academy of Religion. https://papers.aarweb.org/content/religion-and-ecology-group Accessed July 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship on the field of religion and ecology can be found in the peer-reviewed academic journal ''Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology'' and in reference works such as the encyclopedia ''The Spirit of Sustainability''.

===Religion and nature===
Other landmarks in the emerging field was the publication of the ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature'' in 2005, which was edited by [[Bron Taylor]].  Taylor also led the effort to form the International Society for the Study of Religion, Nature and Culture, which was established in 2006, and began publishing the quarterly ''Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature, and Culture'' in 2007.

==Religions and the environment==
===Buddhism===
The best asset religion offers is the moral framework by which practitioners must abide.&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"&gt;Eco-Dharma Center. (N.d.) Buddhism and Ecology. Catalan Pyrenees: Nick Day. Retrieved February 18, 2010, from http://www.ecodharma.com/influences-articles/buddhism-ecology.&lt;/ref&gt; Since many environmental problems have stemmed from human activity, it follows that religion might hold some solutions to mitigating destructive patterns. [[Buddhism]] idealizes and emphasizes interconnection,&lt;ref name="Tucker, M.E. 1998"&gt;Tucker, M.E. &amp; Williams, D.R. (Eds.). (1998). Buddhism and Ecology: The Interconnection of Dharma and Deeds. Cambridge: [[Harvard University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; thereby creating a mindset that creates a productive and cooperative relationship between humans and nature. That all actions are based on the premise of interconnection makes the Buddhist mindset effective in cultivating modesty, compassion, and balance among followers, which may ultimately mitigate the harm done to the environment.

One benefit of the Buddhist interconnected mindset is the inevitable humility that ensues. Because humans are entwined with natural systems, damage done upon the [[Earth]] is also harm done to humans.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"&gt;Badiner, A.H. (1990). Dharma Gaia. United States of America: Parallax Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This realization is quite modifying to a human race that historically pillages the Earth for individual benefit. When rational humans minimize the split between humanity and nature and bridge the gaps,&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"/&gt; only then will a mutual respect emerge in which all entities coexist rather than fight. Buddhism maintains that the reason for all suffering comes from attachment.&lt;ref&gt;Knierim, T. (Last modified 2009). Four Noble Truths. Big View. Retrieved February 24, 2010, from {{cite web |url=http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111202249/http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |archivedate=2009-11-11 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt; When release from the tight grasp humanity has on individuality and separateness occurs, then oneness and interconnection is realized. So rather than emphasizing winners and losers, humanity will understand its existence within others; this results in a modesty that ends egoic mind.

Another benefit of Buddhist practice to the environment is the compassion that drives all thinking.&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"/&gt; When humans realize that they are all connected, harm done to another will never benefit the initiator.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; Therefore, peaceful wishes for everyone and everything will ultimately benefit the initiator. Through accepting that the web of life is connected&lt;ref name="Tucker, M.E. 1998"/&gt;—if one entity benefits, all benefit&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt;—then the prevailing mindset encourages peaceful actions all the time. If everything depends on everything else, then only beneficial events will make life situations better. Acceptance of compassion takes training and practice, which is also encouraged by Buddhist moral conduct in the form of mediation. This habitual striving for harmony and friendship among all beings creates a more perfect relationship between humanity and nature.

Lastly, Buddhist mindset relies on taking the middle road or striving for balance. [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the founder of Buddhism, spent his life searching for the outlet of human suffering, eventually concluding that a balance must be established between self-destruction and self-indulgence.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J. (Producer) &amp; Bertolucci, B (Director). (1994). [[Little Buddha]]. United States of America: Buena Vista Home Entertainment.&lt;/ref&gt; While modern, industrial humans emphasize economic and social aspects of life and lastly environmental aspects, this view is lopsided.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; When human preferences are leveled with environmental preferences—giving a voice to natural systems as well as human systems—then can balance and harmony be realized.

Therefore, using this idealized and disciplined framework that Buddhism has to offer can create lasting solutions to amending the broken relationship between humanity and nature. What ensues is an ethic, rather than a short-term policy or technological fix.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; When never-ending consumption patterns cease for the betterment of the world as a whole, then all systems will harmoniously interact in a non-abusive way.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; Without needing to adopt a new religion, just recognizing and accepting this mindset can help to heal the environmental injuries of the past.

Buddhists today are involved in spreading environmental awareness. In a meeting with the U.S Ambassador to the Republic of India [[Timothy J. Roemer]], the [[Dalai Lama]] urged the U.S to engage China on climate change in [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian Newspaper from http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/220120&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama has also been part of a series on discussions organised by the [[Mind and Life Institute]]; a non profit organisation that specializes on the relationship between [[science]] and Buddhism. The talks were partly about ecology, ethics and interdependence and issues on global warming were brought up &lt;ref&gt;[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/on-climate-ethics-cow-burps-and-the-dalai-lama/ On Climate, Ethics, Cow Burps and the Dalai Lama] October 21, 2011 NYT&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{main|Christian views on environmentalism}}

[[Christianity]] has a historic concern for nature and the natural world. At the same time, ecological concerns operate in tension with [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] values, such as the [[Biblical]] notion of human dominion over the Earth. ([[Book of Genesis|Gen]] 1:28) A broad range of Christian institutions are engaged in the [[environmental movement]] and contemporary environmental concerns.

====Latter Day Saint movement====
[[Mormon]] environmentalists find theological reasons for stewardship and conservationism through biblical and additional scriptural references including a passages from the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]: "And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this end were they made to be used, with judgment, not to excess, neither by extortion" ([[Doctrine and Covenants|D&amp;C]] 59:20).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.20?lang=eng|title=Doctrine and Covenants 59:20|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latter Day Saint movement]] has a complex relationship with environmental concerns, involving not only the religion but politics and economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Mormon-Belief-and-the-Environment.html "Mormon Belief and the Environment"], by [[George B. Handley]] in [[Patheos]] September 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1998) ''New Genesis: A Mormon Reader on Land and Community'' Editors: [[Terry Tempest Williams]], Gibbs M. Smith, William B. Smart {{ISBN|978-0-87905-843-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[environmentally friendly]] policies, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has a history of utilizing elements of conservationist policies for their [[Meeting house|meetinghouses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/ConservationPractices/|title=Timeline of Construction Practices|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church first placed [[solar panels]] on a church meetinghouse in the [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu Islands]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700027829/Mormon-Church-unveils-solar-powered-meetinghouse.html|title=Mormon Church unveils solar powered meetinghouse|first=Scott|last=Taylor|date=28 April 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the church unveiled five [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certified meetinghouse prototypes that are that will be used as future meetinghouse designs around the world, the first one having been completed in 2010 in [[Farmington, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_14968222|title=Utah Local News - Salt Lake City News, Sports, Archive - The Salt Lake Tribune|first=The Salt Lake|last=Tribune|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104095531/http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_14968222|archivedate=2012-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
In [[Hinduism]], practitioners and scholars find traditional approaches to the natural environment in such concepts as [[dharmic]] ethics or [[prakrti]] (material creation), the development of [[ayurveda]], and readings of [[vedas|vedic literature]]. Hindu [[environmental activism]] also may be inspired by [[Gandhian philosophy]] and practical struggles, such as the [[Bishnoi]] community in Rajasthan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =Jain, Pankaj|title=Dharma and Ecology of Hindu Communities: Sustenance and Sustainability|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chipko]] resistance to [[forestry]] policies in [[Uttar Pradesh]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Chappl and Tucker|title=Hinduism and Ecology: The intersection of earth, sky and water|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahatma Gandhi played a major role in Indian environmentalism, and has been called the "father of Indian environmentalism".&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi's environmental thought parallels his social thoughts in that environmental sustainability and social inequalities should be managed in similar fashions.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; His non-violent teachings left a lasting impact, even agriculturally. Contemporary agrarian practices use the Bhagavad-Gita to establish practices that are deemed non-violent.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{See also|Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Science}}
Through the tradition from the [[Quran]] and the prophets, the environment was made sacred. It is believed that God did not create the environment for a random reason, but rather a reflection of truth. One can gain profound knowledge from nature thus, human beings are to preserve it and look after it.  Many chapters in the  Quran, refer to the beauties of nature as well as the headings of many chapters indicating the importance of it, such as: "The Sun", "Dawn", and "Morning Hours". Thus man is God's representative on this planet, if he is not charged with sustaining it, then at least he must not destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Holy Quran and the Environment| year=2010| chapter=The Relationship between The Environment and Man| chapterurl=http://www.rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129013542/http://rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html| archivedate=2010-11-29| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], the concept of a [[Hima (environmental protection)|hima]] or "inviolate zone" refers to a piece of land that has been set aside to prevent cultivation or any use other than [[Spirituality|spiritual]] purposes.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Judaism and environmentalism}}

In [[Judaism]], the natural world plays a central role in [[Jewish law]], literature, and liturgical and other practices. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Within the diverse arena of Jewish thought, beliefs vary widely about the human relation to the environment, though the rabbinic tradition has put Judaism primarily on an [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] trajectory. However, a few contemporary Jewish thinkers and rabbis in the USA and [[Israel]] emphasized that a central belief in Judaism is that the Man (Ha Adam - האדם whose root comes from Haadama (earth) - האדמה, in [[Hebrew language]]), should keep the Earth in the same state as he received it from God, its eternal and actual "owner" (especially for the land of [[Israel]]), thus the people today should avoid polluting it and keep it clean for the future generations. According to this opinion, Judaism is clearly in line with the principles of environmental protection and [[sustainable development]].

In Jewish law (''halakhah''), ecological concerns are reflected in Biblical protection for fruit trees, rules in the [[Mishnah]] against harming the public domain, [[Talmud]]ic debate over noise and smoke [[Nezikin|damages]], and contemporary [[responsa]] on agricultural pollution. In [[Conservative Judaism]], there has been some attempt to adopt [[ecokashrut]] ideas{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} developed in the 1970s by Rabbi [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]]. In addition, Jewish activists have recruited principles of ''halakhah'' for environmental purposes, such as the injunction against unnecessary destruction, known as [[bal tashkhit]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In contemporary Jewish liturgy, ecological concerns have been promoted by adapting a [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] [[ritual]] for the holiday of trees, [[Tu Bishvat]]. Biblical and rabbinic texts have been enlisted for prayers about the environment, especially in [[Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Jewish Renewal]] movements.

In the U.S., a diverse coalition of Jewish environmentalists undertakes both educational and policy advocacy on such issues as [[biodiversity]] and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|title=About COEJL|publisher=Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life, New York|url=http://www.coejl.org/~coejlor/about/|accessdate=2008-01-08}} and the [http://jewcology.org/map-of-initiatives/ Jewcology map of Jewish environmental initiatives].&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish environmentalists are drawn from all branches of religious life, ranging from Rabbi [[Arthur Waskow]] to the Orthodox group Canfei Nesharim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease|url=http://canfeinesharim.org/who_we_are/in_news.php?page=13141|title=Canfei Nesharim Named One of North America’s Most Innovative Jewish Nonprofits|publisher=Canfei Nesharim|date=2007-10-08|accessdate=2008-01-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108231605/http://canfeinesharim.org/who_we_are/in_news.php?page=13141|archivedate=2007-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jews]] have formed numerous governmental and [[non-governmental organizations]] to protect nature and reduce pollution. While many Israeli environmental organizations make limited use of Jewish religious teachings, a few do approach Israel's environmental problems from a Jewish standpoint, including [http://www.earthday.org/partner/heschel-center-environmental-learning-and-leadership the Heschel Center for Environmental Learning and Leadership], named after [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]].

===Taoism===
[[Taoism]] offers many ideas that are in line with environmentalism, such as [[wu wei]], [[moderation]], [[compassion]] and Taoist [[animism]]. Parallels were found between Taoism and [[deep ecology]]. Pioneer of environmentalism [[John Muir]] was called "the Taoist of the West". Rosenfeld wrote 'Taoism is environmentalism'.&lt;ref name="Zai 2015"&gt;Dr Zai, J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-WzMCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover1 ''Taoism and Science: Cosmology, Evolution, Morality, Health and more''].

Baird Earth's Insights: A Multicultural Survey of Ecological Ethics from the Mediterranean Basin to the Australian Outback Callicott&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], the ancient and perhaps timeless philosophical concepts, like ''Parasparopagraho Jivanam'', were more recently compiled into a [http://www.jainology.org/publications/jain-delaration-on-nature Jain Declaration on Nature], which describes the religion's inherent [[Biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]] and deep ecology. ({{cite encyclopedia |title=Parasparopagraho Jivanam|encyclopedia=Wikipedia|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasparopagraho_Jivanam}})

A '''sacrificial part''' is a part of a machine or product that is intentionally engineered to fail under excess [[mechanical stress]], [[Electric current|electrical stress]], or other unexpected and dangerous situations. The sacrificial part is engineered to fail first, and thus protect other parts of the system.

Examples of sacrificial parts include:
* [[Fuse (electrical)|Electrical fuses]]
* [[Burst disk|Over-pressure burst disks]]
* [[Shear pin|Mechanical shear pins]]
* [[Galvanic anode]]s

Key:

W = Body weight in kilograms

SEE = Standard error of estimation

The raw figure obtained by the equation should be adjusted up or downwards, within the confidence limit suggested by the quoted estimation errors, and according to the following principles:

Subjects leaner and more muscular than usual require more energy than the average.
Obese subjects require less.
Patients at the young end of the age range for a given equation require more energy.
Patients at the high end of the age range for a given equation require less energy.

Effects of age and body mass may cancel out: an obese 30-year-old or an athletic 60-year-old may need no adjustment from the raw figure.

To find actual energy needed per day (Estimated Energy Requirement), the base metabolism must then be multiplied by an activity factor. 
These are as follows:

*Sedentary people of both genders should multiply by 1.3. Sedentary is very physically inactive, inactive in both work and leisure.
*Lightly active men should multiply by 1.6 and women by 1.5. Lightly active means the daily routine includes some walking, or intense exercise once or twice per week. Most students are in this category.
*Moderately active men should multiply by 1.7 and women by 1.6. Moderately active means intense exercise lasting 20–45 minutes at least three time per week, or a job with a lot of walking, or a moderate intensity job.
*Very Active men should multiply by 2.1 and women by 1.9. Very active means intense exercise lasting at least an hour per day, or a heavy physical job, such as a mail carrier or an athlete in training.
*Extremely active men should multiply by 2.4 and women by 2.2. Extremely active means an athlete on an unstoppable training schedule or a very demanding job, such as working in the armed forces or shoveling coal.

These equations were published in 1989 in the dietary guidelines and formed the RDA's for a number of years. The activity factor used by the USDA was 1.6. In the UK, a lower activity factor  of 1.4 is used. The equation has now been replaced by the [[Institute of Medicine Equation]] in  September 2002 in the USA, however is still currently used by the FAO/WHO/UNU.

[[Star]]s of different mass and age have varying '''internal structures'''. Stellar structure models describe the internal structure of a star in detail and make detailed predictions about the [[luminosity]], the [[stellar classification|color]] and the [[stellar evolution|future evolution]] of the star.

==Energy transport==
[[File:Heat Transfer in Stars.png|350px|thumb|The different transport mechanisms of low-mass, intermediate-mass, and high-mass stars.]]

Different layers of the stars transport heat up and outwards in different ways, primarily [[convection]] and [[radiative transfer]], but [[heat conduction|thermal conduction]] is important in [[white dwarf]]s.

Convection is the dominant mode of energy transport when the temperature gradient is steep enough so that a given parcel of gas within the star will continue to rise if it rises slightly via an [[adiabatic process]]. In this case, the rising parcel is [[buoyant]] and continues to rise if it is warmer than the surrounding gas; if the rising particle is cooler than the surrounding gas, it will fall back to its original height.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hansen|Kawaler|Trimble|2004|loc=§5.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regions with a low temperature gradient and a low enough [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] to allow energy transport via radiation, radiation is the dominant mode of energy transport.

The internal structure of a [[main sequence]] star depends upon the mass of the star.

In stars with masses of 0.3–1.5 [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=yes}}), including the [[Sun]], hydrogen-to-helium fusion occurs primarily via [[proton-proton chain]]s, which do not establish a steep temperature gradient. Thus, radiation dominates in the inner portion of solar mass stars. The outer portion of solar mass stars is cool enough that hydrogen is neutral and thus opaque to ultraviolet photons, so convection dominates. Therefore, solar mass stars have radiative cores with convective envelopes in the outer portion of the star.

In massive stars (greater than about 1.5 {{Solar mass|link=yes}}), the core temperature is above about 1.8×10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; [[Kelvin|K]], so [[hydrogen]]-to-[[helium]] [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] occurs primarily via the [[CNO cycle]]. In the CNO cycle, the energy generation rate scales as the temperature to the 15th power, whereas the rate scales as the temperature to the 4th power in the proton-proton chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt |Hansen|Kawaler|Trimble|2004|loc=Tbl. 1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the strong temperature sensitivity of the CNO cycle, the temperature gradient in the inner portion of the star is steep enough to make the core [[Convection zone|convective]]. In the outer portion of the star, the temperature gradient is shallower but the temperature is high enough that the hydrogen is nearly fully ionized, so the star remains transparent to ultraviolet radiation. Thus, massive stars have a [[Radiation zone|radiative]] envelope.

The lowest mass main sequence stars have no radiation zone; the dominant energy transport mechanism throughout the star is convection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt |Hansen|Kawaler|Trimble|2004|loc=§2.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equations of stellar structure==
{{see also|Mass-luminosity relation|Polytrope}}
The simplest commonly used [[Stellar model|model]] of stellar structure is the spherically symmetric quasi-static model, which assumes that a [[star]] is in a [[steady state]] and that it is [[symmetry|spherically symmetric]]. It contains four basic first-order [[differential equations]]: two represent how [[matter]] and [[pressure]] vary with radius; two represent how [[temperature]] and [[luminosity]] vary with radius.&lt;ref&gt;This discussion follows those of, e.&amp;nbsp;g., {{harvtxt |Zeilik|Gregory|1998|loc=§16-1–16-2}} and {{harvtxt |Hansen|Kawaler|Trimble|2004|loc=§7.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In forming the '''stellar structure equations''' (exploiting the assumed spherical symmetry), one considers the matter [[density]] &lt;math&gt;\rho(r)&lt;/math&gt;, [[temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T(r)&lt;/math&gt;, total [[pressure]] (matter plus radiation) &lt;math&gt;P(r)&lt;/math&gt;, [[luminosity]] &lt;math&gt;l(r)&lt;/math&gt;, and energy generation rate per unit mass &lt;math&gt;\epsilon(r)&lt;/math&gt; in a spherical shell of a thickness &lt;math&gt;\mbox{d}r&lt;/math&gt; at a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from the center of the star. The star is assumed to be in [[local thermodynamic equilibrium]] (LTE) so the temperature is identical for [[matter]] and [[photons]]. Although LTE does not strictly hold because the temperature a given shell "sees" below itself is always hotter than the temperature above, this approximation is normally excellent because the photon [[mean free path]], &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, is much smaller than the length over which the temperature varies considerably, i. e. &lt;math&gt;\lambda \ll T/|\nabla T|&lt;/math&gt;.

First is a statement of ''[[hydrostatic equilibrium]]:'' the outward force due to the [[pressure gradient]] within the star is exactly balanced by the inward force due to [[gravity]].  This is sometimes referred to as stellar equilibrium.
:&lt;math&gt; {\mbox{d} P \over \mbox{d} r} = - { G m \rho \over r^2 } &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;m(r)&lt;/math&gt; is the cumulative mass inside the shell at &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]]. The cumulative mass increases with radius according to the ''[[continuity equation|mass continuity equation]]:''
:&lt;math&gt; {\mbox {d} m \over \mbox{d} r} = 4 \pi r^2 \rho .&lt;/math&gt;

[[Integral|Integrating]] the mass continuity equation from the star center (&lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt;) to the radius of the star (&lt;math&gt;r=R&lt;/math&gt;) yields the total mass of the star.

Considering the energy leaving the spherical shell yields the ''energy equation:''
:&lt;math&gt; {\mbox{d} l \over \mbox{d} r} = 4 \pi r^2 \rho ( \epsilon - \epsilon_\nu )&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the luminosity produced in the form of [[neutrinos]] (which usually escape the star without interacting with ordinary matter) per unit mass. Outside the core of the star, where nuclear reactions occur, no energy is generated, so the luminosity is constant.

The energy transport equation takes differing forms depending upon the mode of energy transport. For conductive energy transport (appropriate for a [[white dwarf]]), the energy equation is
:&lt;math&gt; {\mbox{d} T \over \mbox{d} r} = - {1 \over k} { l \over 4 \pi r^2 },&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k'' is the [[thermal conductivity]].

In the case of radiative energy transport, appropriate for the inner portion of a solar mass [[main sequence]] star and the outer envelope of a massive main sequence star,
:&lt;math&gt; {\mbox{d} T \over \mbox{d} r} = - {3 \kappa \rho l \over 64 \pi r^2 \sigma T^3},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[opacity (optics)|opacity]] of the matter, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stefan-Boltzmann constant]], and the [[Boltzmann constant]] is set to one.

The case of convective energy transport does not have a known rigorous mathematical formulation, and involves [[turbulence]] in the gas. Convective energy transport is usually modeled using [[mixing length theory]]. This treats the gas in the star as containing discrete elements which roughly retain the temperature, density, and pressure of their surroundings but move through the star as far as a characteristic length, called the ''mixing length''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hansen|Kawaler|Trimble|2004|loc=§5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a [[monatomic]] [[ideal gas]], when the convection is [[adiabatic]], meaning that the convective gas bubbles don't exchange heat with their surroundings, mixing length theory yields
:&lt;math&gt; {\mbox{d} T \over \mbox{d} r} = \left(1 - {1 \over \gamma} \right) {T \over P } { \mbox{d} P \over \mbox{d} r},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma = c_p / c_v&lt;/math&gt; is the [[adiabatic index]], the ratio of [[specific heat]]s in the gas. (For a fully ionized [[ideal gas]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 5/3&lt;/math&gt;.) When the convection is not adiabatic, the true temperature gradient is not given by this equation. For example, in the Sun the convection at the base of the convection zone, near the core, is adiabatic but that near the surface is not. The mixing length theory contains two free parameters which must be set to make the model fit observations, so it is a [[phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] theory rather than a rigorous mathematical formulation.&lt;ref name="Ostlie"&gt;Ostlie, Dale A. and Carrol, Bradley W., [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0805304029 ''An introduction to Modern Stellar Astrophysics''], Addison-Wesley (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also required are the [[equation of state|equations of state]], relating the pressure, opacity and energy generation rate to other local variables appropriate for the material, such as temperature, density, chemical composition, etc.  Relevant equations of state for pressure may have to include the perfect gas law, radiation pressure, pressure due to degenerate electrons, etc. Opacity cannot be expressed exactly by a single formula. It is calculated for various compositions at specific densities and temperatures and presented in tabular form.&lt;ref name="Rogers1996"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stellar structure ''codes'' (meaning computer programs calculating the model's variables) either interpolate in a density-temperature grid to obtain the opacity needed, or use a [[curve fitting|fitting function]] based on the tabulated values. A similar situation occurs for accurate calculations of the pressure equation of state. Finally, the nuclear energy generation rate is computed from [[nuclear physics]] experiments, using ''reaction networks'' to compute reaction rates for each individual reaction step and equilibrium abundances for each isotope in the gas.&lt;ref name="Ostlie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heger2002"&gt;{{Citation

Combined with a set of [[boundary conditions]], a solution of these equations completely describes the behavior of the star. Typical boundary conditions set the values of the observable parameters appropriately at the surface (&lt;math&gt;r=R&lt;/math&gt;) and center (&lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt;) of the star: &lt;math&gt;P(R) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, meaning the pressure at the surface of the star is zero; &lt;math&gt;m(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, there is no mass inside the center of the star, as required if the mass density remains [[Wikt:finite|finite]]; &lt;math&gt;m(R) = M&lt;/math&gt;, the total mass of the star is the star's mass; and &lt;math&gt;T(R) = T_{eff}&lt;/math&gt;, the temperature at the surface is the [[effective temperature]] of the star.

Although nowadays stellar evolution models describe the main features of [[color magnitude diagram]]s, important improvements have to be made in order to remove uncertainties which are linked to the limited knowledge of transport phenomena. The most difficult challenge remains the numerical treatment of turbulence.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Some research teams are developing simplified modelling of turbulence in 3D calculations.

==Rapid evolution==
The above simplified model is not adequate without modification in situations when the composition changes are sufficiently rapid. The equation of hydrostatic equilibrium may need to be modified by adding a radial acceleration term if the radius of the star is changing very quickly, for example if the star is radially pulsating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 1870 the institution was granted [[land-grant college]] status under the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act]] of 1862.&lt;ref name=SystemHistory /&gt;  The act led to the founding of the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy as an offshoot of the main campus in Columbia.

At that time, the campus was known as ''Missouri State University.'']]
On January 9, 1892, [[Academic Hall]], the institution's main building, burned in a fire that gutted the building, leaving little more standing than six stone [[Ionic columns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=History of the Columns| publisher= University of Missouri Office of Web Communications| url =http://www.missouri.edu/about/history/columns.php| accessdate =November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the administration of [[Governor of Missouri|Missouri Governor]] [[David R. Francis]], the university was rebuilt, with additions that shaped the modern institution.

After the fire, some state residents tried to have the university moved further west to [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]]; but Columbia rallied support to keep it.  The columns were retained as a symbol of the historic campus.  Today they are surrounded by the [[Francis Quadrangle]], the oldest part of campus. At the quad's southern end is [[Academic Hall]]'s replacement, [[Jesse Hall]], named for [[Richard Henry Jesse|Richard Jesse]] (the president of the university at the time of the fire). Built in 1895, Jesse Hall holds many administrative offices and Jesse Auditorium. The buildings surrounding the quad were constructed of red brick, leading to this area becoming known as [[Red Campus]]. The area was tied together in planned landscaping and walks in 1910 by [[George Kessler]] in a [[City Beautiful movement|City Beautiful]] design of the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgekessler.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=43 georgekessler.org – Retrieved July 13, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808051207/http://www.georgekessler.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=43 |date=August 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Hall is scheduled for a $9.8 mil. makeover to include a fire sprinkler system, work on its elevators, and a new heating and cooling system as part of a $92 mil. total renovation package the Board of Curators approved in June 2013. This upgrade is expected to be completed in March 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/million-in-campus-upgrades-headed-for-mizzou/article_6e680f15-8c22-558e-8020-05117c9b5148.html|title=$92 Million in Campus Upgrades Headed for Mizzou|last=Barker|first=Tim|date=June 13, 2013|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the east of the quadrangle, later buildings constructed of white limestone in 1913 and 1914 to accommodate the new academic programs became known as the White Campus. In 1908 the world's first journalism school opened at MU. It became notable for its "Missouri Method" of hands-on, experience-based instruction. It later established an award for "Distinguished Journalism".

In April 1923, a black janitor was accused of the rape of the daughter of a University of Missouri professor. James T. Scott was abducted from the Boone County jail by a mob of townsfolk and students, and was [[lynching|lynched]] to death from a bridge near the campus before his trial took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/local-leaders-mark-1923-lynching-of-u-of-missouri-janitor/28206|title=Local Leaders Mark 1923 Lynching of U. of Missouri Janitor|last=Mytelka|first=Andrew|date=November 9, 2010|work=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of 1935, four graduates of [[Lincoln University (Missouri)|Lincoln University]]—a [[historically black colleges and universities|traditionally black school]] about {{convert|30|mi|km|0}} away in [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]]—were denied admission to MU's graduate school. One of the students, [[Lloyd L. Gaines]], brought his case to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. On December 12, 1938, in a landmark 6–2 decision, the court ordered the State of Missouri to admit Gaines to MU's law school or provide a facility of equal stature. Gaines disappeared in Chicago on March 19, 1939, under suspicious circumstances. The university granted Gaines a posthumous honorary law degree in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2006/may/20060514News023.asp "MU awards law degree to kin of rights pioneer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828060131/http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2006/may/20060514News023.asp |date=August 28, 2015 }} by Alan Scher Zagier, ''Columbia Daily Tribune'', May 14, 2006, retrieved on August 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Undergraduate divisions were integrated by court order in 1950, when the university was compelled to admit African Americans to courses that were not offered at Lincoln University.

On June 5, 1935, the university erected a memorial to the Confederate soldiers of Missouri popularly known as the Confederate Rock. The monument was removed in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Confederate Rock|url=http://umcspace.missouri.edu/historic/buildings/ConfederateRock/general.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530070350/http://umcspace.missouri.edu/historic/buildings/ConfederateRock/general.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 30, 2010|website=MU in Brick and Mortar|publisher=University of Missouri|accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, the enrollment at universities around the country grew at an extraordinary pace, and MU was no exception. This was due in part to the [[G.I. Bill]], which allowed veterans to attend college with the assistance of the federal government.

Following the [[2015–16 University of Missouri protests]], the chancellor and [[University of Missouri System|System president]] resigned, amid racial complaints by students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wibw.com/home/headlines/The-Latest-University-of-Missouri-System-president-resigns-343731172.html|title=University of Missouri Chancellor Follows President in Stepping Down|author=Viviani|first=Nick|date=November 9, 2015|website=[[WIBW-TV]]|publisher=|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[File:University of Missouri - Memorial Union.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Tower of [[Memorial Union (University of Missouri)|Memorial Union]]]]

The campus of the University of Missouri is {{convert|1262|acre|sqmi ha|1|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="MissouriEDU" /&gt; just south of [[Downtown Columbia, Missouri|Downtown Columbia]] and is maintained as a [[botanical garden]]. The historical campus is centered on [[Francis Quadrangle]], a [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]] listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and contains a number of buildings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The academic buildings are classified into two main groups: [[Red Campus]] and White Campus. Red Campus is the historical core of mostly brick academic buildings around the landmark columns of the [[Francis Quadrangle]]; it includes Jesse Hall and [[Switzler Hall]]. In the early 20th century, the College of Agriculture began a period of rapid expansion in which several buildings were constructed to accommodate the growing program and student body. The new buildings, constructed in Neo-Gothic style from native Missouri [[limestone]], form the White Campus. Its most notable building is [[Memorial Union (University of Missouri)|Memorial Union]].

During the 1990s, Red Campus was extended to the south with the creation of the Carnahan Quadrangle. Hulston Hall of the [[University of Missouri School of Law]], completed in 1988, formed the eastern border of the future quad. The Reynolds Alumni Center was completed in 1992 on the west side of the new quad. It was completed in 2002 with Cornell Hall of the [[Trulaske College of Business]] and Tiger Plaza. Plans for a new plaza on the north end of the Carnahan Quadrangle were unveiled in 2014. Called Traditions Plaza, it was opened on October 25, 2014 during homecoming festivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mizzou.com/s/1002/alumni/interior.aspx?sid=1002&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=4174|title=Traditions Plaza|last=|first=|date=|website=Mizzou Alumni Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602101723/http://www.mizzou.com/s/1002/alumni/interior.aspx?sid=1002&amp;gid=1001&amp;pgid=4174|archive-date=2016-06-02|dead-url=yes|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the original MU intercollegiate athletic facilities, such as [[Rollins Field]] and Rothwell Gymnasium, were just south of the academic buildings, later expanded facilities were constructed across Stadium Boulevard, where [[Memorial Stadium (Columbia)|Memorial Stadium]] opened in 1926. The [[Hearnes Center]] was built to the east of the stadium in 1972. In 1994, the university developed the first draft of a master plan for the campus to tie together all of Tiger athletic facilities to the south of Stadium Boulevard and add to its design. Today, the MU Sports Park includes the [[Mizzou Arena]], [[Taylor Stadium]], [[Audrey J. Walton Stadium (Columbia, Missouri)|Walton Stadium]], Mizzou Athletics Training Complex, University Field and Devine Pavilion.  Student athletic facilities remain in the core area of campus. Rothwell Gymnasium and Brewer Fieldhouse are part of the {{convert|283579|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Student Recreation Center, which was ranked number one in the nation in 2005 by ''[[Sports Illustrated]].''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colotime.com/pdf/University%20of%20Missouri.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themaneater.com/stories/campus/rec-center-receives-national-recognition|title=Rec Center Receives National Attention|last=Lewis|first=Megan|date=February 17, 2012|work=[[The Maneater]]|access-date=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main campus of the [[University of Missouri Health Care|University of Missouri Hospitals and Clinics]] is north of the sports complex. It includes the [[University of Missouri Hospital]] and [[Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital]]. Two of the hospitals, [[Columbia Regional Hospital]] and [[Ellis Fischel Cancer Center]], are northeast of the main campus near I-70.

[[File:Mizzou TigerPlazaFountain.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A fountain and statue make up Tiger Plaza on the Carnahan Quadrangle.]]

To the south of the MU Sports Park is the MU Research Park. It includes the University of Missouri Research Reactor Center, International Institute for Nano and Molecular Medicine, MU Life Science Business Incubator at Monsanto Place, and Dalton Cardiovascular Research Center. In 2005, the University of Missouri Board of Curators approved legislation to designate the South Farm of the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (CAFNR) as a research park. The {{convert|114|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} park, {{convert|3|mi|km|1|spell=in}} southeast of the main campus on US63, is now known as Discovery Ridge Research Park. Tenants at Discovery Ridge include ABC Laboratories and the MU Research Animal Diagnostic Laboratory.

The main campus is flanked to the east and west by Greek Life housing. The University of Missouri has nearly 50 national social fraternities and sororities, many of which occupy historical residences now valued in the millions of dollars. [[Beta Sigma Psi]], [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Zeta Phi|Beta Theta Pi]], [[Alpha Gamma Rho]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] and [[Sigma Nu]] form a Greek Row (also called Frat Row) along College Avenue in the [[East Campus (University of Missouri)|East Campus]] area. [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], and [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] are in the West Campus area along Stewart Street, which leads directly into the [[Francis Quadrangle]]. Most of the Greek-letter organizations are in a Greek Town, with approximately 30 Greek residences, to the north of Memorial Stadium.{{clear left}}

The main campus, along with all other MU-owned or operated facilities, is protected by the [[University of Missouri Police Department]], which is in the Virginia Avenue parking garage on the main campus.

In 1908, the [[Missouri School of Journalism]] (known colloquially as the "J-school"), was founded in Columbia, claiming to be the first of its kind internationally. The French established their ''[[Ecole Supérieure de Journalisme de Paris]]'' in 1899.&lt;ref name="esj-paris.com"&gt;[http://www.esj-paris.com "''École supérieure de journalisme''"], Official website {{fr}}, accessed July 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The UM System owns and operates [[KOMU-TV]], the [[NBC]]/[[The CW|CW]] affiliate for Columbia and nearby [[Jefferson City]]. It is a full-fledged commercial station and a working lab for journalism students. The MU School of Journalism publishes the ''[[Columbia Missourian]]'' and ''Vox Magazine,''&lt;ref&gt;Vox Magazine: http://www.voxmagazine.com/&lt;/ref&gt; where students learn reporting, editing and design in a newsroom managed by professional editors.  It operates the local National Public Radio Station KBIA and produces ''Radio Adelante'', a Spanish-language radio program.

Founded in 1978 after 23 years as a unit of the School of Medicine, the School of Health Professions became an autonomous division in December 2000. The school's five departments and eight accredited academic programs have a long history, some dating to the early 20th century. It is Missouri's only state-supported school of health professions on a campus with an academic health center, and the only allied health school in the UM system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shp.missouri.edu/visitors/history.php "History of the School of Health Professions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601154842/http://shp.missouri.edu/visitors/history.php |date=June 1, 2010 }}, University of Missouri&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ellis Library.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Ellis Library]], the main library of the university]]

The university maintains the largest library collection in the State of Missouri. As of the 2011–12 academic year, the collection held 3.1 million volumes, 8.1 million microforms, 678,596 e-books, almost 1.7 million government documents, more than 284,000 print maps, and more than 53,000 journal subscriptions.&lt;ref name="MissouriEDU" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/about/facts.htm |title=Facts about the Libraries |publisher=Mulibraries.missouri.edu |date=December 3, 2012 |accessdate=June 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610014048/http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/about/facts.htm |archivedate=June 10, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection is housed in [[Ellis Library]], the University Archives, and seven other specialized academic libraries across campus.&lt;ref name="MissouriEDU" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/collections/default.htm |title=MU Libraries and Collections |publisher=MU Libraries |date=June 3, 2013 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the original collection, housed in [[Academic Hall]], was lost in the 1892 fire.

During the [[American Civil War]], Union troops used the Library in Academic Hall as a guard room. The Union troops caused significant damage, including taking 467 volumes to build fires. The Board of Curators later sued the US Army for the destruction on campus. Settled in 1915, the suit's award was used to build the Memorial Gateway on the northern edge of Red Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://muarchives.missouri.edu/libraryex.html |title=The Heart of the University: MU Libraries |publisher=Muarchives.missouri.edu |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, construction began on a new main library, completed in 1915. It was expanded in 1935, 1958, and 1985. It was dedicated as Elmer Ellis Library on October 10, 1972, in honor of the thirteenth president of the University of Missouri. Today, the MU libraries are home to the 47th largest research collection in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/journalism/afflibraries.htm |title=JLib affiliated libraries |publisher=Mulibraries.missouri.edu |accessdate=October 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930190002/http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/journalism/afflibraries.htm |archivedate=September 30, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jeffrey E. Smith Institute of Real Estate was founded in 2005 by a donation from alumnus Jeffrey Smith to meet the growing interest of students in the College of Business, seeking to learn more about the real estate industry.

The University of Missouri is organized into seven colleges, eleven schools and hosts approximately 300 majors.

===Name===
Upon creation of the system, each university was renamed with its host city; thus, the university in Columbia became the University of Missouri–Columbia. In the proceeding decades, colloquial and verbal usage of the generic name in reference to MU continued. There were attempts to drop Columbia from its name by students, faculty, alumni, and administrators who felt it might cause the university to be perceived as a regional institution. This change was long resisted by the UM System and the other universities on the basis of uniformity and fairness. However, after a renewed effort for "name restoration", the Board of Curators voted unanimously on November 29, 2007 to allow MU to drop Columbia from its name for all public use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.missouri.edu/news/name-restoration.php |title=UM Curators recognize historic status of MU |publisher=Missouri.edu |accessdate=October 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014957/http://www.missouri.edu/news/name-restoration.php |archivedate=September 27, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Continued use of the name University of Missouri–Columbia is not incorrect but is being phased out by MU, except as required on official internal documents within the UM System. Its use also continues to be advocated by some faculty, administration, and alumni of UMKC, UMSL, and Missouri S&amp;T.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2007/Nov/20071130News002.asp| title=MU name deal ruffles some feathers| publisher=[[Columbia Daily Tribune]]| accessdate=November 19, 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716135449/http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2007/Nov/20071130News002.asp| archivedate=July 16, 2011| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themaneater.com/stories/campus/umsl-opposes-mu-name-change|title=UMSL Opposes MU Name Change|last=Njus|first=Elliot|date=September 21, 2007|work=[[The Maneater]]|access-date=November 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidents and chancellors===
Each campus of the [[University of Missouri System]] is led by a [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]], who reports to the [[University president|president]] of the UM System. Prior to the formation of the system in 1963, the Columbia campus and its offshoot in [[Missouri University of Science and Technology|Rolla]] were led directly by the president and the position of chancellor did not exist. The below contains a list of presidents from 1963–present but does not include [[interim]] presidents or chancellors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://muarchives.missouri.edu/indexLeaders.html |title=University of Missouri Leaders |publisher=Muarchives.missouri.edu |date=September 10, 2002 |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umsystem.edu/ums/president/former.shtml Former presidents of the University of Missouri] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819142254/http://www.umsystem.edu/ums/president/former.shtml |date=August 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  John Lathrop is the only president or chancellor to have served nonconsecutive terms.

==Student life==

===Residential life===
The University of Missouri operates 23 on-campus residence halls and least two other off-campus sites.  The two off-campus locations include: Tiger Diggs at Campus View Apartments and True Scholars House.  Many residence halls on campus offer learning communities and freshman interest groups.  Both programs seek to ensure students succeed academically while living in the residence halls.

Three of the older halls: Jones, Lathrop, and Laws are scheduled to be torn down and replaced as the largest and first part ($71 mil.) of a $92 mil. campus improvement project approved by the Board of Curators on June 13, 2013. The plan also includes replacing the dining hall north of [[Faurot Field]]. The three halls presently can house up to 1,010 students. The new halls will expand the capacity to 1,242 by the time the first part is completed in May 2017. The renovation of Swallow Hall (1893) is also part of the plan, costing $11.5 mil. of the total.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Two residence halls, Excellence and Respect will be on standby starting in the Fall 2016 semester, and only used if necessary because Fall enrollment is expected to drop by 1,500 students, which it did by 2,273 including 1,412 fewer freshmen.&lt;ref name=2016enroll&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/higher_education/fall-mu-freshmen-enrollment-slightly-more-than-projected/article_06176c10-68b1-11e6-af6e-e76aa72886f0.html |title=Fall 2016 MU freshmen enrollment slightly more than projected |website=[[Columbia Missourian]] |date=August 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 319 beds will be used over the summer until August 4, 2016. Both halls will undergo repairs if not needed. The new George C. Brooks Hall will open as planned for the Fall 2016 semester and house 293 students.&lt;ref name=Excellence-Respect&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/higher_education/two-residence-halls-to-be-on-standby-because-of-declining/article_547b3a1c-ffe8-11e5-89e1-4f1175f6e175.html |title=Two residence halls to be on standby because of declining enrollment |website=[[Columbia Missourian]] |date=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three more residence halls will temporarily close in the Fall of 2017: Center, Responsibility, and Discovery. Previously it was announced Respect, Excellence, Schurz and McDavid wouldn't operate in the Fall unless there was sufficient demand to reopen some of them. Combined, the seven halls are capable of housing about 1,500 students. The closures are estimated to save about $2 million, largely through reduced utility costs. The university says two of the closed halls also could get some use as guest and conference housing. The temporary closures come after freshman enrollment dropped 24 percent for this academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/university-of-missouri-to-temporarily-close-more-dorms/article_6e951473-8ee3-5c50-858b-adf1783ad81e.html |title=University of Missouri to temporarily close more dorms |website=''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' |date=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declining enrollment precipitated a budget plan to cut 400 jobs, but most of them are from those resigning or retiring, so less than 100 actual jobs will be eliminated for the 2018 fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/higher_education/mu-budget-proposal-calls-for-eliminating-jobs/article_ad24d9b4-39c8-11e7-9e49-4bd251d5984e.html|title=MU Budget Proposal Calls For Eliminating 400 Jobs|last=Kessel|first=Andrew|date=May 15, 2017|website=[[Columbia Missourian]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groups and activities===
Tap Day is an annual spring ceremony in which the identities of the members of the six secret honor societies are revealed. The participating societies are [[QEBH]], [[Mystical Seven (Missouri)|Mystical Seven]], [[LSV Society|LSV]], [[Omicron Delta Kappa]], [[Mortar Board]], and the Rollins Society. The ceremony, first held in 1927, takes place at the columns on Francis Quadrangle.

The Associated Students of the University of Missouri (ASUM) is a student-run lobbying organization that represents the students' interests in the state and national capitals. ASUM's platform has included issues such as equalizing the "Access Missouri" grant, expanding "Bright Flight" funding, and giving students a vote on the Board of Curators.

The Trulaske Consulting Association was started in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trambu|first=Aamer|title=About us page|url=http://tca.students.missouri.edu/?page_id=51|website=TCA|publisher=TCA|accessdate=November 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302005354/http://tca.students.missouri.edu/?page_id=51|archive-date=March 2, 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relatively new student organization and is open to students of all departments.

==Athletics==
{{main|Missouri Tigers}}
[[File:Faurot Field sunset skyline.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Hearnes Center]], [[Mizzou Arena]], and [[Faurot Field]]]]
The [[Missouri Tigers]] are a member of the [[Southeastern Conference]] with the exception of wrestling, which competes in the [[Mid-American Conference]]. Mizzou is the only school in the state with all of its sports in the [[NCAA Division I]] and a football team that competes in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS).  These are the highest levels of college sports in the United States. The official colors are black and gold.

Athletic sports for the Tigers include men's and women's basketball, baseball, [[cross country running|cross country]], [[American football|football]], golf, gymnastics, swimming &amp; [[Diving (sport)|diving]], [[softball]], track, tennis, volleyball, [[women's soccer]], and [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]]. Historic sports included a shooting club, in which the ladies' team in 1934 won a national championship. Former football coach [[Gary Pinkel]] holds the record at the university for the most wins on the gridiron. Additionally, former basketball coach and alum [[Norm Stewart]] maintains the record for the most wins on the hardcourt.

MU football games are played on [[Faurot Field|Faurot Field at Memorial Stadium ("The Zou")]]. Built in 1926, this stadium has an official capacity of 71,168,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mutigers.com/facilities/?id=1 |title=University of Missouri Athletics |publisher=Mutigers.com |date= |accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and features a nearly {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide "M" behind the north-end zone. Men's and women's basketball games take place at the [[Mizzou Arena]], just south of the football stadium. The [[Hearnes Center]] had hosted men's and women's basketball from 1972 to 2004 and it is still used for other athletic (including wrestling, volleyball, and indoor track and field) and school events.

[[File:Dangerous Women.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Ladies champion team of the Missouri University shooting club, 1934&lt;ref&gt;''National Archieff'', the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Missouri Tiger men's basketball team has had 22 [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearances, the second-most Tournament appearances without a [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship#Final Four|Final Four]]. The Tigers have appeared in the regional finals (Elite Eight) of the [[NCAA]] Tournament six times (twice under coach Norm Stewart, Missouri head coach from 1967 to 1999). The Tigers have won 15 conference championships, beginning with the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], followed by the [[Big Six Conference|Big Six]], the [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]], and the [[Big 12 Conference]]. In 1994, the Tigers went undefeated in the Big Eight to take the regular season title. In 2009, Missouri won its first Big 12 Championship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.big12sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10410&amp;ATCLID=205160610 |title=All-Time Big 12 Championships – Big 12 Conference – Official Athletic Site |publisher=Big12sports.com |date= |accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; over [[Baylor University|Baylor]]. Missouri went on to win its second Big 12 Championship in its final season in the Big 12 in 2012, once again defeating Baylor. Standout players from the Mizzou's basketball team include, [[Anthony Peeler]], John Brown, [[Jon Sundvold]], [[Steve Stipanovich]], [[Kareem Rush]], [[Keyon Dooling]] [[Doug Smith (basketball)|Doug Smith]], Willie Smith, [[Norm Stewart]], [[Linas Kleiza]], [[Derrick Chievous]], [[DeMarre Carroll]], [[Kim English (basketball)|Kim English]]. [[Jordan Clarkson]] and [[Marcus Denmon]].

The official [[mascot]] for Missouri Tigers athletics is [[Truman the Tiger]], created on September 16, 1986. Following a campus-wide contest, Truman was named in honor of [[Harry S. Truman]], the only U.S. president from Missouri. Today, Truman appears to cheer on the team, mingle with supporters at Mizzou athletic events as well as at pep-rallies, alumni association functions, and frequent visits to Columbia-area schools.

On November 24, 2007, the Mizzou football team played against its biggest rival, [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]], at [[Arrowhead Stadium]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. At that time, KU was ranked No. 2 and MU was ranked No. 3 nationally. At the end of the [[Border Showdown|game]], Mizzou defeated KU, 36–28. The following day MU was ranked No. 1 in the country for the second time in its history.
On December 1, 2007, the Mizzou football team lost the Big 12 Championship game in [[San Antonio, Texas]], to [[University of Oklahoma|Oklahoma]] 38–17, falling out of national title and Bowl Championship Series contention. The team regrouped and played in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]] January 1, 2008, at [[Dallas, Texas]], defeating [[University of Arkansas|Arkansas]], 38–7. In the final [[Associated Press]] "Top 25 football poll" of the 2007 season, Mizzou was ranked No. 4 in the country, its highest finishing position in the team's history.

On November 6, 2011, the University of Missouri announced it would leave the [[Big 12 Conference]] to join the [[Southeastern Conference]] effective July 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/sports/ncaabasketball/missouris-shift-to-the-sec-ignites-a-war-of-words.html|title=Missouri to SEC Ignites a War of Words|last=Associated Press|first=|date=November 12, 2011|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=March 6, 2012|author-link=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, the school's wrestling team became an associate member of the [[Mid-American Conference]], as the SEC does not sponsor wrestling.

On December 7, 2013, Mizzou played in the SEC Championship Game in [[Atlanta]] in the [[Georgia Dome]] against [[Auburn University|Auburn]]. The teams were ranked 5th and 3rd, respectively in the nation. Mizzou fell to the eventual national runners-up 59-42, and ended up playing in the [[2014 Cotton Bowl Classic]] in [[Dallas]]. Missouri (#9) defeated [[Oklahoma State University|Oklahoma State]] (#13) 41-31, winning their second Cotton Bowl Classic.&lt;ref&gt;[[2014 Cotton Bowl Classic#Missouri]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, 2014, #17 Mizzou played #1 [[University of Alabama|Alabama]] in its second consecutive SEC Championship Game falling to the Crimson Tide, 42-13. Mizzou went on to play [[University of Minnesota|Minnesota]] in the [[Citrus Bowl]], winning 33-17 and finishing #16 in the nation.

The Tiger Walk is held annually before the fall semester in the Quad, as welcome and orientation for new students to the university. Students can meet and also learn about school organizations, which have stations around the Quad. After hearing of the four pillars of success, students walk in procession through the quad and the Columns toward Jesse Hall, symbolizing their entrance into the university.  Tiger Prowl is held for graduation seniors on the Quad. They walk through the columns, away from Jesse Hall, to symbolize becoming alumni. Refreshments, such as famous tiger stripe ice cream, are provided after the ceremony.

===Official song===
[[File:House Decs at Dawn.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Students working on house decorations, a yearly [[Homecoming]] tradition for fraternities and sororities]]

The university song is "Old Missouri".  With lyrics written in 1895, it is sung to the tune of "[[Annie Lisle]]."

&lt;poem&gt;''First verse:''
Old Missouri, fair Missouri
Dear old Varsity.
Ours are hearts that fondly love thee
Here's a health to thee.

''Chorus:''
Proud art thou in classic beauty
Of thy noble past
With thy watch words: honour, duty,
Thy high fame shall last!

''Second verse:''
Every student, man and maiden
Swells the glad refrain.
'Till the breezes, music-laden
Waft it back again.

''(repeat chorus)''&lt;/poem&gt;

===Homecoming===
In 1911, athletic director [[Chester Brewer]] invited alumni to "come home" for the big football game against the [[University of Kansas]]. A spirit rally and parade were planned as part of the celebration. The [[Council for Advancement and Support of Education]] has called MU's homecoming celebration the best in the nation and a model program {{citation needed|date=January 2018}}. Missouri Homecoming also includes several service elements, and the homecoming [[blood donation|blood drive]] has earned the [[Guinness Record]] as the nation's largest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m4440202_CampusConnections.pdf|title=Red Cross Campus Connections|format=PDF|accessdate=January 5, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108234206/http://www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m4440202_CampusConnections.pdf|archive-date=January 8, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Undergraduate tuition==
The annual tuition for in-state residents for 2016–17 is $9,518 and $25,892 for out-of-state residents, plus $10,298 for room and board on campus with that total not counting books and supplies ($1,344) or transportation ($4,756) expenses.&lt;ref name="MissouriEDU"/&gt; A 1.7% undergraduate increase in tuition and fees was previously approved in the 2014 operating budget by the Board of Curators in June 2013, which also approved salary increases of 1.5% to 3% for the faculty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Notable faculty and alumni==
{{main|List of University of Missouri alumni|List of University of Missouri faculty}}
In the Spring of 2016, there are 300,315 living alumni worldwide. 274,447 reside in the United States, 156,585 in [[Missouri]], 61,346 in the [[Greater St. Louis|St. Louis area]], 30,018 in the [[Kansas City metropolitan area|Kansas City]] area, and 2,718 outside the U.S.&lt;ref name=Alumni /&gt;

In [[astronomy]], the '''variation of the Moon''' is one of the principal [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]]s in the motion of the Moon.

==Discovery==
The variation was discovered by [[Tycho Brahe]], who noticed that, starting from a [[lunar eclipse]] in December 1590, at the times of [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]] (new or full moon), the apparent velocity of motion of the Moon (along its orbit as seen against the background of stars) was faster than expected. On the other hand, at the times of first and last quarter, its velocity was correspondingly slower than expected.  (Those expectations were based on the lunar tables widely used up to Tycho's time.  They took some account of the two largest irregularities in the Moon's motion, i.e. those now known as the [[equation of the center]] and the [[evection]], see also [[Lunar theory#History|Lunar theory - History]].)&lt;ref&gt;V E Thoren, [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1967PASP...79..482T "Tycho and Kepler on the Lunar theory"], Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, vol.79 (1967), pp. 482-489, especially at p.485.  The discovery of the variation was made accidentally, after Tycho planned to observe the lunar eclipse of December 1590, and checked the Moon's position a day or two beforehand, to determine more exactly, as he thought, the starting time. But when he went out to observe just before the expected time, he found that he had missed the start of the eclipse.  The Moon was earlier by about an hour, the eclipse already in progress. Tycho's subsequent investigations pinned down the cause, a previously unrecognized inequality, since then called the variation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variation==
The main visible effect (in longitude) of the variation of the Moon is that during the course of every month, at the octants of the Moon's phase that follow the syzygies (i.e. halfway between the new or the full moon and the next-following quarter), the Moon is about two thirds of a degree farther ahead than would be expected on the basis of its mean motion (as modified by the equation of the centre and by the evection).  But at the octants that precede the syzygies, it is about two thirds of a degree behind.  At the syzygies and quarters themselves, the main effect is on the Moon's velocity rather than its position.

[[image:Variation (astronomy).gif|frame|right|Variational orbit: nearly an ellipse, with the Earth at the center. The diagram illustrates the perturbing effect of the Sun on the Moon's orbit, using some simplifying approximations, e.g. that in the absence of the Sun, the Moon's orbit would be circular with the Earth at its center]]
In 1687 Newton published, in the '[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]', his first steps in the gravitational analysis of the motion of [[Lunar theory#Newton|three mutually-attracting bodies]].  This included a proof that the Variation is one of the results of the perturbation of the motion of the Moon caused by the action of the Sun, and that one of the effects is to distort the Moon's orbit in a practically elliptical manner (ignoring at this point the eccentricity of the Moon's orbit), with the centre of the ellipse occupied by the Earth, and the major axis perpendicular to a line drawn between the Earth and Sun.

The Variation has a period of half a [[synodic month]] and causes the Moon's [[ecliptic longitude]] to vary by nearly two-thirds of a  [[degree (angle)|degree]], more exactly by +2370"sin(2D) where D is the mean elongation of the Moon from the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lunar theory#Delaunay arguments|Lunar theory - Delaunay arguments]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The variational distortion of the Moon's orbit is a different effect from the eccentric elliptical motion of a body in an unperturbed orbit. The Variation effect would still occur if the undisturbed motion of the Moon had an [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] of zero (i.e. [[circle|circular]]).  The eccentric [[Kepler orbit|Keplerian ellipse]] is another and separate approximation for the Moon's orbit, different from the approximation represented by the (central) variational ellipse.  The Moon's line of apses, i.e. the long axis of the Moon's orbit when approximated as an eccentric ellipse, rotates once in about nine years, so that it can be oriented at any angle whatever relative to the direction of the Sun at any season. (The angular difference between these two directions used to be referred to, in much older literature, as the "annual argument of the Moon's apogee".) Twice in every period of just over a year, the direction of the Sun coincides with the direction of the long axis of the eccentric elliptical approximation of the Moon's orbit (as projected on to the ecliptic).

==Elliptical distortion==
Thus the (central) elliptical distortion of the Moon's orbit caused by the variation should not be confused with an undisturbed eccentric elliptical motion of an orbiting body. The variational effects due to the Sun would still occur even if the hypothetical undisturbed motion of the Moon had an eccentricity of zero (i.e. even if the orbit would be circular in the absence of the Sun).

Newton expressed an approximate recognition that the real orbit of the Moon is not exactly an eccentric Keplerian ellipse, nor exactly a central ellipse due to the variation, but "an oval of another kind".&lt;ref&gt;D T Whiteside (ed.) (1973), ''The Mathematical papers of Isaac Newton, Volume VI: 1684-1691'', Cambridge University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lIZ0v23iqRgC&amp;pg=PA533&amp;lpg=PA533 at page 533].&lt;/ref&gt; Newton did not give an explicit expression for the form of this "oval of another kind"; to an approximation, it combines the two effects of the central-elliptical variational orbit and the Keplerian eccentric ellipse. Their combination also continually changes its shape as the annual argument changes, and also as the evection shows itself in libratory changes in the eccentricity, and in the direction, of the long axis of the eccentric ellipse.

The Variation is the second-largest solar perturbation of the Moon's orbit after the Evection, and the third-largest inequality in the motion of the Moon altogether; (the first and largest of the lunar inequalities is the [[equation of the centre]], a result of the eccentricity &amp;ndash; which is not an effect of solar perturbation).

[[File:Sample conworld.jpg|frame|A rendered constructed world as seen from [[outer space]]]]
'''Worldbuilding''' is the process of constructing an imaginary world, sometimes associated with a whole [[fictional universe]].&lt;ref name=hamilton2009/&gt; The resulting world may be called a '''constructed world'''. Developing an imaginary setting with coherent qualities such as a [[history]], [[Fictional geography|geography]], and [[ecology]] is a key task for many science fiction or [[fantasy]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Brian M. |last=Stableford |year=2004 |title=Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=0-8108-4938-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldbuilding often involves the creation of [[Fantasy map|map]]s, a [[backstory]], and people for the world.  Constructed worlds can enrich the backstory and history of fictional works, and it is not uncommon for authors to revise their constructed worlds while completing its associated work. Constructed worlds can be created for personal amusement and [[Cognitive training|mental exercise]], or for specific creative endeavors such as [[novel]]s, [[video game]]s, or [[role-playing game]]s.

== Etymology ==
The term "world-building" was first used in the ''Edinburgh Review'' in December 1820&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | World}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in A.S. Eddington's ''Space Time and Gravitation: An Outline of the General Relativity Theory'' (1920) to describe the thinking out of hypothetical worlds with different physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddington|first1=Arthur Stanley|title=Space, Time and Gravitation : an outline of the general relativity theory|date=1920|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/spacetimegravita00eddirich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used in [[science fiction]] and fantasy criticism since appearing in R.A. Lupoff’s ''Edgar Rice Burroughs: Master of Adventure'' (1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780199891405|title=Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction|editor=Jeff Prucher|page=270|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The creation of literary fictional worlds was first examined by fantasy authors such as [[George MacDonald]], [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], and [[C. S. Lewis]].&lt;ref name="MarkWolf"&gt;{{cite book|title=Building Imaginary Worlds: The Theory and History of Subcreation|author=Mark J.P. Wolf|isbn=9781136220814|publisher=Routledge|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien addressed the issue in his essay ''On Fairy Stories'', where he stated that the "Secondary World" or "Sub-Creation" (the constructed world) is substantially different from the art of play-writing: "Very little about trees as trees can be got into a play."&lt;ref name="OnFairyStories"&gt;{{citation|title=On Fairy Stories|author=J. R. R. Tolkien|work=The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays|editor=Christopher Tolkien|pp=109–161|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed worlds shift away from storytelling, narrative, characters and figures, and may explore "trees as trees" or aspects of the world in-and-of-themselves. Later analysis of fantasy worlds in the 1960s contextualized them in the medium or the narrative of the works, offering an analysis of the stories in the world, but not the world itself. [[Media franchise]]s are similar to constructed worlds but do not necessarily rely on them; for example a media franchise such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' has a constructed world, while [[The Beatles]], as a franchise, does not. In the 2000s, world-building in film has increased in popularity. When before, writers sought to create a character that could sustain multiple stories, now they create a world that can sustain multiple characters and stories.&lt;ref name="MarkWolf" /&gt;

==Methods==
Worldbuilding can be designed from [[Top-down and bottom-up design|the top down or the bottom up]], or by a combination of these approaches. The official world-building guidelines for ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' refer to these terms as "outside-in" and "inside-out", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first1=Monte |last1=Cook |authorlink1=Monte Cook |first2=Jonathan |last2=Tweet |authorlink2=Jonathan Tweet |first3=Skip |last3=Williams |authorlink3=Skip Williams |others=revised by [[David Noonan (game designer)|David Noonan]] and [[Rich Redman]] |year=2003 |title=[[Dungeon Master's Guide]] |publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] |isbn=0-7869-2889-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the top-down approach, the [[designer]] first creates a general overview of the world, determining broad characteristics such as the world's inhabitants, [[technology]] level, major geographic features, [[climate]], and history. From there, he or she develops the rest of the world in increasing detail. This approach might involve creation of the world's basics, followed by levels such as [[continent]]s, [[civilization]]s, [[Fictional country|nation]]s, [[Fictional city|cities]], and [[town]]s. A world constructed from the top down tends to be well-integrated, with individual components fitting together appropriately. It can, however, require considerable work before enough detail is completed for the setting to be useful, such as in the setting of a story.

With the bottom-up approach, the designer focuses on a small part of the world needed for his or her purposes. This location is given considerable detail, such as local geography, [[culture]], [[social structure]], [[government]], [[politics]], [[commerce]], and history. Prominent local individuals may be described, including their [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] to each other. The surrounding areas are then described in a lower level of detail, with description growing more general with increasing distance from the initial location. The designer can subsequently enhance the description of other areas in the world. This approach provides for almost immediate applicability of the setting, with details pertinent to a certain story or situation. The approach can yield a world plagued with [[Consistency|inconsistencies]], however. By combining the top-down and bottom-up approaches, a designer can enjoy the benefits of both. This is very hard to accomplish, however, because the need to start from both sides creates twice as much work, which may delay the desired product.

Despite requiring considerable work to develop enough detail for a setting to be useful, not every aspect of a setting can be explored, and instead an approach called inferred world building is often used. Inferred world building is when the author provides enough detail about the various parts of a setting that readers can extrapolate on what is written to come to their own conclusions regarding specific details that weren't provided. This is especially useful for roleplaying game settings, as individual games may require certain details to be created on a case-by-case basis for the RPG's story to function.

==Elements==
From a game-design perspective, the goal of worldbuilding is to create the context for a story. Consistency is an important element, since the world provides a foundation for the action of a story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Francois Dominic |last=Laramee |year=2002 |title=Game design perspectives |publisher=Charles River Media |isbn=1-58450-090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, J. R. R. Tolkien described the goal of worldbuilding as creating immersion, or "enchantment" as he put it, and descriptions of the world can be wholly disconnected from the story and narrative.&lt;ref name="OnFairyStories" /&gt;

An uninhabited world can be useful for certain purposes, especially in science fiction, but the majority of constructed worlds have one or more [[Sentience|sentient]] [[species]]. These species can have [[constructed culture]]s and [[constructed language]]s. Designers in [[hard science fiction]] may design [[flora]] and [[fauna]] towards the end of the worldbuilding process, thus creating lifeforms with environmental adaptations to scientifically novel situations.

===Physics===
Perhaps the most basic consideration of worldbuilding is to what degree a fictional world will be based on real-world [[physics]] compared to [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. While magic is a more common element of fantasy settings, science fiction worlds can contain magic or technological equivalents of it. For example, the Biotics in the science fiction video game series ''[[Mass Effect]]'' have abilities, described scientifically in-game, which mirror those of [[Magician (fantasy)|mages]] in fantasy games. In the science fiction novel ''[[Midnight at the Well of Souls]]'', magic exists, but is explained scientifically.

Some fictional worlds modify the real-world [[Physical law|laws of physics]]; [[faster-than-light]] travel is a common factor in much science fiction. Worldbuilding may combine physics and magic, such as in the ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series and the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.

===Cosmology===
Constructed worlds often have cosmologies, both in the [[Physical cosmology|scientific]] and [[Religious cosmology|metaphysical]] senses of the word. Design of science fiction worlds, especially those with [[spacefaring]] societies, usually entails creation of a [[star system]] and [[planet]]s. If the designer wishes to apply real-life principles of astronomy, he or she may develop detailed [[Astronomy|astronomical]] measures for the [[orbit]] of the world, and to define the physical characteristics of the other bodies in the same system; this establishes [[Chronology|chronological]] parameters, such as the length of a day and the durations of [[season]]s.&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{cite book |first=Poul |last=Anderson |authorlink=Poul Anderson |year=1991 |chapter=The Creation of Imaginary Worlds |title=Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-312-06003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some systems are intentionally bizarre. For [[Larry Niven]]'s novels ''[[The Integral Trees]]'' and ''[[The Smoke Ring (novel)|The Smoke Ring]]'', Niven designed a "freefall" environment, a gas [[torus]] ring of habitable pressure, temperature, and composition, around a [[neutron star]].

Fantasy worlds can also involve unique cosmologies. In ''Dungeons and Dragons'', the physical world is referred to as the Prime Material Plane, but other planes of existence devoted to moral or elemental concepts are available for play, such as the [[Spelljammer]] setting, which provides an entirely novel fantasy astrophysical system. Some fantasy worlds feature religions. The ''[[The Elder Scrolls|Elder Scrolls]]'' series, for example, contains a variety of religions practiced by its world's various races. The world of the 2000 video game ''[[Summoner (video game)|Summoner]]'' has a well-developed cosmology, including a [[creation myth]].

===Geography{{anchor|Map making}}===
Map construction is often one of the earliest tasks of worldbuilding. Maps can lay out a world's basic [[terrain]] features and significant civilizations present. A clear, concise map that displays the locations of key points in the story can be a helpful tool for developers and audiences alike. Finished creative products, such as books, may contain published versions of development maps; many editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', for example, include maps of [[Middle-earth]]. [[Cartography]] of fictional worlds is sometimes called ''geofiction''.&lt;ref name=map_hacks2005&gt;{{citation |first1=Schuyler |last1=Erle |first2=Rich |last2=Gibson |first3=Jo |last3=Walsh |isbn=0-596-00703-5 |page=508 |title=Mapping hacks: tips &amp; tools for electronic cartography |series=Hacks Series |publisher=O'Reilly Media |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CiO5JtP171oC&amp;pg=PA508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[physical geography]] of a fictional world is important in designing [[weather]] patterns and [[biome]]s such as [[desert]]s, [[wetlands]], [[mountain]]s, and [[forest]]s. These physical features also affect the growth and interaction of the various societies, such as the establishment of [[trade route]]s and locations of important cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steven S. |last=Long |year=2002 |title=Fantasy HERO |pages=290&amp;ndash;294 |edition=[[Hero System]] Fifth |publisher=DOJ |location=[[San Francisco]] |isbn=1-58366-016-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desire for control of [[natural resource]]s in a fictional world may lead to [[war]] among its people. Geography can also define [[ecosystem]]s for each biome. Often, Earth-like ecology is assumed, but designers can vary drastically from this trend. For example, [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[short story]] "[[The Talking Stone]]" features a life form based on [[silicon]], rather than [[Carbon-based life|carbon.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hal |last=Clement |authorlink=Hal Clement |year=1991 |chapter=The Creation of Imaginary Beings |title=Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] | isbn=0-312-06003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[software]] programs can create random terrain using [[fractal]] algorithms. Sophisticated programs can apply geologic effects such as [[Tectonics|tectonic]] plate movement and [[erosion]]; the resulting world can be [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]] in great detail, providing a degree of realism to the result.

===Culture===
Constructed cultures, or concultures, are a typical element of worldbuilding. Worldbuilders sometimes employ past human civilizations as a model for fictional societies. The 1990 video game ''[[Worlds of Ultima: The Savage Empire]]'', for example, takes place in a world full of [[tribe]]s based on civilizations in early [[Mesoamerica]] and Africa. This method can make a fictional world more accessible for an audience. ''Simon Provencher'' has stated as a 'Golden Rule' of Worldbuilding that "... unless specified otherwise, everything inside your world is assumed to behave exactly as it would in the real world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Provencher|first=Simon|title=The Golden Rule of Worldbuilding|url=http://www.worldbuilderblog.com/the-golden-rule-of-worldbuilding/|work=Worldbuilder|publisher=Simon Provencher|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[Steven S. Long]], a representative of the [[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]] role-playing game, who stated that "Everything that happened in the real world has also unfolded in the exact same way in the Champions Universe." This means any past wars, elections, and technological advancements in our world occurred the same way in the Champions Universe unless explained otherwise.  Creating a cohesive [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] culture can be a distinct challenge. Some designers have also looked to human civilizations for inspiration in doing so, such as ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[Romulan]]s, whose society resembles that of [[Ancient Rome]]. The fictional world's history can explain past and present relationships between different societies, which can introduce a story's action. A past war, for example, functions as a key plot point in the ''[[Shannara]]'' and ''[[Belgariad]]'' series.

==Types of constructed worlds==
Examples of constructed worlds include [[Terry Pratchett]]'s [[Discworld]], the pseudo-Earth [[Hyborian Age]] in the [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan series]], Arrakis in the ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' series, the continent of [[Tamriel]] in the [[Elder Scrolls]] series of games,  [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s [[Earthsea (universe)|Earthsea]] and [[Gethen]], the Subcontinent of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]'', and [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]], the location of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

Constructed worlds are not always limited to one type of story. [[Lawrence Watt-Evans]] and [[Steven Brust]] created [[Ethshar]] and [[Dragaera]], respectively, for role-playing games before using them as settings for novels. [[M. A. R. Barker]] originally designed [[Tékumel]] well before the advent of role-playing games, but many [[gamer]]s, including Barker himself, have used it as a setting for such games.

A [[shared universe]] is a fictional universe that can be used by different authors. Examples of shared universes include the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] and [[campaign setting]] developed specifically for role-playing games. One of the oldest of these is [[Oerth]], developed for the Dungeons and Dragons [[Greyhawk]] setting. [[Forgotten Realms]] is another such D&amp;D setting, originally a [[House rule#Gaming|homebrew]] campaign world by [[Ed Greenwood]].
