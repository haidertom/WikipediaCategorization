The '''32X''' is an [[video game accessory|add-on]] for the [[Sega Genesis]] [[video game console]]. Codenamed "Project Mars", the 32X was designed to expand the power of the Genesis and serve as a transitional console into the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|32-bit era]] until the release of the [[Sega Saturn]]. Independent of the Genesis, the 32X uses its own [[ROM cartridge]]s and has its own [[List of Sega 32X games|library of games]]. The add-on was distributed under the name {{nihongo foot|'''Super 32X'''|スーパー32{{ruby|X|エックス}}|Sūpā Sanjūni Ekkusu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}&lt;!-- See [[WP:JFN]] --&gt; in Japan, '''Genesis 32X''' in North America, '''Mega Drive 32X''' in the [[PAL]] region, and '''Mega 32X''' in Brazil.

Unveiled by [[Sega]] at June 1994's [[Consumer Electronics Show]], the 32X was presented as a low-cost option for consumers looking to play 32-bit games. Developed in response to the [[Atari Jaguar]] and concerns that the Saturn would not make it to market by the end of 1994, the product was conceived as an entirely new console. At the suggestion of Sega of America executive Joe Miller and his team, the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Genesis and made more powerful.  The final design contained two 32-bit [[central processing units]] and a 3D&amp;nbsp;graphics processor.  To bring the new add-on to market by its scheduled release date of November 1994, development of the new system and its games was rushed. The console failed to attract third-party [[video game developer]]s and consumers because of the announcement of the Sega Saturn's simultaneous release in Japan. Sega's efforts to rush the 32X to market cut into available time for game development, resulting in a weak library of forty titles that could not fully use the add-on's hardware, including Genesis [[porting|ports]]. By the end of 1994, the 32X had sold 665,000 units. After price reductions in 1995, it was discontinued in 1996 as Sega turned its focus to the Saturn.

The 32X is considered a [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]]. Reception after the add-on's unveiling and launch was positive, highlighting the low price of the system and power expansion to the Genesis. Later reviews, both contemporary and retrospective, for the 32X have been mostly negative because of its shallow game library, poor market timing and the resulting market fragmentation for the Genesis.

==History==
The [[Sega Genesis]], initially released in Japan as the Mega Drive in 1988, was Sega's entry into the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit era]] of video game consoles.&lt;ref name="RetroinspectionG"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=Imagine Publishing|title=Retroinspection: Mega Drive|author=Sczepaniak, John|issue=27|year=2006|pages=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The console was then released as the Genesis in 1989 for the North American market, with releases in other regions following a year later.&lt;ref name="RetroinspectionG"/&gt;

Although the earlier release of the [[Sega CD]] add-on had been commercially disappointing,&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Retro Gamer|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|title=Retroinspection: Sega 32X|author=McFerran, Damien|issue=77|pages=44–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EurogamerRAF"&gt;{{cite web|last=McFerran|first=Damien|title=The Rise and Fall of Sega Enterprises|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-22-the-rise-and-fall-of-sega-enterprises|publisher=Eurogamer|accessdate=May 1, 2014|date=February 22, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216124431/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-22-the-rise-and-fall-of-sega-enterprises|archivedate=February 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sega began to develop a [[Improvisation|stop-gap]] solution that would bridge the gap between the Genesis and the [[Sega Saturn]], serving as a less expensive entry into the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|32-bit era]].&lt;ref name="32XIGN"&gt;{{cite web|author=Buchanan, Levi|title=32X Follies|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=October 24, 2008|accessdate=May 25, 2013|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/24/32x-follies|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417080118/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/24/32x-follies|archivedate=April 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decision to create a new system was made by Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama and broadly supported by Sega of America employees.  According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama was worried that the Saturn would not be available until after 1994, and about the recent release of the [[64-bit]] [[Atari Jaguar]]. As a result, the direction given was to have this second release to market by the end of the year.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;

===Development===
During the Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in January 1994, Sega of America [[research and development]] head Joe Miller took a phone call in his Las Vegas hotel suite from Nakayama, in which Nakayama stressed the importance of coming up with a quick response to the Jaguar.  Included on this call were Bayless, Sega hardware team head Hideki Sato, and Sega of America vice president of technology Marty Franz.  One potential idea for this came from a concept from Sega of Japan, later known as "Project Jupiter", an entirely new independent console.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;  Project Jupiter was initially slated to be a new version of the Genesis, with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming Saturn, as well as with some limited [[3D computer graphics|3D]] capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the [[Sega Genesis#Sega Virtua Processor|Sega Virtua Processor]] chip.  Miller suggested an alternative strategy, citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web|author=Horowitz, Ken|title=Interview: Joe Miller|publisher=Sega-16|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2013/02/interview-joe-miller/|date=February 7, 2013|accessdate=January 10, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233248/http://www.sega-16.com/2013/02/interview-joe-miller/|archivedate=December 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to former Sega of America producer Michael Latham, Miller said, "Oh, that's just a horrible idea.  If all you're going to do is enhance the system, you should make it an add-on.  If it's a new system with legitimate new software, great.  But if the only thing it does is double the colors...."&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;  Miller, however, insists that the decision was made collectively to talk about alternative solutions.  One idea was to leverage the existing Genesis as a way to keep from alienating Sega customers, who would otherwise be required to discard their Genesis systems entirely to play 32-bit games, and to control the cost of the new system.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;  This would come in the form of an add-on.  From these discussions, Project Jupiter was discontinued and the new add-on, codenamed "Project Mars", was advanced.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;

At the suggestion from Miller and his team, Sega designed the 32X as a peripheral for the existing Genesis, expanding its power with two 32-bit [[SuperH]]-2 processors.&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L. Kent |title=The Ultimate History of Video Games: The Story Behind the Craze that Touched our Lives and Changed the World |year=2001 |publisher=Prima Publishing |isbn=0-7615-3643-4 |chapter=The "Next" Generation (Part 1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SH-2 had been developed in 1993 as a joint venture between Sega and Japanese electronics company [[Hitachi]].&lt;ref name="NG February"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sega Saturn|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|publisher=[[Future plc|Imagine Media]]|date=February 1995|issue=2|volume=1|pages=36–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original design for the 32X add-on, according to Bayless, was created on a cocktail napkin,&lt;ref name="RetroinspectionCD"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Retro Gamer]]&amp;nbsp;— the Mega Drive Book|title=Retroinspection: Mega-CD|pages=18–27|author=McFerran, Damien|publisher=Imagine Publishing|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Miller insists that this was not the case.  At the end of the Consumer Electronics show, with the basic design of the 32X in place, Sega of Japan invited Sega of America to assist in development of the new add-on.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

Although the new unit was a stronger console than originally proposed, it was not compatible with Saturn games.&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt; This was justified by Sega's statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Semrad |first=Ed |title=EGM Goes One-on-One with Sega's Chief - Tom Kalinske|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=65|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=December 1994|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allgame32X" /&gt; Bayless praised the potential of this system at this point, calling it "a coder's dream for the day" with its twin processors and 3D capabilities.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt; Sega of America headed up the development of the 32X, with some assistance from Sato's team at Sega of Japan.  Shortages of processors due to the same 32-bit chips being used in both the 32X and the Saturn hindered the development of the 32X, as did the language barrier between the teams in Japan and the United States.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;

Before the 32X could be launched, the release date of the Saturn was announced for November 1994 in Japan, coinciding with the 32X's target launch date in North America.  Sega of America now was faced with trying to market the 32X with the Saturn's Japan release occurring simultaneously.  Their answer was to call the 32X a "transitional device" between the Genesis and the Saturn, to which Bayless describes of the strategy, "[f]rankly, it just made us look greedy and dumb to consumers."&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;

===Pre-launch promotion, release, and marketing===
[[Image:Sega-Saturn-JP-Mk1-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese Sega Saturn, released in November 1994.  The 32X was incompatible with Saturn software.]]
The unveiling of the 32X to the public came at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in June 1994 in Chicago.  Promoted as the "poor man's entry into 'next generation' games", 32X was marketed for its [[United States dollar|US$]]159 price point as a less-expensive alternative to the Saturn.  However, Sega would not answer whether or not a Genesis console equipped with a Sega CD and a 32X would be able to run Saturn software.  Founder of [[The 3DO Company]], [[Trip Hawkins]], was willing to point out that it would not, stating, "Everyone knows that 32X is a [[Band-Aid]].  It's not a 'next generation system.'  It's fairly expensive.  It's not particularly high-performance.  It's hard to program for, and it's not compatible with the Saturn."&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;  In response to these comments, Sega executive Richard Brudvik-Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis titles, and had the same system architecture as the Saturn.&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;

In August of that year, ''[[GamePro]]'' highlighted the advantages of the upcoming add-on in its 32-bit processors and significantly lower price, noting that "[n]o doubt gotta-get-it-now gamers will spend the big bucks to grab Saturn or [[PlayStation]] systems and games from Japan.  For the rest of us, however, 32X may well be the system of choice in '94."&lt;ref name="GP32X"&gt;{{cite journal|author="The Whizz"|title=32X: On the Upgrade Path|journal=[[GamePro]]|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|page=30|date=August 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In promotion for the new system, Sega promised 12 games available at launch and 50 games due for release in 1995 from third-party developers.&lt;ref name="GP32X"/&gt;

The 32X was released on November 21, 1994, in North America, in time for the [[Christmas holiday season|holiday season]] that year.&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;  As announced, it retailed for $159.99, and had a reasonably successful launch in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;  Demand among retailers was high, and Sega could not keep up orders for the system.&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;  Over 1,000,000 orders had been placed for 32X units, but Sega had only managed to ship 600,000 units by January 1995.&lt;ref name="Allgame32X" /&gt;  Launching at about the same price as a Genesis console, the price of the 32X was less than half of what the Saturn's price would be at launch.&lt;ref name="32XIGN" /&gt; Despite Sega's initial promises, only six titles were available at its North American launch, including ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Star Wars Arcade]]'', ''[[Virtua Racing|Virtua Racing Deluxe]]'', and ''[[Cosmic Carnage]]''. Although ''Virtua Racing'' was considered a "strong" title, ''Cosmic Carnage'' "looked and played so poorly that reporters made jokes about it."&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wire"&gt;{{cite web|author=McConville, James A.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sega+32X+upgrade+sees+a+sold-out+Yule.-a016020605|title=Sega 32X upgrade sees a sold-out Yule|date=January 2, 1995|accessdate=February 11, 2014|publisher=[[Business Wire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Games were available at a retail price of $69.95.&lt;ref name="GP32X" /&gt;  Advertising for the system included images of the 32X being connected to a Genesis console to create an "[[Arcade game|arcade]] system".  Japan received the 32X on December 3, 1994, at a cost of [[Japanese yen|JP¥]]16,800.&lt;ref name="jp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Super 32X|url=https://sega.jp/fb/segahard/32x/|publisher=[[Sega|Sega Corporation]]|accessdate=February 23, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716105656/http://sega.jp/fb/segahard/32x/|archivedate=July 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system's PAL release came in January 1995, at a price of [[Pound sterling|GB£]]169.99, and also experienced initial high demand.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;

===Decline===
Despite the lower price console's positioning as an inexpensive entry into 32-bit gaming, Sega had a difficult time convincing [[third-party developer]]s to create games for the new system.  Top developers were already aware of the coming arrival of the Sega Saturn, [[Nintendo 64]], and PlayStation, and did not believe the 32X would be capable of competing with any of those systems.&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt; The quick development time of the 32X also made game development difficult, according to Franz.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;  Not wanting to create games for an add-on that was "a technological dead-end", many developers decided not to make games for the system.&lt;ref name="GamesRadar+" /&gt;  Issues also plagued titles developed in-house due to the time crunch to release the 32X.  According to Bayless, "games in the queue were effectively jammed into a box as fast as possible, which meant massive cutting of corners in every conceivable way.  Even from the outset, designs of those games were deliberately conservative because of the time crunch.  By the time they shipped they were even more conservative; they did nothing to show off what the hardware was capable of."&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;

Journalists were similarly concerned about Sega's tactic of selling two similar consoles at different prices and attempting to support both, likening Sega's approach to that of [[General Motors]] and segmenting the market for its consoles.&lt;ref name="FinWorld"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morris, Kathleen|title=Nightmare in the Fun House|journal=[[Financial World]]|date=February 21, 1995|volume=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to convince the press that the 32X was a worthwhile console, Sega flew in journalists from all around the country to [[San Francisco]] for a party at a local nightclub. The event featured a speech from Tom Kalinske, live music with a local rapper praising the 32X, and 32X games on exhibition. However, the event turned out to be a bust, as journalists attempted to leave the party due to its loud music and unimpressive games on display, only to find that the buses that brought them to the nightclub had just left and would not return until the scheduled end of the party.&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ultimate History of Video Games|last=Kent|first=Steven|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=495-496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the system had a successful launch, demand soon disappeared. Over the first three months of 1995, several of the 32X's third party publishers, including [[Capcom]] and [[Konami]], cancelled their 32X projects so that they could focus on producing games for the Saturn and PlayStation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=32X Update|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=70 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1995|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 32X failed to catch on with the public, and is considered a [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]].&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;  By 1995, the Genesis had still not proven successful in Japan, where it was known as Mega Drive, and the Saturn was beating the PlayStation, so Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama decided to force Sega of America to focus on the Saturn and cut support for Genesis products, executing a surprise early launch of the Saturn in the early summer of 1995.  Sega was supporting five different consoles before this—Saturn, Genesis, [[Game Gear]], [[Sega Pico|Pico]], and the [[Master System]]—as well as the Sega CD and Sega 32X add-ons.&lt;ref name="KSL"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

===Sega Neptune===
The Sega Neptune was a two-in-one Genesis and 32X console which Sega planned to release in fall 1995, with the retail price planned to be something less than US$200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=CES ProNews Flashes!|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=68 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=March 1995|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sega cancelled the Neptune in October 1995, citing fears that it would dilute their marketing for the Saturn while being priced too close to the Saturn to be a viable competitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=1995: The Calm Before the Storm?|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=13 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=January 1996|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' used the Sega Neptune as an [[April Fools' Day]] prank in its [[EGM April Fools' jokes#2001|April 2001 issue]]. The issue included a small article in which the writers announced that Sega had found a warehouse full of old Sega Neptunes, and were selling them on a website for only $50.&lt;ref name="EGM"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sega's Neptune Finally Surfaces|publisher=EGM Media, LLC.|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|date=April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical aspects and specifications==
[[File:Sega-Genesis-32X-Motherboard-Top.jpg|thumb|Twin [[Hitachi|Hitachi's]] 32-bit SH2 chips power the 32X]]
The 32X can be used only in conjunction with a Genesis system.  It is inserted into the system like a standard game cartridge.  The add-on requires its own separate power supply, a connection cable linking it to the Genesis, and an additional conversion cable for the original model of the Genesis.  As well as playing its own library of cartridges, the 32X is backwards-compatible with Genesis games, and can also be used in conjunction with the Sega CD to play games that use both add-ons.   The 32X also came with a spacer so it would fit properly with the second model of the Genesis; an optional spacer was offered for use with the [[Sega Genesis#First-party models|Sega Genesis CDX]] system, but ultimately never shipped due to risks of [[electric shock]] when the 32X and CDX were connected.&lt;ref name="AllgameCDX"&gt;{{cite web|author=Marriott, Scott Alan|title=Sega Genesis CDX&amp;nbsp;– Overview|publisher=Allgame|accessdate=June 19, 2013|url=http://allgame.com/platform.php?id=17675|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114094412/http://www.allgame.com/platform.php?id=17675|archivedate=November 14, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Installation of the 32X also requires the insertion of two included electromagnetic shield plates into the Genesis' cartridge slot.&lt;ref name="HardwareSpecs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allgame32X"&gt;{{cite web|author=Beuscher, David|title=Sega Genesis 32X&amp;nbsp;— Overview|publisher=[[Allgame]]|accessdate=June 7, 2013|url=http://allgame.com/platform.php?id=35|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114094433/http://www.allgame.com/platform.php?id=35|archivedate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seated on top of a Genesis, the 32X measures {{convert |115|x|210|x|100|mm|in|abbr=on}}.  The 32X contains two Hitachi SH2 32-bit [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] processors with a clock speed of 23 [[hertz|MHz]],&lt;ref name="HardwareSpecs"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sega Genesis 32X instruction manual |year=1994 |publisher=[[Sega|Sega Enterprises, Ltd.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Sega claimed would allow the system to work 40 times faster than a stand-alone Genesis.&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496" /&gt;  Its [[graphics processing unit]] is capable of producing 32,768 colors and rendering 50,000 [[polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]] per second, which provides a noticeable improvement over the polygon rendering of the Genesis.&lt;ref name="HardwareSpecs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allgame32X" /&gt;  The 32X also includes 256 [[kilobytes]] of [[random-access memory]] (RAM), along with 256 kilobytes of [[VRAM|video RAM]].  Sound is supplied through a [[pulse-width modulation]] sound source.  [[Input/output]] is supplied to a television set via a provided [[audiovisual|A/V]] cable that supplies [[composite video]] and [[stereo]] audio, or through an [[RF modulator]]. Stereo audio can also be played through [[headphones]] via a [[Headphone Jack|headphone jack]] on the attached Genesis.&lt;ref name="HardwareSpecs" /&gt;

==Game library==
[[Image:Doom32X.PNG|thumb|right|The 32X version of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]''.]]
{{See also|List of 32X games}}
The 32X's game library consists of forty&amp;nbsp;titles, including six that required both the Sega 32X and Sega CD.  Among the titles for the 32X were ports of arcade games ''[[Space Harrier]]'' and ''Star Wars Arcade'', a [[Side-scrolling video game|sidescroller]] with a [[hummingbird]] as a main character in ''[[Kolibri (video game)|Kolibri]]'', and a 32X-exclusive game in the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'' series]] titled ''[[Knuckles' Chaotix]]''.  Several of the games released for the 32X are enhanced [[Porting|ports]] of Genesis games, including ''[[After Burner]]'', ''[[NFL Quarterback Club]]'', and ''[[World Series Baseball '95]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=World Series Baseball|journal=Next Generation|publisher=Imagine Media|issue=11|volume=1|date=November 1995|page=177|quote=''World Series Baseball '95'' for the 32X isn't much better than its 16-bit counterpart, but it's easily the best baseball game available.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a retrospective review of the console, ''Star Wars Arcade'' was considered the best game for the 32X by [[IGN]] for its cooperative play, soundtrack, and faithful reproduction of the experiences of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.&lt;ref name="32XIGN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNSW"&gt;{{cite web|author=Buchanan, Levi|title=Star Wars Arcade Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=May 24, 2013|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/24/star-wars-arcade-review|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223223304/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/24/star-wars-arcade-review|archivedate=February 23, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate review, IGN's Buchanan praised the 32X title ''[[Shadow Squadron]]'' as superior to ''Star Wars Arcade''.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Levi|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/11/13/shadow-squadron-review|title=''Shadow Squadron'' Review|publisher=IGN|date=November 13, 2008|accessdate=November 14, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127184258/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/11/13/shadow-squadron-review|archivedate=November 27, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' writer Damien McFerran, however, praised ''[[Virtua Fighter (video game)|Virtua Fighter]]'' as "the jewel in the 32X's crown",&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{cite journal|title=Un-X-Pected|journal=Next Generation|publisher=Imagine Media|issue=11|volume=1|date=November 1995|page=177|quote=The 32X version has kept all the moves intact.

We had to get games out for the 32X and it was going to be such a close cycle.  When ''Cosmic Carnage'' showed up, we didn't even want to ship it.  It took a lot of convincing, you know, to ship that title."&lt;ref name="Kent_493_496"/&gt;  Likewise with ''Doom'', [[id Software]]'s John Carmack rushed to have the port ready for release at the 32X's launch and had to trim out a third of the game's levels in order to meet the deadline for the port to be published on time.  Because of time limitations, game designs were intentionally conservative and did not show what the 32X hardware was able to do.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt; In an interview at the end of 1995, Sega vice president of marketing Mike Ribero, while insisting that Sega was not abandoning the 32X, acknowledged that first party software support for the system had been lackluster: "I won't lie to you, we screwed up with 32X. We overpromised and underdelivered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=1996 |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=78|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1996|pages=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
[[Image:Sega-Genesis-Model-2-Monster-Bare.jpg|thumb|right|Sega Genesis with both the 32X and CD add-ons]]
Initial reception to the 32X and its games upon the launch of the add-on was very positive. Four reviewers from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' scored the add-on 8, 7, 8, and 8 out of 10 in their 1995 Buyer's Guide, highlighting the add-on's enhancements to the Genesis but questioning how long the system would be supported.&lt;ref name="egmbuyersguide1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |author2= |date=January 1995  |title=Electronic Gaming Monthly's Buyer's Guide |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= |publisher=EGM Media, LLC. |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' commented that the 32X's multiple input and power cords make it "as complicated as setting up your [[VCR]]" and noted some performance glitches with the prototype such as [[Freeze (computing)|freezes]] and overheating, but expressed confidence that the production models would perform well and gave the add-on their overall approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=The Return of the X|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=66|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1995|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of its launch titles, such as ''Doom'', were likewise positive.&lt;ref name="DREGM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GPDoom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameFan"/&gt; By late 1995, feedback to the add-on had soured. In its 1996 Buyer's Guide, ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'''s four reviewers scored the add-on 3, 3, 3, and 2 out of 10, criticizing the game library and Sega's abandonment of the system in favor of the Saturn.&lt;ref name="egmbuyersguide1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |author2= |date=January 1996  |title=Electronic Gaming Monthly's Buyer's Guide |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url= |publisher=EGM Media, LLC. |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' panned the 32X for its weak polygon processing, the tendency of developers to show off its capabilities with garishly colored games, and its apparent function as "simply a way of grabbing extra 1994 mind and market share while waiting for Saturn". The review gave it one out of five stars.&lt;ref name="NGen12"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Which Game System is the Best!?|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=12|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=December 1995|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrospectively, the 32X is widely criticized as having been under-supported and a poor idea in the wake of the release of the Sega Saturn.  [[1UP.com]]'s Jeremy Parish stated that the 32X "tainted just about everything it touched."&lt;ref name="1UP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/sega-cd-anniversary |title=20 Years Ago, Sega Gave Us the Sega CD |accessdate=December 11, 2016 |author=Parish, Jeremy |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=October 16, 2012 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615202428/http://www.1up.com/features/sega-cd-anniversary |archivedate=June 15, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[GamesRadar+]] also panned the system, placing it as their ninth-worst console with reviewer Mikel Reparaz criticizing that "it was a stopgap system that would be thrown under the bus when the Sega Saturn came out six months later, and everyone seemed to know it except for die-hard Sega fans and the company itself."&lt;ref name="GamesRadar+"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-10-worst-consoles-ever/2/ |title=The 10 worst consoles ever |accessdate=June 7, 2013 |author=Reparaz, Mikel |publisher=[[GamesRadar+]] |date=February 23, 2008 |p=2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211144809/http://www.gamesradar.com/the-10-worst-consoles-ever/2/ |archivedate=February 11, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''&lt;nowiki&gt;Retro Gamer'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''s Damien McFerran offered some praise for the power increase of the 32X to offer ports of ''Space Harrier'', ''After Burner'', and ''Virtua Fighter'' that were accurate to the original arcade versions, as well as the add-on's price point, stating, "If you didn't have deep enough pockets to afford a Saturn, then the 32X was a viable option; it's just a shame that it sold so poorly because the potential was there for true greatness."&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;  Levi Buchanan, writing for IGN, saw some sense in the move for Sega to create the 32X but criticized its implementation.  According to Buchanan, "I actually thought the 32X was a better idea than the SEGA CD... The 32X, while underpowered, at least advanced the ball. Maybe it only gained a few inches in no small part due to a weak library, but at least the idea was the right one."&lt;ref name="32XIGN" /&gt;

In particular, the console's status as an add-on and poor timing after the announcement of the Saturn has been identified by reviewers as being responsible factors for fracturing the audience for Sega's video game consoles in terms of both developers and consumers.  Allgame notes that "[e]very add-on whittled away at the number of potential buyers and discouraged third-party companies from making the games necessary to boost sales."&lt;ref name="AllgameCD32X"&gt;{{cite web|author=Marriott, Scott Alan|title=Sega Genesis CD 32X&amp;nbsp;— Overview|publisher=Allgame|accessdate=June 7, 2013|url=http://allgame.com/platform.php?id=43|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210111102/http://www.allgame.com/platform.php?id=43|archivedate=December 10, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''GamePro'' criticized the concept of the add-on, noting the expenses involved in purchasing the system.  According to reviewer Blake Snow, "Just how many 16-bit attachments did one need? All in all, if you were one of the unlucky souls who completely bought into Sega's add-on frenzy, you would have spent a whopping $650 for something that weighed about as much as a small dog."&lt;ref name="gamepro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/111823.shtml |title=The 10 Worst-Selling Consoles of All Time |accessdate=November 25, 2007 |author=Snow, Blake |publisher=''[[GamePro]]'' |date=May 4, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508035815/http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/111823.shtml|archivedate=May 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing for GamesRadar+, Reparaz noted that "developers—not wanting to waste time on a technological dead-end—abandoned the 32X in droves. Gamers quickly followed suit, turning what was once a promising idea into an embarrassing footnote in console history, as well as an object lesson in why console makers shouldn't split their user base with pricey add-ons."&lt;ref name="GamesRadar+" /&gt;  Reparaz went on to criticize Sega's decision to release the 32X, noting that "(u)ltimately, the 32X was the product of boneheaded short-sightedness: its existence put Sega into competition with itself once the Saturn rolled out."&lt;ref name="GamesRadar+" /&gt;  Writing for IGN, Buchanan also notes that "Notice that we haven't seen many add-ons like the 32X since 1994? I think the 32X killed the idea of an add-on like this—a power booster—permanently. And that's a good thing. Because add-ons, if not implemented properly, just splinter an audience."&lt;ref name="32XIGN" /&gt;

Former executives at Sega have mixed opinions of the 32X.  Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves as a warning to the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the [[Kinect]] and [[PlayStation Move]] for doing so.&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;  Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on.  An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device."&lt;ref name="Retroinspection"/&gt;  Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons."&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

'''A-not-B error''' (also known as "stage 4 error" or "perseverative error") is a phenomenon uncovered by the work of [[Jean Piaget]] in his [[theory of cognitive development]] of children. The A-not-B error is a particular error made by infants during substage 4 of their [[sensorimotor stage]]. 

A typical A-not-B task goes like this: An experimenter hides an attractive toy under box "A" within the baby's reach. The baby searches for the toy, looks under box "A", and finds the toy. This activity is usually repeated several times (always with the researcher hiding the toy under box "A"). Then, in the critical trial, the experimenter moves the toy under box "B", also within easy reach of the baby. Babies of 10 months or younger typically make the [[perseveration]] error, meaning they look under box "A" even though they saw the researcher move the toy under box "B", and box "B" is just as easy to reach. This demonstrates a lack of, or incomplete, [[schema (psychology)|schema]] of [[object permanence]]. Children of 12 months or older typically do not make this error.

==Competing explanations==
Traditionally, this phenomenon has been explained as the child seeing an image and remembering where it was, rather than where it is. Other accounts deal with the development of planning, reaching, and deciding things. There are also [[behaviorist]] accounts that explain the behavior in terms of reinforcement. This account argues that the repeated trials with hiding the toy in box "A" is reinforcing that specific behavior, so that the child still reaches for box "A" because the action has been reinforced before. However, this account does not explain the shift in behavior that occurs around 12 months.

Smith and Thelen&lt;ref name=ST&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00156-6|pmid=12907229|title=Development as a dynamic system|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=7|issue=8|pages=343–348|year=2003|last1=Smith|first1=Linda B.|last2=Thelen|first2=Esther}}&lt;/ref&gt; used a [[Cognitive model#Cognitive development| dynamic systems]] approach to the A-not-B task. They found that various components of the activity (strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time, stance) combine in the "B"-trial (where the object is hidden in the "B" location rather than "A") so the child either correctly or incorrectly searches for the toy. They experimentally manipulated the task to see if they could make 10-month-old babies (who typically make the perseverative error of searching at "A") perform like 12-month-old babies (who typically search correctly). Changing the stance of the baby (sitting or standing) was one manipulation they found could make the 10-month-old search correctly. Just standing instead of sitting for the "B"-trial made the prior experience of searching in location "A" less salient to the child, who then searched correctly. The researchers concluded that the length of wait time was one of the crucial elements of the task that is influenced by age.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1127">An '''algorithmic paradigm''', '''algorithm design paradigm''', '''algorithmic technique''', or '''algorithmic strategy''' is a generic method or approach which underlies the design of a class of [[algorithm]]s. It is an abstraction higher than the notion of an algorithm, just as an algorithm is an abstraction higher than a [[computer program]].  &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=M2viBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA702 p. 702]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=McPJt_eBgnoC&amp;pg=SA1-PA9 p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of algorithmic paradigms include the [[greedy algorithm]]  in [[optimization problem]]s,  [[dynamic programming]], [[prune and search]], and [[divide and conquer algorithms]]. More specialized algorithmic paradigms used in [[parameterized complexity]] include [[kernelization]] and [[iterative compression]]. In [[computational geometry]], additional algorithmic paradigms include [[sweep line algorithm]]s, [[rotating calipers]], and [[Randomized algorithm#Randomized incremental constructions in geometry|randomized incremental construction]].

[[File:Charity gift cards for good little Yahoos (3119024104).jpg|thumb|A charity gift card, describing its donation as an alternative to a "sweater you'd never wear"]]
'''Alternative giving''' is a form of [[gift|gift giving]] in which the giver makes a [[donation]] to a [[charitable organization]] on the gift recipient’s behalf, rather than giving them an item. The idea of giving something to one person by paying another was applied by [[Benjamin Franklin]] as a "trick [...] for doing a deal of good with a little money", which came to be known as "[[pay it forward]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Franklin to Benjamin Webb|Benjamin Franklin to Benjamin Webb, April 22d, 1784]]&lt;/ref&gt; This form of giving is often used as an alternative to [[consumerism]] and to mitigate the impact of gift-giving on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newdream.org/holiday/simplify.pdf|title=Simplify the Holidays|publisher=[[Center for a New American Dream]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charities that promote this type of donating will normally provide a card or certificate describing the donation, often with an example of how the donation will be used (such as one day’s worth of food for a hungry person) or a symbolic denomination, called "ownership" or "adoption" (of an animal or a tree for example). Some charities promote alternative giving at weddings in place of [[wedding favors]], normally providing several cards to be left on tables at the reception letting guests know a donation has been made rather than individual cards for each guest. Kate Middleton and Prince William made the decision to "Pay it Forward" with their wedding gifts, asking that the money to be used for gifts be given to charities and good causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/16/royal-wedding-charity-gifts_n_836429.html|title=Prince William &amp; Kate Middleton Ask For Charitable Royal Wedding Gifts, Not Presents|date=16 March 2011|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pop culture references==
The concept was [[satire|spoofed]] in the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode [[The Strike (Seinfeld episode)|"The Strike"]]. [[George Costanza]], angry at having received a donation to charity instead of an actual gift, made up his own non-existent charity and handed out fake donations to save money on gifts and cheques.

Comedian [[Ricky Gervais]] poked fun at the concept during a stand-up routine in which he recounts the time when his friends gave a goat to an African family in Gervais' name. Gervais considers this to be a lose-lose situation for all involved: he gets nothing, his friends spent a considerable amount of money on the alternative gift, the African family would not likely appreciate having "another mouth to feed," and the goat being taken away from its natural environment to an unfamiliar place unsuited for it.

Too many such arguments have proved too painfully wrong. Authorities must prove their contentions like everybody else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sagan|first1=Carl|title=The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yz8Y6KfXf9UC&amp;q=Arguments+from+authority#v=snippet&amp;q=Arguments%20from%20authority&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]
|date=July 6, 2011 |isbn=9780307801043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An example of the use of the appeal to authority in science can be seen in 1923, when leading American zoologist [[Theophilus Painter]] declared, based on poor data and conflicting observations he had made,&lt;ref name ="Painter_Account" /&gt;&lt;ref name="48_taught"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mertens|first1=Thomas|title=The Role of Factual Knowledge in Biology Teaching|journal=[[The American Biology Teacher]]|date=October 1979|volume=41|issue=7|doi=10.2307/4446671|url=http://abt.ucpress.edu/content/41/7/395|pages=395–419|jstor=4446671}}&lt;/ref&gt; that humans had 24 pairs of [[chromosomes]]. From the 1920s to the 1950s, this continued to be held based on Painter's authority,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= O'Connor|first= Clare|year= 2008|title= Human Chromosome Number|publisher= Nature|url= http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/Human-Chromosome-Number-294|accessdate= April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gartler|first1=Stanley|title=The Chromosome Number in Humans: A Brief History|journal=[[Nature Reviews Genetics]]|date=2006|volume=7|issue=8|pages=655–60|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/The-chromosome-number-in-humans-a-brief-15575|doi=10.1038/nrg1917|pmid=16847465}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="48_taught" /&gt; despite subsequent counts totaling the [[Chromosome#Human chromosomes|correct number]] of 23.&lt;ref name="Painter_Account"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glass|first1=Bentley|title=Theophilus Shickel Painter|date=1990|publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|location=Washington, DC|pages=316–17|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/painter-theophilus-shickel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orrell_2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orrell|first1=David PhD.|title=The Future of Everything: The Science of Prediction|date=2008|pages=184–85|title-link=Apollo's Arrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even textbooks&lt;ref name="Painter_Account" /&gt; with photos showing 23 pairs incorrectly declared the number to be 24&lt;ref name="Orrell_2008"/&gt; based on the authority of the then-consensus of 24 pairs.&lt;ref name="Down_Binder"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kevles|first1=Daniel J.|title=Human Chromosomes--Down's Disorder and the Binder's Mistakes|journal=Engineering and Science|date=1985|page=9|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/594/2/Kevles.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This seemingly established number created [[confirmation bias]] among researchers, and "most cytologists, expecting to detect Painter's number, virtually always did so".&lt;ref name ="Down_Binder"/&gt; Painter's "influence was so great that many scientists preferred to believe his count over the actual evidence",&lt;ref name="Orrell_2008"/&gt; and scientists who obtained the accurate number modified&lt;ref name="Hsudo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=T. C.|first1=Hsu|title=Out of the Dark Ages: Human and Mammalian Cytogenetics: An Historical Perspective|journal=Cell|date=1979|url=http://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/0092-8674%2879%2990249-6.pdf|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(79)90249-6|volume=18|issue=4|pages=1375–1376}}&lt;/ref&gt; or discarded&lt;ref name="Liver"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Unger|first1=Lawrence|last2=Blystone|first2=Robert|title=Paradigm Lost: The Human Chromosome Story|journal=[[Bioscene]]|date=1996|url=http://amcbt.indstate.edu/volume_22/v22-2p3-9.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; their data to agree with Painter's count.

A more recent example involved the "[[When contact changes minds|When contact changes minds: An experiment on transmission of support for gay equality]]" paper. The paper was a fraud based on forged data, yet concerns about it were ignored in many cases due to appeals to authority. One analysis of the affair notes that "Over and over again, throughout the scientific community and the media, LaCour’s impossible-seeming results were treated as truth, in part because of the weight [the study's co-author] [[Donald Green|Green]]’s name carried".&lt;ref name="Gay Marriage Fraud"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|title=The Case of the Amazing Gay-Marriage Data: How a Graduate Student Reluctantly Uncovered a Huge Scientific Fraud|url=https://www.thecut.com/2015/05/how-a-grad-student-uncovered-a-huge-fraud.html|publisher=The Cut|date=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One psychologist stated his reaction to the paper was "that’s very surprising and doesn’t fit with a huge literature of evidence. It doesn’t sound plausible to me... [then I pull it up and] I see [[Donald Green|Don Green]] is an author. I trust him completely, so I’m no longer doubtful". The forger, LaCour, would use appeals to authority to defend his research: "if his responses sometimes seemed to lack depth when he was pressed for details, his impressive connections often allayed concerns", with one of his partners stating "when he and I really had a disagreement, he would often rely on the kind of arguments where he’d basically invoke authority, right? He’s the one with advanced training, and his adviser is this very high-powered, very experienced person...and they know a lot more than we do".&lt;ref name="Gay Marriage Fraud"/&gt;

Much like the erroneous chromosome number taking decades to refute until microscopy made the error unmistakable, the one who would go on to debunk this paper "was consistently told by friends and advisers to keep quiet about his concerns lest he earn a reputation as a troublemaker", up until "the very last moment when multiple 'smoking guns' finally appeared", and he found that "There was almost no encouragement for him to probe the hints of weirdness he’d uncovered".&lt;ref name="Gay Marriage Fraud"/&gt;

=== {{anchor|False authority}} Appeal to non-authorities ===

Fallacious arguments from [[authority]] are also frequently the result of citing a non-authority as an authority.&lt;ref name="skepdic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/authorty.html|title=Appeal to Authority|ref=skepdic|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert|website=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the fallacy of appealing to an authority in an unrelated field would be citing [[Albert Einstein]] as an authority for a determination on religion when his primary expertise was in [[physics]].&lt;ref name="skepdic" /&gt; The body of attributed authorities might not even welcome their citation, such as with the "More Doctors Smoke [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]]s" ad campaign.&lt;ref&gt;https://csts.ua.edu/files/2016/09/1983-When-More-Doctors-Smoked-Camels-Cigarette-advertising-in-the-Journal-NYSJM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a fallacious ''[[ad hominem]]'' argument to argue that a person presenting statements lacks authority and thus their arguments do not need to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williamson|first1=Owen|title=Master List of Logical Fallacies|url=http://utminers.utep.edu/omwilliamson/ENGL1311/fallacies.htm|publisher=[[The University of Texas at El Paso]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As appeals to a perceived lack of authority, these types of argument are fallacious for much the same reasons as an appeal to authority.

Other related fallacious arguments assume that a person without status or authority is inherently reliable. For instance, the [[appeal to poverty]] is the fallacy of thinking that someone is more likely to be correct because they are poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruggiero|first1=Tim|title=Logical Fallacies|url=http://www.philosophicalsociety.com/Logical%20Fallacies.htm#argumentum%20ad%20lazarum%20--%20The%20fallacy%20of%20supposing%20a%20conclusion%20is%20valid%20because%20the%20argument%20is%20made%20by%20a%20poor%20person.%20It%20is%20the%20opposite%20of%20the%20ad%20crumenam%20fallacy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an argument holds that a conclusion is likely to be true precisely because the one who holds or is presenting it lacks authority, it is a fallacious ''appeal to the common man''.&lt;ref name="Common_man_ref"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bennett|first1=B.|title=Appeal to the Common Man|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/24-appeal-to-common-folk|website=Logically Fallacious}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cognitive bias ==
The argument from authority is based on the idea that a perceived authority must know better and that the person should conform to their opinion. This has its roots in psychological [[cognitive biases]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.1057/9780230297616_5|chapter = Social Influence: Modes and Modalities|title = The Social Psychology of Communication|pages = 87–106|year = 2011|last1 = Sammut|first1 = Gordon|last2 = Bauer|first2 = Martin W|isbn = 978-0-230-24736-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Asch effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delameter|first1=Andrew|title=Contrasting Scientific &amp; Non-Scientific Approaches to Acquiring Knowledge|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Xu_Mcci-vPsJ:academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/psych/delam/53.1/Lecture1.pptx+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us|agency=City University of New York|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheldon|first1=Brian|last2=Macdonald|first2=Geraldine|title=A Textbook of Social Work|date=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dt6NAgAAQBAJ|publisher=Routledge|page=40|isbn=9781135282615}}&lt;/ref&gt; In repeated and modified instances of the [[Asch conformity experiments]], it was found that high-status individuals create a stronger likelihood of a subject agreeing with an obviously false conclusion, despite the subject normally being able to clearly see that the answer was incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= McLeod| first= Samuel| year= 2008| title= Asch Experiment| publisher= Simply Psychology|url= http://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, humans have been shown to feel strong emotional pressure to conform to authorities and majority positions. A repeat of the experiments by another group of researchers found that "Participants reported considerable [[Stress (psychological)|distress]] under the group pressure", with 59% conforming at least once and agreeing with the clearly incorrect answer, whereas the incorrect answer was much more rarely given when no such pressures were present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Webley| first= Paul| title= A partial and non-evaluative history of the Asch effect| publisher=[[University of Exeter]]|url= http://people.exeter.ac.uk/PWebley/psy1002/asch.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study shining light on the psychological basis of the fallacy as it relates to perceived authorities are the [[Milgram experiments]], which demonstrated that people are more likely to go along with something when it is presented by an authority.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Milgram | first1 = S | year = 1965 | title = Some conditions of obedience and disobedience to authority | url = | journal = Human Relations | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 57–76 | doi=10.1177/001872676501800105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a variation of a study where the researchers did not wear a lab coat, thus reducing the perceived authority of the tasker, the obedience level dropped to 20% from the original rate, which had been higher than 50%. Obedience is encouraged by reminding the individual of what a perceived authority states and by showing them that their opinion goes against this authority.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Scholars have noted that certain environments can produce an ideal situation for these processes to take hold, giving rise to [[groupthink]].&lt;ref&gt;https://disruptedphysician.com/2014/12/page/2/&lt;/ref&gt; In groupthink, individuals in a group feel inclined to minimize conflict and encourage conformity. Through an appeal to authority, a group member might present that opinion as a consensus and encourage the other group members to engage in groupthink by not disagreeing with this perceived consensus or authority.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of GROUPTHINK.

The '''astronomical system of units''', formally called the '''IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants''',{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;!--the reference does not say that the IAU system is a formal name of the common name "astronomical system of units"--&gt; is a [[Systems of measurement|system of measurement]] developed for use in [[astronomy]]. It was adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) in 1976,&lt;ref name="IAU76"&gt;Resolution No. 10 of the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1976_French.pdf XVIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Grenoble, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been significantly updated in 1994 and 2009 (see [[astronomical constant]]).

The system was developed because of the difficulties in measuring and expressing astronomical data in [[International System of Units]] ([[SI unit]]s). In particular, there is a huge quantity of very precise data relating to the positions of objects within the [[Solar System]] which cannot conveniently be expressed or processed in SI units. Through a number of modifications, the astronomical system of units now explicitly recognizes the consequences of [[general relativity]], which is a necessary addition to the [[International System of Units]] in order to accurately treat astronomical data.

The astronomical system of units is a [[Dimensional analysis|tridimensional]] system, in that it defines units of [[length]], [[mass]] and [[time]]. The associated [[astronomical constant]]s also fix the different [[Frame of reference|frames of reference]] that are needed to report observations.&lt;ref name=Systems&gt;

In particular, there is the ''barycentric celestial reference system'' (BCRS) centered at the [[barycenter]] of the Solar System, and the ''geocentric celestial reference system'' (GCRS) centered at the center of mass of the Earth (including its fluid envelopes) {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7NdrK4e77CIC&amp;pg=PA105 |author=Dennis D. McCarthy, P. Kenneth Seidelmann |title=	Time: from Earth rotation to atomic physics|chapter=Resolution B1.3: Definition of the barycentric celestial reference system and geocentric celestial reference system  ''XXIVth International Astronomical Union General Assembly (2000)'' |page=105 |isbn=3-527-40780-4 |date=2009 |publisher=[[Wiley-VCH]]}}

&lt;/ref&gt; The system is a conventional system, in that neither the unit of length nor the unit of mass are true [[physical constant]]s, and there are at least three different measures of time.

== Astronomical unit of time ==
{{Main|Day}}
The astronomical unit of time is the [[Day]], defined as {{val|86400}} [[second]]s. 365.25 days make up one [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]].&lt;ref name="IAU76" /&gt; The symbol ''D'' is used in astronomy to refer to this unit.

== Astronomical unit of mass ==
{{Main|Solar mass}}
The astronomical unit of mass is the [[solar mass]].&lt;ref name="IAU76" /&gt; The symbol {{Solar mass}} is often used to refer to this unit.
The solar mass ({{Solar mass}}), {{val|1.98892|e=30|ul=kg}}, is a standard way to express [[mass]] in [[astronomy]], used to describe the masses of other [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]].  It is equal to the mass of the [[Sun]], about {{val|333000}} times the mass of the [[Earth]] or 1 048 times the mass of [[Jupiter]].

In practice, the masses of celestial bodies appear in the dynamics of the Solar System only through the products ''GM'', where ''G'' is the constant of gravitation. In the past, ''GM'' of the Sun could be determined experimentally with only limited accuracy. Its present accepted value is&lt;ref name=IERS&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; {{nowrap|''G'' {{Solar mass}}&lt;nowiki&gt;=1.327 124 420 99&lt;/nowiki&gt; × 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;±10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;  m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}}

===Jupiter mass===

{{main|Jupiter mass}}
Jupiter mass ({{Jupiter mass}} or ''M''&lt;sub&gt;JUP&lt;/sub&gt;), is the unit of [[mass]] equal to the total mass of the planet [[Jupiter]], {{val|1.898|e=27|ul=kg}}. Jupiter mass is used to describe masses of the [[gas giant]]s, such as the [[outer planet]]s and [[extrasolar planet]]s. It is also used in describing [[brown dwarfs]] and Neptune-mass planets.

===Earth mass===

{{Main|Earth mass}}
Earth mass ({{Earth mass}}) is the unit of [[mass]] equal to that of the [[Earth]]. 1 {{Earth mass}} = {{val|5.9742|e=24|ul=kg}}. Earth mass is often used to describe masses of rocky [[terrestrial planet]]s. It is also used to describe Neptune-mass planets. One Earth mass is {{val|0.00315}} times a Jupiter mass.

==Astronomical unit of length==
{{Main|Astronomical unit}}
The astronomical unit of length is now defined as exactly 149 597 870 700 meters.&lt;ref name="IAUresB2"&gt;{{citation |contribution=RESOLUTION B2 on the re-definition of the astronomical unit of length |title=RESOLUTION B2 | editor-last = International Astronomical Union |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] |place=Beijing, China |date=31 August 2012 | contribution-url = http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU2012_English.pdf |quote=The XXVIII General Assembly of International Astronomical Union … recommends … 1. that the astronomical unit be re-defined to be a conventional unit of length equal to 149 597 870 700 m exactly}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is approximately equal to the mean Earth–Sun distance. It was formerly defined as that length for which the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] (''k'') takes the value {{val|0.01720209895}} when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time.&lt;ref name="IAU76" /&gt; The dimensions of ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are those of the [[constant of gravitation]] (''G''), i.e., L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The term “unit distance” is also used for the length ''A'' while, in general usage, it is usually referred to simply as the “astronomical unit”, symbol au.

An equivalent formulation of the old definition of the astronomical unit is the radius of an unperturbed circular Newtonian orbit about the Sun of a particle having infinitesimal mass, moving with a mean motion of {{val|0.01720209895}} radians per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|page=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[speed of light]] in IAU is the defined value ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|299792458|u=m/s}} of the SI units. In terms of this speed, the old definition of the astronomical unit of length had the  accepted value:&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt; 1&amp;nbsp;ua&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;tau;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|1.49597870700|e=11}}&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;m, where τ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the transit time of light across the astronomical unit. The astronomical unit of length was determined by the condition that the measured data in the [[ephemeris]] match observations, and that in turn decides the transit time τ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Other units for astronomical distances ===

|}

The distances to distant galaxies are typically not quoted in distance units at all, but rather in terms of [[redshift]].  The reasons for this are that converting redshift to distance requires knowledge of the [[Hubble constant]] which was not accurately measured until the early 21st century, and that at cosmological distances, the curvature of [[space-time]] allows one to come up with multiple definitions for distance.  For example, the distance as defined by the amount of time it takes for a light beam to travel to an observer is different from the distance as defined by the apparent size of an object.

'''Aung San Suu Kyi''' ({{IPAc-en|aʊ|ŋ|ˌ|s|æ|n|.|s|uː|ˈ|tʃ|iː}}; {{MYname|MY=အောင်ဆန်းစုကြည်|MLCTS=aung hcan: cu. krany}} {{IPA-my|àʊɴ sʰáɴ sṵ tɕì}}; born 19 June 1945) is a [[Myanmar|Burmese]] politician, diplomat, author, and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate (1991). She is the leader of the [[National League for Democracy]] and the first and incumbent [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|State Counsellor]], a position akin to a prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41139319|title=Johnson warns Suu Kyi over Rohingya|date=3 September 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also the [[List of female foreign ministers|first woman]] to serve as Minister for [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Myanmar)|Foreign Affairs]], for the [[Office of the President of Myanmar|President's Office]], for Electric Power and Energy, and for [[Ministry of Education (Myanmar)|Education]]. From 2012 to 2016 she was an [[member of parliament|MP]] for [[Kawhmu Township]] to the [[House of Representatives (Myanmar)|House of Representatives]].

The youngest daughter of [[Aung San]], [[Father of the Nation]] of modern-day Myanmar, and [[Khin Kyi]], Aung San Suu Kyi was born in [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]]. After graduating from the [[University of Delhi]] in 1964 and the [[University of Oxford]] in 1968, she worked at the [[United Nations]] for three years. She married [[Michael Aris]] in 1972, with whom she had two children. Aung San Suu Kyi rose to prominence in the [[8888 Uprising|1988 Uprisings]], and became the General Secretary of the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD), which she had newly formed with the help of several retired army officials who criticized the military junta. In the [[Burmese general election, 1990|1990 elections]], NLD won 81% of the seats in Parliament, but the results were nullified, as the [[State Peace and Development Council|military]] refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. She had, however, already been detained under [[house arrest]] before the elections. She remained under house arrest for almost 15 of the 21 years from 1989 to 2010, becoming one of the world's most prominent [[political prisoner]]s.

Her party boycotted the [[Myanmar general election, 2010|2010 elections]], resulting in a decisive victory for the military-backed [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]]. Aung San Suu Kyi became a [[Pyithu Hluttaw]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] while her party won 43 of the 45 vacant seats in the [[Burmese by-elections, 2012|2012 by-elections]]. In the [[Myanmar general election, 2015|2015 elections]], her party won a [[landslide victory]], taking 86% of the seats in the [[Assembly of the Union]] – well more than the 67 percent [[supermajority]] needed to ensure that its preferred candidates were elected [[President of Myanmar|President]] and [[Vice President of Myanmar|Second Vice President]] in the [[Presidential Electoral College]]. Although she was prohibited from becoming the President due to a clause in [[Constitution of Myanmar|the constitution]] – her late husband and children are foreign citizens – she assumed the newly created role of [[State Counsellor of Myanmar|State Counsellor]], a role akin to a [[Prime Minister of Myanmar|Prime Minister]] or a [[head of government]].

[[File:Khin Kyi and family.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A portrait of Khin Kyi and her family in 1948. Aung San Suu Kyi is seated on the floor.]]
Aung San Suu Kyi was born on 19 June 1945 in Rangoon (now [[Yangon]]), British Burma. According to Peter Popham, she was born in a small village outside Rangoon called Hmway Saung.&lt;ref name="Popham"&gt;{{cite book |last=Popham |first=Peter |date=April 2013 |title=The Lady and the Peacock: The Life of Aung San Suu Kyi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yCL1drLmsmQC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;q=%22hmway%20saung%22 |location=New York, NY |publisher=The Experiment, LLC |page=163 |isbn=978-1-61519-081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, [[Aung San]], founded the [[Tatmadaw|modern Burmese army]] and negotiated Burma's independence from the [[British Empire]] in 1947; he was [[Burmese Martyrs' Day|assassinated by his rivals]] in the same year. She grew up with her mother, [[Khin Kyi]], and two brothers, Aung San Lin and [[Aung San Oo]], in Rangoon. Aung San Lin died at the age of eight, when he drowned in an ornamental lake on the grounds of [[Bogyoke Aung San Museum|the house]].&lt;ref name="Nobel.org" /&gt; Her elder brother emigrated to [[San Diego]], California, becoming a [[Citizenship in the United States|United States citizen]].&lt;ref name="Nobel.org" /&gt; After Aung San Lin's death, the family moved to [[54 University Avenue|a house]] by [[Inya Lake]] where Aung San Suu Kyi met people of various backgrounds, political views and religions.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart (1997), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated in [[Basic Education High School No. 1 Dagon|Methodist English High School]] (now Basic Education High School No. 1 Dagon) for much of her childhood in Burma, where she was noted as having a talent for learning languages.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart (1997), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; She speaks four languages: Burmese, English, French and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Aung San Suu Kyi: A Biography, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; She is a [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhist]].

Suu Kyi's mother, [[Khin Kyi]], gained prominence as a political figure in the newly formed Burmese government. She was appointed Burmese ambassador to [[India]] and [[Nepal]] in 1960, and Aung San Suu Kyi followed her there.

In 1988, Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma, at first to tend for her ailing mother but later to lead the pro-democracy movement. Aris' visit in Christmas 1995 turned out to be the last time that he and Aung San Suu Kyi met, as Aung San Suu Kyi remained in Burma and the Burmese dictatorship denied him any further entry visas.&lt;ref name = "azjarp" /&gt; Aris was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]] in 1997 which was later found to be [[terminal illness|terminal]]. Despite appeals from prominent figures and organizations, including the United States, UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] and [[Pope John Paul II]], the Burmese government would not grant Aris a [[visa (document)|visa]], saying that they did not have the facilities to care for him, and instead urged Aung San Suu Kyi to leave the country to visit him. She was at that time temporarily free from [[house arrest]] but was unwilling to depart, fearing that she would be refused re-entry if she left, as she did not trust the [[military junta]]'s assurance that she could return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/304497.stm Suu Kyi rejects UK visit offer].

==Political career==

===Political beginning===
Coincidentally, when Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma in 1988, the long-time military leader of Burma and head of the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party|ruling party]], General [[Ne Win]], stepped down. Mass demonstrations for democracy followed that event on 8 August 1988 (8–8–88, a day seen as auspicious), which were violently suppressed in what came to be known as the [[8888 Uprising]]. On 26 August 1988, she addressed half a million people at a mass rally in front of the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] in the capital, calling for a democratic government.&lt;ref name="azjarp" /&gt; However, in September, a [[State Peace and Development Council|new military junta]] took power.

Offered freedom if she left the country, she refused. Despite her philosophy of non-violence, a group of ex-military commanders and senior politicians who joined NLD during the crisis believed that she was too confrontational and left NLD. However, she retained enormous popularity and support among NLD youths with whom she spent most of her time.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite journal | title=Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar: A Review of the Lady's Biographies | author=Kyaw Yin Hlaing | journal=Contemporary Southeast Asia: A Journal of International &amp; Strategic Affairs |date=August 2007  | volume=29 | issue=2 | page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her time under house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi devoted herself to Buddhist meditation practices and to studying Buddhist thought. This deeper interest in Buddhism is reflected in her writings as more emphasis is put on love and compassion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Voice of Hope: Conversations with Alan Clements | author=Aung San Suu Kyi | publisher=Seven Stories Press | year=1998 | page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; There also emerged more discussion on the compatibility of democracy and Buddhism and the ability of gaining freedom from an authoritarian government through Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Buddhist Political Rhetoric of Aung San Suu Kyi | author=Stephen McCarthy | journal=Contemporary Buddhism |year=2004 | volume=5 | page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the crisis, the previous democratically elected Prime Minister of Burma, [[U Nu]], initiated to form an interim government and invited opposition leaders to join him. Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] had signaled his readiness to recognize the interim government. However, Aung San Suu Kyi categorically rejected U Nu's plan by saying "the future of the opposition would be decided by masses of the people". Ex-Brigadier General [[Aung Gyi]], another influential politician at the time of the 8888 crisis and the first chairman in the history of the NLD, followed the suit and rejected the plan after Aung San Suu Kyi's refusal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Aung San Suu Kyi: Between Biographical Myth and Hard Realities | author=Susanne Prager-Nyein | journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia |date=February 2013 | volume=3 | issue=43 | pages=546–554 | doi=10.1080/00472336.2013.771942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aung Gyi later accused several NLD members of being communists and resigned from the party.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

In 1990, the military junta called a [[Burmese general election, 1990|general election]], in which the National League for Democracy (NLD) received 59% of the votes, guaranteeing NLD 80% of the parliament seats.

Instead, the results were nullified and the military refused to hand over power, resulting in an international outcry. Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest at her home on University Avenue ({{Coord|16|49|32|N|96|9|1|E|region:MM_type:landmark}}) in Rangoon, during which time she was awarded the [[Sakharov Prize]] for Freedom of Thought in 1990, and the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] the year after. Her sons [[Alexander Aris|Alexander]] and Kim accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf.

... Suu Kyi's struggle is one of the most extraordinary examples of civil courage in Asia in recent decades. She has become an important symbol in the struggle against oppression ...

... In awarding the Nobel Peace Prize for 1991 to Aung San Suu Kyi, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to honour this woman for her unflagging efforts and to show its support for the many people throughout the world who are striving to attain democracy, human rights and ethnic conciliation by peaceful means.|Oslo, 14 October 1991}}

In 1995 Aung San Suu Kyi delivered the keynote address at the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] in Beijing.&lt;ref name="nobelprize.org"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=nobelprize.org |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991/kyi-bio.html |title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1991 |accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996 attack===
On 9 November 1996, the [[motorcade]] that Aung San Suu Kyi was traveling in with other [[National League for Democracy]] leaders [[Tin Oo]] and [[Kyi Maung]], was attacked in Yangon. About 200 men swooped down on the motorcade, wielding metal chains, metal batons, stones and other weapons. The car that Aung San Suu Kyi was in had its rear window smashed, and the car with Tin Oo and Kyi Maung had its rear window and two backdoor windows shattered. It is believed the offenders were members of the [[Union Solidarity and Development Association]] (USDA) who were allegedly paid 500 [[kyat]]s (@ USD $0.50) each to participate. The NLD lodged an official complaint with the police, and according to reports the government launched an investigation, but no action was taken. ([[Amnesty International]] 120297)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aappb.org/biography_1.html|title=Aung San Suu Kyi profile|publisher=Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma)|accessdate=5 November 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104202315/http://www.aappb.org/biography_1.html|archivedate=4 November 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House arrest===
Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under [[house arrest]] for a total of 15 years over a 21-year period, on numerous occasions, since she began her political career,&lt;ref name=sk&gt;Moe, Wait (3 August 2009). [http://www2.irrawaddy.org/highlight.php?art_id=16470 Suu Kyi Questions Burma's Judiciary, Constitution]. ''[[The Irrawaddy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; during which time she was prevented from meeting her party supporters and international visitors. In an interview, she said that while under house arrest she spent her time reading philosophy, politics and biographies that her husband had sent her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZFpURJGv00&amp;feature=related Aung San Suu Kyi interview (video)]. YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; She also passed the time playing the piano, and was occasionally allowed visits from foreign diplomats as well as from her personal physician.&lt;ref&gt;Buncombe, Andrew (5 July 2009). [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/5000-days-in-captivity-the-worlds-most-famous-political-prisoner-and-a-dismal-landmark-1731998.html 5,000 days in captivity: The world's most famous political prisoner and a dismal landmark]. ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although under house arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi was granted permission to leave Burma under the condition that she never return, which she refused: "As a mother, the greater sacrifice was giving up my sons, but I was always aware of the fact that others had given up more than me. I never forget that my colleagues who are in prison suffer not only physically, but mentally for their families who have no security outside- in the larger prison of Burma under authoritarian rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Voice of Hope: Conversations with Alan Clements|author=Aung San Suu Kyi|year=1998|publisher=Seven Stories Press|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her loyalty to the people of Burma and her solidarity with those imprisoned for their pro-democratic acts have earned her deep respect among the Burmese people.

The media were also prevented from visiting Aung San Suu Kyi, as occurred in 1998 when journalist [[Maurizio Giuliano]], after photographing her, was stopped by customs officials who then confiscated all his films, tapes and some notes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=BBAB&amp;d_place=BBAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F98E4ECFAA2A5EF&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Burma expels Italian reporter for "illegal reporting], TV Myanmar, Rangoon, 18 August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Aung San Suu Kyi did have visits from government representatives, such as during her autumn 1994 house arrest when she met the leader of Burma, General [[Than Shwe]] and General [[Khin Nyunt]] on 20 September in the first meeting since she had been placed in detention.&lt;ref name="azjarp" /&gt; On several occasions during her house arrest, she had periods of poor health and as a result was hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick |last=Wadhams|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060901000.html |title=Myanmar's Suu Kyi Hospitalized |agency=Associated Press |work=The Washington Post |date=9 June 2006 |accessdate=9 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burmese government detained and kept Aung San Suu Kyi imprisoned because it viewed her as someone "likely to undermine the community peace and stability" of the country, and used both Article 10(a) and 10(b) of the 1975 State Protection Act (granting the government the power to imprison people for up to five years without a trial),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=5798 Opposition Condemns Extension of Suu Kyi's Detention], The Irrawaddy, 27 May 2006.

===United Nations involvement===
The United Nations (UN) has attempted to facilitate dialogue between the [[military junta|junta]] and Aung San Suu Kyi.&lt;ref name = "azjarp"/&gt; On 6 May 2002, following secret confidence-building negotiations led by the UN, the government released her; a government spokesman said that she was free to move "because we are confident that we can trust each other". Aung San Suu Kyi proclaimed "a new dawn for the country". However, on 30 May 2003 in an incident similar to the 1996 attack on her, a [[Depayin massacre|government-sponsored mob attacked]] her caravan in the northern village of [[Tabayin|Depayin]], murdering and wounding many of her supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aseanmp.org/resources/Depayin%20Massacre.pdf |title=The Depayin Massacre 2 Years On, Justice Denied |accessdate=4 February 2007 |date=30 May 2005 |format=PDF |publisher=ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Burma Caucus |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614185341/http://www.aseanmp.org/resources/Depayin%20Massacre.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aung San Suu Kyi fled the scene with the help of her driver, Kyaw Soe Lin, but was arrested upon reaching [[Ye-U]]. The government imprisoned her at [[Insein Prison]] in Rangoon. After she underwent a [[hysterectomy]] in September 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3119038.stm | title =Suu Kyi has 'major' operation |publisher=BBC News | date =19 September 2003 | accessdate =4 July 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the government again placed her under house arrest in Rangoon.

The results from the UN facilitation have been mixed; [[Razali Ismail]], UN special envoy to Burma, met with Aung San Suu Kyi. Ismail resigned from his post the following year, partly because he was denied re-entry to Burma on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://english.dvb.no/news.php?id=6287 | title =Annan expresses sadness for the resignation of his envoy for Burma | publisher=Democratic Voice of Burma | date =10 January 2006 | accessdate =4 July 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928172156/http://english.dvb.no/news.php?id=6287 |archivedate = 28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several years later in 2006, [[Ibrahim Gambari]], UN [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations|Undersecretary-General]] (USG) of [[United Nations Department of Political Affairs|Department of Political Affairs]], met with Aung San Suu Kyi, the first visit by a foreign official since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=20 May 2006 |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=18557&amp;Cr=Myanmar&amp;Cr1= |title=After meeting Aung San Suu Kyi, UN envoy leaves Burma|publisher=United Nations |accessdate=22 May 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060528170633/http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=18557&amp;Cr=Myanmar&amp;Cr1=| archivedate= 28 May 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also met with Suu Kyi later the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/International/2006/11/11/010-emissaire-suukyi.shtml |title=Rare visite |accessdate=12 January 2007 |date=8 January 2007 |publisher=CBC/Radio-Canada |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 October 2007 Gambari returned to talk to her again after seeing [[Than Shwe]] and other members of the senior leadership in [[Naypyidaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UN envoy meets with Burma's top general to discuss 'current situation' |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=24129 |publisher=UN News Service |date=2 October 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[State television]] broadcast Aung San Suu Kyi with Gambari, stating that they had met twice. This was Aung San Suu Kyi's first appearance in state media in the four years since her current detention began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Burma junta releases footage of Suu Kyi (AFP) |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/06/2052595.htm |publisher=ABC News (Australia) |date=6 October 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2007 |language=en | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011095451/http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/06/2052595.htm| archivedate= 11 October 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Working Group for Arbitrary Detention published an Opinion that Aung San Suu Kyi's deprivation of liberty was arbitrary and in contravention of Article 9 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] 1948, and requested that the authorities in Burma set her free, but the authorities ignored the request at that time.&lt;ref name="unWrkGrp"&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/wgad/9-2004.html Daw Aung San Suu Kyi v. Myanmar], U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, U.N. Doc. E/CN.4/2005/6/Add.1 at 47 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The U.N. report said that according to the Burmese Government's reply, "Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has not been arrested, but has only been taken into protective custody, for her own safety", and while "it could have instituted legal action against her under the country's domestic legislation&amp;nbsp; ... it has preferred to adopt a magnanimous attitude, and is providing her with protection in her own interests".&lt;ref name="unWrkGrp" /&gt;

Such claims were rejected by Brig-General [[Khin Yi]], Chief of [[Myanmar Police Force]] (MPF). On 18 January 2007, the [[State media|state-run]] paper ''[[New Light of Myanmar]]'' accused Suu Kyi of [[tax evasion]] for spending her Nobel Prize money outside the country. The accusation followed the defeat of a US-sponsored [[United Nations Security Council]] resolution condemning Burma as a threat to international security; the resolution was defeated because of strong opposition from China, which has strong ties with the military junta (China later voted against the resolution, along with Russia and South Africa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/world/asia/19myanmar.html |title=Burmese Daily at Odds With Democracy Advocate |author=Mydans, Seth |accessdate=19 January 2007 |date=18 January 2008 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, it was reported that Aung San Suu Kyi would meet her political allies [[National League for Democracy]] along with a government minister. The ruling junta made the official announcement on state TV and radio just hours after UN special envoy [[Ibrahim Gambari]] ended his second visit to Burma. The NLD confirmed that it had received the invitation to hold talks with Suu Kyi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7085292.stm |title=Suu Kyi to meet party colleagues|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 November 2007|date=8 November 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071109163856/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7085292.stm| archivedate= 9 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the process delivered few concrete results.

On 3 July 2009, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] went to Burma to pressure the junta into releasing Aung San Suu Kyi and to institute democratic reform. However, on departing from Burma, Ban Ki-moon said he was "disappointed" with the visit after junta leader [[Than Shwe]] refused permission for him to visit Aung San Suu Kyi, citing her ongoing trial. Ban said he was "deeply disappointed that they have missed a very important opportunity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Heilprin |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/05/un-chief-leaves-myanmar-039disappointed039-with-junta.html |title=UN chief leaves Myanmar 'disappointed' with junta |work=The Jakarta Post |date=5 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714054213/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/05/un-chief-leaves-myanmar-039disappointed039-with-junta.html |archivedate=14 July 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions were held between Suu Kyi and the Burmese government during 2011, which led to a number of official gestures to meet her demands. In October, around a tenth of Burma's political prisoners were freed in an amnesty and trade unions were legalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burma frees dozens of political prisoners|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15269259|accessdate=19 November 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burma law to allow labour unions and strikes|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15303968|accessdate=19 November 2011|publisher=BBC News|date=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2011, Thai Prime Minister [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] met Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangoon, marking Aung San Suu Kyi's "first-ever meeting with the leader of a foreign country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PM Yingluck backs Suu Kyi in landmark Myanmar talks|url=http://www.manager.co.th/Home/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9540000162276|newspaper=WBDJ7|date=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2012, British Foreign Minister William Hague met Aung San Suu Kyi and his Burmese counterpart. This represented a significant visit for Aung San Suu Kyi and Burma. Aung San Suu Kyi studied in the UK and maintains many ties there, whilst Britain is Burma's largest bilateral donor.
During Aung San Suu Kyi's visit to Europe, she visited the Swiss parliament, collected her 1991 Nobel Prize in Oslo and her honorary degree from Oxford University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18454243 | title=Aung San Suu Kyi to visit Swiss parliament | date=15 June 2012 | publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she and other MP-elects were expected to take office on 23 April when the Hluttaws resumed session, National League for Democracy MP-elects, including Aung San Suu Kyi, said they might not take their oaths because of its wording; in its present form, parliamentarians must vow to "safeguard" the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/20/us-myanmar-idUSBRE83J0AI20120420|title=Suu Kyi Myanmar parliament debut in doubt over oath stalemate|author=Aung Hla Tun|date=20 April 2012|agency=Reuters|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The line in question is Schedule Four of the 2008 Constitution (Form of Oaths or Affirmation), which states: "After being elected as an MP, I do solemnly swear to preserve, protect, and nurture the Constitution while following the nation's laws."

The NLD won a sweeping victory in those elections, winning at least 255 seats in the House of Representatives and 135 seats in the House of Nationalities. In addition, Aung San Suu Kyi won re-election to the House of Representatives. Under the 2008 constitution, the NLD needed to win at least a two-thirds majority in both houses to ensure that its candidate would become president. Before the elections, Aung San Suu Kyi announced that even though she is constitutionally barred from the presidency, she would hold the real power in any NLD-led government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy Wins Majority in Myanmar |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34805806 |accessdate=13 November 2015 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 March 2016 she became Minister for the President's Office, for Foreign Affairs, for Education and for Electric Power and Energy in President [[Htin Kyaw]]'s government; later she relinquished the latter two ministries and President Htin Kyaw appointed her [[State Counsellor (Myanmar)|State Counsellor]], a position akin to a [[Prime Minister of Myanmar|Prime Minister]] created especially for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/burmese/burma/2016/03/160321_dassk_foreign_minister|title=ဒေါ်စု နိုင်ငံခြားရေးဝန်ကြီး ဖြစ်လာမလား|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VOA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://editorials.voa.gov/content/burmese-parliamentary-elections-146265885/1493313.html |title=Burmese Parliamentary Elections |date=4 April 2012 |publisher=Voice of America News |accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NLD Claims Suu Kyi Victory"&gt;[http://www.irrawaddy.org/archives/1661 NLD Claims Suu Kyi Victory], The Irrawaddy, 4 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign Minister and State Counsellor (2016–present)===
[[File:The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi receiving the State Counsellor of Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi, in Hyderabad House, New Delhi on January 24, 2018.jpg|thumb|Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] meeting Aung San Suu Kyi in New Delhi, 24 January 2018]]
As soon as she became foreign minister, she invited Chinese Foreign Minister [[Wang Yi (politician)|Wang Yi]], Canadian Foreign Minister [[Stephane Dion]] and Italian Foreign Minister [[Paolo Gentiloni]] in April and Japanese Foreign Minister [[Fumio Kishida]] in May and discussed to have good diplomatic relationships with these countries.{{citation needed|date= May 2016}}

Initially, upon accepting the State Counsellor position, she granted amnesty to the students who were arrested for opposing the [[Myanmar National Education Law 2014|National Education Bill]], and announced a creation of the commission on [[Rakhine state]], which had a long record of persecution of the Muslim [[Rohingya]] minority. However, soon Aung San Suu Kyi's government did not manage with the ethnic conflicts in [[Shan state|Shan]] and [[Kachin state]]s, where thousands of refugees fled to China, and by 2017 the [[2017 Rohingya persecution in Myanmar|persecution of the Rohingya by the government forces]] escalated to the point that it is not uncommonly called a genocide. Aung San Suu Kyi, when interviewed, has denied the allegations of ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/31/aung-san-suu-kyi-myanmars-great-hope-fails-to-live-up-to-expectations|title=Aung San Suu Kyi: Myanmar's great hope fails to live up to expectations|last=McPherson|first=Poppy|date=31 March 2017|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-39510271|title=Myanmar: Aung San Suu Kyi exclusive interview|last=Keane|first=Fergal|date=5 April 2017|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also refused to grant citizenship to the Rohingya, instead taking steps to issue ID cards for residency but no guarantees of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-myanmar-rohingya-2017-story.html|title=Myanmar's long-suffering Rohingya Muslims hoped that Aung San Suu Kyi would make them full citizens.

Her tenure as State Counsellor of Myanmar has drawn international criticism for her failure to address her country's economic and ethnic problems, particularly the plight of the [[Rohingya]] following the [[Northern Rakhine State clashes#25 August 2017 ARSA attacks|25 August 2017 ARSA attacks]] (described as "certainly one of the biggest refugee crises and cases of ethnic cleansing since the [[second world war]]"), for the weakening of [[freedom of the press]] and for her style of leadership, described as imperious and "distracted and out of touch".&lt;ref name="veconomist5" &gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Is the world getting Myanmar wrong?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21730684-future-not-long-ago-deemed-bright-now-feels-bleak-world-getting-myanmar-wrong|work=[[The Economist]]|date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press freedom is waning in Myanmar|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21738413-no-law-too-obscure-tool-silence-awkward-journalists-press-freedom-waning-myanmar|accessdate=9 March 2018|work=[[The Economist]]|date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response to violence against Rohingya Muslims and refugees====
In 2017, critics have called for Aung San Suu Kyi's Nobel prize to be revoked, citing her silence over the [[Rohingya persecution in Myanmar (2016–present)|persecution of Rohingya people]] in Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/world-travel/asia/should-aung-san-suu-kyi-give-back-her-nobel-peace-prize/news-story/2a2e214551ba4e490b99116c5a9fc406|title=Should Aung San Suu Kyi give back her Nobel Peace Prize?|work=News.com.au|date=6 September 2017|accessdate=6 September 2017|first=Kirrily|last=Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/04/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-suu-kyi-.html?mcubz=3|title=Why Aung San Suu Kyi's Nobel Peace Prize Won't Be Revoked|work=The New York Times|date=4 September 2017|accessdate=6 September 2017|first=Russell|last=Goldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 BBC News article, reporter [[Jonah Fisher]] suggested that Aung San Suu Kyi's silence over the Rohingya issue is due to a need to obtain support from the majority [[Bamar people|Bamar]] ethnicity as she is in "the middle of [[Myanma general election, 2015|a general election]] campaign".&lt;ref name="bbcfisher"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-32974061|title=Aung San Suu Kyi: Where are you?|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] publicly called upon her to do more to help the Rohingya in Myanmar, claiming that he had previously urged her to address the plight of the Rohingya in private during two separate meetings and that she had resisted his urging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dalai Lama presses Aung San Suu Kyi over Rohingya migrants|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32925805|accessdate=3 June 2015|publisher=BBC|date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi asked the newly appointed [[United States Ambassador to Myanmar]], [[Scot Marciel]], not to refer to the Rohingya by that name as they "are not recognized as among the 135 official ethnic groups" in Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-aung-san-suu-kyi.html?_r=0 | title=Aung San Suu Kyi Asks U.S. Not to Refer to Rohingya | date=6 May 2016 | accessdate=7 May 2016 | publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed [[Bamar people|Bamar]] protests at Marciel's use of the word "Rohingya".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sanctions on Myanmar|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21699166-america-tweaks-sanctions-not-wholly-democratic-country-not-clear-yet|accessdate=20 May 2016|work=The Economist|date=20 May 2016|quote=Suu Kyi unsettled Western diplomats (who not long ago used unequivocally to adore her) when she asked the new American ambassador not to refer to a persecuted Muslim minority by their name, the Rohingyas.

In 2016, Aung San Suu Kyi was accused of failing to protect Myanmar's [[Rohingya people|Rohingya Muslims]] during the [[2016–17 Rohingya persecution in Myanmar|2016–17 persecution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/17/asia/myanmar-rohingya-aung-san-suu-kyi/ Is The Lady listening?

In early October 2018, both the Canadian Senate and its House of Commons voted unanimously to strip Aung San Suu Kyi of her honourary citizenship.

Asked what democratic models Myanmar could look to, she said: "We have many, many lessons to learn from various places, not just the [[Asian countries]] like [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], [[Mongolia]], and [[Indonesia]]." She also cited "the [[eastern European]] countries, which made the transition from communist autocracy to democracy in the 1980s and 1990s, and the [[Latin American]] countries, which made the transition from military governments. "And we cannot of course forget South Africa, because although it wasn't a military regime, it was certainly an authoritarian regime." She added: "We wish to learn from everybody who has achieved a transition to democracy, and also&amp;nbsp; ... our great strong point is that, because we are so far behind everybody else, we can also learn which mistakes we should avoid."&lt;ref name="LA Speech"&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g7jcSqNCiDcId7mEJs9DXzmqzGtA?docId=CNG.a49d8e2a5f23889e2d2987feb130e63f.31 Myanmar's Suu Kyi ends US trip, hailing democracy], AFP, 3 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation secured several opinions from the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention that her detention was in violation of international law; engaged in political advocacy such as spearheading a letter from 112 former presidents and Prime Ministers to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urging him to go to Burma to seek her release, which he did six weeks later; and published numerous opeds and spoke widely to the media about her ongoing detention. Its representation of her ended when she was released from house arrest on 13 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110204230501/http://www.freedom-now.org/campaign/aung-san-suu-kyi/ www.freedom-now.org]. www.freedom-now.org.

'''Authority''' has been considered in [[Sociological theory|sociological]] terms as indicating the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] or socially approved use of power. It is the legitimate power which one person or a group holds and exercises over another. The element of legitimacy is vital to the notion of authority and is the main means by which authority is distinguished from the more general concept of power. Power can be exerted by the use of force or [[violence]]. Authority, by contrast, depends on the acceptance by [[subordinate]]s of the right of those above them to give them orders or [[wiktionary:directive|directive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Giddens, Sociology. London: Polity Press, 1997:581&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber in "Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society: New Translations for the 21st Century", translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters.  pp. 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Authorities==
The types of political authority were first defined by [[Max Weber]] in his essay "[[Politics as a Vocation]]" and his other writings in 1919-1920.  In this essay he emphasized that the political authority that controlled the state can be composed of the following types of authority, or what is called in German, ''Herrschaft''.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, Palgrave Books 2015, pp. 137-138&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Traditional authority|Traditional Authority]]:''' Power legitimized by respect for long-established cultural patterns.

'''[[Charismatic authority|Charismatic Authority]]:''' Power legitimized by extraordinary personal abilities that inspire devotion and obedience.

'''[[Rational-legal authority|Rational-Legal Authority]]:''' Also known as bureaucratic authority, is when power is legitimized by legally enacted rules and regulations such as governments.

[[Max Weber]], in his sociological and philosophical work, identified and distinguished three types of legitimate domination (''Herrschaft'' in German, which generally means 'domination' or 'rule'), that have sometimes been rendered in English translation as types of authority, because [[Dominance (ethology)|domination]] is not seen as a political concept in the first place.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Weber defined domination (authority) as the chance of commands being obeyed by a specifiable group of people.  Legitimate authority is that which is recognized as legitimate and justified by both the ruler and the ruled.Legitimated rule results in what Weber called the monopoly over the use of coercive violence in a given territory.&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, translated and edited by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, Palgrave Books 2015, pp. 136&lt;/ref&gt;  In the modern world, such authority is typically delegated to a police and court system.

Weber divided legitimate authority into three types:

*The first type discussed by Weber is ''[[rational-legal authority]]''. It is that form of authority which depends for its [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] on formal rules and established laws of the state, which are usually written down and are often very complex. The power of the rational legal authority is mentioned in the constitution. Modern societies depend on legal-rational authority. Government officials are the best example of this form of authority, which is prevalent all over the world.
*The second type of authority, ''[[traditional authority]]'', derives from long-established customs, habits and social structures. When power passes from one generation to another, it is known as traditional authority. The rule of hereditary [[Monarchy|monarchs]] furnishes an obvious example. The [[Tudor dynasty]] in England and the ruling families of [[Mewar]] in [[Rajasthan]] (India) are some examples of traditional authority.
* The third form of authority is ''[[charismatic authority]]''. Here, the charisma of the individual or the leader plays an important role. Charismatic authority is that authority which is derived from the leader's claims to a higher power or inspiration that is supported by his or her followers. Examples in this regard can be [[NT Rama Rao]], a matinee idol, who went on to become one of the most powerful Chief Ministers of [[Andhra Pradesh]].

History has witnessed several [[Social movement|social movements]] or [[Revolution|revolutions]] against a system of traditional or legal-rational authority started by Charismatic authorities. According to Weber, what distinguishes authority from [[coercion]], [[Force (law)|force]] and [[Coercion|power]] on the one hand, and leadership, [[persuasion]] and [[Social influence|influence]] on the other hand, is legitimacy. Superiors, he states, feel that they have a right to issue commands; subordinates perceive an obligation to obey. Social scientists{{who|date=November 2010}} agree that authority is but one of several resources available to incumbents in formal positions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} For example, a Head of State is dependent upon a similar nesting of authority. His legitimacy must be acknowledged, not just by citizens, but by those who control other valued resources: his immediate staff, his cabinet, military leaders and in the long run, the administration and political apparatus of the entire society.

Authority can be created expressly when public entities act publicly, using the same means to communicate the grant of authority to their agents that they use to communicate this to third parties, apparent authority describes the situation when a principal has placed restrictions on an agent that are not known to a third party, and restrictions on government agents are accomplished in the open, through laws and regulations. In this setting, all parties concerned is assumed or supposed to know the laws and regulations of government.

Recently the concept of authority has also been discussed as a guiding principle in human–machine interaction design.&lt;ref&gt;Flemisch, F., Heesen, M., Hesse, T., Kelsch, J., Schieben, A., &amp; Beller, J. (2011). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/x63032819hx560m3/ Towards a Dynamic Balance between Humans and Automation: Authority, Ability, Responsibility and Control in Cooperative Control Situations]. ''Cognition, Technology and Work''. Advance online publication. doi: 10.1007/s10111-011-0191-6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children and the Three Authority Attributes ==
Authority and its attributes have been identified as of particular relevance to children as they regard their parents and teachers. The three attributes of authority have been described as ''status'', ''specialist skills'' or ''knowledge'', and ''social position''. Children consider the type of command, the characteristics of the authority figure, and the social context when making authority conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Laupa, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although children regard these three types of authority attributes, they firstly assess the legitimacy of the authority figure in question using the nature of the commands they give. For example, a teacher that does not appear to have legitimate power from the child’s perspective (perhaps because she or he cannot control the class well) will not be obeyed. Regarding parenting, authoritative parents who are warm and high in behavioural control but low in psychological control are more likely to be seen as having legitimate authority by the child, and will believe themselves that they have a duty to obey them and internalise their values.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, Cumsille &amp; Martínez, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bakeys was founded by Narayana Peesapathy in 2010 in Hyderabad. In April 2016, it earned a crowd-funding of around {{INRconvert|25|l}} from 1500+ backers through Ketto with its initial goal being only {{INRconvert|1|l}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.ketto.org/bakeys|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=| website=Ketto| publisher=|access-date=31 May 2016|title=Eat Your Spoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this support, the company started a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to increase its reach.&lt;ref name="ZME 2016"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.zmescience.com/ecology/environmental-issues/bakeys-spoon-53749/|last1=Micu|first1=Alexandra|last2=|first2=|date=30 March 2016| website=ZME Science| publisher=|access-date=31 May 2016|title=India’s Bakey edible spoon does two of my favorite things: limits dishes and plastic waste}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1240116767/edible-cutlery-the-future-of-eco-friendly-utensils/description|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=April 2016| website=[[Kickstarter]]| publisher=|access-date=31 May 2016|title=Edible Cutlery: The Future of Eco Friendly Utensils}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the company had 30 employees.&lt;ref name="TET 2016"/&gt; As of May 2017 the company had not yet started shipping to backers of the Kickstarter, though shipments of the spoons to customers in India, has been proceeding without issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1240116767/edible-cutlery-the-future-of-eco-friendly-utensils/posts/1787901 | date=19 January 2017 | website=Kickstarter | title=Kickstarter Campaign Update}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Kickstarter backers are currently attempting legal action against Bakeys due to no response after pledging over $250,000 in US dollars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9178">'''Cognitive ergonomics''', defined by the [[International Ergonomics Association]] "is concerned with mental processes, such as perception, memory, reasoning, and motor response, as they affect interactions among humans and other elements of a system. The relevant topics include mental workload, decision-making, skilled performance, [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interaction]], human reliability, work stress and training as these may relate to human-system design."&lt;ref name="IEA website"&gt;[http://www.iea.cc/whats/index.html What is Ergonomics?] International Ergonomics Association&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive ergonomics studies cognition in work and operational settings, in order to optimize human well-being and system performance.  It is a subset of the larger field of [[human factors and ergonomics]].

== Goals ==
Cognitive ergonomics (sometimes known as [[cognitive engineering]] though this was an earlier field) is an emerging branch of [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomics]] which places particular emphasis on the analysis of [[cognitive]] processes required of operators in modern industries and similar milieus.   Examples include diagnosis, workload, situation awareness, [[decision making]], and planning. Cognitive ergonomics aims at enhancing performance of cognitive tasks by means of several interventions, including these:
*user-centered design of human-machine interaction and [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI);
*design of information technology systems that support cognitive tasks (e.g., cognitive artifacts);
*development of training programs;
*work redesign to manage [[cognitive workload]] and increase [[human reliability]].

== History ==
The field of cognitive ergonomics emerged predominantly in the 70's with the advent of the personal computer and new developments in the fields of [[cognitive psychology]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. CE contrasts the tradition of physical ergonomics because "cognitive ergonomics is...the application of [[psychology]] to work...to achieve the optimization between people and their work."&lt;ref name="Long 2000"&gt;{{cite news |title= Cognitive ergonomics - past, present, future: 10 lessons learned (10 lessons remaining) Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society ... Annual Meeting |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/235419773/ |newspaper= human factors and ergonomics society |date= June 6, 2010 |accessdate= November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewed as an applied science, the methods involved with creating cognitive ergonomic design have changed with the rapid development in technological advances over the last 27 years. In the 80's, there was a worldwide transition in the methodological approach to design. According to van der Veer, [[Enid Mumford]] was one of the pioneers of [[interactive systems engineering]], and advocated the notion of user-centered design, wherein the user is considered and "included in all phases of the design".&lt;ref name="Van der veer 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=van der veer GC |title= Cognitive Ergonomics in Interface Design – Discussion of a Moving Science |journal= journal of universal computer science |volume=14 |issue=16 |pages=2614–2629 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several different models which describe the criteria for designing user-friendly technology. A number of models focus on a systematic process for design, using [[task analysis]] to evaluate the cognitive processes involved with a given task and develop adequate interface capabilities. Task analysis in past research has focused on the evaluation of cognitive task demands, concerning motor control and cognition during visual tasks such as operating machinery, or the evaluation of [[attention]] and focus via the analysis of eye saccades of pilots when flying.&lt;ref name="Van der veer 2008" /&gt;  [[Neuroergonomics]], a subfield of cognitive ergonomics, aims to enhance [[human-computer interaction]] by using neural correlates to better understand situational task demands. Neuroergonomic research at the university of Iowa has been involved with assessing safe-driving protocol,  enhancing elderly mobility, and analyzing cognitive abilities involved with the navigation of abstract virtual environments."&lt;ref name="IDNU"&gt;[http://www.uiowa.edu/~neuroerg/research.html Division of Neuroergonomics] University of Iowa Division of Neuroscience&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Successful, [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomic]] intervention in the area of cognitive tasks requires [[Industrial &amp; Organizational Assessment|a thorough understanding not only of the demands of the work situation]], but also of user strategies in performing cognitive tasks and of limitations in human cognition. In some cases, the artifacts or tools used to carry out a task may impose their own constraints and limitations (e.g., navigating through a large number of GUI screens). Tools may also co-determine the very nature of the task.&lt;ref name="Van der veer 2008" /&gt; In this sense, the analysis of cognitive tasks should examine both the interaction of users with their work setting  and the user interaction with artifacts or tools; the latter is very important as modern artifacts (e.g., control panels, software, expert systems) become increasingly sophisticated. Emphasis lies on how to design human-machine interfaces and cognitive artifacts so that human performance is sustained in work environments where information may be unreliable, events may be difficult to predict, multiple simultaneous goals may be in conflict, and performance may be time constrained.&lt;ref name= "Lee 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lee JD |title= Emerging challenges in cognitive ergonomics: managing swarms of self-organizing agent-based automation |journal= Theoretical Issues in ergonomic science |volume= 2 |issue= 3 |pages= 238–250 |year= 2001 |doi=10.1080/14639220110104925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|User interface modeling}}

=== Cognitive task analysis ===
{{See also|Task analysis}}
''Cognitive task analysis'' is a general term for the set of methods used to identify the mental demands and cognitive skills needed to complete a task.&lt;ref name="Militello et al. 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hutton RJB, Militello LG |title= applied cognitive task analysis (ACTA): a practitioner’s toolkit for understanding cognitive task demands |journal= Ergonomics |volume= 41|issue= 11 |pages= 1618–1641 |year= 1998 |doi=10.1080/001401398186108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frameworks like [[GOMS]] provide a formal set of methods for identifying the mental activities required by a task and an artifact, such as a desktop computer system. By identifying the sequence of mental activities of a user engaged in a task, cognitive ergonomics engineers can identify bottlenecks and critical paths that may present opportunities for improvement or risks (such as [[human error]]) that merit changes in training or system behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, K. M., Helton, W. S., &amp; Wiggins, M. W. (2013). Cognitive engineering. Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science, 4(1), 17-31.{{DOI|10.1002/wcs.1204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
As a design philosophy, cognitive ergonomics can be applied to any area where humans interact with technology. Applications include aviation (e.g., cockpit layouts),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baxter|first1=Gordon|last2=Besnard|first2=Denis|last3=Riley|first3=Dominic|title=Cognitive mismatches in the cockpit: Will they ever be a thing of the past?|journal=Applied Ergonomics|date=July 2007|volume=38|issue=4|pages=417-423|doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2007.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; transportation (e.g., collision avoidance), the health care system (e.g., drug bottle labelling), mobile devices, appliance interface design, product design, and nuclear power plants.

'''Conflict transformation''' is a concept designed to reframe the way in which [[peacebuilding]] initiatives are discussed and pursued, particularly in contexts of [[ethnic conflict]]. Traditionally the emphasis has been on [[conflict resolution]] and [[conflict management]] methods, which focus on reducing or defusing outbreaks of hostility.  '''Conflict transformation''', in contrast, places a greater weight on addressing the underlying conditions which give rise to that conflict, preferably well in advance of any hostility, but also to ensure a [[sustainable]] peace. In other terms, it attempts to make explicit and then reshape the social structures and dynamics behind the conflict, often employing analytical tools borrowed from [[systems thinking]]. "The very structure of parties and relationships may be embedded in a pattern of conflictual relationships that extend beyond the particular site of conflict. Conflict transformation is therefore a process of engaging with and transforming the relationships, interests, discourses and, if necessary, the very constitution of society that supports the continuation of violent conflict".&lt;ref name="Miall"&gt;Hugh Miall (2004) [http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Handbook/Articles/miall_handbook.pdf Conflict Transformation: A Multi-Dimensional Task], Berghof Handbook for Conflict Transformation, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict transformation approaches differ from those of [[conflict management]] or [[conflict resolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Books/Book_Glossary_Chapters_en/berghof_glossary_2012_02_conflict_prevention_management_resolution.pdf Berghof Glossary, Conflict Prevention, Management, Resolution] on [http://www.berghof-foundation.org Berghof Foundation's] web&lt;/ref&gt;
Whereas conflict transformation involves transforming the relationships that support violence, conflict management approaches seek to merely manage and contain conflict, and conflict resolution approaches seek to move conflict parties away from [[zero-sum]] positions towards positive outcomes, often with the help of external actors.&lt;ref name="Miall"/&gt;

Conflict transformation theory and practice are often associated with the academics and practitioners [[Johan Galtung]] and [[John Paul Lederach]].
&lt;!--sources by name, further (organizations, institutions) following after Galtung (and Lederach, to be added yet)--&gt;
According to [[Johan Galtung]]'s ''[[Transcend Method]]'' conflict transformation theory and practice, and process/es, comprise:&lt;ref name=galtung-un-2000-p10&gt;[[Johan Galtung]]: ''The Transcend Method at a glance: a one-page version'' (page 5) in: [https://www.transcend.org/pctrcluj2004/TRANSCEND_manual.pdf ''Conflict Transformation by Peaceful Means (the Transcend Method) – Participants'/Trainers' Manual''], United Nations 2000 (at [https://www.transcend.org/ transcend.org])&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''following [[Buddhist]] thought...&lt;br&gt;Codependent origination, everything grows together in mutual causation. Conflicts have no beginning and no end, we all share the responsibility; no single actor (like statesmen) carries all the responsibility (monopoly) and no single actor carries all the guilt.''
# ''following [[Christian]] thought...&lt;br&gt;Ultimately, the responsibility for conflict transformation lies with individuals and their individual responsibility and decisions to act so as to promote peace rather than violence, and the principle of hope.''
# ''following [[Daoist]] thought...&lt;br&gt;Everything is yin and yang, good and bad, there is the high likelihood that the action chosen also has negative consequences and that action not chosen may have positive consequences; hence the need for reversibility, only doing what can be undone.''
# ''following [[Islamic]] thought...&lt;br&gt;The strength deriving from submitting together to a common goal, including the concrete responsibility for the well-being of all.''
# ''following [[Judaic]] thought...&lt;br&gt;The truth lies less in a verbal formula than in the dialogue to arrive at the formula, and that dialogue has no beginning and no end.''

According to [[Berghof Foundation]], conflict transformation means:
:: ''A generic, comprehensive term referring to actions and processes seeking to alter the various characteristics and manifestations of violent conflict by addressing the root causes of a particular conflict over the long term. It aims to transform negative destructive conflict into positive constructive conflict and deals with structural, behavioural and attitudinal aspects of conflict. The term refers to both the process and the completion of the process. As such, it incorporates the activities of processes such as conflict prevention and conflict resolution and goes farther than conflict settlement or conflict management.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Handbook/Articles/handbook_glossary.pdf The Berghof Handbook Glossary] &gt; [http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Books/Book_Glossary_Chapters_en/berghof_glossary_2012_03_conflict_transformation.pdf expanded into the Berghof Glossary, Conflict Transformation] on [http://www.berghof-foundation.org Berghof Foundation's] web&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Institute for Conflict Transformation and Peacebuilding]] (ICP), conflict transformation means:
:: ''Conflict transformation, in contrast to conflict resolution, does not only seek to resolve the contradiction in a conflict setting. It also aims at addressing structural and social root causes by challenging injustices and restoring human relations and it deals with ethnical and value-based dimensions. Conflict transformation is not only an approach or a tool but primarily a mindset. Conflict transformation, according to our 3 Cs approach, needs to be comprehensive, compassionate and creative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iicp.ch/node/10 ''ICP: About Conflict Transformation &amp; Peacebuilding''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20150209195513/http://www.iicp.ch/node/10 |date=2015-02-09 }} at ICP web [http://www.iicp.ch/ iicp.ch]&lt;/ref&gt;''

According to [[Search for Common Ground]] conflict transformation initiatives are often characterized by longtime horizons and interventions at multiple levels, aimed at changing perceptions and improving communications skills addressing the roots of conflict, including inequality and social injustice.&lt;ref name="SFCG"&gt;SFCG (no date) [http://www.sfcg.org/resources/resources_terms.html Commonly Used Terms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829005441/http://www.sfcg.org/resources/resources_terms.html |date=2009-08-29 }}, Search for Common Ground&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Principles of Conflict Transformation'', by [[TransConflict]], specify further in order to help with defining conflict transformation:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
:* ''Conflict should not be regarded as an isolated event that can be resolved or managed, but as an integral part of society’s on-going evolution and development;''
:* ''Conflict should not be understood solely as an inherently negative and destructive occurrence, but rather as a potentially positive and productive force for change if harnessed constructively;''
:* ''Conflict transformation goes beyond merely seeking to contain and manage conflict, instead seeking to transform the root causes of a particular conflict;''
:* ''Conflict transformation is a long-term, gradual and complex process, requiring sustained engagement and interaction;''
:* ''Conflict transformation is not just an approach and set of techniques, but a way of thinking about and understanding conflict itself;''
:* ''Conflict transformation is particularly intended for intractable conflicts, where deep-rooted issues fuel protracted violence;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ref name="TransConflict"&gt;[http://www.transconflict.com/advocate/global-coalition-for-conflict-transformation/principles-of-conflict-transformation/ Principles of Conflict Transformation], TransConflict&lt;/ref&gt;''...continued by some ten more...''

'''Contraceptive security''' (CS) is a situation in which people are able to reliably choose, obtain, and use quality [[Birth Control|contraceptives]] for [[family planning]] and the prevention of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/whatwedo/commsecurity|title=Commodity Security}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers primarily to efforts undertaken in [[Developing country|developing countries]] to ensure contraceptive availability as an integral part of family planning programs.

Organizations, usually government health agencies, work to ensure clients have long-term access to a range of high quality contraceptives and other essential health supplies. A framework and tool, the Strategic Pathway to Reproductive Health Commodity Security (SPARHCS), was developed in 2004 by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and partners to help countries identify and prioritize key commodity security issues; assess current capacity for commodity security among country or regional programs, systems and policies; and shape commodity security strategic plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/whatwedo/commsecurity/cssparhcs|title=SPARHCS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measures taken to provide contraceptive security may include strengthening contraceptive supply chains, forming CS committees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/whatwedo/commsecurity/cscommitteetoolkit|title=CS Committee Toolkit}}&lt;/ref&gt; product quality assurance, promoting supportive policy environments, and examining financing options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/whatwedo/commsecurity/csfinancing|title=Financing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strengthening commodity security requires routine monitoring of donor and government commitment, policies, stakeholder coordination, and supply chain information. Tools including the CS Indicators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/rdr?p_url=/dlvr_content/resources/allpubs/logisticsbriefs/CSIndiImprFPProg_1.pdf|title=How Contraceptive Security Indicators Can Be Used to Improve Family Planning Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the CS Index offer ways of measuring contraceptive security, and allow comparisons over time and across countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/whatwedo/commsecurity/csmeasuring|title=Measuring Commodity Security}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent analysis of 48 countries’ CS Index scores between 2003-2012 indicates that all regions improved on measures of supply chain, financing, health and social environment, access, and utilization, with the greatest progress made in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliver.jsi.com/dhome/rdr?p_url=/dlvr_content/resources/allpubs/factsheets/CSIndexbkltEng.pdf|title=Contraceptive Security Index 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsidized products, particularly [[condoms]] and [[oral contraceptives]], may be provided to increase accessibility for low-income people.

'''Counter-mapping''' refers to efforts to [[map]] "against dominant power structures, to further seemingly progressive goals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hodgson|first=D.L|author2=Schroeder, R.A.|title=Dilemmas of Counter-Mapping: Community Resources in Tanzania|journal=Development and Change|year=2002|volume=33|pages=79–100|doi=10.1111/1467-7660.00241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Nancy Peluso&lt;ref name="Peluso"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peluso|first=N.L|title=Whose Woods are These? Counter-Mapping Forest Territories in Kalimantan, Indonesia|journal=Antipode|year=1995|volume=27|series=4|pages=383–406|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8330.1995.tb00286.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995 to describe the commissioning of maps by forest users in [[Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]], as a means of contesting state maps of forest areas that typically undermined [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] interests. The resultant counter-hegemonic maps had the ability to strengthen forest users' resource claims.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; There are numerous expressions closely related to counter-mapping: ethnocartography, alternative cartography, mapping-back, counter-hegemonic mapping, and public participatory mapping.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt; Moreover, the terms: [[critical cartography]], subversive cartography, bio-regional mapping, and remapping are sometimes used interchangeably with counter-mapping, but in practice encompass much more.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt;

Whilst counter-mapping still primarily refers to indigenous cartographic efforts, it is increasingly being applied to non-indigenous [[map]]ping initiatives in economically developed countries.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt; Such counter-mapping efforts have been facilitated by processes of [[neoliberalism]],&lt;ref name="Bryan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bryan|first=J|title=Walking the Line: Participatory Mapping Indigenous Rights, and Neoliberalism|journal=Geoforum|year=2011|volume=42|issue=1|pages=40–50|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2010.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and technological [[democratisation]].&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; Examples of counter-mapping include attempts to demarcate and protect traditional territories, community mapping, [[PPGIS|Public Participatory Geographical Information Systems]], and [[map]]ping by a relatively weak state to counter the resource claims of a stronger state.&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bauer|first=K|title=On the Politics and Possibilities of Participatory Mapping and GIS: Using Spatial Technologies to Study Common Property and Land Use Change Among Pastoralists in Central Tibet|journal=Cultural Geographies|year=2009|volume=16|pages=229–252|doi=10.1177/1474474008101518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power of counter-maps to advocate policy change in a [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Management and organization|bottom-up]] manner led commentators to affirm that counter-mapping should be viewed as a tool of [[governance]].&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt;

Despite its emancipatory potential, counter-mapping has not gone without criticism. There is a tendency for counter-mapping efforts to overlook the knowledge of women, minorities, and other vulnerable, disenfranchised groups.&lt;ref name="Rocheleau"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rocheleau|first=D.B|author2=Edmunds, D|title=Women, Men and Trees: Gender, Power and Property in Forest and Agrarian Landscapes.|journal=World Development|year=1997|volume=25|series=8|pages=1351–1371|doi=10.1016/s0305-750x(97)00036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, counter-mapping is only empowering for a small subset of society, whilst others become further marginalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=B.H|title=Community Participation and Geographic Information Systems|journal=The Professional Geographer|year=2004|volume=56|series=2|pages=315–317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

Nancy Peluso, professor of forest policy, coined the term 'counter-mapping' in 1995, having examined the implementation of two forest [[map]]ping strategies in [[Kalimantan]]. One set of maps belonged to state forest managers, and the [[international financial institutions]] that supported them, such as the [[World Bank]]. This strategy recognised mapping as a means of protecting local claims to territory and resources to a government that had previously ignored them.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; The other set of maps had been created by Indonesian [[NGOs]], who often contract international experts to assist with mapping village territories.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; The goal of the second set of maps was to co-opt the cartographic conventions of the Indonesian state, to legitimise the claims by the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] people, indigenous to Kalimantan, to the rights to forest use.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt;  Counter-mappers in Kalimantan have acquired [[GIS]] technologies, satellite technology, and computerised [[resource management]] tools, consequently  making the Indonesian state vulnerable to counter-maps.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; As such, counter-mapping strategies in Kalimantan have led to successful community action to block, and protest against, oil palm plantations and logging concessions imposed by the central government.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt;

It must, however, be recognised that counter-mapping projects existed long before coinage of the term.&lt;ref name="Rundstrom"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rundstrom|first=R|title=Counter-Mapping|journal=International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography|year=2009|pages=314–318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-maps are rooted in map art practices that date to the early 20th century; in the [[Mental mapping|mental maps]] movement of the 1960s; in indigenous and bioregional mapping; and parish mapping.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=D|title=Rethinking the Power of Maps|year=2010|publisher=Guilford Press|location=London |author2=Fels, J. |author3=Krygier, J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parish Maps Project ===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Parish Map.jpg|thumb|right|text-top|border|alt=Salle parish map.|Salle parish map.]] --&gt;In 1985, the charity [[Common Ground (United Kingdom)|Common Ground]] launched the [[Parish Maps Project]], a [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Management and organization|bottom-up]] initiative encouraging local people to map elements of the environment valued by their [[parish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=A|title=Holding Your Ground: An Action Guide to Local Conservation|year=1985|publisher=Penguin|location=London|author2=Clifford, S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, more than 2,500 English parishes have made such maps.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; Parish mapping projects aim to put every local person in an 'expert' role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aberley|first=D|title=Boundaries of Home: Mapping for Local Empowerment|year=1993|publisher=New Society Publishers|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clifford&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clifford|first=S|title=From Place to Place: Maps and Parish Maps|year=1996|publisher=Common Ground|location=London|pages=3–7|editor=Clifford, S. |editor2=King, A.|chapter=Places, People, and Parish Maps}}&lt;/ref&gt; exemplifies this notion, affirming: "making a parish map is about creating a community expression of values, and about beginning to assert ideas for involvement. It is about taking the place in your own hands". The final map product is typically an artistic artefact, usually painted, and often displayed in village halls or schools.&lt;ref name=perkins /&gt;  By questioning the biases of cartographic conventions and challenging predominant power effects of mapping,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=L.M|author2=Hazen, H.D|title=Power of Maps: (Counter) Mapping for Conservation|journal=ACME|year=2006|volume=4|issue=1|pages=99–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parish Maps Project is an early example of what Peluso&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; went on to term 'counter-mapping'

== Development ==

=== Neoliberalism ===
The development of counter-mapping can be situated within the [[neoliberal]] political-economic restructuring of the state.&lt;ref name=Leszcynski /&gt; Prior to the 1960s, equipping a map-making enterprise was chiefly the duty of a single agency, funded by the national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodchild|first=M,F|title=Virtual Geographic Environments as Collective Constructions|url=http://www.iseis.cuhk.edu.hk/downloads/vge/44.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2011|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, maps have conventionally been the products of privileged knowledges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=J.B|title=Deconstructing the Map|journal=Cartographica|year=1989|volume=26|issue=2|pages=1–20|doi=10.3138/e635-7827-1757-9t53}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, processes of [[neoliberalism]], predominantly since the late 1970s, have reconfigured the state's role in the cartographic project.&lt;ref name=Bryan /&gt; Neoliberalism denotes an emphasis on markets and minimal states, whereby individual choice is perceived to have replaced the mass-production of commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larner|first=W|title=Neoliberalism|year=2009|journal=International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography|pages=374–378}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that citizens are now performing cartographic functions that were once exclusively state-controlled can be partially explained through a shift from "roll-back neoliberalism", in which the state dismantled some of its functions, to "roll-out neoliberalism", in which new modes of operating have been constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peck|first=L|author2=Tickell,A|title=Neoliberalizing Space|journal=Antipode|year=2002|volume=34|pages=380–404|doi=10.1111/1467-8330.00247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In brief, the state can be seen to have "hollowed out" and delegated some of its [[map]]ping power to citizens.&lt;ref name="Jessop"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jessop|first=H|title=A Handbook of Comparative Social Policy|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|pages=11–27|editor=Kennett, P|chapter=Hollowing out the 'Nation-State' and Multi-Level Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Counter-mapping as Neoliberal Governmentality ====
[[Governmentality]] refers to a particular form of state power that is exercised when citizens self-discipline by acquiescing to state knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=M|author2=Knopp, L|title=Places and Polygons? Governmentality, Scale, and the Census in the Gay and Lesbian Atlas|year=2006|journal=Population, Space and Place|volume=12|pages=223–242|doi=10.1002/psp.410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, [[cartography]] has been a fundamental governmentality strategy,&lt;ref name="Crampton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Crampton|first=J|title=Mapping: A Critical Introduction to Cartography and GIS|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a technology of power, used for surveillance and control.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=J|title=Theorizing the State in Environmental Governance|journal=Review of International Political Economy|year=2006|volume=14|issue=1|pages=176–194|doi=10.1080/09692290601081244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competing claimants and boundaries made no appearance on state-led maps.&lt;ref name=McCarthy /&gt; This links to [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s&lt;ref name="Foucault"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=M|title=Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings:1972-1977|year=1988|publisher=Randon House|location=Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; notion of "subjugated knowledges" - ones that did not rise to the top, or were disqualified.&lt;ref name=Crampton /&gt; However, through neoliberalising processes, the state has retracted from performing some of its cartographic functions.&lt;ref name="Leszcynski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leszcynski|first=A|title=Situating the Geoweb in Political Economy|journal=Progress in Human Geography|year=2011|pages=1–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, rather than being passive recipients of top-down map distribution, people now have the opportunity to claim sovereignty over the mapping process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodge|first=M|author2=Perkins, P|title=Reclaiming the Map: British Geography and Ambivalent cartographic Practice|journal=Environment and Planning A|year=2008|volume=40|issue=6|pages=|doi=10.1068/a4172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this new regime of neoliberal cartographic governmentality the "insurrection of subjugated knowledges" occurs,&lt;ref name=Foucault /&gt; as counter-mapping initiatives incorporate previously marginalised voices.

=== Technological democratisation? ===
In response to technological change, predominantly since the 1980s, cartography has increasingly been democratised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rood|first=J |author2=Ormeling, F. |author3=van Elzakker, C|title=An Agenda for Democratising Cartographic Visualisation|journal=[[Norwegian Journal of Geography]]|volume=55|issue=1|pages=38–41|doi=10.1080/002919501300061427}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wide availability of high-quality location information has enabled mass-market cartography based on [[Global Positioning System]] receivers, home computers, and the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haklay|first=M|author2=Weber, P|title=OpenStreetMap: User-Generated Street Maps|journal=Pervasive Computing|year=2008|volume=1536|pages=12–18|doi=10.1109/mprv.2008.80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that civilians are using technologies which were once elitist led Brosius ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bosius|first=P.J|title=Communities and Conservation: Histories and Politics of Community-Based Natural Resource Management|year=2005|publisher=Rowman Altamira|location=London |author2=Tsing, A.L. |author3=Zerner, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to assert that counter-mapping involves "stealing the master's tools". Nevertheless, numerous early counter-mapping projects successfully utilised manual techniques, and many still use them. For instance, in recent years, the use of simple sketch mapping approaches has been revitalised, whereby maps are made on the ground, using natural materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poole|first=P|title=Geomatics: Who Needs it?|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|year=1995|volume=18|issue=4|pages=1–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the use of scale model constructions and felt boards, as means of representing cartographic claims of different groups, have become increasingly popular.&lt;ref name=Rocheleau /&gt; Consequently, [[Denis Wood|Wood]] ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; assert that counter-mappers can "make gateau out of technological crumbs".

==== Public Participation Geographical Information Systems ====
In recent years, [[Public Participation Geographical Information Systems]] (PPGIS) have attempted to take the power of the map out of the hands of the cartographic elite, putting it into the hands of the people. For instance, Kyem&lt;ref name="Kyem"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kyem|first=K|title=Promoting Local Community Participation in Forest Management Through the Application of a Geographical Information System: A PPGIS Experience from Southern Ghana|url=http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/varenius/ppgis/papers/kyem/kyem.html|accessdate=2011|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed a PPGIS method termed Exploratory Strategy for Collaboration, Management, Allocation, and Planning (ESCMAP). The method sought to integrate the concerns and experiences of three rural communities in the Ashanti Region of Ghana into official [[forest management]] practices.&lt;ref name=Kyem /&gt; Kyem&lt;ref name=Kyem /&gt; concluded that, notwithstanding  the potential of PPGIS, it is possible that the majority of the rich and powerful people in the area would object to some of the participatory uses of [[GIS]]. For example, loggers in Ghana affirmed that the PPGIS procedures were too open and democratic.&lt;ref name=Kyem /&gt; Thus, despite its democratising potential, there are barriers to its implementation. More recently, [[Denis Wood|Wood]] ''et al''.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt;  disputed the notion of PPGIS entirely, affirming that it is "scarcely [[GIS]], intensely hegemonic, hardly public, and anything but participatory".

== Counter-mapping as governance ==
[[Governance]] makes problematic state-centric notions of regulation, recognising that there has been a shift to power operating across several [[spatial scales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bridge|first=G|title=A Companion to Environmental Geography|year=2009|author2=Perreault, T|editor=Castree, N.M |editor2=Demeritt, D. |editor3=Liverman, D. |editor4=Rhoads, B|pages=475–497|chapter=Environmental Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, counter-mapping complicates state distribution of [[cartography]], advocating [[Top-down and bottom-up design#Management and organization|bottom-up]] participatory mapping projects (see [[GIS and environmental governance]]). Counter-mapping initiatives, often without state assistance, attempt to exert power. As such, counter-mapping conforms to [[Bob Jessop|Jessop]]'s&lt;ref name=Jessop /&gt; notion of "governance without government". Another characteristic of governance is its "purposeful effort to steer, control or manage sectors or facets of society" towards a common goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kooiman|first=J|title=Modern Governance. New Government-Society Interactions|year=1993|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, as maps exude power and authority,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colchester|first=M|title=Communities and Conservation: Histories and Politics of Community-Based Natural Resource Management|year=2005|publisher=Rowman Altamira|location=London|pages=271–304|editor=Brosius, P.J. |editor2=Tsing, A.L. |editor3=Zerner, C|chapter=Maps, Power, and the Defense of Territory: The Upper Mazarini Land Claim in Guyana}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are a trusted medium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Markham|first=B|title=West with the Night|year=1983|publisher=North Point Press|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the ability to 'steer' society in a particular direction. In brief, [[cartography]], once the tool of kings and governments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=D|title=The Power of Maps|year=1992|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; is now being used as a tool of governance - to advocate policy change from the [[grassroots]].&lt;ref name="Alcorn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alcorn|first=J.B|title=Borders, Rules and Governance: Mapping to Catalyse Changes in Policy and Management|year=2000|publisher=Gatekeeper Series|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental sphere is one context in which counter-mapping has been utilised as a governance tool.&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt;

=== Counter-mapping as environmental governance ===
In contrast to expert knowledges, lay knowledges are increasingly valuable to decision-makers, in part due to the scientific uncertainty surrounding environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J|title=Environmental Governance|year=2012|publisher=Taylor Francis|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Participatory]] counter-mapping projects are an effective means of incorporating lay knowledges&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Narayan|first=P|title=Empowerment through Participation: How Effective is this Approach?|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|year=2003|volume=38|issue=25|pages=21–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; into issues surrounding [[environmental governance]]. For instance, counter-maps depicting traditional use of areas now protected for biodiversity have been used to allow resource use, or to promote public debate about the issue, rather than forcing relocation.&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt; For example, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] used the results of counter-mapping to advocate for the reclassification of several strictly protected areas into Indonesian national parks, including Kayan Mentarang and Gunung Lorentz.&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt; The success of such counter-mapping efforts led Alcorn&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt;  to affirm that [[governance]] ([[grassroots]] mapping projects), rather than government ([[wikt:top-down|top-down]] map distribution), offers the best hope for good [[natural resource management]]. In short, it can be seen that "maps are powerful political tools in ecological and governance discussions".&lt;ref name=Alcorn /&gt;

== Types of counter-mapping ==
Numerous counter-mapping types exist, for instance: protest maps, map art, counter-mapping for conservation, and [[PPGIS]]. In order to emphasise the wide scope of what has come to be known as counter-mapping, three contrasting counter-mapping examples are elucidated in this section: indigenous counter-mapping, community mapping, and state counter-mapping, respectively.

=== Indigenous counter-mapping ===
Counter-mapping has been undertaken most in the Third World.&lt;ref name="perkins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=C|title=Community Mapping|journal=The Cartographic Journal|volume=44|issue=2|pages=127–137|doi=10.1179/000870407x213440}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indigenous peoples]] are increasingly turning to [[participatory]] mapping, appropriating both the state's techniques and manner of representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wainwright|first=J|author2=Bryan, J|title=Cartography, Territory, Property: Postcolonial Reflections on Indigenous Counter-Mapping in Nicaragua and Belize|journal=Cultural Geographies|year=2009|volume=16|pages=153–187|doi=10.1177/1474474008101515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-mapping is a tool for indigenous identity-building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=J.J|title=Naming the Land: San Countermapping in Namibia's West Caprivi|journal=Geoforum|year=2008|volume=39|issue=5|pages=1766–1775|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2008.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for bolstering the legitimacy of customary resource claims.&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt; The success of counter-mapping in realising indigenous claims can be seen through Nietschmann's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neitschmann|first=B|title=Defending the Misiko Reefs with Maps and GIS: Mapping with Sail, Scuba and Satellite|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|year=1995|volume=18|issue=4|pages=34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; assertion:

|align  = left
|bgcolor =#FFF8E7

}}
{{clear}}

==== Creation of Nunavut ====
The power of indigenous counter-mapping can be exemplified through the creation of [[Nunavut]]. In 1967, [[Frank Arthur Calder]] and the Nisaga'a Nation Tribal Council brought an action against the [[Province of British Columbia]] for a declaration that [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] title to specified land had not been lawfully extinguished. In 1973, the [[Canadian Supreme Court]] found that there was, in fact, an aboriginal title. The Canadian government attempted to extinguish such titles by negotiating [[treaties]] with the people who had not signed them.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; As a first step, the [[Inuit Tapirisat of Canada]] studied [[Inuit]] land occupancy in the Arctic, resulting in the publication of the ''Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freeman|first=M.M.R|title=Land Use and Occupancy, Vol. 1 of Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project Report|year=1976|location=Ottawa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diverse interests, such as those of hunters, trappers, fishermen and berry-pickers mapped out the land they had used during their lives.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; As Usher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Usher|first=P.J|title=Environment, Race and Nation Reconsidered: Reflections on Aboriginal Land Claims in Canada|journal=Canadian Geographer|year=2003|volume=47|issue=4|pages=365–382|doi=10.1111/j.0008-3658.2003.00029.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted:

{{quote box |quote = ''We were no longer mapping the 'territories' of Aboriginal people based on the cumulative observations of others of where they were…but instead, mapping the Aboriginal peoples’ own recollections of their own activities''.
|align  = left
|bgcolor =#FFF8E7
 |quoted = 1
}}

These maps played a fundamental role in the negotiations that enabled the Inuit to assert an aboriginal title to the 2 million km² in Canada, today known as Nunavut.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; Evidently, counter-mapping is a tool by which indigenous groups can re-present the world in ways which destabilise dominant representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kwan|first=M|title=Feminist Visualisation: Re-Envisioning GIS as a Method in Feminist Geographic Research|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=92|issue=4|pages=645–661|doi=10.1111/1467-8306.00309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community mapping ===
[[Community]] mapping can be defined as: "local mapping, produced collaboratively, by local people and often incorporating alternative
local knowledge".&lt;ref name=perkins /&gt; [http://www.openstreetmap.org/ OpenStreetMap] is an example of a community mapping initiative, with the potential to counter the hegemony of state-dominated map distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elwood|first=S|title=Citizen Cartographies and the Shifting Politics of Expertise. Paper Presented at the 24th Annual International Cartography Conference|year=2009|location=Santiago, Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== OpenStreetMap ====
[[File:OpenStreetMap homepage 2018 en.png|thumb|"border"text-topalt=OpenStreetMap home page.|OpenStreetMap home page.]]
[[OpenStreetMap]] (OSM), a citizen-led spatial data collection website, was founded by [[Steve Coast]] in 2004. Data are collected from diverse public domain sources; of which [[GPS]] tracks are the most important, collected by volunteers with GPS receivers.&lt;ref name=perkins /&gt;  {{as of|2011|January|10}} there were 340,522 registered OSM users, who had uploaded 2.121 billion GPS points onto the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkins, C|title=Review OSM: Using and Enhancing the Free Map of the World by Ramm, F., Topf, J and Chilton, S.|year=2011|publisher=(in press)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of map creation explicitly relies upon sharing and participation; consequently, every registered OSM user can edit any part of the map. Moreover, 'map parties' - social events which aim to fill gaps in coverage, help foster a community ethos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=C|author2=Dodge, M|title=The Potential of User-Generated Cartography: A Case Study of the OpenStreetMap Project and Mapchester Mapping Party|journal=North West Geography|year=2008|volume=8|issue=1|pages=19–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, the [[grassroots]] OSM project can be seen to represent a [[paradigm shift]] in who creates and shares geographic information - from the state, to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elwood|first=S |author2=Goodchild, M.F |author3=Sui, D.Z|title=Researching VGI: Spatial Data, Geographic Research and New Social Practice|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|year=2011|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/00045608.2011.595657}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, rather than countering the state-dominated cartographic project, some commentators have affirmed that OSM merely replicates the 'old' socio-economic order.&lt;ref name="Haklay"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haklay|first=M|title=How Good is Volunteered Geographical Information? A Comparative Study of OpenStreetMap and Ordnance Survey Datasets|journal=Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design|year=2008|volume=37|pages=682–703|doi=10.1068/b35097}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Haklay&lt;ref name=Haklay /&gt; affirmed that OSM users in the United Kingdom tend not to map council estates; consequently, middle-class areas are disproportionately mapped. Thus, in opposition to notions that OSM is a radical cartographic counter-culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kent|first=A.J|title=Cartographic Blandscapes and the New Noise: Finding the Good View in a Topographical Mashup|journal=SoC Bulletin|year=2008|volume=42|pages=29–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; are contentions that OSM "simply recreates a mirror copy of existing [[topographic mapping]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodge|first=M|title=Rethinking Maps: New Frontiers in Cartographic Theory|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London |author2=Perkins, C. |author3=Kitchin, R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State counter-mapping ===
What has come to be known as counter-mapping is not limited to the activities of [[Stateless nation|non-state]] actors within a particular nation-state; relatively weak states also engage in counter-mapping in an attempt to challenge other states.&lt;ref name="Nevins"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nevins|first=J|title=Contesting the Boundaries of International Justice: State Countermapping and Offshore Resource Struggles Between East-Timor and Australia|journal=Economic Geography|year=2004|volume=80|issue=1|pages=470–484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Competing cartographic representations: East Timor versus Australia ====
[[East Timor]]'s on-going effort to gain control of gas and oil resources from Australia, which it perceives at its own, is a form of counter-mapping. This dispute involves a cartographic contestation of Australia's mapping of the seabed resources between the two countries.&lt;ref name=Nevins /&gt; As Nevins&lt;ref name=Nevins /&gt; contends: whilst Australia's map is based on the status quo - a legacy of a 1989 agreement between Australia and the Indonesian occupier of East Timor at that time, East Timor's map represents an enlarged notion of what its sea boundaries should be, thereby entailing a redrawing of the map. This form of counter-mapping thus represents a claim by a relatively weak state, East Timor, to territory and resources that are controlled by a stronger state, Australia.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt; However, Nevins&lt;ref name=Nevins /&gt; notes that there is limited potential of realising a claim through East Timor's counter-map: counter-mapping is an effective strategy only when combined with broader legal and political strategies.&lt;ref name=Nevins /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Counter-mapping's claim to incorporate counter-knowledges, and thereby empower traditionally disempowered people, has not gone uncontested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turow|first=J|title=Playing Doctor: Television, Storytelling, and Medical Power|year=2010|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sample of criticisms leveled at counter-mapping:

* Counter-mapping fails to recognise that community is a constantly shifting, fluid process, too often relying on a notion of community as bounded and fixed. As such, the process of mapping communicates and naturalises who does, and who does not, belong within particular boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kosek|first=J|title=Mapping Politics|journal=Quarterly Publication of the International Association for the Study of Common Property|year=1998|volume=45|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Due to the power imbalance between [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] claims and those of the state, the language and tools of the dominant society must be used by those under its control. The process of using another's tools can change the ideas represented, resulting in a map of unpredictable quality.&lt;ref name=Rundstrom /&gt;
* Counter-mapping is in danger of becoming the 'thing to do'; a "magic bullet applied uncritically".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=J|title=Mapping Communities: Ethics, Values, Practice|year=2005|publisher=East-West Center|location=Hawaii |author2=Suryanata, K. |author3=Hershock, P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is a geography to the success of counter-mapping. In Tibet, counter-mapping is of limited political utility as [[mapmaking]] is not enfranchised and cannot be scaled up, for instance, to settle legal battles over land tenure and resource rights through the regulatory offices of the state.&lt;ref name=Bauer /&gt;
* Counter-mapping projects utilising [[GIS]] require significant knowledge and [[computer literacy]] above that of lay individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milla|first=K.A |author2=Lorenzo, A. |author3=Brown,C|title=GIS, GPS, and Remote Sensing Technologies in Extension Services: Where to Start, What to Know|journal=Extension Journal|year=2005|volume=43|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Investment in specialised computers and software often results in prohibitive mapping costs for a large majority of local people, particularly in poor areas. As some groups prove more capable of adopting the technologies than others, counter-mapping projects can deepen divisions within communities along gender and economic lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corbett|first=J.M |author2=Chaplin, L. |author3=Gibson, G.R|title=Indigenous Mapping|journal=International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography|year=2009|pages=377–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To summarise, whilst counter-mapping has the potential to transform map-making from "a science of princes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harley|first=J.B|title=Silences and Secrecy: The Hidden Agenda of Cartography in Early Modern Europe|journal=Imago Mundi, Ltd|year=1988|volume=40|pages=57–76|doi=10.1080/03085698808592639}}&lt;/ref&gt; the investment required to create a map with the ability to challenge state-produced cartography means that counter-mapping is unlikely to become a "science of the masses".&lt;ref name=Peluso /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15021">In [[logic]], a true/false [[decision problem]] is '''decidable''' if there exists an [[effective method]] for deriving the correct answer (instead of looping indefinitely, crashing, returning "don't know", or returning a wrong answer). [[Formal system|Logical system]]s such as [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] are decidable if membership in their set of [[Validity (logic)|logically valid]] formulas (or theorems) can be effectively determined. A [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] (set of sentences [[Deductive closure|closed]] under [[logical consequence]]) in a fixed logical system is decidable if there is an effective method for determining whether arbitrary formulas are included in the theory. Many important problems are [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], that is, it has been proven that no effective method for determining membership (returning a correct answer after finite, though possibly very long, time in all cases) can exist for them.

==Relationship to computability==

As with the concept of a [[decidable set]], the definition of a decidable theory or logical system can be given either in terms of ''[[effective method]]s'' or in terms of ''[[computable function]]s''. These are generally considered equivalent per [[Church's thesis]]. Indeed, the proof that a logical system or theory is undecidable will use the formal definition of computability to show that an appropriate set is not a decidable set, and then invoke Church's thesis to show that the theory or logical system is not decidable by any effective method (Enderton 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;206''ff.'').

==Decidability of a logical system==

Each [[logical system]] comes with both a [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic component]], which among other things determines the notion of [[formal proof|provability]], and a [[Formal semantics (logic)|semantic component]], which determines the notion of [[logical validity]]. The logically valid formulas of a system are sometimes called the '''theorems''' of the system, especially in the context of first-order logic where [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] establishes the equivalence of semantic and syntactic consequence. In other settings, such as [[linear logic]], the syntactic consequence (provability) relation may be used to define the theorems of a system.

A logical system is decidable if there is an effective method for determining whether arbitrary formulas are theorems of the logical system. For example, [[propositional logic]] is decidable, because the [[truth table|truth-table]] method can be used to determine whether an arbitrary [[propositional formula]] is logically valid.

[[First-order logic]] is not decidable in general; in particular, the set of logical validities in any [[signature (logic)|signature]] that includes equality and at least one other predicate with two or more arguments is not decidable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Boris Trakhtenbrot|Trakhtenbrot]], 1953&lt;/ref&gt; Logical systems extending first-order logic, such as [[second-order logic]] and [[type theory]], are also undecidable.

The validities of [[monadic predicate calculus]] with identity are decidable, however. This system is first-order logic restricted to signatures that have no function symbols and whose relation symbols other than equality never take more than one argument.

Some logical systems are not adequately represented by the set of theorems alone. (For example, [[ternary logic|Kleene's logic]] has no theorems at all.) In such cases, alternative definitions of decidability of a logical system are often used, which ask for an effective method for determining something more general than just validity of formulas; for instance, validity of [[sequent]]s, or the [[logical consequence|consequence relation]] {(Г, ''A'') | Г ⊧ ''A''} of the logic.

==Decidability of a theory==

A [[theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] is a set of formulas, which here is assumed to be closed under [[logical consequence]]. The question of decidability for a theory is whether there is an effective procedure that, given an arbitrary formula in the signature of the theory, decides whether the formula is a member of the theory or not. This problem arises naturally when a theory is defined as the set of logical consequences of a fixed set of axioms. Examples of decidable first-order theories include the theory of [[real closed field]]s, and [[Presburger arithmetic]], while the theory of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[Robinson arithmetic]] are examples of undecidable theories.

There are several basic results about decidability of theories. Every inconsistent theory is decidable, as every formula in the signature of the theory will be a logical consequence of, and thus a member of, the theory. Every [[complete theory|complete]] [[recursively enumerable]] first-order theory is decidable. An extension of a decidable theory may not be decidable. For example, there are undecidable theories in propositional logic, although the set of validities (the smallest theory) is decidable.

A consistent theory that has the property that every consistent extension is undecidable is said to be '''essentially undecidable'''. In fact, every consistent extension will be essentially undecidable. The theory of fields is undecidable but not essentially undecidable. [[Robinson arithmetic]] is known to be essentially undecidable, and thus every consistent theory that includes or interprets Robinson arithmetic is also (essentially) undecidable.

==Some decidable theories==

Some decidable theories include (Monk 1976, p.&amp;nbsp;234):&lt;ref name=Monk1976 /&gt;
* The set of first-order logical validities in the signature with only equality, established by [[Leopold Löwenheim]] in 1915.

==In context of games==
Some [[games]] have been classified as to their decidability:
* [[Chess]] is decidable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/47722/q-is-chess-game-movement-tm-decidable http://cs.stackexchange.com/Computer Science. "Is chess game movement TM decidable?"] Is chess game movement TM decidable?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.redhotpawn.com/forum/posers-and-puzzles/undecidable-chess-problem.90513 https://www.redhotpawn.com/Undecidable chess problem?] Undecidable chess problem?&lt;/ref&gt;  The same holds for all other finite two-player games with perfect information.
* Mate in ''n'' in [[infinite chess]] (with limitations on rules and gamepieces) is decidable.&lt;ref name="Decidability"&gt;[http://mathoverflow.net/questions/27967/decidability-of-chess-on-an-infinite-board/63684 Mathoverflow.net/Decidability-of-chess-on-an-infinite-board] Decidability-of-chess-on-an-infinite-board.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mate in N"&gt;Dan Brumleve, Joel David Hamkins, Philipp Schlicht, The Mate-in-n Problem of Infinite Chess Is Decidable, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Volume 7318, 2012, pp. 78-88, Springer [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-30870-3_9], available at [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.5597v4 arXiv].&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are positions (with finitely many pieces) that are forced wins, but not mate in ''n'' for any finite ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/63423/checkmate-in-omega-moves&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some team games with imperfect information on a finite board (but with unlimited time) are undecidable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/sampler.pdf http://www-math.mit.edu/Undecidable Problems: A Sampler, Bjorn Poonen] Undecidable Problems: A Sampler, Bjorn Poonen (Section 14.1, "Abstract games").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some undecidable theories==
Some undecidable theories include (Monk 1976, p.&amp;nbsp;279):&lt;ref name=Monk1976&gt;{{cite book|author =Donald Monk | year = 1976| title =Mathematical Logic| publisher =Springer-Verlag |isbn=9780387901701}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The set of logical validities in any first-order signature with equality and either: a relation symbol of arity no less than 2, or two unary function symbols, or one function symbol of arity no less than 2, established by [[Boris Trakhtenbrot|Trakhtenbrot]] in 1953.
* The first-order theory of the natural numbers with addition, multiplication, and equality, established by Tarski and [[Andrzej Mostowski]] in 1949.
* The first-order theory of the rational numbers with addition, multiplication, and equality, established by [[Julia Robinson]] in 1949.
* The first-order theory of groups, established by [[Alfred Tarski]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1=Tarski| first1=A. | last2=Mostovski| first2=A. | last3=Robinson| first3=R. |  title=Undecidable Theories | publisher=North-Holland, Amsterdam | series=Studies in Logic and the Foundation of Mathematics | year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Remarkably, not only the general theory of groups is undecidable, but also several more specific theories, for example (as established by Mal'cev 1961)  the theory of finite groups. Mal'cev also established that the theory of semigroups and the theory of rings are undecidable. Robinson established in 1949 that the theory of fields is undecidable.
* [[Robinson arithmetic]] (and therefore any consistent extension, such as [[Peano arithmetic]]) is essentially undecidable, as established by [[Raphael Robinson]] in 1950.
* The first-order theory with equality and two function symbols&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gurevich |first=Yuri |date=1976 |title= The Decision Problem for Standard Classes|url=http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/journals/jsyml/Gurevich76 |journal= J. Symb. Log.|publisher= |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=460–464 |doi= |access-date=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[interpretability]] method is often used to establish undecidability of theories. If an essentially undecidable theory ''T'' is interpretable in a consistent theory ''S'', then ''S'' is also essentially undecidable. This is closely related to the concept of a [[many-one reduction]] in computability theory.

==Semidecidability==

A property of a theory or logical system weaker than decidability is '''semidecidability'''.  A theory is semidecidable if there is an effective method which, given an arbitrary formula, will always tell correctly when the formula is in the theory, but may give either a negative answer or no answer at all when the formula is not in the theory. A logical system is semidecidable if there is an effective method for generating theorems (and only theorems) such that every theorem will eventually be generated. This is different from decidability because in a semidecidable system there may be no effective procedure for checking that a formula is ''not'' a theorem.

Every decidable theory or logical system is semidecidable, but in general the converse is not true; a theory is decidable if and only if both it and its complement are semi-decidable. For example, the  set of logical validities ''V'' of first-order logic is semi-decidable, but not decidable. In this case, it is because there is no effective method for determining for an arbitrary formula ''A'' whether ''A'' is not in ''V''. Similarly, the set of logical consequences of any [[recursively enumerable set]] of first-order axioms is semidecidable. Many of the examples of undecidable first-order theories given above are of this form.

==Relationship with completeness==

Decidability should not be confused with [[complete theory|completeness]]. For example, the theory of [[algebraically closed field]]s is decidable but incomplete, whereas the set of all true first-order statements about nonnegative integers in the language with + and &amp;times; is complete but undecidable. 
Unfortunately, as a terminological ambiguity, the term "undecidable statement" is sometimes used as a synonym for [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent statement]].

'''Demand flow technology''' ('''DFT''') is a strategy for defining and deploying business processes in a flow, driven in response to customer demand.  DFT is based on a set of applied mathematical tools that are used to connect processes in a flow and link it to daily changes in demand.
DFT represents a scientific approach to flow manufacturing for discrete production.  It is built on principles of demand pull where customer demand is the central signal to guide factory and office activity in the daily operation.  DFT is intended to provide an alternative to schedule-push manufacturing which primarily uses a sales plan and forecast to determine a production schedule.

==History==
It was created by John R. Costanza, an executive with operations management experience at [[Hewlett Packard]] and [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;Fortune Magazine (2000).  Heroes of U.S. Manufacturing, 20 March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Costanza, who was later nominated as a Nobel Laureate in Economics ( this is not true, he is not on nobel laureat list for economics) for Working Capital Management, founded the John Costanza Institute of Technology in Englewood, CO in 1984 to provide consulting and education services for manufacturers to implement the methodology.

DFT uses applied mathematical methods to link raw and in-process materials with units of time and production resources in order to create a continuous flow in the factory.  The objective is to link factory processes together in a flow and drive it to customer demand instead of to an internal forecast that is inherently inaccurate.

Early adopters of DFT included [[American Standard Companies]]&lt;ref name="E. Kampouris, Long Range Planning pp. 82-95"&gt;"Transforming productivity in multinational manufacture using demand flow technology," with E. Kampouris, Long Range Planning, Vol. 27, no. 6, pp. 82–95, December 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fortune Magazine (1994). PROPHET OF ZERO WORKING CAPITAL. 13 June 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Bossidy]]; [[Ram Charan]] (2004) Confronting Reality. p203. {{ISBN|1-4000-5084-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[General Electric]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Bossidy]]; [[Ram Charan]] (2002) Execution. p65. {{ISBN|0-609-61057-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John Deere ([[Deere &amp; Company]]).

In the early years, DFT was regarded as a method for "[[Just in time (business)|just-in-time]]" (JIT), which advocated manufacturing processes driven to actual customer demand via [[Kanban]].  It was introduced as a way for American manufacturers to adopt Japanese production techniques, such as [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS), whilst avoiding some of the cultural conflicts in applying Japanese business methods in an American company.  Later, it has come to be seen as a [[lean manufacturing]] method that allows factories to implement techniques such as one-piece flow, TAKT-based line design, [[Kanban]] material management and demand-driven production.

Demand Flow Technology is promoted as a method particularly suitable for high-mix, low-volume manufacturing.  in 2001, Costanza was awarded a patent for this approach for mixed-model manufacturing.&lt;ref name="Costanza, John R. 1996 pp. 1-352"&gt;Costanza, John R., "The Quantum Leap In Speed To Market", John Costanza Institute of Technology, Inc. (1996). pp. 1–352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;US Patent 6198980 – System and method for designing a mixed-model manufacturing process, 6 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

===Demand-driven manufacturing===

The central tenet to DFT is the primacy of customer demand in daily execution of the operation.  According to Aberdeen Group,

:"Demand driven manufacturing involves a synchronized, closed loop between customer orders, production scheduling, and manufacturing execution; all while simultaneously coordinating the flow of materials across the supply chain." [Aberdeen Group, 2007].&lt;ref&gt;"How to achieve best in class demand-driven manufacturing", http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2008/01/how_to_achieve_best_in_class_demand_driven_manufacturing.html&lt;/ref&gt;

DFT is a pathway to achieve demand-driven manufacturing capability.  It is used as a framework to guide the design, implementation and deployment of demand driven manufacturing in a repeatable form.  In this way, it is similar original concept of Just-in-Time (JIT) that was first deployed in Japanese manufacturers using a foundation of total quality management.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Walton. (1986). “The Deming Management Method”, page 75, {{ISBN|0-399-55000-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, [[Just in time (business)|Just-in-time]] has been more commonly used to describe supplier delivery methods, rather than a production philosophy.  DFT assumes basic process capability that can arise from TQM and [[statistical process control]] (SPC) principles and embeds it in a framework of management that can more easily achieve demand driven in a repeatable way.

As a result, In-Progress and Finished inventories are all but eliminated, converted permanently into cash at full market value through much faster response to customer orders.

Cash released from Working Capital in this way no longer has to be reinvested in inventory. It becomes available to retire debt, fund growth and innovation.

===Mixed-model production===

[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/mixed-model-production.html Mixed-model production] is the production of a wide range of product models using a certain degree of shared resources and common material.  It is commonly accepted that modern manufacturing places a greater pressure on producers for more choice in the product offering.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Anderson.  (2006). “The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More”. {{ISBN|1-4013-0237-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products are increasingly assembled from standard components and sub-assemblies, using machines and automated systems as well as manual labour.  DFT is designed to handle this mix and provide a way to establish mixed-model production lines.

A [[production schedule]] based on MRP will tend to cope with high product mix by allocating each model to a multiple of a shift or a day.  This means that the whole product mix is supplied across a scheduling cycle of a multiple of weeks.  This tends to extend the lead-time or increase dependency on the forecast.  DFT offers “The ability to accommodate a range of volumes for any product, any day, based on the direction of actual customer demand”.&lt;ref name="Costanza, John R. 1996 pp. 1-352"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Product synchronization===

The first tool to be used in a DFT implementation, product synchronization is a definition of relationship of processes in a flow to build a product.  It takes the form of a diagram, usually created in pen and paper or whiteboard and formalized with a visualization program such as Microsoft PowerPoint or Visio.  It displays how the processes relate to each other in a flow, with the conversion of raw material to finished goods.  A process is defined by "A logical grouping of value-adding work performed to a common volume".

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Product Synch.JPG]] --&gt;

===Sequence of events (SoE)===

Each of the processes in the product synchronization requires a standard process definition.  In DFT, the sequence of events provides this definition.  In ''The Quantum Leap'', written by Costanza,&lt;ref&gt;John R. Costanza (2005).  The Quantum Leap: Next Generation {{ISBN|1-932159-44-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sequence of events is defined as "[t]he definition of the required work and quality criteria to build a product in a specific production process."
The SoE usually takes the form of a table with the product code, process ID, task description and sequence, required work and set-up time for machines and labour, and quality check criteria.  The SoE intends to define times that are reasonable, realistic and repeatable to perform to the necessary quality.  Many of the strengths and criticisms of DFT as a methodology stem from the SoE.  The SoEs are the foundation of process definition but are not used as work instructions.  To communicate standard work at the work center, operation method sheets are used.
In an MRP systems environment, the SoE represents a drill-down from the routing that provides a tabular view of the Product Synchronization at the process level.  A DFT manufacturer would therefore use the SoE as the master record of process definition and derive routings and ISO documentation from it.

===Operation method sheets===

These are visual description of work in motion, materials and the required quality check.  In the purest form, operation method sheets are drawn in [[wire-frame model|wire-frame]] to show the significant contours of the product form and clearly represent work in motion and quality without visual noise.  The OMS has three stages of activity: total quality check, work, and verify.  This establishes the concept where each operator checks the output quality of the operation immediately upstream.  This can contribute to a total quality culture and parts-per-million capability.

===Mixed-model process map===

The sequence of events and product synchronization define how tasks and quality check compose the process for any given product.  The mixed-model process map shows how products and processes form a requirement for resources.  In such a map, the products and processes form a matrix with products as rows and processes as columns.  At the intersection are most commonly actual times (standard times at the process from the sequence of events), but could also display yield and optionality ratios.

===Demand at capacity===

Demand at capacity is the volume of production for a single product item at capacity.  It is a fixed value that defines the maximum daily rate of supply.  The Demand-at-Capacity is often confused with the daily rate of production.  In contrast to [[Toyota Production System]], and many other lean manufacturing derivatives, a DFT line is designed for variable output rates according to daily demand.  Thus, the demand data that are used for line design represent a limit quantity not an actual rate of supply.  The relationship between the Dc and the average daily demand will be driven by the required service level of the product item to market demand.  A higher service level will call for capacity that can supply a higher daily rate than the average over a long range.  This will likely affect the [[resource productivity]] and inventory levels.  A greater mix on the line is able to provide a higher level of service for any given level of resources and inventory.

===Effective hours===

The effective hours is the time available for a given resource to produce product or perform process set-up or changeover.  It is defined per shift and represents the total available time to perform tasks set in the SoE.  Non-productive time such as equipment maintenance, breaks, 5S activity and continuous improvement is deducted from effective hours.  Setup time is included as it is arguably a form of productive time and calculations for batch size optimization and dynamic Kanban will require setup and run-time to be managed from a common pool of resource time.

===Takt &amp; Operational Cycle-Time, OP c/t===

Takt-time is the ratio of time to volume at capacity and in DFT is expressed as

Where HE is Effective Hours, S is the number of shifts and DC is the demand at capacity, a daily rate set for design purposes at some point 2 to 5 years into the future.  This ratio can be expressed for finished products at the end of the line and is referred to as Takt-Time.  It can also apply at the process where bill of material relationships, process yield and optionality can affect the dependent volume for any given Dc at the finished goods level.  At the process level, this ratio is known as operational cycle-time.

Takt time is typically used to calculate the "line design" or number and disposition of physical resources required to produce a given mix and volume of products that changes on a daily basis according to customer demand.

Uniquely to DFT Takt time is constant, based on a fixed mix and product volume which is set for factory design purposes 2 to 5 years into the future. This allows for a stable "line design" that does not need to change on a daily basis. Daily changes in mix and volume are accommodated in DFT by adjusting the number of people working in production. Those not required to meet the Daily Rate (Dr) are free to spend quality time in training and continuous improvement activities.

Weekly scheduling cycles to achieve level-loading of mix and volume, which cause significant planning delays, are eliminated. It becomes possible to produce any product on any day in response to real customer demand making possible a true Demand Flow.

As a result, In-Progress and Finished inventories are all but eliminated, converted permanently into cash at full market value through much faster response to customer orders.

Cash released from Working Capital in this way no longer has to be reinvested in inventory. It becomes available to retire debt, fund growth and innovation etc.

===Material Kanban===

DFT shares a conventional definition of material [[Kanban]] based on a visual signal to replenish a point of consumption with required material.  A typical material Kanban system in DFT is "Single Card, Multiple Container" and enables card or container quantities to be consumed and replenished without shortages.

Material Kanban provides an alternative to kitting as a way of issuing material to the production floor.  A DFT environment will strive to simplify the definition of [[warehouse]] locations for material and reduce the number of transactions required to control the flow of material during production.  The aim of Material Kanban is to connect the material flow with actual requirement at the process and provide a more robust availability of parts to production whilst reducing the response-time to the customer.

===Production Kanban===

Production Kanban is designed for a replenishment quantity that may be smaller than a lot size or batch.  It is based on a "dual card Kanban" system where a "move" card or container represents the quantity required by the downstream point of consumption and a "produce" card is kept on a display board and accumulates to a replenishment batch.

===Demand-based management===

Demand-based management is an approach that defines tolerance capability for demand in order to unify material and [[production planning]] under conditions of demand uncertainty.  It uses "flex fences" to set the upper and lower boundaries of supply against a definition of the current daily rate of demand.  The current rate is usually some kind of [[average|smoothed average]] and will move over time.  The flex-fences will be different for different product items or groups and should be calculated individually.  Order policies, purchasing, inventory and production capacity will all be set against these flex fence boundaries, so these calculations will sit at the heart of [[Planning|operations planning]].

Unfortunately, this is a calculation-intensive and critical process that is largely unsupported by [[Manufacturing resource planning|MRP]]/[[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] systems.  The lack of system tools and clash with conventional MRP planning routine are primary reason why demand-based management has not had the same level of adoption experienced by the rest of the DFT principles.

==Value and results==

Companies that implement DFT are typically looking for an improvement in the response to customer demand.  This is reflected in the lead-time or replenishment time for finished product and will affect the level of inventory that is held to buffer response requirements.
Effective response to demand can be described as a distribution curve, with some orders taking longer to fill than others.  The result is variation and uncertainty in the manufacturer’s ability to serve the market.  [[Working capital]] is required to hedge this response lag and uncertainty.

DFT aims to reduce both the variation and duration of response to demand.  This can be seen as a more capable fulfillment that provides a higher level of customer service at a lower level of working capital.  The intended results are improvement in delivery performance together with increased [[cash-flow]] and return on working capital.

==Applications==

Demand flow technology is applicable in a wide range of product environments and has been successfully deployed in many different industries.  Companies who have embraced demand flow technology include [[John Deere]],&lt;ref&gt;Demand Flow Technology, Not Just a Manufacturing Strategy, YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWfKpJTLK7U&amp;feature=youtube_gdata&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="STANLEY-WORKS-Mar-1997-10-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/210/95013697000279/filing-main.htm |title=STANLEY WORKS, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Mar 19, 1997 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Stanleyworks (1996). Form 10-K&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flextronics]], [[American Standard Companies]],&lt;ref name="E. Kampouris, Long Range Planning pp. 82-95"/&gt; [[Trane]], [[AstraZeneca]] and many others.  It has a strength in those manufacturing operations that are expected to supply a high mix to an unpredictable and volatile market.  It is often seen as the science behind flow manufacturing for discrete manufacturers, whose products do not naturally flow across the manufacturing processes.

==Advantages and criticisms==

===Advantages===

====It is simple====
Demand flow technology provides a simple, logical method based on applied mathematics.  The technique is based on simple operators of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division so it does not rely on advanced mathematics.

====It is repeatable====
DFT forms a step-by-step guide to converting production from a scheduled-push to a demand-pull and flow system.  Although it is applicable to a wide range of products, the steps are consistent and work in the same way.  It does not depend on the judgment of an expert in the same way as lean or Six Sigma and can be taught to a broader audience though short training workshops.

====It is effective====
At its heart, DFT formalizes the natural flow of material, processes and information required to build a product.  It is not so much an invented technology as a description of the optimal way to align a factory towards customer demand.

====It is customer-centric====
DFT places the customer at the center of the operation.  It enables companies to formalise a customer-centric view with practical tasks and actions that guide behaviour in the organisation.  It moves the concept of [[customer-driven]] to an achievable plan of action beyond a statement of philosophy.

====It aligns business and customer goals====
The concept of maximizing shareholder value is often seen as a conflict with the quality of customer service.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Welch.  (2009) Welch condemns share price focus, Financial Times, 12 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Demand Flow Technology, if applied correctly, can unify financial and customer objectives in a holistic approach to managing operating capital and growing a business.

===Criticisms===

====It is constrained to the factory====
Demand flow techniques have been widely applied to the factory, yet have failed to gain widespread acceptance in corporate management.  All too often, it tends to be limited to production planning whilst operations and material planning continue to be dominated by use of ERP/MRP systems.  The holistic ideal of demand flow may be fractured by this conflict.

====It is unsupported by systems====
Major ERP/MRP vendors have largely ignored the advantages of Demand Flow techniques, or been acquired before their products have had a chance to gain market share.  The advocates and users of Demand Flow have largely failed to challenge the inadequate logic that conventional MRP uses for planning [[capacity planning|capacity]] and [[capacity planning|production resources]] &lt;ref&gt;Mabert, Vincent A. (2006) The early road to material requirements planning, The Journal of Operations Management.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pochet, Yves. Wolsey, Laurence A. (2000).  Production planning by mixed integer programming.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, manufacturers are forced to rely on an outdated routine for planning that is largely unchanged since the 1960s.

====It requires process definition and discipline====
DFT aims to apply a standard process definition of product to daily requirements of demand.  This favours processes that are capable and defined to the task level.  This is sometimes a level of detail and discipline absent from the organisation.  The creation and maintenance of Sequence of Events documentation involves extensive manual work.  There are powerful advantages to quality and capability in performing this work, but success usually depends on management commitment to change beyond the narrow actions of a DFT implementation.

'''Ekaggatā''' (Pali; Sanskrit ''[[Ekagrata|ekāgratā]]'', एकाग्रता) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "unification of awareness" or "one-pointedness." It is a [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factor]] that has the function to focus on an object.{{source?|date=November 2018}}

''Ekaggatā'' is identified within the Buddhist teachings as:
* One of the [[Mental_factors_(Buddhism)#Seven_universal_mental_factors|seven universal mental factors]] within the Theravada abhidharma teachings. 
* One of the qualities associated with the second [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]], according to the Pali Canon.&lt;ref&gt;Henepola Gunaratana, ''The Path of Serenity and Insight: An Explanation of the Buddhist Jhānas'', p.87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roderick S. Bucknell (1993), ''Reinterpreting the Jhanas''. p.375&lt;/ref&gt;
* A factor that counteracts the hindrance of sensory desire ([[kāmacchanda]]) within the [[five hindrances]].

==Definition==
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:
:This is the unification of the mind on its object. Although this factor comes to prominence in the jhānas, where it functions as a jhāna factor, the Abhidhamma teaches that the germ of that capacity for mental unification is present in all types of consciousness, even the most rudimentary. It there functions as the factor which fixes the mind on its object. One-pointedness has non-wandering or non-distraction as its characteristic. Its function is to conglomerate or unite the associated states.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2217-2221}}

Bhikkhu Bodhi also explains that at the level of profound concentration (i.e. in the jhanas), it manifests as peace, and its proximate cause is happiness.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2217-2221}} 

Nina van Gorkom explains:
:Ekaggatā is the cetasika which has as function to focus on that one object. Seeing-consciousness, for example, can only know visible object, it cannot know any other object and ekaggatā focuses on visible object. Hearing-consciousness can only know sound, it cannot know visible object or any other object and ekaggatā focuses on sound.

The [[Atthasālinī]] (1, Part IV, Chapter 1. 118, 119) states about ekaggatā (in the context of sammā-samādhi):
: This concentration, known as one-pointedness of mind, has non-scattering (of itself) or non-distraction (of associated states) as characteristic, the welding together of the coexistent states as function, as water kneads bath-powder into a paste, and peace of mind or knowledge as manifestation. For it has been said: 'He who is concentrated knows, sees according to the truth.' It is distinguished by having ease (sukha) (usually) as a proximate cause. Like the steadiness of a lamp in the absence of wind, so should steadfastness of mind be understood.&lt;ref name=gorkom1&gt;Gorkom (2010), [http://www.zolag.co.uk/Cetasikas/html_node/Concentration.html#Concentration Definition of ekaggata]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ajahn Sucitto explains:
: This is the factor of absorption that arises dependent on bringing to mind, non-involvement and evaluation. It occurs in meditation when the quality of ease has calmed rapture and the mental energy; the energy of focusing and the bodily energy are in harmony. The resultant merging of mind and body is experienced as a firmness in awareness, which is hence not penetrated by sense-impressions.&lt;ref&gt;Ajahn Sucitto (2011). ''Meditation, A Way of Awakening''. Amaravati Publications. p. 267. (from the glossary)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emanuel Rádl''' (December 21, 1873 &amp;ndash; May 12, 1942) was an original [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[biologist]], [[History of science|historian of science]], [[philosophy|philosopher]] and a critical supporter of [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|Masaryk´s]] pre-war democratic [[Czechoslovakia]]. He earned international renown by his works on the evolution of neural system and as historian of evolution theories.

== Life and thought ==
One of five children of a village merchant's family in [[Pyšely]] (35&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Prague]]), Rádl studied biology at [[Charles University]] in Prague, where he became assistant professor in 1904 and full professor in 1919. He worked on the [[neural system]] of [[insects]], on [[phototropism]] and on the evolution of [[visual perception|sight]]. Influenced by the German biologist and philosopher [[Hans Driesch]], he became interested in [[vitalism|philosophy of life]] and in a large work ''The History of Biological Theories'' (in German 1905&amp;ndash;1909, in English 1930; reprint in 1988) he criticized the [[evolutionism]] of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann&amp;ndash;Markoš (eds.). ''Emanuel Rádl''. Praha 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; At the book's climax at the end of Chapter 33, Rádl dismisses Darwinism with the words

{{quote|We may therefore sum up the modern position in Driesch's words: 'For those with insight Darwinism has been dead for a long time'... Darwinism as a tyrannic doctrine, which imperiously enchains the minds of men, is dead.|Rádl, ''The History of Biological Theories'', 1930. p. 388}}

Under the influence of Masaryk he inclined more and more towards philosophical questions, became a critic of scientific [[positivism]] and after the establishment of [[Czechoslovakia]] (1918) a public critic of several contemporary tendencies he considered dangerous. He wrote books on Czech and German [[nationalism]], on [[social justice]], on the fundamental differences between the West and the East and very early against the misuse of [[racial theories]] and against [[antisemitism]]. Together with the Protestant theologian J. L. Hromádka he co-founded the Czech Academic [[YMCA]] and published numerous booklets on various public topics. In 1934 he presided the 8th International Congress of Philosophy in Prague, but after 1935 he was gradually excluded from public life by a serious illness. He died in 1942 in Prague during the German occupation in almost complete isolation. His posthumous book ''Consolation from Philosophy'', in the oppressive mood of war, is a highly personal profession of faith in the lasting values of truth and religion and evoked a lively discussion after its publication in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Patočka]], ''Věčnost a dějinnost''. Praha 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"How to save our civilization from decay? This is the desperate question of our time, the more desperate that no one feels the danger."&lt;ref&gt;E. Rádl, ''Útěcha z filosofie''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Equinet''' is the '''European Network of Equality Bodies'''. It serves as a professional platform for cooperation, capacity building and peer support amongst equality bodies around the legal interpretation and implementation in practice of the EU equal treatment Directives and around the promotion of equality and the elimination of discrimination.&lt;ref name="Equinet"&gt;{{cite web|last=Equinet|title=Strategic Plan 2015-2018|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/spip.php?action=telecharger&amp;arg=1754&amp;type=application.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equinet currently consists of 46 Equality Bodies from 34 different European countries. Members of Equinet have been established on the basis of the [[List of European Union directives#Anti-discrimination measures|EU equal treatment Directives]] and they are empowered to counteract discrimination across the range of grounds including [[Ageing|age]], [[disability]], [[gender]], [[Race (human classification)|race]] or [[ethnic origin]], [[religion]] or [[belief]], and [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="age-platform"&gt;{{cite web|last=AGE|title=Factsheet on Equinet|url=http://www.age-platform.eu/images/stories/EN/pdf_AGE_Factsheet_on_Equinet-2.pdf|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Equinet builds upon the two-year project "''Strengthening the co-operation between specialised bodies for the implementation of equal treatment legislation''" (2002-2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gunda Werner Institute|title=Institutions Of The EU Commission And Parliament|url=http://www.gwi-boell.de/web/eu-gender-politics-institutions-eu-commission-3055.html|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The initiative to create a network of equality bodies was taken by the Migration Policy Group,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Migration Policy Group|title=Migration Policy Group|url=http://www.migpolgroup.com/|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also acted as Equinet's Secretariat until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Migration Policy Group|title=Project: Equality bodies|url=http://www.migpolgroup.com/projects_detail.php?id=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Equinet was established as an independent structure in 2007 with the creation of the Equinet Secretariat in Brussels and its registration as a not-for-profit international association ([[AISBL]]) under [[Belgian law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=European Commission|title=EU action against discrimination Activity report 2007-08|url=http://www.igfse.pt/upload/docs/gabdoc/2009/Novidades/07-Jul/EU%20action%20against%20discrimination_Activity%20report%202007-08.pdf|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
Equinet is the European network of equality bodies. The network promotes equality in Europe through supporting and enabling the work of national equality bodies. It supports equality bodies to be independent and effective as valuable catalysts for more equal societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Equinet|title=Equinet at a Glance|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/-About-us-|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Apart from being a platform for exchange among member equality bodies, Equinet contributes to the wider European debate on matters of equal-treatment and non-discrimination by sharing the experience of equality bodies through so-called perspectives aimed at equality experts and policy-makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=SIPU International|title=Review of EU Networks for Civil Society Organizations|url=http://zaklada.civilnodrustvo.hr/upload/File/hr/izdavastvo/digitalna_zbirka/eu_networks.pdf|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Equinet attempts to strengthen the voice and contributions of national equality bodies to the wider European equality debate. Equinet's input in advancing equality is achieved by:&lt;ref name="Equinet Strategic Plan 2015-2018"&gt;{{cite web|last=Equinet Webpage|title=Strategic Plan 2015-2018|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/spip.php?action=telecharger&amp;arg=1754&amp;type=application.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Building capacity and peer support of equality bodies
*Contributing to the European equality agenda
*Serving as a knowledge and communication hub on equal treatment 
*Consolidating the network and the position of its members

Equinet is an umbrella organisation for European equality bodies and has no mandate to provide any kind of legal assistance to individual victims of discrimination. The organisation however provides contact details (see next section) for equality bodies based in all EU members states and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AGE|title=Factsheet on Equinet|url=http://www.age-platform.eu/images/stories/EN/pdf_AGE_Factsheet_on_Equinet-2.pdf|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   EU anti-discrimination legislation provides that each Member State shall have (at least) one such equality body with the power to, among other, give independent assistance to victims of discrimination. The equality bodies are specialised authorities whose staff are trained and experienced to handle cases of discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ENAR - European Network Against Racism|title=What you can do if you are a victim of racial/ethnic discrimination|url=http://www.enar-eu.org/Page_Generale.asp?DocID=29966&amp;lb=3884|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
Most Equinet members belong to the [[European Union]], while six equality bodies come from outside the European Union ([[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Norway]] and [[Serbia]]).

The main decisions concerning the general direction of Equinet are taken by the [[Popular assembly|General Assembly]] of Members. This assembly is made up of all the members of the network and is convened at least once a year for an annual general meeting (AGM). The General Assembly has the power to approve new members and, following a nomination process by members, to vote for representatives on the Executive Board etc.&lt;ref&gt;Equinet ''Annual Report 2013''. 2014, p. 16.{{cite web|title=Annual Report 2013|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/spip.php?action=telecharger&amp;arg=1671&amp;type=application.pdf|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Executive Board====

Management and administration of the network is delegated to the [[Executive Board]]. The Board is also responsible for the preparation and implementation of the AGM’s decisions. Executive Board Members, the advisor to the Board and the treasurer receive no salary for their input.&lt;ref&gt;Equinet ''Annual Report 2013'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

====Working Groups====

[[Working groups]] are composed of staff from member organisations and led by a moderator. Working groups are the main medium for the sharing of expertise between different equality bodies. There were four Equinet Working Groups in 2015:&lt;ref&gt;Equinet ''Working Groups''.{{cite web|title=Equinet Working Groups|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/-Thematic-Working-Groups-|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Equality Law in Practice – supporting equality bodies in their legal work 
*Gender Equality – supporting the effective promotion of gender equality and the combat against gender discrimination by equality bodies
*Communication Strategies and Practices – supporting equality bodies in their communication work
*Policy Formation – supporting a dialogue on the learning from the work of equality bodies

====The Secretariat====

The [[Secretariat (administrative office)|Secretariat]] reports to the Executive Board and implements the annual work plan of the organisation. It is responsible for the daily activities of the network and assists individual members with their requests. It assists and coordinates the work of the Working Groups. There are 6 employees working at the Equinet secretariat.&lt;ref&gt;Equinet Secretariat. {{cite web|title=Equinet Secretariat|url=http://www.equineteurope.org/-Secretariat-|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erikson's stages of psychosocial development''', as articulated in the second half of the 20th century by [[Erik Erikson]] in collaboration with [[Joan Erikson]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mcg. Thomas Jr., "Joan Erikson Is Dead at 95; Shaped Thought on Life Cycles," ''New York Times'' obituary, August 8, 1997. Online at https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/08/us/joan-erikson-is-dead-at-95-shaped-thought-on-life-cycles.html.&lt;/ref&gt; is a comprehensive [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theory that identifies a series of eight [[developmental stage theories|stage]]s that a healthy developing individual should pass through from [[Infant|infancy]] to late [[adulthood]].

Erikson's stage theory characterizes an individual advancing through the eight life stages as a function of negotiating his or her biological and sociocultural forces. Each stage is characterized by a psychosocial crisis of these two conflicting forces. If an individual does indeed successfully reconcile these forces (favoring the first mentioned attribute in the crisis), he or she emerges from the stage with the corresponding virtue. For example, if an infant enters into the toddler stage (autonomy vs. shame and doubt) with more trust than mistrust, he or she carries the virtue of hope into the remaining life stages.&lt;ref name=Crain&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crain|first1=William|title=Theories of Development: Concepts and Applications|edition=6th |year=2011|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc. |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=978-0-205-81046-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges of stages not successfully completed may be expected to return as problems in the future. However, mastery of a stage is not required to advance to the next stage. The outcome of one stage is not permanent and can be modified by later experiences.

===Hope: Trust vs. Mistrust (oral-sensory, Infancy, under 2 years)===
*Existential Question: Can I Trust the World?

The first stage of Erik Erikson's theory centers around the infant's basic needs being met by the parents and how this interaction leads to trust or mistrust. Trust as defined by Erikson is "an essential trustfulness of others as well as a fundamental sense of one's own trustworthiness."&lt;ref name=Muskigum&gt;http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/erikson.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The infant depends on the parents, especially the mother, for sustenance and comfort. The child's relative understanding of world and society comes from the parents and their interaction with the child. A child's first trust is always with the parent or caregiver; whoever that might be, however, the caregiver is secondary whereas the parents are primary in the eyes of the child. If the parents expose the child to warmth, regularity, and dependable affection, the infant's view of the world will be one of trust. Should parents fail to provide a secure environment and to meet the child's basic needs; a sense of mistrust will result.&lt;ref name=Bee&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bee |first1=Helen |last2=Boyd |first2=Denise |title=The Developing Child |edition=12th |date=March 2009 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-0-205-68593-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of mistrust can lead to feelings of frustration, suspicion, withdrawal, and a lack of confidence.&lt;ref name=Muskigum /&gt;

According to Erik Erikson, the major developmental task in infancy is to learn whether or not other people, especially primary caregivers, regularly satisfy basic needs. If caregivers are consistent sources of food, comfort, and affection, an infant learns trust — that others are dependable and reliable. If they are neglectful, or perhaps even abusive, the infant instead learns mistrust — that the world is an undependable, unpredictable, and possibly a dangerous place. While negative, having some experience with mistrust allows the infant to gain an understanding of what constitutes dangerous situations later in life; yet being at the stage of infant or toddler, it is a good idea not to put them in prolonged situations of mistrust: the child's number one needs are to feel safe, comforted, and well cared for.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;

===Will: Autonomy vs. Shame/Doubt (muscular-anal, Toddlerhood, 2–4 years)===
*Existential Question: Is It Okay to Be Me?
As the child gains control over eliminative functions and [[Motor skill|motor abilities]], they begin to explore their surroundings. Parents still provide a strong base of security from which the child can venture out to assert their will. The parents' patience and encouragement helps foster autonomy in the child. Children at this age like to explore the world around them and they are constantly learning about their environment. Caution must be taken at this age while children may explore things that are dangerous to their health and safety. 

At this age children develop their first interests. For example, a child who enjoys music may like to play with the radio. Children who enjoy the outdoors may be interested in animals and plants. Highly restrictive parents, however, are more likely to instill in the child a sense of doubt, and reluctance to attempt new challenges. As they gain increased muscular coordination and mobility, toddlers become capable of satisfying some of their own needs. They begin to feed themselves, wash and dress themselves, and use the bathroom.

If caregivers encourage self-sufficient behavior, toddlers develop a sense of autonomy—a sense of being able to handle many problems on their own. But if caregivers demand too much too soon, or refuse to let children perform tasks of which they are capable, or ridicule early attempts at self-sufficiency, children may instead develop shame and doubt about their ability to handle problems.

===Purpose: Initiative vs. Guilt (locomotor-genital, Early Childhood, 5–8 years)===
*Existential Question: Is it Okay for Me to Do, Move, and Act? 
Initiative adds to autonomy the quality of planning, undertaking and attacking a task for the sake of just being active and on the move.  The child is learning to master the world around them, learning basic skills and principles of physics. Things fall down, not up. Round things roll. They learn how to zip and tie, count and speak with ease. At this stage, the child wants to begin and complete their own actions for a purpose. Guilt is a confusing new emotion. They may feel guilty over things that logically should not cause guilt. They may feel guilt when this initiative does not produce desired results.

The development of courage and independence are what set preschoolers, ages three to six years of age, apart from other age groups. Young children in this category face the challenge of initiative versus guilt. As described in Bee and Boyd (2004),&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt; the child during this stage faces the complexities of planning and developing a sense of judgment. During this stage, the child learns to take initiative and prepare for leadership and goal achievement roles. Activities sought out by a child in this stage may include risk-taking behaviors, such as crossing a street alone or riding a bike without a helmet; both these examples involve self-limits. 

Within instances requiring initiative, the child may also develop negative behaviors. These negative behaviors are a result of the child developing a sense of frustration for not being able to achieve a goal as planned and may engage in negative behaviors that seem aggressive, ruthless, and overly assertive to parents. Aggressive behaviors, such as throwing objects, hitting, or yelling, are examples of observable behaviors during this stage.

Preschoolers are increasingly able to accomplish tasks on their own, and can start new things. With this growing independence comes many choices about activities to be pursued. Sometimes children take on projects they can readily accomplish, but at other times they undertake projects that are beyond their capabilities or that interfere with other people's plans and activities. If parents and preschool teachers encourage and support children's efforts, while also helping them make realistic and appropriate choices, children develop initiative—independence in planning and undertaking activities. But if, instead, adults discourage the pursuit of independent activities or dismiss them as silly and bothersome, children develop guilt about their needs and desires.&lt;ref&gt;Axia College Materials (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competence: Industry vs. Inferiority (latency, Middle Childhood, 9-12 years)===
*Existential Question: Can I Make it in the World of People and Things?
The aim to bring a productive situation to completion gradually supersedes the whims and wishes of [[Play (activity)|play]].
The fundamentals of technology are developed. The failure to master trust, autonomy, and industrious skills may cause the child to doubt his or her future, leading to shame, guilt, and the experience of defeat and inferiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Stages of Social-Emotional Development – Erik Erikson | website = childdevelopmentinfo.com | publisher = Child Development Institute | url = http://childdevelopmentinfo.com/child-development/erickson/#ixzz3ZaBI7RQf | accessdate = 8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The child must deal with demands to learn new skills or risk a sense of inferiority, failure, and incompetence.

"Children at this age are becoming more aware of themselves as individuals." They work hard at "being responsible, being good and doing it right." They are now more reasonable to share and cooperate. Allen and Marotz (2003)&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allen |first1=Eileen |last2=Marotz |first2=Lynn |title=Developmental Profiles Pre-Birth Through Twelve |edition=4th |year=2003 |publisher=Thomson Delmar Learning |location=Albany, NY |isbn=978-0-7668-3765-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also list some perceptual cognitive developmental traits specific for this age group. Children grasp the concepts of [[space]] and time in more logical, practical ways. They gain a better understanding of cause and effect, and of calendar time. At this stage, children are eager to [[learn]] and accomplish more complex skills: reading, writing, telling time. They also get to form [[moral values]], recognize cultural and individual differences and are able to manage most of their personal needs and grooming with minimal assistance.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; At this stage, children might express their independence by talking back and being disobedient and rebellious.

Erikson viewed the [[elementary school]] years as critical for the development of [[self-confidence]]. Ideally, elementary school provides many opportunities to achieve the recognition of teachers, parents and peers by producing things—drawing pictures, solving addition problems, writing sentences, and so on. If children are encouraged to make and do things and are then praised for their accomplishments, they begin to demonstrate industry by being diligent, persevering at tasks until completed, and putting work before pleasure. If children are instead ridiculed or punished for their efforts or if they find they are incapable of meeting their teachers' and parents' expectations, they develop feelings of [[inferiority]] about their capabilities.&lt;ref name="Crain"/&gt;

At this age, children start recognizing their special talents and continue to discover interests as their education improves.  They may begin to choose to do more 
activities to pursue that interest, such as joining a sport if they know they have athletic ability, or joining the band if they are good at music.  If not allowed to discover their own talents in their own time, they will develop a sense of lack of motivation, low self-esteem, and lethargy.  They may become "couch potatoes" if they are not allowed to develop interests.

===Fidelity: Identity vs. Role Confusion (Adolescence, 13–19 years)===
*Existential Question: Who Am I and What Can I Be?
The adolescent is newly concerned with how they appear to others. Superego identity is the accrued confidence that the outer sameness and continuity prepared in the future are matched by the sameness and continuity of one's meaning for oneself, as evidenced in the promise of a career. The ability to settle on a school or occupational identity is pleasant. In later stages of adolescence, the child develops a sense of [[sexual identity]]. As they make the transition from childhood to adulthood, adolescents ponder the roles they will play in the adult world. Initially, they are apt to experience some role confusion—mixed ideas and feelings about the specific ways in which they will fit into society—and may experiment with a variety of behaviors and activities (e.g. tinkering with cars, baby-sitting for neighbors, affiliating with certain political or religious groups). Eventually, Erikson proposed, most adolescents achieve a sense of identity regarding who they are and where their lives are headed.

The teenager must achieve identity in occupation, gender roles, politics, and, in some cultures, religion.

Erikson is credited with coining the term "[[identity crisis]]".&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt;{{rp|29}} Each stage that came before and that follows has its own 'crisis', but even more so now, for this marks the transition from childhood to adulthood. This passage is necessary because "Throughout infancy and childhood, a person forms many identifications. But the need for identity in youth is not met by these."&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wright, Jr |first1=J. Eugene |title=Erikson: Identity and Religion |year=1982 |publisher=Seabury Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-8164-2362-8 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; This turning point in human development seems to be the reconciliation between 'the person one has come to be' and 'the person society expects one to become'. This emerging sense of self will be established by 'forging' past experiences with anticipations of the future. In relation to the eight life stages as a whole, the fifth stage corresponds to the crossroads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is unique about the stage of Identity is that it is a special sort of synthesis of earlier stages and a special sort of anticipation of later ones. Youth has a certain unique quality in a person's life; it is a bridge between childhood and adulthood. Youth is a time of radical change—the great body changes accompanying puberty, the ability of the mind to search one's own intentions and the intentions of others, the suddenly sharpened awareness of the roles society has offered for later life.&lt;ref name=Gross&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gross |first1=Francis L. |title=Introducing Erik Erikson: An Invitation to his Thinking|year=1987 |publisher=University Press of America |location=Lanham, MD |isbn=0-8191-5788-0 |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adolescents "are confronted by the need to re-establish [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]] for themselves and to do this in the face of an often potentially hostile world".&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite book |last=Stevens |first=Richard |title=Erik Erikson: An Introduction |year=1983 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-312-25812-2 |pages=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often challenging since commitments are being asked for before particular identity roles have formed. At this point, one is in a state of 'identity confusion', but society normally makes allowances for youth to "find themselves", and this state is called 'the moratorium':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The problem of adolescence is one of role confusion—a reluctance to commit which may haunt a person into his mature years. Given the right conditions—and Erikson believes these are essentially having enough space and time, a psychosocial moratorium, when a person can freely experiment and explore—what may emerge is a firm sense of identity, an emotional and deep awareness of who he or she is.&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As in other stages, bio-psycho-social forces are at work. No matter how one has been raised, one's personal ideologies are now chosen for oneself. Often, this leads to conflict with adults over religious and political orientations. Another area where teenagers are deciding for themselves is their career choice, and often parents want to have a decisive say in that role. If society is too insistent, the teenager will acquiesce to external wishes, effectively forcing him or her to ‘foreclose' on experimentation and, therefore, true self-discovery. Once someone settles on a worldview and vocation, will he or she be able to integrate this aspect of self-definition into a diverse society? According to Erikson, when an adolescent has balanced both perspectives of "What have I got?" and "What am I going to do with it?" he or she has established their identity:&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dependent on this stage is the ego quality of ''fidelity—the ability to sustain loyalties freely pledged in spite of the inevitable contradictions and confusions of value systems''. (Italics in original)&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Given that the next stage (Intimacy) is often characterized by marriage, many are tempted to cap off the fifth stage at 20 years of age. However, these age ranges are actually quite fluid, especially for the achievement of identity, since it may take many years to become grounded, to identify the object of one's fidelity, to feel that one has "come of age". In the biographies ''[[Young Man Luther]]'' and ''[[Gandhi's Truth]]'', Erikson determined that their crises ended at ages 25 and 30, respectively:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Erikson does note that the time of Identity crisis for persons of genius is frequently prolonged. He further notes that in our industrial society, identity formation tends to be long, because it takes us so long to gain the skills needed for adulthood's tasks in our technological world. So… we do not have an exact time span in which to find ourselves. It doesn't happen automatically at eighteen or at twenty-one. A ''very'' approximate rule of thumb for our society would put the end somewhere in one's twenties.&lt;ref name="Gross"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Love: Intimacy vs. Isolation (Early Adulthood, 20-39 years)===
*Existential Question: Can I Love?
The Intimacy vs. Isolation conflict is emphasized around the age of 30.  At the start of this stage, identity vs. role confusion is coming to an end, though it still lingers at the foundation of the stage (Erikson, 1950).  Young adults are still eager to blend their identities with friends.  They want to fit in.
Erikson believes we are sometimes isolated due to intimacy.  We are afraid of rejections such as being turned down or our partners breaking up with us.  We are familiar with pain and to some of us rejection is so painful that our egos cannot bear it. Erikson also argues that "Intimacy has a counterpart: Distantiation: the readiness to isolate and if necessary, to destroy those forces and people whose essence seems dangerous to our own, and whose territory seems to encroach on the extent of one's intimate relations" (1950).

Once people have established their identities, they are ready to make long-term commitments to others. They become capable of forming intimate, reciprocal relationships (e.g. through close friendships or marriage) and willingly make the sacrifices and compromises that such relationships require. If people cannot form these intimate relationships—perhaps because of their own needs—a sense of isolation may result; arousing feelings of darkness and angst.

===Care: Generativity vs. Stagnation (Middle Adulthood, 40–59 years)===
*Existential Question: Can I Make My Life Count?
[[Generativity]] is the concern of guiding the next generation. Socially-valued work and disciplines are expressions of generativity. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The adult stage of generativity has broad application to family, relationships, work, and society. "Generativity, then is primarily the concern in establishing and guiding the next generation... the concept is meant to include... productivity and creativity."&lt;ref name=Slater2003&gt;{{Citation

During middle age the primary developmental task is one of contributing to society and helping to guide future generations. When a person makes a contribution during this period, perhaps by raising a family or working toward the betterment of society, a sense of generativity—a sense of productivity and accomplishment—results. In contrast, a person who is self-centered and unable or unwilling to help society move forward develops a feeling of stagnation—a dissatisfaction with the relative lack of productivity.

:Central tasks of middle adulthood
* Express love through more than sexual contacts.
* Maintain healthy life patterns.
* Develop a sense of unity with mate.
* Help growing and grown children to be responsible adults.
* Relinquish central role in lives of grown children.
* Accept children's mates and friends.
* Create a comfortable home.
* Be proud of accomplishments of self and mate/spouse.
* Reverse roles with aging parents.
* Achieve mature, civic and social responsibility.
* Adjust to physical changes of middle age.
* Use leisure time creatively.

===Wisdom: ego integrity vs. despair (Late Adulthood, 60 years and above)===
*Existential Question: Is it Okay to Have Been Me?
As we grow older and become senior citizens we tend to slow down our productivity and explore life as a retired person. It is during this time that we contemplate our accomplishments and are able to develop [[ego integrity|integrity]] if we see ourselves as leading a successful life. If we see our life as unproductive, or feel that we did not accomplish our life goals, we become dissatisfied with life and develop [[despair]], often leading to depression and hopelessness.

The final developmental task is retrospection: people look back on their lives and accomplishments. They develop feelings of contentment and integrity if they believe that they have led a happy, productive life. They may instead develop a sense of despair if they look back on a life of disappointments and unachieved goals.

This stage can occur out of the sequence when an individual feels they are near the end of their life (such as when receiving a terminal disease diagnosis).

===Ninth stage===
*Psychosocial Crises: All first eight stages in reverse quotient order
[[Joan Erikson|Joan M. Erikson]], who married and collaborated with Erik Erikson, added a ninth stage in ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version''.&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Living in the ninth stage, she wrote, "old age in one's eighties and nineties brings with it new demands, reevaluations, and daily difficulties". Addressing these new challenges requires "designating a new ninth stage". Erikson was ninety-three years old when she wrote about the ninth stage.&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 4, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan Erikson showed that all the eight stages "are relevant and recurring in the ninth stage".&lt;ref&gt;James Mooney, "Erik Erikson" in  Joe L. Kincheloe, Raymond A. Horn, editors, ''The Praeger Handbook of Education and Psychology, Volume 1'' (Praeger, 2007), 78.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ninth stage, the psychosocial crises of the eight stages are faced again, but with the quotient order reversed. For example, in the first stage (infancy), the psychosocial crisis was "Trust vs. Mistrust" with Trust being the "syntonic quotient" and Mistrust being the "dystonic".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Erikson applies the earlier psychosocial crises to the ninth stage as follows:

'''"Basic Mistrust vs. Trust: Hope"'''&lt;br/&gt;
In the ninth stage, "elders are forced to mistrust their own capabilities" because one's "body inevitably weakens". Yet, Joan Erikson asserts that "while there is light, there is hope" for a "bright light and revelation".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Shame and Doubt vs. Autonomy: Will"'''&lt;br/&gt;
Ninth stage elders face the "shame of lost control" and doubt "their autonomy over their own bodies". So it is that "shame and doubt challenge cherished autonomy".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Inferiority vs. Industry: Competence"'''&lt;br/&gt;
Industry as a "driving force" that elders once had is gone in the ninth stage. Being incompetent "because of aging is belittling" and makes elders "like unhappy small children of great age".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Identity confusion vs. Identity: Fidelity"'''&lt;br/&gt;
Elders experience confusion about their "existential identity" in the ninth stage and "a real uncertainty about status and role".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 109-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Isolation vs. Intimacy: Love"'''&lt;br/&gt;
In the ninth stage, the "years of intimacy and love" are often replaced by "isolation and deprivation". Relationships become "overshadowed by new incapacities and dependencies".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 110-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Stagnation vs. Generativity: Care"'''&lt;br/&gt;
The generativity in the seventh stage of "work and family relationships", if it goes satisfactorily, is "a wonderful time to be alive". In one's eighties and nineties, there is less energy for generativity or caretaking. Thus, "a sense of stagnation may well take over".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 111-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Despair and Disgust vs. Integrity: Wisdom"'''&lt;br/&gt;
Integrity imposes "a serious demand on the senses of elders". Wisdom requires capacities that ninth stage elders "do not usually have". The eighth stage includes retrospection that can evoke a "degree of disgust and despair". In the ninth stage, introspection is replaced by the attention demanded to one's "loss of capacities and disintegration".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Living in the ninth stage, Joan Erikson expressed confidence that the psychosocial crisis of the ninth stage can be met as in the first stage with the "basic trust" with which "we are blessed".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 112-113. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of post-Freudian theory==
Erikson was a student of [[Anna Freud]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wrightsman |first=Lawrence S. |title=Adult Personality Development |year=1994 |publisher=Sage Publications, Inc. |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=0-8039-4400-4 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of [[Sigmund Freud]], whose psychoanalytic theory and [[psychosexual stages]] contributed to the basic outline of the eight stages, at least those concerned with childhood. Namely, the first four of Erikson's life stages correspond to Freud's oral, anal, phallic, and latency phases, respectively. Also, the fifth stage of adolescence is said to parallel the genital stage in psychosexual development:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although the first three phases are linked to those of the Freudian theory, it can be seen that they are conceived along very different lines. Emphasis is not so much on sexual modes and their consequences as on the ego qualities which emerge from each stages. There is an attempt also to link the sequence of individual development to the broader context of society.&lt;ref name="Stevens"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Erikson saw a dynamic at work throughout life, one that did not stop at adolescence. He also viewed the life stages as a cycle: the end of one generation was the beginning of the next. Seen in its social context, the life stages were linear for an individual but circular for societal development:&lt;ref name=Erikson&gt;{{cite book |last=Erikson |first=Erik H. |title=Childhood and Society |year=1993 |origyear=1950 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-393-31068-9 |page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Freud's view, development is largely complete by adolescence. In contrast, one of Freud's students, Erik Erikson (1902–1994) believed that development continues throughout life. Erikson took the foundation laid by Freud and extended it through adulthood and into late life.&lt;ref name=Kail&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kail |first1=Robert V. |last2=Cavanaugh |first2=John C. |title=Human development: A life-span view |year=2004 |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Thomson/Wadsworth]] |location=Belmont, CA |isbn=978-0-534-59751-1 |page=16 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Critique==
{{POV section|date=June 2018}} &lt;!-- surely there are some critical experimental results? This theory doesn't have consensus support, does it? --&gt;
Erikson's theory may be questioned as to whether his stages must be regarded as sequential, and only occurring within the age ranges he suggests.  There is debate{{Citation needed|reason=Where are the references to debate|date=July 2018}} as to whether people only search for identity during the adolescent years or if one stage needs to happen before other stages can be completed. However, Erikson states that each of these processes occur throughout the lifetime in one form or another, and he emphasizes these "phases" only because it is at these times that the conflicts become most prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association |year=1956 |volume=4 |pages=56–121 |title=The problem of ego identity |last=Erikson |first=Erik |url=http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=apa.004.0056a |format=pdf |accessdate=2012-01-28 |doi=10.1177/000306515600400104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most empirical research into Erikson has related to his views on adolescence and attempts to establish identity. His theoretical approach was studied and supported, particularly regarding adolescence, by [[James Marcia|James E. Marcia]].&lt;ref name="Marcia"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology  |year=1966 |volume=3 |pages=551–558 |title=Development and validation of ego identity status |last=Marcia |first=James E. |url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1984/A1984TR91100001.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-01-28|doi=10.1037/h0023281 |pmid=5939604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marcia's work has distinguished different forms of identity, and there is some empirical evidence that those people who form the most coherent self-concept in adolescence are those who are most able to make intimate attachments in early adulthood. This supports the part of Eriksonian theory, that suggests that those best equipped to resolve the crisis of early adulthood are those who have most successfully resolved the crisis of adolescence.

'''Giuseppe Chiari''' (1926&amp;ndash;2007) was an [[Avant-Garde]] Florentine [[conceptual artist]] and [[experimental music]]ian active in [[Neo-Dada]] circles, specifically the [[Fluxus]] art movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=36943 Giuseppe Chiari at MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt; Chiari was a supporter of [[intermedia]] work conducted between music, speech, gesture and image.

==Life and work==
Giuseppe Chiari was born in Florence, Italy on September 26, 1926. In Florence he devoted himself to studying [[piano]] and music composition in parallel with studies in mathematics and engineering (1946–51).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giuseppechiari.it/index.php?id=4 Giuseppe Chiari in the dalla Enciclopedia Italiana]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was especially drawn to the work of [[John Cage]], and himself began to take an interest in promoting experimental research in visual music in 1961. In 1962, at the Fluxus Festspiele internationale Neuester Musik in Wiesbaden, he joined the [[Fluxus]] group, taking on the role of artist-composer-philosopher. Among his writings are: Music without counterpoint (1969), Untitled (1971), Mother Music (1973); Teatrino (1974) Art (1974), Method for playing (1976); Aesthetik (1984), Doubt harmony (1990) and Music (1994).

Chiari made what he called "action music" based on a complex method of execution and traditional instruments: music that takes as its essential element [[random]] sounds (water, dry leaves, stones). His work “Giuocare con l’acqua e dire la parola acqua” (“Playing with water and saying the word water”) is quite remarkable for both the transformation of the pages of the script into an aesthetic object, and the clarity and rigour of the texts that preludes to the later production of statements typical of [[conceptual art]]. His Work ''Fogli pentagrammati'', 1975, is in Museo cantonale d'arte of [[Lugano]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-mca.ti.ch/lugano/eMuseumPlus?service=direct/1/ResultDetailView/result.inline.lightbox.t1.collection_lightbox.$TspTitleImageLink.link&amp;sp=13&amp;sp=Sartist&amp;sp=SfilterDefinition&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=1&amp;sp=3&amp;sp=SdetailView&amp;sp=19&amp;sp=Sdetail&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=T&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=Slightbox_3x4&amp;sp=0&amp;sp=T&amp;sp=0 Museo cantonale d'arte, Lugano: Giuseppe Chiari]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiari experimented with different visual mediums: from painting-[[collage]]s, [[sheet music]], and photographs. His graphic and pictorial work is partially preserved at the International Centre of Contemporary Art Tornabuoni in Florence.

[[File:Pieter Brueghel the Younger - Proverbs (detail) - WGA03627.jpg|thumb|[[Netherlandish Proverbs|''One winds on the distaff what the other spins'']] (Both spread gossip) by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]]]

'''Gossip''' is idle talk or [[rumor]], especially about the personal or private affairs of others; the act is also known as '''dishing''' or '''tattling'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gossip?s=t|title=Gossip - Define Gossip at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gossip has been researched in terms of its origins in [[evolutionary psychology]],&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite news |last=McAndrew |first=Frank T. |title=The Science of Gossip: Why we can't stop ourselves |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-science-of-gossip |date=October 2008 |work=[[Scientific American]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has found gossip to be an important means for people to monitor cooperative [[reputation]]s and so maintain widespread [[Reciprocity (evolution)#Indirect reciprocity|indirect reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;Sommerfeld RD, Krambeck HJ, Semmann D, Milinski M. (2007). [http://www.pnas.org/content/104/44/17435.full.pdf Gossip as an alternative for direct observation in games of indirect reciprocity]. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 104(44):17435-40. {{PMID|17947384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect reciprocity is a social interaction in which one actor helps another and is then benefited by a third party. Gossip has also been identified by [[Robin Dunbar]], an evolutionary biologist, as aiding [[Human bonding|social bonding]] in large groups.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar RI. (2004). [http://attach.matita.net/ziorufus/Dunbar%20gossip.pdf Gossip in evolutionary perspective]. Review of general psychology 8: 100-110. [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15804371 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Wiktionary}}
The word is from [[Old English]] ''godsibb'', from ''[[god (word)|god]]'' and ''[[sibb]]'', the term for the [[godparents]] of one's child or the parents of one's godchild, generally very close friends. In the 16th century, the word assumed the meaning of a person, mostly a woman, one who delights in idle talk, a newsmonger, a tattler.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century, the term was extended from the talker to the conversation of such persons. The verb ''to gossip'', meaning "to be a gossip", first appears in [[Shakespeare]].

The term originates from the bedroom at the time of childbirth. Giving birth used to be a social event exclusively attended by women. The pregnant woman's female relatives and neighbours would congregate and idly converse. Over time, gossip came to mean talk of others.&lt;ref&gt;"If Walls Could Talk: The History of the Home (Bedroom), Lucy Worsley,  BBC"&lt;/ref&gt;

Others say that gossip comes from the same root as "gospel" -- it is a contraction of "good spiel", meaning a good story.

==Workplace gossip==
Mary Gormandy White, a [[Human resource management|human resource]] expert, gives the following "signs" for identifying workplace gossip:
* Animated people become silent ("Conversations stop when you enter the room")
* People begin staring at someone
* Workers indulge in inappropriate topics of conversation.&lt;ref name=IAAP&gt;Jeanne Grunert, "When Gossip Strikes," ''OfficePro'', January/February 2010, pp. 16-18, at 17, found at [http://www.iaap-hq.org/publications/officepro/opfliparchive/janfeb2010/pageflip.html IAAP website].{{dead link|date=April 2016}} Accessed March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 
White suggests "five tips ... [to] handle the situation with [[aplomb]]:
# Rise above the gossip
# Understand what causes or fuels the gossip
# Do not participate in workplace gossip.
# Allow for the gossip to go away on its own
# If it persists, "gather facts and seek help."&lt;ref name=IAAP /&gt;

Peter Vajda identifies gossip as a form of [[workplace violence]], noting that it is "essentially a form of attack."&lt;!-- http://ezinearticles.com/?Gossip---A-Form-of-Workplace-Violence&amp;id=133712 Gossip - A Form of Workplace Violence, Peter Vajda, Ph.D. --&gt; Gossip is thought by many to "empower one person while disempowering another" (Hafen). Accordingly, many companies have formal policies in their [[employee handbook]]s against gossip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanresourceblog.com/2007/11/16/new-jersey-hearsay-evidence/ New Jersey Hearsay Evidence], Human Resource Blog.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes there is room for disagreement on exactly what constitutes unacceptable gossip, since workplace gossip may take the form of offhand remarks about someone's tendencies such as "He always takes a long lunch," or "Don’t worry, that’s just how she is."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tlkhealthcare.com/files/uploads/newsletter2005Summer.pdf The Culture Shock] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127130901/http://www.tlkhealthcare.com/files/uploads/newsletter2005Summer.pdf |date=2007-11-27 }}, Tami Kyle, TLK Connections, Summer 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; TLK Healthcare cites as examples of gossip, "tattletailing to the boss without intention of furthering a solution or speaking to co-workers about something someone else has done to upset us." Corporate email can be a particularly dangerous method of gossip delivery, as the medium is semi-permanent and messages are easily forwarded to unintended recipients; accordingly, a Mass High Tech article advised employers to instruct employees against using company email networks for gossip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swiggartagin.com/articles/mht.pdf Companies must spell out employee e-mail policies], Warren E. Agin, Swiggart &amp; Agin, LLC, Mass High Tech, November 18, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Low [[self-esteem]] and a desire to "fit in" are frequently cited as motivations for workplace gossip.
There are five essential functions that gossip has in the workplace (according to DiFonzo &amp; Bordia):
* Helps individuals learn social information about other individuals in the organization (often without even having to meet the other individual)
* Builds social networks of individuals by bonding co-workers together and affiliating people with each other.
* Breaks existing bonds by ostracizing individuals within an organization.
* Enhances one's social status/power/prestige within the organization.
* Inform individuals as to what is considered socially acceptable behavior within the organization.

According to Kurkland and Pelled, workplace gossip can be very serious depending upon the amount of [[Power (social and political)|power]] that the gossiper has over the recipient, which will in turn affect how the gossip is interpreted. There are four types of power that are influenced by gossip:
* '''Coercive:''' when a gossiper tells negative information about a person, their recipient might believe that the gossiper will also spread negative information about them. This causes the gossiper's coercive power to increase.
* '''Reward:''' when a gossiper tells positive information about a person, their recipient might believe that the gossiper will also spread positive information about them. This causes the gossiper's reward power to increase.
* '''Expert:''' when a gossiper seems to have very detailed knowledge of either the organization's values or about others in the work environment, their expert power becomes enhanced.
* '''Referent:''' this power can either be reduced OR enhanced to a point. When people view gossiping as a petty activity done to waste time, a gossiper's referent power can decrease along with their reputation. When a recipient is thought of as being invited into a social circle by being a recipient, the gossiper's referent power can increase, but only to a high point where then the recipient begins to resent the gossiper (Kurland &amp; Pelled).

Some negative consequences of workplace gossip may include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/feap/newsletters/workplace-gossip.pdf Workplace Gossip] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127130859/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/feap/newsletters/workplace-gossip.pdf |date=2007-11-27 }}, Kit Hennessy, LPC, CEAP.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lost productivity and wasted time,
* Erosion of trust and morale,
* Increased anxiety among employees as rumors circulate without any clear information as to what is fact and what isn’t,
* Growing divisiveness among employees as people “take sides,"
* Hurt feelings and reputations,
* Jeopardized chances for the gossipers' advancement as they are perceived as unprofessional, and
* Attrition as good employees leave the company due to the unhealthy work atmosphere.
Turner and Weed theorize that among the three main types of responders to [[workplace conflict]] are attackers who cannot keep their feelings to themselves and express their feelings by attacking whatever they can. Attackers are further divided into up-front attackers and behind-the-back attackers. Turner and Weed note that the latter "are difficult to handle because the target person is not sure of the source of any criticism, nor even always sure that there is criticism."&lt;ref&gt;Conflict in organizations: Practical solutions any manager can use; Turner, Stephen P. (University of South Florida); Weed, Frank; 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible however, that there may be illegal, unethical, or disobedient behavior happening at the workplace and this may be a case where reporting the behavior may be viewed as gossip. It is then left up to the authority in charge to fully investigate the matter and not simply look past the report and assume it to be workplace gossip.

Informal networks through which communication occurs in an organization are sometimes called the [[grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]]. In a study done by Harcourt, Richerson, and Wattier, it was found that middle managers in several different organizations believed that gathering information from the grapevine was a much better way of learning information than through formal communication with their subordinates (Harcourt, Richerson &amp; Wattier).

==Various views==
Some see gossip as trivial, hurtful and socially and/or intellectually unproductive. Some people view gossip as a lighthearted way of spreading information. A [[feminism|feminist]] definition of gossip presents it as "a way of talking between women, intimate in style, personal and domestic in scope and setting, a female cultural event which springs from and perpetuates the restrictions of the female role, but also gives the comfort of validation." (Jones, 1990:243)

===In early modern England===
&lt;!-- this section might fit better in an as-yet non-existent article called something like [[gossip (companion)]] --&gt;

In [[Early Modern Britain|Early Modern England]] the word "gossip" referred to companions in [[childbirth]], not limited to the [[midwife]]. It also became a term for women-friends generally, with no necessary derogatory connotations. (OED n. definition 2. a. "A familiar acquaintance, friend, chum", supported by references from 1361 to 1873). It commonly referred to an informal local [[sorority]] or social group, who could enforce socially acceptable behaviour through private censure or through public rituals, such as "[[rough music]]", the [[cucking stool]] and the [[skimmington ride]].

In [[Thomas Harman]]’s ''Caveat for Common Cursitors'' 1566 a ‘[[Thieves' cant|walking mort]]’ relates how she was forced to agree to meet a man in his barn, but informed his wife. The wife arrived with her “five furious, sturdy, muffled gossips” who catch the errant husband with “his hosen about his legs” and give him a sound beating. The story clearly functions as a [[morality tale]] in which the gossips uphold the [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Capp, ''When Gossips Meet: Women, Family and Neighbourhood in Early Modern England'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2003. {{ISBN|0-19-925598-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sir Herbert Maxwell Bart's The Chevalier of the Splendid Crest [1900] at the end of chapter three the king is noted as referring to his loyal knight "Sir Thomas de Roos" in kindly terms as "my old gossip". Whilst a historical novel of that time the reference implies a continued use of the term "Gossip" as childhood friend as late as 1900.

===In Judaism===
{{main article|Lashon hara}}
Judaism considers gossip spoken without a constructive purpose (known in Hebrew as an [[evil tongue]], ''lashon hara'') as a [[sin]]. Speaking negatively about people, even if retelling true facts, counts as sinful, as it demeans the dignity of man — both the speaker and the subject of the gossip.
According to ''[[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]]'' 18:8: "The words of a gossip are like choice morsels: they go down to a man's innermost parts."

===In Christianity===
The Christian perspective on gossip is typically based on modern cultural assumptions of the phenomenon, especially the assumption that generally speaking, gossip is negative speech.&lt;ref&gt;Meng, Margaret (2008). "Gossip: Killing Us Softly." ''Homiletic and Pastoral Review'' 109. pp. 26-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sedler, M.D. (2001). ''Stop the Runaway Conversation: Take Control Over Gossip and Criticism''. Grand Rapids: Chosen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Mathew C. (2013). ''Resisting Gossip: Winning the War of the Wagging Tongue''. Fort Washington: CLC Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the complexity of the phenomenon, biblical scholars have more precisely identified the form and function of gossip, even identifying a socially positive role for the social process as it is described in the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, John W. (2013). ''Gossiping Jesus: The Oral Processing of Jesus in John's Gospel''. Eugene: Pickwick Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, John W. (2012). "Gossip in the New Testament." Biblical Theology Bulletin 42/4. pp. 204-213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Botha, Pieter J. J. (1998). "Paul and Gossip: A Social Mechanism in Early Christian Communities." ''Neotestamentica'' 32. pp. 267-288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Botha, Pieter J. J. (1993). "The Social Dynamics of the Early Transmission of the Jesus Tradition." ''Neotestamentica'' 27. pp. 205-231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kartzow, Marianne B. (2005) "Female Gossipers and their Reputation in the Pastoral Epistles." ''Neotestamentica'' 39. pp. 255-271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kartzow, Marianne B. (2009). ''Gossip and Gender: Othering of Speech in the Pastoral Epistles''. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kartzow, Marianne B. (2010) "[http://www.lectio.unibe.ch/10_1/kartzow2.html Resurrection as Gossip: Representations of Women in Resurrection Stories of the Gospels.]" ''Lectio Difficilior'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohrbaugh, Richard L. (2007). "Gossip in the New Testament." ''The New Testament in Cross-Cultural Perspective.'' Eugene: Cascade Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, this does not mean that there are ''not'' numerous texts in the New Testament that see gossip as dangerous negative speech.

Thus, for example, the [[Epistle to the Romans]] associates gossips ("backbiters") with a list of sins including sexual immorality and with murder:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:28: And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;
:29: Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
:30: Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
:31: Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:
:32: Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. (Romans 1:28-32)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Matthew 18]], Jesus also taught that conflict resolution among church members ought to begin with the aggrieved party attempting to resolve their dispute with the offending party alone. Only if this did not work would the process escalate to the next step, in which another church member would become involved. After that if the person at fault still would not "hear", the matter was to be fully investigated by the church elders, and if not resolved to be then exposed publicly.

Based on texts like these portraying gossip negatively, many Christian authors generalize on the phenomenon. So, in order to gossip, writes Phil Fox Rose, we "must harden our heart towards the 'out' person. We draw a line between ourselves and them; define them as being outside the rules of Christian charity... We create a gap between ourselves and God's Love." As we harden our heart towards more people and groups, he continues, "this negativity and feeling of separateness will grow and permeate our world, and we'll find it more difficult to access God’s love in any aspect of our lives."&lt;ref&gt;Phil Fox Rose, [http://www.patheos.com/blogs/philfoxrose/2012/10/gossip-hardens-our-hearts/ "Gossip hardens our hearts"], ''Patheos''. Accessed February 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament is also in favor of group accountability (Ephesians 5:11; 1st Tim 5:20; James 5:16; Gal 6:1-2; 1 Cor 12:26), which may be associated with gossip.

===In Islam===

Islam considers [[backbiting]] the equivalent of eating the flesh of one's dead brother. According to Muslims, backbiting harms its victims without offering them any chance of defense, just as dead people cannot defend against their flesh being eaten. Muslims are expected to treat others like brothers (regardless of their beliefs, skin color, gender, or ethnic origin), deriving from Islam's concept of brotherhood amongst its believers.

===In Bahai Faith===

Bahais consider backbiting to be the "worst human quality and the most great sin..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahaiquotes.com/quotepage.php?Quotes%2FBackbiting|website=Bahai Quotes.com|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, even murder would be considered less reprobate than backbiting. [[Baha'u'llah]] stated, "Backbiting quencheth the light of the heart, and extinguisheth the life of the soul."  When someone kills another, it only affects their physical condition.  However, when someone gossips, it affects one in a different manner.

==In psychology==

===Evolutionary view===
From Dunbar's evolutionary theories, gossip originated to help bond the groups that were constantly growing in size. To survive, individuals need alliances; but as these alliances grew larger, it was difficult if not impossible to physically connect with everyone. Conversation and language were able to bridge this gap. Gossip became a social interaction that helped the group gain information about other individuals without personally speaking to them. It enabled people to keep up with what was going on in their social network. It also creates a bond between the teller and the hearer, as they share information of mutual interest and spend time together. It also helps the hearer learn about another individual’s behavior and helps them have a more effective approach to their relationship. Dunbar (2004) found that 65% of conversations consist of social topics.&lt;ref name="Dunbar"&gt;Dunbar, R. (2004). Gossip in evolutionary perspective. Review of General Psychology, 8(2), 100-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunbar (1994) argues that gossip is the equivalent of [[social grooming]] often observed in other primate species.&lt;ref name="Dunbar, R.I.M. 1994"&gt;Dunbar, R.I.M. (1994). Grooming, gossip, and the evolution of language. London: Faver &amp; Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropological investigations indicate that gossip is a cross-cultural phenomenon, providing evidence for evolutionary accounts of gossip.&lt;ref&gt;Besnier, N. (1989). Information withholding as a manipulative and collusive strategy in Nukulaelae gossip. Language in society, 18, 315-341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gluckman, M. (1963). Gossip and scandal. Current Anthropology, 4, 307-316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haviland, J.B. 1977"&gt;Haviland, J.B. (1977). Gossip as competition in Zinacantan. Journal of Communication, 27, 186-191.&lt;/ref&gt; There is very little evidence to suggest meaningful sex differences in the proportion of conversational time spent gossiping, and when there is a difference, women are only very slightly more likely to gossip compared with men.&lt;ref name="Dunbar, R.I.M. 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haviland, J.B. 1977"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foster, E.K. (2004). Research on gossip: Taxonomy, methods, and future directions. Review of General Psychology, 8 (2), 78-99.&lt;/ref&gt;
Further support for the evolutionary significance of gossip comes from a recent study published in the peer-reviewed journal, Science. Anderson and colleagues (2011) found that faces paired with negative social information dominate visual consciousness to a greater extent than positive and neutral social information during a binocular rivalry task. Binocular rivalry occurs when two different stimuli are presented to each eye simultaneously and the two percepts compete for dominance in visual consciousness. While this occurs, an individual will consciously perceive one of the percepts while the other is suppressed. After a time, the other percept will become dominant and an individual will become aware of the second percept. Finally, the two percepts will alternate back and forth in terms of visual awareness. The study by Anderson and colleagues (2011) indicates that higher order cognitive processes, like evaluative information processing, can influence early visual processing. That only negative social information differentially affected the dominance of the faces during the task alludes to the unique importance of knowing information about an individual that should be avoided. Since the positive social information did not produce greater perceptual dominance of the matched face indicates that negative information about an individual may be more salient to our behavior than positive.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;Anderson, E., Siegel, E.H., Bliss-Moreau, E. &amp; Barrett, L.F. (2011). The visual impact of gossip. Science Magazine, 332, 1446-1448.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gossip also gives information about social norms and guidelines for behavior. Gossip usually comments on how appropriate a behavior was, and the mere act of repeating it signifies its importance. In this sense, gossip is effective regardless of whether it is positive or negative&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R. F., Zhang, L., &amp; Vohs, K. D. (2004). Gossip as cultural learning. Review of General Psychology, 8, 111–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some theorists have proposed that gossip is actually a pro-social behavior intended to allow an individual to correct their socially prohibitive behavior without direct confrontation of the individual. By gossiping about an individual’s acts, other individuals can subtly indicate that said acts are inappropriate and allow the individual to correct their behavior (Schoeman 1994).

===Perception of those who gossip===
Individuals who are perceived to engage in gossiping regularly are seen as having less social power and being less liked. The type of gossip being exchanged also affects likeability whereby those who engage in negative gossip are less liked than those who engage in positive gossip.&lt;ref&gt;Farley, S. (2011). Is gossip power? The inverse relationship between gossip, power, and likability. European Journal of Social Psychology, 41, 574-579.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study done by Turner and colleagues (2003), having a prior relationship with a gossiper were not found to protect the gossiper from less favorable personality ratings after gossip was exchanged. In the study, two individuals were brought in to the research lab to participate. Either the two individuals were friends prior to the study or they were strangers scheduled to participate at the same time. One of the individuals was a confederate of the study and they engaged in gossiping about the research assistant after she left the room. The gossip exchanged was either positive or negative. Regardless of gossip type (positive versus negative) or relationship type (friend versus stranger) the gossipers were rated as less trustworthy after sharing the gossip.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, M. M., Mazur, M.A., Wendel, N. &amp; Winslow, R. (2003). Relationship ruin or social glue? The joint effect of relationship type and gossip valence on liking, trust, and expertise. Communication Monographs, 70, 129-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Block, palton Walter ([1976], 1991, 2008). ''[[Defending the Undefendable]]: The Pimp, Prostitute, Scab, Slumlord, Libeler, Moneylender, and Other Scapegoats in the Rogue’s Gallery of American Society'' Auburn, AL: Ludwig von Mises Institute, {{ISBN|978-1-933550-17-6}}, pp. 42-43, [full text online]&lt;/ref&gt; Block has suggested that while gossip and [[blackmail]] both involve the disclosure of unflattering information, the blackmailer is arguably ethically superior to the gossip.

Block writes, "In a sense, the gossip is much ''worse'' than the blackmailer, for the blackmailer has given the blackmailed a chance to silence him. The gossip exposes the secret without warning." The victim of a blackmailer is thus offered choices denied to the subject of gossip, such as deciding if the exposure of his or her secret is worth the cost the blackmailer demands. Moreover, in refusing a blackmailer's offer one is in no worse a position than with the gossip.  Adds Block, "It is indeed difficult, then, to account for the vilification suffered by the blackmailer, at least compared to the gossip, who is usually dismissed with slight contempt and smugness."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26003">A '''gravity turn''' or '''zero-lift turn''' is a maneuver used in launching a spacecraft into, or descending from, an [[orbit]] around a celestial body such as a [[planet]] or a [[Natural satellite|moon]]. It is a [[trajectory optimization]] that uses [[gravity]] to steer the vehicle onto its desired trajectory. It offers two main advantages over a trajectory controlled solely through the vehicle's own [[thrust]]. First, the thrust is not used to change the spacecraft's direction, so more of it is used to accelerate the vehicle into orbit. Second, and more importantly, during the initial ascent phase the vehicle can maintain low or even zero [[angle of attack]].  This minimizes transverse aerodynamic [[Stress (physics)|stress]] on the launch vehicle, allowing for a lighter launch vehicle.&lt;ref name=space-sourcebook&gt;{{Cite book | last = Glasstone | first = Samuel | title = Sourcebook on the Space Sciences | publisher = D.

The term gravity turn can also refer to the use of a planet's gravity to change a spacecraft's direction in situations other than entering or leaving the orbit.&lt;ref name=mars-nonstop&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Mars Nonstop Round-Trip Trajectories | last = Luidens | first = Roger W. | year = 1964 | journal = American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 368–370 | url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=431657&amp;id=1&amp;qs=Ntt%3D%2522Mars%252BNonstop%252BRound-Trip%252BTrajectories%2522%26Ntk%3Dall%26Ntx%3Dmode%2520matchall%26N%3D0%26Ns%3DHarvestDate%257c1 | doi=10.2514/3.2330| bibcode = 1964AIAAJ...2..368L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When used in this context, it is similar to a [[gravitational slingshot]]; the difference is that a gravitational slingshot often increases or decreases spacecraft velocity and changes direction, while the gravity turn only changes direction.

==Launch procedure==

===Vertical climb===
[[File:Gravity turn - phase 1.svg|thumb|200px|A diagram showing the velocity vectors for times &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t+1&lt;/math&gt; during the vertical climb phase. The launch vehicle's new velocity is the vector sum of its old velocity, the acceleration from thrust, and the acceleration of gravity. More formally &lt;math&gt;V_{t+1} = V_{t} + ( a_\text{thrust} + a_\text{gravity} ) \cdot \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;]]
The gravity turn is commonly used with launch vehicles such as a rocket or the [[Space Shuttle]] that launch vertically.  The rocket begins by flying straight up, gaining both vertical speed and altitude.  During this portion of the launch, gravity acts directly against the thrust of the rocket, lowering its vertical acceleration. Losses associated with this slowing are known as [[gravity drag]], and can be minimized by executing the next phase of the launch, the '''pitchover maneuver''', as soon as possible.  The pitchover should also be carried out while the vertical velocity is small to avoid large aerodynamic loads on the vehicle during the maneuver.&lt;ref name=space-sourcebook/&gt;

The pitchover maneuver consists of the rocket gimbaling its engine slightly to direct some of its thrust to one side.  This force creates a net torque on the ship, turning it so that it no longer points vertically.  The pitchover angle varies with the launch vehicle and is included in the rocket's [[Inertial navigation system|inertial guidance system]].&lt;ref name=space-sourcebook/&gt; For some vehicles it is only a few degrees, while other vehicles use relatively large angles (a few tens of degrees).  After the pitchover is complete, the engines are reset to point straight down the axis of the rocket again. This small steering maneuver is the only time during an ideal gravity turn ascent that thrust must be used for purposes of steering.  The pitchover maneuver serves two purposes.  First, it turns the rocket slightly so that its flight path is no longer vertical, and second, it places the rocket on the correct [[Course (navigation)|heading]] for its ascent to orbit.  After the pitchover, the rocket's angle of attack is adjusted to zero for the remainder of its climb to orbit.  This zeroing of the angle of attack reduces lateral aerodynamic loads and produces negligible lift force during the ascent.&lt;ref name=space-sourcebook/&gt;

===Downrange acceleration===
[[File:Gravity turn - phase 2.svg|thumb|left|200px|A diagram showing the velocity vectors for times &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t+1&lt;/math&gt; during the downrange acceleration phase. As before, the launch vehicle's new velocity is the vector sum of its old velocity, the acceleration from thrust, and the acceleration of gravity. Because gravity acts straight down, the new velocity vector is closer to being level with the horizon; gravity has "turned" the trajectory downward.]]
After the pitchover, the rocket's flight path is no longer completely vertical, so gravity acts to turn the flight path back towards the ground.  If the rocket were not producing thrust, the flight path would be a simple [[ellipse]] like a thrown ball (it's a common mistake to think it is a parabola: this is only true if it is assumed that the Earth is flat, and gravity always points in the same direction, which is a good approximation for short distances), leveling off and then falling back to the ground.  The rocket is producing thrust though, and rather than leveling off and then descending again, by the time the rocket levels off, it has gained sufficient altitude and velocity to place it in a stable orbit.

If the rocket is a [[multi-stage]] system where stages fire sequentially, the rocket's ascent burn may not be continuous.  Obviously, some time must be allowed for stage separation and engine ignition between each successive stage, but some rocket designs call for extra free-flight time between stages.  This is particularly useful in very high thrust rockets, where if the engines were fired continuously, the rocket would run out of fuel before leveling off and reaching a stable orbit above the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=thesis/&gt;  The technique is also useful when launching from a planet with a thick atmosphere, such as the Earth.  Because gravity turns the flight path during free flight, the rocket can use a smaller initial pitchover angle, giving it higher vertical velocity, and taking it out of the atmosphere more quickly.  This reduces both aerodynamic drag as well as aerodynamic stress during launch.  Then later during the flight the rocket coasts between stage firings, allowing it to level off above the atmosphere, so when the engine fires again, at zero angle of attack, the thrust accelerates the ship horizontally, inserting it into orbit.

==Descent and landing procedure==
Because heat shields and parachutes cannot be used to land on an airless body such as the [[Moon]], a powered descent with a gravity turn is a good alternative.  The [[Apollo program|Apollo]] [[lunar module]] used a slightly modified gravity turn to land from lunar orbit.  This was essentially a launch in reverse except that a landing spacecraft is lightest at the surface while a spacecraft being launched is heaviest at the surface. A computer program called Lander that simulated gravity turn landings applied this concept by simulating a gravity turn launch with a negative mass flow rate, i.e. the propellant tanks filled during the rocket burn.&lt;ref name=lander-manual&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Lander Program Manual | last = Eagle Engineering, Inc | date = September 30, 1988 | journal = NASA Contract Number NAS9-17878 | volume = EEI Report 88-195 | hdl = 2060/19890005786}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of using a gravity turn maneuver to land a vehicle was originally developed for the [[Surveyor program|Lunar Surveyor]] landings, although Surveyor made a direct approach to the surface without first going into lunar orbit.&lt;ref name="Boeing Satellite Development: Surveyor Mission Overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/scientific/surveyor/surveyor.html |title=Boeing Satellite Development: Surveyor Mission Overview |publisher=Boeing |work=boeing.com |accessdate=31 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207072958/http://boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/scientific/surveyor/surveyor.html |archivedate=7 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deorbit and reentry===
[[File:Gravity turn - landing - phase 1.svg|thumb|right|200px|The deorbit, coast, and possible reentry phase leading up to the beginning of the final landing burn.]]
The vehicle begins by orienting for a retrograde burn to reduce its [[Orbital speed|orbital velocity]], lowering its point of [[periapsis]] to near the surface of the body to be landed on.  If the craft is landing on a planet with an atmosphere such as [[Mars]] the deorbit burn will only lower periapsis into the upper layers of the atmosphere, rather than just above the surface as on an airless body.  After the deorbit burn is complete the vehicle can either coast until it is nearer to its landing site or continue firing its engine while maintaining zero angle of attack.  For a planet with an atmosphere the coast portion of the trip includes [[Atmospheric entry|reentry through the atmosphere]] as well.

After the coast and possible reentry the vehicle jettisons any no longer necessary [[heat shield]]s and/or parachutes in preparation for the final landing burn.  If the atmosphere is thick enough it can be used to slow the vehicle a considerable amount, thus saving on fuel.  In this case a gravity turn is not the optimal entry trajectory but it does allow for approximation of the true [[delta-v]] required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference|first=Robert D. |last=Braun |author2=Manning, Robert M. |title=Mars Exploration Entry, Descent and Landing Challenges |year=2006 |conference=IEEE Aerospace Conference |url=http://www.ssdl.gatech.edu/Papers/Technical%20Papers/IEEE%20Paper%2006%20ID0076%20FINAL.pdf |doi=10.1109/AERO.2006.1655790 |pages=1 |format= |isbn=0-7803-9545-X |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903114838/http://www.ssdl.gatech.edu/Papers/Technical%20Papers/IEEE%20Paper%2006%20ID0076%20FINAL.pdf |archivedate=September 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case where there is no atmosphere however, the landing vehicle must provide the full delta-v necessary to land safely on the surface.

===Landing===
[[File:Gravity turn - landing - phase 2.svg|thumb|left|200px|The final approach and landing portion of the descent. The vehicle loses horizontal speed while transitioning to a vertical hover, allowing it to settle down on the surface.]]
If it is not already properly oriented, the vehicle lines up its engines to fire directly opposite its current surface velocity vector, which at this point is either parallel to the ground or only slightly vertical, as shown to the left.  The vehicle then fires its landing engine to slow down for landing. As the vehicle loses horizontal velocity the gravity of the body to be landed on will begin pulling the trajectory closer and closer to a vertical descent.  In an ideal maneuver on a perfectly spherical body the vehicle could reach zero horizontal velocity, zero vertical velocity, and zero altitude all at the same moment, landing safely on the surface (if the body is not rotating; else the horizontal velocity shall be made equal to the one of the body at the considered latitude).  However, due to rocks and uneven surface terrain the vehicle usually picks up a few degrees of angle of attack near the end of the maneuver to zero its horizontal velocity just above the surface.  This process is the mirror image of the pitch over maneuver used in the launch procedure and allows the vehicle to hover straight down, landing gently on the surface.

==Guidance and control==
The steering of a rocket's course during its flight is divided into two separate components; [[Control system|control]], the ability to point the rocket in a desired direction, and [[Guidance system|guidance]], the determination of what direction a rocket should be pointed to reach a given target.  The desired target can either be a location on the ground, as in the case of a [[ballistic missile]], or a particular orbit, as in the case of a launch vehicle.

===Launch===
The gravity turn trajectory is most commonly used during early ascent. The guidance program is a precalculated lookup table of pitch vs time. Control is done with engine gimballing and/or aerodynamic control surfaces.  The pitch program maintains a zero angle of attack (the definition of a gravity turn) until the vacuum of space is reached, thus minimizing lateral aerodynamic loads on the vehicle. (Excessive aerodynamic loads can quickly destroy the vehicle.)  Although the preprogrammed pitch schedule is adequate for some applications, an adaptive [[inertial guidance system]] that determines location, orientation and velocity with [[accelerometers]] and [[gyroscope]]s, is almost always employed on modern rockets.  The [[United Kingdom|British]] satellite launcher [[Black Arrow]] was an example of a rocket that flew a preprogrammed pitch schedule, making no attempt to correct for errors in its trajectory, while the Apollo-Saturn rockets used "closed loop" inertial guidance after the gravity turn through the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=TM:74948&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Launch vehicle handbook. Compilation of launch vehicle performance and weight data for preliminary planning purposes | date = September 1961 | publisher = [[NASA]] | journal = NASA Technical Memorandum | volume = TM 74948 | url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=841072&amp;id=1&amp;qs=Ntt%3D%2522Launch%252Bvehicle%252Bhandbook.%252BCompilation%252Bof%252Blaunch%252Bvehicle%252Bperformance%252Band%252Bweight%252Bdata%252Bfor%252Bpreliminary%252Bplanning%252Bpurposes%2522%26Ntk%3Dall%26Ntx%3Dmode%2520matchall%26N%3D0%26Ns%3DHarvestDate%257c1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial pitch program is an [[Open-loop controller|open-loop]] system subject to errors from winds, thrust variations, etc.  To maintain zero angle of attack during atmospheric flight, these errors are not corrected until reaching space.&lt;ref name=TM:X-881&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Apollo systems description. Volume 2 - Saturn launch vehicles | date = February 1964 | publisher = [[NASA]] | journal = NASA Technical Memorandum | volume = TM X-881 | hdl = 2060/19710065502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then a more sophisticated [[Control theory#Classical control theory: the closed-loop controller|closed-loop guidance]] program can take over to correct trajectory deviations and attain the desired orbit.  In the Apollo missions, the transition to closed-loop guidance took place early in second stage flight after maintaining a fixed inertial attitude while jettisoning the first stage and interstage ring.&lt;ref name=TM:X-881/&gt;  Because the upper stages of a rocket operate in a near vacuum, fins are ineffective. Steering relies entirely on engine gimballing and a [[reaction control system]].

===Landing===
To serve as an example of how the gravity turn can be used for a powered landing, an Apollo type [[Apollo Lunar Module|lander]] on an airless body will be assumed.  The lander begins in a circular orbit docked to the command module.  After separation from the command module the lander performs a retrograde burn to lower its periapsis to just above the surface.  It then coasts to periapsis where the engine is restarted to perform the gravity turn descent.  It has been shown that in this situation guidance can be achieved by maintaining a constant angle between the thrust vector and the line of sight to the orbiting command module.&lt;ref name=TN:D-2520&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Application of a Lunar Landing Technique for Landing from an Elliptic Orbit Established by a Hohmann Transfer | first = L.

Keith | last = Barker |author2=Queijo, M. J. | date = June 1964 | publisher = [[NASA]] | journal = Nasa Technical Note | volume = TN D-2298 | hdl = 2060/19640013320}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study concluded that using the command module provides the best visual reference, as it maintains a near constant visual separation from an ideal gravity turn until the landing is almost complete.  Because the vehicle is landing in a vacuum, aerodynamic control surfaces are useless.  Therefore, a system such as a gimballing main engine, a reaction control system, or possibly a [[control moment gyroscope]] must be used for attitude control.

==Limitations==
Although gravity turn trajectories use minimal steering thrust they are not always the most efficient possible launch or landing procedure. Several things can affect the gravity turn procedure making it less efficient or even impossible due to the design limitations of the launch vehicle. A brief summary of factors affecting the turn is given below.

*[[Atmosphere]] — In order to minimize [[gravity drag]] the vehicle should begin gaining horizontal speed as soon as possible. On an airless body such as the Moon this presents no problem, however on a planet with a dense atmosphere this is not possible. A trade-off exists between flying higher before starting downrange acceleration, thus increasing gravity drag losses; or starting downrange acceleration earlier, reducing gravity drag but increasing the aerodynamic drag experienced during launch.
*[[max Q|Maximum dynamic pressure]] — Another effect related to the planet's atmosphere is the maximum dynamic pressure exerted on the launch vehicle during the launch. [[Dynamic pressure]] is related to both the atmospheric density and the vehicle's speed through the atmosphere. Just after liftoff the vehicle is gaining speed and increasing dynamic pressure faster than the reduction in atmospheric density can decrease the dynamic pressure. This causes the dynamic pressure exerted on the vehicle to increase until the two rates are equal. This is known as the point of maximum dynamic pressure (abbreviated "[[max Q]]"), and the launch vehicle must be built to withstand this amount of stress during launch. As before a trade off exists between gravity drag from flying higher first to avoid the thicker atmosphere when accelerating; or accelerating more at lower altitude, resulting in a heavier launch vehicle because of a higher maximum dynamic pressure experienced on launch.
*Maximum engine [[thrust]] — The maximum thrust the rocket engine can produce affects several aspects of the gravity turn procedure. Firstly, before the pitch over maneuver the vehicle must be capable of not only overcoming the force of gravity but accelerating upwards. The more acceleration the vehicle has beyond the acceleration of gravity the quicker vertical speed can be obtained allowing for lower gravity drag in the initial launch phase. When the pitch over is executed the vehicle begins its downrange acceleration phase; engine thrust affects this phase as well. Higher thrust allows for a faster acceleration to orbital velocity as well. By reducing this time the rocket can level off sooner; further reducing gravity drag losses. Although higher thrust can make the launch more efficient, accelerating too much low in the atmosphere increases the maximum dynamic pressure. This can be alleviated by throttling the engines back during the beginning of downrange acceleration until the vehicle has climbed higher. However, with solid fuel rockets this may not be possible.
*Maximum tolerable [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] acceleration — Another limitation related to engine thrust is the maximum acceleration that can be safely sustained by the crew and/or the payload. Near main engine cut off (MECO) when the launch vehicle has consumed most of its fuel it will be much lighter than it was at launch. If the engines are still producing the same amount of thrust, the acceleration will grow as a result of the decreasing vehicle mass. If this acceleration is not kept in check by throttling back the engines, injury to the crew or damage to the payload could occur. This forces the vehicle to spend more time gaining horizontal velocity, increasing gravity drag.

==Use in orbital redirection==
For spacecraft missions where large changes in the direction of flight are necessary, direct propulsion by the spacecraft may not be feasible due to the large delta-v requirement.  In these cases it may be possible to perform a flyby of a nearby planet or moon, using its gravitational attraction to alter the ship's direction of flight.  Although this maneuver is very similar to the [[gravitational slingshot]] it differs in that a slingshot often implies a change in both speed and direction whereas the gravity turn only changes the direction of flight.

A variant of this maneuver, the [[free return trajectory]] allows the spacecraft to depart from a planet, circle another planet once, and return to the starting planet using propulsion only during the initial departure burn.  Although in theory it is possible to execute a perfect free return trajectory, in practice small correction burns are often necessary during the flight.  Even though it does not require a burn for the return trip, other return trajectory types, such as an aerodynamic turn, can result in a lower total delta-v for the mission.&lt;ref name=mars-nonstop/&gt;

==Use in spaceflight==
Many spaceflight missions have utilized the gravity turn, either directly or in a modified form, to carry out their missions.  What follows is a short list of various mission that have used this procedure.

*[[Surveyor program]] — A precursor to the Apollo Program, the Surveyor Program's primary mission objective was to develop the ability to perform soft landings on the surface of the moon, through the use of an automated descent and landing program built into the lander.&lt;ref name=AAS:04-062&gt;{{Cite conference | title = ''Surveyor'' Spacecraft Automatic Landing System | first = Sam W. | last = Thurman | date = February 2004 | conference = 27th Annual AAS Guidance and Control Conference | url = http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/handle/2014/38026?mode=full | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227050234/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/handle/2014/38026?mode=full | archivedate = 2008-02-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the landing procedure can be classified as a gravity turn descent, it differs from the technique most commonly employed in that it was shot from the Earth directly to the lunar surface, rather than first orbiting the moon as the Apollo landers did.  Because of this the descent path was nearly vertical, although some "turning" was done by gravity during the landing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
*[[Apollo program]] — Launches of the [[Saturn V]] rocket during the Apollo program were carried out using a gravity turn in order to minimize lateral stress on the rocket.  At the other end of their journey, the lunar landers utilized a gravity turn landing and ascent from the moon.

==Mathematical description==
The simplest case of the gravity turn trajectory is that which describes a point mass vehicle, in a uniform gravitational field, neglecting air resistance.  The thrust force &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector whose magnitude is a function of time and whose direction can be varied at will.  Under these assumptions the differential equation of motion is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;m \frac{d \vec{v}}{dt} = \vec{F} - mg \hat{k}\;.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\hat{k}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector in the vertical direction and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the instantaneous vehicle mass.  By constraining the thrust vector to point parallel to the velocity and separating the equation of motion into components parallel to &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; and those perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; we arrive at the following system:&lt;ref name=universal&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Universal Gravity Turn Trajectories | first = Glen J. | last = Culler |author2=Fried, Burton D. | journal = Journal of Applied Physics | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | date = June 1957 | pages = 672–676 | url = http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=JAPIAU000028000006000672000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes | doi = 10.1063/1.1722828|bibcode = 1957JAP....28..672C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{v} &amp;= g(n - \cos{\beta}) \;,\\
v \dot{\beta} &amp;= g \sin{\beta}\;. \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

Here the current thrust to weight ratio has been denoted by &lt;math&gt;n = F/mg&lt;/math&gt; and the current angle between the velocity vector and the vertical by &lt;math&gt;\beta = \arccos{(\vec{\tau_1} \cdot \hat{k})}&lt;/math&gt;. This results in a coupled system of equations which can be integrated to obtain the trajectory. However, for all but the simplest case of constant &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; over the entire flight, the equations cannot be solved [[Closed-form expression|analytically]] and must be [[Numerical integration|integrated numerically]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11405">The '''Handschu agreement''' is a set of guidelines that regulate police behavior in [[New York City]] with regard to political activity.

==Background==
In 1971, 21 members of the [[Black Panther Party]] were tried for conspiracy to blow up police stations and department stores. They were acquitted of all charges after only 90 minutes of jury deliberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LOkYzy4t2VEC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=1971+new+york+panther+21+acquitted&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=awUaLAZn0z&amp;sig=_oyKmE0C-cSVljTz7DF9PDo56S0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1ShGUrm9E-GkyQGQyoHwAg&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCTge#v=onepage&amp;q=1971%20new%20york%20panther%2021%20acquitted&amp;f=false | title =Warfare in the American Homeland: Policing and Prison in a Penal Democracy | author =Joy James | author2 =''[[Duke University]]'' | isbn =978-0822339236 | pages =74 | publisher =books.google.com | year =2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial revealed the extent to which the NYPD had infiltrated and kept dossiers on not only the Black Panthers and other radical groups, but also on [[anti-war]] groups, [[gay rights]] activists, educational reform advocates, religious groups, and civic organizations.&lt;ref name ="ApuzzoGoldberg"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UWBLg4JRmAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20panther&amp;f=false | title =Enemies Within: Inside the NYPD's Secret Spying Unit and bin Laden's Final Plot Against America | author =Matt Apuzzo, Adam Goldberg| author2 =''[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]'' | isbn =978-1476727936 | pages =44 | publisher =books.google.com | year =2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Handschu agreement, or decree, was the result of a [[class-action lawsuit]] filed against the City of New York, its Police Commissioner and the Intelligence Division of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) on behalf of [[Barbara Handschu]] and fifteen other [[plaintiffs]] affiliated with various political or ideological associations and organizations, known as ''Handschu v. Special Services Division'', 605 F.Supp. 1384, affirmed 787 F.2d 828.&lt;ref name ="HandschuNYTimes"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://graphics.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20070215_nycruling.pdf | title =Handschu v. Special Services Division | author =''[[New York Times]]'' | publisher =nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaintiffs claimed that "informers and infiltrators provoked, solicited and induced members of lawful political and social groups to engage in unlawful activities"; that files were maintained with respect to "persons, places, and activities entirely unrelated to legitimate law enforcement purposes, such as those attending meetings of lawful organizations"; and that information from these files was made available to academic institutions, prospective employers, licensing agencies and others. In addition, plaintiffs protested seven types of police misconduct: (1) the use of informers; (2) infiltration; (3) interrogation; (4) overt surveillance; (5) summary punishment; (6) intelligence gathering; and (7) electronic surveillance, and alleged that these police practices which punished and repressed lawful dissent had had a "chilling effect" upon the exercise of freedom of speech, assembly and association, that they violated constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures, and that they abridged rights of privacy and due process.&lt;ref name="Arthur N. Eisenberg"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nyclu.org/content/testimony-police-surveillance-of-political-activity-history-and-current-state-of-handschu-de| author=Arthur N. Eisenberg| title=Testimony: Police Surveillance of Political Activity -- The History and Current State of the Handschu Decree| publisher=New York Civil Liberties Union| accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the court found that police surveillance of political activity violated [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] protections of [[free speech]].&lt;ref name ="HandschuNYTimes"/&gt; This ruling resulted in a [[consent decree]] which prohibited the NYPD from engaging "in any investigation of political activity except through the … Intelligence Division [of the Police Department]" and required that any "such investigations shall be conducted" only in accordance with the Guidelines incorporated into the Decree. The Guidelines further prohibited the Intelligence Division from "commencing an investigation" into the political, ideological or religious activities of an individual or group unless "specific information has been received by the Police Department that a person or group engaged in political activity is engaged in, about to engage in or has threatened to engage in conduct which constitutes a crime…."&lt;ref name="Arthur N. Eisenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/24/nypd-intelligence-chief-agents-mosque | title =NYPD intelligence chief wanted sources in every mosque within 250 miles | author =Ryan Devereaux | publisher =theguardian.com | date =February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
According to the terms of the agreement, purely political activity can only be investigated by the Public Security Section (PSS) of the NYPD's Intelligence Division, and then only when the Section suspects criminal activity. When the PSS does suspect criminal activity on the part of political groups, it must obtain a warrant from the three-person Handschu Authority, a commission made up of two deputy commissioners and a mayor-appointed civilian.

The agreement also prohibits indiscriminate police videorecording and photographing of public gatherings when there is no indication that unlawful activity is occurring.

The department is also prohibited from sharing information pertaining to political activity with other law enforcement agencies unless those agencies agree to abide by the terms of the Handschu agreement.

The court order mandates the compiling of annual, publicly available reports listing the surveillance requests made by the NYPD and the number of such requests granted.

==Current status==
In 2002, the NYPD asked federal judge [[Charles S. Haight, Jr.]], the judge who presided over the original case, to abrogate numerous provisions of the agreement, claiming that they inhibited the department's ability to prevent future [[terrorist]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The department also requested that the function of the Handschu authority be changed to investigating complaints of constitutional violations, which would take away the authority's power to oversee political investigations.

In regards to the requested changes, Police Commissioner [[Raymond W. Kelly]] said, "Today we live in a more dangerous, constantly changing world, one with challenges and threats that were never envisioned when the Handschu guidelines were written."&lt;ref name="NYT2002"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/nyregion/threats-responses-surveillance-police-ask-change-rules-ease-restrictions.html | title =THREATS AND RESPONSES: SURVEILLANCE; Police Ask to Change the Rules and Ease Restrictions on Political Investigations | author =Kevin Flynn, Jacob H.

Chris Dunn of the New York [[American Civil Liberties Union|Civil Liberties Union]], called the proposal "troubling," stating that the NYPD "has no legitimate reason to spy on lawful political activity."&lt;ref name="NYT2002"/&gt;

Former New York City mayor [[Ed Koch]], previously a critic of police surveillance, agreed with the proposal to rescind large portions of the Handschu agreement. "That's the necessary cost of protecting the public in these times where we're dealing with terrorism," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On February 11, 2003, Haight ruled that the NYPD should be permitted to modify the 1985 Decree, but not to the extent originally requested by the City. The judge instructed the city to adapt the [[U.S. Attorney General]]'s Guidelines on General Crimes, Racketeering Enterprise and Terrorism Enterprise Investigations, issued by Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] in May, 2002. This weakened the original decree in that a preliminary inquiry could be initiated when there is "information … which indicates the possibility of criminal activity."&lt;ref name="Arthur N. Eisenberg"/&gt;

In February 2007, [[Charles S. Haight, Jr.|Judge Haight]] ruled that the NYPD had violated the terms of the agreement by videotaping two demonstrations by advocates of the [[homeless]], one in [[Harlem]] in March 2005, the other in front of New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]'s house in December 2005. On June 13, 2007, Haight reversed the ruling, saying that attorneys for the city had provided new evidence indicating that the protestors may have been "disorderly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5659">In [[mathematics]], in the fields of [[multilinear algebra]] and [[representation theory]], '''invariants of tensors''' are coefficients of the [[characteristic polynomial]] of the [[tensor]] ''A'':&lt;ref&gt;SPENCER, A. J. M. Continuum Mechanics. Longman, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ p(\lambda):=\det (\mathbf{A}-\lambda \mathbf{E})&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the identity tensor and &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is the polynomial's [[Indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] (it is important to bear in mind that a polynomial's indeterminate &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; may also be a non-scalar as long as power, scaling and adding make sense for it, e.g., &lt;math&gt;p(\mathbf{A})&lt;/math&gt; is legitimate, and in fact, quite useful).

The first invariant of an ''n''&amp;times;''n'' tensor A (&lt;math&gt;I_A&lt;/math&gt;) is the coefficient for &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; (because the coefficient for &lt;math&gt; \lambda^n &lt;/math&gt; is always 1), the second invariant (&lt;math&gt;II_A&lt;/math&gt;) is the coefficient for &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;, etc., the ''n''th invariant is the free term.

==Properties==
The first invariant (trace) is always the sum of the diagonal components:
:&lt;math&gt;\ I_A=A_{11}+A_{22}+ \cdots + A_{nn}=\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{A}) \, &lt;/math&gt;
The ''n''th invariant is just &lt;math&gt;\pm \det \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;, the determinant of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; (up to sign).

The invariants do not change with rotation of the coordinate system (they are objective). Obviously, any function of the invariants only is also objective.

==Calculation of the invariants of symmetric 3&amp;times;3 tensors==
Most [[Application of tensor theory in engineering science|tensors used in engineering]] are symmetric 3&amp;times;3.
For this case  the invariants can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathrm{I}_A= \mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{A}) = A_{11}+A_{22}+A_{33} = A_1+A_2+A_3 \,
 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{II}_A  = \frac{1}{2} \left( ( \mathrm{tr}\mathbf{A})^2 - \mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{A}^2 ) \right) = A_{11}A_{22}+A_{22}A_{33}+A_{11}A_{33}-A_{12}A_{21}-A_{23}A_{32}-A_{13}A_{31}
&lt;/math&gt;

(the sum of [[principal minor]]s).  This expression holds for non-symmetric tensors. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=PA|url=http://homepages.engineering.auckland.ac.nz/~pkel015/SolidMechanicsBooks/Part_III/Chapter_1_Vectors_Tensors/Vectors_Tensors_11_Eigenvalue.pdf|website=Lecture Notes: An introduction to Solid Mechanics|accessdate=27 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; = A_1A_2+A_2A_3+A_1A_3 \\
\mathrm{III}_A &amp; = \det (\mathbf{A})= A_1 A_2 A_3
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_3&lt;/math&gt; are the [[eigenvalues]] of tensor&amp;nbsp;''A''.

Because of the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]] the following equation is always true:
:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathbf{A}^3 - \mathrm{I}_A \mathbf{A}^2 +\mathrm{II}_A \mathbf{A} -\mathrm{III}_A \mathbf{E}= 0&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'' is the second-order identity tensor.

A similar equation holds for tensors of higher order.

==Engineering application==
A scalar valued tensor function ''f'' that depends merely on the three invariants of a symmetric 3&amp;times;3 tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is objective, i.e., independent from rotations of the coordinate system. Moreover, every objective tensor function depends only on the tensor's invariants. Thus, objectivity of a tensor function is fulfilled if, and only if, for some function &lt;math&gt;\ g:R^3\to R &lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;\ f(\mathbf A)=g(I_A,II_A,III_A). \, &lt;/math&gt;

A common application to this is the evaluation of the potential energy as function of the strain tensor, within the framework of linear elasticity. Exhausting the above theorem the free energy of the system reduces to a function of 3 scalar parameters rather than 6. Within linear elasticity the free energy has to be quadratic in the tensor's elements, which eliminates an additional scalar. Thus, for an isotropic material only two independent parameters are needed to describe the elastic properties, known as Lamé coefficients. Consequently, experimental fits and computational efforts may be eased significantly.

This technique was first introduced into isotropic [[turbulence]] by [[Howard P. Robertson]] in 1940&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, H. P. (1940, April). The invariant theory of isotropic turbulence. In Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (Vol. 36, No. 2, pp. 209-223). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was able to derive [[Kármán–Howarth equation]] from the invariant principle. [[George Batchelor]] and [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] exploited this technique by extending to axisymmetric turbulence&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor, G. K. (1946). The theory of axisymmetric turbulence. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, 186(1007), 480-502.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1950). The theory of axisymmetric turbulence. Royal Society of London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1950). The decay of axisymmetric turbulence. Proc. Roy. Soc. A, 203, 358-364.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Other invariants==

Since the invariants are constant in any reference, functions of invariants are also constant. Some sources define the three invariants of the 3&amp;times;3 tensors as

:&lt;math&gt;I_1 = tr(\mathbf{A}) = A_{ii}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_2 = tr(\mathbf{A}^2) = A_{ij}A_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;  This expression only holds for symmetric tensors.
:&lt;math&gt;I_3 = tr(\mathbf{A}^3) = A_{ij}A_{jk}A_{ki}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;I_A = I_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;II_A = \frac{1}{2}(I_1^2 - I_2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;III_A = \frac{1}{6}(I_1^3 - 3 I_1 I_2 + 2 I_3)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Java Man''' (''Homo erectus erectus''; Javanese: Manungsa Jawa; Indonesian: Manusia Jawa) is [[early human]] fossils discovered on the island of [[Java]] ([[Indonesia]]) in 1891 and 1892. Led by [[Eugène Dubois]], the excavation team uncovered a [[tooth]], a [[Calvaria (skull)|skullcap]], and a [[femur|thighbone]] at [[Trinil]] on the banks of the [[Solo River]] in [[East Java]]. Arguing that the [[fossil]]s represented the "[[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]]" between apes and humans, Dubois gave the species the [[scientific name]] ''[[Anthropopithecus|Anthropopithecus erectus]]'', then later renamed it ''Pithecanthropus erectus''.

The fossil aroused much controversy. Less than ten years after 1891, almost eighty books or articles had been published on [[Early hominids in Southeast Asia|Dubois's finds]]. Despite Dubois's argument, few accepted that Java Man was a [[Transitional fossil|transitional form]] between apes and humans.{{Sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=70}} Some dismissed the fossils as [[ape]]s and others as [[Anatomically modern humans|modern human]]s, whereas many scientists considered Java Man as a primitive side branch of evolution not related to modern humans at all. In the 1930s Dubois made the claim that ''Pithecanthropus'' was built like a "giant [[gibbon]]", a much misinterpreted attempt by Dubois to prove that it was the "missing link".

Eventually, similarities between ''Pithecanthropus erectus'' (Java Man) and ''Sinanthropus pekinensis'' ([[Peking Man]]) led [[Ernst Mayr]] to rename both ''[[Homo erectus]]'' in 1950, placing them directly in the human [[Phylogenetic tree|evolutionary tree]]. To distinguish Java Man from other ''Homo erectus'' populations, some scientists began to regard it as a subspecies, ''Homo erectus erectus'', in the 1970s. Other fossils found in the first half of the twentieth century in Java at [[Sangiran]] and [[Mojokerto]], all older than those found by Dubois, are also considered part of the species ''Homo erectus''. Estimated to be between 700,000 and 1,000,000 years old, at the time of their discovery the fossils of Java Man were the oldest [[hominin]] fossils ever found. The fossils of Java Man have been housed at the [[Naturalis]] in the [[Netherlands]] since 1900.

==History of discoveries==
===Background===

[[Charles Darwin]] had argued that [[Recent African origin of modern humans#History of the theory|humanity evolved in Africa]], because this is where [[great ape]]s like [[gorillas]] and [[chimpanzees]] lived. Though Darwin's claims have since been vindicated by the [[fossil]] record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, like [[Charles Lyell]], a [[geologist]], and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], who thought of a similar [[theory of evolution]] around the same time as Darwin. Because both Lyell and Wallace believed that humans were more closely related to [[gibbon]]s and [[orangutan]]s, they identified [[Southeast Asia]] as the cradle of humanity because this is where these [[ape]]s lived. Dutch anatomist [[Eugène Dubois]] favored the latter theory, and sought to confirm it.{{sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|pp=58–59}}

In October 1887, Dubois abandoned his academic career and left for the [[Dutch East Indies]] (present-day [[Indonesia]]) to look for the fossilized ancestor of modern man.{{sfnm|1a1=Swisher|1a2=Curtis|1a3=Lewin|1y=2000|1p=58|2a1=de Vos|2y=2004|2p=270}} Having received no funding from the Dutch government for his eccentric endeavor{{spaced ndash}}since no one at the time had ever found an early human fossil while looking for it{{spaced ndash}}he joined the Dutch East Indies Army as a military surgeon.{{sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|pp=59 ["unorthodox" venture; was refused government funding; hired as medical officer] and 61 ["he was the first person to set out on a deliberate search for fossils of human ancestors"]}} Because of his work duties, it was only in July 1888 that he began to [[excavation (archaeology)|excavate]] caves in [[Sumatra]].{{sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=61}} Having quickly found abundant fossils of large mammals, Dubois was relieved of his military duties (March 1889), and the colonial government assigned two engineers and fifty convicts to help him with his excavations.{{sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|pp=61–62}} After he failed to find the fossils he was looking for on Sumatra, he moved on to Java in 1890.{{sfn|Theunissen|1989|p=41–43}}

Again assisted by convict laborers and two army sergeants, Dubois began searching along the [[Solo River]] near [[Trinil]] in August 1891.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web|title = Java Man (extinct hominid) – Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher = brittanica.com|url =http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/301721/Java-man|accessdate = 2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His team soon excavated a [[molar (tooth)|molar]] (Trinil 1) and a [[calvaria (skull)|skullcap]] (Trinil 2). Its characteristics were a long [[Human cranium|cranium]] with a [[sagittal keel]] and heavy browridge. Dubois first gave them the name ''[[Anthropopithecus]]'' ("man-ape"), as the [[chimpanzee]] was sometimes known at the time. He chose this name because a similar tooth found in the [[Siwalik Hills]] in India in 1878 had been named ''Anthropopithecus'', and because Dubois first assessed the cranium to have been about {{convert|700|cm3}}, closer to apes than to humans.

In August 1892, Dubois's team found a long [[femur]] (thighbone) shaped like a human one, suggesting that its owner had stood upright. Believing that the three fossils belonged to a single individual, "probably a very aged female", Dubois renamed the specimen ''Anthropopithecus erectus''.{{sfnm|1a1=de Vos|1y=2004|1p=272 [citation from an assessment Dubois made in 1893]|2a1=Swisher|2a2=Curtis|2a3=Lewin|2y=2000|2p=61 [name ''Anthropopithecus'']}} Only in late 1892, when he determined that the cranium measured about {{convert|900|cm3}}, did Dubois consider that his specimen was a [[transitional fossil|transitional form]] between apes and humans.{{sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=67}} In 1894,&lt;ref&gt;Mai, Larry L., Marcus Young Owl, M. Patricia Kersting.  [http://www.ured-douala.com/download/The_Cambridge_Dictionary_of_Human_Biology_And_Evolution.pdf ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Human Biology and Evolution''], Cambridge University Press 2005, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; he thus renamed it ''Pithecanthropus erectus'' ("upright ape-man"), borrowing the genus name ''[[Pithecanthropus]]'' from [[Ernst Haeckel]], who had coined it a few years earlier to refer to a supposed "missing link" between apes and humans.{{sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|pp=66–7}} This specimen has also been known as Pithecanthropus 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Images of Trinil 2 |url= http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/fossils/trinil-2 | accessdate=2013-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparisons with Peking Man===
{{further|Peking Man}}
In 1927, Canadian [[Davidson Black]] identified two fossilized teeth he had found in [[Zhoukoudian]] near [[Beijing]] as belonging to an ancient human, and named his specimen ''Sinanthropus pekinensis'', now better known as [[Peking Man]].{{sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=75}} In December 1929, the first of several skullcaps was found on the same site, and it appeared similar but slightly larger than Java Man.{{sfnm|1a1=Schmalzer|1y=2008|1pp=44–45 [date of discovery]|2a1=Swisher|2a2=Curtis|2a3=Lewin|2y=2000|pp=75–76 [resemblance to Java Man]}} [[Franz Weidenreich]], who replaced Black in China after the latter's death in 1933, argued that ''Sinanthropus'' was also a transitional fossil between apes and humans, and was in fact so similar to Java's ''Pithecanthropus'' that they should both belong to the family [[Hominidae]]. Eugène Dubois categorically refused to entertain this possibility, dismissing Peking Man as a kind of [[Neanderthal]], closer to humans than the ''Pithecanthropus'', and insisting that Pithecanthropus belonged to its own [[family (biology)|family]], the Pithecanthropoidae.{{sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|pp=74–76}}

===Other discoveries on Java===
{{further|Solo Man|Mojokerto child|Sangiran}}
After the discovery of Java Man, Berlin-born paleontologist [[Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald|G. H. R. von Koenigswald]] recovered several other early human fossils in Java. Between 1931 and 1933 von Koenigswald discovered fossils of [[Solo Man]] from sites along the [[Bengawan Solo River]] on [[Java (island)|Java]], including several skullcaps and cranial fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=Jeffrey H.|last2=Tattersall|first2=Ian|title=The Human Fossil Record, Craniodental Morphology of Genus Homo (Africa and Asia)|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=450}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, von Koenigswald discovered a juvenile skullcap known as the [[Mojokerto child]] in [[East Java]].{{sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=42}} Considering the Mojokerto child skull cap to be closely related to humans, von Koenigswald wanted to name it ''Pithecanthropus modjokertensis'' (after Dubois's specimen), but Dubois protested that Pithecanthropus was not a human but an "ape-man".&lt;ref name=theun&gt;{{cite book|last1=Theunissen|first1=Bert|title=Eugène Dubois and the Ape-Man from Java: The History of the First 'Missing Link' and Its Discoverer|date=Jan 1, 1989|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|pages=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Koenigswald also made several discoveries in [[Sangiran]], Central Java, where more fossils of early humans were discovered between 1936 and 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id_site=593|title=Sangiran Early Man Site|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the discoveries was [[Sangiran 2|a skullcap of similar size]] to that found by Dubois at the Trinil 2 site. Von Koenigswald's discoveries in [[Sangiran]] convinced him that all these skulls belonged to [[early human]]s. Dubois again refused to acknowledge the similarity. Ralph von Koenigswald and Franz Weidenreich compared the fossils from Java and Zhoukoudian and concluded that Java Man and Peking Man were closely related.&lt;ref name="theun" /&gt; Dubois died in 1940, still refusing to recognize their conclusion,{{sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|pp=76–79}}&lt;ref name="theun" /&gt; and official reports remain critical of the Sangiran site's poor presentation and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=UNESCO World Heritage Committee|title=State of conservation of properties inscribed on the World Heritage List|date=2002|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/2002/whc-02-conf202-17reve.pdf|pages=29–30|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early interpretations==
[[Image:Java man.jpg|thumb|1922 reconstruction of a Java Man skull, due to Trinil 2 being only a cranium, Dubois who believed Java man was transitional between apes and humans, drew the reconstruction with an ape-like jaw but a brain larger than apes'|alt=1922 reconstruction of a Java Man skull, due to Trinil 2 being only a cranium, Dubois who believed Java man was transitional between apes and humans, drew the reconstruction with an ape-like jaw but a brain larger than apes']]
More than 50 years after Dubois's find, [[Ralph von Koenigswald]] recollected that, "No other paleontological discovery has created such a sensation and led to such a variety of conflicting scientific opinions."{{Sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=69, citing von Koenigswald's ''Meeting Prehistoric Man'' (1956)}} The ''Pithecanthropus'' fossils were so immediately controversial that by the end of the 1890s, almost 80 publications had already discussed them.{{Sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=70}}

Until the [[Taung child]]{{spaced ndash}}the 2.8 million-year-old remains of an ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]''{{spaced ndash}}were discovered in [[South Africa]] in 1924, Dubois's and Koenigswald's discoveries were the oldest hominid remains ever found. Some scientists of the day suggested{{sfn|Schwartz|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N26AAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Dubois'+Java+Man+as+a+potential+intermediate&amp;dq=Dubois'+Java+Man+as+a+potential+intermediate&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JKS8TZyONoGKvQO2hIW9BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA]{{page needed|date=July 2014}}}} that Dubois's Java Man was a [[Transitional fossil#Missing links|potential intermediate form]] between modern humans and the common ancestor we share with the other [[great apes]]. This supposition has been confirmed[Citation needed], but the current consensus of anthropologists is that the direct ancestors of modern humans were ''African'' populations of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (possibly ''[[Homo ergaster]]''), rather than the Asian populations of the same species exemplified by Java Man and [[Peking Man]].{{sfn|Hetherington|Reid|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AAja8FTPF6QC&amp;pg=PA64 64]}}

===Missing link theory===
Dubois first published his find in 1894.&lt;ref name="Athena"&gt;[http://www.athenapub.com/13dubox1.htm ''The Discovery of Java Man in 1891''] In: Athena Review, Vol.4, no.1: Homo erectus, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Dubois's central claim was that ''Pithecanthropus'' was a [[transitional form]] between apes and humans, a so-called "[[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]]".{{sfnm|1a1=de Vos|1y=2004|1p=272|2a1=Swisher|2a2=Curtis|2a3=Lewin|2y=2000|2p=69}} Many disagreed. Some critics claimed that the bones were those of an upright walking ape, or that they belonged to a primitive human.{{sfn|de Vos|2004|p=272}} This judgment made sense at a time when an [[human evolution|evolutionary view of humanity]] had not yet been widely accepted, and scientists tended to view hominid fossils as racial variants of modern humans rather than as ancestral forms.{{sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=54}} After Dubois let a number of scientists examine the fossils in a series of conferences held in Europe in the 1890s, they started to agree that Java Man may be a transitional form after all, but most of them thought of it as "an extinct side branch" of the human tree that had indeed descended from apes, but not evolved into humans.{{sfn|de Vos|2004|pp=272–73 ["extinct side branch of human evolution"]}} This interpretation eventually imposed itself and remained dominant until the 1940s.{{sfn|Schmalzer|2008|p=258 ["While at the turn of the century a linear model of human evolution was widely accepted, from around 1910 to the 1940s, the dominant model placed fossil hominids like Java Man, Peking Man, and the Neanderthals on side branches of the family tree. These 'cousins' were understood to have become extinct, replaced by our unknown direct ancestors."]}}

[[File:Siamang 140807.jpg|thumb|The gibbon's ability to stand and walk upright made [[Eugène Dubois]] believe it was closely related to humans. This is one of the reasons why he once claimed that Java Man looked like a "giant gibbon".]]
Dubois was bitter about this and locked the fossil up in a trunk until 1923 when he showed it to Ales Hrdlicka from the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;ref name="Athena" /&gt; In response to critics who refused to accept that Java Man was a "missing link", in 1932 Dubois published a paper arguing that the Trinil bones looked like those of a "giant gibbon".{{sfnm|1a1=Theunissen|1y=1989|1p=152|2a1=Swisher|2a2=Curtis|2a3=Lewin|2y=2000|2p=68|3a1=Gould|3y=1993|3p=134}} Dubois's use of the phrase has been widely misinterpreted as a retraction,{{sfnm|1a1=Theunissen|1y=1989|1pp=152–56|2a1=Swisher|2a2=Curtis|2a3=Lewin|2y=2000|2pp=68 ["The second popular and persistent myth about Dubois and his supposed reaction to the anthropological world's largely negative assessment of ''Pithecanthropus'' as a putative missing link....

I may finally correct the last and most insidious claim of the standard legend— [that] Dubois... redesignates his once-proud ancestor as nothing but a giant gibbon."]}} but it was intended an argument to support his claim that ''Pithecanthropus'' was a transitional form.{{sfn|Gould|1993|p=136 ["Dubois's ingenious attempt to retain ''Pithecanthropus'' as a direct human ancestor has been widely misread in a precisely opposite manner as an ultimate surrender, almost comical in its transmogrification of a human forebear into a giant gibbon."]}} According to Dubois, evolution occurred by leaps, and the ancestors of humanity had doubled their [[Brain-to-body mass ratio|brain-to-body ratio]] on each leap.{{sfn|Gould|1993|pp=133–34}} To prove that Java Man was the "missing link" between apes and humans, he therefore had to show that its brain-to-body ratio was double that of apes and half that of humans. The problem was that Java Man's cranial capacity was 900 cubic centimeters, about two thirds of modern humans'.{{sfn|Gould|1993|p=135 ["Dubois desperately wanted ''Pithecanthropus'' as a direct ancestor under his evolutionary view. But the brain of Java Man ranked with embarrassing bulk at some 900 cm3, or two-thirds human volume."]}}

Like many scientists who believed that modern humans evolved "[[Out of Asia]]", Dubois thought that gibbons were closest to humans among the great apes.{{sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=74 ["In common with other anthropologists of the time, Dubois believed that the human stock was rooted in some kind of gibbonlike ancestor."]}} To preserve the proportions predicted by his theory of [[evolution of the brain|brain evolution]], Dubois argued that Java Man was shaped more like a gibbon than a human. Imagined "with longer arms and a greatly expanded chest and upper body", the Trinil creature became a gigantic ape of about {{convert|100|kg}}, but "double cephalization of the anthropoid apes in general and half that of man".{{sfn|Gould|1993|p=135 [the second citation is from Dubois's paper]}} It was therefore halfway on the path to becoming a modern human.{{sfnm|1a1=Theunissen|1y=1989|1pp=152–56|2a1=Swisher|2a2=Curtis|2a3=Lewin|2y=2000|2p=74 ["Because Dubois applied the name 'Giant Gibbon' to this creature, many people took it to mean that ... he no longer considered his ''Pithecanthropus'' to be linked to human ancestry. ...

===Reclassification as ''Homo erectus''===
{{further|Homo erectus}}
Based on Weidenreich's work and on his suggestion that ''Pithecanthropus erectus'' and ''Sinanthropus pekinensis'' were connected through a series of [[interbreeding]] populations, German biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] reclassified them both as being part of the same species: ''[[Homo erectus]]''. {{sfn|Boaz|Ciochon|2004|p=66–67}} Mayr presented his conclusion at the [[Cold Spring Harbor Symposium]] in 1950,{{sfn|Schmalzer|2008|p=98. The original paper is {{harvnb|Mayr|1950}}}} and this resulted in Dubois's ''erectus'' species being reclassified under the [[genus]] ''Homo''. As part of the reclassification, Mayr included not only ''Sinanthropus'' and ''Pithecanthropus'', but also ''Plesianthropus'', ''Paranthropus'', ''Javanthropus'', and several other genera as [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]], arguing that all human ancestors were part of a single genus (''Homo''), and that "never one more than one species of man existed on the earth at any one time".{{sfn|Delisle|2007|p=298, citing Mayr's 1950 paper}} A "revolution in taxonomy", Mayr's single-species approach to human evolution was quickly accepted.{{sfn|Boaz|Ciochon|2004|p=67}} It shaped [[paleoanthropology]] in the 1950s and lasted into the 1970s, when the African genus ''[[Australopithecus]]'' was accepted into the human [[phylogenetic tree|evolutionary tree]].{{sfnm|1a1=Schmalzer|1y=2008|1p=98 ("the "single-species" thesis to which he was committed became the theoretical foundation for paleoanthropology for years to come")|2a1=Boaz|2a2=Ciochon|2y=2004|2p=67 ("was to sweep anthropology in the 1950s"&amp;nbsp;... "Thus was born the single-species hypothesis, a powerful model that endured until the late 1970s when fossil discoveries in Africa disproved it, at least for the early part of the hominid fossil record")}}

In the 1970s a tendency developed to regard the Javanese variety of ''H. erectus'' as a subspecies, ''Homo erectus erectus'', with the Chinese variety being referred to as ''Homo erectus pekinensis''.&lt;ref&gt;Sartono, S. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=de&amp;lr=&amp;id=ejsyIZMsC9oC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA327&amp;dq=%22homo+erectus+erectus%22&amp;ots=hD_qBDWhsH&amp;sig=a2kp2FF9lX5xD7Aa8wiujxeG9Oo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22homo%20erectus%20erectus%22&amp;f=false ''Implications arising from Pithecanthropus VIII''] In: Paleoanthropology: Morphology and Paleoecology.

==Post-discovery analysis==
===Date of the fossils===
[[Image:The most ancient skeletal remains of man Plate 1.png|thumb|400px|The locality of the ''Pithecanthropus'' find, on the [[Solo River]], near [[Trinil]], Java. The two white squares show where the femur (left) and the skullcap (right) were discovered. Their discovery near flowing water was one of the many sources of controversy that surrounded the fossils.]]

{{further|Stratigraphy (archaeology)}}

Dubois's complete collection of fossils were transferred between 1895 and 1900 to what is now known as the [[Naturalis]], in [[Leiden]] in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Vois|first1=John|title=The Dubois collection: a new look at an old collection|url=http://www.repository.naturalis.nl/document/43875|website=Naturalis.nl|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main fossil of Java Man, the skullcap cataloged as "Trinil 2", has been dated [[biostratigraphy|biostratigraphically]], that is, by correlating it with a group of fossilized animals (a "[[faunal assemblage]]") found nearby on the same [[horizon (geology)|geological horizon]], which is itself compared with assemblages from other layers and classified chronologically. Ralph von Koenigswald first assigned Java Man to the [[Trinil Fauna]], a faunal assemblage that he composed from several Javanese sites.{{sfn|de Vos|2004|p=275}} He concluded that the skullcap was about 700,000 years old, thus dating from the beginning of the [[Middle Pleistocene]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kaifu et al.|1y=2010|1p=145|2a1=de Vos|2y=2004|2pp=274–75}}

Though this view is still widely accepted, in the 1980s a group of Dutch [[paleontology|paleontologists]] used Dubois's collection of more than 20,000 animal fossils to reassess the date of the layer in which Java Man was found.{{sfn|Kaifu et al.|2010|p=145}} Using only fossils from Trinil, they called that new faunal assemblage the [[Trinil H. K. Fauna]], in which H. K. stands for ''Haupt Knochenschicht'', or "main fossil-bearing layer".{{sfnm|1a1=de Vos|1y=2004|1pp=275–76 [explanation of the Trinil H. K. Fauna]|2a1=Zaim|2y=2010|2p=103 [Trinil H. K. Fauna, citing {{harvnb|de Vos et al.|1982}} and {{harvnb|de Vos|Sondaar|1994}}]}} This assessment dates the fossils of Java Man to between 900,000 and 1,000,000 years old.{{sfn|Dennell|2010|p=155}} (Work published in 2014 gives a "maximum age of 0.54 ± 0.10 million years and a minimum age of 0.43 ± 0.05 million years" for Ar-Ar and luminescence dating of sediment in human-predated shell material from Trinil. "Homo erectus at Trinil on Java used shells for tool production and engraving" Joordens et al., 2014, Nature online publishing; work continues on assessing the dating of this complex site.).
Other fossils attest to the even earlier presence of ''H. erectus'' in Java. [[Sangiran 2]] (named after [[Sangiran|its discovery site]]) may be as old as 1.66 [[Megaannum|Ma]] (million years). The controversial [[Mojokerto child]], which Carl C. Swisher and [[Garniss Curtis]] once dated to 1.81 ± 0.04 Ma, has now been convincingly re-dated to a maximum age of 1.49 ± 0.13 Ma, that is, 1.49 million years with a margin of error of plus or minus 130,000 years.{{sfnm|Dennell|2009|1p=155 ["The maximum age of this specimen is thus 1.49 million years, and not 1.81 million years, as implied by {{harvnb|Swisher et al.|1994}}"]|Ciochon|2010|2p=112 ["As the relocated discovery bed proved to be ~20&amp;nbsp;m above the horizon that Swisher et al. (1994) dated, the skull is certainly younger than had been previously reported" ({{harvnb|Huffman et al.|2006}})"]|Rabett|2012|3p=26 ["the 1994 estimate of its age has now been credibly refuted (Huffman ''et al.'' 2006)"]|4a1=Dennell|4y=2010|4p=266 ["the recent re-discovery of the precise provenance of the Mojokerto cranium that is now dated to a maximum of 1.49 Ma ({{harvnb|Morwood et al.|2003}}) clarifies long-standing uncertainties over the age of this important specimen"]}}

===Type specimen===
The fossils found in Java are considered the [[type specimen]] for ''H. erectus''. Because the fossils of Java Man were found "scattered in an [[alluvial deposit]]"{{spaced ndash}}they had been laid there by the flow of a river{{spaced ndash}}detractors doubted that they belonged to the same species, let alone the same individual.{{sfn|Schmalzer|2008|p=34}} German [[pathologist]] [[Rudolf Virchow]], for instance, argued in 1895 that the femur was that of a [[gibbon]].{{sfn|Gould|1993|p=135}} Dubois had difficulty convincing his critics, because he had not attended the excavation, and could not explain specifically enough the exact location of the bones.{{sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=69}} Because the Trinil thighbone looks very much like that of a modern human, it might have been a "[[reworked fossil]]", that is, a relatively young fossil that was deposited into an older layer after its own layer had been eroded. For this reason, there is still dissent about whether all the Trinil fossils represent the same species.{{sfn||Dennell|2009|pp=159–61}}

==Physical characteristics==
[[File:Java Man.jpg|thumb|A 1922 reconstruction of the skull of Java Man (based on Trinil 2).]]
Java Man was about {{convert|5|ft|8|in|cm}} tall and his thighbones show that he [[walking|walked erect]] like modern humans.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; The femur is thicker than that of a modern human, indicating he was engaging a lot of running. &lt;ref name="Athena"/&gt; The skull was characterized by thick bones and a retreating forehead and no chin, as well as protruding [[supraorbital ridge|browridges]] and a massive jaw. With 900 ccm, his [[Brain size|cranial capacity]] was smaller than that of later ''H. erectus'' specimens. He had [[Human tooth|human teeth]] with large canines.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; Judging from anatomical and archeological aspects as well as Java Man's ecological role, meat from vertebrates was likely an important part of their diet. Java Man, like other ''Homo erectus'', was probably a rare species.&lt;ref&gt;Stom, Paul.

''H. erectus'' arrived in Eurasia approximately 1.8 million years ago, in an event considered to be the first African exodus.&lt;ref&gt;Matsubayashi, Kozo.

More specifically the environment resembled a [[savannah]], but was likely regularly inundated ("hydromorphic savanna"). The plants found at the Trinil excavation site included grass ([[Poaceae]]), [[fern]]s, ''[[Ficus]]'', and ''[[Indigofera]]'', which are typical of lowland rainforest.&lt;ref&gt;Ingicco, Thomas, John de Vos, and O.

The '''Keeping All Students Safe Act''' refers to a pair of  [[American (USA)|American]] legislative proposals introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on April 6, 2011 as  [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1381: H.R. 1381] and in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]  on December 16, 2011 as [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2020: S.2020].  The bills are designed to protect children from the abuse of restraint and seclusion in school.  The first Congressional bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on December 9, 2007 and named the Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools Act.&lt;ref name="HR4247"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.4247: HR4247] Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools Act, H.R. 4247, U.S. House of Representatives, Dec. 9, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary sponsors of the two bills are Senator [[Tom Harkin]] (D-IA), Chair of the [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee]], Congressman [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] (D-CA), Ranking Member of the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Education and Workforce Committee]], and Congressman [[Gregg Harper]] (R-MS).

==Background &amp; Legislative History==
Restraint involves immobilizing an individual and preventing him or her from moving his or her arms, legs, body, or head freely.  Seclusion involves the involuntary confinement of an individual in a room or area from which the individual is physically prevented from leaving, whether the room is locked or the door is blocked by furniture.&lt;ref name="S2020"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2020: S.2020] Keeping All Students Safe Act, sec. 2, S.2020, U.S. Senate, Dec. 16, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) undertook a nationwide study of the use of restraint and seclusion in schools and its effects.&lt;ref name="GAO1"&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/assets/130/122526.pdf  U.S. GAO Report] United States Government Accountability Office, “Seclusions and Restraints, Selected Cases of Death and Abuse at Public and Private Schools and Treatment Centers,” May 19, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The GAO found "hundreds of cases of alleged abuse and death related to the use of these methods on schoolchildren during the past two decades."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/senate-oks-bill-limiting-teachers-in-restraint-seclusion-of-students-q93u2gl-137984118.html Journal Sentinel], “Senate OKs Bill Limiting Teachers In Restraint, Seclusion Of Students,” Journal Sentinel, Jan. 24, 2012.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the incidents involved children with [[disabilities]] who are enrolled in [[special education]], the GAO reported.&lt;ref name="GAO1" /&gt;

The GAO documented 20 deaths of children from restraint.  The GAO also reported about restraints that resulted in broken arms, and kindergartners who were tied to chairs with duct tape and who suffered bloody noses.&lt;ref name="GAO1" /&gt;  One teenager hanged himself in a seclusion room, while a teacher sat outside the room.  Before the final episode, he was confined 19 times in a concrete 8 foot by 8 foot room for an average of 94 minutes each time.  His parents were never informed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/news/death-highlights-lack-of-100352.html Atlanta Journal Constitution], Alan Judd, “Death Highlights Lack of Regulation at Psycho-educational Schools,” Atlanta Journal Constitution, July 27, 2009.

Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Disability Rights Network and the Council of Parents Attorneys and Advocates also documented the nationwide use of restraint and seclusion in 2009.&lt;ref name="USN1"&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/education/articles/2009/07/07/students-suffer-abusive-restraint-gao-says U.S. News &amp; World Report] Jessica Calefati, “Students Suffer Abusive Restraint, GAO Says,” U.S. News &amp; World Report, July 7, 2009.

On May 19, 2009, the House Education and Labor Committee held hearings about the use of restraint and seclusion, chaired by Congressman George Miller.&lt;ref name="hearing1"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg49597/pdf/CHRG-111hhrg49597.pdf  U.S. House of Representatives Hearings]  U.S. Congress, Hearing Before the House Committee on Education and Labor, Examining the Abusive and Deadly Use of Seclusion and Restraint in Schools, 111th Congress, May 19, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

One witness testified that her 14-year-old son was killed when restrained by his 230-pound teacher, who smothered him by lying on top of him in a restraint during a disagreement about lunch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-05-19/politics/schools.abuse_1_teacher-testimony-toni-price?_s=PM:POLITICS  CNN Restraints] Congress Hears Accounts Of Abused Special-Needs Students, CNN, May 19, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Another witness testified that her 7-year-old daughter was bruised when she was restrained face down for playing with her tooth, but the parent was never informed by the school.  She also testified that her child was later restrained again, and received a severe abrasion, but she was not informed of the restraint.  She testified that other children were denied access to food, water, and the bathroom while isolated in seclusion confinement rooms.&lt;ref name="hearing1" /&gt;

The GAO presented testimony about its report and findings about restraint and seclusion, and the risk of death and injury.&lt;ref name="hearing1" /&gt;  The GAO also reported that restraint and seclusion have been used to control minor student misbehaviors such as speaking out of turn or refusing to remain in one’s chair.&lt;ref name="USN1" /&gt;  Another hearing witness testified that restraint may be needed in emergencies. He noted that sometimes educators need to use restraint in emergency situations, where there is a risk that a child will injure himself or others and nothing else will work to prevent the immediate danger.  Teachers may use restraint and seclusion appropriately in those circumstances, the witness testified.&lt;ref name="NPR2"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104277070 National Public Radio] Joseph Shapiro, “Report: Discipline Methods Endanger Disabled Kids,” National Public Radio, May 19, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  An Illinois State Board of Education representative presented data from Illinois showing that implementing school-wide positive behavioral supports reduced the use of restraint and seclusion significantly.&lt;ref name="hearing1" /&gt;

The United States House of Representatives reported that children, most often children with disabilities, are subjected to seclusion and restraint at much higher rates than adults, and are at greater risk of injury as a result of these practices. The House further reported that children under the age of 12 are restrained or secluded at higher rates than any other age group.  The House of Representatives also reported that, “the use of restraint and seclusion often exacerbates the behaviors that staff are trying to eliminate.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-111hrpt417/pdf/CRPT-111hrpt417.pdf  House Report 111-417], U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Education &amp; Labor, House Report 111-417, Preventing Harmful Restraint and Seclusion in Schools, Feb. 23, 2010. Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Because there is no federal law, state restraint and seclusion laws control.&lt;ref name="CNNState"&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-05-18/politics/siu.schools.abuse_1_special-needs-students-teacher-gao?_s=PM:POLITICS CNN Report] Abbie Boudreau &amp; Steve Turnham, “GAO report: Special-Needs Kids Abused In Schools,” CNN, May 18, 2009.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2012 report by Jessica Butler for the Autism National Committee summarized state seclusion and restraint laws and policies.  It reported that only 14 states limited the use of restraint to emergencies involving threats of physical injury. Only 11 either banned all forms of seclusion or restricted it to emergency threats of physical harm.  There are 27 states that have no requirement to notify parents when a child is restrained or secluded and only 12 states that require same day or next day notification.&lt;ref name="HowSafe"&gt;[http://www.autcom.org/pdf/HowSafeSchoolhouse.pdf  How Safe Is the Schoolhouse?] Jessica Butler, “How Safe Is The Schoolhouse?

As there is no national clearinghouse that gathers data on the use of the techniques, the exact number of children subjected to restraint and seclusion in school is unknown.&lt;ref name="USN1" /&gt;  The GAO found that only five states kept records.  In two of them, Texas and California, there were over 33,000 cases in 2007-08.  Many of the children had cognitive disabilities, autism, mental health disabilities, attention deficit disorder and other disabilities.&lt;ref name="NPR2" /&gt;  Professor Reece Peterson testified at the House Education and Labor hearing about the need for federal law requiring data collection nationwide.&lt;ref name="hearing1" /&gt;

On December 9, 2009, six months after the House hearing, the first national restraint and seclusion bill was introduced by Congressman George Miller.  It was cosponsored by Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.  A companion bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Chris Dodd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disabilityscoop.com/2009/12/09/restraint-bill-introduced/6448/ Disability Scoop], Michelle Diament, “Lawmakers Unveil Restraint And Seclusion Bill,” Disability Scoop, December 9, 2009.

Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Because passage by both houses of Congress is required for the President to consider a bill in America, both bills died at the end of the 111th Congress in December 2010.

Restraint and seclusion bills were introduced again in the 112th Congress in 2011.  On April 6, 2011, Congressman George Miller (D-CA), Ranking Member of the House Education and Workforce Committee, reintroduced the Keeping All Students Safe Act, cosponsored by Congressman Greg Harper (R-MS).&lt;ref name="HR1381"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1381:  H.R.1381], H.R. 1381, Keeping All Students Safe Act, April 6, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 16, 2011, the second anniversary of Congressman Miller’s first bill, Senator Tom Harkin, Chairman of the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee, introduced a slightly different version of the Keeping All Students Safe Act, S. 2020.&lt;ref name="S2020" /&gt;

==Description of the Keeping All Students Safe Act==
This section of the article focuses on the two newest bills introduced in the 112th Congress in 2011.  The House and Senate versions of the Keeping All Students Safe Act differ.

The House bill prohibits physical restraint except in emergencies when there is an imminent threat of physical injury and less restrictive measures will not resolve the situation.  The Senate bill bars physical restraint unless there is an immediate threat of serious bodily injury and less restrictive measures will not solve the situation.  Both bills would forbid the use of restraint or seclusion for destruction of property, educational disruption, failing to follow instructions, and for coercion, discipline, or in place of proper educational planning.  
 
The House bill also forbids seclusion unless there is an immediate threat of physical injury and less restrictive methods will not resolve the situation.  The House bill will require staff to continuously visually monitor (watch) children who are confined to seclusion rooms to ensure that they are safe.  The Senate bill bans all seclusion of children, which is defined as locking children in rooms or other spaces or blocking the door so they cannot leave (e.g., with furniture).&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.2020: S.2020 sec 4] Keeping All Students Safe Act, sec. 4, S.2020, U.S. Senate, Dec. 16, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1381:  H.R.1381 sec 5], Keeping All Students Safe Act, sec. 5, H.R. 1381, April 6, 2011.  Retrieved March 11, 2012, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Both bills require restraint to end when the emergency ends, and the House bill requires seclusion to end when the emergency ends. Both bills ban the use of mechanical restraints, meaning devices that lock and restrain children, or taping or tying them to chairs or furniture.  Both bills ban chemical restraints and restraints that impair breathing or otherwise threaten life.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"/&gt;

Both bills require schools to notify parents in writing within 24 hours of restraint and verbally the same day.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"/&gt;   There are 27 states that do not have legal requirements for schools to tell parents a child was restrained/secluded.&lt;ref name="HowSafe" /&gt;

Both bills impose training requirements to ensure that staff who use restraint and seclusion are trained in evidence-based techniques and that the techniques are not misused in even more dangerous manners.  Both bills prohibit putting physical restraint as a planned intervention in Individual Education Programs, 504 plans, behavioral intervention plans, student safety plans, or other educational planning documents for individual students.  The bills also require the collection of data nationwide and disaggregating the data by such categories as race, sex, income, and disability status.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="H.R.1381 sec 5"/&gt;

The Senate bill also bans restraints that interfere with the ability to communicate.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;  The GAO reported on at least four cases in which verbal children who died or were injured in restraint told staff that they could not breathe.&lt;ref name="GAO1" /&gt;  Numerous children cannot speak or have difficulty doing so, and rely on sign language or augmentative communications devices.&lt;ref name="HowSafe" /&gt;   Additionally, the Senate bill requires that a debriefing be held, where school staff, the parents, and the student may attend.&lt;ref name="S.2020 sec 4"/&gt;  Debriefings are intended to reduce and eliminate restraint and seclusion, by determining what caused the event and how to avoid it in the future, and by analyzing, planning for, and implementing positive interventions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2001_register&amp;docid=01-1649-filed.pdf  Federal Register], Medicaid Program; Use of Restraint and Seclusion in Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities Providing Psychiatric Services to Individuals Under Age 21; Interim Final Rule, 66 Fed.

==Statement of Congressman Miller on Introduction==

When Congressman Miller re-introduced the House bill in 2011, he described his reasons for doing so, “In 2009, the Government Accountability Office told our committee of the shocking wave of abuse by untrained school staff who were misusing emergency interventions. Most of these victims were children with disabilities. Some were 3 and 4 years old. In some cases, children died. Restraint and seclusion should be used only as a last resort and by trained professionals, but the GAO found that was not the case. . . . A media report out yesterday highlights that these horrific abuses continued through this past year. In Chicago, a 4-year-old boy’s wrists were taped together with painter’s tape and then duct tape because he refused to take a nap and he didn’t wash his hands.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-04-07/pdf/CREC-2011-04-07-pt1-PgH2413-7.pdf#page=1  Congressional Record House], Congressman George Miller, Congressional Record, April 6, 2011. Retrieved  Feb. 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of Senator Harkin on Introduction==
Senator Harkin introduced his bill and explained the reasons for doing so.  He said, “I am pleased to introduce today the Keeping All Students Safe Act. This important legislation will protect school children against ineffective harmful and life threatening seclusion and restraint practices.  . . . Restraint and seclusion-related fatalities and injuries most often involve children with disabilities. This vulnerable population must especially be protected from this type of abuse, and this legislation seeks to do just that.  . . .The act does allow for the use of restraint in emergency situations to prevent serious bodily injury to the student, other students in the classroom, or staff, it also requires State-approved crisis intervention training program as to how to approach these types of emergency situations.”&lt;ref name="CRHarkin"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-12-16/pdf/CREC-2011-12-16-pt1-PgS8735.pdf  Congressional Record Senate], Senator Tom Harkin, Congressional Record, Dec. 16, 2011. Retrieved  Feb. 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator Harkin also addressed data issues, “Another issue uncovered by the GAO study was that no web site, Federal agency, or other entity currently collects comprehensive data related to the use of restraint and seclusion in our Nation's schools. This Act will remedy this situation, as it requires each State educational agency to prepare and submit a report documenting” the use of restraint and seclusion.”&lt;ref name="CRHarkin" /&gt;

==Related Events==
In March 2012, the Office of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education presented a report about its Civil Rights Data Collection.  It reported that students with disabilities made up  represent 12% of students in its data collection sample, but nearly 70% of the students who are physically restrained by adults in school.  For those schools which reported data, there was a total of 38, 792 incidents of physical restraint.  CRDC also found racial and ethnic disproportionality in restraint and seclusion use.  African-American students were 21% of students with disabilities under served under the IDEA, but 44% of students with disabilities subjected to mechanical restraint.  Hispanic children were disproportionately subjected to seclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2012-data-summary.pdf  CRDC Data Collection] Dept. of Education, Office of Civil Rights, Civil Rights Data Collection, Revealing New Truths About Our Nation’s Schools, March 2012.

The '''language tax''' is an [[economics|economic]] concept proposed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] economist [[Philippe Van Parijs]].&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Van Parijs, [http://www1.law.nyu.edu/clppt/program2003/readings/vanparijs.pdf Europe's three language problems], in: Multilingualism in Law and Politics {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511222928/http://www1.law.nyu.edu/clppt/program2003/readings/vanparijs.pdf |date=May 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to compensate countries with a less widespread language for their expenses for teaching and translation.

Van Parijs points out that [[Jonathan Pool]] had proposed this kind of taxation in 1991 but criticizes Pool's proposal to distribute the cost of language learning on a [[per capita]] basis.

An analogous concept is found in the work of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] economist [[François Grin]],&lt;ref&gt;François Grin, [http://cisad.adc.education.fr/hcee/documents/rapport_Grin.pdf L'enseignement des langues étrangères comme politique publique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010075147/http://cisad.adc.education.fr/hcee/documents/rapport_Grin.pdf |date=2006-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who argues that such countries are implicitly paying an ''impôt linguistique'' (literally also meaning "language tax") to countries with a "strong" language. In a similar sense, the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Partito Radicale|Radical Party]] speaks of a ''tassa inglese''&lt;ref&gt;[http://coranet.radicalparty.org/pressreleases/press_release.php?func=detail&amp;par=7817 I costi della tassa "inglese"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310194941/http://coranet.radicalparty.org/pressreleases/press_release.php?func=detail&amp;par=7817 |date=2007-03-10 }}, press release 2005/21/10&lt;/ref&gt; ("English tax").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4023">A '''line of flight''' ({{lang-fr|ligne de fuite}}) is a concept developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and used extensively in his work with [[Félix Guattari]]. Translator [[Brian Massumi]] notes that in French, "''Fuite'' covers not only the act of fleeing or eluding but also flowing, leaking, and disappearing into the distance (the [[vanishing point]] in a painting is a ''point de fuite'').  It has no relation to flying."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Massumi, "Notes on the Translation and Acknowledgments" to Deleuze and Guattari (1980, xvi)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first chapter of the second volume of their ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'' project, ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980), the concept is used to define a "[[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizome]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Multiplicity (philosophy)|Multiplicities]] are defined by the outside: by the abstract line, the line of flight or [[deterritorialization]] according to which they change in nature and connect with other multiplicities. The plane of consistency (grid) is the outside of all multiplicities. The line of flight marks: the reality of a finite number of dimensions that the multiplicity effectively fills; the impossibility of a supplementary dimension, unless the multiplicity is transformed by the line of flight; the possibility and necessity of flattening all of the multiplicities on a single plane of consistency or exteriority, regardless of their number of dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze and Guattari (1980, 9-10).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Manuel De Landa]]'s book ''[[Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy]]'', the line of flight is described as an operator which transcends the actual and ascends to the virtual. It is used as a synonym with Deleuze's terms "dark precursor" (from his ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968)), "[[desiring machine]]" and "quasi-cause" (both from the first volume of ''Capitalism and Schizophrenia'', ''[[Anti-Œdipus]]'' (1972)).

'''[[Linguistic rights]] in [[Europe]]''' are stated in '''[[constitution]]s''' which differ by country. These constitutions usually state the [[national language]] or [[official language]], and may or may not explicitly allow for other languages in the country. Most of the linguistic rights stated here are negative rights, which grant freedom of usage of own language and prevents discrimination based on language. Some countries do offer positive rights: for example provision of language education from State funds in Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Hungary, Moldova, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, and Ukraine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22277">'''Modular art''' is art created by joining together standardized units ([[Modular design|module]]s) to form larger, more complex compositions. In some works the units can be subsequently moved, removed and added to – that is, ''modulated'' – to create a new work of art, different from the original or ensuing configurations.

== Origins ==
Historically, alterable objects of art have existed since the [[Renaissance]], for example, in the [[Triptych]] "[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]" by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] or in the so-called "alterable [[altarpiece]]s", such as the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] by [[Matthias Grünewald]], or [[Albrecht Dürer|Albrecht Dürer's]] [[Paumgartner altarpiece]], where changing motifs could be revised in accord with the changing themes of the ecclesiastical calendar.

== 20th century ==
Beginning in the first half of the 20th century, a number of contemporary artists sought to incorporate [[kinetic art|kinetic techniques]] into their work in an attempt to overcome what they saw as the predominantly static nature of art. [[Alexander Calder|Alexander Calder's]] mobiles are among the most widely known demonstrations of physical dynamism in the visual arts, in which form has the potential to continually vary through perpetual motion, sometimes even without the agency of the human hand. [[Jean Tinguely|Jean Tinguely's]] efforts to create a self-destructive art machine constitute perhaps the ultimate expression of art's mutability, in this case by taking the form of its total eradication. [[Victor Vasarely]] postulated in his ''Manifest Jaune'' in 1955 in Paris that works of art should feature the properties of being multiplicable and repeatable in series. More recently, the notion that visual art need not be conceived solely in terms of perpetually fixed objects is embodied in performance and installation art by virtue of their unfolding and temporary qualities.&lt;ref&gt;See "Modularity in the arts" in [[Modularity]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Industrial design and architecture ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Image:Pfarrkirche Liesing - Erwin Hauer Design 3.JPG|thumb|alt=An architectural screen by Erwin Hauer.|An architectural screen by Erwin Hauer.]][[Modularity]] enters the modern artistic repertory largely through the disciplines of industrial design and architecture. Belgian architect [[Louis Herman De Koninck]] led a team of countrymen in creating one of the first modular product systems in their Cubex kitchen series of 1932. The series consisted of standardized and industrially produced components that could be combined and arrayed in limitless combinations to accommodate almost any size kitchen. New York designer [[Gilbert Rohde]] crafted several lines of modular casework for the [[Herman Miller (office equipment)|Herman Miller Corporation]] in the 1930s and 40s; like De Koninck, Rohde standardized the units in dimensions, materials and configurations to facilitate mass production and interchangeability. His Executive Office Group (EOG) line, launched in 1942, was a similarly ground-breaking systems approach to office furniture. Just a year before [[Eero Saarinen]] and [[Charles Eames]] had jointly produced a suite of modular domestic furniture for the Red Lion Company, a result of a competition held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1950 Herman Miller brought out the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100526040623/http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Eames-Desk-and-Storage-Units EAS Storage Unit series] by Charles and Ray Eames, a very successful modular shelving and wall unit system that remains in production today.

The module enjoys a long history in the realm of architecture. In antiquity architects utilized the module primarily as a unit of measurement guiding the proportions of plan and elevation. The Roman author and architect Vitruvius deployed the modular method in his descriptions of the classical orders and the composition of buildings in his treatise ''Ten Books on Architecture'', the only complete text on architecture to survive from antiquity. Architects of the Renaissance perpetuated the Vitruvian system in their resurrection of the classical orders, a tradition which continues to the present day. Among modern architects, the module is frequently employed as a design and planning tool.

=== Modular constructivism ===
{{main|Modular Constructivism}}
Architecture and modular sculpture intersected starting in the 1950s in the work of [[Norman Carlberg]], [[Erwin Hauer]] and Malcolm Leland. All three received commissions to design perforated architectural screens built out of repetitive modular motives cast in concrete. Non-structural, the screens were used on building exteriors to divide space, filter light and create visual interest. Their work has come to be described as [[Modular Constructivism]], reflecting both its compositional methodology and its architectural context. Each created stand-alone modular-themed sculptures into the 1960s and after as well.

=== Modularity in the fine arts===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Robert Rauschenberg]]'s [https://www.flickr.com/photos/ondahalfoster/2546134482/ "White Painting"] of 1951; consisting of just four equal white squares, with its geometry of interlocking forms, is among the earliest statements of modularity as an autonomous subject of art. Rauschenberg explored this theme that same year in a three- and seven-panel format; the linear array of rectangular panels in these versions suggests their potentially infinite replication.  The cool abstraction of these canvases presages the emergence of modularity as a full-fledged topic of [[Minimalist art]] in the 1960s. [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Dan Flavin]] and [[Donald Judd]] are among this school's most prolific exponents during the period. In particular, the work of Smith is key to understanding the transformation of modularity from a compositional and production tool into a broadly investigated artistic theme in its own right.

[[Image:Minneapolis14.jpg|thumb|alt=Tony Smith, sculpture. Minneapolis, Minnesota.|Tony Smith, sculpture. Minneapolis, MN.]]Smith began his career as an architectural designer. To further his education he apprenticed himself on some projects by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] for a couple of years starting in 1938. From Wright he learned to utilize modular systems in generating architectural designs in two-dimensional plans as well as in three-dimensional applications, such as the development of building sections and interior built-ins. As an architect, Wright himself was part of a centuries-old continuum stretching back through [[Vitruvius]] to Greco-Roman antiquity in which the module was utilized to proportion built and sculpted form. In the case of Wright, the interest in modular design also may have derived from his familiarity with [[tatami|modular practice in traditional Japanese architecture]].

Wright's Hanna House of 1937 is a clear example of the master's facility with modern modular design in multiple dimensions. Its striking angled forms are built up from the individual hexagonal modules that define the floor plan and various vertical elements. Wright's use of the hexagon here is by no means an arbitrary aesthetic choice, but an example of how he rooted his architecture in nature by drawing from its forms and principles – the interlocking hexagonal cells of the bee's honeycomb being nature's most perfect representation of modular design. Not surprisingly, this project is sometimes  referred to as the "Honeycomb House".

Smith would employ the hexagon and other elemental geometries in his own architectural practice and again in the sculpture he began to fabricate in the early 1960s. Freed from the programmatic and extensive structural requirements of his architectural work, Smith's sculptures are three-dimensional extrusions of modular form with no ostensible pragmatic purpose beyond aesthetic contemplation.

Significantly, Smith himself did not manually fabricate the final version of his sculptures. Instead, he outsourced their production to skilled ironworkers in foundries and industrial facilities, who worked off his drawings and models to manufacture the designs. In part this reflects Smith's training as an architect, who customarily designs and documents but does not construct his art. It further reinforces the idea of modular art as a [[generative art|generative system]] in which the arrangement of pre-determined formal units – rather than wholesale imaginative invention – defines the creative act. Finally, it is consistent with the notion implicit in modularity that the supply of modules in a modular system must be infinite, that is, that they be industrially rather than artisanally produced, for the system to be realized. (Bees in a honeycomb are essentially operating as an industrial enterprise insofar as the production of cells is without end.)

The work of Smith and the minimalist school constitute the most far-ranging exploration of modularity in art before the millennium. However, neither it nor the explorations of movable and alterable art in the preceding centuries synthesized the two central features of modular art. Mobiles and other kinetic pieces were not modular, and the modular work of the mid-century Minimalist artists was, with a few exceptions, not changeable.

== Theory in the 21st century ==
[[Image:The Couple 1.JPG|thumb|alt=The Impossibility to Make it|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple.]][[Image:The Couple 2.JPG|thumb|alt=The Possibility to Make it|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple, modulation 1.]][[Image:The Couple 3.JPG|thumb|alt=A Never-ending Story|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple, modulation 2.]][[Image:The Couple 4.JPG|thumb|alt=Inside-out and Upside-down|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple, modulation 3.]][[Image:The Couple 5.JPG|thumb|alt=No Way to Return|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple, modulation 4.]]

=== Co-creativity ===
A school of thought coming out of the United States emphasizes modular art's alignment with the [[post-industrial]] character of 21st century culture and its contrast with traditional notions of art.&lt;ref&gt;[Rattner, Donald]. "A Comparison of Conventional and Modular Art" in ''[http://issuu.com/art-rethought/docs/art_catalogue?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed A.R.T. Catalogue v2.0]''. New York: lulu.com, 2010. Pp. C-1ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Core characteristics of post-industrialism, as largely defined by the theorist [[Daniel Bell]] in his 1973 book ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'', include the emergence of a service economy in place of a manufacturing one; the social and economic pre-eminence of the creative, professional and technical classes; the central place of theoretical knowledge as a font of innovation; the strong influence of technology on daily life; and high levels of urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Daniel. ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society''. New York: Harper Colophon Books, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modular art appears to synchronize perfectly with several of these criteria. For example, its manual changeability opens up the possibility of co-creative art, in which the collector or user collaborates with the originating modular artist to jointly determine the appearance of the work of art. This presupposes the existence of creative people capable of and interested in serving such a role – a demographic evolution that was already underway in Bell's time and that has since been studied in works like Richard Florida's ''Rise of the Creative Class'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Florida, Richard. ''The Rise of the Creative Class and How It's Transforming Work, Leisure and Everyday Life''. Basic Books, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Co-creation]] is closely associated with [[mass customization]], a production model that combines the opportunity for individual personalization with mass production. Modular art and mass customization share a commonality in their synthesis of two opposing qualities. On the one hand, as previously stated the very concept of modularity implies a limitless supply of identical modules such as only industrial production can provide; on the other hand, the ability of the individual to re-arrange these modules in the work of art based on aesthetic criteria re-injects a subjective and purely human dimension into the creative act.

Mass customization is itself only made possible with the advent of computers and a type of software known as a [[configurator]]. A configurator is a software tool used by the buyer to configure a product from the options made available by the vendor. Applied to the purpose of composing a work of modular art onscreen, it can greatly facilitate the design of a modular assembly by allowing the user to study multiple design options more quickly and in far greater depth than by using analog methods. Once the design is established a computer file is then sent over the air to a manufacturing facility where robotically controlled equipment produces the object according to its specifications. Not only does this computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) allow for the customization of mass-produced objects, it also enables a much higher level of precision and fit – qualities critical for modules to be physically joined together. Bell's identification of technology as a central axis of post-industrial life is underscored in the intertwining of the digital with the physical realization of modular art.

=== The de- and re-constructive approach in Europe ===
In Europe, where the 1960s Minimalist school of modular art was often seen as a principally American phenomenon, the discussion of modularity often focuses on its changeability. For example, the mutability of art is a core principle of [[Arte Povera]], a contemporaneous movement that emerged in Italy which holds that works of art "should not be seen as fixed entities", but as objects of change and movement to "include time and space in a new manner. At stake is the issue of transferring the phenomenology of human experience" into the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monopol-magazin.com/magazine/2009/09/interview-carolyn-christov-bakargiev Interview with Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev.] See also: Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn. ''Arte Povera (Themes &amp; Movements)''. New York: Phaidon Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the artist [[Leda Luss Luyken]] has produced modular paintings, composed of movable painted panels set in steel frames. Luss Luyken has dubbed her work "ModulArt".&lt;ref&gt;The term "ModulArt" was first mentioned in 1975 in a German arts encyclopedia as "a form of art […] made by movable elements that […] transfer the object into a new state of being by moving their variable parts" in: Ludewig, Werner (Ed.). ''Kunst – Literatur – Musik, Daten und Fakten''. Lexikon-Institut Bertelsmann, 1975, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, changing the configuration of a modular painting constitutes a form of motion, offering the spectator alternative views and alternative interpretations, and thus aligning the work more closely than a static object to the dynamism of physical human experience.&lt;ref&gt;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/ModulArt&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian and theorist [[Denys Zacharopoulos]] called this "a new way of motion in painting".&lt;ref&gt;von Kap-herr, Georg (Ed.). ''ModulArt''. Bobingen (Germany), 2008, pp. 6-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of modular art allows the user to de-compose and to re-compose a work of art that is already completed by re-arranging its parts, thus providing numerous possibilities for ever newer pictures not yet imagined. The original painting can be re-contextualized ad libitum and ad infinitum.

== Modular artists and their work ==

===Visual artists===
Working in the 1950-60s in Manchester (UK), American artist [[Mitzi Cunliffe]] developed sculptures consisting of multiple blocks about twelve inches square which she put together in a variety of combinations to give a sculptured effect on a large scale. She referred to them as ''modular sculptures''. The University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) acquired some of these works, although there are no references to them in published accounts of her work.&lt;ref&gt;Letter dated 19 December 08 by Prof. E.G. Wedell, Manchester (UK), friend and landlord of Mitzi Cunliffe in Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculptor and ceramicist Malcolm Leland designed in 1954 a similar [http://www.mocad.org/store/Vessel_LS_Fountain.html modular sculpture system] based on a single 23-inch tall module that could be stacked vertically by means of a centering pin; the module has a generally biomorphic, curvilinear outline that yields an undulating silhouette when multiple modules are placed on top of each other. The technique of stacking repetitive elements in the round recalls [[Endless Column|Brancusi's "Endless Column"]] of 1938.

Starting in the 1970s, Leland's contemporary Norman Carlberg produced groups of [http://www.francisfrost.com/carlbergprint.html square framed prints] which he placed together on a wall in a tight grid, each print conceived as an independent module. The viewer is then invited to rotate or reposition them to generate new composite images. The abstract quality of the prints enhanced the creative possibilities of their re-orientation insofar as they are non-directional and geometrically inter-related.

Greek-born [[conceptual artist]] [[Leda Luss Luyken]], who was initially trained as an architect, has been exploring [[modularity]] in the medium of painting since the 1990s. In her work standardized canvas panels are mounted as modules onto a steel frame within which they can be moved and rotated.

In the U.S. Moshé Elimelech creates what he has called [https://web.archive.org/web/20100107101439/http://www.mosheart.com/cubes/index.html "Cubic Constructions"]. These are multiple groupings of approximately three-inch cubes set inside pockets in a framed shadow box. On each cube he applies paint in fields of bright color and abstract pattern with precise, controlled brush strokes. Like Carlsberg, Elimelech then invites the viewer to reposition any or all of the cubes to display one of their six sides, each of which is painted in a different pattern. Exhibiting since the 1980s, Elimelech shows primarily in California galleries, and has work represented in several museum design stores as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mosheart.com/bio/index.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030807164738/http://www.mosheart.com/bio/index.html# |archive-date=2003-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another portfolio of interactive modular art comes out of [http://www.s4aa.com Studio for A.R.T. and Architecture], a New York-based firm headed by Donald Rattner. Rattner has designed modular art in the media of wall sculpture, rotational paintings, tapestries, artist's wallpapers and artist's books. To bring his work and those of other "modulartists" to the marketplace, Rattner founded [http://www.art-rethought.com A.R.T. (art-rethought)], an art storefront focused on co-creative and modular work. In his writings Rattner has emphasized the post-industrial aspect of the most recent trends in modular art, coining the term "New Industrialism" to denote mass customization, production on demand, open innovation, co-creative design, tele-fabrication, robotics and other computer-driven technologies that are re-defining how things are made in the global marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/the_studio_portfolio/docs/studio_portfolio_-_art?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed&amp;layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&amp;showFlipBtn=true. Pp. A-3f.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composers===
Modularity in music can be seen as bringing two key elements of musical composition and film into the world of painting:{{Clarify|date=August 2018}}&lt;!--Painting? What has this to do with music?--&gt; [[Variation (music)|variation]] of a theme and [[Moving image|movement]] of and within a picture. For this very reason the contemporary composer Minas Borboudakis has dedicated the third part of his trilogy ROAI III for piano and electronics to the modular methodology.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Italian composer and arts theoretician [[Stefano Vagnini]] has developed a theory of [[Open source|open-source composition]] based on modular aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;Vagnini, Stafano, ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, 161 pp, Rome: Falcon Valley Music, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a musical work of art being something closed, limited and immobile disappears in favor of a process of numerous aggregations that allow a composition to become infinite in principle. Several such compositions were performed in Europe, South America, Asia and in North America and discussed through conferences in Europe. The approach is being academically discussed at the [[University of West Georgia]] and the Carrollton Cultural Arts Centre in the USA. Writer, painter, and art theorist Gian Ruggero Manzoni described the modularity of Vagnini's compositions  as “circular like the existence, his works are not finished, but merely stimulus for new voices”. &lt;ref&gt;Gian Ruggero Manzoni, in: Vagnini, Stefano:'' SalmodieSubliminali'', Campanotto Editions, Udine, 2007, pp 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''organigraph''' is a graphical representation of a company's structure or processes. It is used as an alternative to a traditional [[organizational chart]] as it does not imply the same degree of linear hierarchy that an organizational chart does.

Organigraphs are used to expose critical associations and competitive opportunities as opposed to viewing all parties, departments, and business units as separate entities. They also can reveal relationships between departments, products, supply chains, and more within an organization that might not otherwise be apparent. Business strategists, consultants, and academics use organigraphs.

The organigraph was conceived by [[Henry Mintzberg]] and [[Ludo Van der Heyden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/898.html|title=Organigraphs: Drawing How Companies Really Work|date=2000-04-01|publisher=Harvard Business School|accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organigraphs can be created as diagrams or as images which represent the nature of the firm. For example, a computer company's organigraph could be in the form of a computer. The hard drive could represent employees, the power supply could relate to its financing, and the web browser could indicate the firm's strategy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8121">'''Plane of immanence''' ({{lang-fr|plan d'immanence}}) is a founding concept in the [[metaphysics]] or [[ontology]] of French philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]]. [[Immanence]], meaning "existing or remaining within" generally offers a relative opposition to [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], that which is beyond or outside. Deleuze rejects the idea that life and creation are opposed to death and non-creation. He instead conceives of a plane of immanence that already includes life and death. "Deleuze refuses to see deviations, redundancies, destructions, cruelties or contingency as accidents that befall or lie outside life; life and death were aspects of desire or the plane of immanence."&lt;ref&gt;C. Colebrook, ''Deleuze: A Guide for the Perplexed'', 2006, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This plane is a '''pure immanence'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, an unqualified immersion or embeddedness, an immanence which denies transcendence as a ''real distinction'', Cartesian or otherwise. Pure immanence is thus often referred to as a pure plane, an infinite field or smooth space without substantial or constitutive division. In his final essay entitled ''Immanence: A Life'', Deleuze writes: "It is only when immanence is no longer immanence to anything other than itself that we can speak of a plane of immanence."&lt;ref name="Deleuze, Pure Immanence, p.27"&gt;Deleuze, ''Pure Immanence'', p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immanence as a pure plane ==

The plane of immanence is metaphysically consistent with [[Spinoza]]’s single substance (God or Nature) in the sense that immanence is not immanent ''to'' substance but rather that immanence ''is'' substance, that is, immanent to itself. Pure immanence therefore will have consequences not only for the validity of a philosophical reliance on transcendence, but simultaneously for [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[idealism]]. Mind may no longer be conceived as a self-contained field, substantially differentiated from body (dualism), nor as the primary condition of unilateral subjective mediation of external objects or events (idealism). Thus all ''real distinctions'' (mind and body, God and matter, interiority and exteriority, etc.) are collapsed or flattened into an even consistency or plane, namely immanence itself, that is, immanence without opposition.

The plane of immanence thus is often called a plane of consistency accordingly. As a geometric plane, it is in no way bound to a mental design but rather an abstract or virtual design; which for Deleuze, is the metaphysical or ontological itself: a formless, univocal, self-organizing process which always qualitatively differentiates from itself. So in ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (with [[Félix Guattari]]), a plane of immanence will eliminate problems of preeminent forms, transcendental subjects, original genesis and real structures: "Here, there are no longer any forms or developments of forms; nor are there subjects or the formation of subjects. There is no structure, any more than there is genesis."&lt;ref name="Deleuze p.266"&gt;Deleuze; Guattari, ''A Thousand Plateaus'', p.266&lt;/ref&gt;  In this sense, [[Hegel]]’s Spirit (Geist) which experiences a self-alienation and eventual reconciliation with itself via its own linear [[dialectic]] through a material history becomes irreconcilable with pure immanence as it depends precisely on a pre-established form or order, namely Spirit itself. Rather on the plane of immanence there are only complex networks of forces, particles, connections, relations, affects and becomings: "There are only relations of movement and rest, speed and slowness between unformed elements, or at least between elements that are relatively unformed, molecules, and particles of all kinds. There are only [[haecceity|haecceities]], affects, subjectless individuations that  constitute collective assemblages. [...] We call this plane, which knows only longitudes and latitudes, speeds and haecceities, the plane of consistency or composition (as opposed to a plan(e) of organization or development)."&lt;ref name="Deleuze p.266"/&gt;

The plane of immanence necessitates an immanent philosophy. Concepts and representations may no longer be considered vacuous forms awaiting content (concept of x, representation of y) but become active productions in themselves, constantly affecting and being affected by other concepts, representations, images, bodies etc. In their final work together, ''What is Philosophy?'', Deleuze and Guattari state that the plane of immanence constitutes "the absolute ground of philosophy, its earth or [[deterritorialization]], the foundation on which it creates its concepts."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze; Guattari, ''What is Philosophy?'', p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pure immanence as lived philosophy ==

The concept of the plane itself is significant as it implies that immanence cannot simply be conceived as the ''within'', but also as the ''upon'', as well as the ''of''. A lobster is not simply within a larger system, but folds from that very same system, functioning and operating consistently upon it, with it and through it, immanently mapping its environment, discovering its own dynamic powers and kinetic relations, as well as the relative limits of those powers and relations. Thus, without a theoretical reliance on transcendent principles, categories or real divisions producing relative breaks or screens of atomistic enclosure, the concept of the plane of immanence may replace nicely any benefits of a philosophical transcendentalism: "Absolute immanence is in itself: it is not in something, ''to'' something; it does not depend on an object or belong to a subject. [...] When the subject or the object falling outside the plane of immanence is taken as a universal subject or as any object to which immanence is attributed, [...] immanence is distorted, for it then finds itself enclosed in the transcendent."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, ''Pure Immanence'', pp.26-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Deleuze offers that pure immanence and life will suppose one another unconditionally: "We will say of pure immanence that it is A LIFE, and nothing else. [...] A life is the immanence of immanence, absolute immanence: it is complete power, complete bliss."&lt;ref name="Deleuze, Pure Immanence, p.27"/&gt;  This is not some abstract, mystical notion of life but ''a'' life, a specific yet impersonal, indefinite life discovered in the real singularity of events and virtuality of moments. ''A'' life is subjectless, neutral, and preceding all individuation and stratification, is present in all things, and thus always immanent to itself. "''A'' life is everywhere [...]: an immanent life carrying with it the events and singularities that are merely actualized in subjects and objects."&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, ''Pure Immanence'', p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

An ethics of immanence will disavow its reference to judgments of good and evil, right and wrong, as according to a transcendent model, rule or law. Rather the diversity of living things and particularity of events will demand the concrete methods of [[immanent evaluation]] (ethics) and immanent experimentation (creativity). These twin concepts will become the basis of a lived Deleuzian ethic.

'''Pure thought''' is an English translation of an expression originally attributed to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Hegel]]. Their usage of the German counterpart revolved around the question of whether pure thought could exist without an object or some material. &lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=-IMXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=%22pure+thought%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA202,M1 Mind: A Quarterly Review of Psychology and Philosophy], : Vol. 105, issue 417 (Jan. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=CdYLAAAAIAAJ Treatise on Logic] (1895) &lt;/ref&gt; Today, more popular uses exist.  That "Pure Thought" could existent and is part of the evidentiary change. The usage here is that pure thought is simply a process, another term for [[thought experiment]].   &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14619764.300-the-thought-that-counts.html The Thought that Counts], [[Paul Davies]], [[New Scientist]], 6 May 1995 &lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cryptography]], '''rubber-hose cryptanalysis''' is a [[euphemism]] for the extraction of cryptographic secrets (e.g. the password to an encrypted file) from a person by [[coercion]] or [[torture]]&lt;ref name=CNET_20081024&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13739_3-10069776-46.html |title=Turkish police may have beaten encryption key out of TJ Maxx suspect |date=October 24, 2008 |first=Chris |last=Soghoian |authorlink=Christopher Soghoian |work=Surveillance State |publisher=[[CNET Networks]] |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/10/rubber_hose_cry.html |title=Rubber-Hose Cryptanalysis |first=Bruce |last=Schneier |authorlink=Bruce Schneier |date=October 27, 2008 |work=Schneier on Security |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;—such as beating that person with a rubber [[hose]], hence the name—in contrast to a mathematical or technical [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic attack]].

== Details ==

According to [[Amnesty International]] and the [[United Nations|UN]], many countries in the world routinely torture people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(03)14730-7/fulltext |title=Exposing the horror of torture |first=Stephen |last=Pincock |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=362 |issue=9394 |pages =1462–1463 |date=November 1, 2003 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14730-7 |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |pmid=14603923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_2004_10_27"&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=12364&amp;Cr=torture |title=Many countries still appear willing to use torture, warns UN human rights official |publisher=[[United Nations|UN]] News Service |date=October 27, 2004 |accessdate=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(00)03218-9/fulltext |title=Torture and trauma in post-conflict East Timor |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=356 |issue=9243 |page=1763 |date=November 18, 2000 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)03218-9 |first1=J. |last1=Modvig |first2=J. |last2=Pagaduan-Lopez |first3=J. |last3=Rodenburg |first4=CMD |last4=Salud |first5=RV |last5=Cabigon |first6=CIA |last6=Panelo |archiveurl=http://members.pcug.org.au/~wildwood/Lancet.htm |archivedate=August 27, 2005 |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |pmid=11095275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)65892-8/fulltext |title=Turkish physicians coerced to conceal systematic torture | authorlink = Vincent Iacopino | first=Vincent |last=Iacopino |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=348 |issue=9040 |page=1500 |date=November 30, 1996 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)65892-8 |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |pmid=11654536}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore logical to assume that at least some of those countries use (or would be willing to use) some form of rubber-hose cryptanalysis.&lt;ref name=CNET_20081024/&gt; In practice, [[Coercion#Psychological|psychological coercion]] can prove as effective as physical [[torture]]. Not physically violent but highly intimidating methods include such tactics as the threat of harsh legal penalties. The incentive to cooperate may be some form of [[plea bargain]], such as an offer to drop or reduce criminal charges against a suspect in return for full co-operation with investigators. Alternatively, in some countries threats may be made to prosecute as co-conspirators (or inflict violence upon) close relatives (e.g. spouse, children, or parents) of the person being questioned unless they co-operate.&lt;ref name="UN_2004_10_27"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animatedsoftware.com/hightech/philspgp.htm |title=Interview with author of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) |date=February 2, 1996 |first=Russell D. |last=Hoffman |work=High Tech Today |accessdate=August 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some contexts, rubber-hose cryptanalysis may not be a viable attack because of a need to decrypt data covertly; information such as a password may lose its value if it is known to have been compromised.  It has been argued that one of the purposes of strong cryptography is to force adversaries to resort to less covert attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bsdcan.org/2010/schedule/attachments/135_crypto1hr.pdf |title=Everything you need to know about cryptography in 1 hour (conference slides) |date=May 13, 2010 |first=Colin |last=Percival |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known use of the term was on the [[sci.crypt]] newsgroup,{{Citation needed|reason=No evidence cited that this use was the first known use of the term|date=February 2014}} in a message posted 16 October 1990 by [[Marcus J. Ranum]], alluding to [[foot whipping|corporal punishment]]:

{{quote|...the rubber-hose technique of cryptanalysis. (in which a rubber hose is applied forcefully and frequently to the soles of the feet until the key to the cryptosystem is discovered, a process that can take a surprisingly short time and is quite computationally inexpensive).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |url=http://groups.google.com/group/sci.crypt/msg/86404637e708d900?pli=1 |title=Re: Cryptography and the Law... |first=Marcus J. |last=Ranum |newsgroup=sci.crypt |message-id=1990Oct16.050000.4965@decuac.dec.com |date=October 16, 1990 |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the term is used [[tongue-in-cheek]], its implications are serious: in modern cryptosystems, the weakest link is often the human user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/vpns/weakest-link-human-factor-lessons-learned-german-wwii-enigma-cryptosystem_738|title=The Weakest Link: The Human Factor Lessons Learned from the German WWII Enigma Cryptosystem|publisher=SANS|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[brute force attack|direct attack]] on a cipher algorithm, or the [[cryptographic protocol]]s used, is likely to be much more expensive and difficult than targeting the people who use or manage the system. Thus, many cryptosystems and security systems are designed with special emphasis on keeping human vulnerability to a minimum. For example, in [[public-key cryptography]], the defender may hold the key to encrypt the message, but not the decryption key needed to decipher it. The problem here is that the defender may be unable to convince the attacker to stop coercion. In plausibly [[deniable encryption]], a second key is created which unlocks a second convincing but relatively harmless message (for example, apparently personal writings expressing "deviant" thoughts or desires of some type that are lawful but taboo), so the defender can prove to have handed over the keys whilst the attacker remains unaware of the primary hidden message. In this case, the designer's expectation is that the attacker will not realize this, and forego threats or actual torture. The risk, however, is that the attacker may be aware of deniable encryption and will assume the defender knows more than one key, meaning the attacker may refuse to stop coercing the defender even if one or more keys are revealed: on the assumption the defender is still withholding additional keys which hold additional information.

== In law ==

In some jurisdictions, statutes assume the opposite—that human operators know (or have access to) such things as session keys, an assumption which parallels that made by rubber-hose practitioners. An example is the United Kingdom's [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000|Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]],&lt;ref name="Guardian Q&amp;As"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/oct/24/qanda | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | title=The RIP Act | date=October 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RIP online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldbills/061/2000061.htm|title=Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill; in Session 1999-2000, Internet Publications, Other Bills before Parliament|publisher=House of Lords|date=9 May 2000|accessdate=5 Jan 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108020103/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldbills/061/2000061.htm|archivedate=8 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes it a crime not to surrender [[Key (cryptography)|encryption keys]] on demand from a government official authorized by the act.

According to the [[Home Office]], the burden of proof that an accused person is in possession of a key rests on the prosecution; moreover, the act contains a defense for operators who have lost or forgotten a key, and they are not liable if they are judged to have done what they can to recover a key.&lt;ref name="Guardian Q&amp;As"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RIP online"/&gt;

==Possible case==
In the lead-up to the [[Kenyan general election, 2017|2017 Kenyan general election]], the head of information, communication, and technology at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, Christopher Msando, [[Kenyan general election, 2017#Msando murder|was murdered]]. He had played a major role in developing the new voting system for the election. His body showed apparent marks of torture, and there were concerns that the murderers had tried to get password information out of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=David Pilling|title=Ghost of Chris Msando haunts Kenyan election|url=https://www.ft.com/content/1cfa53ae-7e7a-11e7-9108-edda0bcbc928|work=Financial Times|date=Aug 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sake Sommelier of the Year''' is an annual competition jointly organised by the '''[[Sake Sommelier Association]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AFWS seeks out UK Sake Sommelier of the Year|url=http://www.harpers.co.uk/news/afws-seeks-out-uk-sake-sommelier-of-the-year/348161.article|newspaper=Harpers.co.uk|date=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Held in [[London]] it is the first of its kind to be held outside [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In the English county of Sake sommelier training Japanese boom intoxicating world|url=http://sake.newsclipping.net/archives/4330/|newspaper=Tokyo Shimbun|date=4 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109194131/http://sake.newsclipping.net/archives/4330|archivedate=9 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sake popularity surging abroad but markrting needed|url= http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/01/07/national/sake-popularity-surging-abroad-but-marketing-needed-2/#.Us7N89tQ3IU|newspaper=The Japan Times|date=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The competition aims to find the most skilful [[Sake]] [[Sommelier]]s bringing them to the attention of their customers and raising the profile of their establishments. More than 50 sommeliers from [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] entered the first competition in 2013.

In 2015, two new titles were introduced to both encourage and reward contribution to the world of sake; Young Sake Ambassador and Sake Ambassador.

== Judging Process ==
The Sake Sommelier of the Year is open to any professionals involved in the service of sake.

After registering, applicants are sent a first-round questionnaire. From these, three finalist are chosen to compete in the live competition where they will be judged on knowledge, blind tasting, sake matching, and practical skill.

An enormous amount of learning and confidence-building takes place by taking part in the competition.

'''Social cognitive theory''' ('''SCT'''), used in psychology, education, and communication, holds that portions of an individual's knowledge acquisition can be directly related to [[observing]] others within the context of social interactions, experiences, and outside media influences. This theory was advanced by Albert Bandura as an extension of his social learning theory. The theory states that when people observe a model performing a behavior and the consequences of that behavior, they remember the sequence of events and use this information to guide subsequent behaviors.  Observing a model can also prompt the viewer to engage in behavior they already learned.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 1986"&gt;Bandura, A., Social foundations of thought and action : a social cognitive theory. 1986, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 2002 pp. 94-124"&gt;Bandura, A. (2008). Social cognitive theory of mass communication. In J. Bryant &amp; M. B. Oliver (Eds.), Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research (pp. 94-124). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, people do not learn new behaviors solely by trying them and either succeeding or failing, but rather, the survival of humanity is dependent upon the replication of the actions of others. Depending on whether people are rewarded or punished for their behavior and the outcome of the behavior, the observer may choose to replicate behavior modeled. Media provides models for a vast array of people in many different environmental settings.

==History==
The conceptual roots for social cognitive theory come from [[Edwin B. Holt]] and [[Harold Chapman Brown]]'s 1931 book theorizing that all animal action is based on fulfilling the psychological needs of "feeling, emotion, and desire". The most notable component of this theory is that it predicted a person cannot learn to imitate until they are imitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Holt, E.B.|author2=H.C. Brown|lastauthoramp=y|title=Animal drive and the learning process, an essay toward radical empiricism|year=1931|location=New York|publisher=H. Holt and Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Neal E. Miller and John Dollard presented their book with a revision of Holt's social learning and imitation theory.  They argued four factors contribute to learning: drives, cues, responses, and rewards.  One driver is social motivation, which includes imitativeness, the process of matching an act to an appropriate cue of where and when to perform the act.  A behavior is imitated depending on whether the model receives a positive or negative response consequences.&lt;ref name="Miller &amp; Dollard"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miller, N.E.|author2=J. Dollard|author3=R. Yale University|lastauthoramp=y|title=Institute of Human, Social learning and imitation|year=1941|location=New Haven; London|publisher=Pub. for the Institute of human relations by Yale university press; H. Milford, Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller and  Dollard argued that if one were motivated to learn a particular behavior, then that particular behavior would be learned through clear observations. By imitating these observed actions the individual observer would solidify that learned action and would be rewarded with [[positive reinforcement]].

The proposition of social learning was expanded upon and theorized by Canadian psychologist [[Albert Bandura]]. Bandura, along with his students and colleagues conducted a series of studies, known as the [[Bobo doll experiment]], in 1961 and 1963 to find out why and when children display aggressive behaviors. These studies demonstrated the value of modeling for acquiring novel behaviors. These studies helped Bandura publish his seminal article and book in 1977 that expanded on the idea of how behavior is acquired, and thus built from Miller and Dollard's research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Evans, R.I.|author2=A. Bandura|lastauthoramp=y|title=Albert Bandura, the man and his ideas—a dialogue|year=1989|location=New York|publisher=Praeger}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Bandura's 1977 article, he claimed that Social Learning Theory shows a direct correlation between a person's perceived self-efficacy and behavioral change.  Self-efficacy comes from four sources: "performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bandura | first1 = A | year = 1977 | title = Self-efficacy: Toward a Unifying Theory of Behavioral Change  | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 84 | issue = 2| pages = 191–215 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.2.191|pmid= 847061 | url=https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Bandura/Bandura1977PR.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Bandura published his second book, which expanded and renamed his original theory. He called the new theory ''social cognitive theory''.  Bandura changed the name to emphasize the major role cognition plays in encoding and performing behaviors. In this book, Bandura argued that human behavior is caused by personal, behavioral, and environmental influences.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 1986"/&gt;

In 2001, Bandura brought SCT to mass communication in his journal article that stated the theory could be used to analyze how "symbolic communication influences human thought, affect and action".  The theory shows how new behavior diffuses through society by psychosocial factors governing acquisition and adoption of the behavior.&lt;ref name="Bandura"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bandura, A.|title=Social Cognitive Theory of Mass Communication|journal=Media Psychology|year=2001|volume=3|issue=3|p=265–299|url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/crp/Media/Bandura_01.pdf|doi=10.1207/S1532785XMEP0303_03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Bandura published a book chapter -- ''The Social and Policy Impact of Social Cognitive Theory''—to extend SCT'S application in health promotion and urgent [[global issue]]s, which provides insight into addressing global problems through a macro social lens, aiming at improving equality of individuals' lives under the umbrellas of SCT.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 2011 pp. 33-70"&gt;Bandura, A. (2011).  The Social and Policy Impact of Social Cognitive Theory.  In M. Mark, S. Donaldson, &amp; B. Campbell (Eds.), Social Psychology and Evaluation. (pp. 33-70). New York, NY:Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

SCT has been applied to many areas of human functioning such as career choice and organizational behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lent|first=Robert|author2=Steven D. Brown |author3=Gail Hackett |title=Toward a Unifying Social Cognitive Theory of Career and Academic Interest, Choice, and Performance|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|date=August 1994|volume=45|issue=1|pages=79–122|doi=10.1006/jvbe.1994.1027}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as in understanding classroom motivation, learning, and achievement.

==Current status==
Social Cognitive Theory originated in psychology, but based on an unofficial November 2013 Google Scholar search, only 2 percent of articles published on SCT are in the pure psychology field.  About 20 percent of articles are from Education and 16 percent from Business.  The majority of publications using SCT, 56 percent, come from the field of Applied Health Psychology. The majority of current research in Health Psychology focuses on testing SCT in behavioral change campaigns as opposed to expanding on the theory. Campaign topics include: increasing fruit and vegetable intake, increasing physical activity&lt;ref&gt;Freigoun, Mohammad T., César A. Martín, Alicia B. Magann, Daniel E. Rivera, Sayali S. Phatak, Elizabeth V. Korinek, and Eric B. Hekler. "System identification of Just Walk: A behavioral mHealth intervention for promoting physical activity." In American Control Conference (ACC), 2017, pp. 116-121. IEEE, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;, HIV education, and breastfeeding.

Born in 1925, Bandura is still influencing the world with expansions of SCT. His recent work, published May 2011, focuses on how SCT impacts areas of both health and population in relation to climate change.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 2011 pp. 33-70"/&gt; He proposes that these problems could be solved through television serial dramas that show models similar to viewers performing the desired behavior. On health, Bandura writes that currently there is little incentive for doctors to write prescriptions for healthy behavior, but he believes the cost of fixing health problems start to outweigh the benefits of being healthy.  Bandura argues that we are on the cusp of moving from a disease model (focusing on people with problems) to a health model (focusing on people being healthy) and SCT is the theory that should be used to further a healthy society.  Specifically on Population, Bandura states that population growth is a global crisis because of its correlation with depletion and degradation of our planet's resources.  Bandura argues that SCT should be used to increase birth control use, reduce gender inequality through education, and to model environmental conservation to improve the state of the planet.

==Overview==
Social cognitive theory is a learning theory based on the idea that people learn by observing others. These learned behaviors can be central to one's personality. While social psychologists agree that the environment one grows up in contributes to behavior, the individual person (and therefore cognition) is just as important.  People learn by observing others, with the environment, behavior, and cognition acting as primary factors that influence development in a reciprocal triadic relationship. Each behavior witnessed can change a person's way of thinking (cognition). Similarly, the environment one is raised in may influence later behaviors. For example, a caregiver's mindset (also cognition) determines the environment in which their children are raised.

The core concepts of this theory are explained by [[Albert Bandura|Bandura]] through a schematization of triadic reciprocal causation,&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 2002 pp. 94-124"/&gt; The schema shows how the reproduction of an observed behavior is influenced by the interaction of the following three determinants: 
# Personal: Whether the individual has high or low self-efficacy toward the behavior (i.e. Get the learner to believe in his or her personal abilities to correctly complete a behavior). 
# Behavioral: The response an individual receives after they perform a behavior (i.e. Provide chances for the learner to experience successful learning as a result of performing the behavior correctly). 
# Environmental: Aspects of the environment or setting that influence the individual's ability to successfully complete a behavior (i.e. Make environmental conditions conducive for improved self-efficacy by providing appropriate support and materials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-efficacy theory|work=Edutech Wiki|url=http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Self-efficacy_theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that learning can occur without a change in behavior. According to J.E. Ormrod's general principles of social learning, while a visible change in behavior is the most common proof of learning, it is not absolutely necessary. Social learning theorists believe that because people can learn through observation alone, their learning may not necessarily be shown in their performance. These are interdependent on each other and its influence can be directly linked with individual or group psychological behavior. &lt;ref&gt;Stajkovic, A., and Luthans, F. (2003). “Social Cognitive Theory and Self-Efficacy: Implication for Motivation Theory and Practice.” Motivation and Work Behavior, by Lyman W. Porter et al., McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2003, pp. 126–139. &lt;/ref&gt;According to Alex Stajkovic and Fred Luthans it is critically important to recognize that the relative influences exerted by one, two, or three interacting factors on motivated behavior will vary depending on different activities, different individuals and different circumstances.

==Theoretical foundations==

=== Human agency ===

Social cognitive theory is proposed in an agentic perspective, which suggests that, instead of being just shaped by environments or inner forces, individuals are self-developing, self-regulating, self-reflecting and proactive.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 1986" /&gt; Specifically, human agency operates within three modes:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pajares|first1=Frank|last2=Prestin|first2=Abby|last3=Chen|first3=Jason|last4=Nabi|first4=Robin L|title=Social cognitive theory and media effects|journal=The Sage handbook of media processes and effects|date=2009|pages=283–297}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
* Individual Agency: A person’s own influence on the environment;  
* Proxy Agency: Another person’s effort on securing the individual’s interests; 
* Collective Agency: A group of people work together to achieve the common benefits.

Human agency has four core properties:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

* Intentionality: Individuals’ active decision on engaging in certain activities; 
* Forethought: Individuals’ ability to anticipate the outcome of certain actions; 
* Self-reactiveness: Individuals’ ability to construct and regulate appropriate behaviors;
* Self-reflectiveness: Individuals’ ability to reflect and evaluate the soundness of their cognitions and behaviors.

=== Human capability ===

Evolving over time, human beings are featured with advanced neural systems, which enable individuals to acquire knowledge and skills by both direct and symbolic terms.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 2002 pp. 94-124" /&gt; Four primary capabilities are addressed as important foundations of social cognitive theory: symbolizing capability, self-regulation capability, self-reflective capability, and vicarious capability.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 2002 pp. 94-124" /&gt;

# Symbolizing Capability: People are affected not only by direct experience but also indirect events. Instead of merely learning through laborious trial-and-error process, human beings are able to symbolically perceive events conveyed in messages, construct possible solutions, and evaluate the anticipated outcomes.  
# Self-regulation Capability: Individuals can regulate their own intentions and behaviors by themselves. Self-regulation lies on both negative and positive feedback systems, in which discrepancy reduction and discrepancy production are involved. That is, individuals proactively motivate and guide their actions by setting challenging goals and then making effort to fulfill them. In doing so, individuals gain skills, resources, self-efficacy and beyond.
# Self-reflective Capability: Human beings can evaluate their thoughts and actions by themselves, which is identified as another distinct feature of human beings. By verifying the adequacy and soundness of their thoughts through enactive, various, social, or logical manner, individuals can generate new ideas, adjust their thoughts, and take actions accordingly.  
# Vicarious Capability: One critical ability human being featured is to adopt skills and knowledge from information communicated through a wide array of mediums. By vicariously observing others’ actions and its consequences, individuals can gain insights into their own activities. Vicarious capability is of great value to human beings’ cognitive development in nowadays, in which most of our information encountered in our lives derives from the mass media than trial-and-error process.

==Theoretical components==

=== Modeling ===

Social cognitive theory revolves around the process of knowledge acquisition or learning directly correlated to the observation of models. The models can be those of an interpersonal imitation or media sources. Effective modeling teaches general rules and strategies for dealing with different situations.&lt;ref name="Bandura1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bandura, A.|year=1988|url=http://www.agsm.edu.au/eajm/8812/pdf/bandurav13n2.pdf|title=Organizational Application of Social Cognitive Theory|journal=Australian Journal of Management|volume=13|issue=2|pages=275–302|doi=10.1177/031289628801300210|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304022549/http://www.agsm.edu.au/eajm/8812/pdf/bandurav13n2.pdf|archivedate=2011-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate that people learn from watching others, Albert Bandura and his colleagues constructed a series of experiments using a Bobo doll. In the first experiment, children were exposed to either an aggressive or non-aggressive model of either the same sex or opposite sex as the child. There was also a control group. The aggressive models played with the Bobo doll in an aggressive manner, while the non-aggressive models played with other toys.  They found that children who were exposed to the aggressive models performed more aggressive actions toward the Bobo doll afterward, and that boys were more likely to do so than girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|author2=Ross, D. |author3=Ross, S. |title=Transmission of aggression through imitation of aggressive models|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1961|volume=63|pages=575–582|doi=10.1037/h0045925|pmid=13864605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following that study, Albert Bandura tested whether the same was true for models presented through media by constructing an experiment he called ''Bobo Doll Behavior: A Study of Aggression''. In this experiment Bandura exposed a group of children to a video featuring violent and aggressive actions. After the video he then placed the children in a room with a Bobo doll to see how they behaved with it. Through this experiment, Bandura discovered that children who had watched the violent video subjected the dolls to more aggressive and violent behavior, while children not exposed to the video did not. This experiment displays the social cognitive theory because it depicts how people reenact behaviors they see in the media. In this case, the children in this experiment reenacted the model of violence they directly learned from the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|author2=Ross, D. |author3=Ross, S. |title=Imitation of film-mediated aggressive models|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|year=1963|volume=66|pages=3–11|doi=10.1037/h0048687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observations should include: 
* ''Attention'' Observers selectively give attention to specific social behavior depending on accessibility, relevance, complexity, functional value of the behavior or some observer's personal attributes such as cognitive capability, value preference, preconceptions. 
* ''Retention'' Observe a behavior and subsequent consequences, then convert that observation to a symbol that can be accessed for future reenactments of the behavior.  Note: When a ''positive behavior'' is shown a positive reinforcement should follow, this parallel is similar for ''negative behavior''. 
* ''Production'' refers to the symbolic representation of the original behavior being translated into action through reproduction of the observed behavior in seemingly appropriate contexts.  During reproduction of the behavior, a person receives feedback from others and can adjust their representation for future references. 
* ''Motivational process'' reenacts a behavior depending on responses and consequences the observer receives when reenacting that behavior.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 2002 pp. 94-124"/&gt;

Modeling does not limit to only live demonstrations but also verbal and written behaviour can act as indirect forms of modeling. Modeling not only allows students to learn behaviour that they should repeat but also to inhibit certain behaviours. For instance, if a teacher glares at one student who is talking out of turn, other students may suppress this behavior to avoid a similar reaction.  Teachers model both material objectives and underlying curriculum of virtuous living. Teachers should also be dedicated to the building of high [[self-efficacy]] levels in their students by recognizing their accomplishments.

=== Outcome expectancies ===

To learn a particular behavior, people must understand what the potential outcome is if they repeat that behavior. The observer does not expect the actual rewards or punishments incurred by the model, but anticipates similar outcomes when imitating the behavior (called ''[[outcome expectancies]]''), which is why modeling impacts cognition and behavior. These expectancies are heavily influenced by the environment that the observer grows up in; for example, the expected consequences for a [[DUI]] in the United States of America are a fine, with possible jail time, whereas the same charge in another country might lead to the infliction of the death penalty.

For example, in the case of a student, the instructions the teacher provides help students see what outcome a particular behaviour leads to. It is the duty of the teacher to teach a student that when a behaviour is successfully learned, the outcomes are meaningful and valuable to the students.

=== Self-efficacy ===

Social cognitive theory posits that learning most likely occurs if there is a close identification between the observer and the model and if the observer also has a good deal of [[self-efficacy]]. Self–efficacy is the extent to which an individual believes that they can master a particular skill. Self-efficacy beliefs function as an important set of proximal determinants of human motivation, affect, and action—which operate on action through motivational, cognitive, and affective intervening processes.&lt;ref name="Bandura2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bandura, A.|year=1989|title=Human Agency in Social Cognitive Theory|journal=American Psychologist|volume=44|issue=9|pages=1175–1184|pmid=2782727|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.44.9.1175|url=https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Bandura/Bandura1989AP.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bandura, self-efficacy is "the belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bandura, A.|title=Self-efficacy in changing societies|location=Cambridge; New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bandura and other researchers  have found an individual's self-efficacy plays a major role in how goals, tasks, and challenges are approached. Individuals with high self-efficacy are more likely to believe they can master challenging problems and they can recover quickly from setbacks and disappointments. Individuals with low self-efficacy tend to be less confident and don't believe they can perform well, which leads them to avoid challenging tasks.  Therefore, self-efficacy plays a central role in behavior performance. Observers who have high level of self-efficacy are more likely to adopt observational learning behaviors.

Self-efficacy can be developed or increased by: 
* '''Mastery experience''', which is a process that helps an individual achieve simple tasks that lead to more complex objectives. 
* '''Social modeling''' provides an identifiable model that shows the processes that accomplish a behavior. 
* '''Improving physical and emotional states''' refers to ensuring a person is rested and relaxed prior to attempting a new behavior. The less relaxed, the less patient, the more likely they won't attain the goal behavior. 
* '''Verbal persuasion''' is providing encouragement for a person to complete a task or achieve a certain behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=McAlister AL, Perry CL, Parcel GS|chapter=How Individuals, Environments, and Health Behaviors Interact: Social Cognitive Theory|title=Health Behavior and Health Education: Theory, Research, and Practice|edition=4th|location=San Francisco, CA|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc|year=2008|pp=169–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, students become more effortful, active, pay attention, highly motivated and better learners when they perceive that they have mastered a particular task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|title=Perceived Self Efficacy in Cognitive Development and Functioning|journal=Educational Psychologist|year=1993|volume=28|issue=2|pages=117–148|doi=10.1207/s15326985ep2802_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the duty of the teacher to allow student to perceive in their efficacy by providing feedback to understand their level of proficiency. Teachers should ensure that the students have the knowledge and strategies they need to complete the tasks.

[[Self-efficacy]] has also been used to predict behavior in various health related situations such as weight loss, quitting smoking, and recovery from heart attack. In relation to exercise science, [[self-efficacy]] has produced some of the most consistent results revealing an increase in participation in exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Weinberg, Robert S.|author2=Gould, Daniel|title=Foundation of Sport and Exercise Psychology|edition=4th|location=Champaign, IL|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2007|page=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identification ===

Identification allows the observer to feel a one-to-one similarity with the model, and can thus lead to a higher chance of the observer following through with the modeled action.&lt;ref name="Bandura1"/&gt; People are more likely to follow behaviors modeled by someone with whom they can identify with. The more commonalities or emotional attachments perceived between the observer and the model, the more likely the observer learns and reenact the modeled behavior.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==== Media contents studies ====
Social cognitive theory is often applied as a theoretical framework of studies pertained to media representation regarding race, gender, age and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mastro|first1=Dana E|last2=Stern|first2=Susannah R|title=Representations of race in television commercials: A content analysis of prime-time advertising|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|date=2003|volume=47|issue=4|pages=638–647|doi=10.1207/s15506878jobem4704_9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raman|first1=Priya|last2=Harwood|first2=Jake|last3=Weis|first3=Deborah|last4=Anderson|first4=Judith L|last5=Miller|first5=Grace|title=Portrayals of older adults in US and Indian magazine advertisements: A cross-cultural comparison|journal=The Howard Journal of Communications|date=2008|volume=19|issue=3|pages=221–240|doi=10.1080/10646170802218214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aubrey|first1=Jennifer Stevens|title=Sex and punishment: An examination of sexual consequences and the sexual double standard in teen programming|journal=Sex Roles|date=2004|volume=50|issue=7-8|pages=505–514|doi=10.1023/b:sers.0000023070.87195.07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social cognitive theory suggested heavily repeated images presented in mass media can be potentially processed and encoded by the viewers (Bandura, 2011).

==== Media effects studies ====
Social cognitive theory is pervasively employed in studies examining attitude or behavior changes triggered by the mass media. As Bandura suggested, people can learn how to perform behaviors through media modeling.&lt;ref name="Bandura, A. 2002 pp. 94-124" /&gt; SCT has been widely applied in media studies pertained to sports, health, education and beyond. For instance, Hardin and Greer in 2009 examined the gender-typing of sports within the theoretical framework of social cognitive theory, suggesting that sports media consumption and gender-role socialization significantly related with gender perception of sports in American college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardin|first1=Marie|last2=Greer|first2=Jennifer D|title=The influence of gender-role socialization, media use and sports participation on perceptions of gender-appropriate sports|journal=Journal of Sport Behavior|date=2009|volume=32|issue=2|pages=207–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In health communication, social cognitive theory has been applied in research related to smoking quit, HIV prevention, safe sex behaviors, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|title=Social cognitive theory and exercise of control over HIV infection|journal=Preventing AIDS|date=1994|pages=25–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|title=Health promotion by social cognitive means|journal=Health education &amp; behavior|date=2004|volume=31|issue=2|pages=143–164|doi=10.1177/1090198104263660}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Martino, Collins, Kanouse, Elliott, and Berry in 2005 examined the relationship between the exposure to television’s sexual content and adolescents’ sexual behavior through the lens of social cognitive theory, confirming the significant relationship between the two variables among white and African American groups; however, no significant correlation was found between the two variables in the ethic group of Hispanics, indicating that peer norm could possibly serve as a mediator of the two examined variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martino|first1=Steven C|last2=Collins|first2=Rebecca L|last3=Kanouse|first3=David E|last4=Elliott|first4=Marc|last5=Berry|first5=Sandra H|title=Social cognitive processes mediating the relationship between exposure to television's sexual content and adolescents' sexual behavior|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2005|volume=89|issue=6|page=914|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.89.6.914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller's 2005 study found that choosing the proper gender, age, and ethnicity for models ensured the success of an [[AIDS]] campaign to inner city teenagers.  This occurred because participants could identify with a recognizable peer, have a greater sense of self-efficacy, and then imitate the actions to learn the proper preventions and actions.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, Katherine (2005).

A study by Azza Ahmed in 2009 looked to see if there would be an increase in breastfeeding by mothers of preterm infants when exposed to a breastfeeding educational program guided by SCT. Sixty mothers were randomly assigned to either participate in the program or they were given routine care.  The program consisted of SCT strategies that touched on all three SCT determinants: personal – showing models performing breastfeeding correctly to improve self-efficacy, behavioral –weekly check-ins for three months reinforced participants' skills, environmental – mothers were given an observational checklist to make sure they successfully completed the behavior. The author found that mothers exposed to the program showed significant improvement in their breastfeeding skills, were more likely to exclusively breastfeed, and had fewer problems then the mothers who were not exposed to the educational program.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, A.

==Morality==
{{Main|Social cognitive theory of morality}}
Social cognitive theory emphasizes a large difference between an individual's ability to be morally competent and morally performing. [[Moral competence]] involves having the ability to perform a moral behavior, whereas [[moral performance]] indicates actually following one's idea of moral behavior in a specific situation.&lt;ref name="Santrock"&gt;Santrock, J.W. (2008). A Topical Approach to Lifespan Development (M. Ryan, Ed., 4th ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (Original work published 2002), pp. 26, 30, 478&lt;/ref&gt; Moral competencies include:
* what an individual is capable of
* what an individual knows
* what an individual's skills are
* an individual's awareness of moral rules and regulations
* an individual's cognitive ability to construct behaviors

As far as an individual's development is concerned, moral competence is the growth of cognitive-sensory processes; simply put, being aware of what is considered right and wrong. By comparison, moral performance is influenced by the possible rewards and incentives to act a certain way.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt; For example, a person's moral competence might tell them that stealing is wrong and frowned upon by society; however, if the reward for stealing is a substantial sum, their moral performance might indicate a different line of thought. Therein lies the core of social cognitive theory.

For the most part, social cognitive theory remains the same for various cultures. Since the concepts of moral behavior did not vary much between cultures (as crimes like murder, theft, and unwarranted violence are illegal in virtually every society), there is not much room for people to have different views on what is morally right or wrong. The main reason that social cognitive theory applies to all nations is because it does not say what is moral and immoral; it simply states that we can acknowledge these two concepts. Our actions in real-life scenarios are based on whether we believe the action is moral and whether the reward for violating our morals is significant enough, and nothing else.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;

== Limitations ==
=== Modelling and mass media ===
In series TV programming, according to social cognitive theory, the awarded behaviors of liked characters are supposed to be followed by viewers, while punished behaviors are supposed to be avoided by media consumers. However, in most cases, protagonists in TV shows are less likely to experience the long-term suffering and negative consequences caused by their risky behaviors, which could potentially undermine the punishments conveyed by the media, leading to a modeling of the risky behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nabi|first1=Robin L|last2=Clark|first2=Shannon|title=Exploring the limits of social cognitive theory: Why negatively reinforced behaviors on TV may be modeled anyway|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2008|volume=58|issue=3|pages=407–427|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00392.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nabi and Clark conducted experiments about individual’s attitudes and intentions consuming various portrayals of one-night stand sex– unsafe and [[risky sexual behavior]], finding that individuals who had not previously experience one night stand sex, consuming media portrayals of this behavior could significantly increase their expectations of having an one night stand sex in the future, although negative outcomes were represented in TV shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nabi|first1=Robin L|last2=Clark|first2=Shannon|title=Exploring the limits of social cognitive theory: Why negatively reinforced behaviors on TV may be modeled anyway|journal=Journal of Communication|date=2008|volume=58|issue=3|pages=407–427|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00392.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spontaneous generation''' refers to an obsolete body of thought on the ordinary formation of living organisms without descent from similar organisms. The theory of spontaneous generation held that living creatures could arise from nonliving matter and that such processes were commonplace and regular. For instance, it was hypothesized that certain forms such as fleas could arise from inanimate matter such as dust, or that [[maggot]]s could arise from dead flesh.&lt;ref name="Ball"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ball|first1=Philip|title=Man Made: A History of Synthetic Life|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=1|pages=15–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/man-made-a-history-of-synthetic-life|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant idea was that of '''equivocal generation''', in which species such as [[Cestoda|tapeworms]] arose from unrelated living organisms, now understood to be their [[Host (biology)|hosts]]. The idea of '''univocal generation''', by contrast, refers to effectively exclusive reproduction from genetically related parent(s), generally of the same [[species]].

The doctrine of spontaneous generation was coherently synthesized by [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brack, André |editor=Brack, André |title=The Molecular Origins of Life |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-56475-5 |page=1 |chapter=Introduction |chapterurl=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805215/64755/excerpt/9780521564755_excerpt.pdf | quote=Aristotle gathered the different claims into a real theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; who compiled and expanded the work of [[Pre-Socratic_philosophy|earlier natural philosophers]] and the various ancient explanations for the appearance of organisms, and was taken as scientific fact for two millennia. Though challenged in the 17th and 18th centuries by the experiments of [[Francesco Redi]] and [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]], spontaneous generation was not disproved until the work of [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[John Tyndall]] in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name= "TyndallFragments2"&gt;Tyndall, John; Fragments of Science, Vol 2, chapters IV, XII (1876), XIII(1878); Pub.

After sterilizing a nutrient broth in these flasks, he removed the swan necks of the controls. Microorganisms grew only in the controls, refuting spontaneous generation.&lt;ref name="Ball"/&gt;]]

Rejection of spontaneous generation is no longer controversial among biologists. By the middle of the 19th century, experiments of Louis Pasteur and others refuted the traditional theory of spontaneous generation and supported [[biogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Zubay, Geoffrey.

==Description and terms==

Spontaneous generation refers both to the supposed processes by which different types of life might repeatedly emerge from specific sources other than seeds, eggs, or parents, and also to theoretical principles presented in support of any such phenomena. Crucial to this doctrine are the ideas that life comes from non-life and that no causal agent, such as a parent, is needed. The hypothetical processes by which life routinely emerges from nonliving matter on a time scale of minutes, weeks, or years (e.g. in the supposed seasonal generation of mice and other animals from the mud of the [[Nile]]) are sometimes referred to as ''abiogenesis''.&lt;ref&gt;Stillingfleet, Edward. ''Origines Sacrae''. Cambridge University Press 1697. May be downloaded from [https://archive.org/details/originessacraeor00stil]&lt;/ref&gt; Such ideas have no operative principles in common with the modern hypothesis of [[abiogenesis]], which asserts that life emerged in the early ages of the planet, over a time span of at least millions of years, and subsequently diversified, and that there is no evidence of any subsequent repetition of the event.&lt;ref name="Bernal 1967"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernal |first=J. D. |year=1967 |origyear=Reprinted work by [[Alexander Oparin|A. I. Oparin]] originally published 1924; Moscow: [[Publishing houses in the Soviet Union|The Moscow Worker]] |title=The Origin of Life |series=The Weidenfeld and Nicolson Natural History |others=Translation of Oparin by Ann Synge |location=London |publisher=[[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] |lccn=67098482 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''equivocal generation'', sometimes known as ''heterogenesis'' or ''xenogenesis'', describes the supposed process by which one form of life arises from a different, unrelated form, such as tapeworms from the bodies of their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Wiener, Philip P. | title=Dictionary of the History of Ideas | accessdate=2009-01-22 | year=1973 | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons | location=New York | chapter=Spontaneous Generation | chapterurl=http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=DicHist/uvaBook/tei/DicHist1.xml;chunk.id=dv4-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following [[Louis Pasteur]]'s 1859 experiment, the term "spontaneous generation" fell increasingly out of favor. Experimentalists used a variety of terms for the study of the origin of life from nonliving materials. ''Heterogenesis'' was applied to the generation of living things from once-living organic matter (such as boiled broths), and [[Henry Charlton Bastian]] proposed the term ''archebiosis'' for life originating from inorganic materials. Disliking the randomness and unpredictability implied by the term "'spontaneous' generation," in 1870 Bastian coined the term ''biogenesis'' to refer to the formation of life from nonliving matter. Soon thereafter, however, English biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] proposed the term ''[[abiogenesis]]'' to refer to this same process and adopted ''[[biogenesis]]'' for the process by which life arises from existing life; it is this latter set of definitions that became dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strick |first=James |title=Evolution &amp; The Spontaneous Generation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjKplNQv9zoC&amp;pg=PR11 |accessdate=August 27, 2012 |date=April 15, 2001 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-85506-872-8|pages=xi–xxiv |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==
===Presocratic philosophers===
Active in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE, early Greek philosophers, called ''physiologoi'' in antiquity (Greek: φυσιολόγοι; in English, physical or [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]]), attempted to give natural explanations of [[phenomena]] that had previously been ascribed to the agency of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie|Guthrie, William Keith Chambers]], ''The Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'', p. 13, {{ISBN|0-317-66577-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''physiologoi'' sought the material principle or ''[[arche]]'' (Greek: ἀρχή) of things, emphasizing the rational unity of the external world and rejecting theological or mythological explanations.&lt;ref name="seyffert480"&gt;Seyffert, Oskar (1894), ''Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'', page 480&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Anaximander]], who believed that all things arose from the elemental nature of the universe, the ''[[Apeiron_(cosmology)|apeiron]]'' (ἄπειρον) or the "unbounded" or "infinite," was likely the first western thinker to propose that life developed spontaneously from nonliving matter. The [[substance theory|primal chaos]] of the ''apeiron,'' eternally in motion, served as a substratum in which elemental opposites (e.g., wet and dry, hot and cold) generated and shaped the many and varied things in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Legacy of Parmenides: Eleatic Monism and Later Presocratic Thought |author=Curd, Patricia |year=1998 |publisher=Princeton University Press| page=77 |isbn=0-691-01182-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2JX1ulXzogC&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hippolytus of Rome]] in the third century CE, Anaximander claimed that fish or fish-like creatures were first formed in the "wet" when acted on by the heat of the sun and that these aquatic creatures gave rise to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kahn |first1=Charles H. |title=Anaximander and the Origins of Greek Cosmology |date=1994 |publisher=Hackett Publishing |isbn=0872202550 |pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Censorinus, writing in the 3rd century, reports:

{{quote|text=Anaximander of Miletus considered that from warmed up water and earth emerged either fish or entirely fishlike animals. Inside these animals, men took form and embryos were held prisoners until puberty; only then, after these animals burst open, could men and women come out, now able to feed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Censorinus, ''De Die Natali'', IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], a pupil of Anaximander, thought that air was the element that imparted life and endowed creatures with motion and thought. He proposed that plants and animals, including human beings, arose from a primordial terrestrial slime, a mixture of earth and water, combined with the sun's heat. [[Anaxagoras]], too, believed that life emerged from a terrestrial slime. However, he held that the seeds of plants existed in the air from the beginning, and those of animals in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]]. [[Xenophanes]] traced the origin of man back to the transitional period between the fluid stage of the earth and the formation of land, under the influence of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Osborn |first=Henry Fairfield |authorlink=Henry Fairfield Osborn |title=From the Greeks to Darwin: An outline of the development of the evolution idea|date=1894 |publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In what has occasionally been seen as a prefiguration of a concept of [[natural selection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |authorlink=Conway Zirkle |title=Natural Selection before the "Origin of Species" |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |date=1941 |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=71–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empedocles]] accepted the spontaneous generation of life but held that different forms, made up of differing combinations of parts, spontaneously arose as though by trial and error: successful combinations formed the species we now see, whereas unsuccessful forms failed to reproduce.

===Aristotle===
{{main|Aristotle's biology}}
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|300px|[[Aristotle]] proposed that in sexual reproduction, the child inherits [[Hylomorphism|form]] (eidos) from the father and matter from the mother, as well as heat (pneuma) either from the father or from the environment.&lt;ref name=Leroi2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |pages=215–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spontaneous generation, the environment could effectively replace the parents' contributions of form, matter, and heat.&lt;ref name=Lehoux2017p22/&gt;]]

In his biological works, the natural philosopher Aristotle theorized extensively the reproduction of various animals, whether by [[sexual reproduction|sexual]], [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]], or spontaneous generation. In accordance with his fundamental theory of [[hylomorphism]], which held that every physical entity was a compound of matter and form, Aristotle's basic theory of sexual reproduction contended that the [[semen|male's seed]] imposed form, the set of characteristics passed down to offspring on the "matter" (menstrual blood) supplied by the female. Thus female matter is the [[Four_causes#Matter|material cause]] of generation—it supplies the matter that will constitute the offspring—while the male semen is the [[Four_causes#Agent|efficient cause]], the factor that instigates and delineates the thing's existence.&lt;ref name=Leroi2014/&gt; Yet, as proposed in the ''[[History of Animals]]'', many creatures form not through sexual processes but by spontaneous generation:

{{quote|Now there is one property that animals are found to have in common with plants. For some plants are generated from the seed of plants, whilst other plants are self-generated through the formation of some elemental principle similar to a seed; and of these latter plants some derive their nutriment from the ground, whilst others grow inside other plants ... So with animals, some spring from parent animals according to their kind, whilst others grow spontaneously and not from kindred stock; and of these instances of spontaneous generation some come from putrefying earth or vegetable matter, as is the case with a number of insects, while others are spontaneously generated in the inside of animals out of the secretions of their several organs.&lt;ref name="HistAnimV"&gt;{{cite book | author=Aristotle | authorlink=Aristotle |others=translated by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson | title=History of Animals | url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/history/ | accessdate=2008-12-20 | volume=| origyear=c. 343 BCE | year=1910 | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | chapter=Book V | chapterurl=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/history/book5.html | isbn=90-6186-973-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Aristotle|''[[History of Animals]]'', Book V, Part 1}}

According to this theory, living things may come forth from nonliving things in a manner roughly analogous to the "enformation of the female matter by the agency of the male seed" seen in sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name=Lehoux2017p22&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lehoux |first1=Daryn |title=Creatures Born of Mud and Slime: The Wonder and Complexity of Spontaneous Generation |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonliving materials, like the seminal fluid present in sexual generation, contain ''[[pneuma]]'' (πνεῦμα, "breath"), or "[[vital heat]]". According to Aristotle, pneuma had more "heat" than regular air did, and this heat endowed the substance with certain vital properties:
{{quote|The power of every soul seems to have shared in a different and more divine body than the so called [four] elements ... For every [animal], what makes the seed generative inheres in the seed and is called its "heat." But this is not fire or some such power, but instead the pneuma that is enclosed in the seed and in foamy matter, this being analogous to the element of the stars. This is why fire does not generate any animal ... but the heat of the sun and the heat of animals does, not only the heat that fills the seed, but also any other residue of [the animal's] nature that may exist similarly possesses this vital principle.|Aristotle|''[[Generation of Animals]]'', 736b29ff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lehoux |first1=Daryn |title=Creatures Born of Mud and Slime: The Wonder and Complexity of Spontaneous Generation |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle drew an analogy between the "foamy matter" (τὸ ἀφρῶδες) found in nature and the "seed" of an animal, which he viewed as being a kind of foam itself (composed, as it was, from a mixture of water and pneuma). For Aristotle, the generative materials of male and female animals (semen and menstrual blood) were essentially refinements, made by male and female bodies according to their respective proportions of heat, of ingested food, which was, in turn, a byproduct of the elements earth and water. Thus any creature, whether generated sexually from parents or spontaneously through the interaction of vital heat and elemental matter, was dependent on the proportions of pneuma and the various elements which Aristotle believed comprised all things.&lt;ref name="Lehoux2017p26"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lehoux |first1=Daryn |title=Creatures Born of Mud and Slime |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Aristotle recognized that many living things emerged from putrefying matter, he pointed out that the putrefaction was not the source of life, but the byproduct of the action of the "sweet" element of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Aristotle | authorlink=Aristotle |others=translated by Arthur Platt | title=On the Generation of Animals | url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/generation/ | accessdate=2009-01-09 | origyear=c. 350 BCE | year=1912 | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | chapter=Book III | chapterurl=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/generation/book3.html | isbn=90-04-09603-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With varying degrees of observational confidence, Aristotle theorized the spontaneous generation of a range of creatures from different sorts of inanimate matter. The [[testacea]]ns (a genus which for Aristotle included [[bivalvia|bivalves]] and snails), for instance, were characterized by spontaneous generation from mud, but differed based upon the precise material they grew in—for example, [[clam]]s and [[scallop]]s in sand, [[oyster]]s in slime, and the [[barnacle]] and the [[limpet]] in the hollows of rocks.&lt;ref name=HistAnimV/&gt;

As the dominant view of philosophers and thinkers continued to be in favour of spontaneous generation, some Christian theologians accepted the view. [[Augustine of Hippo]] discussed spontaneous generation in ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' and ''The Literal Meaning of Genesis'', citing Biblical passages such as "Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life" ({{bibleverse||Genesis|1:20|KJV|}}) as decrees that would enable ongoing creation.&lt;ref name ="irisfry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fry | first=Iris | title=The Emergence of Life on Earth |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fo7tQ5mG21IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA17,M1| chapter=Chapter 2: Spontaneous Generation — Ups and Downs | accessdate=2009-01-21 | year=2000 | publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-2740-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]] in 5th century to the [[East-West Schism]] in 1054, the influence of Greek science declined, although spontaneous generation generally went unchallenged. New descriptions were made. Of the numerous beliefs, some had doctrinal implications outside of the [[Book of Genesis]]. For example, the idea that a variety of bird known as the ''[[barnacle goose#Folklore|barnacle goose]]'' emerged from a crustacean known as the ''[[goose barnacle]]'', had implications on the practice of fasting during [[Lent]].  In 1188, [[Gerald of Wales]], after having traveled in Ireland, argued that the "unnatural" generation of barnacle geese was evidence for the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Giraldus Cambrensis | authorlink=Gerald of Wales | title=Topographia Hiberniae | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1188geraldwales-barnacle.html | accessdate=2009-02-01 | year=1188 | isbn=0-85105-386-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the practice of fasting during Lent allowed fish, but prohibited fowl, the idea that the goose was in fact a fish suggested that its consumption be permitted during Lent. The practice was eventually prohibited by decree of [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1215.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lankester | first=Sir Edwin Ray | authorlink=Edwin Lankester | title=Diversions of a Naturalist | url=https://books.google.com/?id=d1GnwwmfvC8C&amp;printsec=frontcover | accessdate= 2009-02-01 | edition=illustrated | origyear=1915 | year=1970 | publisher=Ayer Publishing | isbn=978-0-8369-1471-9 |pages=117–128 | chapter=XIV.

Aristotle, in Arabic translation, was reintroduced to Western Europe.  During the 13th century, Aristotle reached his greatest acceptance. With the availability of Latin translations Saint [[Albertus Magnus]] and his student, Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], raised Aristotelianism to its greatest prominence. Albert wrote a paraphrase of Aristotle, ''De causis et processu universitatis'', in which he removed some and incorporated other commentaries by Arabic scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | date=March 20, 2006 | contribution=Albert the Great | contribution-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/albert-great/ | editor-last=Zalta | editor-first=Edward N. | editor-link=Edward N.

Spontaneous generation is discussed as a fact in literature well into the [[Renaissance]].  Where, in passing, [[Shakespeare]] discusses snakes and crocodiles forming from the mud of the [[Nile]] ({{Shakecite|Ant|F1|2|7}}), [[Izaak Walton]] again raises the question of the origin of eels "as rats and mice, and many other living creatures, are bred in Egypt, by the sun's heat when it shines upon the overflowing of the river...". While the ancient question of the origin of eels remained unanswered and the additional idea that eels reproduced from corruption of age was mentioned, the spontaneous generation of rats and mice engendered no debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Walton | first=Izaak | authorlink=Izaak Walton | others=transcribed by Risa Bear | title=The Compleat Angler or the Contemplative Man's Recreation | url=http://www.uoregon.edu/~rbear/walton/index.html | accessdate=2009-02-05 | origyear=1653 | year=1903  | publisher=George Bell &amp; Sons  | chapter=XIII.

The Dutch biologist and microscopist [[Jan Swammerdam]] (1637 - 1680) rejected the concept that one animal could arise from another or from putrification by chance because it was impious and like others found the concept of spontaneous generation irreligious, and he associated it with atheism and Godless opinion.&lt;ref name="OslerFarber2002"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Osler, Margaret J. |author2=Farber, Paul Lawrence |title=Religion, Science, and Worldview: Essays in Honor of Richard S.

[[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] (1580–1644) used experimental techniques, such as growing a willow for five years and showing it increased mass while the soil showed a trivial decrease in comparison.  As the process of [[photosynthesis]] was not understood, he attributed the increase of mass to the absorption of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Ducheyne | first=Steffen | year=2006 | title=Joan Baptista van Helmont and the Question of Experimental Modernism | pages=305–332 | url=http://logica.ugent.be/steffen/Physis%20-%20Van%20Helmont.pdf | accessdate=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; His notes also describe a recipe for mice (a piece of soiled cloth plus wheat for 21 days) and scorpions (basil, placed between two bricks and left in sunlight).

Where Aristotle held that the embryo was formed by a coagulation in the uterus, [[William Harvey]] (1578 – 1657) by way of [[dissection]] of [[deer]], showed that there was no visible embryo during the first month.&lt;ref name=embryology&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/2451/Embryology-History-embryology-science.html | title=Embryology - History Of Embryology As A Science | accessdate=2009-01-09 | author1=Magner, Lois |author2=Lerner, K.

The ancient beliefs were subjected to testing.  In 1668, [[Francesco Redi]] challenged the idea that maggots arose spontaneously from rotting meat.  In the first major [[experiment]] to challenge spontaneous generation, he placed meat in a variety of sealed, open, and partially covered containers.&lt;ref name="slowdeath"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://webprojects.oit.ncsu.edu/project/bio183de/Black/cellintro/cellintro_reading/Spontaneous_Generation.html | title=The Slow Death of Spontaneous Generation (1668-1859) | accessdate=2008-12-19 | author=Levine, Russell |author2=Evers, Chris | year=1999 | publisher=National Health Museum | location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Realizing that the sealed containers were deprived of air, he used "fine Naples veil", and observed no worm on the meat, but they appeared on the cloth.&lt;ref name="fredi"&gt;{{cite book | author=Redi, Francesco | authorlink=Francesco Redi |editor=Mab Bigelow (translator) | title=Experiments on the Generation of Insects | url=https://books.google.com/?id=w7ZRAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Francesco+Redi+experiment&amp;printsec=frontcover | accessdate=2008-12-19 | origyear=1669 | year=1909 | publisher=Open Court | location=Chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt; Redi used his experiments to support the preexistence theory put forth by the Church at that time, which maintained that living things originated from parents.&lt;ref name="Fry2000"&gt;{{cite book |author=Fry, Iris |title=Emergence of Life on Earth: A Historical and Scientific Overview |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fo7tQ5mG21IC&amp;pg=PA27 |accessdate=14 October 2012 |date=1 February 2000 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-2740-6 |pages=27–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In scientific circles Redi's work very soon had great influence, as evidenced in a letter from [[John Ray]] in 1671 to members of the [[Royal Society]] of London:

{{quote|Whether there be any spontaneous or anomalous generation of animals, as has been the constant opinion of naturalists heretofore, I think there is good reason to question. It seems to me at present most probable, that there is no such thing; but that even all insects are the natural issue of parents of the same species with themselves. F. Redi has gone a good way in proving this, having cleared the point concerning generation ''ex materia putrida''. But still there remain two great difficulties. The first is, to give an account of the production of insects bred in the by-fruits and excrescencies of vegetables, which the said Redi doubts not to ascribe to the vegetative soul of the plant that yields those excrescencies. But for this I refer you to Mr. Lister. The second, to render an account of insects bred in the bodies of other animals. I hope shortly to be able to give you an account of the generation of some of those insects which have been thought to be spontaneous, and which seem as unlikely as any to be after the ordinary and usual way.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Society (Great Britain); Hutton, Charles, 1737-1823; Shaw, George, 1751-1813; Pearson, Richard, 1765-1836.

[[Pier Antonio Micheli]], around 1729, observed that when fungal spores were placed on slices of melon the same type of fungi were produced that the spores came from, and from this observation he noted that fungi did not arise from spontaneous generation.&lt;ref name="Agrios2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Agrios, George N. |title=Plant Pathology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnzbgZgby60C&amp;pg=PA17 |accessdate=14 August 2012 |year=2005 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-044565-3 |pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1745, [[John Needham]] performed a series of experiments on boiled broths.  Believing that boiling would kill all living things, he showed that when sealed right after boiling, the broths would cloud, allowing the belief in spontaneous generation to persist.  His studies were rigorously scrutinized by his peers and many of them agreed.&lt;ref name="slowdeath" /&gt;

[[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] modified the Needham experiment in 1768, attempting to exclude the possibility of introducing a contaminating factor between boiling and sealing. His technique involved boiling the broth in a sealed container with the air partially evacuated to prevent explosions.  Although he did not see growth, the exclusion of air left the question of whether air was an essential factor in spontaneous generation.&lt;ref name="slowdeath" /&gt; However, by that time there was already widespread scepticism among major scientists, to the principle of spontaneous generation. Observation was increasingly demonstrating that whenever there was sufficiently careful investigation of mechanisms of biological reproduction, it was plain that processes involved basing of new structures on existing complex structures, rather from chaotic muds or dead materials. [[Joseph Priestley]], after he had fled to America and not long before his death, wrote a letter that was read to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1803. It said in part:

{{quote|There is nothing in modern philosophy that appears to me so extraordinary, as the revival of what has long been considered as the exploded doctrine of equivocal, or, as Dr. Darwin calls it, spontaneous generation; by which is meant the production of organized bodies from substances that have no organization, as plants and animals from no pre-existing germs of the same kinds, plants without seeds, and animals without sexual intercourse.

The germ of an organized body, the seed of a plant, or the embrio of an animal, in its first discoverable state, is now found to be the future plant or animal in miniature, containing every thing essential to it when full grown, only requiring to have the several organs enlarged, and the interstices filled with extraneous nutritious matter. When the external form undergoes the greatest change, as from an aquatic insect to a flying gnat, a caterpillar to a crysalis, a crysalis to a butterfly, or a tadpole to a frog, there is nothing new in the organization; all the parts of the gnat, the butterfly, and the frog, having really existed, though not appearing to the common observer in the forms in which they are first seen. In like manner, every thing essential to the oak is found in the acorn.&lt;ref name="PriestleySG" &gt;Priestley, Joseph.

In 1837, [[Charles Cagniard de la Tour]], a physicist, and [[Theodor Schwann]], one of the founders of cell theory, published their independent discovery of [[yeast]] in [[alcoholic fermentation]].  They used the [[microscope]] to examine foam left over from the process of brewing [[beer]].  Where [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]] described "small spheroid globules", they observed yeast cells undergo [[cell division]].  Fermentation would not occur when sterile air or pure oxygen was introduced if yeast were not present.  This suggested that airborne [[microorganisms]], not spontaneous generation, was responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Springer | first=Alfred | date=October 13, 1892 | title=The Micro-organisms of the Soil | journal=Nature | volume=46 | issue=1198 | pages=576–579 | publisher=Nature Publishing Group | issn=0028-0836| url=https://books.google.com/?id=LHkCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PT138&amp;lpg=PT138 | doi=10.1038/046576b0|bibcode=1892Natur..46R.576. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although the idea of spontaneous generation had been in decline for nearly a century, its supporters did not abandon it all at once. As [[James Rennie]] wrote:

{{quote|...inability to trace the origin of minute plants and insects led to the doctrine of what is called spontaneous or equivocal generation, of which the fancies above-mentioned are some 'of the prominent branches. The experiments of Redi on the hatching of insects from eggs, which were published at Florence in 1668, first brought discredit upon this doctrine, though it had always a few eminent disciples. At present it is maintained by a considerable number -of distinguished naturalists, such as Blumenbach, Cuvier, Bory de St. Vincent, R. Brown, &amp;c. "The notion or spontaneous generation," says Bory, " is at first revolting to a rational mind, but it is, notwithstanding, demonstrable by the microscope. The fact is averred : Willer has seen it, I have seen it, and twenty other observers have seen it: the pandorinia exhibit it every instant. "These pandorinia he elsewhere describes as probably nothing more than " animated scions of Zoocarpae".  It would be unprofitable to go into any lengthened discussion upon this mysterious subject; and we have great doubts whether the ocular demonstration by the microscope would succeed except in the hands of a disciple of the school. Even with naturalists, whose business it is to deal with facts, the reason is often wonderfully influenced by the imagination...&lt;ref name=JRIT&gt;Rennie, James. Insect Transformations. Page 10.

===Pasteur and Tyndall===

[[Louis Pasteur]]'s 1859 experiment is widely seen as having settled the question of spontaneous generation.  He boiled a meat broth in a flask that had a long neck that curved downward, like that of a goose or swan.  The idea was that the bend in the neck prevented falling particles from reaching the broth, while still allowing the free flow of air.  The flask remained free of growth for an extended period.  When the flask was turned so that particles could fall down the bends, the broth quickly became clouded.&lt;ref name="slowdeath" /&gt; However, minority objections were persistent and not always unreasonable, given that the experimental difficulties were far more challenging than the popular accounts suggest. The investigations of [[John Tyndall]], a correspondent of Pasteur and a great admirer of Pasteur's work, were decisive in disproving spontaneous generation and dealing with lingering issues. Still, even Tyndall encountered difficulties in dealing with the effects of [[Endospore |microbial spores]], which were not well understood in his day. Like Pasteur, he boiled his cultures to sterilize them, and some types of bacterial spores can survive boiling. The [[autoclave]], which eventually came into universal application in medical practice and microbiology to sterilise equipment, was not an instrument that had come into use at the time of Tyndall's experiments, let alone those of Pasteur.&lt;ref name= "TyndallFragments2"/&gt;

In 1862, the [[French Academy of Sciences]] paid a special attention to the issue and established a prize "to him who by well-conducted experiments throws new light on the question of the so-called spontaneous generation" and appointed a commission to judge the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Engelhardt |first1=Hugo Tristram |last2=Caplan |first2=Arthur L. |title=Scientific Controversies: Case Studies in the Resolution and Closure of Disputes in Science and Technology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nkSX63VsLkC&amp;pg=PA107 |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-27560-6 |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Belz, Frank-Martin.,&lt;ref&gt;Frank-Martin B. and Peattie, K. (2009). Sustainability Marketing: A Global Perspective. Wiley, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; the definition of sustainable product has six characteristics:
* [[Customer satisfaction]]: any products or services that do not meet customer needs will not survive in the market in a long term.
* Dual focus: compared with purely environmental products, sustainable products focus both on ecological and social significance.
* Life-cycle orientation: sustainable product is constantly environmental-friendly during its entire life. That is, from the moment the raw materials are extracted to the moment the final product is disposed of, there must be no permanent damage to the environment.
* Significant improvements: sustainable products have to contribute to dealing with socio-ecological problems on a global level, or provide measurable improvements in socio-ecological product performance.
* [[Continuous improvement process|Continuous improvement]]: since the state of knowledge, technologies and societal expectation keep on developing, so sustainable products should also be continuously improved regarding social and environmental variation.
* Competing offers: sustainable products may still lag behind competing offers, therefore, the competing offers may serve as a [[wikt:benchmark|benchmark]] regarding social and ecological performance.

[[Michael Braungart]] and [[William McDonough]]'s book ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Michael Braungart and William McDonough (2002). Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things. North Point Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; expands on the life-cycle part of this definition. They suggest that we should make every material and product so that it can be disassembled when its use is over, and so that all the materials of which it is made can then be returned to the Earth after composting, or endlessly recycled as raw materials.

=== Sustainable product standards ===

=== Overall standards ===
'''Nordic Swan Ecolabel'''
The standard of [[Nordic swan|Nordic Swan Ecolabel]], which is distributed in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]] and [[Iceland]], mainly refers to distinguish products that have a positive effect on the environment. Or rather, it has climate requirements that limit the amount of CO2 emissions where it is most relevant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nordic-ecolabel.org/criteria/product-groups/&lt;/ref&gt; More than 3,000 products, mainly household chemicals, paper products, office machinery and building materials have been issued with this label. The criteria account environmental factors through the product's life cycle (raw material extraction, production and distribution, use and refuse). Thus the most important parameters are consumption of natural resources and energy, emissions into air, water and soil, generation of waste and noise.

'''Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)'''

[[Global Reporting Initiative|GRI]] frames out and disseminates global sustainability reporting guidelines for ‘voluntary use by organizations reporting on the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of their activities, products and services’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalreporting.org/ReportingFramework/G31Guidelines/&lt;/ref&gt; According to GRI Guidelines, reporters should take into consideration stakeholders’ interests and use the [[social indicator]]s and others that more accurately depict the social and ecological performance of the organization.

'''Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)'''

[[Life-cycle assessment|LCA]] evaluates and discloses the environmental benefits of products over their full life cycle, from raw materials extraction to final disposition. Since 1997 the process of conducting LCA studies has been standardized by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).

=== Product-oriented standards ===
'''Organic Food Labeling'''[[File:National Organic Program.jpg|thumb|right|The National Organic Program (run by the USDA) is responsible for the legal definition of organic in the United States and issue organic certification.]]
[[Organic food]] are foods that are produced using methods involving no agricultural synthetic inputs, for instance, synthetic [[pesticide]]s, [[chemical fertilizer]]s, [[genetically modified organism]]s (GMO), and are not processed using [[irradiation]], industrial [[solvent]]s, or chemical [[food additive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Gary J. &amp; Albala, Ken, ed (2007). The business of food: encyclopedia of the food and drink industries. ABC-CLIO. p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the [[United States]], [[European Union]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]] and many other industrialized countries require food producers to acquire special critieria or certification to market their products as "organic". Apparently, organic food producers emphasize sustainable [[Conservation biology|conservation]] of the social-ecological attributes such as soil, water and the whole ecosystem. International organizations such as the [[Organic Consumers Association]] supervise the development of organic food. According to the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP) in the US, a voluntary green-and-white seal on foods’ packaging denotes that a product is at least 95% organic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/nop&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MSC Labeling'''

The [[Marine Stewardship Council]] (MSC) is an independent non-profit organization which was established in 1997 in order to cope with the [[overfishing]] problem. Fisheries that are assessed and meet the standard can use the MSC blue ecolabel. The MSC mission is to 'reward sustainable fishing practices’. As of the end of 2010, more than 1,300 fisheries and companies had achieved a Marine Stewardship Council certification.&lt;ref&gt;List of Companies certified to MSC. www.ekobai.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FSC Labeling'''

The [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) is an international non-profit organization established in 1993 to ‘promote forest management that is environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial and economically viable’.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsc.org&lt;/ref&gt; Its main responsibilities for achieving the goal are standard framing, independent certification issuing and labeling. FSC directly or indirectly addresses issues such as [[illegal logging]], [[deforestation]] and [[global warming]] and has positive effects on [[economic development]], [[environmental conservation]], [[poverty alleviation]] and social and political empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;effects of FSC Certification in Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Russia, Sweden and the UK. WWF (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Experiences with voluntary standards initiatives and related multi-stakeholder dialogues. B. Lang. GTZ (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fair Trade Labeling'''
[[File:EKO symbol RGB.jpg|right|thumb|[[EKOenergy]] is an ecolabel for energy in Europe]]
Although there is no universally accepted definition of [[fair trade]], Fair trade Labeling Organizations International (FLO) most commonly refer to a definition developed by FINE, an informal association of four international fair trade networks (Fair trade Labeling Organizations International, [[World Fair Trade Organization]] - formerly International Fair Trade Association, [[Network of European Worldshops]] and [[European Fair Trade Association]]): fair trade is a trading partnership, based on dialogue, transparency and respect, that seeks greater equity in international trade. It contributes to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers – especially in the South. Fair trade organizations, backed by consumers, are engaged actively in supporting producers, awareness raising and in campaigning for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Labelling Organizations International www.fairtrade.net&lt;/ref&gt;

'''U. S. Green Building Council LEED Rating System'''

The LEED Green Building Rating System evaluates environmental performance of all buildings over their life, providing the definitive standard for what constitutes a [[Green building|"green" building]], persuading the consumer and building industry to develop products that are more environmentally and economically viable.&lt;ref&gt;LEEDv3". US Green Building Council. http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1970. Retrieved 20 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EKOenergy label'''

[[EKOenergy]] is an ecolabel originating in Finland. It is becoming the continent wide ecolabel for energy, which is supported by number European NGOs. It evaluates sustainability of electricity products on open energy markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.res-e.org |title= Renewable Electricity Standard for Europe|author= |year= 2012|work= RES-E Standard|publisher= RES-E Initiative Group|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green Seal'''

[[Green Seal]] is a North American non-profit ecolabel organization established in 1989. It generates life cycle-based sustainability standards for products, services and companies in addition to offering third party [[independent test organization]] certification for those meeting its standards. Green Seal was the first non-profit environmental certification program established in the [[United States]]. It currently has certified nearly 4,000 products and services within 400 categories.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainability at Yellowstone http://www.yellowstonenationalparklodges.com/environment/green-seal-certification/green-seal/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainable product policies ==
'''International'''

Since 1998, the branch of the '''[[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP)''' has undertaken several national programs or action plans on [[sustainable consumption]] and production.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP (2007), Assessment of Policy instruments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from Buildings.http://www.unep.org/themes/consumption/index.asp?page=home&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[United Nations]] is responsible for administrating the Marrakech Process&lt;ref&gt;http://esa.un.org/marrakechprocess/&lt;/ref&gt; and developing the ten-year Sustainable Consumption and Production Framework through Regional Marrakech Process Consultations, whose goal is to accelerate the shift towards sustainable consumption and production (SCP). 
'''[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD)'''’s Environmental Directorate has also done comprehensive work on the environmental impacts of sustainable consumption and production. One of current OECD projects is reviewing measures for sustainable manufacturing production.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (1999), Towards More Sustainable Household Consumption Patterns. http://www.oecd.org/document/58/0,2340,en_2649_34331_2397498_1_1_1_1,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regions and countries'''

'''European Union''': on 16 July 2008 the [[European Commission]] presented the Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy (SCP/SIP) Action Plan&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (2011), [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eussd/escp_en.htm Sustainable Consumption and  Production and Sustainable Industrial  Policy Action Plan].&lt;/ref&gt; which clarifies the United Nations’ Marrakech Process on Sustainable Consumption and Production and global ten-year Sustainable Consumption and Production Framework and it is finally adopted by the Council on 4 December 2008 and is updated regularly. It includes a series of proposals on sustainable consumption and production to target EU goals for [[environmental sustainability]], [[economic growth]] and [[public welfare]], which are as follows:
* A proposal to extend mandatory labeling requirements which is relevant to the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of products according to the 1992 Energy Labeling Directive.
* A proposal to widen the covering fields of voluntary [[EU Ecolabel]] of products (e.g., including food and beverage products) and streamline the system.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/ecodesign/product-policy/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Energy label en.svg|thumb|right|Sample EU energy efficiency label]]
* A proposal for an independent communication on green public procurement. This communication identifies economic priority sectors, establishes common environmental criteria and  guides to implement green public procurement by Member States.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/publicprocurement/modernising_rules/conferences/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* A proposal for the revision of the EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) to enlarge the number of companies involved, including companies outside the EU, and decrease the administrative costs for Small and Mediums Sized Enterprises (SMEs).&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/environment/emas/index_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* Proposals on sustainable consumption and production that will contribute to improve the environmental efficiency of products and increase the demand for more pro-environmental goods and production technologies.

'''The [[United States]]''' government does not have a standardized national policy or strategy for sustainable consumption and production. However, the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) develops extensive sustainability programs on water, agriculture, energy, and ecosystem, etc. At the same time, the [[U.S. Department of State]]’s Sustainable Development Partnerships web page provides considerable information about the U.S. government's sustainable development initiatives to help other countries set up and implement their own development strategies in social and ecological terms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/oswer/international/factsheets/200810-sustainable-consumption-and-production.htm#UNEP&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[United Kingdom]]''' government considers Sustainable Consumption and Production is one of the four priority sectors identified in the 2005 UK Sustainable Development Strategy. The UK government is carrying out a series of actions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/products-consumers/&lt;/ref&gt;  to achieve goals of sustainable consumption and production in public and private areas respectively.

'''Norwegian''' Ministry of the Environment founded [[Norway]]’s Green in Practice (GRIP), which is a public-private foundation established in 1996 to promote sustainable consumption and production. At the same time, Norway’s Ministry of Finance has primary responsibility to fund the strategy of sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;http://greennow.net/Felles/english.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Australia]]n''' government requires that certain electrical products for sale should contain mandatory energy-efficiency labeling to provide consumers with information that helps reduce energy use and green house gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energyrating.gov.au/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sustainable product design ==
{{See also|Sustainable design}}
Conventionally, [[environmental management system]]s have always addressed the impacts of products on local surroundings. ISO 14001 (ISO 14001:3) provides a formalized framework for managing significant environmental aspects and improving environmental performance through a ‘‘Plan, Do, Check, Review’’ continual improvement cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Donnelly K, Olds R, Blechinger F, Reynolds D and Beckett-Fumell Z (2004): [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225664765_ISO_14001_-_Effective_management_of_sustainable_design ISO 14001 – effective management of sustainable design]. The Journal of Sustainable Product Design 4:43–54.&lt;/ref&gt;
During the phase of [[product planning]], consumer demands and market opportunities are evaluated. At this time a product description and execution plans for a successful program launch are developed and product requirements are defined.
During the phase of product development, specific design specifications are finalized, models are built, and designs are reviewed and released for manufacture planning. Once manufacturing begins, the product is commercially launched for general availability and volume deployed to the marketplace. Once a [[prototype]] is available, LCA is used as a fundamental standard to identify significant social and environmental aspects and quantify environmental impact.
Once a product is launched into market and becomes commercialized, it enters the maturity phase, which means that the sales and the profits both reach the peak. The maturity phase contains two stages: during the first stage of maturity, the customer is utilizing the product. Modifications may still be made to the product to enhance or change it. The product enters the second stage of maturity when it approaches near to the decline phase. 
Where applicable, end-of-life products are taken back and subsequently reused or recycled efficiently. While being a legal requirement in the EU, the take back of end-of-life products offers the chance to review the final life cycle stage of a product through direct contact with recyclers. This knowledge can then be applied to future designs and product improvement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3160">'''Synergetics coordinates''' is Clifford Nelson's attempt to describe, from another mathematical point of view, [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s '60 degree coordinate system' for understanding nature.  [[Synergetics (Fuller)|Synergetics]] is the word Fuller used to label his approach to [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;
Clifford Nelson, [http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/600/ Buckminster Fuller Notebooks]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometric definition==
A [[Theory of forms|system]] of synergetics [[coordinates]] uses only one type of [[simplex]] ([[triangle]], [[tetrahedron]], [[pentachoron]], ..., n-simplex) as [[space]] units, and in fact uses a [[regular simplex]], rather like [[Cartesian coordinates]] use [[hypercubes]] ([[Square (geometry)|square]], [[cube]], [[tesseract]], ..., n-cube.)

[[Image:Synergetics coordinate plane.jpg|right|thumb|Synergetics coordinates in two dimensions]]

The n Synergetics coordinates axes are perpendicular to the n defining geometric objects that define a regular simplex; 2 end points for line segments, 3 lines for triangles, 4 planes for tetrahedrons etc.. The angles between the directions of the coordinate axes are Arc Cosine (-1/(n-1)). The coordinates can be positive or negative or zero and so can their sum. The sum of the n coordinates is the edge length of the regular simplex defined by moving the n  geometric objects in increments of the height of the n-1 dimensional regular simplex that has an edge length of one. If the sum of the n coordinates is negative the triangle (n = 3) or tetrahedron (n = 4) is upside down and inside out.

==Algebraic examples==
Regular [[triangular coordinates]] are in a [[Lattice graph|grid]] of [[equilateral]] triangles and are of the form &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; are equal to or greater than 0.

Regular tetrahedral coordinates are in a [[Euclidean space|Euclidean 3-space]] 'grid' of equilateral tetrahedra and are of the form &lt;math&gt;(w,x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;w,x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; are equal to or greater than 0.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8144">A '''tax-benefit model''' is a form of [[microsimulation]] model. It is usually based on a representative or administrative [[data set]] and certain policy rules. These models are used to ''cost'' certain policy [[reform]]s and to determine the winners and losers of [[reform]]. One example is [[Euromod|EUROMOD]] which models taxes and benefits for 28 [[European Union|EU]] states.

== Overview ==
Tax-benefit models are used by policy makers and researchers to examine the effects of proposed or hypothetical policy changes on income inequality, poverty and government budget. Their primary advantage over conventional cross-country comparison method is that they are very powerful at evaluating policy changes not only ''ex post'', but also ''ex ante''.

Generally, tax-benefit models can simulate income taxes, property taxes, social contributions, social assistance, income benefits and other benefits.

The underlying micro-data are obtained mainly through household surveys. These data include information about households' income, expenditure and family composition.

Most of the tax-benefit models are operated by governments or research institutions. Very few models are publicly available.

Depending on their purpose, tax-benefit models may or may not ignore behavioral responses of individuals.

== General framework ==
The basic steps in conducting research using a simple tax-benefit model are:

# Gross micro-data describing households' income, expenditure and family composition are collected and processed;
# These data enter a tax-benefit model;
# First simulation takes place;
# Disposable income of each household is calculated and the results of the simulation are summarized;
# A set of rules of the policies enters the model and the second simulation takes place;
# Disposable income of each household is calculated and the results of the simulation are summarized;
# The impact of the set of policy changes is evaluated by comparing the results from the two simulations.

A dynamic tax-benefit model [http://people.svv.lu/tools/polisim/ PoliSim's webpage] provides an illustration diagram of the process. Since this model is dynamic, it also requires data on probabilistic characteristics of the underlying population. These data would be created in step 1 and enter the model in step 2.

== Taxonomy ==
Basically, there are two properties that make given tax-benefit models different from each other. A model can be:

# Arithmetical or behavioral;
# Static or dynamic.

=== Arithmetical vs. behavioral tax-benefit models ===
Arithmetical tax-benefit models can be viewed as advanced calculators. They typically show only direct effects of the reform on individuals' disposable income, tax revenue, income inequality and other aspects of interest. These models do not take into account behavioral responses of people such as decreased labor supply induced by a tax hike. This is not problematic when, for example, a researcher is only interested in studying the effects of a marginal change in tax liability on overall inequality.

On the other hand, behavioral tax-benefit models account for behavioral responses of people to policy changes. As opposed to arithmetical models, these models basically simulate two periods:

# In the first period, the arithmetical calculation of first-order effects of a reform on individuals' disposable income is performed;
# Then, behavioral reactions of people to the reform enter the model, and the second-order effects of the reform are estimated.

=== Static vs. dynamic tax-benefit models ===
Static tax-benefit models provide an opportunity to study only "morning after" effects of a policy change. That is, only one period ahead is considered, so only immediate impact of a reform is estimated.

On the other hand, dynamic tax-benefit models aim at simulating the selected aspects of the economy over long periods of time. They utilize data on probabilistic characteristics of the underlying population to account for individuals' aging, changes in marital status, new children, etc. These models are used, for example, to study the long-run effects of a change in tax code related to the number of children in the family.

=== Summary ===
The four basic types of tax-benefit models with illustrative examples can be summarized by the table below:
{| class="wikitable" style="border: none; background: none;"
|+ Taxonomy of tax-benefit models with examples
|-
! 
! Arithmetic
! Behavioral
|-
! Static
|A small change in tax liability
|A significant change in tax liability
|-
! Dynamic
|A change in property tax
|A change in tax code related to the number of children in the family
|}

Dynamic behavioral tax-benefit models are closely related to [[agent-based model]]s, especially when the model also accounts for interactions between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Paul|date=2007|title=The role of the International Journal of Microsimulation|url=|journal=International Journal of Microsimulation|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related issues ==
=== Data preparation ===
Most of tax-benefit models heavily depend on the availability and accuracy of the underlying micro-data. As Holly Sutherland, the director of [[Euromod|EUROMOD]] and one of the most influential researchers in this area, points out, "any model would be as good as the data available to it".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;SUTHERLAND, Holly. Constructing a Tax-Benefit Model: What Advice Can One Give?. ''Review of Income'' [online]. 1991, '''37'''(2), 199-219 [cit. 2018-05-02]. ISSN 00346586.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax-benefit models assume that the data from surveys represent the population of interest. This assumption is not easy to satisfy. Not only the proportions of different families in the sample might not reflect the true proportions, but also there is a problem of coverage. That is, the census is likely to exclude such groups as armed forces, people in prisons, hospitals or nursing houses, people living abroad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some households may (intentionally or unintentionally) report less income than actually was received. Because static tax-benefit models are usually built under hypothesis that individuals report all their incomes, the results of the simulations may be inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourguignon|first=François|last2=Spadaro|first2=Amedeo|date=2006-04-01|title=Microsimulation as a tool for evaluating redistribution policies|journal=The Journal of Economic Inequality|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=77–106|doi=10.1007/s10888-005-9012-6|issn=1569-1721|citeseerx=10.1.1.639.3750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important that the underlying micro-data are up to date, so the surveys should be conducted frequently.

=== Computing power ===
Due to their complexity, tax-benefit models (especially behavioral or dynamic ones) usually require extensive [[computational resource]]s.

== Examples ==
There are many tax-benefit models all over the world. Below are some of the most prominent models:

After a [[Top five play-offs|top five play-off]] system was used, a play-off structure involving the top six teams was used to determine the winners of the [[Super League]] competition in [[United Kingdom|British]] [[rugby league]] from [[Super League VII|2002]] through to [[Super League XIII|2008]].

Apart from the [[Super League Grand Final|Grand Final]], all matches were staged at the home ground of the team placed higher in the final league table. A similar system was used by the [[National Soccer League|Australian National Soccer League]]. The [[A-League]] uses the same system to determine its champions, but with a subtle difference outlined below. 

From week two on the Top Six play-offs system reflects exactly the [[Page playoff system]].

With the [[2009–11 Super League licences|expansion of Super League]] from 12 teams to 14 for [[Super League XIV|2009]], the number of teams making the play-offs increased from 6 to 8. For details of the new system, see [[Super League play-offs]].

==How it worked==
[[File:Playoffs6.jpg|800px]]

'''Week One'''
* Elimination Semi-final A: 3rd vs 6th
* Elimination Semi-final B: 4th vs 5th

'''Week Two'''
* Qualification Final: 1st vs 2nd
* Elimination Final: Winners of Elimination Semi-final A vs Winners of Elimination Semi-final B

'''Week Three'''
* Preliminary Final: Losers of Qualification Match vs Winners of Elimination Final

'''Week Four'''
* [[Super League Grand Final|Grand Final]]: Winners of Qualification Match vs Winners of Final Qualifier

==The A-League system==
'''Week One'''
* Elimination final A: 3rd vs 6th
* Elimination final B: 4th vs 5th

'''Week Two'''
* Semi Final A: Highest-Ranked Elimination Final Winner vs 2nd
* Semi Final B: Lowest Ranked Elimination Final Winner vs 1st

'''Week Three'''
* [[A-League Grand Final|Grand Final]]: Winners of Semi Final A vs Winners of Semi Final B

==Competitions==
In addition to the Super League, the top six system is also used in the [[Co-operative Championship|Championship]] and the [[Championship One]], as well [[Rugby League Conference]] National.

A '''van der Corput sequence''' is an example of the simplest one-dimensional  [[low-discrepancy sequence]] over the [[unit interval]]; it was first described in 1935 by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] mathematician [[Johannes van der Corput|J. G. van der Corput]].  It is constructed by reversing the [[base (exponentiation)|base-''n'' representation]] of the sequence of [[natural number]]s (1, 2, 3, …).

The ''b''-ary representation of the positive integer ''n'' (≥ 1) is
:&lt;math&gt;
n=\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}d_k(n)b^k,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''b'' is the base in which the number ''n'' is represented, and 0 ≤ ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &lt; ''b'', i.e. the ''k''-th digit in the ''b''-ary expansion of ''n''.
The ''n''-th number in the van der Corput sequence is
:&lt;math&gt;
g_b(n)=\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}d_k(n)b^{-k-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
For example, to get the [[decimal]] van der Corput sequence, we start by dividing the numbers 1 to 9 in tenths (''x''/10), then we change the denominator to 100 to begin dividing in hundredths (''x''/100). In terms of numerator, we begin with all two-digit numbers from 10 to 99, but in '''backwards''' order of digits. Consequently, we will get the numerators grouped by the end digit. Firstly, all two-digit numerators that end with 1, so the next numerators are 01, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91. Then the numerators ending with 2, so they are 02, 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, 62, 72, 82, 92. An after the numerators ending in 3: 03, 13, 23 and so on...

Thus, the sequence begins

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \tfrac{1}{10}, \tfrac{2}{10}, \tfrac{3}{10}, \tfrac{4}{10}, \tfrac{5}{10}, \tfrac{6}{10}, \tfrac{7}{10}, \tfrac{8}{10}, \tfrac{9}{10}, \tfrac{1}{100}, \tfrac{11}{100}, \tfrac{21}{100}, \tfrac{31}{100}, \tfrac{41}{100}, \tfrac{51}{100}, \tfrac{61}{100}, \tfrac{71}{100}, \tfrac{81}{100}, \tfrac{91}{100}, \tfrac{2}{100}, \tfrac{12}{100}, \tfrac{22}{100}, \tfrac{32}{100}, \ldots \right\},&lt;/math&gt;

or in floating-point representation:

:0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.01, 0.11, 0.21, 0.31, 0.41, 0.51, 0.61, 0.71, 0.81, 0.91, 0.02, 0.12, 0.22, 0.32, …,

The same can be done for the [[binary numeral system]], and the binary van der Corput sequence is

:0.1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.01&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.11&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.001&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.011&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.0001&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.1001&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.0101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.1101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.0011&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.1011&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.0111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.1111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …

or, equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{4}, \tfrac{3}{4}, \tfrac{1}{8}, \tfrac{5}{8}, \tfrac{3}{8}, \tfrac{7}{8}, \tfrac{1}{16}, \tfrac{9}{16}, \tfrac{5}{16}, \tfrac{13}{16}, \tfrac{3}{16}, \tfrac{11}{16}, \tfrac{7}{16}, \tfrac{15}{16}, \ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

The elements of the van der Corput sequence (in any base) form a [[dense set]] in the unit interval; that is, for any real number in [0, 1], there exists a [[subsequence]] of the van der Corput sequence that [[limit of a sequence|converges]] to that number.  They are also [[equidistributed]] over the unit interval.

==Examples of usage==
  
The [[marketer]] Matt Bailey described it as "a desire to see something done, but not enough desire to make it happen".&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Matt Bailey, "Viral marketing", excerpt "Analytics 1.0 - A Case of Velleity," found at [http://www.sitelogicmarketing.com/blog/07-analytics-velleity Site Logic marketing website].  Accessed April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In modern writing===

Matt Bailey expressed an attempt "to bring it back, as it has more relevance now than ever."&lt;ref name=Bailey /&gt;  He writes that:
{{quote|Velleity is what keeps companies locked in this mindset of reporting useless numbers. Desiring, even expecting to someday have an epiphany of change, but not willing to change the mindset or the culture of locked-in reporting to achieve it. Nor are they willing to ask the hard questions in order to uncover what must be done.|Matt Bailey, marketing writer&lt;ref name=Bailey /&gt;}}

===In philosophy===

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] describes the velleity of an [[artist]] as a "desire to ''be'' 'what he is able to represent, conceive, and express'...."&lt;ref&gt;
Aaron Ridley, in "Nietzsche, philosophy and the arts," ed. by Salim Kemal, Ivan Gaskell, Daniel W. Conway, at pp. 128-131 (Cambridge University Press, 2002) {{ISBN|0-521-52272-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-52272-4}} (emphasis provided), found at [https://books.google.com/books?id=8GzFg3pH4SIC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;lpg=PA130&amp;dq=Velleity+%2B+philosophy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MljPsygceA&amp;sig=SWt2zXpiLVhU9oBymK3jfNIAKQs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TrH4SfCODNOGmQeOj-GYDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#PPA134,M1 Google Book search]. Accessed April 29, 2009.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Nietzsche championed the [[will to power]], which can be encapsulated{{by whom?|date=November 2012}} as starting with velleity, in his [[free-will theorem]].

Keith David Wyma refers frequently to the "concept of velleity", citing [[Thomas Aquinas]] as a pioneer of introducing the idea into philosophy.&lt;ref name=Wyma&gt;

He distinguishes between the two types of velleity - "''to do'' something and one ''not to do'' something...."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;  Furthermore, he asserts, "The concept of velleity is also important because it enables us to understand the co-existence of conflicting values."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;  A person could thus have "double velleity" or "a mix of velleity for something and a volition for its opposite: the latter dominates, of course, but that does not erase the fact of velleity."&lt;ref name=Sion /&gt;

'''Village Homes''' is a [[planned community]] in [[Davis, California|Davis]], [[Yolo County]], [[California]]. It is designed to be ecologically sustainable by harnessing the energies and natural resources that exists in the landscape, especially [[stormwater]] and [[solar energy]].

==History==
The principal designer of Village Homes was architect Mike Corbett who began planning in the 1960s, with construction continuing from south to north from the 1970s through the 1980s. Village Homes was completed in 1982, and has attracted international attention from its inception as an early model of an environmentally friendly housing development, including a visit from then-French President [[François Mitterrand]].&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.villagehomesdavis.org About Village Homes]; {{cite web |url=http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/vitalsigns/workup/siegel_house/vh_bkgd.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609124520/http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/vitalsigns/workup/siegel_house/vh_bkgd.html |archivedate=June 9, 2007 |df= }}; Smart Communities, [http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/success/village.shtml "Village Homes."]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817204157/http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/success/village.shtml |date=August 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability==
[[File:Grass lined channel NRCS.jpg|thumb|right|Grass lined swale collects rainwater, which then slowly percolates into the soil, where it is protected from runoff and evaporation.]]
The 225 homes and 20 apartment units that now are the Village Homes community use solar panels for heating, and they are oriented around common areas at the rear of the buildings, rather than around the street at the front. All streets are oriented east-west, with all lots positioned north-south. This feature has become standard practice in Davis and elsewhere since it enables homes with passive solar designs to make full use of the sun's energy throughout the year. The development also uses natural drainage, called bioswales, to collect water to irrigate the common areas and support the cultivation of edible foods, such as nut and fruit trees and vegetables for consumption by residents, without incurring the cost of using treated municipal water.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.villagehomesdavis.org Village Homes, Davis, California]; Bill Browning and Kim Hamilton, [http://www.context.org/iclib/ic35/browning/ "Village Homes: A model solar community proves its worth"]; Smart Communities, Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' deemed whataboutism, as used in Russia, "practically a national ideology".&lt;ref name=lukeharding /&gt; Journalist [[Julia Ioffe]] wrote that "Anyone who has ever studied the Soviet Union" was aware of the technique, citing the Soviet rejoinder to criticism, ''[[And you are lynching Negroes]]'', as a "classic" example of the tactic.&lt;ref name=juliaioffe /&gt; Writing for ''[[Bloomberg News]]'',

According to Russian journalist Konstantin von Eggert, the term originated in the 1960s as an ironic description of "the Soviet Union's efforts at countering Western criticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=von Eggert|first1=Konstantin|title=Due West: 'Whataboutism' Is Back – and Thriving|url=https://sputniknews.com/analysis/20120725174777687/|accessdate=14 January 2018|publisher=Sputnik International|date=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' dictionary dates the term back to the Cold War.&lt;ref name=webster&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/whataboutism-origin-meaning|title=What About 'Whataboutism?'|publisher=Merriam Webster|quote=The association of whataboutism with the Soviet Union began during the Cold War.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It references journalist Michael Bernard from ''[[The Age]]'', who in 1978 wrote "the weaknesses of whataboutism—which dictates that no one must get away with an attack on the Kremlin's abuses without tossing a few bricks at South Africa, no one must indict the Cuban police State without castigating President Park, no one must mention Irak, Libya or the PLO without having a bash at Israel".&lt;ref name=webster/&gt;

According to ''Oxford Dictionary of English'', in British English ''whataboutism'' is synonymous with ''whataboutery'',&lt;ref name=ODE/&gt; which according to Zimmer has been used with a similar meaning since the period of [[The Troubles]] conflict in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref name=zimmer2 /&gt; In 1974, a letter published in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' referred to "the Whatabouts ... who answer every condemnation of the Provisional I.R.A. with an argument to prove the greater immorality of the 'enemy{{'"}} and an opinion column in the same paper picked up the theme using the term "whataboutery", which gained wide currency in commentary about the conflict.&lt;ref name=zimmer2 /&gt; Zimmer noted that the variant ''whataboutism'' was used in the same context in a 1993 book by [[Tony Parker (author)|Tony Parker]].&lt;ref name=zimmer2 /&gt;

The philosopher Merold Westphal said that only people who know themselves to be guilty of something "can find comfort in finding others to be just as bad or worse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Westphal|first1=Merold|title=God, Guilt, and Death: An Existential Phenomenology of Religion|date=1987|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Ind|isbn=0-253-20417-8|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whataboutery, as practiced by both parties in [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland to highlight what the other side had done to them, was "one of the commonest forms of evasion of personal moral responsibility," according to Bishop (later Cardinal) [[Cahal Daly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/roddy_evans/evans_02_breath.pdf#page=49|author=The Right Reverend John Austin Baker|date=January 1982|title=Ireland and Northern Ireland|journal=[[The Furrow]]|volume=33|issue=1|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a [[2017 Congressional baseball shooting|political shooting at a baseball game in 2017]], journalist [[Chuck Todd]] criticized the tenor of political debate, commenting, "What-about-ism is among the worst instincts of partisans on both sides."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|access-date=5 July 2017|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chuck-todd-gop-congressmen-shooting_us_5941e58ae4b0d3185486f3a6|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=14 June 2017|title=MSNBC's Chuck Todd Calls Out Partisan 'Toxic Stew' After Shooter Targets Congressmen|first=Ed|last=Mazza}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|access-date=5 July 2017|first=Chuck|last=Todd|authorlink=Chuck Todd|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zQhH72bW_A|title=Chuck Todd: The Media Has 'A Role To Play' In Calling Out Caustic Rhetoric |work=[[Meet the Press]] |agency=[[MSNBC]]|date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intentionally discrediting oneself===
Whataboutism usually points the finger at a rival's offenses to discredit them, but, in a reversal of this usual direction, it can also be used to discredit oneself while one refuses to critique an ally. During the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. presidential campaign]], when ''[[The New York Times]]'' asked candidate Donald Trump about Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]'s treatment of journalists, teachers, and dissidents, Trump replied with a criticism of U.S. history on civil liberties.&lt;ref name=catherineputz&gt;{{cite news|last1=Putz|first1=Catherine|title=Donald Trump's Whataboutism|url=http://thediplomat.com/2016/07/donald-trumps-whataboutism/|accessdate=20 May 2017|work=[[The Diplomat]]|date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Diplomat]]'', Catherine Putz pointed out: "The core problem is that this rhetorical device precludes discussion of issues (ex: civil rights) by one country (ex: the United States) if that state lacks a perfect record."&lt;ref name=catherineputz /&gt; [[Masha Gessen]] wrote for ''The New York Times'' that usage of the tactic by Trump was shocking to Americans, commenting, "No American politician in living memory has advanced the idea that the entire world, including the United States, was rotten to the core."&lt;ref name=mashagessen&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Masha Gessen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/opinion/sunday/in-praise-of-hypocrisy.html|first=Masha|last=Gessen|access-date=5 July 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=In Praise of Hypocrisy|date=18 February 2017|quote=This stance has breathed new life into the old Soviet propaganda tool of 'whataboutism', the trick of turning any argument against the opponent.

This month, Mr. Trump employed the technique of whataboutism when he was asked about his admiration for Mr. Putin, whom the host Bill O'Reilly called 'a killer'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns about effects===
Joe Austin was critical of the practice of whataboutism in Northern Ireland in a 1994 piece, ''The Obdurate and the Obstinate'', writing: "And I'd no time at all for 'What aboutism' ... if you got into it you were defending the indefensible."&lt;ref name=austin&gt;{{cite book|year=1994|first=Joe|last=Austin|chapter=The Obdurate and the Obstinate|editor1-first=Tony|editor1-last= Parker|editor1link=Tony Parker (author)|title=May the Lord in His Mercy be Kind to Belfast|publisher=[[Henry Holt and Company]]|isbn=978-0805030532|page=136|quote=And I'd no time at all for 'What aboutism' – you know, people who said 'Yes, but what about what's been done to us? ...

When Soviet leaders were questioned about human rights violations, for example, they might come back with, 'Well, what about the Negroes you are lynching in the South?' That's not an argument, of course. It is a deflection to an entirely different issue. It's a naked attempt to excuse your own wretched behavior by painting your opponent as a hypocrite. But in the fast-paced world of media manipulation, the Soviet leader could get away with it merely by appearing to be strong and firm in defense of his country.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[National Review]]'', commentator [[Ben Shapiro]] criticized the practice, whether it was used by those espousing [[right-wing politics]] or [[left-wing politics]]; Shapiro concluded: "It's all dumb.

Koplow of [[Israel Policy Forum]] wrote that the usage of whataboutism had become a crisis; concluding that the tactic did not yield any benefits, Koplow charged that "whataboutism from either the right or the left only leads to a black hole of angry recriminations from which nothing will escape".&lt;ref name=koplow&gt;{{citation|first=Michael J.|last=Koplow|work=Matzav|agency=[[Israel Policy Forum]]|date=6 July 2017|access-date=6 July 2017|url=http://www.matzavblog.com/2017/07/the-crisis-of-whataboutism/|title=The crisis of whataboutism|quote=whataboutism from either the right or the left only leads to a black hole of angry recriminations from which nothing will escape.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Some commentators have defended the usage of whataboutism and ''tu quoque'' in certain contexts. Whataboutism can provide necessary context into whether or not a particular line of critique is relevant or fair. For instance, in international relations, behavior that may be imperfect by international standards may be quite good for a given geopolitical neighborhood, and deserves to be recognized as such.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Christian Christensen, Professor of Journalism in Stockholm, argues that the accusation of whataboutism is itself a form of ''tu quoque'' fallacy, as it dismisses criticisms of one's own behavior to focus instead on the actions of another, thus creating a double standard. Those who use whataboutism are not necessarily engaging in an empty or cynical deflection of responsibility: whataboutism can be a useful tool to expose contradictions, double standards, and hypocrisy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/1/whataboutism-charlie-hebdo-king-abdullah.html|title=We need ‘whataboutism’ now more than ever|last=Christensen|first=Christian|date=January 26, 2015|website=Al-Jazeera English|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/opinion/one-cheer-for-whataboutism.html|title=One Cheer for Whataboutism|last=Yagoda|first=Ben|date=July 19, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 17, 2018|quote=Tu quoque is a subset of the so-called ad hominem argument: a strike against the character, not the position, of one’s opponent. Ad hominem gets a bad press, but it isn’t without merit, when used in good faith. It’s useful in an argument to show that the stance being taken against you is inconsistent or hypocritical. It doesn’t win the day, but it chips away at your opponent’s moral standing and raises doubt about the entirety of his or her position.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have criticized the usage of accusations of whataboutism by American news outlets, arguing that the accusation whataboutism has been used to simply deflect any and all criticism of human rights abuses perpetrated by the United States or its allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.1news.az/news/ritorika-holodnoy-voyny-na-fone-narusheniya-prav-cheloveka-v-ssha|title=Риторика холодной войны на фоне нарушения прав человека в США|last=|first=|date=August 26, 2014|work=1News Azerbaijan|access-date=August 16, 2018|language=Russian|trans-title=Cold War rhetoric against a backdrop of human rights violations in the USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the usage of the term almost exclusively by American outlets is a double standard,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2013/03/06/saudi-arabia-russia-the-magnitsky-act-and-whataboutism/|title=Saudi Arabia, Russia, The Magnitsky Act, And 'Whataboutism'|last=Mark|first=Adomanis|date=March 6, 2013|work=Forbes|access-date=16 August 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829051034/https://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2013/03/06/saudi-arabia-russia-the-magnitsky-act-and-whataboutism/|archivedate=29 October 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that moral accusations made by powerful countries are merely a pretext to punish their geopolitical rivals in the face of their own wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.1news.az/news/ritorika-holodnoy-voyny-na-fone-narusheniya-prav-cheloveka-v-ssha|title=Риторика холодной войны на фоне нарушения прав человека в США|last=|first=|date=August 26, 2014|website=1 News Azerbaijan|language=Russian|trans-title=Cold War rhetoric against a backdrop of human rights abuses in the USA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 16, 2018|quote=«Права человека – это дубинка в руках сильных мира сего, которую они используют, когда кто-то вокруг проявляет непослушание», - убежден азербайджанский политический деятель Араз Ализаде, возглавляющий Социал-демократическую партию Азербайджана.

The scholars [[Kristen R. Ghodsee]] and [[Scott Sehon]] posit that mentioning the possible existence of victims of capitalism in popular discourse is often dismissed as 'whataboutism', which they describe as "a term implying that only atrocities perpetrated by communists merit attention." They also argue that such accusations of 'whataboutism' are invalid as the same arguments used against communism can also be used against capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aeon.co/essays/the-merits-of-taking-an-anti-anti-communism-stance|title=Anti-anti-communism|last1= Ghodsee|first1=Kristen R.|last2= Sehon|first2=Scott|date= March 22, 2018|website=[[Aeon (digital magazine)|Aeon]]|publisher= |access-date=October 1, 2018|quote="But the problem for the anti-communists is that their general premise can be used as the basis for an equally good argument against capitalism, an argument that the so-called losers of economic transition in eastern Europe would be quick to affirm. The US, a country based on a free-market capitalist ideology, has done many horrible things: the enslavement of millions of Africans, the genocidal eradication of the Native Americans, the brutal military actions taken to support pro-Western dictatorships, just to name a few. The British Empire likewise had a great deal of blood on its hands: we might merely mention the internment camps during the second Boer War and the Bengal famine. This is not mere ‘whataboutism’, because the same intermediate premise necessary to make their anti-communist argument now works against capitalism: Historical point: the US and the UK were based on a capitalist ideology, and did many horrible things. General premise: if any country based on a particular ideology did many horrible things, then that ideology should be rejected. Political conclusion: capitalism should be rejected."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
