'''Aerial perspective''' or '''atmospheric perspective''' refers to the effect the atmosphere has on the appearance of an object as it is viewed from a distance. As the distance between an object and a viewer increases, the [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between the object and its background decreases, and the contrast of any markings or details within the object also decreases. The colours of the object also become less [[saturation (color theory)|saturated]] and shift towards the background colour, which is usually blue, but under some conditions may be some other colour (for example, at sunrise or sunset distant colours may shift towards red).

==History==

Aerial perspective was used in paintings from the Netherlands in the 15th century, and explanations of its effects were with varying degrees of accuracy written by [[polymath]]s such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The latter used aerial perspective in many of his paintings such as the [[Mona Lisa]] and [[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]. Atmospheric perspective was used in Pompeian Second Style paintings, one of the [[Pompeian Styles]], dating as early as 30 BCE. A notable example is the Gardenscape from the Villa of Livia in Primaporta, Italy.

==Optics==

The major component affecting the appearance of objects during [[daylight]] is [[scattering]] of light, called [[Diffuse sky radiation|skylight]], into the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] of the viewer. Scattering occurs from molecules of the air and also from larger particles in the atmosphere such as water vapour and smoke (see [[haze]]). Scattering adds the sky light as a [[veiling luminance]] onto the light from the object, reducing its contrast with the background sky light. Skylight usually contains more light of short [[wavelength]] than other wavelengths (this is why the sky usually appears blue), which is why distant objects appear bluish (see [[Rayleigh scattering]] for detailed explanation). A minor component is scattering of light out of the line of sight of the viewer. Under daylight, this either augments the contrast loss (e.g., for white objects) or opposes it (for dark objects). At night there is effectively no skylight (unless the [[moon]] is very bright), so scattering out of the line of sight becomes the major component affecting the appearance of [[self-luminous]] objects. Such objects have their contrasts reduced with the dark background, and their colours are shifted towards red.

==Why reducing contrast reduces clarity==

The ability of a person with normal [[visual acuity]] to see fine details is determined by his or her [[contrast sensitivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, D. H. (1977). Visual contrast sensitivity. Optica Acta, 24, 107-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrast sensitivity is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the smallest contrast for which a person can [[Contrast (vision)|see]] a sine-wave [[grating]]. A person's [[contrast sensitivity function]] is contrast sensitivity as a function of [[spatial frequency]]. Normally, peak contrast sensitivity is at about 4 cycles per degree of [[visual angle]]. At higher spatial frequencies, comprising finer and finer lines, contrast sensitivity decreases, until at about 40 cycles per degree even the brightest of bright lines and the darkest of dark lines cannot be seen.

The high spatial frequencies in an image give it its fine details.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, R., &amp; Sekuler, R. (2006). Perception (5th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing the contrast of an image reduces the visibility of these high spatial frequencies because contrast sensitivity for them is already poor. This is how a reduction of contrast can reduce the clarity of an image—by removing its fine details.

It is important to emphasize that reducing the contrast is not the same as [[Focus (optics)|blurring]] an image. Blurring is accomplished by reducing the contrast only of the high spatial frequencies. Aerial perspective reduces the contrast of all spatial frequencies.

==In art==

In art, especially painting, ''aerial perspective''  refers to the technique of creating an illusion of depth by depicting distant objects as paler, less detailed, and usually bluer than near objects.

[[File:Frans Koppelaar - Backlight Langestraat.jpg|thumb|[[Frans Koppelaar]], Backlight Langestraat|left]]
(One caution: in common speech, the words ''perspective'' and ''viewpoint'' tend to be used interchangeably; however, in art, aerial perspective does not imply an [[aerial viewpoint]], such as that forming the basis of the [[aerial landscape]] genre. The example by [[Frans Koppelaar]] pictured here shows the difference. This landscape is a good example of aerial perspective; however, it is not an aerial landscape, since the observer is apparently standing on the ground.)

An '''arcosolium''', plural '''arcosolia''', is an arched recess used as a place of entombment. The word is from Latin ''arcus'', "arch", and ''solium'', "throne" (literally: "place of state") or post-classical "[[sarcophagus]]".{{dubious|What is it supposed to mean, "place of state"? And what is the connection to "sarcophagus? Mess...|date=August 2018}}

Early arcosolia were [[cut from the living rock|carved out of the living rock]] in [[catacomb]]s. In the very earliest of these, the arched recess was cut to ground level. Then a low wall would be built in the front, leaving a trough (the ''cubiculum'', "chamber") in which to place the body. A flat stone slab would then cover the chamber containing the body, thus sealing it. The stone slab occasionally also served as an altar, especially for Christians, who celebrated Mass on them. In the later arcosolia, the arched recess was carved out to about waist height. Then the masons cut downwards to make the chamber into which the corpse would be placed. In effect, the trough was then a sarcophagus with living rock on five of its six faces. As before, a flat stone slab would then seal the ''cubiculum''. 

From the 13th century onwards, and continuing into the [[Renaissance]], arcosolia were built above ground, particularly in the walls of churches. In these post-Roman era recesses, which were built of brick and marble, the sarcophagi are usually separate from the arch. These tombs are highly ornamented in the styles of those periods;&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F. L. (ed.) (1957) ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. Oxford U. P.; p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Flamboyant|Flamboyant Gothic]], [[Plateresque]], and [[High Renaissance]] styles are all represented.

The '''Armenian cochineal''' (''Porphyrophora hamelii'' &lt;small&gt;(Brandt)&lt;/small&gt;), also known as the '''Ararat cochineal''' or '''Ararat scale''', is a [[scale insect]] indigenous to the [[Ararat plain]] and [[Aras River|Aras (Araks) River valley]] in the [[Armenian Highlands]].

Around the end of the 16th century the [[Old World]] ''Porphyrophora'' dyes were supplanted by dyes of the [[cochineal|''Dactylopius coccus'' cochineal]] species from the Americas, which could be harvested several times per year and yielded a much more concentrated dye.&lt;ref name=Phipps_2010 /&gt;

The [[carmine]] dyestuff of ''Porphyrophora hamelii'' owes its red color almost entirely to [[carminic acid]], making it difficult to distinguish chemically from the dyestuff of [[cochineal]] from the Americas.&lt;ref name="Cardon_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson_1969" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bohmer_and_Thompson_1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Phipps_2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wouters_and_Verhecken_1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wouters |first=Jan |last2=Verhecken |first2=André |date=1989 |title=The Coccid Insect Dyes: HPLC and Computerized Diode-Array Analysis of Dyed Yarns |jstor=1506286 |journal=Studies in Conservation |publisher=Maney Publishing |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=189–200 |doi=10.1179/sic.1989.34.4.189}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 October 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The dyestuff of ''Porphyrophora polonica'' can be distinguished by its small admixture of kermesic acid, which is the major constituent of [[Kermes (dye)|kermes]] from ''Kermes vermilio''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1531">'''The Art Museum Partnership''' (2005&amp;ndash;2012) was a [[New York City]]-based [[non-profit organization]] that provided the nonprofit [[art museum]]s with educational opportunities that facilitate the sharing of information, resources, and collections. The Partnership was primarily established to benefit the small to medium-sized museums that comprise the largest segment in the field. However, larger museums were encouraged to participate, since the challenges in the field are universal and all participants benefit from the knowledge of their peers. The Art Museum Partnership was open to the leaders of all nonprofit art institutions regardless of size or focus.

'''The Directors Forum''' was the signature program of the Art Museum Partnership. The two-and-a-half-day annual conference for museum directors featured panel discussions with some of the most distinguished professionals in the art world. It was held October at renowned museums and cultural institutions in New York City. The goal of this annual conference was to engage museum leaders throughout the nation in an exchange of views on issues of mutual concern.

The [[culture of Tunisia]] is thousands of years old, but the 2011 [[Tunisian revolution]] brought about important changes to the way art and politics interact in [[Tunisia]]. Censorship under the dictatorship of former president [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] was replaced with unprecedented freedom of expression and questions on how to use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rhodes|first=Emile|title=La culture tunisienne fait sa révolution|url=http://www.slateafrique.com/1763/culture-tunisienne-fait-revolution|accessdate=20 April 2013|newspaper=Slate Afrique|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The newfound vigorousness of the arts in Tunisia and the new challenges artists have to address echo those in other countries affected by the [[Arab Spring]], especially [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Demerdash|first=Nancy|title=Consuming Revolution: Ethics, Art, and Ambivalence in the Arab Spring|url=http://www.brismes.ac.uk/nmes/consuming-revolutionethics-art-and-ambivalence-in-the-arab-spring#1|publisher=British Society for Middle Eastern Studies|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Art before the Tunisian revolution===

Artists found ways to circumvent or avoid censorship of their work before the downfall of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rhodes|first=Emile|title=Quand les artistes se jouaient de Ben Ali|url=http://www.slateafrique.com/1665/les-arts-pour-contourner-censure-ben-ali|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=Slate Afrique|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tunisian collaborative painting]], for instance, is an art form created in Tunisia during the 1980s that allows several artists to collaborate on one piece without prior discussion or planning. Although the Tunisian art market was relatively small and inward looking compared to the ones in other North African countries like [[Morocco]] or [[Algeria]], there was proof of an evolving, dynamic art scene even before the revolution, with the successes of [http://galerie-elmarsa.com/ang/index.html Galerie El Marsa] or [http://www.leviolonbleu.com/ Le Violon Bleu].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ben Soltane|first=Mohamed|title=Art in Tunisia: a visibility in the making|date=14 September 2010|url=https://www.academia.edu/617582/Art_in_Tunisia_A_visibility_in_the_making|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, according to Khadija Hamdi: "In Tunisia, with the absence, among other things, of a cultural policy specific to the art market, and the lack of the appropriate cultural and ideological conditions, the emergence of a "system" of "contemporary art" itself (in the Western sense) has not yet been possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamdi|first=Khadija|title=On the path of contemporary Tunisian art|url=http://www.ismailbahri.lautre.net/files/on-the-path-of-tunisian-art-en-2011.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain artistic institutions such as the school of music in [[El Kef]] were closed by the regime as potential hotbeds of discord.

===Art during and after the Tunisian revolution===

Works of art that used the revolution as a subject proliferated after the downfall of the former regime, both to emulate iconic revolutionary symbols and to explore the complex challenges the country still faced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shilton|first=Siobhán|title=Art and the ‘Arab Spring’: Aesthetics of revolution in contemporary Tunisia|journal=French Cultural Studies|date=29 January 2013|volume=24|issue=1|pages=129–145|doi=10.1177/0957155812464166|url=http://frc.sagepub.com/content/24/1/129|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolution saw an upshot in the number of artistic manifestations such as exhibits, most notably in the field of [[photography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Triki|first=Rachida|title=Tunisia: A Dynamic and Vigilant Art Scene|url=http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/nafas/articles/2012/tunisia_art_scene|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Nafas Art Magazine|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other art forms such as music also thrived after the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kraft|first=Jessica C.|title=After the revolution, arts bloom in Tunisia|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Music/2012/0209/After-the-revolution-arts-bloom-in-Tunisia|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remnants from the older regime and from the demonstrations themselves were also used by artists during the revolution, by transforming a police station into an art gallery or transforming burnt out cars into works of art, for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Metwaly|first=Ati|title=Police station in Tunisia turned into an art gallery|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/35/20023/Arts--Culture/Stage--Street/Police-station-in-Tunisia-turned-into-an-art-galle.aspx|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Ahram Online|date=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ben Miled|first=Zied|title=Burnt out cars turned into artistic pieces in Tunisian revolution|url=http://www.demotix.com/news/1580613/burnt-out-cars-turned-artistic-pieces-tunisian-revolution#media-1580588|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Demotix|date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villas belonging to the Trabelsis, the family of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's wife [[Leïla Ben Ali]], became the target of graffiti artists soon after the regime's downfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Les graffeurs tunisiens s'invitent dans les villas Trabelsi|url=http://www.slateafrique.com/8285/des-graffeurs-tunisiens-tagguent-les-villas-des-trabelsi|accessdate=20 April 2013|newspaper=Slate Afrique|date=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Street art====

In the months during and following the revolution, [[street art]] played a major role by reclaiming public spaces that used to be controlled by the government and by letting artists and ordinary citizens express themselves freely for the first time in years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Galliot|first=Lorena|title=Graffiti artists show their support for the Tunisian revolution|url=http://observers.france24.com/content/20110606-graffiti-artists-show-support-tunisian-revolution|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=France 24|date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual artists or groups like the student-run Ahl El Kahf collective used stencils, graffitis and paintings to depict political or revolutionary themes, such as the portrait of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Galliot|first=Lorena|title=Graffiti artists show their support for the Tunisian revolution|url=http://observers.france24.com/content/20110606-graffiti-artists-show-support-tunisian-revolution|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=France 24|date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to using local revolutionary symbols, street artists also reused Western and Latin American revolutionary icons in the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rodrigues|first=Jill|title=Revolutionary Art on the Streets of Tunisia|url=http://pdq.rwu.edu/news/revolutionary-art-streets-tunisia|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Roger Williams University|date=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murals were one of the most common form of street art, representing, for instance, people killed during the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Letsinger|first=Brandon|title=Creating the Political: Street Art after the Tunisia Revolution|url=http://letsingerwrites.com/2011/10/29/creating-the-political-art-after-revolution-part-1/|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nicholas Korody, "The graffiti of the Tunisian revolution always possesses a revolutionary character in form. That is to say, it existed as a reappropriation of authoritarian-controlled property. It is also notable in that it is the only art form born out of the revolution. While a few artists existed in Tunisia during the Ben Ali regime, their work was quickly covered up and few people knew about the art form. Since the revolution, it has grown massively."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Korody|first=Nicholas|title=The Revolutionary Art: Street Art Before and After the Tunisian Revolution|journal=Independent Study Project|date=7 December 2011|url=http://digitalcollections.sit.edu/isp_collection/1134|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Academic Response'''

The revolution in Tunisia and its aftermath has prompted much discussion. Tunisian intellectual, Dr. Mohamed-Salah Omri, a fellow at University of Oxford in Modern Arabic literature, has dedicated much of his research to examining the intersections between [https://www.academia.edu/5200885/A_Revolution_of_Dignity_and_Poetry poetry and revolution], the [https://www.academia.edu/30462852/Confluency_tarafud_between_trade_unionism_culture_and_revolution_in_Tunisia "Confluency"] between Culture, Revolution and [https://www.academia.edu/5208539/Trade_Unions_and_the_construction_of_a_specifically_Tunisian_protest_configuration Trade Unionism in Tunisia],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Omri|first=Mohamed-Salah|title=Trade Unions and the construction of a specifically Tunisian protest configuration|url=https://www.academia.edu/5208539/Trade_Unions_and_the_construction_of_a_specifically_Tunisian_protest_configuration|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the overall challenges of [https://www.academia.edu/9808087/Tunisias_revolution_of_dignity_and_freedom_cannot_be_colour-codedhttp_www.tni.org_article_tunisia-revolution-dignity-and-freedom-can-not-be-colour-coded the democratic transition in the country].

==New challenges==

===Religious challenges to artistic freedom===

Despite the end of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's dictatorship, Tunisian artists have faced new challenges to their artistic freedom, often from groups that have a strict interpretation of [[Islam]]. After years of censorship and repression of both the art world and religious identity, the new regime has had to juggle between the two, and tensions have periodically surfaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tunisian artists use graffiti to fight religious extremism|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/09/07/236596.html|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012 riots erupted against the "Printemps des Arts" exhibit in [[La Marsa]] that [[Salafi]] groups and others deemed blasphemous, most notably because of one work of art that spelled out [[God]]'s name using insects. Hundreds were arrested and curfews were imposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amara|first=Tarek|title=Islamists riot over "insulting" art|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/06/12/uk-tunisia-salafis-clash-idUKBRE85B0XP20120612|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=12 June 2012|author2=Lin Noueihed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some radical religious leaders called for the deaths of the artists, who received death threats, and Tunisian minister of culture [[Mehdi Mabrouk]] condemned the artists by saying that art should be "beautiful," not "revolutionary," and that the artists were wrong to invoke Islamic imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Larkins|first=Zoe|title=Under New Regime, Tunisian Artists Face New Censorship|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-opinion/news/2012-06-26/tunisia-censorship/|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Art in America|date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of the ruling [[Ennahda Movement]], [[Rachid Ghannouchi]], said that he condemned violence against individuals or property but also opposed "attacks on the beliefs of Tunisians" and emphasized the need to protect "sacred symbols".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Yasmine|title=Tunisia's embattled artists speak out|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/06/2012615111819112421.html|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also deemed blasphemous by some was a work of art by Nadia Jelassi, who created an installation of female mannequin busts, cloaked in [[hijab]]s and surrounded by stones.

Religious hardliners tried and sometimes succeeded to prevent other artistic events from taking place like music festivals and plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Amara|first=Tarek|title=Tunisian artists cry for help against religious extremists|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/19/us-tunisia-salafi-art-idUSBRE88I0SM20120919|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women artists in particular feared that hardline Muslim pressure would prevent them from working freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dettmer|first=Jamie|title=Tunisia's Female Artists Fear Islamist Repression|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/tunisia-female-artist-fear-islamist-repression/1617944.html|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Voice of America|date=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These tensions led many to feel that "nothing had changed" with regards to the relations between art and politics, as censorship is said to have shifted from being political to being religious and moral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jurich|first=Joscelyn|title=Revolution Hasn’t Changed Artistic Censorship in Tunisia|url=http://hyperallergic.com/63757/revolution-hasnt-changed-artistic-censorship-in-tunisia/|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Hyperallergic|date=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Sofiane Ouissi, co-creative director of the Dream City, an art festival that takes place in Tunis' medina: "Under the old censorship and oppression - it was conspicuous; we could locate it; it was clear for us. [...] But now, since it was displaced, it has come into the public space, you never know where dictatorship is going to emerge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fordham|first=Alice|title=The battle for Tunisia's art and soul|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/africa/the-battle-for-tunisias-art-and-soul#full|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=The National|date=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political challenges to artistic freedom===

Artists have also been targeted by the new regime. In November 2012, Chahine Berriche and Oussama Bouagila, two Tunisian graffiti artists, were arrested for writing "the people want rights for the poor" and "the poor are the living-dead in Tunisia" on the wall of a university. The two artists were members of the Zwelwa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hendoud |first=Henda |title=Tunisie – Zwewla, le graffiti se révolte |url=http://blog.slateafrique.com/tawa-fi-tunis/2012/11/19/tunisie-%E2%80%93-zewla-le-graffiti-se-revolte/ |accessdate=20 April 2013 |newspaper=Slate Afrique |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122053405/http://blog.slateafrique.com/tawa-fi-tunis/2012/11/19/tunisie-%E2%80%93-zewla-le-graffiti-se-revolte/ |archivedate=22 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  art activist collective and were charged with breaching the state of emergency, writing on public property and disturbing public order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ajmi|first=Sana|title=Tunisian graffiti artists targeted by law|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/sana-ajmi/tunisian-graffiti-artists-targeted-by-law|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Open Democracy|date=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempts to address challenges===

Tunisian street artists [[eL Seed]] reacted to these tensions between the artistic and religious communities by painting verses of the [[Quran]] preaching tolerance onto the Jara [[mosque]] in his hometown of [[Gabès]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Catriona|title=Tunisian artist graffitis minaret, fights intolerance|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/19/world/meast/el-seed-grafitti-minaret|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also said that the threat of censorship was exaggerated in certain circles: "I feel that there is a lot of hypocrisy in Tunisia at the moment, and unfortunately many artists relish censorship, or the fear of it, if it brings them international recognition. I personally have not felt any real threats of censorship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rao|first=Mallika|title=El Seed On Graffiti, Censorship In Tunisia, And Why Arabic Is An Artist's Best Friend|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/27/el-seed-tunisian-graffiti-artist_n_1918493.html|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New art institutions and organizations==

The [http://www.bchirartcenter.com/ B’chira Art Center], located near [[Sidi Thabet]] between [[Tunis]] and [[Bizerte]], opened in July 2011. The center aimed to develop contemporary art by providing a space for artists to produce and show work, as well as an experimental laboratory to research techniques and introduce children to the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ben Zineb |first=Sayda |title=Un lieu où se développent les pratiques artistiques contemporaines |url=http://www.letemps.com.tn/article-57952.html |accessdate=19 April 2013 |newspaper=Le Temps |date=31 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801091812/http://www.letemps.com.tn/article-57952.html |archivedate=1 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Carthage National Museum]] saw the launch of an umbrella program called [http://www.carthagecontemporary.com/ Carthage Contemporary], part of an increasingly dynamic contemporary art scene in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Milliard|first=Coline|title=From the Ashes of Tunisia's Revolution, A Contemporary Art Scene Grows: A Q&amp;A With Curator Khadija Hamdi|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/805447/from-the-ashes-of-tunisias-revolution-a-contemporary-art-scene-grows-a-qa-with-curator-khadija-hamdi|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Artinfo UK|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also established after the revolution in 2011 was the Tunisian Federation of the Visual Arts (Fédération Tunisienne des Arts Plastiques), a grouping of young artist associations aimed at defending and promoting visual arts in Tunisia. These goals are shared by two preexisting organizations, the Association of Tunisian Visual Artists (Union des Artistes Plasticiens Tunisiens) and the Union of Visual Arts Professions (Syndicat des Métiers des Arts Plastiques), created in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Triki|first=Rachida|title=Tunisia: A Dynamic and Vigilant Art Scene|url=http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/nafas/articles/2012/tunisia_art_scene|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Nafas Art Magazine|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International influences and projects==

===In Tunisia===

French street artist and photographer [[JR (artist)|JR]] launched the first phase of his [[Inside Out Project]] in Tunisia, where native photographers displayed large scale portraits of ordinary Tunisians around the country instead of the formerly ubiquitous pictures of the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artocracy in Tunisia|url=http://www.jr-art.net/projects/artocracy-in-tunisia|publisher=JR|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project fostered discussion with Tunisians, some of whom understood and appreciated the project, while others did not think art should play a political role by using public spaces and complained that the previous regime already imposed pictures upon them all the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Yasmine|title=Art challenges Tunisian revolutionaries|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/03/201132223217876176.html|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bell|first=Melissa|title=Tunisia and the art revolution|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/tunisia-and-the-art-revolution/2011/03/25/AFhnT5WB_blog.html|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algerian-French artist ZOO Project also celebrated the revolution by placing hundreds of life-size figures around the city, representing the Tunisians who revolted and in particular those who died during the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Eugene|last=Kim|title=Revolutionary Tunisian Street Art|url=http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/revolutionary-tunisian-street|publisher=My Modern Met|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abroad===

Tunisian artists also explored political and revolutionary themes in exhibits abroad. In France, the [[Institut du Monde Arabe]] hosted two events. In May 2011, an exhibit called "Dégage" (French for "get lost") showcased photographs of the revolution by a Tunisian photography collective of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="DÉGAGE", COLLECTIF DE PHOTOGRAPHES TUNISIENS|url=http://www.imarabe.org/exposition-ima-degage#|publisher=Institut du Monde Arabe|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Farhat|first=Mehdi|title=Le collectif Dégage révèle sa révolution|url=http://www.slateafrique.com/2203/collectif-degage-revele-revolution|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Slate Afrique|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second exhibit that ran from January to April 2012 called "Dégagements – Tunisia One Year On"  showed work from Tunisian artists and others from the Middle East to celebrate the anniversary of the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DÉGAGEMENTS...

In the United States, Tunisian student Ikram Lakhdhar curated an exhibit at Connecticut College called "Moments of Freedom: Revolutionary Art from China, South Africa and Tunisia" in April 2013 with work by contemporary Tunisian photographers Wassim Grimen, Omar Sfayhi, and Youssef Ben Ammar and internationally renown artists such as [[Diane Victor]], [[Zhang Hongtu]], [[Rajaa Gharbi]] and [[William Kentridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  news|last=Smadhi|first=Asma|title=Tunisian Student Organizes Revolutionary Art Exhibit in US|url=http://www.tunisia-live.net/2013/04/02/tunisian-student-organizes-revolutionary-art-exhibit-in-us/|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Tunisia Live|date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]], the ifa Gallery in [[Stuttgart]] hosted an exhibit from January to March 2013 called "Rosy Future" on the future of contemporary art in Tunisia after the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ROSY FUTURE – CONTEMPORARY ART FROM TUNISIA |url=http://www.contemporaryand.com/blog/exhibition/rosy-future-contemporary-art-from-tunisia/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130628223624/http://www.contemporaryand.com/blog/exhibition/rosy-future-contemporary-art-from-tunisia/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 June 2013 |publisher=Contemporary &amp; |accessdate=19 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ashanti English Medieval Ewer.jpg|thumb|Asante Ewer, British Museum, 62.3 cm high (including lid)]]

The '''Asante Ewer''' or '''Asante Jug''' is a leaded [[bronze]] lidded jug dated to the 1390s.  It is a rare surviving example of an English bronze jug from the 14th century, with great significance for the study of bronze working in medieval England.  It was taken from [[Kumasi]] in [[Ashanti Empire|Asante]] (now [[Ghana]]) during the [[Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War]] in 1895, and since 1896 has been held by the [[British Museum]] in London.

The front of the Asante Jug is decorated with the [[Royal Arms of England]] from the late 14th century, surmounted by a crown, with two lion [[supporters]].  Above three lines of lettering in a [[Lombardic capitals|Lombardic script]], within a moulded band, read from the bottom: 
: "+ HE THAT WYL NOT SPARE WHEN HE MAY HE SHALL NOT / SPEND WHEN HE WOULD DEME THE BEST IN EVERY / DOWT TIL THE TROWTHE BE TRYID OWTE"
The inscription appears to be two English sentences, run together:
: "He that will not spare when he may he shall not spend when he would" and "Deem the best in every doubt until the truth be tried out".

The neck of the Asante Jug bears six [[roundel]]s, three on either side, each with a falcon spreading its wings, with one to each side of the spout and two either side of the handle.  On the lip are three lions facing left, and a stag in a circle facing right.  The seven-sided lid of the jug is original, decorated with a lion above a stag [[couchant]] in each segment.  The handle ends with a scrolled [[quatrefoil]].

Without the lid, the jug is {{convert|43.3|cm}} high, and the lid (including the overlapping underlip) is {{convert|19.6|cm}}.  When assembled with its lid, the jug is {{convert|62.3|cm}} high.  It weighs {{convert|18.6|kg}}, and has a capacity of {{convert|15.8|l}}.  When filled, it would be inconveniently heavy to use.

Only two similar jugs are known in the UK.  All have similar shapes, bear inscriptions in English with similar lettering, and were made from leaded bronze, an alloy of copper, tin and lead, cast in a two-part mould in a similar manner using bronze spacers to separate the inner and outer moulds, with similar heraldic decorative motifs.  The Asante jug is the largest, and the only one to retain its lid.  

Of the other two jugs, the smallest is [[Wenlok jug]] in Luton: it was sold by [[Alexander Fermor-Hesketh, 3rd Baron Hesketh]] in 2005.  The third is the [[Robinson jug]], which was found in a farmhouse in Norfolk in the 1879 and is now in the collection of the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]].  The other two have fittings for a hinged lid but the lid has not survived.  

All three jugs were made in England.  The heraldic emblems on this jug link it to either [[Edward III]] or [[Richard II]].  The stag badges on the lid suggest Richard II, who used the white stag in the 1390s.  The jug was found in [[Manhyia Palace]] in Kumasi in 1895, but when and how it arrived in West Africa is not known.  It is speculated that it was carried from Europe to Africa in the Early Modern period as an impressive gift to present to an African ruler, having been bought cheaply there. There is a photograph taken in 1887 which shows the jug under a sacred tree at the royal palace.  

The jug was bought by the British Museum in 1896 from Major General [[Charles St Leger Barter]], who served in the [[Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War]] in December 1895 to February 1896 (also known as the Second Ashanti Expedition) which reached [[Kumasi]] and depose the [[Asantehene]] [[Prempeh I]].

Another plainer 14th century English lidded jug is in [[Leeds City Museum]].

'''Assück''' was an American [[grindcore]] band from Saint Petersburg [[Florida]], active from 1987 to 1998. The band proved influential,&lt;ref name=MusicMight /&gt; with their album ''Anticapital'' (1991) voted number 4 in the ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' list of their top 20 US grindcore albums, who described it as a "low-calibre battery of brooding, malicious, doom-ridden grind pitched somewhere between early [[Napalm Death]] and even earlier [[Bolt Thrower]]".&lt;ref name=Terrorizer&gt;Hoare, James (March 2009). "Criminal Records: Essential Records|US", ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' 181, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalist Greg Pratt, "Assück were an incredible band with probably metal's best drummer [Rob Proctor], although no one ever mentions his name. They combined well-written poetic and political lyrics with catchy songs, insane musicianship and a short-fast-loud brutality that no one has topped since."&lt;ref name=usgrind&gt;Stewart-Panko, Kevin (March 2009). "US Grind", ''Terrorizer'' 181, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Maximumrocknroll]]'', Felix von Havoc describes the political punk and metal roots of this band, stating "Assuck managed to combine the anger, fury and social commentary of a punk band with the musicianship and production quality of a Death Metal band."&lt;ref name="vonhavoc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1373">{{About|a form of Azerbaijani folk poetry|other uses|Bayat (disambiguation)}}

'''Bayati''' ({{lang-az|Bayatı}}) is one of the oldest forms of [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] folk poetry. A bayati consists of four lines, each of which has  seven syllables.  The rhyme scheme is aaba. Anonymous bayati have been collected as folk wisdom in editions such as ''Xalqimizin deyimlari va duyumlari'' (Our people's sayings and feelings). Bayati can also be strung together in sequence to form longer poems, and there are several bayati dastan, epics, in which all of the verses are bayati; one example is ''Arzu-Qamber''.&lt;ref name="Oldfield"/&gt;

Some folklorists associate the bayati with women's folk creativity, but male [[ashig]]s compose bayati as well. Intriguingly, some scholars argue that the bayati dastan are from a lost repertoire of women's dastan, but so far there is no firm evidence to support this theory. In the [[Zaqatala Rayon|Zagatala]] region of northern [[Azerbaijan]], male and female ashiqs who play the [[tanbur]] sing poetry composed only in the bayati meter.&lt;ref name="Oldfield"&gt;Anna C. Oldfield. Azerbaijani Women Poet-minstrels: Women Ashiqs from the Eighteenth Century to the Present. Edwin Mellen Press, 2008. P. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chick flick''' is a [[slang|slang term]] for the [[film genre]] dealing mainly with [[romance film|love and romance]] which is targeted to a female audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last= Simpson |editor-first=John |title= Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, on CD-ROM Version 4.0 |publisher= Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn= 978-0-19-956383-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-last= Stevenson |editor1-first= Angus |editor2-last= Lindberg |editor2-first= Christine A. |year=2010 |title= New Oxford American Dictionary, Third Edition |location=New York |publisher= Oxford University Press |page=300 |isbn=978-0-19-539288-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be specifically defined as a genre in which a woman is the protagonist. Although many types of films may be directed toward the female gender, "chick flick" is typically used only in reference to films that contain emotion or themes that are relationship-based (although not necessarily romantic as films may focus on parent-child or friend relationships). Chick flicks often are released ''[[en masse]]'' around [[Valentine's Day]].&lt;ref name=suck/&gt;&lt;ref name=click/&gt; The equivalent for male audiences is the [[guy-cry film]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Feminists such as [[Gloria Steinem]] have objected to terms such as "chick flick" and the related term "[[chick lit]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2007/jul/13/chick|title=Chick flicks or prick flicks, they're just films|first=Jenny|last=Colgan|date=13 July 2007|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a film critic has called the term "chick flick" derogatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/06/entertainment/la-et-mg-safe-haven-premiere-julianne-hough-josh-duhamel-20130206|title='Safe Haven' premiere: Don't call it a 'chick flick,' please|first=Amy|last=Kaufman|date=6 February 2013|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
Generally, a chick flick is a film designed to have an innate appeal to women, typically young women.&lt;ref name=click/&gt; Defining a chick flick is, as ''[[The New York Times]]'' has stated, more of a parlor game than a science.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |date= April 9, 2008 |accessdate= October 4, 2010 |publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]'' |title= Wary Hollywood Plans More Chick-Flicks (Hoping to Lure the Guys) |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/09/movies/09roma.html |first= Michael |last=Cieply }}&lt;/ref&gt; These films are generally held in [[popular culture]] as having formulaic, paint-by-numbers plot lines and characters. This makes usage of the term "problematic" for implying "frivolity, artlessness, and utter commercialism", according to [[ReelzChannel]].&lt;ref name=suck/&gt; However, several chick flicks have received high critical acclaim for their stories and performances. For example, the [[1983 in film|1983 film]] ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'' received [[Academy Awards]] for Best Screenplay, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Actor in a Supporting Role.&lt;ref name=terms/&gt; More recently, the film ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]'' (called a chick flick in some circles), featuring both [[Emma Stone]] and [[Ryan Gosling]], won Best Actress at the Academy Awards. Both of these actors were well known for their roles in chick flicks before jumping to the academy level.

Some frequent elements of chick flicks include having a female [[protagonist]],&lt;ref name=suck/&gt; thematic use of the [[Pink|color pink]] (along with [[Pink#In culture|metaphorical allusions of the color]]),&lt;ref name=click/&gt; and romance and/or dating-based storylines.&lt;ref name=twilight/&gt; Longtime producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] has remarked about the plots, "How do you cope with money and love?"&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Women are typically portrayed in chick flicks as sassy, noble victims, or klutzy twentysomethings.  Romantic comedies are considered a subgenre of the chick flick.  However, romantic comedies are typically respected more than chick flicks because they are designed to appeal to men and women.

Female [[MSN.com]] commentator Kim Morgan has written,
{{quote|[C]inema just wouldn't be the same without movies for and about women. And we don't just mean movies about pretty women, but all women and their issues&amp;nbsp;– something many guys don't usually have the patience for in real life. That's what sisters are for, right? Right... sisters or movies.&lt;ref name=morgan /&gt;}}

== History ==
{{expand section|date=October 2011}}
The term "chick flick" was not widely used until the 1980s and 1990s but is reported to have been coined by Brian Callaghan of Montreal, Canada in the mid-1970s while discussing movies with a friend in a schoolyard. It has its roots in the "[[Woman's film|women's pictures]]" of the early twentieth century, which portrays the woman as a victim and housewife, and later the ''[[film noir]]'' of the 1940s and early 1950s, which portrays the threat of sexualized women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chick Flicks: Contemporary Women at the Movies|last = Ferriss|first = Suzanne and Mallory Young|publisher = Routledge|year = 2008|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |title= The Chick Flick Paradox: Derogatory? Feminist? Or Both? |jstor= 20838769 |journal= Off Our Backs |date= 2007-01-01 |pages= 43–45 |volume= 37 |issue=1 |first= Natalia M. |last= Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Women &amp; Film: Both Sides of the Camera |last= Kaplan |first= E. Ann |publisher= Methuen, Inc. |year= 1983 |isbn= 0416317502 |location= New York |pages= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, many women who were in the workforce during [[World War II]] faced the transition back into the home. [[Brandon French]] notes that the women's films of the 1950s "shed light on a different cluster of issues and situations women faced in their transition from the forties to the sixties: romance, courtship, work, marriage, sex, motherhood, divorce, loneliness, adultery, alcoholism, widowhood, heroism, madness, and ambition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On The Verge of Revolt: Women in American Films of the Fifties |last= French |first= Brandon |publisher= Frederick Ungar Publishing Co. |year= 1978 |isbn= 0804422206 |location= New York |pages= xxii-xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1961 in film|1961 film]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', commonly known as one of the "classic" films from the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|golden age of cinema]], is sometimes considered an early chick flick due to common elements such as dealing with [[loneliness]], obsessive [[materialism]], and happy endings.&lt;ref name=suck/&gt;&lt;ref name=stylecaster/&gt; Author [[Molly Haskell]] has suggested that chick flicks are very different from the women's films of the 1940s and 1950s in that they now "sing a different tune." She feels that they are "more defiant and upbeat, [[post-modern]] and [[post-feminist]]."{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

In the U.S. in the [[1980s in film|1980s]], a succession of teenage drama pictures also labeled as chick flicks were released, many by director [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]. These often had a different and more realistic tone than previous chick flicks, with dramatic elements such as [[abortion]] and personal alienation being included.&lt;ref name=suck/&gt;

Several chick flicks have been patterned after the story of [[Cinderella]] and other [[fairy tale]]s (e.g. ''[[A Cinderella Story]]'', ''[[Ever After]]'', and ''[[Pretty Woman]]''), or even Shakespeare in the case of ''[[She's the Man]]'' and ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]''. In addition, a large number are adapted from popular novels (e.g. ''[[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]]'', ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'') and literary classics (e.g. ''[[Little Women (1994 film)|Little Women]]''). While most films that are considered chick flicks are lighthearted, some suspense films also fall under this category, such as ''[[What Lies Beneath]]''.

After the blockbuster success of the [[2008 in film|2008]] [[Drama film|drama]]/[[romance film]] ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', Paul Dergarabedian of Media By Numbers remarked, "[t]he word 'chick flick' is going to have to be replaced by big box-office girl-power flick" and that "[t]he box-office clout of the female audience is just astounding, and it's been an underserved audience for way too long". He also said, "they have no trouble finding money for the things they're passionate about." According to [[Fandango.com]], more than 75% of ''Twilight''{{'s}} opening-weekend audience was female.&lt;ref name="twilight" /&gt;

== Response to the term ==
The term “chick flick” has generated several negative responses from the modern [[Feminist movement|feminist]] community. Most criticisms of the genre concentrate on the negative consequences that arise from gendering certain interests, in this case film. Author of ''The Chick Flick Paradox: Derogatory? Feminist? or Both?'', Natalia Thompson, states that chick flicks are “an attempt to lump together an entire gender’s interests into one genre.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While the tailoring of interests may seem helpful and natural, many critics argue that unnecessary gendering can have negative consequences on many different social groups.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gender Stereotypes And The Logic Of Social Relations|last = Rimashevskaia|first = Natal'ia|date = 2008|journal = Russian Social Science Review|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there is evidence from Russian social scientist Natal'ia Rimashevskaia that gender stereotypes further perpetuated by the media can lead to discrimination against women and limit their “human and intellectual potential.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More criticisms of the term arise from actual content of the films in the chick flick genre and how the content affects society's perception of women. Some say that chick flicks are [[Microaggressions|micro-aggressions]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = SAGE Reference - Encyclopedia of Human Services and Diversity |url= http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/encyclopedia-of-human-services-and-diversity|doi = 10.4135/9781483346663|first = Linwood|last = Cousins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Micro-aggressions are actions or exchanges that degrade a person based on his or her membership in a "race, gender, age, and ability."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Critique of the genre ==
Despite the genre's obvious success, some film critics take issue with the content most chick flicks have in common. Although the subcategories represent different plot lines, all five have several characteristics in common. Many chick flicks can have an "ironic, self-deprecating tone", claims film theorist Hilary Radner.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Neo-Feminist Cinema: Girly Films, Chick Flicks, and Consumer Culture|last = Radner|first = Hilary|publisher = Routledge|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-415-87773-2|location = New York, New York|pages = 117–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tone is one of the defining characteristics of the genre, and many feel that it lacks substance compared to other genres.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Radner also goes on to say the genre is "incredibly heteronormative and white-washed."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These common characteristics of the genre can lead to criticism from minority groups and social justice activists.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; More issues with the genre emerge from the opinion that chick flicks play to every woman's "patriarchal unconscious."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Issues in Feminist Film Criticism|last = Erens|first = Patricia|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 1990|isbn = 0-253-31964-1|location = Bloomington|pages = 59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her article ''Structural Integrity, Historical Reversion, and the Post-9/11 Chick Flick'', Diane Negra focuses on several romantic comedies, deemed to be chick flicks, set in [[New York City]] after the [[September 11 attacks|attacks on September 11th, 2001.]] &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |url= http://ezp.slu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=fyh&amp;AN=31314272&amp;site=eds-live |title= Structural Integrity, Historical Reversion, and the Post-9/11 Chick Flick |last= Negra |first= Diane |date= 2008 |journal= Feminist Media Studies |doi= 10.1080/14680770701824902 |pmid= |access-date = December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that the films "centralize female subjectivity but more compellingly undertake political work to stabilize national identity post-9/11."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The political and social upheaval following the attacks led to a need for films that show the importance of protecting gender and family norms, or "ideological boundaries," as opposed to the emphasis on "survivalism" and "homeland security," used to protect national boundaries, seen in the action films at the time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Juxtaposed with the "politically innocent" genre of the pre-9/11 period, the films are rife with political undertones that are meant "to stabilize national identity post-9/11." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

While the plot of a chick flick is typically expected to be centered around a romantic conquest, Alison Winch ("We Can Have It All") writes about films she calls "girlfriend flicks."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |url= http://ezp.slu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=fyh&amp;AN=71115497&amp;site=eds-live|title = We Can Have It All|last = Winch|first = Alison|date = 2012|journal = Feminist Media Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These movies emphasize the relationships between friends instead of focusing on a love connection, and examples include ''[[Bride Wars]]'' and ''[[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]]''.

According to Winch, {{Quote|text = Girlfriend flicks often have savvy, “nervous,” female voice-overs mirroring typical romantic comedies, but addressing female spectators in their assumption of the mutual minefield of negotiating relationships, body, work, family, depression—issues prevalent in conduct, diet, and self-help books marketed specifically to women.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;|sign = |source = }}

Winch also states that girlfriend flicks are meant to criticize "second wave feminism’s superficial understanding of female solidarity" by showing "conflict, pain, and betrayal acted out between women."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; By emphasizing the "complexities of women's relationships,"  the girlfriend flick breaks the mold for the usual chick flick and allows the genre to gain a bit of depth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''''Coast Scene, Isles of Shoals''''' is a 1901 painting by [[Childe Hassam]] which is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11032?sortBy=Relevance&amp;amp;ft=Childe+Hassam&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;rpp=100&amp;amp;pos=61|title=www.metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Done in oil on canvas in luminous colours, the painting depicts the remote Isles of Shoals off the rocky shoreline of [[New England]], a favourite haunt of Childe Hassam at the end of the 19th century and where he painted a series of similar coastal scenes.

The painting is accompanied at the Metropolitan Museum of Art by ''[[Surf, Isles of Shoals]]'', a similar work by Hassam.

The work is currently (2018) not on view.

The '''coat of arms of Munich''' ''('''Münchner Wappen''')'' depicts a young monk dressed in black holding a red book. It has existed in a similar form since the 13th century, though at certain points in its history it has not depicted the central figure of the monk at all. As the German name for [[Munich]], München, means ''of Monks'', the [[monk]] in this case is a self-explanatory symbol ([[canting arms]]) who represents the city of Munich. 

Appearing on a document of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has a picture of a monk wearing an open hood. While all seal impressions show the monk with the book in one hand and three outstretched fingers in the other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later full-faced and bare-headed. By the 19th century the figure was portrayed as youthful and became known as the [[Münchner Kindl]] or ''Munich Child''. The [[coat of arms]] in its current form was created in 1957 and is still an important symbol of the [[Bavaria]]n state capital.

== The Monk ==
[[Image:München kleines stadtsiegel 1304.png|thumb|left|150px|Small seal, 1304]]
As the German name for Munich, i.e. München, means ''"of Monks"'',&lt;ref name=hdbg&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hdbg.de/gemeinden2/bayerns-gemeinden_detail.php?gkz=9162000 |title=Bayerns Gemeinden Detailansicht |publisher=Haus der Bayerischen Geschichte |language=German |accessdate=2008-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220040636/http://www.hdbg.de/gemeinden2/bayerns-gemeinden_detail.php?gkz=9162000 |archivedate=December 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[monk]] in this case is a self-explanatory symbol who represents the city of Munich. The figure is portrayed wearing a golden trimmed black [[cowl]] with a black hood and red shoes. The right hand is raised and the left carries a red book.

The open right hand of the monk is interpreted as an oath-making gesture, or a blessing gesture in Christian tradition.&lt;ref name=hdbg/&gt; The red book in the left hand refers to the oath book of the city (in accordance with the gesture of the right hand), or the municipal law book which is bounded in red and has been handed down since 1365.&lt;ref name=hdbg/&gt; Another interpretation is that it is a gospel book.&lt;ref name=hdbg/&gt;

When the Munich town administration developed a constitution of its council, a seal was necessary for the purposes of asserting the authenticity of town-council documents. Appearing on a document of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has a picture of a monk wearing an open hood.&lt;ref name="MChild"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.steincollectors.org/library/articles/MKindl/MKindl.htm|title=History of the Munich Child|last=Lowenstein|first=Jack|date=September 1968|publisher=steincollectors.org|accessdate=2008-07-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516224346/http://steincollectors.org/library/articles/MKindl/MKindl.htm|archivedate=2008-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While all seal impressions show the monk with the book in one hand and three outstretched fingers in the other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later full-faced and bare-headed. The monk as a sole heraldic figure can be found on a seal dating from the year 1304, and on flags of the city since the middle of the 14th century.&lt;ref name="ngw"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/m/munchen.htm|title=Wappen von MÜNCHEN|publisher=ngw.nl|accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colourful representations of the town's coat of arms stem from the 15th century.&lt;ref name=MChild/&gt;

=== Münchner Kindl ===
{{main|Münchner Kindl}}
In the course of the few centuries up until the current version of 1957, the coat of arms has undergone some distinctly visible changes. While some 15th-century portrayals already show a child figure instead of the monk, the monk in representations onwards began to lose its serious disposition, with curly hair and a more youthful-looking face.&lt;ref name=MChild/&gt; By the 18th century and especially the 19th century, the monk had been minimised into the [[Münchner Kindl]],&lt;ref name=hdbg/&gt; Bavarian for ''Munich Child'', a reference to the figure first documented in 1727,&lt;ref name=hdbg/&gt; although it is not clear when it appeared on the coat of arms for the first time or who coined the term. The transformation was brought about by artists such as sculptors and painters as well as copper and seal engravers, as opposed to a legal order.&lt;ref name=MChild/&gt;

In the second half of the nineteenth century, local artists also supplemented the figure with items such as radishes, pretzels, laurel wreaths and foaming beer steins.&lt;ref name=MChild/&gt; The symbol diversely appears in numerous places such as on manhole covers, beer steins and the top of the tower of the town hall.&lt;ref name="Kindl2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stadtmuseum-online.de/archiv/kindl2.htm|title=Archiv: Das Münchner Kindl - 2|publisher=stadtmuseum-online.de|language=German|accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the symbol as a man through being a monk was previously clear, its gender has become ambiguous since being designated the Kindl. One interpretation is that it is simply genderless, however in the 1920s a female inclination became apparent, and portrayals in person are to this day by young women.&lt;ref name="Kindl3"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stadtmuseum-online.de/archiv/kindl3.htm|title=Archiv: Das Münchner Kindl - 3|publisher=stadtmuseum-online.de|language=German|accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Munich coat of arms is verifiable from seals in 1239 and 1268. These seals show a monk in a gate, above which is in eagle, referring to the Bishop of Freising.&lt;ref name=hdbg/&gt; The city belonged to him and this was probably derived from his coat of arms.&lt;ref name=ngw/&gt; From 1313, the city was in possession of the [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]] Dukes and the eagle was replaced with a lion,&lt;ref name=ngw/&gt; a symbol of the old Bavarian and Palatine Wittelsbachs since the [[Fiefdom]] of Duke [[Louis I, Duke of Bavaria|Ludwig]] in 1214.&lt;ref name="bayern"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bayern.de/Coat-of-Arms-and-Flags-.654.htm|title=Bayerisches Landesportal: Coat of Arms and Flags|publisher=Bayrische Staatsregierung|accessdate=2008-07-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917195644/http://www.bayern.de/Coat-of-Arms-and-Flags-.654.htm|archivedate=2008-09-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coat of arms after ratification by Max I. Joseph ===
In 1808, King [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian I Joseph]] granted the city a [[Historicism (art)|historicist]] city emblem depicting a classical portal, atop which the King's crown lies. A golden lion sits in the gate's threshold with a sword in one paw and a shield with the letter "M" in the other. As an [[Enlightened absolutism|enlightened monarch]], Max I. Joseph wanted the city's symbol to show its culture and at the same time dispel the stereotype of the "''Mönchsbarbarei''", or the barbarianism of the monks.&lt;ref name=hdbg/&gt; However, the township decided against the complete elimination of the historical reference to the monk and thus in 1818 the M was replaced with the previous monk's head design.

=== Coat of arms after ratification by Ludwig I ===
In 1834, [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|King Ludwig I]] granted the city its old coat of arms again in the form of large and small crests. These embodied the small crest seal of 1304 and the large one of 1323. The 1835 coat of arms had a blue background, though this was later corrected to [[argent]] under [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|Ludwig II]] in 1865. The background was rarely changed. One example of its occurrence, however, was when [[Or (heraldry)|or]] was used in the 16th century instead.&lt;ref name=hdbg/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Coat of arms in the Third Reich ===
From 1936 to 1945, the lion was once again replaced by an eagle, only this time the one of the Nazi party, the ''Reichsadler''. Deemed the ''Hauptstadt der Bewegung'' (Capital of the Movement), Munich was a significant place in terms of the [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]]. The city was home to the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] headquarters, the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] and also saw the establishment of [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], the first Nazi concentration camp. Post-war designs were not pursued until 1949.&lt;ref name=hdbg/&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== New coat of arms ===
Both a small and large coat of arms existed from 1949 until 1957 based on representations of them prior to 1936. In 1957 both the large and small city coat of arms were newly arranged by the [[designer]] Eduard Ege. At the same time, the city council set the resolution on the December 17, 1957 that the large one was no longer for official use but only for particular representative purposes.&lt;ref name=hdbg/&gt;

Pictured is an interior display area of the [[National Gallery of Canada]].]]
'''Cultural policy''' is the government [[public policy|actions, laws and programs]] that regulate, protect, encourage and financially (or otherwise) support activities related to [[the arts]] and creative sectors, such as [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[literature]], and [[filmmaking]], among others and [[culture]], which may involve activities related to language, heritage and diversity. The idea of cultural policy was developed at UNESCO in the 1960s.  Generally, this involves governments setting in place processes, legal classifications, regulations, legislation and institutions (e.g., [[Art museum|galleries]], [[museum]]s, [[library|libraries]], [[opera house]]s, etc.) which promote and facilitate [[cultural diversity]] and creative expressions in a range of art forms and creative activities. Cultural policies vary from one country to another, but generally they aim to improve the [[accessibility]] of arts and creative activities to citizens and promote the [[artistic]], [[music]]al, [[ethnic]], [[sociolinguistic]], [[literary]] and other expressions of all people in a country. In some countries, especially since the 1970s, there is an emphasis on supporting the culture of [[indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] peoples and marginalized communities and ensuring that cultural industries (e.g., filmmaking or TV production) are representative of a country's diverse [[cultural heritage]] and ethnic and linguistic demographics. 

Cultural policy can be done at a nation-state level, at a sub-national  level (e.g., U.S. states or Canadian provinces), at a regional level or at a municipal level (e.g., a city government creating a museum or arts centre). Examples of cultural policy-making at the nation-state level could include anything from funding [[music education]] or theatre programs at little to no cost, to hosting corporate-sponsored art exhibitions in a government museum, to establishing legal codes (such as the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]]’s [[501(c)(3)]] tax designation for [[not-for-profit]] enterprises) and creating political institutions (such as the various [[minister of culture|ministries of culture]] and departments of culture and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in the United States), arts granting councils, and cultural institutions such as galleries and museums. Similar significant organisations in the United Kingdom include the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), and Arts Council England.

Throughout much of the twentieth century, many of the activities that compose cultural policy in the 2010s were governed under the title of "[[arts policy]]". Arts policy includes direct funding to artists, creators and art institutions and indirect funding to artists and arts institutions through the tax system (e.g., by making donations to arts charities tax deductible). However, as [[Kevin V. Mulcahy|Kevin Mulcahy]] has observed, "cultural policy encompasses a much broader array of activities than were addressed under arts policy. Whereas arts policy was effectively limited to addressing aesthetic concerns (e.g., funding art galleries and opera houses), the significance of the transformation to cultural policy can be observed in its demonstrable emphases on [[cultural identity]], [[valorization]] of [[Indigenous people|indigineity]] [Indigenous people's culture] and analyses of historical dynamics (such as [[hegemony]] and [[colonialism]])."&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 2006. "What is Cultural Policy?"&lt;/ref&gt; A general trend in Western industrialized nations is a shift, since the 1970s and 1980s, away from solely supporting a small number of relatively elite, professionalized art forms and institutions (e.g., [[Classical music]], painting, sculpture, art galleries) to also supporting amateur and community cultural and creative activities (e.g., [[community theatre]]) and cultural  forms which were not considered part of the [[Western canon]] by previous generations (e.g., [[traditional music]] such as [[blues]], [[World music]], and so on).

==History==
Prior to the twentieth century, the arts were typically supported by the patronage of the church, aristocrats such as kings and queens, and wealthy merchants. During the nineteenth century, artists increased their use of the private marketplace to earn revenue. For example, the composer [[Beethoven]] put on public concerts for which admission was charged. During the twentieth century, governments began to take over some of the arts patronage roles. Governments' first efforts to support culture were typically the establishment of archives, museums and libraries. Over the twentieth century, governments established a range of other institutions, such as arts councils and departments of culture. The first departments of culture typically supported the major arts that are part of the [[Western canon]], such as painting and sculpture, and the major performing arts (Classical music and theatre).
===Arts policy===
[[File:Choreographed Opera Performance (Carmen by Bizet).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Due to [[opera]] productions' huge stage sets, use of many costumed singers and the requirement for an [[Pit orchestra|orchestra]], opera is one of the most expensive arts to produce. As a result, most opera companies in the 21st century require government funding to operate.]]
In the twentieth century, Western governments in the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and many European nations developed arts policy measures to promote, support and protect the arts, artists and arts institutions. These governments' arts policy initiatives generally had two aims: supporting excellence in the arts and broadening access to the arts by citizens. &lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. ''The Economics of Cultural Policy''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 59-63 &lt;/ref&gt; An example of an arts policy initiative that supports excellence would be a government grant program which provides funding to the highest-achieving artists in the country. A concrete example would be a literary prize of $100,000 for the best fiction authors from the country, as selected by a panel of top experts. An example of an arts policy initiative that aims at increasing access to the arts would be a music in the schools program funded by the government. A concrete example would be a program which funded an [[orchestra]] or [[jazz quartet]] and paid them to play free concerts in elementary schools. This would enable children from lower- and middle-income families to hear live music. 

The two goals, supporting excellence and broadening access, are often [[trade-off]]s, as any increase in emphasis on one policy objective typically has an adverse effect on the other goal.&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. ''The Economics of Cultural Policy''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 59-63 &lt;/ref&gt; To give an example, if a hypothetical country has a $12 million per year grant program for [[orchestra]]s in the country, if the government focuses on the goal of supporting musical excellence, it may decide to provide $4 million per year to the three top orchestras in the country, as determined by a panel of independent professional [[music critic]]s, conductors and music professors. This decision would strongly support the goal of enhancing excellence, as funding would only go to the top musical groups. However, this approach would only enable citizens in three cities to have access to professional orchestras.

On the other hand, if the government was focusing on broadening access to symphony concerts, it might direct the independent panel to pick 12 orchestras in the country, with the stipulation that only one orchestra per city be selected. By proving $1 million per year to 12 orchestras in 12 cities, this would enable citizens from 12 cities in the country to see live orchestra shows. However, by funding 12 orchestras, this would mean that funding would go to ensembles that do not meet the highest standards of excellence. Thus, excellence and broadening access are often trade-offs.

==Theoretical approaches==

Cultural policy, while a small part of the budgets of even the most generous of governments, governs a sector of immense complexity.  It entails “a large, heterogeneous set of individuals and organizations engaged in the creation, production, presentation, distribution, and preservation of and education about aesthetic heritage, and entertainment activities, products and artifacts”.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 2002. “Arts and Culture.” in &lt;u&gt;The State of Nonprofit America&lt;/u&gt;. ed. Lester M. Salamon. Washington D.C.: Brookings University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A cultural policy necessarily encompasses a broad array of activities and typically involves public support for:
* Heritage, battlefield and historic preservation sites
* Zoos, botanical gardens, arboretums, aquariums, parks
* Libraries and museums (fine arts, scientific, historical)
* [[Visual arts]] (film, painting, sculpture, pottery, architecture)
* [[Performing arts]] (symphonic, chamber and choral music; jazz, hip-hop and folk music; ballet, ballroom and modern dance; opera and musical theatre; circus performances, rodeos and marching bands)&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida, Yukihiko,　''Jane Barlow and Witaly Osins, ballet teachers who worked in postwar Japan, and their students'', Pan-Asian Journal of Sports &amp; Physical Education, Vol.3(Sep), 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Public humanities]] programs ([[public broadcasting]], [[creative writing]], [[poetry]])

Some governments may place policy areas from this list in other ministries or departments. For example, national parks may be assigned to an environment department, or public humanities may be delegated to an education department.  

Since culture is a [[public good]] (i.e., contributes a public value to society for which it is hard to exclude non-payers, as all of society benefits from arts and culture) and something that is generally viewed as a [[merit good]], governments have pursued programs to promote greater accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;d'Angelo, Mario and Vesperini, Paul. 1999. Cultural Policies in Europe: Method and Practice of Evaluation, Council of Europe Publishing, Strasbourg&lt;/ref&gt; In this way of thinking, significant aesthetic works such as paintings and sculptures should be made broadly available to the public. In other words, “high culture” should not be the exclusive preserve of a particular social class or of a metropolitan location. Rather, the benefits of the highest reaches of cultural excellence should be made in an egalitarian manner; national cultural treasures should be accessible without regard to the impediments of class circumstances, educational attainment or place of habitation. A democratic state cannot be seen as simply indulging the aesthetic preferences of a few, however enlightened, or of overtly infusing art with political values. Consequently, a democratic cultural policy must articulate its purposes in ways that demonstrate how the public interest is being served. These purposes have often been expressed as involving either the creation of [[cultural democracy]] or the [[democratization of culture]].

The objective of cultural democratization is the aesthetic enlightenment, enhanced dignity, and educational development of the general citizenry. “Dissemination was the key concept with the aim of establishing equal opportunity for all citizens to participate in publicly organized and financed cultural activities”.&lt;ref&gt;Duelund, Peter. 2001. “Cultural Policy in Denmark.” ''The Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 31: 34-57.&lt;/ref&gt; To further this goal, performances and exhibitions are low cost; public art education promotes equality of aesthetic opportunity; national institutions tour and perform in work places, retirement homes and housing complexes.

As indicated earlier, the “democratization of culture” is a top-down approach that promulgates certain forms of cultural programming that are deemed to be a public good. Clearly, such an objective is open to criticism for what is termed cultural [[elitism]]; that is, the assumption that some aesthetic expressions are inherently superior - at least as determined by a cognoscenti concerned with the acquisition of [[cultural capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. 1984. &lt;u&gt;Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste&lt;/u&gt;. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; “The problem with this policy [is] that, fundamentally, it intend[s] to create larger audiences for performances whose content [is] based on the experience of society’s privileged groups. In sum, it has… taken for granted that the cultural needs of all society’s members [are] alike”.&lt;ref&gt;Langsted, Jorn, ed. 1990. &lt;u&gt;Strategies: Studies in Modern Cultural Policy&lt;/u&gt;. Aarhus University Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of cultural democracy, on the other hand, is to provide for a more participatory (or populist) approach in the definition and provision of cultural opportunities.

The coupling of the concept of democratization of culture to cultural democracy has a pragmatic as well as a philosophical component. [[Cultural patronage]] in democratic governments is markedly different from patronage by wealthy individuals or corporations. Private or politically paramount patrons are responsible only to themselves and are free to indulge in their tastes and preferences. Democratic governments, on the other hand, are responsible to the electorate and are held accountable for their policy decisions.

The two objectives just discussed - dissemination of high culture and participation in a broader range of cultural activities - evoke a related debate about the content of public culture: “[[elitist]]” or “[[populism|populist]].” 
===Elitism===
Proponents of the elitist position argue that cultural policy should emphasize aesthetic quality as the determining criterion for public subvention. This view is typically supported by the major cultural organizations, creative artists in the traditionally defined field of the fine arts, cultural critics, and the well-educated, well-to-do audiences for these art forms. [[Ronald Dworkin]] terms this the “lofty approach,” which “insists that art and culture must reach a certain degree of sophistication, richness, and excellence in order for human nature to flourish, and that the state must provide this excellence if the people will not or cannot provide it for themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Ronald. 1985. “Can a Liberal State Support Art?” in &lt;u&gt;A Matter of Principle&lt;/u&gt;. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 221-233.&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of the elitist position generally focus on supporting the creation, preservation and performance of works of the [[Western canon]], a group of artworks that are viewed as the best artistic and cultural products of Western society.

===Populism===
By contrast, the populist position advocates defining culture broadly and inclusively and making this culture broadly available.  The populist approach emphasizes a less traditional and more pluralist notion of artistic merit and consciously seeks to create a policy of cultural diversity. With a focus on personal enhancement, the populist’s position posits very limited boundaries between amateur and professional arts activities. Indeed, the goal is to provide opportunities for those outside the professional mainstream. To give an example, whereas an elite approach advocates support for professional musicians, particularly those from [[Classical music]], a populist approach would advocate support for amateur, community singers and musicians.

“Proponents of populism are frequently advocates of minority arts, [[folk arts]], ethnic arts, or [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] activities” as Kevin V. Mulcahy said.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 1982. “Controversies in Arts Policymaking.” in &lt;u&gt;Public Policy and the Arts&lt;/u&gt;. eds. Kevin V. Mulcahy and C. Richard Swaim. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural “elitists,” on the other hand, argue in support of excellence over amateurism and favor an emphasis on aesthetic discipline over “culture as everything.” There are “two key tensions for national cultural policy between the goals of excellence versus access, and between government roles as facilitator versus architect”.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, Jennifer; McAllister, Libby; and Davis, Glyn. 2003. “Paradoxes and Contradictions in Government Approaches to Contemporary Cultural Policy: An Australian Perspective.” ''The International Journal of Cultural Policy''. 9: 17-34.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Kevin V. Mulcahy argued that in effect, elitism is cultural democracy as populism is to the democratization of culture. Unfortunately, there has been a tendency to see these positions as mutually exclusive, rather than complementary. “Elitists” are denounced as “high brow snobs” advocating an esoteric culture which focuses on [[art music]] and the types of art seen in museums and galleries; populists are dismissed as “pandering philistines” promoting a trivialized and commercialized culture, as they endorse the value of [[popular music]] and [[folk art]]. However, these mutual stereotypes belie complementariness between two bookends of an artistically autonomous and politically accountable cultural policy. There is a synthesis that can be termed a “latitudinarian approach” to public culture; that is, one that is aesthetically inclusive and broadly accessible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin V. Mulcahy|Mulcahy, Kevin V.]] 1995b. “The NEA and the Reauthorization Process: Congress and Arts Policy Issues.” in Mulcahy and Wyszomirski, &lt;u&gt;America’s Commitment to Culture&lt;/u&gt;. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 1995c. “The Public Interest and Arts Policy.” in Mulcahy and Wyszomirski, &lt;u&gt;America’s Commitment to Culture&lt;/u&gt;. Boulder: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viewpoints==
Such a public-cultural policy would remain faithful to the highest standards of excellence from a broad range of aesthetic expressions while providing the widest possible access to people from different geographic locales, socio-economic strata, and educational background, as Dr. Mulcahy said.&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 1991. “The Public Interest in Public Culture.” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 21: 5-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In conceiving of public policy as an opportunity to provide alternatives not readily available in the marketplace, public cultural agencies would be better positioned to complement the efforts of the private sector rather than duplicate their activities.  Similarly, cultural agencies can promote [[community development]] by supporting artistic heritages that are at a competitive disadvantage in a cultural world that is increasingly profit-driven. In sum, excellence should be viewed as the achievements of greatness from a horizontal, rather than a vertical, perspective and a cultural policy as supporting the totality of these varieties of excellence.

These attitudes about a public cultural responsibility stand in marked contrast to much of the rest of the world, where culture is a question of historic patrimony, or the national identities of peoples, whether in independent states or regions within more powerful states. Inevitably, sensitive issues are involved in any discussion of culture as a public policy. However, given the demands in a democratic system that public policies show a return to the taxpayer, cultural policy has frequently argued for support on the basis of utility. It can be argued that there is a parity between the state’s responsibility for its citi’ social-economic-physical needs and their access to culture and opportunities for artistic self-expression. However, the aesthetic dimension of public policy has never been widely perceived as intuitively obvious or politically imperative. Accordingly, the cultural sector has often argued its case from the secondary, ancillary benefits that result from public support for programs that are seemingly only aesthetic in nature. Cultural policy is not typically justified solely on the grounds that it is a good-in-itself, but rather that it yields other good results.

The future of cultural policy would seem to predict an increasingly inexorable demand that the arts “carry their own weight” rather than rely on a public subsidy to pursue “art for art’s sake”.&lt;ref&gt;Wyszomirski, Margaret J. 1995a. “Federal Cultural Support: Toward a New Paradigm?” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law, and Society''. 25: 69-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin V. Mulcahy dubbed this “cultural [[Darwinism]]” is most pronounced in the United States where public subsidy is limited and publicly supported aesthetic activities are expected to demonstrate a direct public benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Kevin V. 2003. “The State Arts Agency: An Overview of Cultural Federalism in the United States.” ''Journal of Arts Management, Law and Society''. 32: 67-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-American cultural institutions are less constrained by the need to maintain diversified revenue streams that demand high levels of earned income and individual and corporate donations to compensate for limited government appropriations.

On the other hand, cultural institutions everywhere are increasingly market-driven in their need for supplementary funds and as a justification for continued public support. The American model of an essentially [[privatization|privatized]] culture is increasingly attractive to governments seeking to curtail their cultural subsidies. In a system of [[mixed funding]], public culture can nurture the arts groups and cultural activities that contribute to individual self-worth and community definition even if counting for less in the economic bottom-line. At root, a cultural policy is about creating public spheres that are not dependent upon [[profit motive]]s nor validated by commercial values. As political democracy is dependent upon the existence of civil society and socio-economic pluralism, cultural policy stands as an essential public commitment in realizing these fundamental preconditions.

One of the available and yet underappreciated tools in cultural policy at the national level is the reduction of VAT rates for cultural goods and services. Economic theory can be used to explain how reduced fiscal rates are expected to decrease prices and increase quantities of consumed cultural goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiecki, Karol J. and Trilce Navarette 2015. “[https://ideas.repec.org/p/cue/wpaper/awp-02-2015.html Fiscal and Economic Aspects of Book Consumption in the European Union].” ACEI Working Paper 02-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Fiscal policy can be an important part of cultural policy, in particular the VAT rate discounts on cultural consumption, yet it receives less attention than deserved.

==Scope==
At the international level [[UNESCO]] is in charge of cultural policy. Contact information for ministries of culture and national arts councils in 160 countries is available from the website of the [[International Federation of Arts Councils and Culture Agencies]] (IFACCA). On a local scale, subnational (e.g., state or provincial governments), city and local governments offer citizens and local authorities the opportunity to develop arts and culture with the Agenda 21 for Culture.

==Research==
Cultural policy research is a field of academic inquiry that grew out of [[cultural studies]] in the 1990s. It grew out of the idea that cultural studies should not only be critical, but also try to be useful.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Bennett, ''Culture, A reformer's Science'', SAGE, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, there are many departments of Cultural Policy Studies around the world.

[[File:Hisgen Daniel Unterschrift.jpg|thumb|Signature as "Hisgen pictor" (painter) on a bill from 1765]]
'''Daniel Hisgen''' (April 10, 1733 probably in Nieder-Weisel, Hesse, Germany &amp;ndash; February 19, 1812 in [[Lich, Hesse|Lich]]) was a German painter of the [[rococo]] period who worked as a church painter in [[Upper Hesse]], specializing on cycles of paintings decorating the front of the gallery parapet in churches with an upper gallery. His discreet cycles demonstrate the modest prominence expected of [[Lutheran art]] in German churches of his day, taking a middle route between the large and prominent images in Catholic churches, and the complete absence of images in Calvinist ones.  

== Life and family ==
[[File:Seelenhofgasse 2 (Lich) 01.JPG|thumb|Residence of the Hisgen family in the Seelenhofgasse 2 in Lich]]
The ancestors of the Hisgen (meaning "little house") family fled as Huguenots from France to the Netherlands and then distributed to the area near [[Montabaur]], [[Wetzlar]] and [[Lich]]. Daniel Hisgen was the oldest son of the Protestant pastor Johann Georg Hisgen (August 30, 1707 - June 2, 1769) and his wife Johannetta Judith Budoin (Johanna Budi) (February 4, 1706 - February 23, 1765). Daniel's godmother was an unmarried sister of his father.&lt;ref name="Worm8"&gt;Worm: ''Daniel Hisgen.'' 2012, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Johann Georg was a native of Wetzlar and pastor at Nieder-Weisel ([[Butzbach]]) for 37 years from 1732 to his death. Daniel grew up in the village of Nieder-Weisel where his parents are still buried in a crypt in the Protestant church. When the church records of Nieder-Weisel were destroyed by fire in 1761, Johann Georg and the villagers created a new church book from memory for the years from 1690 to 1761. Nieder-Weisel citizens and Johann Georg went all the way to the Reichskammergericht (highest court in the Holy Roman Empire) on a dispute about building defects.

On November 28, 1769 Daniel Hisgen married Philippina Louisa Stiehl (baptized August 8, 1747 - August 8, 1820) from Alten-Buseck. A [[penance]] was imposed on both because the first daughter Johannetta Catharina (December 21, 1769 - March 3, 1834) was born just four weeks after the wedding.&lt;ref name = "Worm8"/&gt; Daniel settled in Lich and the marriage produced five children. The oldest daughter remained unmarried, the others were Friedrich Wilhelm (March 22, 1773 - March 1, 1853), Maria Elisabetha (Born May 5, 1775), Christian Wilhelm (April 13, 1777 - May 27, 1839) and Johann Heinrich (born June 30, 1780). Godfather of the latter was Daniel's brother Johann Henrich Hisgen, who is documented as a "Kauf- und Handelsmann in [[Wetzlar]]" (tradesman in Wetzlar).&lt;ref name="Worm9"&gt;Worm: ''Daniel Hisgen'' 2012, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest son Friedrich Wilhelm, a government secretary in Hungen, was married to Catharina Margartha Rouge (born January 6, 1786). The couple had 14 children including a son called Georg Konrad (April 20, 1820 in Lich - March 16, 1898), who emigrated without his wife Katharina Preiss (1819-1898) to America. Daniel's fourth child, Christian Wilhelm, also became a painter and a merchant and grocer. He married Katharina Elisabeth Hornivius (1775 - April 13, 1859) and had six children, including Johann Conrad Hisgen (August 9, 1810 - May 26, 1897). Johann Conrad, painter and varnisher, was in his first marriage married to  Anna Margarete Jung (August 14, 1815 - June 5, 1836). After her death he married Juliana Barbara Völnele. In his third marriage he had four children. He emigrated to America and left a half year old child in [[Hameln]], for which he was sentenced to jail for four weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Heimatkundlicher Arbeitskreis Lich (Ed.): ''Lich. Vergangenheit und Gegenwart.'' 2. edition, Heimatkundlicher Arbeitskreis, Lich 1986, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Quirin Hisgen (March 21, 1812 - June 11, 1894), another son of Christian Wilhelm, became a painter and emigrated to America. A grandson of Christian Wilhelm, called Karl Maximilian Hisgen (February 2, 1844 - July 12, 1905) became a painter, also his eponymous son Karl Maximilian (October 7, 1878). Johann Heinrich, fifth child of Daniel Hisgen, temporarily lived in Engelrod. In 1818 he painted a portrait of [[Martin Luther]] with a swan (oil on wood) for the Protestant church in Nieder-Oberrod, and 1837 a similar scene in a medallion for the Protestant church in Michelbach (Schotten).&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Seib, Volkmar Joestel, Jutta Strehle (Ed.): ''Luther mit dem Schwan. Tod und Verklärung eines großen Mannes.'' Schelzky &amp; Jeep, Berlin 1996, p. 129, 152, 155.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847 he is documented as a picture restorer in [[Darmstadt]]. Probably the most famous descendant of Daniel Hisgen is [[Thomas L. Hisgen]] (November 26, 1858 - August 27, 1925), an American petroleum producer and politician.&lt;ref&gt;pm: ''Bilder von Daniel Hisgen landeten als "barocker Kitsch" auf dem Bauschutt'', Butzbacher Zeitung, December 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hisgen emerges primarily as a church painter in [[Upper Hesse]] and worked mainly in what is now the [[Giessen (district)|Giessen district]], but also sporadically in the Wetzlar area and in the [[Vogelsberg Mountains|Vogelsberg]] region. His identity has long been unclear, so that he was provisionally designated as the "Freienseer Master". Due to his characteristic style and the cyclic structure of his gallery-paintings with biblical motifs, the parapet-paintings on railings in Bobenhausen II, Albach, Burkhardsfelden, Freienseen and Odenhausen/Lahn were attributed to the same artist. The biblical characters on the pictures wear contemporary clothes of the Rococo period, which is particularly evident in the pictures of the infant [[Moses]] rescued by the Egyptian princess from the river. The characters in these scenes are shown in the same way in all cycles.&lt;ref&gt;G. Ulrich Großmann: ''Kunstgeschichte des Kreises Gießen.'' In: Konrad Theiss, Hans Schleuning (Ed.): ''Der Landkreis Gießen zwischen Lahn und Vogelsberg.'' Theiss, Stuttgart 1976, {{ISBN|3-8062-0151-X}}, p. 137–153, here: p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable to the bible illustrations by Christoph Murer in the ''Tübingen Bible'' (1591), Hisgen stands in the tradition of the [[Biblia pauperum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gemeinde-lebt.de/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=33&amp;cntnt01pagelimit=5&amp;cntnt01returnid=63 ''Die Evangelische Kirche in Atzbach''].&lt;/ref&gt; These works of provincial art lean on models, but develop those in the late [[Baroque]] style, which is reflected in the use of light on moving figures. This synthesis has been called a "dramatic art of the simple" ("Dramatik des Schlichten").&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Hinkel: ''Die Emporenmalereien in der evangelischen Pfarrkirche Leihgestern.'' In: Evangelische Kirchengemeinde Leihgestern (Ed.): ''1908–2008. 100 Jahre Kirchweihfest der Evangelischen Kirche Leihgestern.'' Linden 2008, p. 68–79, here: p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; In Atzbach and other churches his students or children are chronicled to have contributed with "clumsy hands" ("ungeschickteren Händen") on the parapet-paintings, suggesting the good reputation of the master.&lt;ref name="Worm9" /&gt;

Until 2015 twelve upper Hessian churches (all heritage listed) have been identified as having pictures with biblical scenes by Hisgen. In general there is the same number of pictures from the Old Testament and the New Testament. Illustrations of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] make the biggest part among paintings from the [[New Testament]]. The more than 300 images show 66 scenes from the Bible, from which 28 scenes have been painted only once. Hisgen used the same compositions for illustrations that occur repeatedly, like the [[Annunciation]] and the [[Birth of Christ]].&lt;ref name="GZ" /&gt;  Exceptionally, the paintings in the church in Pohl-Göns  only show apostles and evangelists. Some cycles have ''[[tituli]]'' or captions with the related biblical passage.

As a church painter Hisgen also painted church ceilings and other works. A first activity as a painter can be traced on a bill from Nieder-Weisel in 1754.&lt;ref name="GZ"&gt;[http://www.giessener-zeitung.de/langgoens/beitrag/108353/unbekanntes-bild-von-hisgen-entdeckt/ ''Unbekanntes Bild von Hisgen entdeckt''], Gießener Zeitung, December 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It's unknown where Hisgen learnt the craft of painting, perhaps he was self-taught. In the years 1762/1763 he worked for 126 days on new surfaces for the pulpit and the princes gallery in St. Mary's collegiate church in Lich, for which he received 292 [[Guilder]]. In the church in Albach Hisgen decorated the cheeks of the church pews with floral pattern and the corners of the ceiling with angel medallions. In 1778 he gilded the [[finial]], the [[weathervane]] and the star of the church in the Ober-Hörgern. In 1780 Hisgen provided the organ case of St. Mary's collegiate church in Lich in 1780 with a new edging and gilding and painted the [[Pipe organ#Casing|casing]] silver.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Bösken, Hermann Fischer: ''Quellen und Forschungen zur Orgelgeschichte des Mittelrheins'', Vol. 3: Ehemalige Provinz Oberhessen, suppl. 1 (A–L), Beiträge zur Mittelrheinischen Musikgeschichte 29,1, Schott, Mainz 1988, {{ISBN|3-7957-1330-7}}, p. 609.&lt;/ref&gt; 1808, in the high age of 75 years, Hisgen painted the church in Odenhausen (Lahn).&lt;ref name="Weyrauch144"&gt;Weyrauch: ''Die Kirchen des Altkreises Gießen.'' 1979, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, a small painting with an idyllic landscape by Hisgen was discovered in Lich.&lt;ref name="GZ" /&gt;

Inscription on the up-right: HEOS ("[[Eos]]"),  ΔΟRIS EΓRAΦSEN ("Doris Egraphsen"—''Doris drew me''). Inscription on the right: MEMNON ("[[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]]"), KALIAΔES EΠOIESEN ("Kaliades epoiesen"—''Kaliades made me'').&lt;/ref&gt; is the phrase ''Hermogenes kalos'' ([[Red-figure pottery|Attic red-figure]] cup, ca. 490–480 BC, from [[Capua]]; at the [[Louvre]])]]

A '''''kalos'' inscription''' (''καλός'') is a form of [[epigraphy|epigraph]] found on [[Attic vase]]s and graffiti in antiquity, mainly during the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]] from 550 to 450 BC. The word ''kalos'' (καλός) means "beautiful", and in the inscriptions it had an erotic connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Clark, Maya Elston, and Mary Louise Hart, ''Understanding Greek Vases: A Guide to Terms, Styles, and Techniques'' (Getty Museum, 2002), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The ''kalos'' inscription is typically found on vessels used for a [[symposium]]. The scenes that accompany the inscription vary, and include athletic exercises and [[Greek mythology|myths]].

Some inscriptions are generic, reading only "the boy is beautiful" (ὅ παῖς καλός).&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Elston, and Hart, ''Understanding Greek Vases,'' p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription more often took the form of the beloved's name, in the [[nominative]] singular, followed by "kalos" (''X kalos'', i.e. "X is beautiful"). The beloved is most often a male youth, but sometimes girls or women were spoken of as ''kalē'' (καλή). In one early cataloging of the inscriptions, among the individuals labeled as beautiful were 30 women and girls, and 528 youths.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Kroll]], "[http://www.well.com/user/aquarius/kroll-pederasty.htm  Knabenliebe]" in Pauly-Wissowa, ''Realencyclopaedie der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft,'' vol. 11, cols. 897–906.&lt;/ref&gt; Male names outnumber female by more than twenty to one. At least some of the women labeled ''kalē'' were ''[[Hetaera|hetairai]]'', courtesans or prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Elston, and Hart, ''Understanding Greek Vases,'' p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Discobolus_Kleomelos_Louvre_G111.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Attic [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] with the inscription "Kleomelos Kalos": the youth Kleomelos ("he of glorious limbs") practises [[discus]] throwing in a [[gymnasion|gymnasium]]]]
The names designated as ''kalos'' are characteristic of aristocratic citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Elston, and Hart, ''Understanding Greek Vases,'' p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''kalos'' inscriptions are associated with certain vase painters or pottery workshops. The [[Antimenes Painter]], for instance, is named for the ''kalos'' inscription to Antimenes on his pots, and the [[Leagros Group]] pottery workshop is named for the youth Leagros, a widely popular object of ''kalos'' praise.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Elston, and Hart, ''Understanding Greek Vases,'' p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; These associations suggest a cult of celebrity or a concerted effort by a given youth's family to increase their son's public standing.

The purpose of these inscriptions remains uncertain, and many examples may be declarations of love as part of [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|same-sex courtship in Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Elston, and Hart, ''Understanding Greek Vases,'' p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the inscriptions or vessels may have been made to order.

''Kalos'' names are also found as graffiti on walls, the most abundant example being the find on [[Thassos]] of 60 ''kalos'' inscriptions carved on rock dating from the 4th century. The non-epigraphic literary evidence consists of two references in [[Aristophanes]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristophanes, ''[[The Acharnians]]'', line 144; ''[[The Wasps]]'', lines 97-99.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these instances, however, praise the ''[[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]]'' (the citizenry as a whole) rather than any individual, and suggest the public performance role of the ''kalos'' tag.{{clarify|date=June 2012}}

The '''''Lamentation over the Dead Christ''''', is a painting of the common subject of the [[Lamentation of Christ]] by the [[Italian Renaissance]] master [[Sandro Botticelli]], finished around 1490-1492. It is now in the [[Alte Pinakothek]], in [[Munich]].

The portrait shows the inert body of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] surrounded by the [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]], [[St. Peter]], and [[Mary Magdalene]], [[St. John the Evangelist]], [[St. Jerome]] and [[St. Paul]].

The pathetic expressions of the characters were a novelty in Botticelli's art: under the spiritual influence of [[Savonarola]]'s preachings in [[Florence]], which began around the time the work was executed, he started in fact to abandon the allegoric inspiration that had made him a favourite of the Medici court in favour of more intimate and painstaking religious reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artonline.it/opera.asp?IDOpera=48 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930160530/http://www.artonline.it/opera.asp?IDOpera=48 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Li-Ke in Wat Khung Taphao.ogg|thumb|Snippet from a ''likay'' performance at [[Wat Khung Taphao]], Uttaradit Province]]

'''Likay''' ({{lang-th|ลิเก}}, {{RTGS|''like''}}, {{IPA-th|líʔ.kēː|pron}}) is a form of popular folk theatre from [[Thailand]]. Its uniqueness is found in the combination of extravagant costumes with barely equipped stages and vaguely determined storylines, so that the performances depend mainly on the actors' skills of [[improvisation]] and the audiences' imagination.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1951/JSS_039_1d_Smithies_LikayOriginFormAndFutureOfSiameseFolkOpera.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="r5"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sukphisit |first=Suthon |title=The vanishing of Thailand: Folk Arts and Folk Culture |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
There are several competing ideas about the origins and development of likay. However, the most likely is that likay has roots in the Malay [[jikey]], an Islamic [[chant]]. Since there is a wide gap between this religious performance and folk entertainment, it is also possible that Likay derives from India instead, especially as there are many [[Indian dance]] gestures found in the actors' performances.&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accu.or.jp/ich/en/arts/A_THA4.html|title=Lakhon Chatri|author=Asia⁄Pacific Cultural Centre for UNESCO (ACCU)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Likay Thai Folk Dance 2220386793.jpg|thumb|Likay Actor]]

The lack of historic references also creates controversy about the first emergence of likay, but it is most likely to have emerged as a distinct form of theatre in the late-19th century.&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; Today the performances mainly take place in rural areas, at temple fairs, and private sponsored events. Even though TV and radio still broadcast performances of likay, this form of folk theatre is becoming rarer.&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r5" /&gt;

== Repertoire ==
=== Stories ===
The likay story repertoire ranges from historic incidents to well known [[Folklore|folk tales]] larded with humorous anecdotes. The main characters are [[phra]] (hero), nang (heroine), kong (villain), itcha (villainess), and joker (male or female clowns) in the roles of [[stereotype]]d princesses, kings, and lower class figures with caricatured appearances and a lot of freedom in speech.&lt;ref name="r4"&gt;http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/14443/1/WRAP_THESIS_Tungtang_2011.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their fates unfold in stories of love which usually involve overcoming obstacles, as well as in family dramas which always have a [[happy ending]]. Although the language and character of some of the figures are rude and barely represent appropriate decency, good and bad are sharply distinguished and the troupes leave the audience with a clear moral with the good always defeating the bad.&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r3"&gt;http://110.102.33.234/journals/asian_theatre_journal/v021/21.1diamond.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popular characters ===
The figures Khun Chang and Khun Paen are amongst the most popular characters in likay. Based on a well-known [[Thai folklore]] tale (named after the two main characters [[Khun Chang Khun Phaen]]) about a dramatic love triangle, the two men compete for one beautiful woman and reappear in countless likay performances.&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r3" /&gt;

Another popular character borrowed from local ghost folklore is [[Mae Nak Phra Khanong]]. Her story, also about love and death, focuses on her afterlife as a ghost. Her unbreakable love for her husband, even beyond death, and the terror she spreads out of jealousy and anger repeatedly finds new interpretations in likay folk theatre.&lt;ref name="r3" /&gt;

== Performance ==
"Awk khaek" ({{lang-th|ออกแขก}}; {{rtgs|''ok khaek''}}) is the performance before likay begins when the performer comes out with an Indian-Malaysian costume to sing and dance to a song.&lt;ref name="r6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thai-food.in.th/Thai-Theatre-and-Thai-Dance.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216190558/http://www.thai-food.in.th/Thai-Theatre-and-Thai-Dance.html |archivedate=2013-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="r7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skn.ac.th/skl/project/likay/likay1.htm|title=Awk khake|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awk khaek came from India with the Malayan Peninsula group that came to Siam during the Ayutthaya period (1259-1767 CE),&lt;ref name="r8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediathai.org/Tairace/likay.htm |title=Likay... Dramatic Performance of Thai Life |publisher=encyclopediathai.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028044124/http://www.encyclopediathai.org/TaiRace/likay.htm |archivedate=October 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="r9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thaichristianfoundation.org/books/|title=Dance-Drama before the Throne|last=Allan|first=Eubank|date=|access-date=March 9, 2017|work=Thai Christian Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this performance has changed with time. There is disagreement where the name comes from, but L. Allan Eubank says that the word "awk" means "out" and the word "khaek" is the Thai word for Indian.&lt;ref name="r9" /&gt; The importance of awk khaek is to tell everyone to know that the likay will start soon.

In general, after an hour-long prelude with [[piphat]] music, the plot and dialogue follow a basic outline given by the troupe's storyteller, unfolding through the actors' improvised verses, song lyrics, and action. This impromptu performance is supported by musicians who capture and highlight the spontaneous development with their instruments, often including both modern pop music and traditional country music. Dances appear only rarely when an actor or actress feels like the situation calls for it.&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r4" /&gt;

Originally the troupes' actors were all men but nowadays men and women play together.&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt; It appears that there is a strong bond between audience and performers, so that it is very common for the story to unfold in a way that pleases the audiences or for the audience to be addressed directly. This is especially true for the joker, who is allowed to switch between the performance and the audience, adding a sense of open interaction. The audience is also drawn into the play by the need for their imagination. As likay troupes are itinerant and have no fixed venue, the makeshift stage and repertoire usually does not offer more than a bench (tiang) which allows the actors to play most scenes, and the rough setting of a palace garden and a forest. The audience has to listen carefully to the explanation of space and time by the actors or storyteller and imagine the scenery themselves.&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r4" /&gt;

== Costumes ==
[[File:Likay Thai Folk Dance 2221180664.jpg|thumb|Likay Make-Up]]

Likay is famous for its flamboyant costumes. Heavy make-up, from the darkest black eyeliner to the brightest red lipstick, and colorful, glittering, fake jewels for both men and women are standard. Responsible for most of the outfitting themselves, the actors not only bring their costumes but also create their own masks. For men, the costume includes colorful or golden stuffed knickerbockers, long white socks, blouses and vests with excessive ornaments, glittering earrings, and plumed headbands. The women wear clothes in both modern and traditional fashions of shining silk and satin.&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="r4" /&gt;

'''Marginalia''' (or '''apostils''') are marks made in the [[margin (typography)|margins]] of a [[book]] or other document. They may be scribbles, comments, [[gloss (annotation)|glosses (annotations)]], [[critique]]s, [[doodle]]s, or [[illuminated manuscript|illuminations]].

==Biblical manuscripts==
Biblical manuscripts have liturgical notes at the margin, for liturgical use. Numbers of texts' divisions are given at the margin (κεφάλαια, Ammonian Sections, [[Eusebian Canons]]). There are some scholia, corrections and other notes usually made later by hand in the margin. Marginalia may also be of relevance because many ancient or medieval writers of these marginalia may have had access to other relevant texts that, although they may have been widely copied at the time,  have since then been lost due to wars, prosecution or censorship. As such, they might give clues to an earlier, more widely known context of the extant form of the underlying text than is currently appreciated. For this reason, scholars of ancient texts usually try to find as many still existing manuscripts of the texts they are researching, because the notes scribbled in the margin might contain additional clues to the interpretation of these texts.

==History==
The [[scholia]] on classical manuscripts are the earliest known form of marginalia.

==Recent studies==
Marginalia can add to or detract from the value of an [[association copy]] of a book, depending on the author of the marginalia and on the book.

Catherine C. Marshall, doing research on the future of [[user interface]] design, has studied the phenomenon of user annotation of texts. She discovered that in several university departments, students would scour the piles of textbooks at used book dealers for consistently annotated copies. The students had a good appreciation for their predecessors' distillation of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.lib.uiowa.edu/hardinmd/2009/06/08/crowdsourcing-annotations-for-books-and-ebooks/ |title=Seeing the picture - Crowdsourcing annotations for books (and eBooks) |publisher=University of Iowa Libraries |work= Blog |accessdate=2011-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/~marshall/CCM-AJB.pdf |title=From Personal to Shared Annotations |format=PDF |publisher= Texas A&amp;M University | author= Cathy Marshall |accessdate=2011-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november08/gazan/11gazan.html |title=Social Annotations in Digital Library Collections |publisher=D-Lib Magazine |date=1998-03-24 |accessdate=2011-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the marginalia left behind by university students as they engage with library textbooks has also been a topic of interest to sociologists looking to understand the lived experience of being a university student.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/7593791/I_don_t_f_ing_care_Marginalia_and_the_textual_negotiation_of_an_academic_identity_by_university_students Attenborough, F.

The '''Mary Schenley Memorial Fountain''', also known as '''''A Song to Nature''''', is a 1918 landmark public sculpture in bronze and granite by [[Victor David Brenner]]. It sits in [[Schenley Plaza]] at the entrance to [[Schenley Park]] and directly in front of the [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s [[Frick Fine Arts Building]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]].  The fountain is designated as a contributing property to the [[Schenley Farms Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&amp;-format=d.html&amp;-lay=a&amp;-sortfield=issueid%3a%3aissuedate&amp;-sortorder=descend&amp;keywords=bellefield%20hall&amp;-max=50&amp;-recid=38544&amp;-find= University Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628170337/http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&amp;-format=d.html&amp;-lay=a&amp;-sortfield=issueid%3A%3Aissuedate&amp;-sortorder=descend&amp;keywords=bellefield%20hall&amp;-max=50&amp;-recid=38544&amp;-find= |date=2009-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of art comprises two major figures: a reclining [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], the [[Greek god]] of shepherds, and above him a female singer playing a [[lyre]]. From crevices along the fountain's rim four turtles spew water into the basin. An inscription on the pedestal reads, "A Song of Nature, Pan the Earth God Answers to the Harmony and Magic Tones Sung to the Lyre by Sweet Humanity." The basin of the fountain is 15 feet high, above which the figures rise another 15 feet.

The fountain honors [[Mary Schenley]]. In 1889, after intensive lobbying by [[Edward Manning Bigelow]], director of parks for the City of Pittsburgh, Schenley donated the land for the park named in her honor. Upon her death, Pittsburgh City Council sponsored a national competition for the memorial. The judges selected this design by Brenner, who is famous today for his design of the [[Penny (United States coin)|Lincoln cent]], which is still in circulation.

In June 2008, restoration efforts were begun that include repairs, cleaning, plumbing, paving, and landscaping.  A gift from the Benter Foundation will provide lighting for the fountain and plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/search/s_580089.html | title=Repairs under way on Schenley fountain | publisher = Pittsburgh Tribune-Review | date=2008-07-30 | accessdate=2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Oil sketch''' or '''oil study''' is an artwork made primarily in [[oil paint]] in preparation for a larger, finished work. Originally these were created as preparatory studies or '''[[modello|modelli]]''', especially so as to gain approval for the design of a larger commissioned painting. They were also used as designs for specialists in other media, such as [[printmaking]] or [[tapestry]], to follow. Later they were produced as independent works, often with no thought of being expanded into a full-size painting.

The [[sketch (drawing)|usual medium]] for ''modelli'' was the [[drawing]], but an oil sketch, even if done in a limited range of colours, could better suggest the tone of the projected work. It is also possible to more fully convey the flow and energy of a composition in paint. For a painter with exceptional technique, the production of an oil sketch may be as rapid as that of a drawing, and many practitioners had superb brush skills. In its rapidity of execution the oil sketch may be used not only to express movement and transient effects of light and color, its gestural nature may even represent a mimetic parallel to the action of the subject.

One of the earliest artists to produce oil sketches was [[Polidoro da Caravaggio]], a fine draftsman and pupil of [[Raphael]], but not one who had passed through the traditional Florentine training, with its emphasis on drawing.  His are all apparently related to works later done on a larger scale, and are themselves relatively large and on [[panel painting|panel]], with examples in the [[National Gallery, London]][https://web.archive.org/web/20070303121519/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG6594] and [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] being 75 and 65&amp;nbsp;cm tall respectively.  Sometimes a number of sketches for the same composition have survived.
[[Image:Théodore Géricault nu masculino.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Oil study of a male nude by [[Géricault]]]]
In the early 17th century the oil sketch became widely used, as it was suited to conveying the drama of [[Baroque painting|Baroque art]].  [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] made great use of them, as working studies, and as ''modelli'' for clients, his own assistants, engravers and tapestry-makers.  Their degree of finish varies accordingly.  Rubens' working practices influenced others, such as [[Anthony van Dyck]], who did not normally use oil sketches for the portraits that were the bulk of his output, but did for his [[old master print|print]] series the ''Iconographie'', and for other works such as a projected series of tapestries and some religious paintings. The ''[[Magistrate of Brussels]]'', recognised in England in 2013, may be a Van Dyck portrait oil sketch. 

Perhaps the first to produce oil sketches as independent works was [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], an amazingly fecund generator of compositions on a relatively small range of subjects.  He grew up and trained in [[Genoa]], and apparently had contact with both Rubens and Van Dyck during their stays there.  He produced a large number of small works, mostly on paper, in a mixture of mediums - drawings or [[gouache]]s finished in oil, oils with pen details - in fact, most possible permutations.  Detail is typically restricted to a few key points, with much of the subject conveyed in impressionistic fashion.  By this time a collectors' market for studies in drawing was well developed, and there was appreciation of their energy and freedom. Castiglione's sketches to some extent seem to trade off this appreciation, and look more unfinished and offhand than they actually are - a concept with a great future. 

A systematic producer of small ''modelli'' sketches on canvas with a high degree of finish was the 18th century [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], whose superb technique is often shown at its best in reducing a huge [[altarpiece]] to a lively but precise rendering at this small scale. At roughly the same time [[Jean Fragonard]] was producing a series of virtuosic ''Figures de fantaisie'', half-length portraits of imaginary subjects, purporting to have been painted in an hour.&lt;ref&gt;Brettell, Richard R.: ''Impression: Painting Quickly in France'', pages 31–2. Yale University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:John Constable 025.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[John Constable]], 1827, 22 × 31 cm]]

By the 19th century oil sketches, often referred to as "oil studies" if from this period, had become very common, both as preparatory works, and for their own sake. The popularity of the oil sketch engendered the need to formulate distinctions. The ''esquisse'', or oil sketch, tended to be inspirational or imaginative, often originating in literature or art; the ''etude'', or study, tended to represent an observation of nature, painted from life. In academic painting the oil sketch took the form of the ''croquis'', a small and gestural compositional study, and the ''ébauche'', a dynamic laying-in of paint on the full-scale canvas, a temporary stage of the painting eventually leading to greater elaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Brettell, pages 31–9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[John Constable]] made extensive use of sketches for his landscapes, both of intimate scale, often in a [[sketchbook]] on paper, and in full-scale sketches for his largest "six-footers", which he used to refine his compositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/constable/ Tate Britain exhibition showing Constable's large landscapes along with their full-size oil sketches]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:Composition study for the portrait of professor gross thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Eakins]], Sketch for [[The Gross Clinic]].]][[image:Study for swimming thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|left|Thomas Eakins, 1884 ''Swimming Hole sketch'', [[oil paint|oil]] on [[fiberboard]] mounted on fiberboard, 22.1 × 27 cm., 8{{fraction|3|4}} × 10{{fraction|3|4}} inches, [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], [[Washington, D.C..]]]][[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Géricault]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] and [[Degas]] are other artists who often used them. For some oil sketches Degas painted in ''essence'', a technique by which the oil had been all but removed from the pigment, so that the artist was virtually drawing with pure paint. [[Seurat]] made many careful small oil sketches for his larger works. However, with the advent of [[Impressionism]], and then [[Modernism]], the practice of preparatory drawing and painting tended to decline. The abandonment by many artists of a high level of detail and finish in favor of a more [[painterly]] and spontaneous approach, reduced the distinction between a detailed sketch and a finished painting.  Sketches by Rubens or Tiepolo, for example, are at least as highly finished as many 20th century oil paintings.  Many artists, especially those working in more traditional styles, still use oil sketches today.  [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] is an example of an artist who called many of his most important, and largest, finished works "studies": examples are his [[Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion]] [[Tate Britain]], or his ''Study from Pope Innocent X'', auctioned in 2007 for $52.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0516/baconf.html RTE story &amp; picture]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toy description==
The puppies were a variety of plush stuffed dog dolls with floppy ears and droopy eyes. They came in a variety of colors (gray, brown, white), some with spots. Each one came in a cardboard case shaped like a [[doghouse]] with an "adoption" certificate.&lt;ref name=Tubulartoys /&gt; The tagline was "Loveable Huggable". Smaller versions were also created (approximately 5 inches (13&amp;nbsp;cm) long), and a line of cats called '''Pound Pur-r-ries''' was also released. Each authentic toy puppy had a heart-shaped or a bone (on the very first edition puppies) emblem near its tail that sported a "PP" logo with either a dog (Puppies) or cat (Purries) peeking above it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-02-21/news/vw-10463_1_bear-talk/2 |title=Buyers Have an Early Adventure in Toyland : Industry Show Previews Talking Teddy Bears, Cuddly Dolls, More Rambos - Page 2 - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1986-02-21 |accessdate=2013-11-28 |first=John |last=Dreyfuss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toy history==
[[File:Child with Pound Puppies toy.png|thumb|right|A child holds up a Pound Puppies toy]]
The toys were created by Mike Bowling in 1984.&lt;ref name=Townsend /&gt; The first puppies were sold by [[Irwin Toy]] in Toronto, Canada.&lt;ref name=Tubulartoys /&gt; After Irwin, the line was produced by [[Tonka]] which introduced them to the US market.

In 1987, [[Hardee's]] restaurants also offered a series of Pound Puppies with their Children's Meals. Other products besides stuffed toys were made such as [[Little Golden Books]], coloring books and miniature figurines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghostofthedoll.co.uk/poundpuppies-tonka-other.htm Toy photos]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pound Puppies continued to be popular in the early 1990s. The toys were produced again in the early 2000s and included specific breeds of dog (as opposed to a generic model) along with barking sounds and movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/012401/nen_5196452.shtml |title=Pound Puppies to be back in stores again |publisher=Florida Times-Union |date=January 24, 2001 |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The toyline was discontinued in 2002; however, the 2010 series of the same name was produced by Hasbro Studios and aired on The Hub in 2010.

The toyline was relaunched in 2014 by Funrise and they are still available in stores today.

==TV special==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
{{main|Pound Puppies (TV special)}}

A TV special based on the toyline was released in October 1985 by [[Hanna-Barbera]]. It ran in syndication, paired with ''[[Star Fairies]]''. In the special, a female dog named Violet Vanderfeller is dognapped and ends up at the city pound. The pound puppies attempt to and end up succeeding in reuniting Violet with her family. The special was released in 1986 on [[VHS]] by [[Family Home Entertainment]] and is also available on DVD. The DVD comes with certain Pound Puppies toys.

==TV series==

===1986 TV series===
{{main|Pound Puppies (1986 TV series)}}

After the TV special became successful, [[Hanna-Barbera]] gained the rights to create an animated TV series. The series was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 1986 to February 1989. While the series was loosely based on the special, it made no mention of the character Violet. When it was renewed for a second season, there were major style differences and the series was retitled ''All New Pound Puppies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=CHARLES SOLOMON |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-09/entertainment/ca-8568_1_cartoon-series |title=Kidvid Reviews : Cartoon Debuts Are All Drawn Out – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com/2 |date=1987-10-09 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 TV series===
{{main|Pound Puppies (2010 TV series)}}

Another television series, this time produced for [[Hasbro Studios]], was premiered on the Hub Network (now [[Discovery Family]]; partly owned by Hasbro since its launch) on 10 October 2010, the channel's launch date. The characters are based on the current version of the Puppies which Hasbro released in the summer of 2012. In addition, there was an online website where one could download a Pound Puppies adoption certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pound Puppies on TV.com, forum discussion "Toys" |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/pound-puppies/forums/toys-108544-3358884/|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July 2012, ''Pound Puppies'' was one of four original animated series from The Hub to win the [[CINE|CINE Golden Eagle Award]] for its high quality production and storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HubWorld.com press release|url=http://www.hubworld.com/hub-headlines-golden-eagle-awards-2012|accessdate=11 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020112156/http://www.hubworld.com/hub-headlines-golden-eagle-awards-2012|archivedate=20 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, the season one episode "I Never Barked for My Father" was awarded the [[Humanitas Prize]] for excellence in writing for children's television animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE HUB TV NETWORK ORIGINAL SERIES ‘POUND PUPPIES,’ FROM HASBRO STUDIOS, HONORED WITH HUMANITAS PRIZE|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/08/08/the-hub-tv-network-original-series-pound-puppies-from-hasbro-studios-honored-with-humanitas-prize/144309/|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feature film==
{{main|Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw}}
In [[1988 in film|1988]], [[TriStar Pictures]] released a Pound Puppies movie titled ''[[Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw]]''. It was produced by [[Atlantic Releasing]], [[Carolco]], [[Family Home Entertainment]] and [[The Kushner-Locke Company|Kushner-Locke]] with [[Michael Maltese|The Maltese Companies]].

===Critical and box office reception===

The film was panned by critics, and poorly received at the box office. Shoddy animation, character inconsistencies, and a color palette that differed from the show's were among the chief complaints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Charles Solomon |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-03-26/entertainment/ca-25_1_pound-puppies |title=MOVIE REVIEWS : Producers Should Curb These Dog Cartoons – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1988-03-26 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was also not part of the show's continuity.

Fans were also confused by the apparent romantic pairing of Nose Marie and Cooler, which contradicted events that had taken place in the first season of the series.  In addition, the movie is set in the 1950s with the story being narrated by Whopper, who in the present day is now an older dog who tells the story to his nephew and niece.

[[File:Redeyephotographynetwork.jpg|thumb|The Redeye Logo]]'''Redeye, The Photography Network''' is a UK-based [[photography]] network with around 7000 subscribers, the majority of whom are full- or part-time photographers, artists and other creatives. Based in [[Manchester]], it works with a large number of partner organisations such as galleries, universities and other photographic and arts organisations across the country to deliver its events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.look2011.co.uk/captureliverpool/&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "a leader among a strengthening body of nationally significant photography-focused organisations that address career development for practitioners".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.artsprofessional.co.uk/magazine/view.cfm?issue=134&amp;id=3132 Focus on Photography - Coming into focus]", Arts Professional. ''Requires registration.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
Redeye was created in 1998 by a group of photographers who met in [[Manchester]] to discuss research into what the region's practitioners needed in regard to North West Arts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redeye.org.uk/redeye/about.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.a-n.co.uk/arts_organisers/jobs_and_opps/employer_index/single/36505&lt;/ref&gt; With many facilities in demand such as darkrooms, exhibition spaces and help with legal matters, they decided that most photographers needed an environment in which they could network and learn from each other. By the beginning of 1999 these meetings had become regular. Some of the group, chaired by Len Grant, volunteered to help run the organisation. The award-winning&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.connectinghistories.org.uk/other%20collections/paul_hill.asp Paul Hill]", Connecting History (Birmingham City Archives ''et al.'').&lt;/ref&gt; British photographer Paul Hill gave the first of six talks that launched Redeye events in October 1999. The first paid member of staff was appointed in 2001, and a co-ordinator was selected the next year.

== Non-profit status ==

Redeye receives funding support from the [[Arts Council England|Arts Council of England]]. In March 2011 it received funding for the next four years.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/rfo/redeye-photography-network/ Redeye Photography Network]", Arts Council England.&lt;/ref&gt; It also has project funding from ACE, RALP, CIDS, AGMA and a number of other organisations.

In line with its manifesto, Redeye organises various events every year including talks each year by established photographers and workshops running at beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. Monthly portfolio viewing and advice sessions are held with [[curator]]s, picture editors and experienced photographers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.manchestersocieties.org/societies_detail.php?soc_id=12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theartguide.co.uk/profiles/?profile=320&lt;/ref&gt; Redeye also works in partnership with QUAD, Derby&lt;ref&gt;http://www.derbyquad.co.uk/events-archive/pg&lt;/ref&gt; and The Buy Art Fair,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buyartfair.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; held annually in Manchester.

'''Restless Dance Theatre''' is a [[dance theatre]] company based in the [[South Australia]]n capital of [[Adelaide]]. Founded in 1991, Restless works with people with and without [[disability]] to collaboratively create inclusive dance theatre informed by disability. The company presents dance theatre works in multiple mediums to diverse audiences. Restless has an extensive workshop program for all ages. The company, originally called '''Restless Dance Company''', changed its name to Restless Dance Theatre in 2008.{{sfn|Annual Report|2008|p=4}} 
 

==The Company==
The Restless Dance Company was founded in 1991 by Sally Chance and Tania Rose and was incorporated in 1996.{{sfn|Annual Report|2008|p=2}} The current Artistic Director is Michelle Ryan who has been the Artistic Director since January 2013.&lt;ref name="RDT-People"/&gt;

As an inclusive dance company, the work is informed by disability but not about disability. Restless has developed a way of working where participants are given a series of creative challenges and asked to respond in movement. Dance sequences are then built up from their responses. This produces unique and distinctive dance through a process that nurtures the creative voices of the dancers.

The guiding values which underpin the company’s work are:
* Vision: Restless artists enliven and diversify Australian dance.
* Purpose: Restless Dance Theatre collaboratively creates inclusive work informed by disability.
* Mission: Present unexpectedly real dance theatre works in multiple mediums to diverse audiences nationally and internationally.

==Awards==
The company received a Ruby Award in 2010 for sustained contribution by an organisation. Restless was nominated for an Australian Dance Award for "Salt" in 2015. The company won the award for Outstanding Achievement in Youth or Community Dance at the 2010 [[Australian Dance Awards]] for ''Bedroom Dancing''.&lt;ref name="Northover-2010"/&gt;
The Necessary Games film triptych has received multiple awards both nationally and internationally.
 
==Reviews==
"Restless Dance is one of a handful of Australian companies which defy pigeon-holing. The work they do with performers of differing physical and intellectual abilities is useful and heart-warming : but the point is that the work itself is exceptionally beautiful and highly skilled, often funny, and always moving."
Robyn Archer

"Restless changes attitudes to disability every time it performs."
Noel Jordan (Artistic Director, Imaginate Festival, Edinburgh)

"It’s an amazing company of dancers and performers. But what you don’t see on stage is disability, you just see an extraordinary group of human beings dancing with such heart and such talent."
Neil Armfield (Adelaide Festival co-director)

“5 STARS. Innovative, potent, bold and beautiful, Intimate Space is an extraordinary and highly entertaining experience.”
Limelight, March 2017

In The Balance…."Unbearably beautiful solos and duets."
Peter Burdon, Advertiser, June 2016

Rowling launches Harry Potter book club online &amp;#124; Reuters|work=reuters.com|accessdate=18 October 2012|first=Patricia|last=Reaney|date=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholastic is the world's largest publisher and distributor of children's books and a leader in print and digital educational materials for pre-K to grade 12.

In addition to ''Harry Potter'' and ''The Hunger Games'', the company is known for its school book clubs and book fairs, classroom magazines such as ''Scholastic News'', and popular book series: ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', ''[[Goosebumps]]'', ''[[The Magic School Bus]]'', ''[[Captain Underpants]]'', ''[[Animorphs]]'', and ''[[I Spy (Scholastic)|I Spy]]''. Scholastic also publishes instructional reading and writing programs, and offers professional learning and consultancy services for school improvement. Clifford the Big Red Dog serves as the mascot for Scholastic.

==History==
In 1920, Maurice R. "Robbie" Robinson founded the business he named Scholastic Publishing Company in his hometown of [[Wilkinsburg]], right outside [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. As a publisher of youth magazines, the first publication was ''The Western Pennsylvania Scholastic.'' It covered high school sports and social activities and debuted on October 22, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/aboutscholastic/peoplehistory.htm |title=About Scholastic People And History |publisher=Scholastic.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Scholastic published its first book, ''Saplings'', a collection of selected student writings by winners of the Scholastic Writing Awards.

For many years the company continued its focus on serving the youth market, publishing low-cost magazines and later paperback books. The company continued under the name Scholastic Magazines throughout the 1970s.

After World War II, cheap paperback books became available. In 1948, Scholastic entered the school book club business with its division T.A.B., or Teen Age Book Club, offering classic titles priced at 25 [[US$|cents]].

In 1957, Scholastic established its first international subsidiary in Toronto [[Scholastic Canada]], later moving to [[Markham, Ontario]].

By the 1960s, international publishing locations were added in England (1964), New Zealand (1964) and Sydney (1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.shareholder.com/sec/viewerContent.aspx?companyid=ABEA-28S6DN&amp;docid=1973771 |website= |title=United States Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K Annual Report pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities exchange Act of 1934 For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2002 Commission File No. 0-19860: Scholastic Corporation |pages=6, 7 |date=2002 |publisher= |accessdate=12 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Richard "Dick" Robinson, the son of founder M. R. Robinson, became president of Scholastic Inc. Named chief executive officer in 1975 and chairman in 1982, he remains in these positions.

During the 1970s, Scholastic was well known for Scholastic Book Clubs, a book purchasing service delivered through schools, and magazine publications aimed at youths: ''Wow'' (preschoolers and elementary schoolers), ''[[Dynamite (magazine)|Dynamite]]'' (pre-teens), and ''Bananas'' (teens). Scholastic now publishes 33 classroom magazines including ''Scholastic News'', ''Action'', ''Scope'', ''[[Storyworks]]'', ''SuperScience'', ''Science World'', ''Math'' and more, that reach 14 million readers.

The Scholastic Education business sells instructional reading and writing programs such as Guided and leveled reading and print and digital classroom magazines, along with professional learning programs and consulting/training on Family &amp; Community Engagement and Learning Supports. Classroom Magazines have 15 million subscribers.

During the mid-1990s, Scholastic entered the educational technology market, working with Dr. Ted Hasselbring of Vanderbilt University to create READ 180, a blended-learning, reading intervention program for students in grades 4 through 12 who are two or more grades below grade level.  Since then, READ 180 has been listed in the What Works Clearinghouse and has a record of positive results in a wide range of efficacy studies with various student populations, including special education students and English language learners.  Scholastic Education has since created SYSTEM 44, a technology-based phonics program for students in grades 3 through 12, iREAD, a supplemental educational technology program for grades K-2, MATH 180, mathematics intervention for middle school, and FasttMath, a technology based program to teach basic math facts.  The EdTech and Services business was sold to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 2015 for $575 million.

To appeal to American children, in 1997, Scholastic (through [[Arthur A. Levine Books]]) purchased the US publication rights to the first ''[[Harry Potter]]'' book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', which was renamed ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone''. It continues to publish ''Harry Potter'' books, each title a best seller.

Scholastic's growth has continued by acquiring other media companies. In February 2012, it bought [[Weekly Reader Publishing]] from [[Reader's Digest Association]], and announced in July that year that it planned to discontinue separate issues of ''[[Weekly Reader]]'' magazines after more than a century of publication, and co-branded the magazines as "Scholastic News/Weekly Reader".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/scholastic-to-end-independent-publication-of-weekly-reader.html |title=Scholastic to End Independent Publication of Weekly Reader – Bloomberg |work=bloomberg.com|accessdate=16 November 2012 |date=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other acquisitions include [[Klutz Press|Klutz]] in 2002,   and the reference publisher [[Grolier]], which publishes the ''[[Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia]]'' and ''[[The New Book of Knowledge]]'' in 2000 and [[Weston Woods Studios]] in 1996. In 2015, Scholastic acquired Troubadour, Ltd. in the U.K.

During the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], Scholastic organized the [[Scholastic News Kids Press Corps]], which today includes more than 30 national and International kid reporters ages 10–14.

==The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards==
Founded in 1923 by Maurice R. Robinson, [[The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards]], administered by the [[Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers]], have motivated more than 13 million students, recognized more than 9 million young artists and writers, and provided more than $25 million in awards and scholarships. These Awards have been the largest source of scholarship funding for teenage artists and writers, and the nation's longest-running, most prestigious art and writing awards.

In the U.S.A, the process begins as young artists and writers submit creative works to the Alliance's regional affiliates. The most outstanding works of art and writing (Gold Key and Silver Key winners) from each region are forwarded to the Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers in New York City to be reviewed on a national level. Panels of professional jurors select the national award recipients. Regional awards are administered by a network of nearly 100 affiliates that include school systems and school boards, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, foundations, arts agencies, businesses, libraries, museums, teacher councils and institutions of higher education, which share a commitment to identifying emerging local artists and writers.

The Awards recognize written and artistic works in 30 categories, including Architecture, Comic Art, Ceramics &amp; Glass, Digital Art, Design, Drawing, Fashion, Film &amp; Animation, Jewelry, Mixed Media, Painting, Photography, Printmaking, Sculpture, Video Games, Art Portfolio, Photography Portfolio, Dramatic Script, Humor, Journalism, Personal Essay/Memoir, Persuasive Writing, Poetry, Novel Writing, Science Fiction/Fantasy, Short Story, Short, Short Story, General Writing Portfolio, Nonfiction Portfolio, and Creativity &amp; Citizenship.

Recipients of The Scholastic Art and Writing Awards include [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Richard Avedon]], [[Harry Bertoia]], [[Mel Bochner]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Paul Brooks Davis|Paul Davis]], [[Frances Farmer]], [[Red Grooms]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Bernard Malamud]], [[Joyce Maynard]], [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Peter S. Beagle]], [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Jean Stafford]], Mozelle Thompson, [[Ned Vizzini]], [[Kay WalkingStick]], [[Andy Warhol]], and [[Charlie White (artist)|Charles White,]] all of whom won when they were in high school.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== James Patterson Pledge ==
In March 2018, author [[James Patterson]] announced an increase in his annual donations for classroom libraries from $1.75 million to $2 million, in a program run in conjunction with the Scholastic Book Clubs. Patterson is also distributing 4,000 gifts of $500 each to teachers around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/mar/19/james-patterson-donating-2-million-to-classroom-li/|title=James Patterson donating $2 million to classroom libraries|work=Spokesman.com|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book clubs==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Scholastic [[Book sales club|book clubs]] are offered at schools in many countries. Typically, teachers administer the program to the students in their own classes, but in some cases, the program is administered by a central contact for the entire school. Within Scholastic, Reading Clubs is a separate unit (compared to, e.g., Education). Reading clubs are arranged by age/grade.

Scholastic also offers a host of specialty book club fliers including '''Club Leo''' (Spanish language for grades K–8), and '''Click''' (Computer games and media for all ages).

Scholastic typically offers participating schools and classrooms 1 "point" for every dollar (or local unit of currency) of products ordered. Additional points may be earned during special promotion times, such as the beginning of the school year. Points may then be redeemed for books and school supplies at a rate of approximately 20 points to the dollar. At minimum, schools earn 5% of book orders in free products. With special promotions, return rate can be higher (15–100%).

==Scholastic Parents Media==
Scholastic Parents Media publishes the [[Scholastic Parent &amp; Children Magazine]]. The group also specializes in online advertising sales and custom programs designed for parents and children ages 0–6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.scholastic.com/browse/parentchild.jsp |title=Parent &amp; Child Magazine |publisher=Scholastic.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Scholastic has been criticized for inappropriately marketing to children. Also, Scholastic now requires parents to submit children's names with birth dates to place online orders, creating controversy. A significant number of titles carried have strong media tie-ins and are considered relatively short in literary and artistic merit by some critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/11/20/taking_consumerism_out_of_school_book_fairs/ |title='&amp;#39;Boston Globe'&amp;#39; |publisher=Boston.com |date=2006-11-20 |accessdate=2014-03-12 |first=Barbara F. |last=Meltz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer groups have also attacked Scholastic for selling too many toys and video games to children, rather than focusing on just books. &lt;!--Critics have noted that "lesson plan" books published by Scholastic are too frequently written by authors lacking classroom experience.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.topix.com/content/prweb/2010/03/a-new-math-art-activity-book-thats-actually-written-by-a-teacher-4&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; 
In July, 2005, Scholastic determined that certain leases previously accounted for as operating leases should have been accounted for as capital leases. The cumulative effect, if recorded in the current year, would be material. As a result, it decided to restate its financial statements.

'''Shapurgala''' ({{lang-az|'''Şapurqala'''}}) is a fortress located on the left bank of Nakhchivanay, near the village with the same name in [[Shahbuz District]] of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]].

==Research==
The fortress is located on a high mountain, surrounded by steep cliffs. It was registered as an archeological monument in 1990. The area of the fortress is 1,300 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. There is a [[Pir (Zoroastrianism)|Pir]] on the road to the fortress. In the area above the Pir, remains of a destroyed construction and pink colored clay dish fragments were encountered.&lt;ref name="shahbuz"/&gt;

In the central part of the fortress researchers came across construction remnants, baked bricks, pink clay plates and remains of grain stones and fireplaces.&lt;ref name="shahbuz"/&gt; The findings indicate that life in Shapurgala lasted from the first century AD to the XV-XVI centuries.&lt;ref name="haqqinda"&gt;{{cite web|title= SHapurqala|url= https://haqqinda.az/Azərbaycan+qalalarının+siyahısı/41295-SHapurqala.html|publisher= haqqinda.az|language= az|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used as a guard station for defensive purposes.&lt;ref name="shahbuz"/&gt;

==Architectural features==
The fortress is located in a polygonal-shaped area. The tallest place of the pitch is the tallest cliff in the south-east. Inside the cliff a rectangular room is drilled with 4x3.6 m of area. The burnt bricks of the size of 19x19x5 cm were found inside the room, a rhomb shaped niche was made on the wall of the fortress, and the wall under the niche was made in semi-circular form.&lt;ref name="shahbuz"&gt;Ə.

[[File:Skopje 2014 - Museum of the Macedonian Struggle and National Theatre.JPG|thumb|500px|View of the buildings finished after the 1963 earthquake (2014).]]
'''Skopje 2014''' ({{lang-mk|Скопје 2014}}) is a project financed by the [[Government of the Republic of Macedonia]], with the main ideology being based on that of the then-ruling party [[VMRO-DPMNE]],&lt;ref&gt;EastWest Institute (2000). Jonathan P. Stein, ed. The Politics of National Minority Participation in Post-Communist Europe: State-Building, Democracy, and Ethnic Mobilization. M.E. Sharpe. p. 91. {{ISBN|978-0-7656-0528-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with the purpose of giving the capital [[Skopje]] a more classical appeal. The project, officially announced in 2010, consists mainly of the construction of colleges, museums and government buildings, as well as the erection of monuments depicting historical figures from the [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]]. Around 20 buildings and over 40 monuments are planned to be constructed as part of the project.&lt;ref name="Marusic2" /&gt; 

In fact this political project is [[nation-building]] one and tries to impose a new [[Macedonian historiography|revisionist narrative of the Macedonian history]], promoting  Macedonian identity, with  unbroken continuity from the antiquity over the middle ages to the modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Janev, G. (2015). ‘Skopje 2014’: erasing memories, building history. In M. Couroucli, &amp; T. Marinov (Eds.), Balkan heritages: Negotiating history and culture (pp. 111-130). Taylor &amp; Francis, 2017, {{ISBN|1134800754}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Skopje 2014 project has been criticized by various groups since the time it was first announced for constructing nationalistic [[Historicism (art)|historicist]] [[kitsch]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Couroucli and Tchavdar Marinov eds., Balkan Heritages: Negotiating History and Culture, British School at Athens - Modern Greek and Byzantine Studies, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2017, {{ISBN|1134800754}}, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Skopje 2014 has also generated controversy for its cost, for which estimates range from 80 to 500 million euros.&lt;ref name="Bugjevac"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globusmagazin.com.mk/?ItemID=C18D740B2343534A8B173AAD06639F3A|title=СКОПЈЕ ЌЕ УМРЕ ОД  НЕВКУС|last=Bugjevac|first=Dejan|year=2007|work=Globus|language=Macedonian|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koteska"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.artmargins.com/index.php/2-articles/655-troubles-with-history-skopje-2014|title=Troubles with History: Skopje 2014|last=Koteska|first=Jasna|date=29 December 2011|work=Art Margins Online|accessdate=8 June 2012|location=Republic of Macedonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Skopje 2014 project encompasses the construction, from 2010 to 2014, of 136 structures built at a cost of more than US$700 million.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times International Edition, October 14, 2016, pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, the authorities and institutions of the country announced the halt of the project and then set up a Commission for envisaging the removal of its controversial monuments and statues.{{Cn|date=October 2018}}

==Background==
[[File:Skopje-razglednica 014.jpg|thumb|250px|The National Theatre and Kale Fortress before the 1963 earthquake]]
[[File:Wodno.jpg|thumb|250px|View toward [[Macedonia Square, Skopje|Macedonia Square]] from the [[Stone Bridge (Skopje)|Stone Bridge]] in July 2011. Visible are the statues of Dame Gruev, Goce Delčev, Tsar Samuil, and the under construction Warrior on a Horse monument]]

The [[1963 Skopje earthquake]] destroyed approximately 80% of the city, including most of the neoclassical buildings in the central part of Skopje.&lt;ref name="MRT"&gt;[http://www.mrt.com.mk/en//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3316&amp;Itemid=27 Marking the 44th anniversary of the catastrophic 1963 Skopje earthquake] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210952/http://www.mrt.com.mk/en//index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3316&amp;Itemid=27 |date=2007-09-30 }} [[Macedonian Radio-Television|MRT]], Thursday, 26 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The rebuilding that followed saw the construction of mostly plain [[modernist architecture]]. This is one of the reasons given by the VMRO-DPMNE government for the necessity of the project, to give Skopje a more monumental and visually pleasing image. Another reason is to restore the missing sense of national pride and create a more metropolitan atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Marusic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/gallery/skopje-2014|title=Skopje 2014: The new face of Macedonia, updated|last=Marusic|first=Siniša|date=11 May 2012|publisher=BalkanInsight|accessdate=27 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech at the opening of [[Porta Macedonia]] in January 2012, then Prime Minister [[Nikola Gruevski]] stated that Skopje 2014 was his idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/20045/45/|title=PM Gruevski: Yes, Skopje 2014 was my Idea|date=7 January 2012|publisher=MINA|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
{{see also|Antiquization}}
The Skopje 2014 project has been criticized by various groups since the time it was first announced. The cost of the project is estimated at anywhere from 80 to more than 500 million euros&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/04/world/europe/macedonia-skopje-2014/index.html Is Macedonia's capital being turned into a theme park?], CNN, October 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/macedonian-culture-strategy-milestone-or-wish-list  Macedonian Culture Strategy: Milestone or Wish List?], BalkanInsight, 15 Nov 12&lt;/ref&gt; and is seen by many as a waste of resources in a country with high unemployment and poverty. The project is also believed by critics to be a distraction from these problems.&lt;ref name="Marusic" /&gt;

The [[Social Democratic Union of Macedonia]], the main opposition party, opposes the project and has alleged that the monuments could have cost six to ten times less than what the government paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skopjediem.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9407:sdsm-allegations-at-government-on-skopje-2014-project-&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=81|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104174531/http://www.skopjediem.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9407:sdsm-allegations-at-government-on-skopje-2014-project-&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=81|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 January 2013|title=SDSM Allegations at Government on Skopje 2014 Project|date=30 March 2011|publisher=SkopjeDiem|accessdate=30 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is seen as a part of the government's "antiquisation" policy, in which the country seeks to claim [[Ancient Macedonians|ancient Macedonian]] figures like [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon]] for itself. The timing of the project, following the country's non-invitation to NATO due to its continued [[Macedonia naming dispute|naming dispute]] with [[Greece]], has led to speculation that it is retaliation or an attempt to put pressure on Greece.&lt;ref name="Georgievski"&gt;''Ghosts of the past endanger Macedonia's future''. Boris Georgievski, BalkanInsight, October 27, 2009 [http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/ghosts-of-the-past-endanger-macedonia-s-future].&lt;/ref&gt; Some residents see the scheme as the embodiment of nationalism by a conservative government focused as much on giving the metropolis a facelift as changing the nation's history and have described it as a mini-[[Las Vegas]]&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/14/alexander-great-macedonia-warrior-horse Macedonia statue: Alexander the Great or a warrior on a horse?], Sunday 14 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; while others appreciate its classical nod to the past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.com/2011/05/05/the-changing-face-of-skopje/ The Changing Face of Skopje], Euronews.com, May 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sam Vaknin]], a former adviser to Nikola Gruevski, has stated that the project is not anti-Greek or anti-Bulgarian, but anti-Albanian. In an interview, he said "Antiquisation has a double goal, which is to marginalise the Albanians and create an identity that will not allow Albanians to become Macedonians."&lt;ref name="Georgievski" /&gt; The project, however, later included depictions of ethnic Albanians in the monuments including [[Nexhat Agolli]], [[Josif Bageri]], and [[Pjetër Bogdani]], as well as others on the [[Art Bridge]], and includes the construction of [[Skanderbeg Square (Skopje)|Skanderbeg Square]].

Architects have criticized the aesthetics of the project and believe the money could have been spent on constructing modern buildings.&lt;ref name="Marusic" /&gt; It has also been described as nationalist [[kitsch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://balkans.courriers.info/spip.php?page=dossier&amp;id_article=18171|title=Macédoine : Skopje 2014, kitsch nationaliste et foire aux antiquités|year=2012|publisher=Le Courrier des Balkans|language=French|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which "brings unknown history" to the citizens&lt;ref&gt;Borian Jovanovski Al Jazeera, 18 March 2015, [http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2015/03/macedonia-facade-150318135440964.html]: "Talking about this project Skopje 2014, yes it's damaging to inter-ethnic relations, it's not reflecting the multi-cultural society that Macedonia is. But on the other hand you have an Albanian party in the government - and they agree - so in a way they have responsibility for what's going on too. It's obvious that it is damaging inter-ethnic relations which are anyway fragile and damaging Macedonian national identity too because it brings us to history that is unknown to us, in which we are a kind of successor to Alexander the Great. This is not true because Alexander the Great is famous because he enlarged the Hellenic culture. We are Slavs who are not Hellenic at all."&lt;/ref&gt; and current prime minister [[Zoran Zaev]] has labeled it an "idiotic project".&lt;ref&gt;Zoran Zaev, Süddeutsche Zeitung, 27 December 2016, [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/mazedonien-hinter-neuen-fassaden-1.3311464]: "Mit dem idiotischen Skopje-2014-Projekt und der zusammenhängenden Pseudo-Geschichtsschreibung, die Alexander den Großen für Mazedonien reklamiert, haben wir nicht nur Griechenland provoziert, sondern auch viel internationale Unterstützung für unsere Position verloren." (English translation: With the idiotic Skopje 2014 project and the related pseudo-historiography that claims Alexander the Great for Macedonia, we have not only provoked Greece, but also lost much international support for our position.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018===
In late February 2018, the government and institutions of the Republic of Macedonia announced the halt of the Skopje 2014 program and begun removing its [[Macedonian nationalism|controversial]] monuments and statues. The [[Ministry of Culture (Macedonia)|Macedonian Ministry of Culture]] also has set up a Commission to envisage the possibility of removing the rest of them, such as of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon]]. As a first step, the monument of [[Andon Kyoseto]] was dismantled, as one of the mostly disputed of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mia.mk/EN/Inside/RenderSingleNews/289/134124689/|title=City of Skopje starting to take action on Skopje 2014 project: Mayor|publisher=Macedonian Information Agency|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkaneu.com/a-skopje-2014-monument-is-removed/|title=A “Skopje 2014” monument is removed|publisher=IBNA|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.euscoop.com/en/2018/2/22/statue-removed-macedonia|title=Macedonia Removes the Skopje 2014 Statue of Andon Kyoseto|publisher=EUscoop|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amna.gr/en/article/232954/Skopje-starts-removal-of-irredentist-statues-put-up-by-Gruevski-government|title=Skopje starts removal of 'irredentist' statues put up by Gruevski government|publisher=AMNA|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkaneu.com/removal-of-monuments-in-skopje-whose-turn-is-next/|title=Removal of monuments in Skopje, whose turn is next?|publisher=IBNA|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.protothema.gr/skopje-authorities-start-to-tear-down-nationalistic-statues/|title=Skopje authorities start to tear down nationalistic statues|publisher=Proto Thema|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/macedonia-removes-divisive-court-statue-02-22-2018|title=Divisive Revolutionary's Statue Vanishes from Macedonian Capital|publisher=BIRN|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018 the Macedonian Government announced that the monuments would be renamed and marked with inscriptions honouring Greek-Macedonian friendship. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/divisive-skopje-2014-landmarks-find-new-purpose-06-14-2018|title=Macedonia to Rename Divisive Statues that Irked Greece|publisher=BIRN|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plans==

===Bridges===

====New bridge constructions====

=====Art Bridge=====

{{main|Art Bridge}}

The Skopje 2014 project calls for two new pedestrian bridges to be built across the [[Vardar River|Vardar]] in the centre of the city. One is the Art Bridge, which is being constructed between the Freedom Bridge and the also under-construction Eye Bridge. It is expected to cost 2.5 million euros. The bridge will include 29 sculptures, with 14 at each end and one in the centre. It will be 83 metres (272.3 feet) in length and 9.2&amp;nbsp;m (30.2&amp;nbsp;ft) in width, while the central part of the bridge will be 12&amp;nbsp;m (39.4&amp;nbsp;ft) wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://utrinski.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=C71B15A20E1CA24AABF563D72712711D|title=Мостот на уметноста се искачи на конструкцијата|date=April 8, 2012|publisher=Utrinski Vesnik|language=Macedonian|accessdate=19 June 2012|location=Skopje|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613224413/http://www.utrinski.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=C71B15A20E1CA24AABF563D72712711D|archivedate=13 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Eye Bridge=====
The other bridge being constructed as part of the project is the Eye Bridge. Situated between the [[Stone Bridge (Skopje)|Stone Bridge]] and the under-construction Art Bridge, it began construction in 2011. The pedestrian bridge will include 28 sculptures and will cost around 1.5 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://daily.mk/skopje-mostot-oko-konechno-pochna-da-se-gradi?forward=802275|title=Мостот Око конечно почна да се гради|date=July 29, 2011|publisher=Daily.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=19 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Existing bridge renovations====

=====Freedom Bridge=====
[[File:Puente Goce Delcev, Skopie, Macedonia, 2014-04-16, DD 52.JPG|thumb|250px|Aerial view of the renovated Goce Delčev Bridge]]

The project also includes plans to renovate existing bridges in central Skopje, one of which is the Freedom Bridge, which connects Vojvoda Vasil Adžilarski Street in [[Centar Municipality (Skopje)|Centar Municipality]] to Stiv Naumov Street in [[Čair Municipality]]. First constructed in 1936, the renovation began in 2011 and is expected to be completed in May, 2014. The total cost will be roughly 1.15 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirilica.com.mk/vest.asp?id=69962|title=1.140.000 евра за оградата на мостот кај Холидеј Ин|date=May 9, 2012|publisher=Кирилица|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Goce Delčev Bridge=====
The renovation of the Goce Delčev Bridge, which connects Ilinden Boulevard in Centar to Goce Delčev Boulevard in Čair across the Vardar, began on April 11, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=7238|title="Барокна" ограда за мостот Гоце Делчев|date=4 November 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finished later in the year. The renovation included new gold-coloured fencing and 26 lampposts. The project cost roughly 500,000 euros, including 60,000 euros for the new lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=10183|title=Мостот Гоце Делчев во ново светло|date=23 October 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four statues depicting lions, two at each end, were also placed on the bridge in 2010. The ones on the western side were cast in [[Florence]] and cost 1.5 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=4837|title=Поставени два лава на мостот Гоце Делчев|date=24 August 2010|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Revolution Bridge=====
The Revolution Bridge, first built in 1963 across the Vardar connecting Kočo Racin Boulevard in Centar to Krste Misirkov Boulevard in Čair, was also renovated as part of the Skopje 2014 project. It began on December 9, 2010 and was completed in May, 2011. The renovation included basic repairs as well as the installation of 22 lampposts and iron-wrought fencing. The renovation cost 450,000 euros.&lt;ref name="сител"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitel.com.mk/dnevnik/makedonija/pushten-vo-upotreba-rekonstruiraniot-%E2%80%9Emost-na-revolucijata%E2%80%9C|title=Пуштен во употреба реконструираниот "Мост на Револуцијата"|last=Бошковска|first=Елена|date=May 16, 2011|publisher=Сител|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural buildings===

====Macedonian Philharmonic Orchestra hall====
Notable in Skopje 2014 for its bold modern architecture as opposed to the usual neoclassical style seen in the project, the under-construction concert hall to house the Macedonian Philharmonic Orchestra is one of the first buildings to begin construction in the project, with the cornerstone having been laid in June 2009. The exterior of the building is nearing completion.

{{main|Museum of the Macedonian Struggle (Skopje)}}

The Museum of the Macedonian Struggle for Statehood and Independence − Museum of VMRO and Museum of the Victims of the Communist Regime exhibits the strive for an independent Macedonian nation from the [[Ottoman Empire]] and later [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. It is divided into 16 departments and includes over 100 wax figures of historical individuals. The museum lies on the eastern bank of the Vardar River just northwest of the Museum of Archaeology, opposite Macedonia Square. Construction began in June 2008 and it formally opened on September 10, 2011. The total cost of the museum, which covers 2,500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (26,909.8&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), was roughly 10 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=9561|title=ФОТО ВЕСТ: Свечено отворен Музејскиот комплекс "Македонска борба"|date=September 9, 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=19 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====National Theatre====
The former National Theatre destroyed in the [[1963 Skopje earthquake]] will be completely reconstructed, as part of the Skopje 2014 project. Construction of the building, however, began in December 2007, three years before the official announcing of Skopje 2014. Construction was originally planned to be completed in 2009, though it ended up being completed a few years after.&lt;ref name="Factor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://faktor.mk/archives/102033|title=Стариот театар уште "голта" пари|date=10 April 2014|publisher=Factor|language=Macedonian|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre stands on its original location on the eastern bank of the Vardar.

===Government buildings===
The following are new buildings being constructed to house various governmental functions.

====Agency for Electronic Communications====
[[File:Skopje 2014 - Agency for Electronic Communications and Archeological Museum.JPG|thumb|Agency for Electronic Communications (right)]]
The cornerstone for the new building to house the Agency for Electronic Communications was laid on 30 March 2011. It is being constructed on the eastern bank of the Vardar in between two other Skopje 2014 buildings, the Museum of Archaeology and the Financial Police Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=7083|title=Камен темелник за новиот објект на АЕК|date=30 March 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total cost of the building's construction is around 8.5 million euros, which the government claims will be fully funded by the Agency's budget. It is expected to be completed in 15 months or by the late summer of 2012.&lt;ref name="Jovanova"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kapital.mk/MK/dneven_vesnik.aspx/26429/agencijata_za_elektronski_komunikacii_ja_dobiva_svojata_zgrada.aspx?iId=33|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221020103/http://www.kapital.mk/MK/dneven_vesnik.aspx/26429/agencijata_za_elektronski_komunikacii_ja_dobiva_svojata_zgrada.aspx?iId=33|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 February 2013|title=АГЕНЦИЈАТА ЗА ЕЛЕКТРОНСКИ КОМУНИКАЦИИ ЈА ДОБИВА СВОЈАТА ЗГРАДА|last=Jovanova|first=Sonja|date=30 March 2011|publisher=Kapital|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criminal Court Building====
A new Criminal Court Building is being constructed as part of the project. The cornerstone for the building was laid on 25 May 2010. The building, 10 stories tall, has been topped out. In it will be 74 judicial offices, 22 high courts, and 2 large courtrooms. The 2-story basement will contain parking. The building, reported to cost 8.3 million euros, was planned to be completed after 18 months of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=3626|title=Поставен камен темелник за новиот Кривичен суд|date=29 May 2010|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=3 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Financial Police Building====
[[File:MFAandFinancialPoliceBldgSkopje.jpg|220px|thumb|The completed Financial Police and Ministry of Foreign Affairs buildings]]
On 11 October 2010 the cornerstone for the new building to house the Financial Police of the Republic of Macedonia was laid. The site is located between the new Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the new Agency for Electronic Communications. The building, currently several months from completion, is cylindrical in shape and is capped by a dome-shaped roof. The total cost of construction will be roughly 13 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=5216|title=Камен темелник за зграда на Обвинителството и Финансиската полиција|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=4 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ministry of Finance====
The government, in March 2011, invested 8.9 million euros into transforming an abandoned uncompleted building in central Skopje into a new home for the Ministry of Finance. Like the other governmental buildings in Skopje 2014, it will have a neoclassical appearance. Though it was scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2012, the building remains far from completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=6871|title=Министерството за финансии ќе се сели во "Југобанка"|date=8 March 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=4 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ministry of Foreign Affairs====
Construction of the new Ministry of Foreign Affairs building began in January 2010. It is located on the eastern bank of the Vardar between the Financial Police Building and Stiv Naumov Street. It will have two basement levels, seven above-ground levels, and a terrace atop the building. The building, which is nearly complete on the exterior, stands at a height of 27&amp;nbsp;m (88.6&amp;nbsp;ft) and will have costed 13.5 million euros when completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=2837|title=Официјален камен темелник за новото МНР|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=4 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New City Hall====
A new city hall for Skopje is being constructed below the [[Skopje Fortress|Kale Fortress]], on the eastern bank of the Vardar. It is being constructed, as most other buildings in the project, in the neoclassical style and will cost roughly 15 million euros. It will be 21&amp;nbsp;m (68.9&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, with six above-ground floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=7984|title=Се гради објект за скопската градска администрација|date=3 June 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=5 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Old City Hall====
Although a new city hall for Skopje is being constructed, the former one destroyed in the [[1963 Skopje earthquake]] will be fully reconstructed, as part of the Skopje 2014 project. It will be built on its original location at the north side of Macedonia Square, to the west of the Vardar Quay. A Greek investor will be building the Old City Hall, as well as a Marriott Hotel to the immediate left of the building, after purchasing the land in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=6920|title=Грчки инвеститор ќе ги гради Офицерскиот дом и хотелот на Плоштад Македонија|date=12 March 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=5 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water Management Building====
Among the buildings being constructed below the [[Skopje Fortress|Kale Fortress]] on the eastern bank of the Vardar is the Water Management Building. Construction of the building began in December 2011. It is expected to be completed in 3 years at a cost of 10 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.mk/read/58d92cc11d/d4bf718890/index.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221032952/http://www.time.mk/read/58d92cc11d/d4bf718890/index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 February 2013|title=Поставен камен-темелник на новата зграда на ЈП "Водовод и канализација"|date=4 December 2011|publisher=[[Macedonian Radio-Television]]|language=Macedonian|accessdate=5 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trajkovska"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utrinski.com.mk/?ItemID=6C30BE3B498BB14E96CAE30F422EF3AF|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130219022739/http://www.utrinski.com.mk/?ItemID=6C30BE3B498BB14E96CAE30F422EF3AF|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 February 2013|title=Градската администрација ќе добие зграда под Кале|last=Trajkovska|first=Despina|date=13 December 2010|publisher=Utrinski Vesnik|language=Macedonian|accessdate=5 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monuments===

====Justinian I====
[[File:Justinian I . 2 . Monuments in Skopje.JPG|thumb|180px|Justinian I monument]]

The monument of [[Justinian I]], born in [[Tauresium]] just outside modern Skopje, arrived at Macedonia Square on June 16, 2011. Similar to the monument of Tsar Samuil, also on Macedonia Square, it consists of Justinian I sitting on a throne, which is placed on a pedestal. The monument is made of white marble with the exception of the bronze reliefs on the pedestal, also characteristics it shares with the Tsar Samuil monument. The pedestal is 3.5&amp;nbsp;m (11.5&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, while Justinian upon his throne measures a further 5&amp;nbsp;m (16.4&amp;nbsp;ft) in height.

The monument sits just north of the Stone Bridge, at the western bank of the Vardar River. It was made in Florence and cost over 1 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sky.mk/component/content/article/1249-2011-06-17-11-56-48.html|title=Се поставува Јустинијан Први|date=17 June 2011 &lt;!--13:55--&gt;|publisher=Sky.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2011-06-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203085300/http://sky.mk/component/content/article/1249-2011-06-17-11-56-48.html|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mother Teresa====
The construction of a monument consisting of a statue of Skopje native [[Mother Teresa]] and a fountain is planned. The monument will be located near the MEPSO building, which is north of Macedonia Square near the Vardar Quay, though location on the roundabout near the Goce Delčev Bridge is also a possibility. It is planned to stand around 30&amp;nbsp;m (98.4&amp;nbsp;ft) in height, even taller than the Warrior on a Horse monument.

It has been reported that a donation from India will fund the construction of the new Mother Teresa monument, who is already memorialized in the city with the [[Memorial House of Mother Teresa]] and a plaque marking the spot of her birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bukvar.mk/news/kje-se-gradi-spomenik-na-majka-tereza-povisok-od-voinot-na-konj?newsid=9SxW|title=ЌЕ СЕ ГРАДИ СПОМЕНИК НА МАЈКА ТЕРЕЗА ПОВИСОК ОД ВОИНОТ НА КОЊ|date=29 June 2012|publisher=Fakulteti.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=30 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pavilion at Macedonia Square====
[[File:Летниковецот на Плоштад (8).JPG|thumb|left|200px|The Pavilion at Macedonia Square]]

The Pavilion at Macedonia Square is situated on the north side of Macedonia Square. Construction began in early 2011 and was completed later that year at a cost of 350,000 euros.&lt;ref name="Dimitrievski"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://daily.mk/i-letnikovec?forward=567090|title=И летниковец ...|last=Dimitrievski|first=Aleksandar|date=26 January 2011|publisher=Alfa TV|language=Macedonian|accessdate=23 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pavilion consists of a dome supported by several columns, covering a statue of a romantic couple.

{{Main|Porta Macedonia}}

One of the main symbols of the project is Porta Macedonia, a [[triumphal arch]] situated on 11 October Street, near Macedonia Square. The arch is meant to commemorate the long struggle for Macedonian independence. It is 21&amp;nbsp;m (68.9&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and contains 32 reliefs carved on the outside, depicting events from pre-history to the independence of the Republic of Macedonia. The inside of the arch consists of two levels, in which a souvenir shop and a gallery are located, and a rooftop observation deck. It formally opened to the public on Christmas Eve, January 6, 2012. The construction of Porta Macedonia is estimated at 4.5 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=11623|title="Порта Македонија" свечено претставена на јавноста|date=January 6, 2012|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=22 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tsar Samuil====
[[File:Samuil 1. Monuments in Skopje.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Tsar Samuil monument]]

The monument to [[Samuel of Bulgaria]] is among the new focal points of Macedonia Square. Officially unveiled on 28 June 2011, it is situated in front of the Pelister building, to the right of where Macedonia Street meets Macedonia Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a1.com.mk/vesti/default.aspx?VestID=139834|title=Поставен споменикот на Цар Самоил|date=2011-06-28 &lt;!--  15:23 --&gt; |publisher=А1|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monument, mostly in white marble, consists of a depiction of Tsar Samuil sitting on a throne, totaling 5&amp;nbsp;m (16.4&amp;nbsp;ft) in height, and is placed on a pedestal which itself is a further 3.5&amp;nbsp;m (11.5&amp;nbsp;ft) tall. The reliefs on the sides of the pedestal are bronze.  Tsar Samuil, in the monument, holds a scepter. Made in Florence, the total cost of the Tsar Samuil monument was roughly 3.5 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnevnik.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=E96A2FA4FAECB34697607E35AE088F1A|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130219045443/http://www.dnevnik.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=E96A2FA4FAECB34697607E35AE088F1A|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-02-19|title=Споменикот на Цар Самоил стигна на плоштадот "Македонија"|date=2011-06-28 &lt;!-- , 11:11 --&gt;|publisher=Dnevnik|language=Macedonian|accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the opposite side of the Stone Bridge from Macedonia Square is Karpoš's Rebellion Square, which serves as a main entrance to the [[Old Bazaar, Skopje|Old Bazaar]]. It is undergoing a major reconstruction, as part of Skopje 2014, and its new centerpiece will be the statue and fountain officially named "Warrior," though it is widely believed that the statue is a depiction of [[Philip II of Macedon]], not to be confused with the equestrian statue of Philip II in Skopje's Avtokomanda neighborhood. The statue was placed onto the square on 22 May 2012.

Made in Vicenza, the statue is 15&amp;nbsp;m (49.2&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and is placed on a 13&amp;nbsp;m (42.7&amp;nbsp;ft) tall pedestal. The entire monument will cost roughly 2 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=15338|title=Филип Втори поставен на плоштадот "Карпошово востание"|date=22 May 2012|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=29 June 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the main symbol of the Skopje 2014 project is the Warrior on a Horse ({{lang-mk|Воин на коњ}}) statue and fountain in the centre of Macedonia Square. It is typically thought to depict [[Alexander the Great]], though it is not officially named for him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/04/world/europe/macedonia-skopje-2014/index.html Is Macedonia's capital being turned into a theme park?] CNN International, 10 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/14/alexander-great-macedonia-warrior-horse Macedonia statue: Alexander the Great or a warrior on a horse?] The Guardian, Sunday 14 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

The statue was sculpted by [[Valentina Stevanovska]] and cast in Florence. "Alexander" was officially completed on September 8, 2011 to commemorate 20 years of the independence of the Republic of Macedonia. It is 14.5&amp;nbsp;m (47.6&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and it sits on a cylindrical column, which itself is 10&amp;nbsp;m (32.8&amp;nbsp;ft) in height. The column consists of three large ivory sections, each separated by a thinner bronze ring. Each section contains reliefs. The column stands in a fountain. At the base of the column are 8 bronze soldiers, each 3&amp;nbsp;m (9.8&amp;nbsp;ft) tall. There are also 8 bronze lions, each 2.5&amp;nbsp;m (8.3&amp;nbsp;ft) tall, around the edges of the fountain pool, four of which act as part of the fountain, releasing water from their mouths. The fountain also plays music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vesti.alfa.mk/default.aspx?mid=36&amp;eventid=40603|title=Пуштање во употреба фонтана со споменикот "Воин на коњ"|date=8 September 2011|publisher=Alfa TV|language=Macedonian|accessdate=23 June 2012|location=Skopje|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723123128/http://vesti.alfa.mk/default.aspx?mid=36&amp;eventid=40603|archivedate=23 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscellaneous===

====Docked boats in Vardar River====
[[File:Ship in Vardar, Skopje.jpg|thumb|200px|One of building-boats in the Vardar River]]
The first of four building-boats as restaurants and cafes just in the Vardar River opened in July 2014. The boats are erected into the riverbed and, thus, will remain in their planned spots permanently. The boats, all to be situated in central Skopje, were intended to be in the Baroque style.&lt;ref name="plusinfo1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.plusinfo.mk/vest/144687/Zaplovi-prvata-galija-vo-Vardar|title="Заплови" првата галија во Вардар|date=21 July 2014|language=Macedonian|accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sitel.com.mk/dnevnik/makedonija/izbrani-idejnite-reshenija-za-splavovi-na-vardar|title=Избрани идејните решенија за сплавови на Вардар|date=3 March 2012|publisher=Sitel|language=Macedonian|accessdate=20 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ferris wheel====
The erection of a Ferris wheel is foreseen on the Vardar River. It will require the construction of a new pedestrian bridge, to run from the [[Museum of the Macedonian Struggle (Skopje)|Museum of the Macedonian Struggle]] to the MEPSO Building, upon which it will stand. No final plan for the project has been approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.plusinfo.mk/vest/27264/Panoramskoto-trkalo-kje-se-gradi-na-nov-most|title=Панорамското тркало ќе се гради на нов мост|date=21 December 2011|publisher=Plusinfo|language=Macedonian|accessdate=8 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fountains in Vardar River====
The addition of fountains on the Vardar River was planned early on in the project. They were completed in 2010. The fountains have been criticized for reportedly releasing mud, as well as for acting as a filter for trash flowing down the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kirilica.com.mk/vest.asp?id=66369|title=Потскокна и фонтаната во Вардар|date=7 September 2011|publisher=Kirilica|language=Macedonian|accessdate=17 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kale Fortress reconstruction====
Director of Cultural Heritage and archaeologist [[Pasko Kuzman]] has announced a plan to restore and reconstruct the [[Skopje Fortress|Kale Fortress]]. The plan also includes the construction of a museum to house Byzantine archaeological finds from the fortress, as well as reconstructions of a prehistoric house and an Ottoman guard tower to be built on the place of their ruins. Souvenir shops and cafes are also foreseen additions. The most controversial part of the restoration of the fortress is the construction of a church, which has been protested by ethnic Albanians.&lt;ref name="Trpčevska"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utrinski.com.mk/?ItemID=5CE5FDEADB1BF94B8543DC889925F25D|title=Отомански кули и праисториски куќи ќе никнат на Кале|last=Trpčevska|first=Daniela|date=24 August 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=8 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Karpoš's Rebellion Square reconstruction====
Karpoš's Rebellion Square is situated opposite the Vardar River of Macedonia Square and is undergoing a significant reconstruction. Plans include the erection of a statue and fountain depicting Phillip II of Macedon, though officially named "Warrior," at the far northeast side of the square. Another monument consisting of a fountain and statues representing the Mothers of Macedonia is being constructed in front of the Warrior monument. In front of this will be two monuments, also consisting of a fountain and statues, depicting horses. The two will be situated on either side of the entrance to the square from the Stone Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.build.mk/?p=8540|title=Почнува уредувањето на плоштадот Карпошово востание|date=6 July 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=27 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Office building on Macedonia Square====
[[File:OfficeBldgMacedoniaSquare.jpg|thumb|220px|The office building]]

A new office building was constructed on the south side of Macedonia Square, on the Vardar Quay. It stands on the same place as the former headquarters of the National Bank, which was destroyed in the [[1963 Skopje earthquake]]. The new office building is similar in shape to the former bank building, though it is not in the neoclassical style, which also makes it somewhat unusual in the Skopje 2014 project.&lt;ref name="Naumovska"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utrinski.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=4048432E7DF51C4B886B49D49DB3C216|title=Новата зграда во Скопје само ќе личи на Народната банка|last=Naumovska|first=Sanja|date=8 August 2008|publisher=Utrinski Vesnik|language=Macedonian|accessdate=12 July 2012|location=Skopje}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Skanderbeg Square construction====

[[File:Skopje, Daut Pasuv hamam (turecke lazne) ve Skopji, bila budova v.jpg|thumb|220px|Macedonian Opera]]
An existing statue of [[Skanderbeg]], an important historical figure to ethnic Albanians, will be the main fixture of an under construction square that will bear his name in Skopje's [[Čair Municipality]]. The square's total cost is estimated at around 10 million euros and is expected to be completed in 2014. The square will cover 28,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (301,389&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and will extend from Macedonian Philharmonic and Macedonian Opera to the [[Old Bazaar, Skopje|Old Bazaar]]. This will require building a portion of the square on top of Goce Delčev Boulevard. Aside from plenty of open space, the square will contain an amphitheatre, a fountain, and underground parking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kanal5.com.mk/default.aspx?mId=37&amp;eventId=83549&amp;egId=13|title="Скендер Бег" готов до 2014 - та|date=28 November 2011|publisher=build.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=27 July 2012|location=Skopje|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726135632/http://kanal5.com.mk/default.aspx?mId=37|archivedate=26 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.mk/read/218a743d6a/484bce79b5/index.html|title=Плоштадот Скендерг-бег ќе чини 10 милиони евра|date=21 October 2011|publisher=Time.mk|language=Macedonian|accessdate=27 July 2012|location=Skopje|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130219034051/http://www.time.mk/read/218a743d6a/484bce79b5/index.html|archivedate=19 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Special Illumination: The Sufi Use Of Humour''''' is a book by the writer [[Idries Shah]] published [[Octagon Press]] in 1977. Later editions were published in 1983, 1989 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Amazon.com page on Special Illumination: The Sufi Use Of Humour&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfil the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, ''Special Illumination'' can be read as part of a whole course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Content==

[[File:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|left|100px|Idries Shah]]
''Special Illumination'' was the phrase used by Jalaludin [[Rumi]] to stress the importance of humour in relation to mystical experience; 'If you want special illumination look upon the human face: See clearly within laughter the Essence of Ultimate Truth.'

Presenting commentaries, stories and jokes, Shah writes; ‘Rumi directly contradicts such numerous sour-faced religionists as, in all persuasions, find that humour disturbs the indoctrination which is all that they usually have to offer.’

==Reception==

In the essay ''The Sufis and Idries Shah'', the [[Nobel Prize]]–winning novelist [[Doris Lessing]] writes that the book is about the Sufi use of humour, not an academic treatise, and takes the reader "through a sequence of tales, explaining possible meanings." She tells us that "Shah warns not to fall in love with the great classics of the past. 'People study Rumi and turn themselves into perfect replicas of 14th century people.' For classics to be of use, we need a Sufi to choose the parts that are still relevant, and put them into our context — to 'unlock' them."&lt;ref name="TimeBites"&gt;{{cite book

The '''Taran Panth''', also known as '''Taran Svami Panth''', '''Taran Samaj''' or '''Taranapanthi''', is a sect of [[Digambara]] [[Jainism]] founded by [[Taran Svami]] in [[Bundelkhand]] in central India in c. 1505 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Smarika, Sarva Dharma Sammelan, 1974, Taran Taran Samaj, Jabalpur&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taran Svami==
{{main|Taran Svami}}
Taran Svami was a Jain religious teacher and founder of the Taran Panth. He lived in the 15th century central India. The traditional biographies places him within the Digambara mystic tradition. They also consider him as a ritual reformer for rejecting the authority of [[Bhattaraka]]s and his emphasis on [[aniconism]] and inner realization. He is credited with writing fourteen texts.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=264-277}}

==Texts==
{{Jainism}}
The following fourteen texts are credited to Taran Svami. These texts are classified in five systems mentioned in one manuscript of ''Thikanesara'' (now at Khurai temple).{{snf|Cort|2006|p=277-278}} Scholars have expressed doubts about his authorship of the ''Chadmastha Vani'' as it cites his death and of the ''Nama Mala'' as it contains names of his disciples. These texts are classified in five systems mentioned in one manuscript of ''Thikanesara'' (now at Khurai temple).{{snf|Cort|2006|p=277}}

* ''Vicara mata'' (Reflections)
** ''Malarohana'' ("Garland offering")
** ''Pandita Puja'' ("Wise worship")
** ''Kamala Battisi'' ("Lotus thirty-two [verses]")
* ''Acara mata'' (Conduct)
** ''Shravakacara'' ("Lay conduct")
* ''Sara mata'' (Essential teachings)
** ''Jñana Samuccaya Sara'' ("Collected essence of knowledge")
** ''Tribhangi Sara'' ("Essence in triads")
** ''Upadesha Shuddha Sara'' ("Pure essence of the teachings")
* ''Mamala mata'' (Spiritual purity)
** ''Mamala Pahuda'' ("Handbook on purity")
** ''Caubisa Thana'' ("Twenty-four topics")
* ''Kevala mata'' (Enlightenment)
** ''Chadmastha Vani'' ("Sayings of the unliberated")
** ''Nama Mala'' ("Garland of names")
** ''Khatika Vishesa'' ("Special uprooter")
** ''Siddha Subhava'' ("Nature of the perfected soul")
** ''Sunna Subhava'' ("Nature of emptiness")

The three texts in the ''Vicara mata'' category are thirty-two verse compositions. They are the most popular texts of Taran Svami. ''Malarohana'' was composed for the marriage of Taran Svami's followers, according to the tradition. It is still read during marriage of the followers. Premi had said that during [[Daslakshana]],  the followers gather in the temple and recite ''Pandita Puja'' and ''Mamalapahuda'' in day and ''Malarohana'' and ''Kamala Battisi'' at night. K. Samaiya had equated them with [[Ratnatraya]]. Some members recite some of these texts daily.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=278}}

Other texts are not well-known. ''Sravakacara'' has 462 verses which defines code of conduct for lay followers which draws from earlier Digambara text ''[[Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra]]''. The ''Jñana Samuccaya Sara'' has 908 verses, and the ''Upadesha Shuddha Sara'' has 588 verses. These two texts discuss the Digambara philosophy and metaphysics. The ''Jñana Samuccaya Sara'' discusses ''[[Ratnatraya]]'', scriptures, the stages of lay spirituality, [[Ethics of Jainism|''Anuvrata'' and ''Mahavrata'']], seven types of Jain philosophy, ''[[Dravya]]'', ''Dhyana '' etc. The ''Upadesha Shuddha Sara'' discusses the path of liberation and its hurdles. The ''Tribhangi Sara'' has 71 verses which discusses the topics in triads. These four texts are close to the Digambara tradition of philosophy.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=278-279}}

The ''Mamala Pahuda'' is a collection of songs. It has more than 3,200 verses. The ''Caubisa Thana'' discusses 24 topics of spirituality to gain liberation. It is mix of prose and verse and about 20 pages in total.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=279}}

The ''Chadmastha Vani'' and ''Nama Mala'' are short prose texts about nine pages. It has information on Taran Svami and his followers and other subjects. Premi had said that ''Chadmastha Vani'' is recited by followers for five days after [[Diwali]]. The ''Khatika Vishesa'' discusses about ''Karma'' in context of the cycle of time. It is mix of prose and verse. The ''Siddha Subhava'' and ''Sunna Subhava'' are short prose. The ''Siddha Subhava'' discusses the purification of soul while the ''Sunna Subhav'' discusses ways of destoying ego.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=279}}

Commentaries on six of the main texts composed by Taran Svami were written by Brahmacari Shitala Prasad in the 1930s. Commentaries on other texts have also been done recently. [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh|Osho]] (Rajnish), who was born into a Taranpanthi family, has included ''Sunna Subhava'' and ''Siddhi Subhava'' as among the books that influenced him most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://osho.nl/New-Osho-NL/EnglBooks/BooksIHave.htm |title=Books I have Loved |publisher=Osho.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517013255/http://www.osho.nl/New-Osho-NL/EnglBooks/BooksIHave.htm |archivedate=17 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After death of Taran Svami, the history of the sect is unclear. The ''Nam Mala'' contains around 2000 names but its significance is unclear. Based on oral traditions, Taran Svami had disciples from varied classes and castes. His disciples were from Jain as well from non-Jain background. Some of his disciples had Muslim background. No scholarly study has constructed the early history of Taran Panth due to clear lack of literary tradition. The religious profession is also unclear in the sect. There were some associated with ''Nisaiji'' temples. There are no monks in the sect but they had some lay celibates (''Brahmachari'' and ''Brahmacharini''s).{{snf|Cort|2006|p=280-282}}

Today a large number of the followers of Taran Panth come from six merchant castes of [[Bundelkhand]] region of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Three of these – Samaiya, Dosakhe and Gulalare – were converts from [[Murtipujaka]] Jain communities, and the other three – Asethi, Ayodhyavasi and Carnagar – were converts from [[Vaishnava]] Hindu communities as informed to Jain scholar Cort. The total number of the followers of the Taran Panth range from 20,000 to 100,000. R. Samaiya had listed 131 temples and the number of followers just under 20,000 in 1989. Majority of the followers reside in Madhya Pradesh and some in south [[Uttar Pradesh]] and northwest [[Maharashtra]].{{snf|Cort|2006|p=281-282}}

==Pilgrimage sites and temples==
[[File:NisaiJiBina.jpg|thumb|Nisaiji, built by Tarachand Mallusav, 1817.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=285}}]]

The most important site is located in Malhargadh village in [[Guna district]] where Taran Svami spent his final years and where his last rites were performed. The shrine known as Nisaiji ("Honoured Memorial") is on the banks of the Betwa river.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=282}} The three-days annual fair known as Phag Phulna ("Phag Flowering") is orhanised from [[Falgun]] Bright Fifth. In the past, there was an annual fair organised in honour of one of his Muslim disciple Ruiya Raman or Ruiya Jin but it is discontinued. Many followers visit here for [[Chudakarana]] ritual of their children. The shrine has stone windows and high canopies built in "late medieval Rajput" style. The style became standard for other shrines. The history of the site is written by Phulchandra who says that the shrine was initially just a ''chhatri'' (canopy). In 1817,  Taracand Mallusav, a merchant from [[Nagpur]] rebuilt the shrine in its current form, the platform with twelve doors and several canopies. He had sponsored the annual fair and one of his family member, Kesaridau, died here. The shrine is simple and has a central marble altar which houses a pile of printed books. Behind it, there is an older stone altar which is considered as the original one. There are a records of patrons of fair from 1817. Since 1933, the fair is organised by the community. There are no images due to Taran Svami's emphasis on aniconism. There are three stone platforms in the Betwa river associated with events in his life.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=283-285}}

Semarkheri located near Sironj in [[Vidisha district]] has a shrine built by [[Banjara]]s. Here he spent some time engaging in spiritual activities. The annual fair is organised on [[Vasant Panchami]]. It is oldest shrine after Nisaiji and has records of the patrons of the fair dating back to 1881.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=282-283}} Sukha near Pathariya village in [[Damoh district]] where Taran Svami preached. The old site was in dilapidated condition before the new constructions started in 1938. The annual fair is organised on Agahan Bright Seventh (November–December). The day of fair known as ''Taran Jayanti'' and is of recent origin. The shrine at Bilhari village near Katni in [[Jabalpur district]] is associated with birth of Taran Svami. The site became focus of community only recently and no annual fair is organised here.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=283}}

There is a memorial dedicated to Himau Pande, one of Taran Svami's chief disciple at Chand village in [[Chhindwara district]]. The site only recently became a focus of development by local followers. There was only large platform in the past but now a large temple is built. The annual fair is organised on Jeth Dark Sixth, known as Samadhi Sixth, the death anniversary of Himau Pande.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=283}}

There is also a large platform at Garaula (or Garhaula), near Tindua in [[Damoh district]] which is associated with Taran Svami's childhood days at his maternal uncle's house.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=283}}

The temples are fairly simple in design with open spaces and least ornamentation. The marble altars in temple has symbols associated with generalized auspiciousness. Due to aniconic emphasis, there are no images placed in the temples. Sometimes the altar has books of Taran Svami and of other writers from Digambara mystic and philosophical traditions.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=286}}

==Rituals and practices==
The order of the services were organised by Jayasagar in the mid-twentieth century.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=288}}

The temple rituals are as follows: The follower enters the temple and bows to the altar as the sign of respect then recites three verses drawn from Taran Svami's texts known as ''Tatva Patha'' or ''Tatva Mangal'' in front of the altar. This is followed by singing ''[[Bhajan]]''s or hymns. If there is a sermon, ''bhaiji'' or ''pande'',  a local intellectual associated with temple or other intellectuals known as ''[[pandit|pundit]]'' will deliver sermons to seated followers. The sermon ends with everyone standing and singing a hymn known as ''Abalabali''. The ritual ends with the ''[[Arati]]''. The ''Arati'' has two parts; the first one is dedicated to ''Dev'' (God), ''Guru'' (teacher) and scriptures while the other part is dedicated to Taran Svami.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=290-291}}

Initially, Technopolis was scheduled to be held in [[Buenos Aires]] after the [[Argentina Bicentennial]] celebrations.

The mega exhibition was planned to be the end of the Bicentennial celebrations organized by the national government in 2010, and inaugurated on November 19, 2010 in Buenos Aires for the "Day of Sovereignty", the anniversary of the [[Battle of Vuelta de Obligado]], in the area of parks of the [[Avenida Figueroa Alcorta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''templon''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] τέμπλον meaning "temple", plural ''templa'') is a feature of [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] churches consisting of a barrier separating the [[nave]] from the [[sacraments]] at the [[altar]].

The solid templon first appeared in Christian churches around the 5th century and is still found in many [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] churches. Initially it was a low barrier probably not much different from the [[altar rails]] of many Western churches. It eventually evolved into the modern [[iconostasis]], still found in Orthodox churches today.

It is usually composed of carved wood or marble colonnettes supporting an [[architrave]] (a beam resting on top of columns). Three doors, a large central one and two smaller flanking ones, lead into the [[sanctuary]]. The templon did not originally obscure the view of the altar, but as time passed, [[icons]] were hung from the beams, curtains were placed in between the colonnettes, and the templon became more opaque. In modern Orthodox churches, it is common for the openings of the templa to be constructed specifically to contain icons.

==Origins==
[[Image:Proskenionastemplon.jpg|thumb|A Greek [[scaenae frons]] (theater screen) portraying a three-doored temple facade, posited in the early 20th century as a possible origin for the design of the templon.]]The templon most likely has an independent origin from that of [[Latin]] chancel barriers. Classical stage architecture is one possible source. At certain times during Byzantine history, [[theater]] heavily influenced painting and sculpture. Architects then, influenced by stage backdrops dating back to [[Sophocles]], consciously imitated the classical ''proskenion'' (Latin [[proscenium]]; the backdrop of a classical Greek stage), copying the multiple columns punctuated by a large door in the middle and two smaller doors to each side. The statues on top of the backdrop would thus be analogous to the icons of the saints looking down.&lt;ref name="myref-12"&gt;[[Josef Strzygowski|Strzygowski, Josef]]. "A Sarcophagus of the Sidamara Type ... and the Influence of Stage Architecture upon the Art of Antioch." ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'', '''Vol. 27''' (1907). 99–122.&lt;/ref&gt; The similarities, however, are probably only visual. Although classical drama was performed in [[Constantinople]], the capital of the Byzantine Empire, during the 5th and 6th century when the first templa appear, when Christian [[liturgy]] was first being developed, the plays and their architecture had lost their importance and could not have influenced Christian ritual.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

A much more plausible theory is that the templon models, in both form and content, the decorative wall of the [[Torah screen]] in [[Jewish]] [[synagogue]]s of the 2nd and 3rd centuries. These, too, had three main divisions: a central door leading to the altar, smaller flanking passages, and a distribution of parts similar to a templon. The Torah screen was probably not the direct prototype of the templon; it probably derives from the imitation of the Torah screen in the altar of a typical [[Syria]]n [[Paganism|pagan]] [[temple]].&lt;ref name="myref-2"&gt;Swift, Emerson Howland. ''Hagia Sophia''. Columbia University Press, New York, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

A direct comparison can also be made to the layout of the great [[Temple of Jerusalem]]. The most sacred and innermost portion, known as the [[Holy of Holies]], was where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was kept. This room was separated from the larger part of the main building's interior by a large curtain, the "[[parochet|veil of the temple]]". Only the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies, and only once a year on [[Yom Kippur]]. The third part was the entrance court. This architectural tradition for the two main parts can be seen carried forward in Christian churches and is still most demonstratively present in Eastern Orthodox churches where the iconostatsis divides the altar, the Holy of Holies containing the consecrated Eucharist - the manifestation of the New Covenant, from the larger portion of the church accessible to the faithful. In Orthodox Christian tradition, with the exception of churches at women's [[monastery|monasteries]], only men with good cause may enter the altar portion behind the iconostasis.

Barriers called templons in Greek were also used on occasions when the [[Roman Emperor]]s appeared in public, to segregate the Imperial retinue from the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Cheremeteff in Leong, Albert ed.;''The Millennium: Christianity and Russia, A.D. 988–1988''; p.108-110; 1990; St Vladimir's Seminary Press;{{ISBN|0-88141-080-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Templon'' is a [[loan word]] in Greek, from the [[Latin]] ''templum'', "[[temple]]"; how and why it came to have its present meaning is unclear. The most obvious explanation is that the form of the templon resembles a pagan [[temple]]. The steps up to the [[apse]] (semicircle where the altar is located) are analogous to the [[stylobate|stereobate]] and [[stylobate]] of the temple (the floor of a temple). The colonnettes arranged in the π shape resemble the [[columns]] that surround all four sides of a temple, the [[architrave]] looks like the architrave on a temple, and the carved disks on the architrave are analogous to the [[metope (architecture)|metopes]] on the [[entablature]]. 

However, it has also been suggested that the name templon derives not from the pagan temples but from the Christian idea of the shrine where God was worshipped, or more specifically the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].
In almost all modern European languages, the word ''templon'' is a direct and late borrowing of the Greek architectural term, and it is rarely found outside the academic usage; besides the Greek ''templon'', another direct descendant of the Latin ''templum'', having the same architectural meaning, is the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] word ''tâmplă'', "iconostasis".{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://dexonline.ro/search.php?lexemId=56280 tâmplă]{{dead link|date=August 2011}} at the Online Version of the Explanatory Dictionary of the Romanian Language.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early templa==
[[File:Rom, Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Innenansicht.JPG|thumb|[[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]], Rome]]
Archaeological evidence for an early templon comes from the [[Monastery of Stoudios|Cathedral of St. John at Stoudios]] in Constantinople, a [[basilica]] dedicated to [[John the Baptist]], built around 463. The chancel barrier surrounded the altar in a π shape, with one large door facing the nave and two smaller doors on the other sides. Twelve piers held chancel slabs of about 1.6 meters in length. The height of the slabs is not known. The chancel barrier was not merely a low [[parapet]] (a short wall); remains of colonnettes have been found, suggesting that the barrier carried an architrave on top of the columns.&lt;ref name="myref-9"&gt;Matthews, Thomas F. ''The Early Churches of Constantinople: Architecture and Liturgy''. Pennsylvania State University Press, PA, 1971, {{ISBN|0-271-00108-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fragments of a marble templon have been discovered on the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Was the Aksa Mosque built over the remains of a Byzantine church?, By ETGAR LEFKOVITS, Jerusalem Post, November 16, 2008 [https://www.jpost.com/Israel/Was-the-Aksa-Mosque-built-over-the-remains-of-a-Byzantine-church]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there is some architectural and archaeological evidence of early templa, the first and most detailed description of a templon comes from a poem by [[Paul the Silentiary]], describing [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople. It was composed near the end of [[Justinian I]]’s reign and was probably recited on [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]], January 6, 563, celebrating the reinauguration of the church after the reconstruction of the great dome.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Hagia Sophia’s templon surrounded, according to Paulus, "such space as was reserved in the eastern arch of the great church for the bloodless sacrifices".&lt;ref name="myref-8"&gt;Lethaby, W. R. and Swainson, Harold. ''The Church of Sancta Sophia Constantinople: A Study of Byzantine Building''. Macmillan and Co., London, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, it stretched the length of the eastern semidome, including the apse but excluding the [[exedra]]e (half-dome recesses in a wall). Twelve silver-covered marble columns of approximately 4.94 meters from base to capital were arranged on three sides of a rectangular ground plan around the altar. A horizontal entablature rested upon these. Three doors allowed entry to the apse, the central one larger than the other two. Though earlier scholars have proposed that all columns and all doors were in a single line parallel to the apse, modern reconstructions show the central portal facing out to the nave with the smaller doors each located on the other sides of the rectangular plan.&lt;ref name="myref-15"&gt;Xydis, Stephen G. "The Chancel Barrier, Solea, and Ambo of Hagia Sophia." ''The Art Bulletin''. '''Vol. 29''', No. 1 (March 1947). 1–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In between the columns were slabs of marble covered in silver about 1.00 to 1.10 meters tall. On them had been carved the monograms of Justinian and [[Theodora (6th century)]], even though Theodora had been dead for several years, as well as a many-armed [[cross]] in the center. On the center of the architrave was a [[repoussé]] medallion of [[Christ]]. On either side of Him were medallions of angels, the [[Prophet]]s, the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]], and finally the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]. The carvings on the architrave were deeply tied to the liturgy. Another templon roughly contemporary to Hagia Sophia’s is that of the church to [[St. John of Ephesus]], rebuilt by Justinian as a domed crucifix.&lt;ref name="myref-10"&gt;Procopius. ''Procopius. Vol. VII: Buildings''. Trans. H.B. Dewing and Glanville Downey, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; There was an inscription to [[St. John the Theologian]] over a side door, since the crypt of the saint was within the enclosed sanctuary. [[St. John the Baptist]] was probably carved over the other door of the templon of Hagia Sophia, since he features prominently in liturgical writings of the church.

In any case, the majority of templa followed the same basic design. They were usually carved of monochrome marble, though some, like Hagia Sophia’s, were covered in precious metals and others used [[polychrome]] [[marble]]s. The slabs were often carved with vegetal or animal patterns and the architraves with [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] of God, the Virgin, and the saints. Figurative decoration on the templon was mainly concentrated on the [[architrave]], initially with carved busts. This continued from the time of Justinian into the middle Byzantine period, as shown from a 10th-century excavation in [[Elaiussa Sebaste|Sebaste]] in [[Phrygia]], which uncovered a marble templon whose epistyle is covered with busts of saints. There is evidence that icons were hung from the columns of the templon prior to [[iconoclasm]]. [[Saint Nicephorus|Nicephorus I]], [[Patriarch]] of Constantinople from 806 to 815 describes portable icons hung from columns and the gate of the templon in his ''Antirretikoi''. Important portable and colossal icons were also placed in front of the templon, as in the 11th-century church of [[Saint Panteleimon]] in [[Nerzei]].&lt;ref name="myref-6"&gt;Kavan, Katrina. "Screen: Early Christian and Byzantine." ''The Grove Dictionary of Art Online''. Oxford University Press, Accessed 23 March 2004. &lt;www.groveart.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
[[Image:Iconostasis in Moscow.jpg|thumb|Five-panel Deesis row, Iconostasis of the [[Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow|Cathedral of the Annunciation]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]] by [[Theophanes the Greek]], 1405 – the first five-row Iconostasis]]
The templon gradually replaced all other forms of chancel barriers in Byzantine churches in the 6th, 7th, and 8th centuries except in [[Cappadocia]]. As late as the 10th century, a simple wooden chancel barrier separated the apse from the nave in the rock-cut churches, though by the late 11th century, the templon had become standard. This may have been because of the veneration and imitation of the Great Church Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, though the columnar form of chancel barrier does predate Hagia Sophia.&lt;ref name="myref-7"&gt;{{cite book| last=Kostof| first= Spiro| title=Caves of God: The Monastic Environment of Byzantine Cappadocia| publisher= MIT Press| location= Cambridge, MA| year= 1972| isbn= 0-262-11042-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The templon began to change forms to the medieval templon with the attachment of icons and painted scenes to the architrave. Some of the best preserved of these images are from the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]] in [[Egypt]]. The late 12th-century templon beam shows twelve canonical feast scenes, with the [[Deesis]] (Christ enthroned, flanked by Mary and St. John the Baptist) located in the middle between the Transfiguration and the Raising of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], linking the scene of Lazarus with the [[Holy Week]] images according to liturgical practice. Several epistyles of this form have been excavated throughout the empire, none earlier than the 12th century, indicating a change from busts on the architrave to scenic decoration. This new scenic style is representative of the increasing liturgification in Byzantine representational art after iconoclasm.&lt;ref name="myref-3"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Epstein| first= A. W.| title=The Middle-Byzantine Sanctuary Barrier: Templon or Iconostasis?| journal=The Journal of the British Archaeological Association| volume= 134| year=1981| pages= 1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During most of the Middle Byzantine period, the space between the colonnettes was not filled with icons but with curtains. [[Nicholaos Andidorum]] describes in his ''Protheoria'' "the shutting of the doors and the closing of the curtain over them".&lt;ref name="myref-13"&gt;"Templon." ''The [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]''. Ed. Alexander P. Kazhdan, '''Vol. 3'''. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1991. 2023–4, {{ISBN|0-19-504652-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most widespread image on the medieval templon seems to have been the Deesis. Its popularity arose from not only its simplicity and elegance, suggesting the [[efficacy of prayer]] and the threat of the [[Last Judgment]], but also because it could be easily adapted to the patron’s tastes with the addition of secondary scenes and characters, as in the Saint Catherine's Monastery where scenes from the life of [[St Eustratios]] appear on either side of the Deesis on a templon beam. [[Proskynetarion|Proskynetaria]] (large icons) also played a major part in the decoration of the medieval templon, either as monumental images placed on the piers flanking the templon or as portable images in front of the screen. Proskynetaria of both these types still exist in Cyprus, from Lagoudera, now in the Archbishop’s Palace in Nicosia, and in St Neophytos.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Naya, Carlo (1816-1882) - n. 52 - Venezia - Interno di San Marco.jpg|thumb|A columnar templon at [[St Mark's Basilica]], [[Venice]]]]

Sometime between the 11th and 14th centuries, icons and proskynetaria began to be placed in the intercolumnar openings on the templon. After the reconquest in 1261, carving on the medieval templon approached [[sculpture|sculpture in the round]]. From this period, the first wood-carved templa, or [[iconostasis|iconostases]], were produced. They for most part had a fixed program of icon decoration with three levels: the Local, the Deesis, and the Festival tiers. Early Russian versions were at chest height, and called "thoraxis" in Greek.

The full height iconostasis became standard in the 15th century, and probably owes more to 14th-century [[Hesychasm|Hesychast]] mysticism and the wood-carving genius of the [[Russians]] than anything else. The first ceiling-high, five-leveled Russian iconostasis was designed for the [[Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow|Cathedral of the Annunciation]] in [[Moscow Kremlin]] by [[Theophanes the Greek]] in 1405, and soon copied by his assistant [[Andrey Rublyov]] in the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] in [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] in 1408.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Cheremeteff in Leong, Albert ed.;''The Millennium: Christianity and Russia, A.D. 988–1988''; p.109-110; 1990; St Vladimir's Seminary Press;{{ISBN|0-88141-080-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Textile arts of indigenous peoples of the Americas''' are decorative, utilitarian, ceremonial, or conceptual artworks made from [[fiber crop|plant]], [[animal fiber|animal]], or [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] [[fiber]]s by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|native peoples of both North and South America]].

[[Textile arts]] and [[fiber arts]] include [[fabric]] that is flexible woven material, as well as [[felt]], bark cloth, knitting, embroidery,&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Gibbs 1&lt;/ref&gt; featherwork, [[skin-sewing]], [[beadwork]], and similar media. Textile arts are one of the earliest known industries.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; [[Basketry]] is associated with textile arts.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs 6&lt;/ref&gt;

While humans have created textiles since the dawn of culture, many are fragile and disintegrate rapidly. Ancient textiles are preserved only by special environmental conditions. The oldest known textiles in [[the Americas]] is some early fiberwork found in [[Guitarrero Cave]], Peru dating back to 10,1000 to 9,080 BCE.&lt;ref name=carbon&gt;Stacey, Kevin. [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-04/uocp-cdi041311.php "Carbon dating identifies South America's oldest textiles."] ''University of Chicago Press Journals.'' 13 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known textiles in [[North America]] are [[twine]] and [[plain weave]] fabrics preserved in a [[peat]] pond at the [[Windover Archaeological Site]] in [[Florida]], the earliest dating to 6,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spike|first=Tamara|title=Review of Doran, Glen H., ed., Windover: Multidisciplinary Investigations of an Early Archaic Florida Cemetery.|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=7863|publisher=Humanities and Social Sciences Online|accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural regions==

===Andes===
{{Main|Andean textiles}}
[[File:Inca Quipu.jpg|thumb|An [[Inca]] [[quipu]], or textile recording device]]
As previously mentioned, fragments of rope and textiles dating back between 12,100 and 11,080 years ago have been unearthed from [[Guitarrero Cave]] in Peru.&lt;ref name=carbon/&gt; Because of the extremely dry conditions of the desert sands, twined textiles from the [[Norte Chico civilization]] in Peru have survived, dating back to 2500-1800 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Stone-Miller 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton and wool from alpaca, llamas, and vicuñas have been woven into elaborate textiles for thousands of years in the Andes and are still important parts of Quechua and [[Aymara people|Aymara]] culture today. Coroma in [[Antonio Quijarro Province]], [[Bolivia]] is a major center for ceremonial textile production.&lt;ref&gt;Siegal 15&lt;/ref&gt; An Aymara elder from Coroma said, "In our sacred weavings are expressions of our philosophy, and the basis for our social organization... The sacred weavings are also important in differentiating one community, or ethnic group, from a neighboring group..."&lt;ref&gt;Siegal 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Aguayo (cloth)|Aguayo]]s are clothes woven from camelid fibers with geometric designs that Andean women wear and use for carrying babies or goods.

===Circum-Caribbean===
[[File:KunaWomanWithMolas.jpg|thumb|Kuna woman with [[Mola (art form)|molas]], [[San Blas Islands]], [[Panama]].]]
[[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] tribal members of [[Panama]] and [[Colombia]] are famous for their [[Mola (art form)|mola]]s, cotton panels with elaborate geometric designs created by a reverse [[appliqué]] technique. Designs originated from traditional skin painting designs but today exhibit a wide range of influences, including [[popular culture|pop culture]]. Two mola panels form a blouse, but when a Kuna woman is tired of a blouse, she can dissemble it and sell the molas to art collectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panart.com/molainfo.htm About Molas.] ''Indigenous Art from Panamá.'' (retrieved 28 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesoamerica===
{{Further|Maya textiles}}
Mayan women have woven cotton with backstrap looms for centuries, creating items such as ''[[huipil]]s'' or traditional blouses. Elaborate [[Maya textiles]] featured representations of animals, plants, and figures from oral history.&lt;ref&gt;Geise, Paula. [http://www.mythinglinks.org/Geise~MayanWeaving.html Clothing, Regalia, Textiles from the Chiapas Highlands of Mexico.] ''Mything Links.'' 22 December 1999 (retrieved 28 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, weaving serves as both an art form and a source of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Ashley E.|last2=Greenfield|first2=Patricia M.|last3=Childs|first3=Carla P.|date=1999|title=Culture, History, Biology, and Body: Native and Non-Native Acquisition of Technological Skill|jstor=640594|journal=Ethos|volume=27|issue=3|pages=379–402}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizing into weaving collectives have helped Mayan women earn better money for their work and greatly expand the reach of Mayan textiles in the world.

===Southeastern Woodlands===
Pieces of 7,000- to 8,000-year-old [[textile|fabric]] have been found with human burials at the [[Windover Archaeological Site]] in Florida. The burials were in a [[peat]] pond. The fabric had turned into peat, but was still identifiable. Many bodies at the site had been wrapped in fabric before burial. Eighty-seven pieces of fabric were found associated with 37 burials. Researchers have identified seven different weaves in the fabric. One kind of fabric had 26 strands per inch (10 strands per centimeter). There were also weaves using two-strand and three-strand [[weft]]s. A round bag made from [[twine]] was found, as well as [[matting]]. The [[yarn]] was probably made from palm leaves. [[Sabal palmetto|Cabbage palm]], [[saw palmetto]] and [[Sabal etonia|scrub palmetto]] are all common in the area, and would have been so 8,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Robin C.|title=Florida's First People: 12,000 Years of Human History|year=1994|publisher=Pineapple Press|location=Sarasota, Florida|isbn=1-56164-032-8|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milanich|first=Jerald T.|title=Archaeology of Precolumbian Florida|year=1994|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-1273-2|pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seminole patchwork shawl.jpg|thumb|[[Seminole patchwork]] shawl made by Susie Cypress from [[Big Cypress Indian Reservation]], c. 1980s]]
[[Seminole]] seamstresses, upon gaining access to sewing machines in the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, invented an elaborate appliqué patchwork tradition. Seminole patchwork, for which the tribe is known today, came into full flower in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Blackard, David M. and Patsy West. [http://www.seminoletribe.com/culture/clothing.shtml Seminole Clothing: Colorful Patchwork.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316140336/http://www.seminoletribe.com/culture/clothing.shtml |date=2008-03-16 }} ''Seminole Tribe of Florida.'' (retrieved 11 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northeastern Woodlands===
Great Lakes and Prairie tribes are known for their [[ribbonwork]], found on clothing and blankets. Strips of silk ribbons are cut and appliquéd in layers, creating designs defined by negative space. The colors and designs might reflect the clan or gender of the wearer. [[Powwow]] and other dance regalia from these tribes often feature ribbonwork. These tribes are also known for their [[Fingerweaving|fingerwoven]] sashes.

Experimental contemporary textile artists include Martha Gradolf ([[Ho-Chunk]]), whose work addresses historic injustices against native peoples,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Rachel. [http://www.ourbrowncounty.com/1202s3.htm Martha (Marty) Gradolf: Idea Weaver.] ''Our Brown County.'' (retrieved 28 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marie Watt]] ([[Seneca Nation|Seneca]]), who creates installations and interactive artworks using blankets as a metaphor.

===Oasisamerica===
[[Pueblo]] men weave with cotton on upright looms. Their mantas and sashes are typically made for ceremonial use for the community, not for outside collectors.

[[Navajo rug]]s are woven by Navajo women today from [[Navajo-Churro sheep]] or commercial wool. Designs can be pictorial or abstract, based on traditional Navajo, Spanish, Oriental, or Persian designs. 20th century Navajo weavers include [[Clara Sherman]] and [[Hosteen Klah]], who co-founded the [[Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian]].

Valencia, Joseph and Ramona Sakiestewa ([[Hopi]])&lt;ref&gt;Indyke, Dottie. [http://www.southwestart.com/in_swa/native_arts/1478 Ramona Sakiestewa.] ''Southwest Art.'' (retrieved 28 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and Melissa Cody ([[Navajo people|Navajo]]) explore non-representational abstraction and use experimental materials in their weaving.

===Northwest coast===
{{Further|Salish weaving}}
[[File:Chilkat blanket univ alaska museum.jpg|thumb|Chilkat blanket in the collection of the [[University of Alaska Museum of the North]], [[Fairbanks, Alaska]]]]
Traditional textiles of Northwest Coast tribes are enjoying a dramatic revival. [[Chilkat weaving]] and [[ravenstail]] weaving are regarded as some of the most difficult weaving techniques in the world. A single Chilkat blanket can take an entire year to weave. In both techniques, dog, mountain goat, or sheep wool and shredded cedar bark are combined to create textiles featuring curvilinear [[formline design]]s. [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] weaver [[Jennie Thlunaut]] (1892–1986) was instrumental in this revival.

[[Button blanket]]s are wool blankets embellished with mother-of-pearl buttons worn on significant occasions, such as [[potlatch]]es.

'''''Die Stadt ohne Juden''''' (''The City Without Jews'') is a 1924 Austrian [[Expressionist]] film by [[H. K. Breslauer]], based on the book of the same title by [[Hugo Bettauer]]. The film is one of the few surviving Expressionist films from Austria and has therefore been well researched.&lt;ref name="medienimpulse"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas |last=Ballhausen |first2=Günter |last2=Krenn |title=(Alb)Traumhaft: Die Stadt ohne Juden |journal=Medienimpulse |volume=57 |date=September 2006 |pages=35–39 |url=http://www.mediamanual.at/mediamanual/themen/pdf/sicherheit/57_Ballhausen-Krenn-Die_unheimliche_Leinwand.pdf |accessdate=19 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was first shown on 25 July 1924 in [[Vienna]].

In his novel, published in 1922, Hugo Bettauer succeeded in creating a relatively accurate allegorical vision of the near future, although the book was intended as entertainment and as a satirical response to the primitive [[antisemitism]] of the 1920s. It immediately became Bettauer's most popular work: it was translated into several languages, and sold over a quarter of a million copies. Shortly after the premiere of the film Hugo Bettauer was murdered by [[Otto Rothstock]], a former member of the [[Nazi Party]], who was lionized by the antisemitic Austrian masses and was released less than two years after having been committed to a psychiatric institution.&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alexander P. Moulton|title=A Wary Silence: Karl Kraus in Interwar Vienna|journal=The Columbia Historical Review|volume=2|date=Winter 2002|pages=15–43|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/history/pdf/chr_vol2.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317005326/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/history/pdf/chr_vol2.pdf|archive-date=2007-03-17|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
In Austria the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] comes to power, and the new Chancellor Dr.&amp;nbsp;Schwerdtfeger, a fanatical antisemite, sees his people as being ruled by the Jews. He therefore has a law passed by the National Assembly forcing all Jews to emigrate by the end of the year. The law is enthusiastically received by the non-Jewish population, and the Jews leave the country. But after a short time a sober reality makes itself felt. Cultural life becomes impoverished: in the theatres only plays by [[Ludwig Ganghofer]] and [[Ludwig Anzengruber]] are still performed. Many cafes are empty, or are converted into beer halls selling sausages. After an initial upturn, the economy declines, as business has greatly diminished, and has moved to other cities, such as [[Prague]] and [[Budapest]]. Inflation and unemployment run wild.

The political characters of the book (although not of the film, to avoid difficulties with censorship) are delineated in such a way as to be identifiable with real politicians of the period: Bundeskanzler Schwerdtfeger, for example, is based on [[Ignaz Seipel]]. Besides the political action, the film also dwells on the love relationship between Lotte ([[Anny Milety]]), a typical Viennese girl (''Wiener Mädel'') and the daughter of a member of the National Assembly who voted for the banishment of the Jews, and the Jewish artist Leo Strakosch ([[Johannes Riemann]]).

Towards the end of the film, the National Assembly resolves to bring the Jews back again. However, to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority, Lotte and Leo, who has already illegally returned to Austria with forged papers identifying him as a French painter, have to remove the antisemitic parliamentary representative Bernard (played by [[Hans Moser (actor)|Hans Moser]]), which they do by getting him drunk. The drama reaches a peak as he is committed to a psychiatric institution represented in Expressionist scenery, where in a claustrophobic and asymmetrically painted cell, he sees himself threatened by [[Star of David|Stars of David]].

This sequence also represents the divergence of the film from the book, as the action of the film is revealed as a dream of the antisemitic Councillor Bernard. This surprising turn of events was described in the original film program as:
"In this moment of the highest distress Councillor Bernard awakes from his dream, finds himself in the tavern at a very late hour and says to the baffled Volbert: 'Thank God that stupid dream is over—we are all just people and we don't want hate—we want life—we want to live together in peace.'"&lt;ref&gt;''"Gottlob, daß der dumme Traum vorbei ist – wir sind ja alle nur Menschen und wollen keinen Haß – Leben wollen wir – ruhig nebeneinander leben"''. Kivur, Nr. 1346, o.J., o.S.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was made in 1924, about two years after the publication of Bettauer's novel. It differs from the book in several ways: for example, the city in the film is called "Utopia", instead of "Vienna". The film also has conciliatory happy ending, which is not only the exact opposite of the message of the book, but also represents a surprising and abrupt change of direction within the film itself, the whole of which is thus revealed as the dream of an antisemite who at last comes to the realisation that the Jews are a "necessary evil".&lt;ref&gt;''Die Filmwelt'', 1924, n. 14–15, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for these fundamental deviations from the original was to reduce the controversial political impact of the content.

The film was Hans Moser's second cinematic role. The female lead was played, as so often in Breslauer's films, by Anny (or Anna) Milety, whom he later married (in 1925). The well-known Jewish actors [[Gisela Werbisek]] (billed as "Werbezirk") and [[Armin Berg]] appeared only in minor roles, as Kathi the cook and Isidor the commissionaire. The Expressionist backdrops and decor which characterise some scenes were the work of [[Julius von Borsody]].

Other cast members were [[Eugen Neufeld]] (Bundeskanzler Dr. Schwerdtfeger), [[Karl Thema]] (Cllr. Linder), [[Ferdinand Mayerhofer]] (Cllr. Volbert), [[Mizi Griebl]] (Volbert's wife) and [[Hans Effenberger]] (Alois Carroni).

== Performance history ==
The premiere took place on 25 July 1924 in Vienna, although there were still technical problems with the film. Bettauer and Breslauer, the director, fell out entirely, and Bettauer later refused to acknowledge any connection between the film and his book. The technically inferior prints of the film were often manually cut and shortened by the cinema owners themselves. Nevertheless, the cinema auditoriums were often full, although not only in Austria but also in [[Berlin]] (premiere 1926) and [[New York City|New York]] (premiere 1928, where it was shown as ''The City Without Jews''), it was very clear that the success of the film was not as great as that of the book. There were sometimes disturbances at performances: [[Nazism|National Socialists]] often threw stinkbombs into the cinemas; in [[Linz]] the showing of the film was banned.&lt;ref name="korso"&gt;Heimo Halbrainer on [http://www.korso.at/korso/DStmk/bett.htm www.korso.at – Informationsmagazin für die Steiermark], July 2001 (page viewed on 19 January 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

A campaign of vilification against Bettauer was instigated, partly because of this film and partly because of his other activities. In the spring of 1925 he was murdered by a [[Nazi Party]] member, [[Otto Rothstock]], who was hailed as a hero and despite being found guilty of murder, was soon set free.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1933, the film was shown commercially for the last time, again causing a stir, when it was screened in the [[Amsterdam]] theatre ''Carré'' as a protest against Hitler's Germany. This copy of the film is presumably the same as the one discovered in 1991 in the [[Nederlands Filmmuseum]]. It was on a [[cellulose nitrate]] base and on the point of disintegration, as well as being incomplete. The German [[Bundesarchiv]] in [[Coblenz]] therefore made an "emergency copy", which was then reconstructed on behalf of the [[Filmarchiv Austria]] (Austrian Film Archive) by the company HS-ART Digital Service of [[Graz]] using the "DIAMANT" software developed by [[Joanneum Research]]; faded parts were then re-coloured.&lt;ref name="korso"/&gt; In October 2008, the film was made available on a portable medium for the first time as part of the DVD series  ''Der österreichische Film''.

In 2015, a copy of the whole film in excellent condition was found in a flea-market in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Noack |first=Rick |date=March 30, 2018 |title=Long-lost film that predicted rise of anti-Semitism has ominous message for today's world |publisher=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/03/30/long-lost-film-that-warned-of-rise-of-anti-semitism-has-ominous-message-for-todays-world |quote=The film — which sparked furious reactions in the mid-1920s — was believed to have been lost until a copy was discovered in a Paris flea market in 2015.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian Film Archive organised a crowd-funding campaign to save the film to which more than 700 people contributed more than €86,000 (£72,000; $107,000). This full version of the film was digitally restored and re-released in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;(29 March 2018). ''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43569919 'Lost' film predicting rise of Nazism returns to screen]''. [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reaction ==
"In many places the film follows the original book almost word for word, which makes the Utopian ending even more obviously an expression of appeasement. At the end the surprised audience learns that the entire dramatic action only took place in a dream, and thus never really happened. The on-screen happy ending, dictated by compromise, not only negates the meaning of Bettauer's book but also the very real antisemitism that it reflects. Instead it documents a by no means unthinkable and in no way dreamlike reality [...] This surprising turn of the plot, deviating totally from the literary original, which simplifies the action as the content of a dream, cannot merely be regarded as a simple dramatic exigency, but as a prime example of the Austrian soul's ability to repress. This naïve and perhaps crude experiment from 1924 can be taken as a forerunner of what was generally practised after [[World War II]] in the country ''ohne Eigenschaften''"&lt;ref&gt;An allusion to [[Robert Musil]]'s novel ''[[Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften]]'' (English translations as ''The Man Without Qualities''.&lt;/ref&gt;(Thomas Ballhausen, Günter Krenn, 2006).&lt;ref name="medienimpulse"/&gt;

Its members would go on to work on a variety of subsequent projects, including [[New Age Steppers]] and [[Rip Rig + Panic]]. In 2010, the band reunited, touring and releasing new material.

==History==

===Original run (1977–1981)===
The Pop Group was formed in 1977 in Bristol, when teenager [[Mark Stewart (musician)|Mark Stewart]] set out to start a [[funk]] group with schoolmates [[John Waddington (musician)|John Waddington]] and [[Simon Underwood]].&lt;ref name="rollingstone.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AllmusicBio/&gt; Inspired by the energy of [[punk rock]] but feeling the style to be too conservative, the group drew influence from the [[avant-garde]], [[black music]] styles such as [[free jazz]] and [[dub reggae|dub]], and [[radical politics|radical political]] traditions.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=AllmusicBio/&gt; Guitarist [[Gareth Sager]] and drummer [[Bruce Smith (musician)|Bruce Smith]] were eventually added to the group.&lt;ref name=AllmusicBio/&gt; Soon after forming, they began to gain notoriety for their live performances and were subsequently signed to [[Radar Records]].&lt;ref name=AllmusicBio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-pop-group-mn0000487663/biography |title=Artist Biography |last=Dougan |first=John |work=Allmusic |accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appeared on the cover of the ''[[New Musical Express|NME]]''.&lt;ref name="faber"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Simon|title=UK Post-Punk: Faber Forty-Fives: 1977–1982|date=2012|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cnoUux8oxUMC&amp;pg=PT22&amp;lpg=PT22&amp;dq=a+brave+failure+nme+pop+group&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2wuyWHcS3e&amp;sig=C3_14DdA9AJrKCYBv2rMtNbRrrc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjInuKr5-TSAhXKPiYKHVyuA3IQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20brave%20failure%20nme%20pop%20group&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They issued their debut single, "[[She Is Beyond Good and Evil]]," in March 1979 and their debut album, ''[[Y (album)|Y]]'',  in April of that year, both to acclaim but relatively low sales figures.&lt;ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/&gt; Regardless, their moderate success was sufficient to convince [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] to sign the band. During this period, [[Dan Catsis]] replaced Underwood on bass.&lt;ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/&gt;

The band's career with Rough Trade commenced with the release of the single "[[We Are All Prostitutes (song)|We Are All Prostitutes]]." This was followed by the release of their second album, ''[[For How Much Longer Do We Tolerate Mass Murder?]]'' (1980). Shortly afterwards the Pop Group released a split single, "[[In the Beginning There Was Rhythm/Where There's a Will There's a Way|Where There's a Will...]]", with [[the Slits]], a band with whom they now shared a drummer (Bruce Smith) and manager Dick O'Dell. The band's last live performance was in 1980 to a crowd of 500,000 people at [[Trafalgar Square]] as part of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] protest.&lt;ref name="rollingstone.com" /&gt; They split in 1981, after legal wranglings and internal disagreements. Members of the group went on to collaborate and join bands including [[Pigbag]], [[Maximum Joy]], [[Head (band)|Head]], [[the Slits]] and [[Rip Rig + Panic]], the latter notable for the involvement of [[Neneh Cherry]].&lt;ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/&gt; Stewart collaborated with the [[On-U Sound]] posse, issuing records backed by the Maffia, then as a solo artist.

===Reformation (2010–present)===
It was reported on 24 May 2010 that the Pop Group would be reuniting and touring, with three of the original five members returning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/update-the-pop-group-to-reunite,41354/|title=Update: The Pop Group to reunite|publisher=''[[The A.V. Club]]''|date=24 May 2010|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pop Group's 1980 LP ''[[We Are Time]]'' saw its first reissue worldwide on 20 October 2014. The band also released a compilation of rarities titled ''[[Cabinet of Curiosities (album)|Cabinet of Curiosities]]''. In support of the reissues the band undertook a 7-day UK tour.  On 23 February 2015, the Pop Group released ''[[Citizen Zombie]]'', their first studio album in 35 years. They subsequently undertook a worldwide tour, performing dates in the US, Japan, and Australia. An extensive European tour culminated in festival appearances including two live sets at Glastonbury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/premiere-the-pop-group-citizen-zombie|title=Premiere: The Pop Group – "Citizen Zombie"|work=NOISEY|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

February 2016 saw the reissue of their 1980 album ''For How Much Longer Do We Tolerate Mass Murder?'', released on CD and digitally for the first time. This was accompanied by the release of a colour vinyl edition of "We Are All Prostitutes," referred to by ''[[The Vinyl Factory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thevinylfactory.com/vinyl-factory-releases/the-10-best-vinyl-releases-this-week-22nd-february/|title=The 10 best vinyl releases this week (22nd February)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A previously unseen video for "We Are All Prostitutes", shot at the Electric Ballroom in November 1979 but thought to be lost, was recovered from the attic of video artist Chris Reynolds and unveiled. In May, the band released a collection of live recordings, entitled ''[[The Boys Whose Head Exploded]]''. In July 2016, the band announced they were teaming once again with producer [[Dennis Bovell]] to record a new album.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepopgroup.net/in-the-studio-working-on-a-new-album-with-dennis-bovell-hank-shocklee/|title=The Pop Group – Back In The Studio With Dennis Bovell &amp; Hank Shocklee|website=www.thepopgroup.net|access-date=2016-08-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904192632/http://www.thepopgroup.net/in-the-studio-working-on-a-new-album-with-dennis-bovell-hank-shocklee/|archivedate=4 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 August, the band revealed the title would be ''[[Honeymoon On Mars]]'', and that it would be released on 28 October via the Freaks R Us label. They also revealed the track listing and album artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/08/31/the-pop-group-announce-new-album-honeymoon-on-mars/|title=The Pop Group announce new album Honeymoon On Mars|website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.|access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepopgroup.net/fact-magazine-announce-details-of-new-album-uk-eu-tour-dates/|title=The Pop Group – FACT Magazine Announce Details of New Album &amp; UK + EU Tour Dates|website=www.thepopgroup.net|access-date=2016-08-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913110110/http://www.thepopgroup.net/fact-magazine-announce-details-of-new-album-uk-eu-tour-dates/|archivedate=13 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September, the first single from the album, "Zipperface" was released to streaming services, [[YouTube]], and [[iTunes]].

==Style and influence==
The Pop Group have been called pioneers of the late-’70s [[post-punk]] movement.&lt;ref name="Everhart"/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that the Pop Group "almost singlehandedly effected the transition from punk to post-punk," noting that they "– ahead of [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], [[PiL]], [[A Certain Ratio]] and the rest – steered punk towards a radical, politicised mash-up of [[Dub music|dub]], [[funk]], [[free jazz]] and the avant-garde."&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/26/the-pop-group-new-album-citizen-zombie|title=Have the Pop Group finally become a pop group?|first=Paul|last=Lester|date=26 February 2015|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louder Than War (website)|Louder Than War]] called them "one of the most wildly innovative and barrier-shattering bands to emerge from the late ’70s post-punk era."&lt;ref name="louderthanwar"&gt;{{cite web |first=Guy |last=Manchester |url=http://louderthanwar.com/legendary-post-punk-band-the-pop-group-release-video-for-colour-blind-34-years-after-its-initial-release/ |title=Legendary Post Punk Band The Pop Group Release Video for Colour Blind |publisher=Louder Than War |date=2014 |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the group as "an explosive mutant gene," asserting that "among their rabble-rousing post-punk contemporaries, none boasted as much sheer musical inventiveness and audacity."&lt;ref name="rollingstone.com"/&gt; Theorist [[Mark Fisher (theorist)|Mark Fisher]] describes their sound as "both cavernous and propulsive, ultra-abstract yet driven by [[dance music]]’s physical imperatives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factmagazine.co.uk/da/60020 |title=Stealing Fire: The Pop Group`S `Y` Lp: Fact Magazine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318133521/http://www.factmagazine.co.uk/da/60020 |archivedate=18 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Hagan"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sean |last=O'Hagan | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/sep/14/pop-group | title=The Pop Group: Still Blazing a Trail That Makes Rock Look Conservative |date=14 September 2010 | accessdate=11 September 2014 | publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was inspired by diverse musical sources as diverse as [[Ornette Coleman]], [[King Tubby]], [[Debussy]], [[Funkadelic]], [[Jacques Brel]], and [[Steve Reich]] in addition to non-musical sources such as [[French romanticism]], [[Antonin Artaud]], [[Beat poetry]], the [[Situationists]],&lt;ref name="faber"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Simon|title=UK Post-Punk: Faber Forty-Fives: 1977–1982|date=2012|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cnoUux8oxUMC&amp;pg=PT22&amp;lpg=PT22&amp;dq=a+brave+failure+nme+pop+group&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2wuyWHcS3e&amp;sig=C3_14DdA9AJrKCYBv2rMtNbRrrc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjInuKr5-TSAhXKPiYKHVyuA3IQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20brave%20failure%20nme%20pop%20group&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freaks R Us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freaksrus.net/management/the-pop-group/|title=THE POP GROUP – Freaks R Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Reynolds&gt;{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Reynolds |year=2006 |title=[[Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984]] |location=London |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |isbn=978-0-571-21570-6 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/mark-stewart-mn0000276849|title=Mark Stewart – Biography, Albums, &amp; Streaming Radio – AllMusic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[existentialism|existential philosophy]].&lt;ref name="O'Hagan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/the-pop-group-mark-stewart-interview|title=The Pop Group Are Back and Fighting Against the "Warm Bath of Apathy"|work=NOISEY|accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing their early work, Mark Fisher wrote that "The Pop Group of ''Y'' were not interested in either shaking their fists at authority or in announcing their boredom and dejection. They wanted to re-mystify, not de-mystify, to combat the stupidities and atrocities of the world with new forms of fascination."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Fisher (theorist)|Fisher, Mark]].

==Background==
Patterson began writing ''The Quants'' in 2008. He was first exposed to the [[Quantitative analysis (finance)|quantitative analysis]] [[investment strategies]] while covering the [[financial industry]] for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=min&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Greg|title=The Quants: Q&amp;A With Scott Patterson|url=http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/quants-scott-patterson-fat-tails-todd/4/13/2010/id/27748|publisher=Minyanville|date=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he became more acquainted with the players involved, he found that many of the most successful quants knew each other and carried similar eccentricities.&lt;ref name=min/&gt; Realizing this was a world that the average investor knew little of, Patterson wrote the book to shed light on the strategies, players, and related risks of such trading strategies.&lt;ref name=min/&gt;

==Synopsis==
The introduction to ''The Quants'' describes the real-life, annual, high-stakes [[poker]] match between Wall Street's hedge fund managers, comparing their trading styles to their poker strategies.&lt;ref name=sa&gt;{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Scott|title=How Math Whizzes Helped Sink the Economy]|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=quants-book|publisher=Scientific American|date=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on, among other things, the 2007 [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and how it helped trigger a sudden and massive unwind of complex, highly leveraged quantitative strategies. The book also delves into critical short-comings of many quantitative strategies, such as their tendency to lead to crowded trades and their underestimation of the likelihood of chaotic, volatile moves in the markets.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite web|last=Sender|first=Henny|title=Wall St maths geniuses whose models did not add up|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d0fbfad4-16ad-11df-aa09-00144feab49a.html#axzz223gU2rnb|publisher=Financial Times|date=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also delves into the background of the various vanguards of quantitative analysis. It tells the history  of ''Beat the Market'' &amp; ''Beat the Dealer'' author [[Edward O.

'''''The Slav Epic''''' ({{lang-cs|Slovanská epopej}}) is a cycle of 20 large canvases painted by [[Czechs|Czech]] [[Art Nouveau]] painter [[Alfons Mucha]] between 1910 and 1928. The cycle depicts the mythology and history of Czechs and other [[Slavic peoples]]. In 1928, after finishing his monumental work, Mucha bestowed the cycle upon the city of [[Prague]] on condition that the city build a special pavilion for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epopej.cz/epopej_gb.html|title=The Slav Epic|work=[[Moravský Krumlov]]|accessdate=11 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727071856/http://epopej.cz/epopej_gb.html|archivedate=27 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="battle"/&gt; Prior to 2012, the work was a part of the permanent exhibition at the chateau in the town of [[Moravský Krumlov]] in the [[South Moravian Region]] of the [[Czech Republic]]. In 2012, all 20 works were moved and displayed together on the ground floor of the ''Veletržní Palace'' till 2016, in an exhibition organized by the [[National Gallery in Prague]] (exhibition catalogue: Alfons Mucha – Slovanská epopej).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kultura.idnes.cz/vytvarne-umeni.aspx?c=A120510_171508_vytvarneum_jaz|title=Muchově Epopeji to ve Veletržním paláci až nečekaně sluší|last=Hnátek|first=Václav |date=10 May 2012|work=iDnes|publisher=[[Mladá fronta DNES]]|language=Czech|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Alphons Mucha spent many years working on ''The Slav Epic'' cycle, which he considered his life's masterwork. He had dreamed of completing such a series, a celebration of Slavic history, since the turn of the 20th century; however, his plans were limited by financial constraints. In 1909, he managed to obtain grants by an American philanthropist and keen admirer of the Slavic culture, [[Charles Richard Crane]].&lt;ref name=tyden&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/kultura/vytvarne-umeni/slovanska-epopej-na-ceste-do-prahy-muchovi-nepatri_172447.html|title=Slovanská epopej na cestě do Prahy. Muchovi nepatří|publisher=Týden.cz|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began by visiting the places he intended to depict in the cycle: Russia, Poland and the Balkans, including the Orthodox monasteries of [[Mount Athos]]. Additionally, he consulted historians regarding details of historical events in order to ensure an accurate depiction. In 1910, he rented part of the castle in [[Zbiroh]] and began working on the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tn.nova.cz/zpravy/domaci/slovanska-epopej-se-zatim-stehovat-nebude-rozhodl-soud.html|title=Slovanská epopej se zatím stěhovat nebude. Krumlovští se brání|work=TV Nova|language=Czech|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mucha continued working on the cycle for 18 years, gradually submitting paintings to the city of Prague as he completed them. In 1919, the first part of the series comprising eleven canvases was displayed in the Prague's [[Clementinum]]. In 1921, five of the paintings were shown in New York and Chicago to great public acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayer|first=Derek|title=The Coasts of Bohemia: A Czech History|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, the complete cycle was displayed for the first time in the Trade Fair Palace in Prague, the Czechoslovak capital.

Alfons Mucha died in July, 1939. Shortly before his death he was interrogated by the [[Gestapo]], as he was an important exponent of public life in [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/37455|title=Alfons Mucha|last=Carey|first=Nick|date=9 February 2000|publisher=Radio Prague|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, the ''Slav Epic'' was wrapped and hidden away to prevent seizure by the Nazis.&lt;ref name="battle"/&gt;

Following the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]] and subsequent communist takeover of the country, Mucha was considered a decadent and bourgeois artist, estranged from the ideals of [[socialist realism]].&lt;ref name=rozhlas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/cro6/komentare/_zprava/763677|title=Slovanská epopej v mlhách|last=Konrád|first=Ondřej|date=26 July 2010|publisher=Český rozhlas 6|language=Czech|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building of a special pavilion for the exposition of the Slav Epic cycle became irrelevant and unimportant for the new communist regime.&lt;ref name=rozhlas/&gt; After the war, the paintings were moved to the chateau at Moravský Krumlov by a group of local patriots, and the cycle went on display there in 1963.&lt;ref name="battle"/&gt;

== Controversy ==
The city of Prague has waged a decade-long legal battle over the work which intensified in early 2010.&lt;ref name="battle"/&gt; Much consideration has been given to relocating the Slav Epic from Moravský Krumlov (where it had been displayed for almost 50 years), to Prague. The hope was that Prague, a city frequented by many thousands of tourists, would attract increased attention to the series of paintings. However, there is no suitable space for the work in Prague's galleries. Therefore, some Czech state institutions, such as the Office of the [[Václav Klaus|President of the Czech Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/do-sporu-o-epopej-se-vlozil-klaus-chce-aby-zustala-na-morave-p45-/domaci.asp?c=A100728_173206_domaci_jw|title=Do sporu o epopej se vložil Klaus. Chce, aby zůstala na Moravě|publisher=[[iDNES]].cz|work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic|language=Czech|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; found it preferable to leave the paintings in their current location since there have been few problems there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/kultura/vytvarne-umeni/muchova-slovanska-epopej-do-prahy-zatim-nepresidli_104790.html Muchova Slovanská epopej do Prahy zatím nepřesídlí]; [[Týden]].cz ''(in Czech)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://brno.idnes.cz/muchova-slovanska-epopej-stale-nema-v-praze-misto-dalsi-jednani-se-chysta-na-rijen-gio-/brno-zpravy.asp?c=A090909_171620_brno_trr Muchova Slovanská epopej stále nemá v Praze místo, další jednání se chystá na říjen]; [[iDnes]].cz ''(in Czech)''&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in early 2010, the city of Prague requested the return of the Slav Epic for restoration work and subsequent display.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/cz/clanek/130019 Loss of Mucha art work likely to hit small Moravian town hard]; Radio.cz&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Mucha Foundation, run by the artist's grandson John Mucha and his mother Geraldine, blocked the move as it would simply be a provisional measure.&lt;ref name="battle"/&gt; The City of Prague argued that not Alfons Mucha but [[Charles R. Crane]] was the owner of the paintings and that he has donated the cycle to the City of Prague. According to the newspaper [[Mladá fronta DNES]], the information was proved by contracts found in the city archives.&lt;ref name=tyden/&gt; The Foundation is in talks with the City of Prague for the construction of a permanent home for the work.&lt;ref name="battle"/&gt;

On 25 July 2010, over a thousand people gathered in Moravský Krumlov to protest the planned move of ''The Slav Epic'' from the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brno.idnes.cz/proti-stehovani-epopeje-protestovalo-v-moravskem-krumlove-tisic-lidi-1mj-/brno-zpravy.asp?c=A100725_164201_brno-zpravy_bor|title=Proti stěhování epopeje protestovalo v Moravském Krumlově tisíc lidí|work=Mladá fronta DNES |location=Czech Republic|language=Czech|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a two-year dispute between Prague and the Moravian town of Moravský Krumlov, the renowned cycle of 20 monumental canvases was—in a move protested by conservationists and art historians alike—taken for display at the National Gallery's Veletržní Palace in 2012 and remained there until the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mucha’s "Slav Epic" moved to Prague without approval|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Mucha-s-Slav-Epic-moved-to-Prague-without-approval/26284}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, ''The Slav Epic'' was shown in Brno during the RE:PUBLIKA Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gotobrno.cz/en/festival/republika-festival/|title=RE:PUBLIKA Festival –  – Go To Brno|date=27 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibition combines two opposing worlds of renowned Art Nouveau artist Alfons Mucha’s works – the majestic Slav Epic and a unique collection of posters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gotobrno.cz/en/actions/slovanska-epopej-slav-epic/|title=Alfons Mucha: Two worlds – Go To Brno|date=21 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TheStoryOfArt.jpg|thumb|First edition]]
'''''The Story of Art''''', by [[Ernst Gombrich|E. H. Gombrich]], is a survey of the [[art history|history of art]] from ancient times to the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Gombrich|E. H. Gombrich]] (2006), ''The Story of Art'', London: [[Phaidon Press]], 978-0-7148-324-70&lt;/ref&gt;

First published in 1950 by [[Phaidon Press|Phaidon]], the book is widely regarded both as a seminal work of criticism and as one of the most accessible introductions to the [[visual arts]]. It was originally intended for younger readers. Over seven million copies have been sold, making it the best selling art book of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/17/story-of-art-eh-gombrich Picture perfect.] William Skidelsky, ''[[The Observer]]'', 17 May 2009. theguardian.com Retrieved 5 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently in its 16th edition and has been translated into approximately 30 languages.

==Summary==
The book is divided into an introduction, 27 chapters each dealing with a defined time period of art history within one or several cultural/geographic contexts, and a concluding chapter summarizing the latest developments in visual arts. The first chapter starts examining [[prehistoric art]] and native cultures. The next four chapters are dedicated to the greater ancient cultures, especially Greece and Rome. Starting with chapter 8, Gombrich then begins to focus on Central European art, returning to a more global view in chapter 24 that deals with art of the late 18th and early 19th century in England, France and America. A striking property of ''The Story of Art'' is the amount of illustrations it contains, with more than 50% of the book's pages devoted to color photographs of paintings, drawings, architecture and sculptures. In the preface, Gombrich explains that it has been his intention not to mention any work of art that he could not also include as an illustration.

The first two sentences of the book have become famous: ″There really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists.″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gombrich|first1=E. H.|title=The Story of Art|date=1984|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-850066-5|page=4|edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gombrich later elaborated on this statement by saying that he defines "art" based on its Latin root, meaning "skill," and that there is "no disembodied skill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carrier|first1=David|title=Gombrich and Danto on Defining Art|journal=The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1996|volume=54|issue=3|page=279|jstor=431629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Berkeley.jpg|thumb|right|upright|George Berkeley]]
'''''Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous''''', or simply '''''Three Dialogues''''', is a 1713 book on [[metaphysics]] and [[idealism]] written by [[George Berkeley]]. Taking the form of a dialogue, the book was written as a response to the criticism Berkeley experienced after publishing ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]''.&lt;ref name="Turbayne"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Turbayne| first=C. M.| authorlink=Colin Murray Turbayne| title=Berkeley's Two Concepts of Mind| journal=[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]| volume=20| issue=1|  date=September 1959| pages=85–92| jstor=2104957| doi=10.2307/2104957}} &lt;br /&gt; Repr. in {{cite book| last1=Engle| first1=Gale| last2=Taylor| first2=Gabriele| title=Berkeley's Principles of Human Knowledge: Critical Studies| location=Belmont, CA| publisher=Wadsworth| year=1968| pages=24–33}} In this collection of essays, Turbayne's work comprised two papers that had been published in [[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]:
* "Berkeley's Two Concepts of Mind"
* C. Turbayne's reply to [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2105263 S.A. Grave "A Note on Berkeley's Conception of the Mind"] ([[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]], 1962, vol. 22, No. 4).
&lt;/ref&gt;

Three important concepts discussed in the ''Three Dialogues'' are [[perception|perceptual]] relativity, the conceivability/[[master argument]]{{efn|"master argument" was coined by André Gallois&lt;ref&gt;A. Gallois, [http://su-ltd.mylivepage.ru/file/2716/6135_Gallois_on_Berkeley.djvu "Berkeley's Master Argument."] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714063318/http://su-ltd.mylivepage.ru/file/2716/6135_Gallois_on_Berkeley.djvu |date=2012-07-14 }} ''The Philosophical Review'' 83 (1974), pp. 55-69&lt;/ref&gt;}} and Berkeley's [[phenomenalism]]. Perceptual relativity argues that the same object can appear to have different characteristics (e.g. shape) depending on the observer's [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]]. Since objective features of objects cannot change without an inherent change in the object itself, shape must not be an objective feature.

==Background==

In 1709, Berkeley published his first major work, ''[[s:An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision|An Essay towards a New Theory of Vision]]'', in which he discussed the limitations of human vision and advanced the theory that the proper objects of sight are not material objects, but light and colour.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book |last=Berkeley |first=George |year=1709 |contribution= |title= An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision |edition= 2 |publisher=Jeremy Pepyat  |publication-date=1709 |publication-place=Dublin  |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1o85AAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3AdyOzLl2K0NEC&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |accessdate=12 July 2014 }} via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; This foreshadowed his chief philosophical work, ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (1710), which, after its poor reception, he rewrote into the ''Three Dialogues'' (1713).&lt;ref name="Turbayne"/&gt;

==Hylas and Philonous==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
Berkeley's views are represented by Philonous (Greek: "lover of mind"), while [[Hylas]] (Greek: "matter") embodies the Irish thinker's opponents, in particular [[John Locke]].

In The First Dialogue, Hylas expresses his disdain for [[skepticism]], adding that he has heard Philonous to have "maintained the most extravagant opinion... namely, that there is no such thing as ''material substance'' in the world."  Philonous argues that it is actually Hylas who is the skeptic and that he can prove it. Thus, a philosophical battle of wit begins.

Philonous questions Hylas systematically regarding what humans know of the world, first examining secondary qualities, such as heat, to show that such qualities do not exist outside the individual mind. He then moves on to primary qualities such as extension and shape, and likewise argues that they, too, are dependent entirely on one's [[perception]] (e.g., From a distance, a great mountain appears to be small, and the shape of a thing may change dramatically under a microscope).

Hylas's view of matter (which has its origin in the Platonic theory of forms [http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2f.htm], or abstract entities that exist outside of the sensible world){{citation needed|date=October 2013}} is systematically destroyed by Philonous (Berkeley).  The basic argument is that because matter is only known to us by its sensible qualities, it is impossible to describe or even imagine matter without these qualities.  For in the absence of sensible qualities, matter, by definition, loses its essential qualities.

Berkeley's argument goes further: sensible qualities are not inherent in matter. Rather, they are ascribed and understood by the mind.  Color, sound, temperature and even shape are qualities entirely dependent on a mind.  Indeed, without a "mind," it becomes impossible to imagine "matter."  The answer to the question, "If a tree falls in the forest and no mind is present, does it make a noise?" is answered by Berkeley's immaterialism: There is no tree.  However, God is always perceiving everything.  In other words, there is ''always'' a mind present.  A human (and thus a human mind) need not be present for the tree to make a sound, for the mind of God is always present, or so Berkeley argues.  It is this mind of God that gives sensible qualities to matter, not matter itself.

In his own time Berkeley faced opposition from many philosophers who held to the Platonic view.  These philosophers thought Berkeley vulgar because his own view seemed to confirm the views held by the lower classes.  Roughly speaking, the "common view" was that God created everything and that the things on earth were the real things.  Some philosophers did not believe in God, and believed matter on earth was but an imitation of actual matter that existed in another dimension.  Berkeley sided with the common view.

The philosophy presented is often misinterpreted.  The criticism is that Berkeley claims that we live in an illusory world, when in fact, Berkeley advocates for the acceptance of ideas as real "things."  When we refer to an object, we don't refer to a material form, but to the idea of the object that informs our senses.  Berkeley doesn't propose that ''nothing'' is real; he proposes that ''ideas themselves'' compose reality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7972">'''Transnational cinema''' is a developing concept within [[film studies]] that encompasses a range of theories relating to the effects of [[globalization]] upon the cultural and economic aspects of film. It incorporates the debates and influences of [[postnationalism]], [[postcolonialism]], [[consumerism]] and [[Third cinema]],&lt;ref name="one"&gt;Dennison, S. &amp; Lim, S.H. (2006). Situating World Cinema as a Theoretical Problem. In Dennison, S &amp; Lim, S. H. (eds). 'Remapping World Cinema: Identity, Culture and Politics in Film'. (pp.1-15) London &amp; New York: Wallflower Press.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst many other topics.

Transnational cinema debates consider the development and subsequent effect of films, cinemas and directors which span national boundaries.

==Key debates==

A key argument of transnational cinema is the necessity for a redefinition, or even refutation, of the concept of a [[national cinema]]. National identity has been posited as an 'imaginary community' that in reality is formed of many separate and fragmented communities defined more by [[social class]], [[economic class]], sexuality, gender, [[generation]], religion, [[ethnicity]], political belief and fashion, than [[nationality]].&lt;ref name="five"&gt;Higson, A. (2006). The Limiting Imagination of National Cinema. In Ezra, E. &amp; Rowden, T. (eds.) 'Transnational Cinema, the Reader' (pp.15-26). Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasingly transnational practices in film funding, production and distribution combined with the 'imagined community' thus provide the basis for an argued shift towards a greater use of transnational, rather than national, perspectives within [[film studies]].&lt;ref name="five"/&gt; Global communication through the internet has also resulted in changes within culture and has further resulted in film transcending perceived national boundaries.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;Shefrin, E. (2006). Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and Participatory Fandom: Mapping New Congruencies Between the Internet and Media Entertainment Culture. In Ezra, E. &amp; Rowden, T. (eds.) 'Transnational Cinema, the Reader' (pp.73-80). Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
The concept of transnational cinema is important because it will be able to change how films from different cultures are approached. Mostly the approach is Eurocentric and the field of studying cinema is full of biases. It is mainly about how western culture views eastern culture.

Defining transnational cinema must be done carefully. It should challenge and criticize [[Orientalism]] that is rooted in film studies. It should be also differentiated from world cinema, which marks cinemas from countries that are not Anglo-phone as "others" and bind them in one category without realizing that they each have unique culture and identity.

"In the study of films, a critical transnationalism does not ghettoize transnational film-making in interstitial and marginal spaces but rather interrogates how these film-making activities negotiate with the national on all levels – from cultural policy to financial sources, from the multiculturalism of difference to how it reconfigures the nation’s image of itself."&lt;ref&gt;Higbee, W. and Lim, S. H. (2010), ‘Concepts of transnational cinema: towards
a critical transnationalism in film studies’, Transnational Cinemas 1: 1,
pp. 7–21, doi: 10.1386/trac.1.1.7/1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ongoing definition==

The broad scope of topics relating to Transnational cinema have raised some criticisms over its exact definition, as Mette Hjort notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(...) to date the discourse of cinematic transnationalism has been characterized less by competing theories and approaches than by a tendency to use the term ‘transnational’ as a largely self-evident qualifier requiring only minimal conceptual clarification.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;Hjort, M. (Forthcoming, 2009). On the Plurality of Cinematic Transnationalism. In Newman, K &amp; Durovicova, N . (eds.) 'World Cinemas, Transnational Perspectives'. London: Routledge/American Film Institute Reader.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Subsequently, Hjort, John Hess and Patricia R. Zimmermann,&lt;ref name="three"&gt;Hess, J. &amp; Zimmermann, P. (2006). Transnational Documentaries: An Introduction. In Ezra, E. &amp; Rowden, T. (eds.) 'Transnational Cinema, the Reader' (pp.97-108). Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; amongst others, have attempted to clearly define the utilisation and implementation of Transnational cinema theories. To assist the ongoing discussions, ''Transnational Cinemas'', the first Academic Journal dedicated to the ongoing debates, has been announced by Intellect for publication in 2010.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;[http://www.dur.ac.uk/hispanists/transnational-cinemas.pdf call for submissions on Durham University Hispanists Society page]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vivat ribbons''' ({{lang-de|Vivatbänder}}) were [[silk]] [[ribbon]]s issued to raise money for the [[German Red Cross|Red Cross]] in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]  during [[World War I]]&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vivat ribbons |url=http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/tgm012556/ |website=www.loc.gov |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Ribbons had printed patriotic messages which celebrated battles and important events, as well as royalty and the military leaders. They were designed by many famous German artists of the period.  Most ribbons had the same size and followed the same design pattern with word "''{{lang|la|[[Vivat]]}}!''" ("''Long live!''") printed on top, followed by unique text and graphic below.  The bottom of the ribbon showed "''{{lang|de|Zum Besten Des Roten Kreuzes; Verlag Amsler u. Ruthardt; Berlin W8}}''" ("''To the benefit of the Red Cross; Verlag Amsler &amp; Ruthardt; Berlin W8''") text, since they were released by the [[German Red Cross]] to raise funds for war relief. During [[World War I]] 200 thousands ribbons were sold &lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Academische Monatshefte|Academische Monatshefte]] XXIX (1913), S. 407&lt;/ref&gt; and they become popular [[Collectable|collectors items]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7952">The word '''''womyn''''' is one of several [[alternative political spelling|alternative spellings]] of the [[English language|English]] word ''[[women]]'' used by some [[feminists]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Hatton. [http://eric.ed.gov/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/14/9c/da.pdf "Womyn and the 'L': A Study of the Relationship between Communication Apprehension, Gender, and Bulletin Boards"] &lt;sup&gt;([http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED397454&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED397454 abstract])&lt;/sup&gt;, ''[[Education Resources Information Center]]'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; There are other spellings, including '''''womban''''' (a reference to the [[womb]]) or '''''womon''''' (singular), and '''''wimmin''''' (plural). Some writers who use such alternative spellings, avoiding the [[suffix]] {{nobr|"-man"}} or {{nobr|"-men"}}, see them as an expression of female independence and a repudiation of traditions that define women by reference to [[male as norm|a male norm]].&lt;ref name="neeru"&gt;Neeru Tandon (2008). ''Feminism: A Paradigm Shift''&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, "womyn" and other spelling variants were associated with [[regional dialect]]s (e.g. [[Scottish English|Scots]]) and [[eye dialect]] (e.g. [[African American Vernacular English]]).

==Old English==
{{main|Woman#Etymology}}
[[Old English]] had a system of [[grammatical gender]], whereby every [[noun]] was treated as either masculine, feminine or neuter, similar to modern German. In Old English sources, the word ''man'' was neuter. One of its meanings was similar to the [[modern English]] usage of "[[One (pronoun)|one]]" as a gender-neutral [[indefinite pronoun]] (compare with ''mankind'' (''man''&amp;nbsp;+ ''kind''), which means the human race).&lt;ref&gt;In Latin similarly, there is "''homo''" or "''hominis''" then "''vir''" or "''viris''" and "''mulier''" or "''mulieris''"; respectively meaning "man" (gender-neutral) then "adult male" and "adult female".&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''wer'' and ''wyf'' were used, when necessary, to specify a man or woman, respectively. Combining them into ''wer-man'' or ''wyf-man'' expressed the concept of "any man" or "any woman".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dale Spender|Spender, Dale]]. ''Man-Made Language''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Casey, and Kate Swift. ''The Handbook of Non-Sexist Language''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminist writers have suggested that this more symmetrical usage reflected more egalitarian notions of gender at the time.&lt;ref name="neeru"/&gt;

==18th, 19th, and early 20th century uses==
The term ''wimmin'' was considered by [[George Philip Krapp|George P. Krapp]] (1872–1934), an American scholar of English, to be [[eye dialect]], the literary technique of using nonstandard spelling that implies a pronunciation of the given word that is actually standard. The spelling indicates that the character's speech overall is [[dialect]]al, foreign, or uneducated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Walpole|1974|pp=193, 195}}{{incomplete short citation|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rickford|Rickford|2000|p=23}}{{incomplete short citation|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of nonstandard spelling differs from others in that a difference in spelling does not indicate a difference in pronunciation of a word.  That is, it is dialect to the eye rather than to the ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://homepage.ntlworld.com/vivian.c/SpellingNovel/EyeDialect.htm |title= Eye Dialect by Vivian Cook |work= Homepage.ntlworld.com |date=  |accessdate= 2012-06-13 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121023154323/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/vivian.c/SpellingNovel/EyeDialect.htm |archivedate= 2012-10-23 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It suggests that a character "would use a vulgar pronunciation if there were one" and "is at the level of ignorance where one misspells in this fashion, hence mispronounces as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bolinger|1946|p=337}}{{incomplete short citation|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''womyn'' appeared as an [[Older Scots]] spelling of ''woman''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?dtext=dboth&amp;query=Woman DOST: Woman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511161408/http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?dtext=dboth&amp;query=Woman |date=2013-05-11 }}&lt;!--webarchive:0;archiveis:1@VDoKC--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Scots language|Scots]] poetry of [[James Hogg]]. The word ''wimmin'' appeared in 19th-century renderings of [[Black American English]], without any feminist significance.

==Current usage in the United States==
The usage of "womyn" as a feminist spelling of ''women'' (with ''womon'' as the singular form) first appeared in print in 1976 referring to the first [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;"Womyn". ''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; This is just after the founding of the [[Mountain Moving Coffeehouse for Womyn and Children]], a [[lesbian feminist]] social event centred around [[women's music]]. Both the annual "MichFest" and the weekly [[coffeehouse (event)|coffeehouse]] operated a [[womyn-born womyn]] policy.&lt;ref name="advocate1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Molloy|first=Parker Marie|title=Equality Michigan Petitions Michfest to End Exclusionary Policy|url=https://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/07/29/equality-michigan-petitions-michfest-end-exclusionary-policy|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|date=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Womyn's land]] was another usage of the term, associated with [[separatist feminism]].

[[Z. Budapest]] promoted the use of word ''wimmin'' (singular ''womon'') in the 1970s as part of her [[Dianic Wicca]] movement, which claims that present-day [[patriarchy]] represents a fall from a matriarchal [[golden age]].&lt;ref&gt;Eugene V. Gallagher, W. Michael Ashcraft (2006). ''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

These re-spellings existed alongside the use of [[herstory]], a feminist re-examination and re-telling of history. Later, another wave of female-produced music was known as the [[riot grrrl]] movement.

The word "womyn" has been criticized by [[Transgender rights movement|trans activists]]&lt;ref name="advocate1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What They Call "Womyn-Only" Space is Really Cisgender-Only Space|url=http://transadvocate.com/what-they-call-womyn-only-space-is-really-cisgender-only-space_n_6289.htm|publisher=The TransAdvocate|date=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its usage in [[Feminist views on transgender topics#Feminist exclusion of trans women|trans-exclusionary radical feminist]] circles which exclude [[trans women]] from identifying into the category of "woman" and consequently prevent them from accessing spaces and resources for women.&lt;ref name="advocate1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vasquez|first=Tina|title=It's Time to End the Long History of Feminism Failing Transgender Women|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/its-time-end-long-history-feminism-failing-transgender-women|publisher=[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]|date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current usage in the United Kingdom==
[[Millie Tant]], a fictional character in the British satirical comic ''[[Viz (comic)|Viz]]'', often used the term ''wimmin'' when discussing women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;Maconie, Stuart. ''Pies and Prejudice: In search of the North''. Edbuty, 2008. p. 132. {{ISBN|978-0-09-191023-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
