The following is an overview of the events of '''2011 in film''', including the highest-grossing films, film festivals, award ceremonies and a list of films released and notable deaths.

More film [[sequel]]s were released in 2011 than any other year before it, with 28 sequels released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3063|title=2011 Preview: Sequels - Now, More Than Ever|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic Scout Tafoya considers 2011 as the best year for cinema, countering the notion of [[1939 in film|1939]] being film's best year overall and citing important developments in cinematic expression during 2011.

==Evaluation of the year==
[[Richard Brody]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' observed that the best films of 2011 "exalt the metaphysical, the fantastical, the transformative, the fourth-wall-breaking, or simply the impossible, and—remarkably—do so .... These films depart from 'reality' ... not in order to forget the irrefutable but in order to face it, to think about it, to act on it more freely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Ryan|title=Richard Brody names "The 26 Best Films of 2011"|url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/2011/12/07/richard-brody-names-the-26-best-films-of-2011/|website=[[Sasha Stone|Awards Daily]]|publisher=Sasha Stone|accessdate=18 September 2016|date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic and filmmaker Scout Tafoya of ''[[RogerEbert.com]]'' considers the year of 2011 as the best year for cinema, countering the notion of [[1939 in film|1939]] being film's best year overall, citing examples such as ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'', ''[[The Tree of Life (film)|The Tree of Life]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time in Anatolia]]'', ''[[Keyhole (film)|Keyhole]]'', ''[[Contagion (film)|Contagion]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (film)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'', and ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]''. He stated that "2011 housed not just some of the greatest art films of our age, but a revolution in the language of blockbuster filmmaking. One big-budget action film after another used digital cameras to show the world behind explosions in starker, stranger light, while constructing a backbone of classical ideas and images."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tafoya|first1=Scout|title=The Unloved, Part 24: "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/mzs/the-unloved-part-24-sherlock-holmes-a-game-of-shadows|website=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=18 September 2016|date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Academy of Performing Arts in Sarajevo''' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]: ''Akademija scenskih umjentosti Sarajevo'') is a faculty within the [[University of Sarajevo]] in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], dedicated to the [[performing arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detail.de/artikel_archipelagos-academy-of-performing-arts-sarajevo_22467_En.htm/|title=Detail.de: ''Academy of Performing Arts in Sarajevo''(in Bosnian) &amp;#91;cited February 21, 2012&amp;#93;|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106064826/http://www.detail.de/artikel_archipelagos-academy-of-performing-arts-sarajevo_22467_En.htm#|archive-date=2012-01-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy of Performing Arts in Sarajevo was officially opened in 1981 with the inaugural Department of [[Acting]]. This was followed by the opening of the Department of [[Theatre director|Directing]] in 1989, the Department of [[Dramaturgy]] in 1994 and the Department of [[Theatrical producer|Production]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.unsa.ba/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D105%26Itemid%3D160%26lang%3Dhr |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723210830/http://www.asu.unsa.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=105&amp;Itemid=160&amp;lang=hr |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important segment of the academy's practice is its cooperation with the Open Stage "Obala", a prominent Sarajevo theater, where students present their works along with professional actors, directors and writers.

The need for the [[Academy for Performing Arts]] arose because, according to data from the year 1981, Bosnia and Herzegovina theaters had around 180 employees of which only 24 had the appropriate academic qualifications. Therefore, it was decided to establish Academy for Performing Arts in Sarajevo which was open to students from Bosnia and Herzegovina and other republics of [[former Yugoslavia]]. Academy of Performing Arts officially started working on December 2, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120729112449/http://www.asu.unsa.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=61&amp;lang=hr/ ''Academy of Performing Arts in Sarajevo''(in Bosnian) &amp;#91;cited February 21, 2012&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, it was announced that the [[Sarajevo Canton]] and the Cantonal Development Institute would be funding the construction of a 10 million [[Convertible Mark|KM]] building and center for the Academy of Performing Arts, primarily because working conditions for students and faculty alike have been subpar for the past decade. Construction on the new {{convert|4600|m²|0|abbr=on}} center began in mid-2010 in the [[Centar Municipality, Sarajevo|Centar Municipality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sa-c.net/index.php/projects/projects-archive/item/419-akademija-scenskih-umjetnosti-sarajevo.html |title=Renovacija Akademije scenskih umjetnosti (Renovation of the Academy of Performing Arts) |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Sarajevo Construction News |accessdate=15 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529093453/http://sa-c.net/index.php/projects/projects-archive/item/419-akademija-scenskih-umjetnosti-sarajevo.html |archivedate=29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''biscione''''' ({{IPA-it|biʃˈʃoːne}}; [[Milanese]]: ''bissa'' {{IPA-lmo|ˈbisa|}}, plural: "biscioni"), also known as "the '''''vipera'''''" ({{IPA-it|ˈviːpera|}}; "[[Viperidae|viper]]"),  is a [[heraldic]] [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] showing on [[argent]] an [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]] serpent in the act of consuming a human; usually a child and sometimes described as a [[Moors|Moor]] or an [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman Turk]]. It was the emblem of the  [[Visconti of Milan]] from the 11th century, becoming associated with [[Milan]] as the Visconti gained control over the city in 1277. When the Visconti family died out in the 15th century, the emblem retained its association with the [[Duchy of Milan]] and became part of the coats of arms of the [[House of Sforza]]; the presence of ''biscione'' in Poland ([[Sanok]])  and Belarus ([[Pruzhany]]) is due to queen [[Bona Sforza]].

The word "biscione" is a masculine [[:wikt:-one#Italian|augmentative]] of Italian feminine "biscia", "non-venomous snake"; "[[grass snake]]" (corrupted from "bistia", ultimately from Latin "bestia").
&lt;!-- do not dump random speculation without proper references, please.
Its iconographic origins date back to [[Early christian art and architecture|paleochristian]] times, to the biblical story of [[Jonah]] and the [[Leviathan]] in the act of swallowing (and/or regurgitating) him, a common  motif representing the [[resurrection]].{{cn}} It has been claimed that it was taken from the coat of arms of a [[Saracen]] killed by Ottone Visconti during the [[Crusades]]"){{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. Additionally, a man being swallowed by a serpent but being rescued features in a number of [[legends about Theoderic the Great]], most prominently in the poem ''Virginal'', where the city of [[Arona (NO)|Arona]], which was owned by the Visconti, is featured.{{cn}} The figure may also represent the circumpolar constellation [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]], from whose "mouth" emerges the brilliant star [[Vega]], in constellation Lyra (symbolized as a falling vulture in Arabian astronomy; Lyra is near Cygnus, which is the "Chicken" in Arabian astronomy; Jonah may be related to both, because it means "Dove"),{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} or also a symbol of the "coiling" path of the Moon towards the eclipse points.
--&gt;
As the symbol of Milan, the biscione is also used by the football club [[Inter Milan]], by car manufacturer [[Alfa Romeo]] (also known as the "''Casa del biscione''", Italian for "House of the biscione" or "Biscione['s] marque") and, in a version where a flower replaces the child (maybe due to possible interpretations as a [[Racism|racist]] symbol), by [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s companies [[Mediaset]] and [[Fininvest]] and his residential zones [[Milano Due]] and Milano Tre (a stylized biscione made from the number "[[5]]" is also the symbol of Berlusconi's [[Canale 5]]). A similar design is found in the seals of the Hungarian nobleman [[Nicholas I Garay]], [[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|palatine]] to the King of Hungary (1375–1385). Here the crowned snake devours a [[Sovereign's Orb]], rather than a human.&lt;ref&gt;ERESS D. CSABA: Ugod. Száz magyar falu könyvesháza. Szerkesztette: HERMANN ISTVÁN, Megjelent a magyar állam millenniumára, Budapest. Elektronikus megjelenítés: NKÖEOK Szerkesztőség – 2007 [https://hu.wikibooks.org/wiki/F%C3%A1jl:Garai_Mikl%C3%B3s.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparable to the biscione are some depictions of the Hindu deity [[Matsya]]. While his form is referred to as anthropomorphically having a humanoid upper half, and his lower half as that of a fish', some depictions show him with his upper body emerging from the mouth of a fish.  In Early Christian Art of the [[catacombs]], the [[Old Testament]] prophet [[Jonah]] is depicted as a man being swallowed (or regurgitated) by a serpent-like [[Leviathan]], a sea creature of Hebrew myth.

{{main article|Bohemianism}}
In modern use, the term "[[Bohemianism|Bohemian]]" is applied to people who live unconventional, usually artistic, lives. The adherents of the "[[Bloomsbury Group]]", which formed around the Stephen sisters, [[Vanessa Bell]] and [[Virginia Woolf]] in the early 20th century, are among the best-known examples. The original "Bohemians" were travellers or refugees from central Europe (hence, the French ''bohémien'', for "[[gypsy]]").

Reflecting on the fashion style of "[[boho-chic]]" in the early years of the 21st century, the ''Sunday Times'' thought it ironic that "fashionable girls wore ruffly floral skirts in the hope of looking bohemian, nomadic, spirited and non-[[bourgeois]]", whereas "gypsy girls themselves ... are sexy and delightful precisely because they do not give a hoot for fashion".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 19 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in the late 19th century and first half of the 20th, aspects of Bohemian fashion reflected the lifestyle itself.

== Early 19th century and the role of women ==
The bohemian sub-culture has been closely connected with predominantly male artists and intellectuals. The female counterparts have been closely connected with the so called [[Grisette (person)|Grisettes]],young women who combined part-time prostitution with various other  occupations. In the first quarter of the 19th century, the term Grisette also came to refer more specifically to the independent young women. These, often working as seamstresses or milliner's assistants as well frequented [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] artistic and cultural venues in Paris. Many grisettes worked as artist's models, often providing sexual favours to the artists in addition to posing for them. During the time of [[Louis-Philippe of France|King Louis-Philippe]] they came to dominate the bohemian modelling scene.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Lathers, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18580116.html 'The social construction and deconstruction of the female model in 19th-century France'], ''Mosaic'',  June, 1996. Retrieved via subscription 9 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Art is the grand excuse for all actions that are beyond vulgar. It is art that purifies everything, even a poor young woman's submission of her body."&lt;ref&gt;"C'est que l'art est la grande excuse à toutes les actions au délà du vulgaire; c'est que l'art purifie tout, même cet abandon qu'une pauvre fille fait de son corps." in Jules Janin, "La grisette" in ''Les Français peints par eux-mêmes: Encyclopédie morale du dix-neuvième siècle'', Paris, 1839-1842. Quoted in Dana Goldstein, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The grisette became a frequent character in French fiction but have been mentioned as early as in 1730 by [[Jonathan Swift]]. The term, compare [[Grisette (French)#The grisette in poetry|The grisette in poetry]], signifies qualities of both flirtatiousness and intellectual aspiration, [[George du Maurier]] based large parts of ''[[Trilby (novel)|Trilby]]'' on his experiences as a student in Parisian bohemia during the 1850s. Poe's 1842 story was based on the unsolved murder of [[Mary Rogers|Mary Cecilia Rogers]] near New York City, subtitled "A Sequel to '[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'", it was the first detective story to attempt the solution of a real crime.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Allan Poe, ''Tales of Mystery and Imagination'', (Introduction and notes by John S. Wiley), Wordsworth Editions, 1993, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The most enduring grisette is Mimi in [[Henri Murger]]’s  novel (and subsequent play) ''[[Scènes de la vie de Bohème]]'', the source for [[Puccini]]'s famous opera ''[[La bohème]].''

=== Pre-Raphaelites ===
[[File:Proserpine-(utdrag).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Jane Morris]] painted by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] as ''[[Proserpine (Rossetti painting)|Proserpine]]'' (1874)]]
In 1848 [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] used the word ''bohemianism'' in his novel ''Vanity Fair''. In 1862, the ''Westminster Review'' described a Bohemian as "simply an artist or ''littérateur'' who, consciously or unconsciously, secedes from conventionality in life and in art". During the 1860s the term was associated in particular with the [[pre-Raphaelite]] movement, the group of artists and aesthetes of which [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] was the most prominent:&lt;ref&gt;The original Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood had been formed in 1848 by [[William Holman Hunt]], Rossetti and [[John Everett Millais]], who aspired to a style of painting that they felt had been lost since the time of [[Raphael]] (1483–1520).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the 1860s progressed, Rossetti would become the grand prince of bohemianism as his deviations from normal standards became more audacious. And as he became this epitome of the unconventional, his egocentric demands necessarily required his close friends to remodel their own lives around him. His bohemianism was like a web in which others became trapped – none more so than [[William Morris|William]] and [[Jane Morris]].&lt;ref&gt;Franny Moyle (2009) ''Desperate Romantics''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Jane Morris, Edward Burne-Jones and pre-Raphaelite traits===
[[Jane Morris]], who was to become Rossetti's muse, epitomised, probably more than any of the women associated with the pre-Raphaelites, an unrestricted, flowing style of dress that, while unconventional at the time, would be highly influential at certain periods during the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Virginia Nicholson (2002) ''Among The Bohemians''&lt;/ref&gt; She and others, including the much less outlandish [[Georgiana Burne-Jones]] (wife of [[Edward Burne-Jones]],&lt;ref&gt;Though more conventional in many ways than Jane Morris, Georgie Burne-Jones was becoming "a bit of a bohemian" even in the early days of her marriage; for example, she would ask her maid to model for sketches in mid-morning, whereas a typical bourgeois wife would have given priority to the housework: Fiona MacCarthy (2011) ''The Last Pre-Raphaelite''.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the later pre-Raphaelites), eschewed the [[corsets]] and [[crinoline]]s of the mid-to-late Victorian era,&lt;ref&gt;Judith Flanders (2001) ''A Circle of Sisters''&lt;/ref&gt; a feature that impressed the American writer [[Henry James]] when he wrote to his sister in 1869 of the bohemian atmosphere of the Morrises’ house in the [[Bloomsbury]] district of London and, in particular, the "dark silent medieval" presence of its chateleine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s hard to say whether she’s a grand synthesis of all the pre-Raphaelite pictures ever made … whether she’s an original or a copy. In either case she’s a wonder. Imagine a tall lean woman in  a long dress of some dead purple stuff, guiltless of [[hoop skirts|hoops]] (or of anything else I should say) with a mass of crisp black hair heaped into great wavy projections on each of her temples … a long neck, without any collar, and ''in lieu'' thereof some dozen strings of outlandish beads.&lt;ref&gt;Henry James, letter to Alice James, 10 March 1869&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Euphemia ('Effie') Chalmers (née Gray), Lady Millais by Thomas Richmond.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[Effie Gray]] by [[Thomas Richmond]]]]
In his play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' (1912) [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] unmistakably based the part of Mrs. Higgins on the then elderly Jane Morris. Describing Mrs. Higgins' drawing room, he referred to a portrait of her "when she defied the fashion of her youth in one of the beautiful Rossettian costumes which, when caricatured by people who did not understand, led to the absurdities of popular estheticism ''[sic]'' in the eighteen-seventies".&lt;ref&gt;''Pygmalion'', introduction to Act III&lt;/ref&gt;

A biographer of Edward Burne-Jones, writing a century after Shaw (Fiona MacCarthy, 2011), has noted that, in 1964, when the influential [[Biba]] store was opened in [[Swinging London|London]] by [[Barbara Hulanicki]], the "long drooping structureless clothes", though sexier than the dresses portrayed in such Burne-Jones paintings as ''The Golden Stairs'' or ''The Sirens'', nevertheless resembled them.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona MacCarthy (2011) ''The Last Pre-Raphaelite''&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of Biba has been described by the biographer of British 20th century designer [[Laura Ashley]] as having an atmosphere that "reeked of sex ... [It] was designed to look like a [[bordello]] with its scarlet, black and gold plush fitments, but, interestingly, it implied an old-fashioned, [[Edwardian]] style of forbidden sex with its [[feather boas]], potted palms, [[bentwood]] coat racks and dark lighting"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1990"&gt;Anne Sebba (1990) ''Laura Ashley: a Life By Design''&lt;/ref&gt; MacCarthy observed also that "the androgynous appearance of Burne-Jones's male figures reflected the sexually ambivalent feeling" of the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;MacCarthy, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early flower power: Effie Millais===
[[Effie Gray]], whose marriage to [[John Ruskin]] was [[annulled]] in 1854 prior to her marrying the pre-Raphaelite painter [[John Millais]], is known to have used flowers as an adornment and probably also as an assertive "statement". While in Scotland with Ruskin (still her husband) and Millais, she gathered [[foxglove]]s to place in her hair. She wore them at breakfast despite being asked by her husband not to do so, a gesture of defiance, at a time of growing crisis in their relationship, that came to the critical notice of [[Florence Nightingale]]&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Fagence Cooper (2010) ''The Model Wife: The Passionate Lives of Effie Gray, Ruskin and Millais''. Florence Nightingale's observations regarding the foxgloves are noted in correspondence of her friend, the novelist [[Elizabeth Gaskell]], whose acquaintance with Effie Ruskin dated back to their schooldays. However, it is unclear when Nightingale herself met Effie: Cooper, ''op.cit'', footnote 85. (Gaskell was especially well connected. In 1861, for example, she was part of a house party at [[Fryston village|Fryston]] Hall, [[Yorkshire]] given by [[Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton|Richard Monckton Milnes]] – a persistent suitor of Florence Nightingale – that included also the MP [[William Edward Forster|William Forster]], [[Austen Layard]], who excavated the biblical city of [[Ninevah]], and the American (Union) Minister in London, [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]]. Gaskell was among a group visiting nearby [[Pomfret Castle]] when Adam received news of the [[Trent incident|''Trent'' incident]] that, in the early stages of the [[American Civil War]] almost brought Britain and the Union to war: see Amanda Foreman (2010)  ''A World on Fire''.)&lt;/ref&gt; (who tended to regard others of her sex with "scarcely concealed scorn" and was generally unsympathetic to "women's rights"&lt;ref&gt;David Cannadine (1998) ''History in Our Time''&lt;/ref&gt;). A few weeks earlier, on [[Midsummer Day]], Effie (possibly inspired by [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'') was said by her hostess, [[Pauline, Lady Trevelyan|Pauline Trevelyan]], to have "looked lovely" with [[stephanotis]] in her hair at an evening party in [[Northumberland]],&lt;ref&gt;Diary of Pauline, Lady Trevelyan, 24 June 1853, quoted in Robert Brownwell (2013) ''Marriage of Inconvenience''&lt;/ref&gt; while, the previous year, a male friend had brought glass flowers for her hair from [[Venice]].&lt;ref name="Brownwell, op.cit."&gt;Brownwell, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin's father was evidently shocked to learn that, when Effie herself was in Venice, she had removed her bonnet in public, ostensibly because of the heat.&lt;ref name="Brownwell, op.cit."/&gt;

In 1853 Millais painted ''Effie with Foxgloves in her Hair'' which depicts her wearing the flowers while doing needlework. Other paintings of the mid-to-late 19th century, such as [[Frederick Sandys]]' ''Love's Shadow'' (1867) of a girl with a rose in her hair, sucking a sprig of blossom, which was described in 1970 as "a first rate [[public relations|PR]] job for the Flower People",&lt;ref&gt;Robert Melville in ''New Statesman'', 20 November 1970&lt;/ref&gt; and Burne-Jones' ''The Heart of the Rose'' (1889),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/bj/paintings/18.html See MacCarthy, ''op.cit.'';]&lt;/ref&gt; have been cited as foreshadowing the "[[flower power]]" of the mid-to-late 1960s.

==Early 20th century and inter-war years==

===Rational dress and the women's movement===
[[File:Fanny_Gräfin_zu_Reventlow.jpg|thumb|[[Fanny zu Reventlow|Franziska Countess zu Reventlow]], undated photo, the "Bohemian Countess" of [[Schwabing]]]]
By the turn of the 20th century, an increasing number of professional women, notably in [[United States|America]], were attempting to live outside the traditional parameters of society. Between 1870 and 1910 the marriage rate among educated women in the United States fell to 60% (30% lower than the national average), while, by 1893, in the state of [[Massachusetts]] alone, some 300,000 women were earning their own living in nearly 300 occupations. The invention of the [[typewriter]] in 1867 was a particular spur: for example, by the turn of the 20th century, 80% of [[stenographers]] were women.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Mills in ''Sunday Times Culture'', 19 July 2015 (reviewing Kate Bolick, ''Spinster'')&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, such movements as the [[Rational Dress Society]] (1881), with which the Morrises and Georgiana Burne-Jones were involved, were beginning to exercise some influence on women's dress, although the pre-Raphaelite look was still considered "advanced" in the late years of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Nicholson (2002) ''Among The Bohemians''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Queen Victoria]]'s precocious daughter [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]], an accomplished painter and artist who mixed in bohemian circles, was sympathetic to rational dress and to the developing women's movement generally (although her rumoured pregnancy at the age of 18 was said to have been disguised by tight corsetry).&lt;ref&gt;John Sutherland in ''The Times'', 21 December 2013, reviewing Lucinda Hawksley, ''Princess Louise: Queen Victoria's Rebellious Daughter''&lt;/ref&gt;
However, it was not really until the [[First World War]] that "many working women ... embarked on a revolution in fashion that greatly reduced the weight and restrictions imposed on them by their clothing".&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] (2008) ''We Danced All Night''&lt;/ref&gt; Some women working in factories wore trousers and the [[brassiere]] (invented in 1889 by the [[feminist movement|feminist]] [[Herminie Cadolle]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Luxx'', 26 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and patented in America by [[Mary Phelps Jacob]] in 1914) began gradually to supersede the corset.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Marr (2009) ''The Making of Modern Britain''.&lt;/ref&gt; In shipyards "[[trouser suit]]s" (the term, "pantsuit" was adopted in America in the 1920s) were virtually essential to enable women to shin up and down ladders.&lt;ref&gt;Henrietta Heald, 'For England's Sake', ''History Today'', October 2014, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Music hall]] artists also helped to push the boundaries of fashion; these included [[Vesta Tilley]], whose daring adoption on stage of well tailored male dress not only had an influence on men's attire, but also foreshadowed to an extent styles adopted by some women in the inter-war period. It was widely understood that Tilley sought additional authenticity by wearing male underclothing, although off stage she was much more conventional in both her dress and general outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Adie (2013) ''Fighting on the Home Front: The Legacy of Women in World War One''. Tilley was actively involved in recruitment for war service and was happily married to her songwriter, [[Walter de Frece]], who was later knighted and became a Member of Parliament.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1920s, what had been a wartime expedient – the need to economise on material – had become a statement of freedom by young women, manifested by shorter hemlines (just above the knee by 1925–6&lt;ref name="Pugh, op. cit."&gt;[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] (2008) ''We Danced All Night''&lt;/ref&gt;) and boyish hairstyles, accompanied by what [[Robert Graves]] and [[Alan Hodge]] described as "the new fantastic development of [[Jazz]] music".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Graves &amp; Alan Hodge (1940) ''The Long Weekend: A Social History of Great Britain 1918–1939''&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1920 Olympics|Antwerp Olympic Games]] in 1920 the French [[lawn tennis|tennis]] player [[Suzanne Lenglen]] attracted attention with a knee length skirt that revealed her [[suspender belt]] whenever she leapt to smash a ball. From then on, sportwear for women, as with day-to-day clothes, became freer,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Fawcett in ''Royal Academy of Arts Magazine'', June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; although, after the [[Second World War]], when the American player [[Gussie Moran]] appeared at the [[Wimbledon championships]] of 1949 in a short skirt that revealed lace-trimmed [[panties]], the [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club]] accused her of bringing "vulgarity and sin into tennis" and shunned the outfit's designer [[Ted Tinling|Teddy Tinling]] for many years.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'' obituary of Gussie Moran, 19 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====The impact of lingerie in the 1920s and 30s====
The ''Penguin Social History of Britain'' noted that "by the 1920s newspapers were filled with advertisements for 'lingerie' and 'undies' which would have been classed as indecent a generation earlier".&lt;ref name="John Stevenson 1984"&gt;John Stevenson (1984) ''British Society 1914–45''&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in [[Ben Travers]]' comic novel ''[[Rookery Nook (novel)|Rookery Nook]]'' (1923), a young woman evicted from home in her nightwear and requiring day clothes remarked, "[[Union suit|Combies]]. That's all right. But in the summer you know, we don't ...",&lt;ref&gt;Rhoda Marley to Clive FitzWatters and Harold Twine in Travers, ''Rookery Nook'', chapter XII. Offering to assist her, Clive had suggested to Twine that "it will be more or less guess-work on my part – in the bag put one pair of thin com – er – lady's summer underwear". Rhoda asked if Twine "could just manage a pair of [[camiknickers|cami-knickers]] and a Princess [[petticoat]]". As early as 1920, in Travers' [[debut novel|début novel]] ''The Dippers'', Pauline Dipper's "black silk petticoat [did not] extend unduly, and it was possible to esteem the shapely outline of calf and instep, compressed in stockings of the same material" (chapter III). Also in ''The Dippers'', a young woman tried to start a conversation about "hygienic underclothing for ladies" with a man she mistakenly believed to have written articles on the subject: "I wanted to speak to you about something delicate ... this is not a subject one can discuss in public. People have such conventional ideas" (Helen Monk to Henry Talboyes, chapter VIII).&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[Agatha Christie]]'s thriller, ''[[The Seven Dials Mystery]]'' (1929), the aristocratic heroine, [[Bundle Brent|Lady "Bundle" Brent]], wore only "a negligible trifle" under her dress; like many real life "[[it girl]]s" of her class, she had been freed from the "genteel expectations" of earlier generations.&lt;ref&gt;''Glamour's Golden Age'', BBC4, 26 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] the actress [[Carole Lombard]], who, in the 1930s, combined feistiness with sexual allure, never wore a brassière and "avoided panties".&lt;ref&gt;Jane Ellen Wayne (1993) ''Clark Gable: Portrait of a Misfit''&lt;/ref&gt; However, she famously declared that though "I live by a man's code designed to fit a man's world ... at the same time I never forget that a woman's first job is to choose the right shade of lipstick"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Halliwell's Filmgoer's Companion'' (10th ed. 1993) edited by John Walker. Almost 70 years after Lombard's death, the ''Sunday Times'' described red lipstick as the "''ne plus ultra'' [not further beyond] of make up ... We respect red lipstick as a badge of loveliness and youth ([[Georgia May Foote|Georgia May]]), bold style ([[Florence Welch]]), sexual confidence ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) and old-school glamour ([[Rosie Huntington-Whiteley]]) – and, above all, we appreciate that it doesn't work for everyone": Shane Watson in ''Style'', 4 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, sales of men's [[undershirts]] fell dramatically in the United States when Lombard's future husband, [[Clark Gable]], was revealed not to be wearing one in a famous motel bedroom scene with [[Claudette Colbert]] in the film ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934). According to Gable, "the idea was looking half-naked and scaring the brat into her own bed on the other side of the blanket [hanging from a clothesline to separate twin beds]". However, he "gave the impression that going without was a vital sign of a man's virility"&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the adoption by the American movie industry of the [[Hays code|Hays Production Code]] in the early 1930s had a significant effect on how moral, and especially sexual, issues were depicted on film. This included a more conservative approach to matters of dress. Whereas the sort of scanty lingerie on show in some earlier productions (for example, [[Joan Blondell]] and [[Barbara Stanwyck]] in ''[[Night Nurse (1931 film)|Night Nurse]]'', 1931)&lt;ref&gt;Tim Stanley, 'Speaking in Code', ''History Today'', October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; had tended to reflect trends that, in the 1920s, defied convention and were regarded many young women as liberating, by the early years of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] such displays came to be regarded quite widely as undesirable. Developments in the late 1960s and 70s, when the strictures of the code were abandoned, followed a similar pattern, although, by then, it was often women themselves who were in the vanguard of resistance to sexualised imagery.

Looking back at this period, Graves and Hodge noted the protracted course that "daring female fashions had always taken ... from brothel to stage, then on to Bohemia, to Society, to Society's maids, to the mill-girl and lastly to the suburban woman".&lt;ref&gt;Graves &amp; Hodge, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Dorelia" look===
Among female Bohemians in the early 20th century, the "gypsy look" was a recurring theme, popularised by, among others, [[Dorelia McNeill|Dorothy "Dorelia" McNeill]] (1881–1969), [[muse]], lover and second wife of the painter [[Augustus John]] (1878–1961), whose full skirts and bright colours gave rise to the so-called "Dorelia look".&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Nicholson (2002) ''Among the Bohemians''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Katherine Everett]], ''née'' Olive, a former student of the [[Slade School of Art]] in London, has described McNeil's "tight fitting, hand-sewn, canary coloured bodice above a dark gathered flowing skirt, and her hair very black and gleaming, emphasiz[ing] the long silver earrings which were her only adornment".&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Everett (1949) ''Bricks and Flowers''. See also Juliet Nicholson (2006) ''The Perfect Summer''&lt;/ref&gt;

Everett recalled also the Johns' woods "with wild cherry trees in blossom, and ... a model with flying red hair, clad in white, being chased in and out of the trees by nude children".&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Everett (1949) ''Bricks and Flowers''&lt;/ref&gt; With similar lack of inhibition, as early as 1907 the American heiress [[Natalie Barney]] (1875–1972) was leading like-minded women in [[Lesbianism|sapphic]] dances in her Parisian garden,&lt;ref&gt;See Diana Souhami (2004) ''Wild Girls''&lt;/ref&gt; photographs of which look little different from scenes at [[Woodstock]] in 1969 and other "pop" festivals of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

===Bobbed hair and cross-gender styles===

By contrast, short [[bob cut|bobbed hair]] was often a Bohemian trait,&lt;ref name="John Stevenson 1984"/&gt; having originated in Paris ''c.''1909 and been adopted by students at the Slade&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Cannan (1916) ''Mendel''&lt;/ref&gt; several years before American film actresses such as [[Colleen Moore]] and [[Louise Brooks]] ("the girl in the black helmet") became associated with it in the mid-1920s. This style was plainly discernible on a woodblock self-portrait of 1916 by [[Dora Carrington]], who had entered the Slade in 1910,&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Gerzine (1989) ''Carrington''&lt;/ref&gt; and, indeed, the journalist and historian Sir [[Max Hastings]] has referred to "poling [[Punt (boat)|punts]] occupied by reclining girls with bobbed hair" as an enduring, if misleading, popular image of the "idyll before the storm" of the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;Max Hastings (2013) ''Catastrophe: Europe Goes to War 1914''. Hastings himself rejected the notion that the years immediately before the war represented some sort of golden age.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s short story, ''[[Bernice Bobs Her Hair]]'' (1920), a young woman who wishes to become a "society [[vampire|vamp]]" regards the adoption of a bob as a necessary prelude,&lt;ref&gt;See Ellie Pithers in ''Telegraph Magazine'', 26 January 2013. The term, "vamp" (after "vampire"), was associated in particular with the silent film actress [[Theda Bara]] (1885–1955).&lt;/ref&gt; while Louise Brooks' sexually charged performance as [[Earth Spirit (play)|Lulu]] in [[G. W. Pabst]]'s film, ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' (1929), left an enduring image of the style, which has been replicated on screen over the years, most vividly by [[Cyd Charisse]] in ''[[Singin' in the Rain (film)|Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952), [[Isabelle de Funès]] as [[Valentina (comic book)|Valentina]] in ''[[Baba Yaga (film)|Baba Yaga]]'' (1973)&lt;ref&gt;Valentina was originally a comic book creation by Italian artist [[Guido Crepax]], inspired by Louise Brooks in ''Pandora's Box'': see Roland Jaccard (ed. 1986) ''Louise Brooks: Portrait of an Anti-Star''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Melanie Griffith]] in ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]'' (1986). It was associated also with many popular singers and actresses in the 1960s and has frequently been evoked by writers and directors, as well as fashion designers, seeking to recapture the [[hedonism|hedonsitic]] or free spirit of the 1920s. For example, [[Kerry Greenwood]]'s ''[[Cocaine Blues (novel)|Cocaine Blues]]'' (1989) and succeeding novels about [[Phryne Fisher]], a glamorous, but unconventional aristocratic investigator in late twenties [[Melbourne]], Australia, conveyed an image – "five feet two [157.5 centimetres] with eyes of green and black hair cut into a cap"&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood (2012) ''Unnatural Habits''&lt;/ref&gt; – that was later cultivated stylishly on television by [[Essie Davis]] in [[ABC1|ABC]]'s ''[[Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;[[Tasmania]]n-born Davis was in her early 40s when she played Phryne Fisher, though the heroine of the books was only as old as the century (28 in 1928). Other recent examples of the 1920s style bob have included [[Gemma Arterton]] in ''[[St Trinian's (2007 film)|St. Trinian's]]'' (2007) and [[Michelle Dockery]] as Lady Mary Crawley in the 5th series of ITV's ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' (2014), the latter set in 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1926 an even shorter style, known as the "[[Eton crop]]", became popular:&lt;ref name="Pugh, op. cit."/&gt; on her arrival in [[Tilling (Sussex)|Tilling]] (Rye) in [[Edward Frederic Benson|E F Benson]]'s comic novel ''[[Mapp and Lucia]]'' (1931), Lucia described "Quaint" Irene as "a girl with no hat and an Eton crop. She was dressed in a fisherman's [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] and knickerbockers". (In the same book, Miss Mapp frequently – and topically – addressed Lucia, to her irritation, as "Lulu".) For many years trite assumptions were often made about the sexuality of women with cropped hairstyles; an historian of the 1980s wrote of the [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp|Greenham Common]] "peace camp" in England that it "brought public awareness to [[feminist]] separation and even to lesbianism, hitherto seen in the mass media – when acknowledged at all – either in terms of Eton-cropped [[androgyny]] or of pornographic fantasy".&lt;ref&gt;Alwyn W. Turner (2010) ''Rejoice! Rejoice!: Britain in the 1980s''&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, others have drawn a stark contrast between the bohemian demeanour of the Greenham women and the "bold make-up and [[power dressing|power-dressing]]" that tended to define women's fashion more generally in the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;Graham Stewart (2013) ''Bang! A History of Britain in the 1980s''&lt;/ref&gt; (the so-called "designer decade").

One social historian has observed that "the innocuous woollen jersey, now known [in Britain] as the [[Sweater|jumper]] or the pullover, was the first item of clothing to become interchangeable between men and women and, as such, was seen as a dangerous symptom of gender confusion".&lt;ref name="Pugh, op. cit."/&gt; Trousers for women, sometimes worn mannishly as an expression of sexuality (as by [[Marlene Dietrich]] as a  cabaret singer in the 1930 film, ''[[Morocco (1930 film)|Morocco]]'', in which she dressed in a white tie suit and kissed a girl in the audience&lt;ref&gt;Tim Stanley, 'Speaking in Code' in ''History Today'', October 2014 at page 21. Dietrich made clear her personal preference for such clothes: "I do not wear them to be sensational. I think I am much more alluring ..." (quoted, ''ibid.'').&lt;/ref&gt;) also became popular in the 1920s and 1930s, as did aspects of what many years later would sometimes be referred to as "[[shabby chic]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shabby Chic Accessory Ideas|url=https://www.justlovelyproducts.com/blog-article/shabby-chic-accessory-ideas-for-your-home-11/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winston Churchill]]'s niece [[Clarissa Eden|Clarissa]] was among those who wore a tailored suit in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Clarissa Eden (2007) ''A Memoir: From Churchill to Eden''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "New Look"===
After the [[Second World War]] [[Christian Dior]]'s "[[Christian Dior S.A.#The "New Look"|New Look]]", launched in Paris in 1947, though drawing on styles that had begun to emerge in 1938-9,&lt;ref&gt;Pearson Phillips in ''Age of Austerity 1945–1951'' (ed. Michael Sissons &amp; Philip French, 1963)
&lt;/ref&gt; set the pattern for women's fashion generally until the 1960s. Harking back in some ways to the ''[[Belle Epoque]]'' of the late 19th and early 20th centuries – and thus not a "new" look as such (by early 1948, it was simply known as "The Look" in America&lt;ref&gt;Norah Alexander in ''Daily Mail'', 13 March 1948. In a cartoon of 1949 [[David Langdon]] had a ''vendeuse'' saying to a customer, "By 'New Look' I take it you mean what we now consider 'Old Look', but not the 'Old Look' which preceded the 'New Look': ''Punch'', 30 March 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;) – it was criticised by some as excessively feminine and, with its accompanying corsets and rustle of frilled [[petticoat]]s, as setting back the "work of emancipation won through participation in two world wars".&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, ''loc.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; It also, for a while, bucked the trend towards boyish fashion that, as after the [[First World War]], tended to follow major conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;With reference to the colourless "utility" garments that became commonplace in Britain during the war, Phillips ''(loc.cit.)'' quotes an expert of the time at London's [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] as asserting that "men will feel oppressed and frightened by excessive [[femininity]] when they return from war".&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Rive Gauche''===
American influences had been discouraged  during the [[Nazi occupation of France]], but, notably in the form of [[be-bop]] and other types of jazz, were strong among intellectual [[café society]] in the mid-to-late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;See Dan Halpern in ''The New Yorker'', 25 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, ''Samedi-Soir'' lifted the lid on what it called the "[[caveman|troglodytes]] of Saint-Germain",&lt;ref&gt;''Samedi-Soir'', 3 May 1947&lt;/ref&gt; namely bohemians of the Parisian [[Left Bank]] (''Rive Gauche'') district of [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés]], who appeared to cluster around [[existentialist]] philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. These included [[Roger Vadim]] (who married and launched the career of actress [[Brigitte Bardot]] in the 1950s), novelist [[Boris Vian]] (since described as "the epitome of Left Bank bohemia, standing at the center of its postwar rehabilitation"&lt;ref&gt;Dan Halpern, ''The New Yorker'', 25 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;) and singer [[Juliette Gréco]].
[[Image:Juliette Gréco (1963) by Erling Mandelmann - 3.jpg|thumb|right|Juliette Gréco in 1963]]

====Juliette Gréco====
At the [[liberation of Paris]] in 1944, the American journalist [[Ernie Pyle]] observed that the women were all "brightly dressed in white or red blouses and colourful peasant skirts, with flowers in their hair and big flashy earrings."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Nicholas Rankin (2011) ''Ian Fleming's Commandos: The Story of 30 Assault Unit in WWII''&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Lady Diana Cooper]], whose husband, [[Duff Cooper]], became British Ambassador to Paris that year, wrote that, during the occupation, Parisienne women had worn "grotesquely large hats hung with flowers and fruits and feathers and ribbons" as well as high carved wooden shoes.&lt;ref&gt;Letter, 23 September 1944: ''Darling Monster: The Letters of Lady Diana Cooper to her Son John Julius Norwich 1939-1952'' (ed John Julius Norwich, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in contrast to such striking bohemian adornments and subsequently the "New Look" (which itself scandalised some Parisennes), the clothes of the post-war bohemians were predominantly black: when Gréco first performed outside Saint-Germain she affronted some of her audience by wearing "black trousers, her bare feet slipped into golden sandals".&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony Beevor]] &amp; Artemis Cooper (1994) ''Paris After the Liberation''&lt;/ref&gt; In old age she claimed that this style of dress arose from [[poverty]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was a teenager in Paris ... I only had one dress and one pair of shoes, so the boys in the house started dressing me in their old black coats and trousers. A fashion was shaped out of misery. When people copied me I found it a little ridiculous, but I didn't mind. It made me smile.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Will Hodgkinson, ''Times Saturday Review'', 6 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Performing in London over fifty years later, Gréco was described as "still ooz[ing] bohemian style".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint-Germain in retrospect===
Capturing the spirit of the time, [[David Profumo]] has written of how his mother, the actress [[Valerie Hobson]], was entranced by Roger Vadim's flatmate, the director [[Marc Allégret]], while she was filming ''Blanche Fury'' in 1947:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Allégret's apparently bohemian lifestyle appealed sharply to her romantic side ... and she revelled in the Left Bank milieu to which he introduced her during script discussions in Paris. There were meals with [[André Gide]], [[Jean Cocteau]] and the long-legged [[Zizi Jeanmaire]]. For an attractive British woman who felt deprived of attention ... this was an ideal situation for some sort of reawakening.&lt;ref&gt;David Profumo (2006) ''Bringing the House Down''. In contrast to Vadim, who had not turned twenty, Allégret (1900–73) was in middle age when he directed Hobson. He had been married to the daughter of the editor of French ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', who left him after the war for a theatrical agent, André Bernham, taking their daughter with her ''(ibid).'' Jeanmaire is probably best remembered through the second line – "And you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire" – of [[Peter Sarstedt]]'s song "[[Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?]]" (1969) which captured the spirit of Parisian high life in the late 1960s.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The previous year a perfume created for Hobson had been marketed as "Great Expectations" to coincide with her role as [[Estella Havisham]] in [[David Lean]]'s [[Great Expectations (1946 film)|film]] of that name, based on [[Charles Dickens]]' 1861 novel. In England, this attracted the custom of  then-[[Oxford University]] undergraduate Margaret Roberts, later British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who, a little daringly for the time, also shopped for "push-up" pink brassieres.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Moore (2013) ''Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography – Volume One: Not for Turning''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, when Hobson starred in the musical ''[[The King and I]]'' in London, it was apparent that she had retained a Parisienne mix of ''[[chic (style)|chic]]'' and Boheminism. A ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' journalist described her "pale, ladylike looks, her well-bred clothes ... she likes embroidery and painting", while a young [[Eton School|Etonian]] who visited her dressing room recalled that "it had been freshly painted pink and white for her, and was like entering a risqué French apartment".&lt;ref&gt;Eve Champman and Hugo Williams quoted in [[David Kynaston]] (2009) ''Family Britain 1951–57''&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, when Hobson's husband, the politician [[John Profumo]], was involved in a [[Profumo Affair|sex scandal]] that threatened to destabilise the British government, Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] wrote that "his [Profumo's] wife is very nice and sensible. Of course, these people live in a raffish, theatrical, bohemian society where no one really knows anyone and everyone is "darling"".&lt;ref&gt;Harold Macmillan, diary, 22 March 1963, quoted in Alistair Horne (1989) ''Harold Macmillan 1957–1986''; Charles Williams (2009) ''Harold Macmillan''&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-war Paris was recalled fondly in 2007 when [[Smoking in France|France introduced a ban]] on [[smoking ban|smoking]] in public places. The aroma of [[Gauloises]] and [[Gitanes]] was, for many years, thought to be an inseparable feature of Parisian café society, but the owner of [[Les Deux Magots]], once frequented by Sartre, [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Albert Camus]] and other writers, observed that "things have changed. The writers of today are not so addicted to cigarettes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6319133.stm|title=BBC NEWS - World - Europe - Bidding goodbye to the Gauloises|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A British journalist who interviewed Juliette Gréco in 2010 described Les Deux Magots and the Café de Flore as "now overpriced tourist hotspots" and noted that "chain stores and expensive restaurants have replaced the bookshops, cafés and revolutionary ideas of Jean-Paul Sartre and [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s Rive Gauche".&lt;ref&gt;Will Hodgkinson, ''Times Saturday Review'', 6 November 2010. Simone de Beauvoir was an [[existentialist]] companion of Sartre. See Bruno Waterfield in ''The Times Saturday Review'', 25 July 2015, regarding the "sanitised" Europe of the early 21st century and its effect on French culture.&lt;/ref&gt; As measures of changing attitudes to [[cuisine]] and fashion, by the early 21st century 80% of French [[croissants]] were being made in food plants, while, by 2014, only one factory continued to manufacture the traditional male [[beret]] associated with printers, artists, political activists and, during the inter-war years, the tennis player [[Jean Borotra]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Waterfield in ''The Times Saturday Review'', 25 July 2015 (reviewing Jonathan Fenby (2015) ''The History of Modern France'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===New influences in 1960s===
The bohemian traits of post-war Paris spread to other urban parts of the French-speaking world, notably to [[Algiers]], where an underground culture of "jazz clubs, girls and drugs" grew up - in the words of [[punk rock]] producer [[Marc Zermati]], who was in the city at the height of the [[Algerian war]] in the late 1950s, "all very French".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hussey, ''History Today'', March 2015 at page 64 (reviewing Barnett Singer, ''The Americanization of France'').&lt;/ref&gt; However, that war marked a turning point which, in the view of some, was so traumatic that "ordinary French people" looked instead to America  as "a new model for pleasure and happiness".&lt;ref&gt;Hussey, ''loc.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, led to the ''[[ye-ye]]'' music of the early to mid 1960s (named after the British band, the [[Beatles]]' use of "yeah, yeah" in some their early songs&lt;ref&gt;Notably ''She Loves You'' ([[John Lennon]]/[[Paul McCartney]], 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;) and the rise of such singers as [[Johnny Halliday]] and [[Françoise Hardy]]. The French also adopted a number of British singers ([[Petula Clark]], [[Gillian Hills]], [[Jane Birkin]]) who performed successfully in French, Birkin forming a long-term relationship with singer/songwriter [[Serge Gainsbourg]], who was a seminal figure in French popular music in the 1960s and 70s. In 1968 major industrial and student unrest in Paris and other parts of France came close to ousting the government of President [[Charles de Gaulle]], who, after leading the [[Free French]] during the Second World War, had returned to power at the time of the Algerian emergency. The [[May 1968 events in France|events of 1968]] represented a further significant landmark in post-war France,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Seale &amp; Maureen McConville (1968) ''French Revolution 1968''&lt;/ref&gt; although their longer term impact was probably more on cultural, social and academic life than on the political system, which, through the constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] (1958), has remained broadly intact.&lt;ref&gt;At the time, Seale &amp; McConville ''(op.cit.)'' described de Gaulle's survival in 1968 as "an amazing demonstration of political virility in a man of 77". He resigned the following year and died in 1970. A later historian contrasted the stature of de Gaulle with "the [[soap opera]] lives" of Presidents [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]] (2007-12) and [[François Hollande|Hollande]] (2012-): Jonathan Fenby (2015) ''The History of Modern France: From Revolution to Present Day''&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, one paradox of 1968 was that the first student demonstrations broke out at [[Nanterre University|Nanterre]], whose catchment area included the affluent and "[[chic]]" 16th and 17th ''arrondissements'' of Paris. Its students were more modish and "trendy" than those of the [[Sorbonne]] in the city's [[Quartier Latin|Latin Quarter]], being described at the time in terms that typify more generally the styles and attitudes of young people the late 1960s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the girls that give the show away - [[culottes]], glossy leather, [[mini skirt|mini-skirts]], boots - driving up in [[Mini|Mini-Coopers]] ... Rebellious sentiment is more obvious among the boys: long hair, square spectacles, [[Che Guevara]] [Cuban revolutionary, died 1967] beards. The picture in Nanterre in May was lots and lots of painted dollies cohabiting with unkempt revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Seale &amp; McConville, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== America: the beat generation and flower power ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Summer of Love]] --&gt;

[[Image:Anna Sui Lumberjack Dress FW 2009.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Snejana Onopka]] on the runway for [[Anna Sui]] in November 2011.]]

In the United States adherents of the "[[Beat generation|beat]]" counter-culture (probably best defined by [[Jack Kerouac]]'s novel, ''[[On the Road]]'', set in the late 1940s, written in 1952 and published in 1957) were associated with black [[polo neck|polo-neck]] (or turtle neck) sweaters, blue denim jeans and sandals. The influence of this movement could be seen in the persona and songs of [[Bob Dylan]] in the early to mid-1960s, "road" films like ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) and the [[punk rock|punk]]-oriented "New Wave" of the mid-1970s, which, among other things, produced a boho style icon in [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]] of the New York band [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], whom photographer [[David LaChapelle]] has described as "the definition of [[Cool (aesthetic)|cool]]".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Lina Das in ''You'' magazine, ''Mail on Sunday'', 3 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; (However, as with some American musicians of the mid-1960s, such as [[Sonny and Cher]], Blondie came to international prominence only after a tour of Britain in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;When the British band the [[Rolling Stones]] arrived in Los Angeles in 1964 they were met by [[Sonny Bono]], who was then doing promotional work for producer [[Phil Spector]]. A year later, he and [[Cher]] were "feted" at the [[Dorchester Hotel]] in London and "presented to the world" by [[Ahmet Ertegun]]: see Keith Richards (2010) ''Life''.&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Greenwich Village and West Coast===
New York's [[Greenwich Village]], which, since the late 19th century, had attracted many women with [[feminism|feminist]] or "[[free love]]" ideals,&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Mills in ''Sunday Times Culture'', 19 July 2015 (reviewing Kate Bolick (2015) ''Spinster'')&lt;/ref&gt; was a particular magnet for bohemians in the early 1960s. Bob Dylan's girl-friend [[Suze Rotolo]], who appeared with him on the cover of his second album ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'' (1963), recalled that the Village was "where people like me went – people who didn't belong where they came from .. where the writers I was reading and the artists I was looking at had lived or passed through".&lt;ref&gt;Suze Rotolo (2009) ''A Freewheelin' Time''&lt;/ref&gt; These "beatniks" (as they came to be known by the late 1950s) were, in many ways, the antecedents of the hippie movement that formed on the West Coast of the USA in the mid-1960s&lt;ref&gt;Suze Rotolo observed that "the Beats had already cracked the façade [of constricted and rigid morality] and we, the next generation, broke through it": ''A Freewheelin' Time, op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; and came to the fore as the first post-war [[baby-boomers]] reached the age of majority in the "[[Summer of Love]]" of 1967. The [[Monterey Pop Festival]] was a major landmark of that year, which was associated with [[Flower power|"flowerpower"]], [[psychedelia]], opposition to the [[Vietnam war]] and the inventive music and flowing, colourful fashions of, among others, [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[the Mamas &amp; the Papas]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and the British group, [[The Beatles]], whose album, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', is said to have caused the guru of psychedelia, [[Timothy Leary]], to remark that "my work is finished".&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Yorker'', 26 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hippiedom and the Pre-Raphaelites===
The documentary film, ''[[Festival (1967 film)|Festival]]'' ([[Murray Lerner]], 1967), recorded how the "clean-cut college kids" who attended the [[Newport Folk Festival|Newport (Rhode Island) Folk Festival]] in 1963-4 had, by 1965 (when [[Electric Dylan controversy|Bob Dylan caused a sensation]] at that year's festival by playing an [[electric guitar]]), become "considerably scruffier": "the hippies were waiting to be born".&lt;ref&gt;Jason Anderson, "This Land is Your Land" in ''Uncut'', September 2015, at p.60&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the wearing of male neckties, which, in the mid-1960s, had often drawn on 19th century paisley patterns,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1990"/&gt; declined as [[sideburns|muttonchop]] whiskers and [[sunglasses|teashades]] (sunglasses) came in: by the time of the [[Chicago 7]] trial (late 1969), hair over the collars had become so commonplace that it was beginning to transcend Bohemian style, taking on mass popularity in the 1970s. The London art dealer [[Jeremy Maas]] reflected in the mid-1980s that

&lt;blockquote&gt;there [was] no question that the Hippy ''[sic]'' movement and its repercussive influence in England owed much of its imagery, its manner, dress and personal appearance to the Pre-Raphaelite ideal ... It was observed by all of us who were involved with these exhibitions [of pre-Raphaelite paintings] that visitors included increasing numbers of the younger generation, who had begun to resemble the figures in the pictures they had come to see.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Laurence Des Cars]] (2000) ''[[The Pre-Raphaelites: Romance and Realism]]'', ‘[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]’ series. See also Fiona MacCarthy (2011), ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jimmy Page]] of the British band [[Led Zeppelin]], who collected Pre-Raphaelite paintings, observed of Edward Burne-Jones that "the romance of the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] legends [captured in his paintings] and the bohemian life of the artists who were reworking these stories seemed very attuned to our time",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''History Today'', October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; while the author David Waller noted in 2011 that Burne-Jones' subjects "have much in common with the sixties rock chicks and their pop-star [[paladin]]s".&lt;ref&gt;''History Today'', ''loc.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== London in the 1950s ==

Although the annual ''[[The Saturday Book|Saturday Book]]'' recorded in 1956 a view that "London's now nothing but flash coffee bars, with teddies and little bits of girls in jeans",&lt;ref&gt;''Saturday Book'', vol 16, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; the "Edwardian" ("[[teddy boy]]") look of the times did not coincide with Bohemian tastes. For women, the legacy of the "New Look" was still apparent, although hemlines had generally risen as, as one journalist put it in 1963, "photographs of those first bold bearers of the New Look make them seem strangely lost and bewildered, as though they had mistaken their cue and come on stage fifty years late".&lt;ref&gt;Pearson Phillips in ''Age of Austerity'', ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; The Bohemian foci during this period were the jazz clubs and [[espresso]] bars of [[Soho]] and [[Fitzrovia]]. Their habitués usually wore polo necks; in the words of one social historian, “thousands of pale, [[Duffle Coat|duffel-coat]]-clad students were hunched in coffee bars over their copies of Jean-Paul Sartre and Jack Kerouac”.&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Sandbrook (2005) ''Never Had It So Good''&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[pub|public houses]] and clubs also catered for Bohemian tastes, notably the [[Colony Room Club]] in Soho, opened in 1948 by [[Muriel Belcher]], a lesbian from [[Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Parkin (2012) ''Colony Room Club 1948–2008: A History of Bohemian Soho''&lt;/ref&gt; As with the literary phenomenon of the so-called "[[Angry Young Men]]" from 1956 onwards, the image was more a male, than a female, one. However, when the singer [[Alma Cogan]] wished to mark her success by buying [[mink]] coats for her mother and sister, the actress Sandra Caron, the latter asked for a duffel-coat instead because she wanted to be regarded as a serious actress and "a sort of a beatnik".&lt;ref&gt;Carol Dyhouse in ''History Today'', November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960 the future author [[Jacqueline Wilson]], who, as a teenager, lived in [[Kingston-upon-Thames]], [[Surrey]], captured this look after spotting two acquaintances in a [[record shop]] "in [[turquoise]] duffle coats, extremely tight jeans and [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha]] shoes being cuddled by a group of horrible spotty teddy boys".&lt;ref&gt;Diary, 13 February 1960, quoted in David Kynaston (2014) ''Modernity Britain: A Shake of the Dice, 1959-62''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental influences===
In [[Iris Murdoch]]'s novel, ''The Bell'' (1958), an art student named Dora Greenfield bought "big multi-coloured skirts and jazz records and sandals". However, as Britain emerged from post-war [[austerity]], some Bohemian women found influences from continental Europe, adopting, for example, the "[[gamine]] look", with its black jerseys and short, almost boyish hairstyles associated with film actresses [[Audrey Hepburn]] (''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'', 1954, and as a "Gréco beatnik"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Times Saturday Review'', 6 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Funny Face]]'', 1957) and [[Jean Seberg]] (''[[Bonjour Tristesse]]'', 1957 and [[Breathless (1960 film)|''A bout de souffle'']], 1960), as well as the French novelist [[Françoise Sagan]], who, as one critic put it, "was celebrated for the variety of her partners and for driving fast sports cars in bare feet as an example of the free life".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Lewis (1978) ''The 50s''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 [[Fenella Fielding]] played "a mascara-clad Gréco-alike" in ''[[The Rebel (1961 film)|The Rebel]]'' with comedian [[Tony Hancock]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; while, more recently, [[Talulah Riley]] replicated the look for scenes in ITV's 2006 adaptation of Agatha Christie's ''[[The Moving Finger]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Part of the ''[[Agatha Christie's Marple|Marple]]'' series, with Riley as Megan Symington.&lt;/ref&gt; set in 1951.

Others favoured the lower-cut, tighter styles of continental stars such as Bardot or [[Gina Lollobrigida]]. Valerie Hobson was among those whose wardrobe drew on Italian ''couture''; in addition to a large collection of [[stiletto heel]]ed shoes, she possessed a skirt made from [[Python (genus)|python]] skin.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Davenport-Hines (2013) ''An English Affair''&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, European tastes – including the [[Lambretta (motorscooter)|Lambretta]] motor scooter and Italian and French cuisine, which the widely travelled cookery writer [[Elizabeth David]], herself a bit of a Bohemian, did much to promote&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''A Book of Mediterranean Food'' (1950)&lt;/ref&gt; – not only began to pervade Bohemian circles, but offered a contrast, from 1955 onwards, with the brasher Americanism of [[rock 'n' roll]], with its predominantly [[teenager|teenage]] associations.

== Hamburg and Beatlemania ==
[[Image:Don Adams Barbara Feldon Get Smart 1965.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Bobbed hair revival: [[Barbara Feldon]] with [[Don Adams]] in ''[[Get Smart]]'' (1965)]]
In 1960, when the Beatles (then an obscure [[Liverpudlian]] combo with five members, as opposed to their eventual "fab" four) were working in [[Hamburg]], West Germany, they were influenced by a Bohemian "art school" set known as [[Exi (subculture)|''Exis'']] (for "existentialists"). The ''Exis'' were roughly equivalent to what in France became known as ''les beats'' and included photographer [[Astrid Kirchherr]] (for whom the "[[fifth Beatle]]" [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] left the group) and artist and musician [[Klaus Voormann]] (who designed the cover for the Beatles' album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' in 1966).

[[John Lennon]]'s wife [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia]] recalled that Kirchherr was fascinated by the Beatles' "teddy-boy style", but that they, in turn, were "bowled over by her hip black clothes, her ''[[avant garde]]'' way of life, her photography and her sense of style".&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Lennon (2005) ''John''&lt;/ref&gt; As a result the group acquired black leather jackets, as well as fringed [[eponymous hairstyles|hairstyles]] that were the prototype of the "[[mop-top]]" cuts associated with "[[Beatlemania]]" in 1963-4.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Sandbrook, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; The latter coincided with the revival of the bobbed style for women, promoted in London by hairdresser [[Vidal Sassoon]],&lt;ref&gt;Bob Hope in ''Telegraph Magazine'', ''loc.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; initially for actress [[Nancy Kwan]], and adopted by, among others, singers [[Cilla Black]],&lt;ref&gt;And replicated by [[Sheridan Smith]] in the ITV [[biopic]], ''[[Cilla (TV series)|Cilla]]'' (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Billie Davis]] and, in America, [[Bev Bivens]] of [[We Five]] and [[Tammi Terrell]], fashion designers [[Mary Quant]] and [[Jean Muir]], American actress [[Barbara Feldon]] in the TV series ''[[Get Smart]]'', and, in the form of a longer bob, [[Cathy McGowan (presenter)|Cathy McGowan]], who presented the influential British TV pop music show, ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' (1963-6).&lt;ref&gt;A similar style to McGowan's was adopted in the early 2010s by British Labour Party politician [[Rachel Reeves]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, when longer blonde hair (associated with, among many others, [[Julie Christie]], [[Samantha Juste]], [[Judy Geeson]] and a fashion model named [[Lorna McDonald (model)|Lorna McDonald]], who, at the end of each edition of the BBC's ''Dee Time'', jumped into [[Simon Dee]]'s open [[E-type Jaguar]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wiseman (2006) ''Whatever Happened to Simon Dee?''&lt;/ref&gt;) came to typify the "sixties" look, advertisers turned to the Bohemian world for inspiration: through its use of herbs, [[Sunsilk]] [[shampoo]] was said to have "stolen something from the gypsies".&lt;ref&gt;TV advertisement of 1966: ''Washes Whiter'' (BBC2, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

Beatlemania did not of itself create the apparent [[iconoclasm]] of the 1960s; however, as one writer put it, "just as [[Noël Coward]] and [[Cole Porter]] reflected the louche, carefree attitude of the [Nineteen] Twenties, so did the Beatles' music capture the rhythm of breaking free experienced by an entire generation of people growing up in the Sixties".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1990"/&gt; By the middle of the decade, British pop music had stimulated the fashion boom of what ''Time'' called  “[[swinging London]]”.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'', 15 April 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Associated initially with such "[[mod (subculture)|mod]]" designs as Quant's [[mini-skirt]], this soon embraced a range of essentially Bohemian styles. These included the military and Victorian fashions popularised by stars who frequented boutiques such as [[Granny Takes a Trip]], the "fusion of fashion, art and lifestyle" opened by [[Nigel Waymouth]] in the [[Kings Road|King's Road]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] in January 1966,&lt;ref&gt;See ''Times Magazine'', 24 June 2006; David Moss in ''Antiques Trade Gazette'', 27 August 2011 (number 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and, by 1967, the hippie look largely imported from America (although, as noted, London stores such as [[Biba]] had, for some time, displayed dresses that drew on Pre-Raphaelite imagery&lt;ref&gt;Fiona MacCathy (2011) ''The Last Pre-Raphaelite''&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[Rolling Stones]]' [[Keith Richards]], whose early girl friend, [[Linda Keith]], had, in her late teens, been a bohemian force in [[West Hampstead]], noted on the Stones' return from an American tour in 1967 how quickly hippiedom had transformed the London scene.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Richards (2010) ''Life''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victorian imagery===
[[Image:Alice par John Tenniel 04.png|thumb|130px|right|[[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice in Wonderland|Alice]] ([[John Tenniel]])]]
This fusion of influences was discernible in two black-and-white productions for [[BBC]] television in 1966: the series ''[[Adam Adamant Lives!]]'', starring [[Gerald Harper]] as an Edwardian adventurer who had been [[cryopreservation|cryopreserved]] in time and [[Juliet Harmer]] as [[Georgina Jones]], a stylish "mod" who befriended him, and [[Jonathan Miller]]'s dreamy, rather [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] production of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s mid-Victorian children's fantasy ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1865).&lt;ref&gt;Miller's production starred 13-year-old [[Anne-Marie Mallik]] in her only known acting role.&lt;/ref&gt; (Confirming the aspiration, [[Sydney Newman]], the BBC's Head of Television Drama in the 1960s, reflected of ''Adam Adamant'' that "[they] could never quite get [the] Victorian mentality to contrast with the '60s".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Pixley (2006) DVD viewing notes for ''Adam Adamant Lives!''&lt;/ref&gt;)

On the face of it, Carroll (a pseudonym for Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) had been a rather conventional and repressed [[Oxford University|Oxford]] [[University don]], but he was a keen and artistic photographer in the early days of that medium (taking, among other things, rather bohemian looking pictures of [[Alice Liddell]] and other young girls)&lt;ref&gt;Simon Winchester (2011) ''The Alice Behind Wonderland''. Alice Liddell, the inspiration for ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', was the daughter of [[Henry Liddell]], Dean of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where Dodgson was a Fellow.&lt;/ref&gt; and he developed an empathy and friendship with several of the Pre-Raphaelites;&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Lovett Stoffel (1997) ''Lewis Carroll and Alice'', ‘[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]’ series.&lt;/ref&gt; the sculptor [[Thomas Woolner]] and possibly even Rossetti dissuaded him from illustrating ''Alice'' himself,&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lancelyn Green (1960) in ''Aspects of Alice'' (ed. Robert Phliips, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; a task that was undertaken instead by [[John Tenniel]]. The imagery of ''Alice'', both textually and graphically, lent itself well to the psychedelia of the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Fensch (1968) "Alice – the First Acidhead" in ''Aspects of Alice'', ''op,cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; In America, this was apparent in, among other ways, the "Alice happening" in [[Central Park]], New York (1968) when naked participants covered themselves in [[polka dots]]&lt;ref&gt;Waldemar Januszczak in ''Sunday Times Culture'', 27 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the lyrics to [[Grace Slick]]'s song "[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]" (1966) – "One pill makes you larger/And one pill makes you small" – that she performed with both the [[The Great Society (band)|Great Society]] and Jefferson Airplane, including with the latter at Woodstock in 1969.

==Women in the late 1960s and early 1970s==
[[Image:1970s Laura Ashley dresses 03.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mid 1970s dresses by Laura Ashley exhibited at the [[Fashion Museum, Bath]] in 2013]]
By the late 1960s shops such as [[Laura Ashley]] (whose first London outlet opened in 1968&lt;ref&gt;The first American branch of Laura Ashley opened in San Francisco in 1974, but had closed by the time a shop opened in New York in 1981 (Laura Ashley products having been sold in [[Bloomingdales]] and [[Macy's]] department stores for some years): Anne Sebba (1990) ''Laura Ashley: a Life By Design''&lt;/ref&gt;) were routinely promoting the "peasant look" and selling a range of "uniquely eccentric clothes ... The magic was being able to step into a 'Laura Ashley' dress and imagine you had found something out of a dressing-up box".&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, ''op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; At around the same time too, and into the 1970s, the brassière (or bra), which, as noted, had been seen as a liberating innovation in the early part of the century, came to be regarded by some women, such as the Australian academic [[Germaine Greer]] (''[[The Female Eunuch]]'', 1969), as an unduly restrictive symbol of traditional womanhood. However, the much-publicised incidence of "[[bra burning]]" in the 1970s tended to be overstated and came to be satirised: for example, in the 1973 film, ''[[Carry On Girls]]'', and a poster by Young &amp; Rubicam,&lt;ref&gt;Nick Souter &amp; Auart Newman (1987) ''The Postter Handbook''&lt;/ref&gt; one of a mildly subversive series for [[Smirnoff vodka]]: "I never thought of burning my bra until I discovered Smirnoff". It was also seen by many, including Greer herself, as a distraction from the cause of [[feminist movement|women's "liberation"]].&lt;ref&gt;In 2013 ''[[The Oldie]]'' published a cartoon depicting women [[suffragettes]] of the early 20th century with the caption "... but I'm not sure about this proposal to burn our [[whalebone]] corsets" (''Oldie'', February 2013). A pragmatic 21st-century view was that "feminism is not about burning your bra in the street. It is about [among other things] women getting up in the morning and leaving the house to go to a job that pays them an actual wage ..." (Laura Smith, letter in ''Metro'', 30 October 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Vermont]] lawyer later observed wryly that "like every good feminist-in-training in the sixties, I burned my bra", but that "now it's the nineties ... I realize [[Playtex]] [underwear manufacturer] had supported me better than any man I know."&lt;ref&gt;Susan Sweetser, quoted in ''Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations'' (5th edition, ed Gyles Brandreth, 2013) 119:13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claire Perry]], who became a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] in 2010 and later a government minister, reflected that, as a "women's officer" at Oxford University in the early 1980s, she was "a bra-burning feminist with a hideous [[new romantic|new-romantic]] haircut", but that her feminism had, in her view, matured.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Rachel Sylvester &amp; Alice Thomson, ''The Times'', 2 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Girl power"===
By the mid-1980s, the American singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] had turned the bra into a positive, even provocative, fashion statement. Madonna's flamboyant and gritty style (notably seen to bohemian effect alongside [[Rosanna Arquette]] in the 1985 film, ''[[Desperately Seeking Susan]]'') was, in turn, a precursor of so-called "[[girl power]]" that was associated in the 1990s with various prominent young women (such as singers [[Courtney Love]], who played the 1999 [[Glastonbury Festival]] in a headline-grabbing pink bra,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 26 July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and the more commercially oriented [[Spice Girls]]) and offbeat or quirky American television series (''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'', ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Caroline in the City]]'', ''[[Sex and the City]]'').

==Since the 1960s: hippie/boho-chic==
{{main article|Boho-chic}}

[[File:She &amp; Him at NFF.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Zooey Deschanel]] (left) with [[M. Ward]], [[Newport Folk Festival]], 2008]]
Journalist Bob Stanley remarked that "the late 1960s are never entirely out of fashion, they just need a fresh angle to make them ''de jour''".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Knowledge'', 24 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the features of hippie fashion re-emerged at various stages during the ensuing forty years.

In the mid-to-late 1980s, variants of the short and fundamentally un-Bohemian [[rah-rah skirt]] (which originated with [[cheerleading|cheerleaders]]) were combined with leather or demin to create a look with some Bohemian or even [[Gothic fashion|gothic]] features (for example, by the singing duo [[Strawberry Switchblade]] who took inspiration from 1970s [[punk fashion]]&lt;ref&gt;Photographs for album, ''Since Yesterday'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;). In the 1990s the term, "hippie [[chic (style)|chic]]", was applied to [[Tom Ford]]’s collections for the Italian house of [[Gucci]]. These drew on, among other influences, the style, popular in retrospect, of [[Talitha Getty]] (died 1971), actress wife of [[John Paul Getty III|John Paul Getty]] and step-granddaughter of Dorelia McNeil, who was represented most famously in a photograph of her and her husband taken by [[Patrick Lichfield]] in [[Marrakesh]], Morocco in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Lichfield (1981) ''The Most Beautiful Women''. See http://www.blackbookmag.com/article/guccis-cruise-wear-for-earth-mamas/3399&lt;/ref&gt; Recalling the influx of hippies into Marrakesh in 1968, [[Richard Neville (writer)|Richard Neville]], then editor of ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'', wrote that "the dapper drifters in embroidered skirts and [[cowboy boots]] were so delighted by the bright satin '50s underwear favoured by the matrons of Marrakesh that they wore them outside their denims à la Madonna [the singer] twenty-five years later".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Neville (1995) ''Hippie Hippie Shake''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, "boho-chic" was associated initially with supermodel [[Kate Moss]] and then, as a highly popular style in 2004-5, with actress [[Sienna Miller]]. In America similar styles were sometimes referred to as "[[Bourgeois bohemian|bobo]]-" or "ashcan chic", or "[[luxe grunge]]", their leading proponents including actresses [[Mary-Kate Olsen]] and [[Zooey Deschanel]]. As if to illustrate the cyclical nature of fashion, by the end of the [[noughties]] strong pre-Raphaelite traits were notable in, among others, singer [[Florence Welch]], model [[Karen Elson]] and designer [[Anna Sui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/style/celebrity-fashion/kate-middleton-wears-aw15-anna-7740620 |title=Kate Middleton wears AW15 Anna Sui as she changes into a floaty maxi dress for National Park visit |last1=Stacey |first1=Danielle |last2= |first2= |date=April 12, 2016 |website=mirror.co.uk |publisher=Mirror |access-date=November 3, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, terms like ''Bionade-Bourgeoisie'', ''[[Bionade-Biedermeier]] or'' ''Biohème'' refer to former Bohemians that gained a sort of [[Cultural hegemony]] with their  [[LOHAS|LOHA]] lifestyle&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Kathrin Hartmann|Title=Ende der Märchenstunde: Wie die Industrie die Lohas und Lifestyle-Ökos vereinnahmt |Publisher=Karl Blessing Verlag|ISBN=978-3-641-03632-4|language=German|URL=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zkkq2wcc9AC|Format= books.google.com|AccessDate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;- The phenomen of such former (young) bohemians becoming establishment during the years is a typical aspect of [[gentrification]] processes.

'''''Café Terrace at Night''''' is an 1888 oil painting by the Dutch artist [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It is also known as '''''The Cafe Terrace on the Place du Forum''''', and, when first exhibited in 1891, was entitled '''''Coffeehouse, in the evening''''' (''Café, le soir'').

Van Gogh painted ''Café Terrace at Night'' in [[Arles]], France, in mid-September 1888. The painting is not signed, but described and mentioned by the artist in three letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/search/advanced?originaltext=original&amp;translation=translation&amp;annotations=notes&amp;essays=essays&amp;other=other&amp;from=1&amp;to=1&amp;date_from=1872-09-29&amp;date_until=1890-07-31&amp;order=date&amp;workofart_code=i2714 See www.vangoghletters.org, Advanced Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

Visitors to the site can stand at the northeastern corner of the ''Place du Forum'', where the artist set up his easel. The site was refurbished in 1990 and 1991 to replicate van Gogh's painting. He looked south towards the artificially lit [[sidewalk cafe|terrace]] of the popular coffee house, as well as into the enforced darkness of the ''rue du Palais'' which led up to a building structure (to the left, not pictured) and, beyond this structure, the tower of a former church which is now ''Musée Lapidaire''.

Towards the right, Van Gogh indicated a lighted shop as well, and some branches of the trees surrounding the place—but he omitted the remainders of the Roman monuments just beside this little shop.

The painting is currently at the [[Kröller-Müller Museum]] in [[Otterlo]], Netherlands.

==Genesis==
[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Cafe Terrace at Night (1888).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Preparatory study for the  painting, September 1888.&lt;br&gt;(F1519) [[Dallas Museum of Art]], The Wendy and Emery Reves Collection.]]
After finishing ''Café Terrace at Night'', Van Gogh wrote a letter to his sister expressing his enthusiasm:

{{quote|I was interrupted precisely by the work that a new painting of the outside of a café in the evening has been giving me these past few days. On the terrace, there are little figures of people drinking. A huge yellow lantern lights the terrace, the façade, the pavement, and even projects light over the cobblestones of the street, which takes on a violet-pink tinge. The gables of the houses on a street that leads away under the blue sky studded with stars are dark blue or violet, with a green tree. Now there’s a painting of night without black. With nothing but beautiful blue, violet and green, and in these surroundings the lighted square is coloured pale sulphur, lemon green. I enormously enjoy painting on the spot at night. In the past they used to draw, and paint the picture from the drawing in the daytime. But I find that it suits me to paint the thing straightaway. It’s quite true that I may take a blue for a green in the dark, a blue lilac for a pink lilac, since you can’t make out the nature of the tone clearly. But it’s the only way of getting away from the conventional black night with a poor, pallid and whitish light, while in fact a mere candle by itself gives us the richest yellows and oranges.&lt;ref name=let678&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let678/letter.html Letter 678 (in French)]  from Vincent van Gogh to Wilhelmina van Gogh, Arles, 9 and 16 September 1888&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He continues, in this same letter, {{quote|You never told me if you had read Guy de Maupassant’s Bel-ami, and what you now think of his talent in general. I say this because the beginning of Bel-ami is precisely the description of a starry night in Paris, with the lighted cafés of the boulevard, and it’s something like the same subject that I’ve painted just now.&lt;ref name=let678/&gt;}}

[[File:Van gogh cafe arles.jpg|thumb|upright|The café terrace, now 'Le Café La Nuit', at Place du Forum, [[Arles]], July 2016]]
This excerpt forms the basis of the  [[Van Gogh Museum|Van Gogh Museum's]] curators' opinion that the painting is a depiction "''of drinkers in the harsh, bright lights of their illuminated facades''" from [[Guy de Maupassant|Maupassant]]'s novel ''[[Bel Ami]]'', however, they also note that Maupassant makes no mention of a 'starry sky.'&lt;ref name=let678/&gt;
In 1981, Bogomila Welsh-Ovcharov argued that since it "displays not only a night scene but also a funnel-like perspective and dominant blue-yellow tonality" it was at least partially inspired by [[Louis Anquetin|Louis Anquetin's]] ''Avenue de Clichy: 5 o'clock in the evening.''&lt;ref&gt;Welsh-Ovcharov, Bogomila: ''Vincent van Gogh and the Birth of Cloisonism'' (!), Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 24 January - 22 March 1981 and Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, Amsterdam, 9 April - 14 June 1989  {{ISBN|0-919876-66-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An academic paper presented at [[IAFOR]]'s 2013 European Conference on Arts &amp; Humanities, however, advanced the theory that van Gogh intended the painting to be a uniquely innovated ''[[Last Supper]]''. The paper was subsequently published by The Art Histories Society in the January, 2014 ''Art History Supplement''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arths.org.uk/about/arthsa/issue41 See ''Art History Supplement'' vol. 4, issue 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106100842/http://www.arths.org.uk/about/arthsa/issue41 |date=2014-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the July, 2014 fourteenth volume of ''The Anistoriton Journal of History, Archaeology and Art History''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anistor.gr/english/index.htm See ''Anistoriton Journal of History, Archaeology and Art History'' Volume 14]&lt;/ref&gt;

Briefly, the paper examines the myriad artistic influences van Gogh was parsing the summer of 1888: his lifelong devotion to and imitation of [[Jesus Christ]]; synthesizing ''[[Japonism]]'' and ''[[Cloisonnism]]'' with his own ''[[plein air]]'' techniques; colorizing [[Jean-François Millet]]'s pious genre scenes with [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s luminous palette (see [[Boats du Rhône]]); "search-for-sacred-realism" correspondence with his artist friend [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]]; [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Boccaccio]]'s examples of dressing old ideas in new clothes; an [[Émile-Louis Burnouf|Émile Burnouf]] article claiming Buddhist missionaries sowed the seeds [[Essenes]] later reaped as Christianity; failed attempts creating his own Christ in the Garden of Olives; two proximal ''Last Supper'' studies (''[[Interior of a Restaurant in Arles]]'' and ''[[Interior of a Restaurant in Arles|Interior of the Restaurant Carrel in Arles]]'') featuring straw-bottomed chairs he'd just purchased by the dozen (hoping to start a commune of twelve "artist-apostles" at his [[The Yellow House (painting)|Yellow House]]); culminating with his composition of twelve diners drenched in a yellow halo surrounding a Rembrandtesque server framed by a crucifix at the vanishing point of the picture; it's concluded his original starry night is a [[Symbolist|Symbolist's]] ''Last Supper''.

Although van Gogh never explicitly mentioned his intent in any existing letter, he did write his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] two weeks later, "That doesn't stop me having a terrible need for - dare I say the word - for religion. So I go outside at night to paint the stars and I always dream a painting like that with a group of living figures of the pals."&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let691/letter.html www.vangoghletters.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Night effects==
When exhibited for the first time, in 1891, the painting was entitled '''''Coffeehouse, in the evening''''' (''Café, le soir'').

This is the first painting in which he used starry backgrounds; he went on to paint star-filled skies in ''[[Starry Night Over the Rhône]]'' (painted the same month), and the better known ''[[The Starry Night]]'' a year later. Van Gogh also painted a starlight background in ''[[Portrait of Eugène Boch]]''.  Van Gogh mentioned the ''Cafe Terrace'' painting in a letter written to [[Eugène Boch]] on October 2, 1888, writing he had painted "a view of the café on place du Forum, where we used to go, ''painted at night''" (emphasis van Gogh's).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eugeneboch.com/letter.htm Letter to Eugene Boch mentioning the Cafe Terrace] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729172453/http://www.eugeneboch.com/letter.htm |date=2012-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting and the café were both featured in the 1956 film ''[[Lust for Life (film)|Lust for Life]]'' starring [[Kirk Douglas]] and later in "[[Vincent and the Doctor]]" (2010), the tenth episode in the [[Doctor Who (series 5)|fifth series]] of British [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=A Brush with Genius|series=[[Doctor Who Confidential]]|airdate=5 June 2010|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Three]]|seriesno=5|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the fully painted film ''[[Loving Vincent]]'' (2017).

== Color ==
"This is a night painting without black, with nothing but beautiful blue and violet and green and in this surrounding the illuminated area colors itself sulfur pale yellow and citron green."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-van-gogh-vincent-artworks.htm|title=Vincent van Gogh Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|work=The Art Story|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10410">'''Creative peacebuilding''' is the larger name for artist approaches to [[peacebuilding]] within individuals, groups, and societies. It includes various forms of [[art therapy]], whereby individuals and groups can express themselves to nurture healing and restoration. It is also used to overcome the recurrence of [[violence]], as a preventative measure to make the foundations of peace stronger, especially in contexts of war and conflict. Creating an environment of lasting peace is the primary goal of creative peacebuilding.

== War and conflict ==
According to [[Johan Galtung]], peacebuilding is the process of creating self-supporting structures that "remove causes of wars and offer alternatives to war in situations where wars might occur."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/2013/08/selected-definitions-of-peacebuilding/|title=Selected Definitions of Peacebuilding|work=Alliance for Peacebuilding|access-date=10 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[John Paul Lederach]], peacebuilding is a comprehensive concept that encompasses, generates, and sustains the full array of processes, approaches, and stages needed to transform conflict toward more sustainable, peaceful relationships, which involves a wide range of activities. It has a diverse range of interaction and involves various stakeholders in various levels within the spectrum of governance and development.&lt;ref name="Lederach2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UL8VDAAAQBAJ|title=The Moral Imagination: The Art and Soul of Building Peace|last=Lederach|first=John Paul|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-974758-0|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative peacebuilding facilitates the establishments of sustainable peace by preventing recurrence of violence, addresses the root causes, healing and effects of conflict, and offer alternatives to violence through reconciliation, economic and social transformation with the use of photography, film, painting, and the like. [[Jolyon Mitchell]] argues that the visual arts can both encourage peacebuilding and instigating violence. This is true of various forms of visual arts, ranging from posters, cartoons, and stained glass, to websites, radio, and films by reflecting on examples from around the world.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jLGcNb1_H1YC|title=Promoting Peace, Inciting Violence: The Role of Religion and Media|last=Mitchell|first=Jolyon P.|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-55746-7|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative peacebuilding can be especially powerful when used with those suffering from a young demographic and those with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. For at-risk youth, it lays the roots for a peaceful lifestyle and to help children who have already experienced trauma in their lives become fully functional adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ishaq|first=Ashfaq|date=December 2006|title=Development of children’s creativity to foster peace|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(06)69915-7/abstract|journal=The Lancet|volume=368|pages=26–27|via=|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69915-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art therapy==
Art therapy has been used to help rehabilitate [[child soldiers]] in [[Uganda]] as well as to help children who lost their homes in the [[tsunami]] of 2004 cope with their feelings. Many youth centers catering to impoverished children use art forms to build community, discipline and trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prutzman|first=Priscilla|date=October 1981|title=Children's Creative Response to Conflict|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0130.1981.tb00454.x|journal=Peace and Change|volume=7|issue=4|pages=77–79|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0130.1981.tb00454.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
[[Music therapy]] can be used in several different fashions to build peace. It can be used to help individuals express themselves or to foster communication between individuals or groups of people. It can be used to nurture healing and reconciliation. Music is something that transcends language and national or ethnic boundaries. It has unique styles depending on the community it originates in and can also be adapted to fit individual's tastes. When two groups who have been in conflict or have the potential for conflict make music together communication and healing become possible. When individuals listen to or play music, they can reduce their [[stress (biology)|stress]] levels and express their feelings.&lt;ref name="Sutton2002"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Z3jtH_qeIIC|title=Music, Music Therapy and Trauma: International Perspectives|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year=2002|isbn=978-1-84310-027-0|editor-last=Sutton|editor-first=Julie P.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual arts ===
Visual art therapy can be used to help individuals cope with their feelings resulting from violent experiences. It is also used to treat [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]. Art therapy is especially useful for people who are having trouble verbalizing their feelings and are keeping them bottled up. By sharing their experiences and processing them through a tactical and visual activity, people are able to heal. No prior experience with visual art is needed to participate in and gain benefits from art therapy—it is about the process of creation, not about the aesthetic appeal of the product. Art therapy can be used in group settings as well—creating a collaborative art project can be an experience that bridges differences between people and builds feelings of trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Avrahami|first=Dalia|date=2006|title=Visual Art Therapy's Unique Contribution in the Treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J229v06n04_02|journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|volume=6|issue=4|pages=5–38|doi=10.1300/j229v06n04_02|issn=1529-9732|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visualization and technology ===
If people who have lived through traumatic or violent experiences can relive them and change the situation or their response to the situation they can come to terms with their past. Virtual technology and especially [[virtual reality]] simulations can be especially useful in cases like these and have been used to treat veterans of [[Iraq War|the Iraq war]] who are suffering from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. If the technology needed for these simulations is too expensive to be practical, mental [[Creative visualization|visualization]], in which the victim uses their imagination to create situations and feel as if they are gaining control of the way events play out, can be used as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/world/iraq/2007-06-18-iraq-virtual-reality_n.htm|title=Iraq vets use virtual reality to ease post-battle trauma|last=Jones|first=Brent|date=18 June 2007|website=www.usatoday.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Create Peace Project===
Create Peace Project is an arts-for-peace education organization working to promote the practices of peace and spread the message of hope and goodwill to children around the world using creativity. Create Peace Project was founded in San Francisco, California in 2007 by artist and peace activist Ross Holzman in response to the overwhelming amount of violence in the world, on the news, and in our communities. Violence, coupled with the lack of creativity in peoples lives sparked the creation of projects such as Banners for Peace and The Peace Exchange. Create Peace Project has included more than 25,000 children from around the world in its arts-for-peace projects since its inception and continues to work with schools in the US and beyond promoting peace through creativity to children of all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.createpeaceproject.org|title=Create Peace Project|last=Holzman|first=Ross|date=8 May 2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barefoot artists===
Artist [[Lily Yeh]] has helped to heal the wounds [[genocide]] left on a village of widows and orphans through her work with Barefoot Artists. The members of the community were provided with a chance to honor their lost loved ones through their construction of a beautiful and expressive monument commemorating the mass grave of the local victims of the genocide. The construction process also provided a sense of closure to their mourning. Other aspects of the peacebuilding process in the village included paintings on building walls created by the village children of things that they hoped to see in the future as well as things important to their everyday existence. On the economic side of this peacebuilding effort, the people of the village learned how to mosaic and pour concrete, two useful and marketable skills to help provide economic stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://barefootartists.org/|title=Barefoot Artists|last=Yeh|first=Lily|date=|website=Barefoot Artists|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===River City Drum Corps===
In the United State, creative peacebuilding is used in many inner-city areas in places such as New York, Philadelphia, and Louisville. The River City Drum Corps in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville, Ky]] provides a musical outlet for children who perhaps are not listened to in other parts of their lives. It is also a structured program where discipline and the importance of both uniqueness and teamwork are taught. The children learn drumming patterns and perform for different events and groups of people throughout the city. Both the children in the program and their audience benefit from the cultural exchange and communication that take place during drum corps performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rivercitydrumcorpky.com/rcdc/|title=About RCDC|last=|first=|date=|website=River City Drum Corp|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Culture.pl''' is a large [[web portal]] devoted to [[Culture of Poland|Polish culture]]. It was founded by the [[Adam Mickiewicz Institute]] in March 2001. Written in Polish, English and Russian, the site promotes the work of Polish artists around the world and is a popular information database on all artistic aspects of Polish culture. Its [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]] number is 1734-0624.

== Structure ==

As well as acting as a database, the site covers current cultural events related to Poland, especially those that take place in other countries. According to its website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.pl/en/article/culturepl-how-it-all-began|title=Culture.pl: How it All Began - Article - Culture.pl|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of 2015 Culture.pl has around 38,000 articles (8,000 of which are in English) shared across the categories Music, Visual Arts, Film, Theatre, Dance, Literature, Comics, Architecture, Photography, Design, and Other. While a large part of the site is on Polish artists and their works, there is also information on around 700 cultural institutions such as museums, galleries, philharmonic halls, theatres and art schools. Many articles are written in English and specifically aimed at international audiences.

The portal was founded in March 2001. The project was initially conceived and designed by Andrzej Lubomirski, who also acted as editor-in-chief until 2008. Subsequent editors-in-chief have included Monika Rencławowicz (2008 – 2009), Elżbieta Sawicka (2009 – 2012), Weronika Kostyrko (2012 – 2016) and John Beauchamp (2016 – present).

'''The David Plates''' are a set of nine silver plates, in three sizes, stamped between 613 and 630. The plates were created in [[Constantinople]], each depicting a scene from the life of the Hebrew king [[David]], and associated with the reign of Emperor [[Heraclius]] (610-641).&lt;ref&gt;Cormack, Robin. Byzantine Art. Oxford U. Press. 2000.  Print. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following their discovery in [[Karavas]] (northern [[Cyprus]]) in 1902, the David Plates have been considered key additions to early Byzantine secular art. It is also noted that the David Plates were found amongst the Second Cyprus Treasure. Casual laborers from the village of Karavas found the David Plates as they were quarrying the ruins for construction stones.&lt;ref&gt;Leader, Ruth. The David Plates Revisited: Transforming the Secular in Early Byzantium. The Art Bulletin, Vol. 82, No 3 (Sept. 2000) pgs 407-427. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3051395&lt;/ref&gt; The finders, however, failed to report what they had discovered to the Cypriot authorities. When authorities learned of their taking they confiscated three of the David Plates alongside a pair of cross-monogram plates, and other jewelry held today in the [[Cyprus Museum|Museum of Antiquities]] in [[Nicosia]]. The rest of the discovery was smuggled from Cyprus and traded to a dealer located in [[Paris]]. Most of this hoard was bought by [[J. Pierpont Morgan]] and was later given to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]] by his heirs in 1917, where they currently remain.

== Large, Center Plate ==

* David battles [[Goliath]]. Size and weight: 19 7/16 x 2 5/8 in., 203.9oz. (49.4 x 6.6&amp;nbsp;cm, 5780g)

* Saul Arms David
* Marriage of David and [[Michal]]

== Smaller plates ==

* David's Confrontation with [[Eliab]]

== Manufacture ==
The David Plates are of extremely high quality, pointing the source of production to the palace workshops in Constantinople that was known for the manufacture of specific luxury commodities. The plates have control stamps by the Byzantine emperor Heraclius to assure the quality of silver used to make them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Masterwork of Byzantine Art: The David Plates; The Story of David and Goliath|last=Norris|first=Michael|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nine silver plates were made in three sizes; one large plate, four medium plates and another four small plates.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Suzanne Spain. "Heraclius, Byzantine imperial ideology, and the David plates." Speculum 52.2 (1977): 234.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the form, the plates are similar, with rolled rims, concave surfaces, and a high foot ring.

== Commission ==
The stamps offer an intriguing aspect of relating the David Plates to Heraclius’ rule. It is often thought that the set could have been commissioned to celebrate the defeat of the [[Sasanian Empire]] (628-629) by Heraclius. He managed to end a long war with [[Persia]] and retook control over [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], and other Byzantine regions. Specifically, Heraclius regained the Byzantine territories that included [[Jerusalem]] (founded by King David) and the Sasanian city of [[Ctesiphon]]. The Sasanian War echoed David’s victory over Goliath as he also beheaded his enemy, giving him the acclaim of being the new David. The emperor’s image as the new David par excellence might have been praised to celebrate past achievement as well as promote confidence in the present and future. The last years on the control stamps, therefore, are seen as the most likely for the development of David Plates. It is thought that Heraclius ordered the commission of the David Plates for their intrinsic [[value (economics)|value]]. More aspects are still being studied to point out their true reality in Byzantine art history.

== Relationship with the life of King David ==
Various artists and intellects have established the possible relationship between the plates and the life of King David. The David Plates are associated with the period after the victory of King David over the Persians when Emperor Heraclius was often concerned with his role in history, authority, and image. Other proponents also claim that each plate is associated specifically with King David, from the time [[Samuel]] anointed him to the time he married Saul's daughter. The slight contradictions of the period relating to the plates can be understood since the plates are among the most ancient components of Byzantine art. The explanations that can be retrieved today are only significant regarding the accuracy of the dates established in the writings. The exact periods that the plates describe appear to be contradicting in different writings, but the general information that the writers seek to pass is rather similar. Between 1970 and 1978, there were five readings about the plates, each associated with some deficiencies in information and accuracy in time.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Marvin C. "A Byzantine gold medallion at Dumbarton Oaks." Dumbarton Oaks Papers 11 (1957): 247-261.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are certain discrepancies in the information that the writers passed, all readings accept the fact that Heraclius had a significant role in the design of the plates. Furthermore, the David plates evoke the significant victories during the reign of Emperor Heraclius.

The '''''Fountain of Neptune''''' ({{lang-it|Fontana del Nettuno}}) is a fountain in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], situated on the [[Piazza della Signoria]] (Signoria square), in front of the [[Palazzo Vecchio]]. Made of marble and bronze, the fountain was commissioned in 1565 and designed by Baccio Bandinelli. It is the work of the sculptor [[Bartolomeo Ammannati]] with some elements created by collaborators. For example, the bronze sea-horses are the work of Giovanni da Bologna, often called [[Giambologna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3UIYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=FOUNTAIN+OF+NEPTUNE++florence+bronze+sea-horses+by+Giovanni+da+Bologna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikp_Ss4-jUAhUjw4MKHUc0CeoQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=FOUNTAIN+OF+NEPTUNE++florence+bronze+sea-horses+by+Giovanni+da+Bologna&amp;f=false|title=Walks in Florence and Its Environs|first1=Susan|last1=Horner|first2=Joanna B.|last2=Horner|date=9 August 1884|page=199|publisher=Smith|accessdate=9 August 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==

In 1559, [[Cosimo I de' Medici]] launched a competition to design a fountain at a time when a new aqueduct was also being built, the first to bring running water to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/13/arts/13iht-ammannati13.html|title=In Florence, Revelations in Stone|first=Roderick Conway|last=Morris|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was for a statue of Neptune as the primary element, in a chariot drawn by sea-horses, symbolizing Florence's command of the Mediterranean. Initially, Baccio Bandinelli was the sculptor chosen but he died before work began. Sculptor Ammannati was hired to take over and completed the work with assistants and collaborators. The face of Neptune is said to resemble that of the Grand Duke Cosimo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFB6V8TekrcC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=FOUNTAIN+OF+NEPTUNE++florence+face+of+cosimo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=FOUNTAIN+OF+NEPTUNE++florence+face+of+cosimo&amp;f=false,|title=Renaissance Florence: A Social History|first1=Roger J.|last1=Crum|first2=Roger J.|last2=Crum|first3=John T.|last3=Paoletti|date=3 April 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=133|accessdate=9 August 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4.2 meter tall Neptune figure, made of Apuan marble, was completed in 1565 in time for the wedding of Francesco de' Medici I to grand duchess Johanna of Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumsinflorence.com/musei/Palazzo_vecchio.html|title=Palazzo Vecchio and Piazza Signoria - Florence|website=Museumsinflorence.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Florentines were not impressed and called the statue "Il Biancone" ("the white giant").&lt;ref name="theflorentine.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theflorentine.net/art-culture/2016/07/new-life-neptune-fountain/|title=New life for the Neptune Fountain - The Florentine|date=12 July 2016|website=Theflorentine.net|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFhVehAvVyUC&amp;pg=PA460&amp;dq=FOUNTAIN+OF+NEPTUNE++florence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=FOUNTAIN+OF+NEPTUNE++florence&amp;f=false|title=Art in Renaissance Italy|first1=John T.|last1=Paoletti|first2=Gary M.|last2=Radke|date=9 August 2018|page=460|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|accessdate=9 August 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work on the basin and other aspects of the fountain required nearly ten years. Ammannati and his collaborators added around the perimeter of the basin in a [[mannerist]] style, reclining, bronze river gods, laughing [[satyr]]s and marble [[sea-horse]]s emerging from the water. The pedestal on which the statue stands is in the center of the octagonal fountain. It is decorated with the mythical figures of [[Scylla]] and [[Charybdis]]. The final work was completed in December 1574. The statue on display today is a copy made in the 1800s when the original was moved to the National Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6lkr32g6y8C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=FOUNTAIN+OF+NEPTUNE+%5B%5BScylla%5D%5D+and+%5B%5BCharybdis%5D%5D.++florence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OYKZKWJ1Xk&amp;sig=CoQowv5zaHU2FV0HeChtzYgIbd0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-x-at3ujUAhWq1IMKHXbCBCMQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=FOUNTAIN+OF+NEPTUNE+%5B%5BScylla%5D%5D+and+%5B%5BCharybdis%5D%5D.++florence&amp;f=false|title=Three Months in Florence|first=Mary|last=Carter|date=30 July 2013|page=59|publisher=Kensington Books|accessdate=9 August 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theflorentine.net"/&gt;

==History of vandalism==
[[File:Neptune fountain florence hand.jpg|thumb|The fountain after its hand was cut off by [[vandal]]s on the night of August 4, 2005]]

The fountain has suffered a great deal of damage during the centuries. It was used as a washbasin for inkpots and laundry at the end of the 16th century. It was vandalized on January 25, 1580. A satyr was stolen during the carnival in 1830. It was damaged again by the Bourbon bombardments of 1848. Subsequently, it has been the object of several restorations and substitutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theflorentine.net/lifestyle/2011/05/the-white-giant/|title=The White Giant - The Florentine|date=19 May 2011|website=Theflorentine.net|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 2005, the statue was the target of three [[vandals]] who climbed it, damaging one of the hands and the [[trident]] of Neptune. The act was recorded by [[security camera]]s. The statue was restored by 2007. Since then, security on the fountain has been taken very seriously. In late 2007, the statue was the target of attempted vandalism by four teens. The security cameras and nearby police ensured that no damage came to the fountain again and the four were arrested.

Although the damage was repaired, the fountain is undergoing a general restoration that started in September 2016 and is expected to conclude in 2018; during this time, the fountain is surrounded by a protective cage and sometimes, by scaffolding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.florencedailynews.com/2017/02/27/the-fountain-of-neptune-under-restoration-in-florence/|title=The Fountain of Neptune under restoration - Florence Daily News|date=27 February 2017|website=Florencedailynews.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theflorentine.net"/&gt;

==Similar statuary==
As would be expected, the Sea-God, Neptune is a frequent theme for fountains, and over a dozen [[Fountain of Neptune (disambiguation)|Fountains of Neptune]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; exist. In Florence, there is another fountain of Neptune is found in the [[Boboli Gardens]], behind the [[Palazzo Pitti]] in Florence. [[Giambologna]] sculpted a similar statue for the [[Fountain of Neptune, Bologna|similar fountain]] in [[Bologna]] in the 1560s. [[Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli]] created a nearly contemporary fountain in [[Messina]], Sicily. The [[Fountain of Neptune, Rome]] (Neptune fighting with an octopus) was completed in 1878 when the statue was added by Antonio della Bitta and sea creatures by [[Gregorio Zappalà]] for the theme "Nereids with cupids and walruses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutroma.com/Fountains-of-Rome.html|title=About Rome: Fountains of Rome|website=Aboutroma.com|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original basin was designed in 1574, by [[Giacomo Della Porta]], and built at about that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romaviva.com/Piazza-Navona/neptune_fountain.htm|title=Romaviva.com: Hotel a Roma - Prenota ora Alberghi e B&amp;B Roma|website=Roma Viva|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gavari''' is a 40-day ecstatic dance drama tradition dedicated to the [[Shakti]] [[avatar]] ''Gavari'' (aka ''Gavri'' or ''Gauri''), the principal deity of [[Mewar|Mewar's]] [[Bhil people|Bhil tribe]] in [[Rajasthan]], India. The Mewari Bhils honor Gavari as the creative protective spirit animating all life; and they perform this ritual annually to invoke, experience and celebrate Her powers.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58471382|title=Culture and customs of India|last=Henderson|first=Carol|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=|isbn=0313305137|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=141|oclc=58471382}}&lt;/ref&gt; This centuries-old ceremonial cycle employs austere discipline, [[Religious ecstasy|enraptured trance]], and wild theatrics to also convey ancient myths, historic events, tribal lore, and satiric political commentary. Among all the world’s folk performance traditions, it is quite unique, especially with respect to its epiphanous energy, scale, duration, ascetic rigour and inspirational messaging as well as its still mysterious [[provenance]] and genesis.

== The Gavari Season ==
[[File:Masked Gavari Budia figure from rural Jaisamand troupe.jpg|Masked Gavari Budia figure from rural Jaisamand troupe|right|thumb]]
Each year, ''bhopa'' [[Shamanism|shamans]] from Mewar's Bhil communities petition the Goddess to permit their villagers to perform the Gavari ritual and to accompany them for the weeks of touring. The average wait time for her consent is about 4–5 years, and once the ritual cycle begins, she must also be successfully invoked before each daily ceremony. Only when she visibly possesses one or more troupe members can the dance dramas begin and the ritual proceed.

Each of the 25-25 participating communities forms and dispatches its own Gavari company of 20-80 members. The troupes crisscross Mewar performing more than 600 day-long village ceremonies in all. In total, Gavari troupes in total can play to over a quarter of a million people annually.

During the  40-day Gavari season, all players practice strict austerities to maintain reverent contact with the living earth and the [[Immanence|immanent spirit]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41143548|title=Tribal dances of India|last=|first=|date=1999|publisher=Discovery Pub.

They eat only a single meal each day during the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/keeping-history-alive-dramatically/article2273799.ece|title=Keeping history alive dramatically}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ethnoflorence.skynetblogs.be/mask-bhil-gavari-dance/|title=MASKINDIA BHIL GAVRI GAVARI DANCE Chhoti Undri village Rajasthan : ETHNOFLORENCE Indian and Himalayan folk and tribal arts|website=ethnoflorence.skynetblogs.be|language=fr|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final days, each troupe returns to its home village for a last performance and closing ceremonies. The cycle ends with an immersion rite to return the Goddess’s fertility to their waters and all night raucous celebrations.

==Dramas==

A Gavari troupe repertoire may include 10-15 classic traditional tales and new ones are still evolving, but the overarching themes are the sacredness of the natural world, radical human equality, and the feminine nature of the divine.  These values are reflected in traditional Bhil society where the environment is revered, hierarchy is abhorred, and women enjoy greater rights and status than in communities outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitra|first=Aparna|date=2008-06-01|title=The status of women among the scheduled tribes in India|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535707001254|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|series=Behavioral Dimensions of the Firm Special Issue|volume=37|issue=3|pages=1202–1217|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2006.12.077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianmirror.com/tribes/bhiltribe.html|title=Bhil tribal communities|last=|first=|date=|website=www.indianmirror.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Gavari’s many mythic dramas, two of the most popular and often repeated are ''Badalya Hindawa'' (The Banyan Swing) and ''Bhilurana'' (King of the Bhils).

''Badalya Hindawa'' recounts how the Goddess re-greened the Earth after a life-erasing flood and fiercely defends it thereafter from greed, stupidity and harm. The playlet features a powerful guru who loses his disciples beneath a sacred [[banyan]] tree and demands that the local king destroy it as an illicit source of power. The unnerved king complies and has the tree cut down. The Goddess and her [[devi]] sisters are outraged at this desecration and slip into his court disguised as acrobatic dancers to exact revenge. They lure the king close with their artistry, reveal their true nature, indict him for cowardice and sacrilege, and mortally terminate his reign.

[[File:Gavari_Bhilurana_scene_showing_Queen_Victoria_leading_Brit_invasion.jpg|alt=Bhilurana scene of British invaders|right|thumb|''Bhilurana: on left the British invaders, on right Bhils preparing to resist. The green parasol marks the Empress of India, Queen Victoria; the red Goddess Kali, the Bhils’ secret power source.'']]  ''Bhilurana'' is the tale of a composite leader representing five centuries of Bhil resistance to intrusions of all kinds. The play compresses and conflates the armed might of Turkic, Mughal and British invaders and depicts Goddess-inspired Bhil warriors finally driving them all away with daring ambushes, sabotage and shrewd [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]].

Both plays end with celebration, salutations to the Goddess, and clear warnings to interlopers to never violate Nature or their sovereignty again.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gavari - Mewar’s electrifying tribal dance-drama: An Illustrated Introduction|last=Agneya|first=Harish|publisher=Tuneer Films|year=2014|isbn=978-9352123292|location=India|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gavari drama emphasis inspired [[improvisation]] over rehearsal and memorisation. The beginnings and ends of Gavari dramas are known, but how things transpire in between is highly mutable. There are no scripts and many players are illiterate farmers and labourers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/bhils|title=Bhils - Dictionary definition of Bhils {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual plays can continue for hours, contain long soliloquies and dialogues, and are only performed by a particular troupe once on four or five years. This intuitive improvisational approach fosters great creative diversity and different villages may present the same stories in many very different ways.  Players strive to perform in a receptive trance known as ''[[Bhava samadhi|bhava]]'', which resembles the fluid creative state that musicians and athletes call "flow" or "[[Flow (psychology)|the zone]]".

=== Characters ===

[[File:Gavari Budia player invoking the role's tutelary spirit.jpg|Budia player|right|thumb]]Depending on the day and the plays selected a single Gavari troupe can present dozens of different characters - goddess avatars, gods, demons, historical figures, sacred animals, corrupt officials, etc. The only constant roles, which exist outside the dramas, are the '''Budia''' figure, his twin '''Rai''' devi consorts and '''Kutkadia''', the  [[master of ceremonies]].

Women are not allowed to tour as actors with the troupe due to the 4-5 day [[Menstrual taboo|menstrual isolation]] Bhil women observe each month. Consequently, all female characters are portrayed by men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Budia embodies a powerful fusion of Shaivite and demonic energies and is a vital protective Gavari figure. He is distinguished by his dramatic horse hair-fringed mask, sacred staff and twin Rai consorts. In each day’s Gavari ceremony the Budia character has three main duties: circling the arena during opening invocations in the opposite direction as the dancers to seal in and protect the energy field they are generating; patrolling the arena perimeter during dance drama sequences to prevent audience members from entering the players' area or shaman circle unless they are clearly entranced; and periodically holding court at the arena’s edge with his Rai escorts to accept offerings on behalf of the troupe and confer blessings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gavari.info/gallery/the-many-faces-of-budia/|title=The Many Faces of Budia – Mewar Gavari|website=www.gavari.info|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Gavari village has its own iconic Budia mask, which is treated as a sacred object and often handed down for generations.

== History ==

=== Bhils ===

{{Main|Bhil people}}
One of India’s oldest and largest tribes, the [[Bhil people]] have primarily lived in the belt extending across contemporary [[Gujarat]], [[Rajasthan]], and [[Madhya Pradesh]] for at least 4,000 years.  About 10 million Bhils live in India today, but only the ±7% who reside in [[Mewar]] participate in the Gavari tradition.

=== Origin ===
There are many speculative theories about Gavari's genesis, but its true age and origin are unknown.

According to one hypothesis, it may have begun in rural Mewar at the end of the 16th century, when Mewaris largely regained control of their lands and lives from the Mughals in [[Battle of Haldighati#Aftermath|1579]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/469652456|title=Medieval India : from Sultanat to the Mughals|last=...|first=Chandra, Satish, 1922-|date=2005|publisher=Har-Anand Publications|year=|isbn=8124110662|edition=Revised|location=New Delhi|pages=121–122|oclc=469652456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/airavat/mughal-mewarconflict|title=mughal-mewarconflict - airavat|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Rajput court gratefully awarded their mountain-dwelling Bhil brethren both unprecedented recognition and vast tracts of fertile agricultural land. The latter boon gradually drew most Bhils out of their forest encampments and began their transition to village agriculture. The 16th century hypothesis thus holds that this settling down of a semi-nomadic people created a nostalgia for their more adventurous heritage. Others assert that Gavari began in the 3rd or 4th century in Gujarat,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and still others that it as old as Bhil culture itself and dates back four millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Rajasthan_State_Gazetteer_History_and_cu.html?id=ngZWAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Rajasthan State Gazetteer: History and culture|last=|first=|date=1995|publisher=Directorate, District Gazetteers, Government of Rajasthan|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=199, 205|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50712988|title=Fairs and festivals of Indian tribes|last=|first=|date=2003|publisher=Discovery Pub.

==Religious and shamanic aspects==
=== Invocations ===
[[File:Gavari ritual invocation gear.jpg|right|thumb|Ritual implements for invocation rites]]
Gavari troupes perform two  distinct invocation rituals.  The first is used to ask the Goddess to permit a village to perform the Gavari cycle. This invocation is held in every Mewari Bhil community on or shortly before the full moon in the Hindu month of ''[[Shravana]]'', which usually falls in August as the monsoon planting season ends.

The second is to confirm Her presence and participation at the start of each day's performance. Both invocations require [[Incense in India|incense]], flowers. [[chant]]ing, [[Madal|''madal'' drum]] and ''thali'' cymbal music, a [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] [[trishula]], and the kindling of a ''[[dhuni]] fire''.

Initial sanction invocations are usually held in a darkened sanctuary attended by a small group of ''bhopa'' shamans, village elders and veteran Gavari players. Other villagers gather outside to await Her decision which is delivered by a possessed trembling ''bhopa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=phRzAGYR9swC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=bhils+trance+invocatons&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Lfm8IUce62&amp;sig=GflvrHHPlRD5qRsjax96avnf7HY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMgMLayq7VAhUmR48KHWbKDuQQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=bhils%20trance%20invocatons&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopaedia of Sociology of Religion: Sociology of religions in India|last=Nayar|first=V.

Typical reasons for refusal include discord in the village, shrine disrepair, a poor monsoon, a crop blight, etc., which must be dealt with satisfactorily before petitioning Her again.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gavari.info/gavari-introduction/|title=Gavari Introduction – Mewar Gavari|website=www.gavari.info|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daily confirmation invocations are performed around an altar in the centre of the Gavari arena where shamans, musicians and senior players gather in a tight circle. The rest of the players and occasionally villagers dance counterclockwise around this core to create a welcoming energy field. A guardian  Budia figure circles the dancers in the opposite direction to seal in their energy and protect it from misuse. The Goddess spirit's arrival and presence is signaled by one or more ''bhopas'' falling into trembling [[Bhava samadhi|''bhava'' trance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://udaipurtimes.com/gavri-the-opera-of-mewar/|title=‘Gavri’ the Opera of Mewar|date=2010-09-28|work=UdaipurTimes.com|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other requisite ritual instruments used after Her manifestation include peacock feather [[sceptre]]s to dramatize and distribute possession's quivering energetic power, and heavy ''saankal'' chains with which trance-elated participants often beat their backs.

===Possession and Trance===
Successful invocations have several visible effects.

Finally, they can overwhelm some villagers with a sense of wonder, grace and bliss. Entranced villagers may be welcomed into the shaman circle or approached for healings and blessings by other members of the crowd. Those possessed often later report feelings of great exhilaration and selfless unity with all surrounding life. Such experiences reinforce Bhils' belief in Gavari's power, their own inalienable equality, and the sacredness of the natural world.

In Gavari, the beauty and power of the natural world are the ultimate expression of divinity.

'''Genre painting''', also called '''petit genre''', depicts aspects of [[everyday life]] by portraying ordinary people engaged in common activities. One common definition of a '''genre scene''' is that it shows figures to whom no identity can be attached either individually or collectively—thus distinguishing ''petit genre'' from [[history painting]]s (also called ''grand genre'') and [[portrait]]s. A work would often be considered as a genre work even if it could be shown that the artist had used a known person—a member of his family, say—as a model. In this case it would depend on whether the work was likely to have been intended by the artist to be perceived as a portrait—sometimes a subjective question. The depictions can be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Because of their familiar and frequently sentimental subject matter, genre paintings have often proven popular with the [[bourgeoisie]], or [[middle class]].
[[Image:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 014.jpg|thumb|280px|right|''Peasant Dance'', c. 1568, oil on wood, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]] the Elder]]

Genre subjects appear in many traditions of art. Painted decorations in [[Art of Ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian]] [[tomb]]s often depict banquets, recreation, and agrarian scenes, and [[Peiraikos]] is mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] as a [[Hellenistic]] panel painter of "low" subjects, such as survive in [[mosaic]] versions and provincial wall-paintings at [[Pompeii]]: "barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Book XXXV.112 of ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] often illustrated scenes of everyday peasant life, especially in the [[Labours of the Months]] in the calendar section of [[books of hours]], most famously the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]].

==To 1800==

The [[Low Countries]] dominated the field until the 18th century, and in the 17th century both [[Flemish Baroque painting]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] produced numerous specialists who mostly painted genre scenes.  In the previous century, the Flemish [[Renaissance]] painter [[Jan Sanders van Hemessen]] painted innovative large-scale genre scenes, sometimes including a moral theme or a religious scene in the background in the first half of the 16th century.  These were part of a pattern of "[[Mannerist]] inversion" in [[Antwerp]] painting, giving "low" elements previously in the decorative background of images prominent emphasis.  [[Joachim Patinir]] expanded [[landscape painting|his landscapes]], making the figures a small element, and [[Pieter Aertsen]] painted works dominated by spreads of [[still life]] food and genre figures of cooks or market-sellers, with small religious scenes in spaces in the background.  [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] made peasants and their activities, very naturalistically treated, the subject of many of his paintings, and genre painting was to flourish in Northern Europe in Brueghel's wake. 
[[File:Wybrand Hendriks - Interieur met naaiende vrouw.jpg|thumb|''Interior with Sewing Woman'', c. 1800-1810 by [[Wybrand Hendriks]] ]] [[Adriaen van Ostade|Adriaen]] and [[Isaac van Ostade]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Adriaan Brouwer]], [[David Teniers the Younger|David Teniers]], [[Aelbert Cuyp]], [[Johannes Vermeer]] and [[Pieter de Hooch]] were among the many painters specializing in genre subjects in the Low Countries during the 17th century. The generally small scale of these artists' paintings was appropriate for their display in the homes of middle class purchasers. Often the subject of a genre painting was based on a popular ''emblem'' from an [[Emblem book]]. This can give the painting a double meaning, such as in [[Gabriel Metsu]]'s [[:Image:Gabriel Metsu 003.jpg|''The Poultry seller'', 1662]], showing an old man offering a [[rooster]] in a symbolic pose that is based on a lewd engraving by Gillis van Breen (1595–1622), with the same scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/jong076erot01_01/jong076erot01_01_0001.htm | title=E. de Jongh, 'Erotica in vogelperspectief. De dubbelzinnigheid van een reeks zeventiende-eeuwse genrevoorstellingen'· dbnl |first=| last=DBNL| date=| website=DBNL |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[merry company]]'' showed a group of figures at a party, whether making music at home or just drinking in a tavern. Other common types of scenes showed markets or fairs, village festivities ("kermesse"), or soldiers in camp.

[[File:Jean-Baptiste Greuze - Filial Piety - WGA10664.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]], ''Filial Piety'', 1765]]

In Italy, a "school" of genre painting was stimulated by the arrival in [[Rome]] of the Dutch painter [[Pieter van Laer]] in 1625. He acquired the nickname "Il Bamboccio" and his followers were called the ''[[Bamboccianti]]'', whose works would inspire [[Giacomo Ceruti]], [[Antonio Cifrondi]], and [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]] among many others.

[[Le Nain|Louis le Nain]] was an important exponent of genre painting in 17th-century France, painting groups of peasants at home, where the 18th century would bring a heightened interest in the depiction of everyday life, whether through the [[romanticism|romanticized]] paintings of [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]], or the careful [[realism (arts)|realism]] of [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin|Chardin]]. [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (1725–1805) and others painted detailed and rather sentimental groups or individual portraits of peasants that were to be influential on 19th-century painting.

In England, [[William Hogarth]] (1697–1764) conveyed comedy, social criticism and moral lessons through canvases that told stories of ordinary people ful of narrative detail (aided by long sub-titles), often in serial form, as in his ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', first painted in 1732–33, then engraved and published in print form in 1735.

Spain had a tradition predating ''[[The Book of Good Love]]'' of social observation and commentary based on the Old Roman Latin tradition, practiced by many of its painters and [[illuminated manuscript|illuminators]].  At the height of the Spanish Empire and the beginning of its slow decline, many [[picaresque]] genre scenes of street life—as well as the kitchen scenes known as ''[[bodegones]]''—were painted by the artists of The [[Spanish Golden Age]], notably [[Velázquez]] (1599–1660) and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] (1617–82). More than a century later, the Spanish artist [[Francisco de Goya]] (1746–1828) used genre scenes in painting and [[printmaking]] as a medium for dark commentary on the human condition. His ''[[The Disasters of War]]'', a series of 82 genre incidents from the [[Peninsular War]], took genre art to unprecedented heights of expressiveness.

==19th century==
[[File:Wassilij Grigorjewitsch Perow 004.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Vasily Perov]], ''The Hunters at Rest'' (1871), [[Tretyakov Gallery]]]]

[[File:1820-Country-Wedding-John-Lewis-Krimmel.jpg|thumb|280px|[[John Lewis Krimmel]], ''Country Wedding'' (1820)]]

With the decline of religious and historical painting in the 19th century, artists increasingly found their subject matter in the life around them. [[Realism (art)|Realists]] such as [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819–77) upset expectations by depicting everyday scenes in huge paintings—at the scale traditionally reserved for "important" subjects—thus blurring the boundary which had set genre painting apart as a "minor" category. Realist paintings on such a scale, and the new type showing people at work, emphasizing the effort involved, would not normally be called "genre paintings".  Both monumental scale and the depiction of exhausting work are exemplified by ''[[Barge Haulers on the Volga]]'' ([[Ilya Repin]], 1873). [[History painting]] itself shifted from the exclusive depiction of events of great public importance to the depiction of genre scenes in historical times, both the private moments of great figures, and the everyday life of ordinary people. In French art this was known as the [[Troubador style]].  This trend, already apparent by 1817 when [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] painted ''Henri IV Playing with His Children'', culminated in the [[pompier]] art of French academicians such as [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904) and [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]] (1815–91).  In the second half of the century interest in genre scenes, often in historical settings or with pointed social or moral comment, greatly increased across Europe.

[[William Powell Frith]] (1819–1909) was perhaps the most famous English genre painter of the Victorian era, painting large and extremely crowded scenes; the expansion in size and ambition in 19th-century genre painting was a common trend. Other 19th-century English genre painters include [[Augustus Leopold Egg]], [[Frederick Daniel Hardy]], [[George Elgar Hicks]], [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[John Everett Millais]].  Scotland produced two influential genre painters, [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]] (1744–96) and [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] (1785–1841). Wilkie's ''The Cottar's Saturday Night'' (1837) inspired a major work by the French painter [[Gustave Courbet]], ''[[After Dinner at Ornans]]'' (1849). Famous [[Russia]]n realist painters like [[Vasily Perov]] and [[Ilya Repin]] also produced genre paintings.

In Germany, [[Carl Spitzweg]] (1808–85) specialized in gently humorous genre scenes, and in Italy [[Gerolamo Induno]] (1825–90) painted scenes of military life. Subsequently, the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], as well as such 20th-century artists as [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Itshak Holtz]], [[Edward Hopper]], and [[David Park (painter)|David Park]] painted scenes of daily life. But in the context of modern art the term "genre painting" has come to be associated mainly with painting of an especially anecdotal or sentimental nature, painted in a traditionally realistic technique.

The first true genre painter in the United States was the German immigrant [[John Lewis Krimmel]], who learning from Wilkie and Hogarth, produced gently humorous scenes of life in Philadelphia from 1812–21. Other notable 19th-century genre painters from the United States include [[George Caleb Bingham]], [[William Sidney Mount]], and [[Eastman Johnson]]. [[Harry Roseland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safran-arts.com/42day/art/art4may/art0512.html|title=ART / 4 / 2DAY|first=John F.|last=Canu|date=|website=www.safran-arts.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on scenes of poor African Americans in the post-American Civil War South,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/158/5/970.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Rogers (sculptor)|John Rogers]] (1829–1904) was a sculptor whose small genre works, mass-produced in cast plaster, were immensely popular in America.  The works of American painter [[Ernie Barnes]] (1938–2009) and those of illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]] (1894–1978) could exemplify a more modern type of genre painting.

[[File:Deutsches Musikarchiv der Deutschen Nationalbibliothek.jpg|thumb|Reading room of the German Music Archive in Leipzig]]
The '''German Music Archive''' (in German: '''Deutsches Musikarchiv''', ''DMA'') is the central collection of [[sheet music|printed]] and [[gramophone record|recorded music]] and the music-bibliographic information centre for [[Germany]]. It is a Federal agency founded in 1970, tasked with collecting all music published in the country. Publishers of printed and recorded music in Germany are required by law (since 1973) to deliver two copies of every edition as [[legal deposit]]s to the archive.

The DMA constitutes a department of the [[German National Library]] (''Deutsche Nationalbibliothek''). Since 2010 it is located in [[Leipzig]] at the national library.

== History ==
[[Image:Berlin musikarchiv.jpg|thumb|Former host building: The ''Siemens-Villa'' in Berlin-Lankwitz]]

The archive was founded in [[West Berlin]] on January 1, 1970, during the [[History of Germany (1945–90)|division of Germany]] as a department of [[Frankfurt am Main]] based ''Deutsche Bibliothek''—the national library for [[West Germany]]. It incorporated its precursor, the ''Deutsche Musik-Phonothek'' (1961–1969), and was located (until 2010) at the ''Siemens-Villa'' in [[Berlin-Lankwitz]].

In the process of [[German reunification]] the West German ''Deutsche Bibliothek'' and the East German ''Deutsche Bücherei'' formed one national library with two seats in Frankfurt and Leipzig. The DMA moved to Leipzig in 2010, to be housed in an extension of the ''Deutsche Nationalbibliothek''. Construction work began in 2006 and was completed in 2009.

In July 2000, the DMA also assumed the role as repository for [[GEMA (Germany)|GEMA]], ''Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte,'' a German music copyright organization. Since then, music publishers only have to submit copies to DMA, which covers both national archiving and copyright registration. The 210,000 works of printed music previously held by GEMA were transferred to DMA.

The '''Hawaiian Potters Guild''' produced handmade [[Ceramic glaze|glazed]] [[earthenware]] ceramics in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] in the 1930s and 1940s.

==Origins==
In 1931, Sarah Wilder (Mrs. James A. Wilder), wife of the painter [[James Austin Wilder]], began offering pottery courses at the [[Honolulu Museum of Art]]. These classes were expanded about 1937 by Mrs. Nancy Andrew, which led to the formation of the Hawaiian Potters Guild.  The Guild remained active into the 1940s.

Its output was mostly functional and based upon plants found in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Severson, Don R. ''Finding Paradise: Island Art in Private Collections'', University of Hawaii Press, 2002, p 284&lt;/ref&gt; The guild also produced purely decorative pieces, such as the platter in shape of taro leaf with guava branch (illustrated), which was made for the luxury retailer [[Gump's|S. &amp; G. Gump and Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Label in display case, Honolulu Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Hawaiian Potters Guild should not be confused with the [[Hawaii Potters’ Guild]], which was founded in 1967 and continues today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaiipottersguild.org/ Hawaii Potters’ Guild website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Institut Lumière - CINEMATOGRAPHE Camera.jpg|thumb|Cinématographe Lumière at the [[Institut Lumière]] in [[Lyon]], [[France]] ]]
{{Years in film}}
Although the start of the '''history of film''' is not clearly defined, the commercial, public screening of ten of [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]]' short films in Paris on 28 December 1895 can be regarded as the breakthrough of projected [[cinematography|cinematographic]] motion pictures. There had been earlier cinematographic results and screenings but these lacked either the quality or the momentum that propelled the cinématographe Lumière into a worldwide success.

Soon film production companies were established all over the world. The first decade of motion picture saw film moving from a novelty to an established mass entertainment industry.

The earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long and without recorded sound.

During the 1890s films became several minutes long and started to consist of several shots. The first film studios were built in 1897. The first rotating camera for taking [[panning (camera)|panning shots]] was built in 1898. Special effects were introduced and film continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, began to be used.

In the 1900s, continuity of action across successive shots was achieved and the first close-up shot was introduced (some claim [[D. W. Griffith]] was the inventor). Most films of this period were what came to be called "chase films". The first successful permanent theatre showing only films was "The Nickelodeon" in Pittsburgh in 1905. The first feature length multi-reel film was a 1906 Australian production. By 1910, actors began to receive screen credit for their roles, opening the way for the creation of film stars. Regular newsreels were exhibited from 1910 and soon became a popular way for finding out the news. From about 1910, American films had the largest share of the market in Australia and in all European countries except France.

New film techniques were introduced in this period including the use of artificial lighting, fire effects and [[low-key lighting]] (i.e. lighting in which most of the frame is dark) for enhanced atmosphere during sinister scenes. As films grew longer, specialist writers were employed to simplify more complex stories derived from novels or plays into a form that could be contained on one reel and be easier to be understood by the audience{{snd}} an audience that was new to this form of storytelling. [[Genres]] began to be used as categories; the main division was into comedy and drama but these categories were further subdivided. During the [[First World War]] there was a complex transition for the film industry. The exhibition of films changed from short one-reel programs to feature films. Exhibition venues became larger and began charging higher prices. By 1914, continuity cinema was the established mode of commercial cinema. One of the advanced continuity techniques involved an accurate and smooth transition from one shot to another.

[[David Wark Griffith|D. W. Griffith]] had the highest standing among American directors in the industry, because of the dramatic excitement he conveyed to the audience through his films. The American film industry, or "[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]", as it was becoming known after its new geographical center in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood, a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California]], gained the position it has held, more or less, ever since: film factory for the world and exporting its product to most countries. By the 1920s, the United States reached what is still its era of greatest-ever output, producing an average of 800 ''feature'' films annually,&lt;ref name="filmsite.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/20sintro.html|title=Film History of the 1920s|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 82% of the global total (Eyman, 1997).  During late 1927, Warner's released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', with the first synchronized dialogue (and singing) in a feature film. By the end of 1929, Hollywood was almost all-talkie, with several competing sound systems (soon to be standardized). Sound saved the Hollywood studio system in the face of the [[Great Depression]] (Parkinson, 1995).

The desire for wartime propaganda created a renaissance in the film industry in Britain, with realistic war dramas. The onset of American involvement in World War II also brought a proliferation of films as both [[patriotism]] and [[propaganda]]. The [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] investigated Hollywood in the early 1950s. During the immediate post-war years the cinematic industry was also threatened by [[television]] and the increasing popularity of the medium meant that some film theatres would bankrupt and close. The 1950s was considered a "Golden Age" for non-English [[world cinema|cinema]].

''[[Roundhay Garden Scene]]'' is an 1888 [[short film|short]] [[silent film]] recorded by French inventor [[Louis Le Prince]]. It is believed to be the [[History of Film|oldest surviving film]] in existence, as noted by the [[Guinness World Records|''Guinness Book of Records'']].&lt;ref&gt;[[Guinness World Records|''Guinness Book of Records'']], all editions.&lt;/ref&gt;
The film ''[[Sortie de l'usine Lumière de Lyon]]'' (1895) by French [[Louis Lumière]] is considered the "first true motion picture".&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573634/Lumi%C3%A8re.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080125065813/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573634/Lumi%C3%A8re.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-01-25 |title=Lumière |work=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007 | accessdate=2007-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precursors==
{{Main|Precursors of film}}
[[Film]] as an art form has drawn on several earlier traditions in the fields such as (oral) [[storytelling]], [[literature]], [[theatre]] and [[visual art]]s. Forms of art and entertainment that had already featured moving and/or projected images include:
* [[Shadowgraphy (performing art)|shadowgraphy]], probably used since prehistoric times
* [[camera obscura]], a natural phenomenon that has possibly been used as an artistic aid since prehistoric times
* [[Shadow play|shadow puppetry]], possibly originated around 200 BCE in Central Asia, India, Indonesia or China
* [[magic lantern]], developed in the 1650s, preceded by some incidental and/or inferior [[projector]]s
* [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] "[[persistence of vision]]" animation devices ([[phenakistiscope|phénakisticope]] since 1832, [[zoetrope]] since 1866, [[flip book]] since 1868)

Some ancient sightings of gods and spirits may have been conjured up by means of (concave) mirrors, camera obscura or unknown projectors. By the 16th century [[necromancy|necromantic]] ceremonies and the conjuring of ghostly apparitions by charlatan "magicians" and "witches" seemed commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=BIL2BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage|title=Ghost Images: Cinema of the Afterlife|last=Ruffles|first=Tom|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very first magic lantern shows seem to have continued this tradition with images of death, monsters and other scary figures. Around 1790 this was developed into multi-media ghost shows known as [[phantasmagoria]] that could feature mechanical slides, rear projection, mobile projectors, [[superimposition]], [[dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolves]], live actors, smoke (sometimes to project images upon), odors, sounds and even electric shocks. While the first magic lantern images seem to have been intended to scare audiences, soon all sorts of subjects appeared and the lantern was not only used for storytelling but also for education. In the 19th century several new and popular magic lantern techniques were developed, including [[dissolving views]] and several types of mechanical slides that created dazzling abstract effects (chromatrope, etc.) or that showed for instance falling snow, or the planets and their moons revolving.

==Early period==
{{Main|Silent film|Sound film}}
[[File:Kinetoscope.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Interior view of [[Kinetoscope]] with peephole viewer at top of cabinet.]]
In the 1890s, films were seen mostly via temporary storefront spaces and traveling exhibitors or as acts in vaudeville programs. A film could be under a minute long and would usually present a single scene, authentic or staged, of everyday life, a public event, a sporting event or [[slapstick]]. There was little to no cinematic technique, the film was usually black and white and it was without sound.

[[File:Fratelli_Lumiere.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière]]
The novelty of realistic moving photographs was enough for a motion picture industry to blossom before the end of the century, in countries around the world. "The Cinema" was to offer a cheaper, simpler way of providing entertainment to the masses. Filmmakers could record actors' performances, which then could be shown to audiences around the world. Travelogues would bring the sights of far-flung places, with movement, directly to spectators' hometowns. Movies would become the most popular visual art form of the late Victorian age.&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell, David and Thompson, Kristin. (2003) ''Film History An Introduction''. New York: McGraw-Hill Company Inc.p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre|Berlin Wintergarten theater]] hosted an early movie presentation in front of an audience, shown by the [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky brothers]] in 1895. The [[Melbourne Athenaeum]] started to screen movies in 1896. [[Movie theater]]s became popular entertainment venues and social hubs in the early 20th century, much like [[cabaret]]s and other theaters.

[[File:Le Voyage dans la lune.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'' (1902) by [[Georges Méliès]].]]
Until 1927, motion pictures were produced without sound. This era is referred to as the [[Silent film|silent era of film]]. To enhance the viewers' experience, silent films were commonly accompanied by live musicians in an orchestra, a theatre organ, and sometimes [[sound effect]]s and even commentary spoken by the showman or projectionist. In most countries, [[intertitle]]s came to be used to provide dialogue and narration for the film, thus dispensing with narrators, but in Japanese cinema human narration remained popular throughout the silent era. The technical problems were resolved by 1923.

[[Illustrated song]]s were a notable exception to this trend that began in 1894 in [[vaudeville]] houses and persisted as late as the late 1930s in film theaters.&lt;ref name="The House of Witmark"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The House of Witmark| last=Witmark| first=Isidore|author2=Goldberg, Isaac| year=1939| page=116| publisher=New York OOO| location=New York| id=ASIN B001DZ8MP6|isbn=0-306-70686-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Live performance or sound recordings were paired with hand-colored glass [[Magic lantern (projector)|slides]] projected through [[stereopticon]]s and similar devices. In this way, song narrative was illustrated through a series of slides whose changes were simultaneous with the narrative development. The main purpose of illustrated songs was to encourage [[sheet music]] sales, and they were highly successful with sales reaching into the millions for a single song. Later, with the birth of film, illustrated songs were used as filler material preceding films and during [[Film reel|reel changes]].&lt;ref name="The Sounds of Early Cinema ch. 14"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Abel| first=Richard| chapter=That Most American of Attractions, The Illustrated Song| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wADgG_d-PSAC&amp;pg=PA143| title=The Sounds of Early Cinema| editor1-last=Abel| editor1-first=Richard| editor2-first=Rick| editor2-last=Altman| year=2001| pages=143–153| publisher=Indiana University Press| isbn=0-253-33988-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1914 ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]'' was a non-commercial attempt to combine the motion picture with a combination of slides and synchronize the resulting moving picture with audio. The film included hand-painted slides as well as other previously used techniques. Simultaneously playing the audio while the film was being played with a projector was required. Produced by the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania]] (Jehovah's Witnesses), this eight–hour bible drama was being shown in 80 cities every day and almost eight million people in the United States and Canada saw the presentation.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of American Religion and Politics'' {{ISBN|978-1-438-13020-0}} p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth of movies ==
Within eleven years of motion pictures, the films moved from a novelty show to an established large-scale entertainment industry. Films moved from a single shot, completely made by one person with a few assistants, towards films several minutes long consisting of several shots, which were made by large companies in something like industrial conditions.

By 1900, the first motion pictures that can be considered as "films"{{snd}} emerged, and film-makers began to introduce basic editing techniques and film narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wichm.home.xs4all.nl/myth.html|title=The genesis of cinematography distinguishes two dates: in 1888 the technology became available and from 1900 onwards film language developed.|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Invention and advancement of the camera ===
[[Image:Melstud2.gif|thumb|200px|[[Georges Méliès]] (left) painting a backdrop in his studio.]]
Early movie cameras were fastened to the head of a tripod with only simple levelling devices provided. These cameras were effectively fixed during the course of a shot, and the first camera movements were the result of mounting a camera on a moving vehicle. The [[Lumière brothers]] shot a scene from the back of a train in 1896.

The first rotating camera for taking [[panning (camera)|panning shots]] was built by [[Robert W. Paul]] in 1897, on the occasion of [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]]. He used his camera to shoot the procession in one shot. His device had the camera mounted on a vertical axis that could be rotated by a [[worm gear]] driven by turning a crank handle, and Paul put it on general sale the next year. Shots taken using such a "panning" head were also referred to as 'panoramas' in the film catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalmediamuseumblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/robert-w-paul-cinematograph-camera-30th-birthday-countdown/|title=The cine camera which began the National Cinematography Collection|publisher=National Media Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georges Méliès]] built one of the first film studios in May 1897. It had a glass roof and three glass walls constructed after the model of large studios for still photography, and it was fitted with thin cotton cloths that could be stretched below the roof to diffuse the direct rays of the sun on sunny days.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, John. ''World Film Directors'', Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. pp. 747–765.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1896, Méliès would go on to produce, direct, and distribute over 500 short films. The majority of these films were short, one-shot films completed in one take. Méliès drew many comparisons between film and the stage, which was apparent in his work. He realized that film afforded him the ability (via his use of time lapse photography) to "produce visual spectacles not achievable in the theater.&lt;ref name="Gazetas, Aristides 2000"&gt;Gazetas, Aristides. ''An Introduction to World Cinema''. Jefferson: McFarland Company, Inc, 2000. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Execution of Mary Stuart]]'', produced by the Edison Company for viewing with the [[Kinetoscope]], showed [[Mary Queen of Scots]] being executed in full view of the camera. The effect was achieved by replacing the actor with a dummy for the final shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lomography.com/magazine/lifestyle/2011/11/04/the-magic-of-early-cinema-the-execution-of-mary-stuart-1895|title=The execution of Mary Stuart 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georges Méliès also utilized this technique in the making of ''Escamotage d'un dame chez Robert-Houdin (The Vanishing Lady)''. The woman is seen to vanish through the use of [[stop motion]] techniques.

[[Image:SantaW1.gif|thumb|left|200px|A scene inset inside a circular vignette showing a "dream vision" in ''Santa Claus'' (1899).]]
The other basic technique for trick cinematography was the [[Multiple exposure|double exposure]] of the film in the camera. This was pioneered by [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]] in July 1898 in England. The set was draped in black, and after the main shot, the negative was re-exposed to the overlaid scene. His ''The Corsican Brothers'' was described in the catalogue of the [[Warwick Trading Company]] in 1900: "By extremely careful photography the ghost appears *quite transparent*. After indicating that he has been killed by a sword-thrust, and appealing for vengeance, he disappears. A 'vision' then appears showing the fatal duel in the snow.”

G.A. Smith also initiated the special effects technique of [[reverse motion]]. He did this by repeating the action a second time, while filming it with an inverted camera, and then joining the tail of the second negative to that of the first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/725468/|title=Santa Claus (1898)|publisher=BFI Screenonline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first films made using this device were ''Tipsy, Topsy, Turvy'' and ''The Awkward Sign Painter''. The earliest surviving example of this technique is Smith's ''[[The House That Jack Built (1900 film)|The House That Jack Built]]'', made before September 1900.

[[Cecil Hepworth]] took this technique further, by printing the [[negative (photography)|negative]] of the forwards motion backwards frame by frame, so producing a print in which the original action was exactly reversed. To do this he built a special printer in which the negative running through a projector was projected into the gate of a camera through a special lens giving a same-size image. This arrangement came to be called a "projection printer", and eventually an "[[optical printer]]".

The use of different camera speeds also appeared around 1900 in the films of [[Robert W. Paul]] and Hepworth. Paul shot scenes from ''On a Runaway Motor Car through Piccadilly Circus'' (1899) with the camera turning very slowly. When the film was projected at the usual 16 frames per second, the scenery appeared to be passing at great speed. Hepworth used the opposite effect in ''The Indian Chief and the [[Seidlitz powder|Seidlitz Powder]]'' (1901). The Chief's movements are sped up by cranking the camera much faster than 16 frames per second. This gives what we would call a "[[slow motion]]" effect.

=== Film editing and continuous narrative ===
The first films to consist of more than one shot appeared toward the end of the 19th century, a notable example was the French film of the life of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], ''La vie du Christ (The Birth, the Life and the Death of Christ)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Guy|first=Alice|title=The Birth, the Life and the Death of Christ|date=January 1907|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139714/|accessdate=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Alice Guy]]. These weren't represented as a continuous film, the separate scenes were interspersed with lantern slides, a lecture, and live choral numbers, to increase the running time of the spectacle to about 90 minutes. Another example of this is the reproductions of scenes from the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish war]], made by [[Georges Méliès]] in 1897. Although each scene was sold separately, they were shown one after the other by the exhibitors. Even Méliès' ''Cendrillon (Cinderella)'' of 1898 contained no action moving from one shot to the next one. To understand what was going on in the film the audience had to know their stories beforehand, or be told them by a presenter.

[[File:Paul3.gif|thumb|center|600px|The two scenes making up ''[[Come Along, Do!]]'']]
Real film continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, is attributed to British film pioneer [[Robert W. Paul]]'s ''[[Come Along, Do!]]'', made in 1898 and one of the first films to feature more than one shot.&lt;ref name="BFIso01"&gt;{{cite web |title=Come Along, Do! |first=Michael |last=Brooke |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444430/ |work=BFI Screenonline Database |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first shot, an elderly couple is outside an [[art exhibition]] having lunch and then follow other people inside through the door. The second shot shows what they do inside. Paul's 'Cinematograph Camera No. 1' of 1895 was the first camera to feature reverse-cranking, which allowed the same film footage to be exposed several times and thereby to create super-positions and [[multiple exposure]]s. This technique was first used in his 1901 film ''[[Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost]]''.

The further development of action continuity in multi-shot films continued in 1899 at the [[Brighton]] School in [[England]]. In the latter part of that year, [[George Albert Smith (inventor)|George Albert Smith]] made ''The Kiss in the Tunnel''. This started with a shot from a "phantom ride" at the point at which the train goes into a tunnel, and continued with the action on a set representing the interior of a railway carriage, where a man steals a kiss from a woman, and then cuts back to the phantom ride shot when the train comes out of the tunnel. A month later, the Bamforth company in Yorkshire made a restaged version of this film under the same title, and in this case they filmed shots of a train entering and leaving a tunnel from beside the tracks, which they joined before and after their version of the kiss inside the train compartment.

[[File:Telesc4.gif|thumb|center|600px|The first two shots of ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'' (1900), with the telescope POV simulated by the circular mask.]]
In 1900, continuity of action across successive shots was definitively established by George Albert Smith and [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]], who also worked in [[Brighton]]. In that year Smith made ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'', in which the main shot shows street scene with a young man tying the shoelace and then caressing the foot of his girlfriend, while an old man observes this through a telescope. There is then a cut to close shot of the hands on the girl's foot shown inside a black circular mask, and then a cut back to the continuation of the original scene. Even more remarkable is [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]]'s ''Attack on a China Mission Station'' (1900). The first shot shows Chinese Boxer rebels at the gate; it then cuts to the missionary family in the garden, where a fight ensues. The wife signals to British sailors from the [[balcony]], who come and rescue them. The film also used the first "reverse angle" cut in film history.

G.A Smith pioneered the use of the close-up shot in his 1900 films ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'' and ''[[Grandma's Reading Glass]]''. He further developed the ideas of breaking a scene shot in one place into a series of shots taken from different camera positions over the next couple of years, starting with ''The Little Doctors'' of 1901. In a series of films he produced at this time, he also introduced the use of subjective and objective point-of-view shots, the creation of dream-time and the use of reversing. He summed up his work in ''Mary Jane's Mishap'' of 1903, with repeated cuts in to a close shot of a housemaid fooling around, along with superimpositions and other devices, before abandoning film-making to invent the Kinemacolor system of colour cinematography. His films were the first to establish the basics of coherent narrative and what became known as film language, or "[[film grammar]]".&lt;ref name="BFIso001"&gt;{{cite web |title=As Seen Through a Telescope |first=Michael |last=Brooke |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444530/ |work=BFI Screenonline Database |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BF01"&gt;{{cite web|title=As Seen Through a Telescope |first=David |last=Fisher |url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/brighton/brighton_films_telescope.htm |work=Brightonfilm.com |accessdate=2011-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322002732/http://www.terramedia.co.uk/brighton/brighton_films_telescope.htm |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Williamson concentrated on making films taking action from one place shown in one shot to the next shown in another shot in films like ''Stop Thief!'', made in 1901, and many others. He also experimented with the close-up, and made perhaps the most extreme one of all in ''[[The Big Swallow]]'', when his character approaches the camera and appears to swallow it. These two film makers of the Brighton School also pioneered the editing of the film; they tinted their work with color and used trick photography to enhance the narrative. By 1900, their films were extended scenes of up to 5 minutes long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Most films of this period were what came to be called "chase films". These were inspired by [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]]'s ''[[Stop Thief!]]'' of 1901, which showed a tramp stealing a leg of mutton from a butcher's boy in the first shot, then being chased through the second shot by the butcher's boy and assorted dogs, and finally being caught by the dogs in the third shot. Several British films made in the first half of 1903 extended the chase method of film construction. These included ''An Elopement à la Mode'' and ''The Pickpocket: A Chase Through London'', made by Alf Collins for the British branch of the French [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont company]], ''Daring Daylight Burglary'', made by [[Frank Mottershaw]] at the Sheffield Photographic Company, and ''[[Desperate Poaching Affray]]'', made by [[William Haggar]]. Haggar in particular innovated the first extant panning shots; the [[poaching|poachers]] are chased by gamekeepers and police officers and the camera pans along, creating a sense of urgency and speed.&lt;ref name="Affray"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444205/ | title=Desperate Poaching Affray (1903) | work=[[British Film Institute]] | author= | accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His films were also recognised for their intelligent use of depth of staging and screen edges, while film academic [[Noël Burch]] praised Haggar's effective use of off-screen space.&lt;ref name="BFI"&gt;Hayes, Christian.  [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1193042/ Phantom Rides], [[British Film Institute|BFI Screen Online]].  Accessed 30 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also one of the first film makers to purposefully introduce violence for entertainment; in ''Desperate Poaching Affray'' the villains are seen firing guns at their pursuers.

[[Image:The Great Train Robbery 0018.jpg|thumb|left|Still from ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', produced by [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]].]]
Other filmmakers took up all these ideas including the American [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]], who started making films for the Edison Company in 1901. Porter, a projectionist, was hired by Thomas Edison to develop his new projection model known as the [[Vitascope]]. Porter wanted to develop a style of filmmaking that would move away from the one-shot short films into a "story-telling [narrative]" style.&lt;ref name="Gazetas, Aristides 2000"/&gt; When he began making longer films in 1902, he put a dissolve between every shot, just as Georges Méliès was already doing, and he frequently had the same action repeated across the dissolves. His film, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), had a running time of twelve minutes, with twenty separate shots and ten different indoor and outdoor locations. He used [[cross-cutting]] [[film editing|editing]] method to show simultaneous action in different places. The time continuity in ''The Great Train Robbery'' was actually more confusing than that in the films it was modeled on, but nevertheless it was a greater success than them due to its [[American Old West|Wild West]] violence. ''The Great Train Robbery'' served as one of the vehicles that would launch the film medium into mass popularity.&lt;ref name="Gazetas, Aristides 2000"/&gt;

The Pathé company in France also made imitations and variations of Smith and Williamson's films from 1902 onwards using cuts between the shots, which helped to standardize the basics of film construction. An influential French film of the period was Méliès's 14-minute-long ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''.&lt;ref name=Hammond&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Paul|title=Marvellous Méliès|year=1974|publisher=Gordon Fraser|location=London|isbn=0900406380|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was extremely popular at the time of its release, and is the best-known of the hundreds of films made by Méliès. It was one of the first known [[science fiction film]]s, and used innovative [[animation]] and [[special effects]], including the well-known image of the spaceship landing in the Moon's eye. The sheer volume of Pathé's production led to their filmmakers giving a further precision and polish to the details of film continuity.

=== Animation ===
The first use of animation in movies was in 1899, with the production of the short film Matches: An Appeal by British film pioneer [[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]]- a thirty-second long stop-motion animated piece intended to encourage the audience to send matches to British troops fighting the [[Boer War]]. The film contains an appeal to send money to [[Bryant and May]] who would then send matches to the troops fighting in South Africa. It was shown in December 1899 at The Empire Theatre in London. This film is the earliest known example of stop-motion animation. Little puppets, constructed of matchsticks, are writing the appeal on a black wall. Their movements are filmed frame by frame, movement by movement.

[[File:Humorous Phases of Funny Faces screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|A single frame from the ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' animation, showing the use of [[cutout animation|cut-out]] technique]]
The relative sophistication of this piece was not followed up for some time, with subsequent works in animation being limited to short, two or three frame effects, such as appeared in [[Edwin Stanton Porter]]'s 1902 short ''Fun in a Bakery Shop'', where a lump of dough was made to smile over the course of a three-frame sequence. Works rivaling the British short in length did not appear until 1905, when Edwin Porter made ''How Jones Lost His Roll'', and ''The Whole Dam Family and the Dam Dog''. Both of these films had intertitles which were formed by the letters moving into place from a random scattering to form the words of the titles. This was done by exposing the film one frame at a time, and moving the letters a little bit towards their final position between each exposure. This is what has come to be called "single frame [[animation]]" or "object animation", and it needs a slightly adapted camera that exposes only one frame for each turn of the crank handle, rather than the usual eight frames per turn.

[[File:Dartagnan-musketeers.jpg|thumb|right|210px|[[Ernst Lubitsch]] known as the master of kostumfilme]]
In 1906, [[Albert E. Smith (producer)|Albert Edward Smith]] and [[J. Stuart Blackton|James Stuart Blackton]] at [[Vitagraph Studios]] took the next step, and in their ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'',&lt;ref name="Beckerman2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beckerman|first=Howard|title=Animation: the whole story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjW6cCE4v1QC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=16 August 2011|date=2003-09-01|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|isbn=978-1-58115-301-9|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; what appear to be cartoon drawings of people move from one pose to another. This is done for most of the length of this film by moving jointed cut-outs of the figures frame by frame between the exposures, just as Porter moved his letters. However, there is a very short section of the film where things are made to appear to move by altering the drawings themselves from frame to frame, which is how [[traditional animation|standard animated cartoons]] have since been made up to today.

[[File:Quirino Cristiani con una figura.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''[[El Apóstol]]'', the world's first animated feature film, and ''[[Peludópolis]]'', the first animated feature film with sound, were produced in cutout animation by Italian-born cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]].{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=49}}]]

The technique of single frame animation was further developed in 1907 by Edwin S. Porter in ''The Teddy Bears'' and by J. Stuart Blackton with ''Work Made Easy''. In the first of these the toy bears were made to move, apparently on their own, and in the latter film building tools were made to perform construction tasks without human intervention, by using frame-by-frame animation. The technique got to Europe almost immediately, and Segundo de Chomon and others at Pathé took it further, adding [[clay animation]], in which sculptures were deformed from one thing into another thing frame by frame in ''Sculpture moderne'' (1908), and then Pathé made the next step to the animation of silhouette shapes. Also in France, [[Émile Cohl]] fully developed drawn animation in a series of films starting with ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908), in which humans and objects drawn as outline figures went through a series of remarkable interactions and transformations. In the United States the response was from the famous strip [[Cartoonist|cartoon artist]] [[Winsor McCay]], who drew much more realistic animated figures going through smoother, more naturalistic motion in a series of films starting with the film ''Little Nemo'', made for Vitagraph in 1911. In the next few years various others took part in this development of [[animated cartoon]]s in the United States and elsewhere.

The world's first animated feature film was ''[[El Apóstol]]'' (1917), made by Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] utilizing cutout animation.{{sfn|Finkielman|2004}}{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=378}} Cristiani also directed the first animated feature film with sound, ''[[Peludópolis]]'', released with a vitaphone sound-on-disc synchronization system soundtrack. Unfortunately, a fire that destroyed producer Federico Valle's film studio incinerated the only known copies of the movies, and they are now considered as lost films.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=25}}{{sfn|Bendazzi|1996}}

In 1932, the first short animated film created entirely with [[technicolor]] (the trichromatic procedure (green, red, blue), whose use required a triple photographic impression, incorporation of chromatic filters and cameras of enormous dimensions) was [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'', directed by [[Burt Gillett]].&lt;ref name="esquire1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.esquire.com/es/actualidad/cine/a10335017/primera-pelicula-color/|title=¿Cuál fue la primera película en color?|date=2017-08-02|work=Esquire|access-date=2017-12-07|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feature film ===

[[File:Hollywood_Sign_(Zuschnitt).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Hollywood Sign]]]]
Films at the time were no longer than one reel, although some multi-reel films had been made on the life of Christ in the first few years of cinema. The first feature length multi-reel film in the world was the 1906 Australian production called ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=37899&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Return of the Kelly Gang|journal= The [[UNESCO Courier]]|issn=1993-8616|issue=2007 #5|last=Chichester|first=Jo|publisher=[[UNESCO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It traced the life of the legendary infamous [[outlaw]] and [[bushranger]] [[Ned Kelly]] (1855–1880) and ran for more than an hour with a reel length of approximately 4,000 feet (1,200 m).&lt;ref name=R&amp;P&gt;Ray Edmondson and Andrew Pike (1982) ''Australia's Lost Films.''

===Film business===
[[File:Biograph poster2.jpg|left|thumb|Poster for a [[Biograph Studios]] release from 1913.]]
The first successful permanent theatre showing only films was "The Nickelodeon", which was opened in Pittsburgh in 1905. By then there were enough films several minutes long available to fill a programme running for at least half an hour, and which could be changed weekly when the local audience became bored with it. Other exhibitors in the United States quickly followed suit, and within a couple of years there were thousands of these [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]]s in operation. The American experience led to a worldwide boom in the production and exhibition of films from 1906 onwards.

By 1907 purpose-built cinemas for motion pictures were being opened across the United States, Britain and France. The films were often shown with the accompaniment of music provided by a pianist, though there could be more musicians. There were also a very few larger cinemas in some of the biggest cities. Initially, the majority of films in the programmes were [[Pathé]] films, but this changed fairly quickly as the American companies cranked up production. The programme was made up of just a few films, and the show lasted around 30 minutes. The reel of film, of maximum length {{convert|1000|ft|m}}, which usually contained one individual film, became the standard unit of film production and exhibition in this period. The programme was changed twice or more a week, but went up to five changes of programme a week after a couple of years. In general, cinemas were set up in the established entertainment districts of the cities. In 1907, Pathé began renting their films to cinemas through film exchanges rather than selling the films outright.

By about 1910, actors began to receive screen credit for their roles, and the way to the creation of film stars was opened. Films were increasingly longer, and began to feature proper plots and development.

The litigation over patents between all the major American film-making companies led to the formation of a trust to control the American film business, with each company in the trust being allocated production quotas (two reels a week for the biggest ones, one reel a week for the smaller). However, although 6,000 exhibitors signed up to the trust, about 2,000 others did not and began to fund new film producing companies. By 1912 the independents had nearly half of the market and the government defeated the trust by initiating [[Antitrust|anti-trust]] action at the same time.

In the early 20th century, before [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], the motion picture industry was based in [[America's first motion picture industry|Fort Lee, New Jersey]] across the Hudson River from New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Kannapell, Andrea.

Accessed December 7, 2013. "Back in 1912, when Hollywood had more cattle than cameras, Fort Lee was the center of the cinematic universe. Icons from the silent era like Mary Pickford, Lionel Barrymore and Lillian Gish crossed the Hudson River via ferry to emote on Fort Lee back lots."&lt;/ref&gt; In need of a winter headquarters, moviemakers were attracted to [[Jacksonville, Florida]] due to its warm climate, exotic locations, excellent rail access, and cheaper labor, earning the city the title of "The Winter Film Capital of the World." New York-based [[Kalem Studios]] was the first to open a permanent studio in Jacksonville in 1908. Over the course of the next decade, more than 30 silent film companies established studios in town, including [[Metro Pictures]] (later [[MGM]]), [[Edison Studios]], Majestic Films, King Bee Film Company, [[Vim Comedy Company]], [[Norman Studios]], [[Gaumont Studios]] and the [[Lubin Manufacturing Company]]. Comedic actor and Georgia native [[Oliver Hardy|Oliver "Babe" Hardy]] began his motion picture career here in 1914. He starred in over 36 short silent films his first year acting. With the closing of Lubin in early 1915, Oliver moved to New York then New Jersey to find film jobs. Acquiring a job with the Vim Company in early 1915, he returned to [[Jacksonville]] in the spring of 1917 before relocating to Los Angeles in October 1917. The first motion picture made in [[Technicolor]] and the first feature-length color movie produced in the United States, [[The Gulf Between]], was also filmed on location in Jacksonville in 1917.

Jacksonville was especially important to the [[African-American art|African American film]] industry. One notable individual in this regard is the European American producer Richard Norman, who created a string of films starring black actors in the vein of [[Oscar Micheaux]] and the [[Lincoln Motion Picture Company]]. In contrast to the degrading parts offered in certain white films such as [[The Birth of a Nation]], Norman and his contemporaries sought to create positive stories featuring African Americans in what he termed "splendidly assuming different roles."

Jacksonville's mostly conservative residents, however, objected to the hallmarks of the early movie industry, such as car chases in the streets, simulated bank robberies and fire alarms in public places, and even the occasional riot. In 1917, conservative Democrat [[John W. Martin]] was elected mayor on the platform of taming the city's movie industry. By that time, southern [[California]] was emerging as the major movie production center, thanks in large part to the move of film pioneers like [[William Selig]] and [[D.W. Griffith]] to the area. These factors quickly sealed the demise of Jacksonville as a major film destination.

Another factor for the industry's move west was that up until 1913, most American film production was still carried out around New York, but due to the monopoly of [[Thomas A. Edison, Inc.]]'s film patents and its litigious attempts to preserve it, many filmmakers moved to Southern California, starting with [[William Nicholas Selig|Selig]] in 1909. The sunshine and scenery was important for the production of Westerns, which came to form a major American film genre with the first cowboy stars, [[Broncho Billy Anderson|G.M. Anderson ("Broncho Billy")]] and [[Tom Mix]]. Selig pioneered the use of (fairly) wild animals from a zoo for a series of exotic adventures, with the actors being menaced or saved by the animals. [[Kalem Company]] sent film crews to places in America and abroad to film stories in the actual places they were supposed to have happened. Kalem also pioneered the female action heroine from 1912, with [[Ruth Roland]] playing starring roles in their Westerns.

In France, Pathé retained its dominant position, followed still by Gaumont, and then other new companies that appeared to cater to the film boom. A film company with a different approach was Film d'Art. This was set up at the beginning of 1908 to make films of a serious artistic nature. Their declared programme was to make films using only the best dramatists, artists and actors. The first of these was ''[[The Assassination of the Duke of Guise|L'Assassinat du Duc de Guise]]'' (''The Assassination of the Duc de Guise''), a historical subject set in the court of [[Henry III of France|Henri III]]. This film used leading actors from the [[Comédie-Française]], and had a special accompanying score written by [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]. The other French majors followed suit, and this wave gave rise to the English-language description of films with artistic pretensions aimed at a sophisticated audience as [[art film|"art films"]]. By 1910, the French film companies were starting to make films as long as two, or even three reels, though most were still one reel long. This trend was followed in Italy, Denmark, and Sweden.

In Britain, the [[Cinematograph Act 1909]] was the first [[primary legislation]] to specifically regulate the [[film industry]]. [[Cinematograph|Film exhibitions]] often took place in temporary venues and the use of highly flammable [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] for film, combined with [[limelight]] illumination, created a significant fire hazard. The Act specified a strict building code which required, amongst other things, that the projector be enclosed within a fire resisting enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Gardiner | first1 = Juliet | title = The Thirties – an Intimate History | chapter = Prologue | publisher = Harper Press | year = 2010 | location = London | page = 8 | isbn = 978-0-00-724076-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular newsreels were exhibited from 1910 and soon became a popular way for finding out the news{{snd}} the [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1910–13|British Antarctic Expedition]] to the [[South Pole]] was filmed for the newsreels as were the [[suffragette]] demonstrations that were happening at the same time.

=== New film producing countries ===
With the worldwide film boom, yet more countries now joined Britain, France, Germany and the United States in serious film production. In Italy, production was spread over several centres, with Turin being the first and biggest. There, [[Ambrosio Film|Ambrosio]] was the first company in the field in 1905, and remained the largest in the country through this period. Its most substantial rival was [[Cines]] in Rome, which started producing in 1906. The great strength of the [[Cinema of Italy|Italian industry]] was historical epics, with large casts and massive scenery. As early as 1911, [[Giovanni Pastrone]]'s two-reel ''La Caduta di Troia ([[The Fall of Troy (film)|The Fall of Troy]])'' made a big impression worldwide, and it was followed by even bigger glasses like ''[[Quo Vadis?]]'' (1912), which ran for 90 minutes, and Pastrone's ''[[Cabiria]]'' of 1914, which ran for two and a half hours.

[[File:cadutaW1.gif|thumb|300px|''La Caduta di Troia ([[The Fall of Troy (film)|The Fall of Troy]])'' (1911).]]
Italian companies also had a strong line in slapstick comedy, with actors like [[André Deed]], known locally as "Cretinetti", and elsewhere as "Foolshead" and "Gribouille", achieving worldwide fame with his almost surrealistic gags.

The most important film-producing country in Northern Europe up until the First World War was Denmark. The [[Nordisk Film|Nordisk]] company was set up there in 1906 by [[Ole Olsen (filmmaker)|Ole Olsen]], a fairground showman, and after a brief period imitating the successes of French and British filmmakers, in 1907 he produced 67 films, most directed by Viggo Larsen, with sensational subjects like ''Den hvide Slavinde (The White Slave)'', ''Isbjørnenjagt (Polar Bear Hunt)'' and ''Løvejagten (The Lion Hunt)''. By 1910, new smaller Danish companies began joining the business, and besides making more films about the [[White Slavery (prostitution)|white slave trade]], they contributed other new subjects. The most important of these finds was [[Asta Nielsen]] in ''[[The Abyss (1910 film)|Afgrunden]] (The Abyss)'', directed by [[Urban Gad]] for Kosmorama, This combined the circus, sex, jealousy and murder, all put over with great conviction, and pushed the other Danish filmmakers further in this direction. By 1912, the Danish film companies were multiplying rapidly.

The [[Cinema of Sweden|Swedish film industry]] was smaller and slower to get started than the Danish industry. Here, the important man was [[Charles Magnusson]], a newsreel cameraman for the Svenskabiografteatern cinema chain. He started fiction film production for them in 1909, directing a number of the films himself. Production increased in 1912, when the company engaged [[Victor Sjöström]] and [[Mauritz Stiller]] as directors. They started out by imitating the subjects favoured by the Danish film industry, but by 1913 they were producing their own strikingly original work, which sold very well.

Russia began its film industry in 1908 with Pathé shooting some fiction subjects there, and then the creation of real Russian film companies by [[Aleksandr Drankov]] and [[Aleksandr Khanzhonkov]]. The Khanzhonkov company quickly became much the largest Russian film company, and remained so until 1918.

In Germany, [[Oskar Messter]] had been involved in film-making from 1896, but did not make a significant number of films per year until 1910. When the worldwide film boom started, he, and the few other people in the German film business, continued to sell prints of their own films outright, which put them at a disadvantage. It was only when [[Paul Davidson (producer)|Paul Davidson]], the owner of a chain of cinemas, brought Asta Nielsen and Urban Gad to Germany from Denmark in 1911, and set up a production company, Projektions-AG "Union" ([[PAGU]]), for them, that a change-over to renting prints began. Messter replied with a series of longer films starring Henny Porten, but although these did well in the German-speaking world, they were not particularly successful internationally, unlike the Asta Nielsen films. Another of the growing German film producers just before World War I was the German branch of the French [[Eclair (company)|Éclair]] company, Deutsche Éclair. This was expropriated by the German government, and turned into DECLA when the war started. But altogether, German producers only had a minor part of the German market in 1914.

Overall, from about 1910, American films had the largest share of the market in all European countries except France, and even in France, the American films had just pushed the local production out of first place on the eve of World War I. So even if the war had not happened, American films may have become dominant worldwide. Although the war made things much worse for European producers, the technical qualities of American films made them increasingly attractive to audiences everywhere.

===Film technique===
[[File:A.E. Smith filming The Bargain Fiend.gif|thumb|left|[[A.E. Smith]] filming ''The Bargain Fiend'' in the [[Vitagraph Studios]] in 1907. Arc floodlights hang overhead.]]
New film techniques that were introduced in this period include the use of artificial lighting, fire effects and [[Low-key lighting]] (i.e. lighting in which most of the frame is dark) for enhanced atmosphere during sinister scenes.

Continuity of action from shot to shot was also refined, such as in Pathé's ''le Cheval emballé (The Runaway Horse)'' (1907) where [[cross cutting|cross-cutting between parallel actions]] is used. [[David Wark Griffith|D. W. Griffith]] also began using cross-cutting in the film ''[[The Fatal Hour (1908 film)|The Fatal Hour]]'', made in July 1908. Another development was the use of the [[point of view shot|Point of View shot]], first used in 1910 in Vitagraph's ''Back to Nature''. Insert shots were also used for artistic purposes; the Italian film ''La mala planta (The Evil Plant)'', directed by [[Mario Caserini]] had an insert shot of a snake slithering over the "Evil Plant".

As films grew longer, specialist writers were employed to simplify more complex stories derived from novels or plays into a form that could be contained on one reel. [[Genres]] began to be used as categories; the main division was into comedy and drama, but these categories were further subdivided.

[[Intertitles]] containing lines of dialogue began to be used consistently from 1908 onwards, such as in Vitagraph's ''An Auto Heroine; or, The Race for the Vitagraph Cup and How It Was Won''. The dialogue was eventually inserted into the middle of the scene and became commonplace by 1912. The introduction of dialogue titles transformed the nature of film narrative. When dialogue titles came to be always cut into a scene just after a character starts speaking, and then left with a cut to the character just before they finish speaking, then one had something that was effectively the equivalent of a present-day sound film.

==During World War I==

===Industry===

The years of the [[First World War]] were a complex transitional period for the film industry. The exhibition of films changed from short one-reel programmes to feature films. Exhibition venues became larger and began charging higher prices.

In the United States, these changes brought destruction to many film companies, the Vitagraph company being an exception. Film production began to shift to [[Los Angeles]] during World War I. The [[Universal Studios|Universal Film Manufacturing Company]] was formed in 1912 as an umbrella company. New entrants included the [[Jesse L. Lasky|Jesse Lasky]] Feature Play Company, and Famous Players, both formed in 1913, and later amalgamated into [[Famous Players-Lasky]]. The biggest success of these years was [[David Wark Griffith]]'s ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915). Griffith followed this up with the even bigger ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916), but, due to the high quality of film produced in the US, the market for their films was high.

In France, film production shut down due to the general [[Mobilization|military mobilization]] of the country at the start of the war. Although film production began again in 1915, it was on a reduced scale, and the biggest companies gradually retired from production. Italian film production held up better, although so called "diva films", starring anguished female leads were a commercial failure. In Denmark, the Nordisk company increased its production so much in 1915 and 1916 that it could not sell all its films, which led to a very sharp decline in Danish production, and the end of Denmark's importance on the world film scene.

The [[Cinema of Germany|German film industry]] was seriously weakened by the war. The most important of the new film producers at the time was [[Joe May]], who made a series of thrillers and [[adventure film]]s through the war years, but [[Ernst Lubitsch]] also came into prominence with a series of very successful comedies and dramas.

===New techniques===
[[File:Die Austernprinzessin screenshot.gif|thumb|300px|Complex vignette shot in ''[[The Oyster Princess|die Austernprinzessin]] (The Oyster Princess)''.]]
At this time, studios were blacked out to allow shooting to be unaffected by changing sunlight. This was replaced with floodlights and spotlights. The widespread adoption of irising-in and out to begin and end scenes caught on in this period. This is the revelation of a film shot in a circular mask, which gradually gets larger until it expands beyond the frame. Other shaped slits were used, including vertical and diagonal apertures.

A new idea taken over from still photography was "[[soft focus]]". This began in 1915, with some shots being intentionally thrown out of focus for expressive effect, as in [[Mary Pickford]] starrer ''[[Fanchon the Cricket]]''.

It was during this period that camera effects intended to convey the subjective feelings of characters in a film really began to be established. These could now be done as Point of View ([[Point-of-view shot|POV]]) shots, as in Sidney Drew's ''The Story of the Glove'' (1915), where a wobbly hand-held shot of a door and its keyhole represents the POV of a drunken man. The use of anamorphic (in the general sense of distorted shape) images first appears in these years with [[Abel Gance]] directed ''[[la Folie du Docteur Tube]] (The Madness of Dr. Tube)''. In this film the effect of a drug administered to a group of people was suggested by shooting the scenes reflected in a [[Curved mirror|distorting mirror]] of the fair-ground type.

Symbolic effects taken over from conventional literary and artistic tradition continued to make some appearances in films during these years. In D. W. Griffith's ''[[The Avenging Conscience]]'' (1914), the title "The birth of the evil thought" precedes a series of three shots of the protagonist looking at a spider, and ants eating an insect. Symbolist art and literature from the turn of the century also had a more general effect on a small number of films made in Italy and Russia. The supine acceptance of death resulting from passion and forbidden longings was a major feature of this art, and states of delirium dwelt on at length were important as well.

[[File:Screenshot from Old Wives for New.gif|thumb|600px|Insert shot in ''[[Old Wives for New]]'' ([[Cecil B. DeMille]], 1918)]]
The use of [[Insert (filmmaking)|insert shots]], i.e. close-ups of objects other than faces, had already been established by the Brighton school, but were infrequently used before 1914. It is really only with Griffith's ''The Avenging Conscience'' that a new phase in the use of the Insert Shot starts. As well as the symbolic inserts already mentioned, the film also made extensive use of large numbers of Big Close Up shots of clutching hands and tapping feet as a means of emphasizing those parts of the body as indicators of psychological tension.

Atmospheric inserts were developed in Europe in the late 1910s. This kind of shot is one in a scene which neither contains any of the characters in the story, nor is a Point of View shot seen by one of them. An early example is in [[Maurice Tourneur]] directed ''[[The Pride of the Clan]]'' (1917), in which there is a series of shots of waves beating on a rocky shore to demonstrate the harsh lives of the fishing folk. [[Maurice Elvey]]'s ''[[Nelson (1918 film)|Nelson; The Story of England's Immortal Naval Hero]]'' (1919) has a symbolic sequence dissolving from a picture of [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] to a peacock, and then to a battleship.

By 1914, continuity cinema was the established mode of commercial cinema. One of the advanced continuity techniques involved an accurate and smooth transition from one shot to another. Cutting to ''different'' angles within a scene also became well-established as a technique for dissecting a scene into shots in American films. If the direction of the shot changes by more than ninety degrees, it is called a reverse-angle cutting. The leading figure in the full development of reverse-angle cutting was [[Ralph Ince]] in his films, such as ''The Right Girl'' and ''His Phantom Sweetheart''

The use of [[Flashback (narrative)|flash-back]] structures continued to develop in this period, with the usual way of entering and leaving a flash-back being through a dissolve. The Vitagraph company's ''The Man That Might Have Been'' ([[William J. Humphrey]], 1914), is even more complex, with a series of reveries and flash-backs that contrast the protagonist's real passage through life with what might have been, if his son had not died.

After 1914, [[cross cutting]] between parallel actions came to be used{{snd}} more so in American films than in European ones. Cross-cutting was often used to get new effects of contrast, such as the cross-cut sequence in [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Whispering Chorus]]'' (1918), in which a supposedly dead husband is having a liaison with a Chinese prostitute in an opium den, while simultaneously his unknowing wife is being remarried in church.

The general trend in the development of cinema, led from the United States, was towards using the newly developed specifically filmic devices for expression of the narrative content of film stories, and combining this with the standard dramatic structures already in use in commercial theatre. [[David Wark Griffith|D. W. Griffith]] had the highest standing amongst American directors in the industry, because of the dramatic excitement he conveyed to the audience through his films. [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Cheat (1915 film)|The Cheat]]'' (1915), brought out the moral dilemmas facing their characters in a more subtle way than Griffith. DeMille was also in closer touch with the reality of contemporary American life. [[Maurice Tourneur]] was also highly ranked for the pictorial beauties of his films, together with the subtlety of his handling of fantasy, while at the same time he was capable of getting greater [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] from his actors at appropriate moments, as in ''[[A Girl's Folly]]'' (1917).

[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Sidney Drew|Sidney Drew]] was the leader in developing "polite comedy", while slapstick was refined by [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]] and [[Charlie Chaplin|Charles Chaplin]], who both started with [[Mack Sennett]]'s Keystone company. They reduced the usual frenetic pace of Sennett's films to give the audience a chance to appreciate the subtlety and finesse of their movement, and the cleverness of their gags. By 1917 Chaplin was also introducing more dramatic plot into his films, and mixing the comedy with sentiment.

In Russia, [[Yevgeni Bauer]] put a slow intensity of acting combined with Symbolist overtones onto film in a unique way.

In Sweden, [[Victor Sjöström]] made a series of films that combined the realities of people's lives with their surroundings in a striking manner, while Mauritz Stiller developed sophisticated comedy to a new level.

In Germany, [[Ernst Lubitsch]] got his inspiration from the stage work of [[Max Reinhardt (director)|Max Reinhardt]], both in bourgeois comedy and in spectacle, and applied this to his films, culminating in his ''[[The Doll (1919 film)|die Puppe]]'' (''The Doll''), ''[[The Oyster Princess|die Austernprinzessin]]'' (''The Oyster Princess'') and ''[[Madame DuBarry (1919 film)|Madame DuBarry]]''.

===Hollywood triumphant===
[[File:Charlie_Chaplin_with_doll.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Charlie Chaplin]]]]
At the start of the [[First World War]], [[Cinema of France|French]] and [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] cinema had been the most globally popular. The war came as a devastating interruption to European film industries. The American industry, or "Hollywood", as it was becoming known after [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|its new geographical center in California]], gained the position it has held, more or less, ever since: film factory for the world and exporting its product to most countries on earth.

By the 1920s, the United States reached what is still its era of greatest-ever output, producing an average of 800 ''feature'' films annually,&lt;ref name="filmsite.org"/&gt; or 82% of the global total (Eyman, 1997). The comedies of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]], the [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling]] adventures of [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and the romances of [[Clara Bow]], to cite just a few examples, made these performers' faces well known on every continent. The Western visual norm that would become classical [[continuity editing]] was developed and exported – although its adoption was slower in some non-Western countries without strong [[realism (arts)|realist]] traditions in art and drama, such as [[Cinema of Japan|Japan]].

This development was contemporary with the growth of the [[studio system]] and its greatest publicity method, the [[star system (film)|star system]], which characterized American film for decades to come and provided models for other film industries. The studios' efficient, top-down control over all stages of their product enabled a new and ever-growing level of lavish production and technical sophistication. At the same time, the system's commercial regimentation and focus on glamorous [[escapism]] discouraged daring and ambition beyond a certain degree, a prime example being the brief but still legendary directing career of the iconoclastic [[Erich von Stroheim]] in the late teens and the 1920s.

==Sound era==
{{Main|Sound film}}
{{See also|1930s in film}}
[[File:DonJuanPoster2.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]] is the first feature-length film to utilize the Vitaphone sound-on-disc sound system with a synchronized musical score and sound effects, though it has no spoken dialogue.]]
During late 1927, Warners released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', which was mostly silent but contained what is generally regarded as the first synchronized dialogue (and singing) in a feature film; but this process was actually accomplished first by [[Charles Taze Russell]] in 1914 with the lengthy film ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]''. This drama consisted of picture slides and moving pictures synchronized with [[phonograph]] records of talks and music. The early [[sound-on-disc]] processes such as [[Vitaphone]] were soon superseded by [[sound-on-film]] methods like Fox [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]], DeForest [[Phonofilm]], and [[RCA Photophone]]. The trend convinced the largely reluctant industrialists that "talking pictures", or "talkies", were the future. A lot of attempts were made before the success of ''The Jazz Singer'', that can be seen in the [[List of film sound systems]].

The change was remarkably swift. By the end of 1929, Hollywood was almost all-talkie, with several competing sound systems (soon to be standardized). Total changeover was slightly slower in the rest of the world, principally for economic reasons. Cultural reasons were also a factor in countries like [[Cinema of China|China]] and [[Cinema of Japan|Japan]], where silents co-existed successfully with sound well into the 1930s, indeed producing what would be some of the most revered classics in those countries, like [[Wu Yonggang]]'s ''[[The Goddess (1934 film)|The Goddess]]'' (China, 1934) and [[Yasujirō Ozu]]'s ''[[I Was Born, But...]]'' (Japan, 1932). But even in Japan, a figure such as the [[benshi]], the live narrator who was a major part of Japanese silent cinema, found his acting career was ending.

Sound further tightened the grip of major studios in numerous countries: the vast expense of the transition overwhelmed smaller competitors, while the novelty of sound lured vastly larger audiences for those producers that remained. In the case of the U.S., some historians credit sound with saving the Hollywood studio system in the face of the [[Great Depression]] (Parkinson, 1995). Thus began what is now often called "The Golden Age of Hollywood", which refers roughly to the period beginning with the introduction of sound until the late 1940s. The American cinema reached its peak of efficiently manufactured glamour and global appeal during this period. The top actors of the era are now thought of as the classic film stars, such as [[Clark Gable]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Greta Garbo]], and the greatest box office draw of the 1930s, child performer [[Shirley Temple]].

===Creative impact of sound===
[[File:Poster - Gone With the Wind 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]|alt=A screencap of the title card from the trailer of Gone with the Wind.]]

Creatively, however, the rapid transition was a difficult one, and in some ways, film briefly reverted to the conditions of its earliest days. The late '20s were full of static, stagey talkies as artists in front of and behind the camera struggled with the stringent limitations of the early sound equipment and their own uncertainty as to how to utilize the new medium. Many stage performers, directors and writers were introduced to cinema as producers sought personnel experienced in dialogue-based storytelling. Many major silent filmmakers and actors were unable to adjust and found their careers severely curtailed or even ended.

This awkward period was fairly short-lived. 1929 was a watershed year: [[William Wellman]] with ''[[Chinatown Nights (1929 film)|Chinatown Nights]]'' and ''[[The Man I Love (1929 film)|The Man I Love]]'', [[Rouben Mamoulian]] with ''[[Applause (1929 film)|Applause]]'', [[Alfred Hitchcock]] with ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' (Britain's first sound feature), were among the directors to bring greater fluidity to talkies and experiment with the expressive use of sound (Eyman, 1997). In this, they both benefited from, and pushed further, technical advances in microphones and cameras, and capabilities for editing and post-synchronizing sound (rather than recording all sound directly at the time of filming).

[[Image:Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (13).jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Walt Disney]] introduces each of the seven dwarfs in a scene from the original 1937 ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'' theatrical trailer.]]
Sound films emphasized black history and benefited different [[genres]] more so than silents did. Most obviously, the [[musical film]] was born; the first classic-style Hollywood musical was ''[[The Broadway Melody]]'' (1929) and the form would find its first major creator in [[choreographer]]/director [[Busby Berkeley]] (''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'', 1933, ''[[Dames]]'', 1934). In France, [[avant-garde]] director [[René Clair]] made [[surrealism|surreal]] use of song and dance in comedies like ''[[Under the Roofs of Paris]]'' (1930) and ''[[Le Million]]'' (1931). [[Universal Pictures]] begin releasing [[gothic horror]] films like ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' and ''[[Frankenstein (1931)|Frankenstein]]'' (both 1931). In 1933, [[RKO Pictures]] released [[Merian C. Cooper]]'s classic "giant monster" film ''[[King Kong (1933)|King Kong]]''. The trend thrived best in [[Cinema of India|India]], where the influence of the country's traditional song-and-dance drama made the musical the basic form of most sound films (Cook, 1990); virtually unnoticed by the Western world for decades, this Indian popular cinema would nevertheless become the world's most prolific. (''See also [[Bollywood]].'')

At this time, American [[gangster film]]s like ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' and Wellman's ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' (both 1931) became popular. Dialogue now took precedence over "slapstick" in Hollywood comedies: the fast-paced, witty banter of ''[[The Front Page]]'' (1931) or ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), the sexual double entrendres of [[Mae West]] (''[[She Done Him Wrong]]'', 1933) or the often subversively anarchic nonsense talk of the [[Marx Brothers]] (''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', 1933). [[Walt Disney]], who had previously been in the short cartoon business, stepped into feature films with the first English-speaking animated feature ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''; released by [[RKO Pictures]] in 1937. 1939, a major year for American cinema, brought such films as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with The Wind]]''.

== Color in cinema ==
Previously, it was believed that color films were first projected in 1909 at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in London (the main problem with the color being that the technique, created by George Smith, ([[Kinemacolor]]) only used two colors: green and red, which were mixed additively). But in fact, it was in 1901 when the first color film in history was created. This untitled film was directed by photographer [[Edward Raymond Turner]] and his patron [[Fred Lee (cricketer, born 1871)|Frederick Marshall Lee]]. The way they did it was to use black and white film rolls, but have green, red, and blue filters go over the camera individually as it shot. To complete the film, they joined the original footage and filters on a special projector. However, both the shooting of the film and its projection suffered from major unrelated issues that, eventually, sank the idea.

Subsequently, in 1916, the [[technicolor]] technique arrived (trichromatic procedure (green, red, blue). Its use required a triple photographic impression, incorporation of chromatic filters and cameras of enormous dimensions). The first audiovisual piece that was completely realized with this technique was the short of [[Walt Disney]] "[[Flowers and Trees]]", directed by [[Burt Gillett]] in 1932. Even so, the first film to be performed with this technique will be "The Vanities Fair" (1935) by Rouben Mamoulian. Later on, the technicolor was extended mainly in the musical field as "[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]" or "[[Singin' in the Rain|Singing in the rain]]", in films such as "[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]" or the animation film, "[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]".&lt;ref name="esquire1"/&gt;

==World War II and its aftermath==
{{Main|1940s in film}}
The desire for wartime propaganda against the opposition created a renaissance in the film industry in Britain, with realistic war dramas like ''[[49th Parallel (film)|49th Parallel]]'' (1941), ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'' (1942), ''[[The Way Ahead]]'' (1944) and [[Noël Coward]] and [[David Lean]]'s celebrated naval film ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' in 1942, which won a special [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. These existed alongside more flamboyant films like [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]]'s ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]'' (1943), ''[[A Canterbury Tale]]'' (1944) and ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (1946), as well as [[Laurence Olivier]]'s [[1944 in film|1944 film]] ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'', based on the [[Shakespearean histories|Shakespearean history]] ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. The success of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' allowed Disney to make more animated features like ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941) and ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942).

The onset of US involvement in World War II also brought a proliferation of films as both [[patriotism]] and [[propaganda]]. American propaganda films included ''[[Desperate Journey]]'' (1942), ''[[Mrs. Miniver]]''  (1942), ''[[Forever and a Day (1943 film)|Forever and a Day]]'' (1943) and ''[[Objective, Burma!]]'' (1945). Notable American films from the war years include the anti-Nazi ''[[Watch on the Rhine]]'' (1943), scripted by [[Dashiell Hammett]]; ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), Hitchcock's direction of a script by [[Thornton Wilder]]; the [[George M. Cohan]] [[biopic]], ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' (1942), starring [[James Cagney]], and the immensely popular ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', with [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Bogart would star in 36 films between 1934 and 1942 including [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941), one of the first films now considered a classic [[film noir]]. In 1941, [[RKO Pictures]] released ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' made by [[Orson Welles]]. It is often considered the greatest film of all time. It would set the stage for the modern motion picture, as it revolutionized film story telling.

The strictures of wartime also brought an interest in more fantastical subjects. These included Britain's [[Gainsborough Pictures|Gainsborough]] melodramas (including ''[[The Man in Grey]]'' and ''[[The Wicked Lady]]''), and films like ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'', ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1943 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'', ''I Married a Witch'' and ''[[Blithe Spirit (1945 film)|Blithe Spirit]]''. [[Val Lewton]] also produced a series of atmospheric and influential small-budget [[horror film|horror]] films, some of the more famous examples being ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'', ''[[Isle of the Dead (film)|Isle of the Dead]]'' and ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]''. The decade probably also saw the so-called "women's pictures", such as ''[[Now, Voyager]]'', ''[[Random Harvest (film)|Random Harvest]]'' and ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' at the peak of their popularity.

1946 saw RKO Radio releasing ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' directed by [[Frank Capra]]. Soldiers returning from the war would provide the inspiration for films like ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'', and many of those in the film industry had served in some capacity during the war. [[Samuel Fuller]]'s experiences in World War II would influence his largely autobiographical films of later decades such as ''[[The Big Red One]]''. [[The Actor's Studio]] was founded in October 1947 by [[Elia Kazan]], [[Robert Lewis (actor)|Robert Lewis]], and [[Cheryl Crawford]], and the same year [[Oskar Fischinger]] filmed ''[[Motion Painting No. 1]]''.

In 1943, ''Ossessione'' was screened in Italy, marking the beginning of [[Italian neorealism]]. Major films of this type during the 1940s included ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'', ''[[Rome, Open City]]'', and ''[[La Terra Trema]]''. In 1952 ''[[Umberto D]]'' was released, usually considered the last film of this type.

In the late 1940s, in Britain, [[Ealing Studios]] embarked on their series of celebrated comedies, including ''[[Whisky Galore! (1949 film)|Whisky Galore!]]'', ''[[Passport to Pimlico]]'', ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' and ''[[The Man in the White Suit]]'', and [[Carol Reed]] directed his influential thrillers ''[[Odd Man Out]]'', ''[[The Fallen Idol (film)|The Fallen Idol]]'' and ''[[The Third Man]]''. [[David Lean]] was also rapidly becoming a force in world cinema with ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' and his [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] adaptations ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'' and ''[[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|Oliver Twist]]'', and [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]] would experience the best of their creative partnership with films like ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' and ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]''.

==1950s==
{{Main|1950s in film}}
[[File:Charlton Heston as Antony in Julius Caesar, B&amp;W image by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|thumb|300px|A production scene from the 1950 Hollywood film ''[[Julius Caesar (1950 film)|Julius Caesar]]'' starring [[Charlton Heston]].]]
The [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] investigated Hollywood in the early 1950s. Protested by the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]] before the committee, the hearings resulted in the [[blacklist]]ing of many actors, writers and directors, including Chayefsky, [[Charlie Chaplin]], and [[Dalton Trumbo]], and many of these fled to Europe, especially the United Kingdom.

The [[Cold War|Cold War era]] [[zeitgeist]] translated into a type of near-[[paranoia]] manifested in [[theme (literature)|theme]]s such as [[alien invasion|invading armies of evil aliens]], (''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'', ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]''); and [[communism|communist]] [[fifth column]]ists, (''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'').

During the immediate post-war years the cinematic industry was also threatened by television, and the increasing popularity of the medium meant that some film theatres would bankrupt and close. The demise of the "studio system" spurred the [[Criticism|self-commentary]] of films like ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).

In 1950, the [[Lettrists]] avante-gardists caused riots at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], when [[Isidore Isou]]'s ''Treatise on Slime and Eternity'' was screened. After their criticism of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and split with the movement, the [[Ultra-Lettrist]]s continued to cause disruptions when they showed their new [[hypergraphics|hypergraphical]] techniques.
The most notorious film is [[Guy Debord]]'s ''Howls for Sade'' of 1952.

Distressed by the increasing number of closed theatres, studios and companies would find new and innovative ways to bring audiences back. These included attempts to widen their appeal with new screen formats. [[Cinemascope]], which would remain a [[20th Century Fox]] distinction until 1967, was announced with 1953's ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]''. [[VistaVision]], [[Cinerama]], and [[Todd-AO]] boasted a "bigger is better" approach to [[marketing]] films to a dwindling US audience. This resulted in the revival of epic films to take advantage of the new big screen formats. Some of the most successful examples of these [[Bible|Biblical]] and [[history|historical]] spectaculars include ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), ''[[The Vikings (film)|The Vikings]]'' (1958), ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) and ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'' (1961). Also during this period a number of other significant films were produced in [[Todd-AO]], developed by [[Mike Todd]] shortly before his death, including [[Oklahoma!]] (1955), [[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]] (1956), [[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]] (1958) and [[Cleopatra]] (1963) plus many more.

[[Gimmick]]s also proliferated to lure in audiences. The fad for [[3-D film]] would last for only two years, 1952–1954, and helped sell ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'' and ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''. Producer [[William Castle]] would tout films featuring "Emergo" "Percepto", the first of a series of gimmicks that would remain popular marketing tools for Castle and others throughout the 1960s.

In the U.S., a post-WW2 tendency toward questioning the establishment and societal norms and the early [[activism]] of the [[civil rights movement]] was reflected in Hollywood films such as ''[[Blackboard Jungle]]'' (1955), ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954), [[Paddy Chayefsky]]'s ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' and [[Reginald Rose]]'s ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' (1957). Disney continued making animated films, notably; ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953), ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), and ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959). He began, however, getting more involved in live action films, producing classics like ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954), and ''[[Old Yeller (1957 film)|Old Yeller]]'' (1957). Television began competing seriously with films projected in theatres, but surprisingly it promoted more filmgoing rather than curtailing it.

''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' is probably a unique film in at least one interesting respect. Its two leads, [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Claire Bloom]], were in the industry in no less than three different centuries. In the 19th Century, Chaplin made his theatrical debut at the age of eight, in 1897, in a clog dancing troupe, The Eight Lancaster Lads. In the 21st Century, Bloom is still enjoying a full and productive career, having appeared in dozens of films and television series produced up to and including 2013.  She received particular acclaim for her role in ''[[The King's Speech]]'' (2010).

During [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese cinema]]'s 'Golden Age' of the 1950s, successful films included ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' (1950), ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'' (1958) by [[Akira Kurosawa]], as well as [[Yasujirō Ozu]]'s ''[[Tokyo Story]]'' (1953) and [[Ishirō Honda]]'s ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1954).&lt;ref&gt;Dave Kehr, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E5D71238F933A15752C0A9649C8B63 Anime, Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 20, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These films have had a profound influence on world cinema. In particular, Kurosawa's ''Seven Samurai'' has been remade several times as [[Western (genre)|Western films]], such as ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' (1960) and ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980), and has also inspired several [[Bollywood]] films, such as ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) and ''[[China Gate (1998 film)|China Gate]]'' (1998). ''Rashomon'' was also remade as ''[[The Outrage]]'' (1964), and inspired films with "[[Rashomon effect]]" storytelling methods, such as ''[[Andha Naal]]'' (1954), ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995) and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002). ''The Hidden Fortress'' was also the inspiration behind [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977). Other famous Japanese filmmakers from this period include [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Mikio Naruse]], [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] and [[Nagisa Oshima]].&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; Japanese cinema later became one of the main inspirations behind the [[New Hollywood]] movement of the 1960s to 1980s.

During [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]]'s 'Golden Age' of the 1950s, it was producing 200 films annually, while [[Parallel Cinema|Indian independent films]] gained greater recognition through international [[film festival]]s. One of the most famous was ''[[The Apu Trilogy]]'' (1955–1959) from critically acclaimed [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film]] director [[Satyajit Ray]], whose films had a profound influence on world cinema, with directors such as Akira Kurosawa,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The [[cinema of South Korea]] also experienced a 'Golden Age' in the 1950s, beginning with director Lee Kyu-hwan's tremendously successful remake of ''Chunhyang-jon'' (1955).&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Korean Film|first=Jon|last=Marshall|url=http://www.pusanweb.com/Exit/Oct97/briefhist.htm|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year also saw the release of ''[[Yangsan Province (film)|Yangsan Province]]'' by the renowned director, [[Kim Ki-young]], marking the beginning of his productive career. Both the quality and quantity of filmmaking had increased rapidly by the end of the 1950s. South Korean films, such as Lee Byeong-il's 1956 comedy ''Sijibganeun nal (The Wedding Day)'', had begun winning international awards. In contrast to the beginning of the 1950s, when only 5 films were made per year, 111 films were produced in South Korea in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Darcy|last=Paquet|title=1945–1959|publisher=Korean Film Page|url=http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm45-59.html|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s was also a 'Golden Age' for [[Cinema of the Philippines|Philippine cinema]], with the emergence of more artistic and mature films, and significant improvement in cinematic techniques among filmmakers. The studio system produced frenetic activity in the local film industry as many films were made annually and several local talents started to earn recognition abroad. The premiere Philippine directors of the era included [[Gerardo de Leon]], [[Gregorio Fernández (director)|Gregorio Fernández]], [[Eddie Romero]], [[Lamberto Avellana]], and [[Cirio Santiago]].&lt;ref name="curtain"&gt;[http://www.philnews.com/2005/wa.html Is the Curtain Finally Falling on the Philippine Kovie Industry?].

==1960s==
{{Main|1960s in film}}
During the 1960s, the studio system in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] declined, because many films were now being made on location in other countries, or using studio facilities abroad, such as [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]] in the UK and [[Cinecittà]] in Rome. "Hollywood" films were still largely aimed at family audiences, and it was often the more old-fashioned films that produced the studios' biggest successes. Productions like ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965) were among the biggest money-makers of the decade. The growth in independent producers and production companies, and the increase in the power of individual actors also contributed to the decline of traditional Hollywood studio production.

There was also an increasing awareness of foreign language cinema in America during this period. During the late 1950s and 1960s, the [[French New Wave]] directors such as [[François Truffaut]] and [[Jean-Luc Godard]] produced films such as ''[[The 400 Blows|Les quatre cents coups]]'', ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' and ''[[Jules et Jim]]'' which broke the rules of Hollywood cinema's [[narrative structure]]. As well, audiences were becoming aware of Italian films like [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' and the stark dramas of Sweden's [[Ingmar Bergman]].

In Britain, the "Free Cinema" of [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[Tony Richardson]] and others lead to a group of realistic and innovative dramas including ''[[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (film)|Saturday Night and Sunday Morning]]'', ''[[A Kind of Loving (film)|A Kind of Loving]]'' and ''[[This Sporting Life]]''. Other British films such as ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'', ''[[Darling (1965 film)|Darling]]'', ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]'', ''[[Blowup]]'' and ''[[Georgy Girl]]'' (all in 1965–1966) helped to reduce prohibitions sex and nudity on screen, while the casual sex and violence of the [[James Bond]] films, beginning with ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' in 1962 would render the series popular worldwide.

During the 1960s, [[Ousmane Sembène]] produced several French- and [[Wolof language|Wolof-language]] films and became the "father" of [[African Cinema]]. In Latin America, the dominance of the "Hollywood" model was challenged by many film makers. [[Fernando Solanas]] and [[Octavio Getino]] called for a politically engaged [[Third Cinema]] in contrast to Hollywood and the European [[auteur]] cinema.

Further, the nuclear paranoia of the age, and the threat of an apocalyptic nuclear exchange (like the 1962 close-call with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] during the [[Cuban missile crisis]]) prompted a reaction within the film community as well. Films like [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' and ''[[Fail-Safe (1964 film)|Fail Safe]]'' with [[Henry Fonda]] were produced in a Hollywood that was once known for its overt patriotism and wartime propaganda.

In [[documentary film]] the sixties saw the blossoming of [[Direct Cinema]], an observational style of film making as well as the advent of more overtly partisan films like ''[[In the Year of the Pig]]'' about the [[Vietnam War]] by [[Emile de Antonio]]. By the late 1960s however, Hollywood filmmakers were beginning to create more innovative and groundbreaking films that reflected the social revolution taken over much of the western world such as ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967), ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967), ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' (1969), ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) and ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' is often considered the beginning of the so-called [[New Hollywood]].

In Japanese cinema, Academy Award-winning director [[Akira Kurosawa]] produced ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961), which like his previous films also had a profound influence around the world. The influence of this film is most apparent in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964) and [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s ''[[Last Man Standing (1996 film)|Last Man Standing]]'' (1996). ''Yojimbo'' was also the origin of the "[[Man with No Name]]" trend.

==1970s==
{{Main|1970s in film}}
The [[New Hollywood]] was the period following the decline of the [[studio system]] during the 1950s and 1960s and the end of the [[production code]], (which was replaced in 1968 by the [[MPAA film rating system]]). During the 1970s, filmmakers increasingly depicted explicit sexual content and showed gunfight and battle scenes that included graphic images of bloody deaths{{snd}} a good example of this is [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972).

Post-classical cinema is the changing methods of storytelling of the New Hollywood producers. The new methods of [[drama]] and characterization played upon audience expectations acquired during the classical/Golden Age period: story chronology may be scrambled, storylines may feature unsettling "[[twist ending]]s", main characters may behave in a morally ambiguous fashion, and the lines between the [[antagonist]] and [[protagonist]] may be blurred. The beginnings of post-classical storytelling may be seen in 1940s and 1950s [[film noir]] films, in films such as ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955), and in Hitchcock's ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. 1971 marked the release of controversial films like ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'', ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' and ''[[Dirty Harry]]''. This sparked heated controversy over the perceived escalation of violence in cinema.

During the 1970s, a new group of American filmmakers emerged, such as [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[George Lucas]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Terrence Malick]], and [[Robert Altman]]. This coincided with the increasing popularity of the [[auteur theory]] in film literature and the media, which posited that a film director's films express their personal vision and creative insights. The development of the auteur style of filmmaking helped to give these directors far greater control over their projects than would have been possible in earlier eras. This led to some great critical and commercial successes, like Scorsese's ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', Coppola's ''[[The Godfather]]'' films, [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', Altman's ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'', Allen's ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'', Malick's ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' and ''[[Days of Heaven]]'', and Polish immigrant [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''. It also, however, resulted in some failures, including [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s ''[[At Long Last Love]]'' and [[Michael Cimino]]'s hugely expensive Western epic ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', which helped to bring about the demise of its backer, [[United Artists]].

The financial disaster of ''Heaven's Gate'' marked the end of the visionary "auteur" directors of the "New Hollywood", who had unrestrained creative and financial freedom to develop films. The phenomenal success in the 1970s of [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' originated the concept of the modern "[[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]". However, the enormous success of George Lucas' 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' led to much more than just the popularization of blockbuster film-making. The film's revolutionary use of special effects, sound editing and music had led it to become widely regarded as one of the single most important films in the medium's history, as well as the most influential film of the 1970s. Hollywood studios increasingly focused on producing a smaller number of very large budget films with massive marketing and promotional campaigns. This trend had already been foreshadowed by the commercial success of [[disaster film]]s such as ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' and ''[[The Towering Inferno (film)|The Towering Inferno]]''.

During the mid-1970s, more pornographic theatres, euphemistically called "adult cinemas", were established, and the legal production of [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] films began. Porn films such as ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and its star [[Linda Lovelace]] became something of a popular culture phenomenon and resulted in a spate of similar sex films. The porn cinemas finally died out during the 1980s, when the popularization of the home [[VCR]] and pornography videotapes allowed audiences to watch sex films at home. In the early 1970s, English-language audiences became more aware of the new [[West German]] cinema, with [[Werner Herzog]], [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] and [[Wim Wenders]] among its leading exponents.

In [[world cinema]], the 1970s saw a dramatic increase in the popularity of [[martial arts film]]s, largely due to its reinvention by [[Bruce Lee]], who departed from the artistic style of traditional [[Chinese martial arts]] films and added a much greater sense of realism to them with his [[Jeet Kune Do]] style. This began with ''[[The Big Boss]]'' (1971), which was a major success across [[Asian cinema|Asia]]. However, he didn't gain fame in the [[Western world]] until shortly after his death in 1973, when ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' was released. The film went on to become the most successful martial arts film in cinematic history, popularized the martial arts film genre across the world, and cemented Bruce Lee's status as a cultural icon. [[Hong Kong action cinema]], however, was in decline due to a wave of "[[Bruceploitation]]" films. This trend eventually came to an end in 1978 with the martial arts [[comedy film]]s, ''[[Snake in the Eagle's Shadow]]'' and ''[[Drunken Master]]'', directed by [[Yuen Woo-ping]] and starring [[Jackie Chan]], laying the foundations for the rise of Hong Kong action cinema in the 1980s.

While the [[musical film]] genre had declined in Hollywood by this time, musical films were quickly gaining popularity in the [[cinema of India]], where the term "[[Bollywood]]" was coined for the growing [[Hindi]] film industry in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] (now Mumbai) that ended up dominating [[South Asian cinema]], overtaking the more critically acclaimed [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film industry]] in popularity. Hindi filmmakers combined the Hollywood musical formula with the conventions of ancient [[Theatre of India|Indian theatre]] to create a new film genre called "[[Masala (film genre)|Masala]]", which dominated Indian cinema throughout the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indian Popular Cinema: A Narrative of Cultural Change|last=K. Moti Gokulsing|first=K. Gokulsing, Wimal Dissanayake|publisher=Trentham Books|year=2004|isbn=1-85856-329-1|pages=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "Masala" films portrayed [[Action film|action]], comedy, [[Drama film|drama]], [[Romance film|romance]] and [[melodrama]] all at once, with "[[filmi]]" song and dance routines thrown in. This trend began with films directed by [[Manmohan Desai]] and starring [[Amitabh Bachchan]], who remains one of the most popular [[film star]]s in South Asia. The most popular Indian film of all time was ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), a "Masala" film inspired by a real-life [[Dacoity|dacoit]] as well as Kurosawa's ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' and the [[Spaghetti Western]]s.

The end of the decade saw the first major international marketing of [[Australia]]n cinema, as [[Peter Weir]]'s films ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' and ''[[The Last Wave]]'' and [[Fred Schepisi]]'s ''[[The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (film)|The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith]]'' gained critical acclaim. In 1979, Australian filmmaker [[George Miller (producer)|George Miller]] also garnered international attention for his violent, low-budget action film ''[[Mad Max]]''.

==1980s==
{{Main|1980s in film}}
[[File:The_Expendables_2_Cast_Roster.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ensemble cast of action stars of the 80s, including (left to right) [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Jason Statham]], [[Jet Li]], [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Chuck Norris]], [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Terry Crews]]]]
During the 1980s, audiences began increasingly watching films on their home [[VCR]]s. In the early part of that decade, the [[film studio]]s tried legal action to ban home ownership of VCRs as a violation of [[copyright]], which proved unsuccessful. Eventually, the sale and rental of films on [[home video]] became a significant "second venue" for exhibition of films, and an additional source of revenue for the film industries.

The [[George Lucas|Lucas]]–[[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]] combine would dominate "Hollywood" cinema for much of the 1980s, and lead to much imitation. Two follow-ups to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', three to ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', and three ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' films helped to make sequels of successful films more of an expectation than ever before. Lucas also launched [[THX|THX Ltd]], a division of [[Lucasfilm]] in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thx.com/mod/company/milestones.html |title=THX Milestones |accessdate=2006-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109131348/http://www.thx.com/mod/company/milestones.html |archivedate=2006-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Spielberg enjoyed one of the decade's greatest successes in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' the same year. 1982 also saw the release of Disney's ''[[Tron]]'' which was one of the first films from a major studio to use [[computer graphics]] extensively. American independent cinema struggled more during the decade, although [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980), ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), and ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]'' (1983) helped to establish him as one of the most critically acclaimed American film makers of the era. Also during 1983 ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' was released, which was very profitable and resulted in even greater fame for its leading actor [[Al Pacino]]. Probably{{weasel inline|date=August 2018}} the most successful film commercially was [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 version of [[Bob Kane]]'s creation, ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', which broke box-office records. [[Jack Nicholson]]'s portrayal of the demented [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] earned him a total of $60,000,000 after figuring in his percentage of the gross.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

British cinema was given a boost during the early 1980s by the arrival of [[David Puttnam]]'s company [[Goldcrest Films]]. The films ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'', ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'' and ''[[A Room with a View (1986 film)|A Room with a View]]'' appealed to a "middlebrow" audience which was increasingly being ignored by the major Hollywood studios. While the films of the 1970s had helped to define modern [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] motion pictures, the way "Hollywood" released its films would now change. Films, for the most part, would premiere in a wider number of theatres, although, to this day, some films still premiere using the route of the [[Roadshow theatrical release|limited/roadshow release system]]. Against some expectations, the rise of the multiplex cinema did not allow less mainstream films to be shown, but simply allowed the major blockbusters to be given an even greater number of screenings. However, films that had been overlooked in cinemas were increasingly being given a second chance on home video.

During the 1980s, [[Japanese cinema]] experienced a revival, largely due to the success of [[anime]] films. At the beginning of the 1980s, ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' (1973) and ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' (1979), both of which were unsuccessful as television series, were remade as films and became hugely successful in Japan. In particular, ''Mobile Suit Gundam'' sparked the [[Gundam]] franchise of [[Real Robot]] [[mecha]] anime. The success of ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?|Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'' also sparked a [[Macross]] franchise of mecha anime. This was also the decade when [[Studio Ghibli]] was founded. The studio produced [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s first [[fantasy film]]s, ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]'' (1984) and ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' (1986), as well as [[Isao Takahata]]'s ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]'' (1988), all of which were very successful in Japan and received worldwide critical acclaim. [[Original video animation]] (OVA) films also began during this decade; the most influential of these early OVA films was [[Noboru Ishiguro]]'s [[cyberpunk]] film ''[[Megazone 23]]'' (1985). The most famous anime film of this decade was [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]'s cyberpunk film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (1988), which although initially unsuccessful at Japanese theaters, went on to become an international success.

[[Hong Kong action cinema]], which was in a state of decline due to endless [[Bruceploitation]] films after the death of [[Bruce Lee]], also experienced a revival in the 1980s, largely due to the reinvention of the [[action film]] genre by [[Jackie Chan]]. He had previously combined the [[comedy film]] and [[martial arts film]] genres successfully in the 1978 films ''[[Snake in the Eagle's Shadow]]'' and ''[[Drunken Master]]''. The next step he took was in combining this comedy martial arts genre with a new emphasis on elaborate and highly dangerous [[stunt]]s, reminiscent of the [[silent film]] era. The first film in this new style of action cinema was ''[[Project A]]'' (1983), which saw the formation of the [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team]] as well as the "Three Brothers" (Chan, [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]]). The film added elaborate, dangerous stunts to the fights and [[slapstick]] humor, and became a huge success throughout the [[Far East]]. As a result, Chan continued this trend with martial arts action films containing even more elaborate and dangerous stunts, including ''[[Wheels on Meals]]'' (1984), ''[[Police Story (1985 film)|Police Story]]'' (1985), ''[[Armour of God (film)|Armour of God]]'' (1986), ''[[Project A Part II]]'' (1987), ''[[Police Story 2]]'' (1988), and ''[[Dragons Forever]]'' (1988). Other new trends which began in the 1980s were the "[[girls with guns]]" subgenre, for which [[Michelle Yeoh]] gained fame; and especially the "[[heroic bloodshed]]" genre, revolving around [[Triad (underground societies)|Triads]], largely pioneered by [[John Woo]] and for which [[Chow Yun-fat]] became famous. These Hong Kong action trends were later adopted by many Hollywood action films in the 1990s and 2000s.

==1990s==
{{Main|1990s in film}}
The early 1990s saw the development of a commercially successful independent cinema in the United States. Although cinema was increasingly dominated by special-effects films such as ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993) and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997), the latter of which became the highest-grossing film of all time at the time up until ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009), also directed by James Cameron, independent films like [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'' (1989) and [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992) had significant commercial success both at the cinema and on home video. Filmmakers associated with the Danish film movement [[Dogme 95]] introduced a manifesto aimed to purify filmmaking. Its first few films gained worldwide critical acclaim, after which the movement slowly faded out.

[[File:1995cinema admissions.png|thumb|250px|right|Cinema admissions in 1995]]
Major American studios began to create their own [[independent film|"independent" production companies]] to finance and produce non-mainstream fare. One of the most successful independents of the 1990s, [[Miramax Films]], was bought by Disney the year before the release of Tarantino's runaway hit ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' in 1994. The same year marked the beginning of film and video distribution online. Animated films aimed at family audiences also regained their popularity, with Disney's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), and ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994). During 1995, the first feature length [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] feature, ''[[Toy Story]]'', was produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and released by Disney. After the success of Toy Story, computer animation would grow to become the dominant technique for feature length animation, which would allow competing film companies such as [[DreamWorks Animation]] and [[20th Century Fox]] to effectively compete with Disney with successful films of their own. During the late 1990s, another cinematic transition began, from physical film stock to [[digital cinema]] technology. Meanwhile, [[DVD]]s became the new standard for consumer video, replacing VHS tapes.

==Recent years==
{{Main|2000s in film|2010s in film}}
The [[documentary film]] also rose as a commercial genre for perhaps the first time, with the success of films such as ''[[March of the Penguins]]'' and [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' and ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''. A new genre was created with [[Martin Kunert]] and [[Eric Manes]]' ''[[Voices of Iraq]]'', when 150 inexpensive DV cameras were distributed across Iraq, transforming ordinary people into collaborative filmmakers. The success of ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' led to a revival of interest in [[epic film|epic cinema]], and ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' renewed interest in [[musical film|musical cinema]]. [[home cinema|Home theatre]] systems became increasingly sophisticated, as did some of the special edition [[DVD]]s designed to be shown on them. ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings trilogy]]'' was released on DVD in both the theatrical version and in a special extended version intended only for home cinema audiences.

In 2001, the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]] began, and by its end in 2011, it had become the highest-grossing film franchise of all time until the Marvel Cinematic Universe passed it in 2015.

More films were also being released simultaneously to [[IMAX]] cinema, the first was in 2002's Disney animation ''[[Treasure Planet]]''; and the first live action was in 2003's ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' and a re-release of ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''. Later in the decade, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' was the first major feature film to have been at least partially shot in IMAX technology.

There has been an increasing globalization of cinema during this decade, with foreign-language films gaining popularity in English-speaking markets. Examples of such films include ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (Mandarin), ''[[Amélie]]'' (French), ''[[Lagaan]]'' (Hindi), ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japanese), ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'' (Brazilian Portuguese), ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (Aramaic), ''[[Apocalypto]]'' (Mayan) and ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' (multiple European languages). Italy is the most awarded country at the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], with 14 awards won, 3 Special Awards and 31 [[List of Italian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|nominations]].

In 2003 there was a revival in 3D film popularity the first being James Cameron's ''[[Ghosts of the Abyss]]'' which was released as the first full-length 3-D IMAX feature filmed with the [[Reality Camera System]]. This camera system used the latest HD video cameras, not film, and was built for Cameron by Emmy nominated Director of Photography Vince Pace, to his specifications. The same camera system was used to film ''[[Spy Kids 3D: Game Over]]'' (2003), ''[[Aliens of the Deep]]'' IMAX (2005), and ''[[The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D]]'' (2005).

After James Cameron's 3D film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' became the highest-grossing film of all time, 3D films gained brief popularity with many other films being released in 3D, with the best critical and financial successes being in the field of feature film animation such as [[Universal Pictures]]/[[Illumination Entertainment]]'s ''[[Despicable Me]]'' and [[DreamWorks Animation]]'s ''[[How To Train Your Dragon (film)|How To Train Your Dragon]]'', ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' and ''[[Megamind]]''. ''Avatar'' is also note-worthy for pioneering highly sophisticated use of motion capture technology and influencing several other films such as ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]''. However the popularity of 3D steadily declined over the subsequent seven years to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2018/film/news/3d-box-office-1202743603/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2010}}, the largest film industries by number of feature films produced were those of India, the United States, China, Nigeria and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2044888,00.html| title=As Its Box Office Booms, Chinese Cinema Makes a 3-D Push | work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Brenhouse, Hillary|date=2011-01-31| accessdate=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2008 with ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', [[superhero film]]s have greatly increased in popularity and financial success, with films based on [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics|DC comics]] regularly being released every year up to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Helmore|first1=Edward|title=They're here to save the world: but how many superhero movies can we take?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/01/superhero-movies-black-panther-captain-marvel|accessdate=29 November 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Map of Pompeii. House of the Vettii highlighted in red.
]]The '''House of the Vettii''' is a [[domus]] located in the Roman town, [[Pompeii]], which was preserved by the [[Vesuvius|eruption of Vesuvius]] in 79 AD. The house is named for its owners, two successful [[Freedman|freedmen]]: Aulus Vettius Conviva, an [[sodales Augustales|Augustalis]], and Aulus Vettius Restitutus.&lt;ref&gt;Their identity was preserved in campaign-slogan graffiti on the street front of the house. Two inscribed signet rings were also found.&lt;/ref&gt; Its careful excavation&lt;ref&gt;The House of the Vettii was not one of the eighteenth-century discoveries, which were rifled for their museum-worthy objects. It was excavated between September 1894 and January 1896. There is evidence that the house was disturbed, perhaps looted, shortly after the eruption.&lt;/ref&gt; has preserved almost all of the wall [[fresco]]s, which were completed following the [[62 Pompeii earthquake|earthquake of 62 AD]], in the manner art historians term the [[Pompeian Styles#Fourth Style|Pompeiian Fourth Style]]. The House of Vetti is located in region VI, near the Vesuvian Gate, bordered by the Vicolo di Mercurio and the Vicolo dei Vettii. The house is one of the largest domus in Pompeii, spanning the entire southern section of block 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beth|first=Severy-Hoven|date=November 2012|title=Master Narratives and the Wall Painting of the House of the Vettii|url=|journal=Gender &amp; History|volume= 24 (no. 3)|pages=540–580|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan is fashioned in a typical Roman domus with the exception of a [[tablinum]], which is not included. There are twelve mythological scenes across four [[triclinium]] and one [[cubiculum]].

==Plan==
[[File:Casa dei vetti - planimetria.svg|frameless|left|Floor Plan]]
The plan of the House of the Vettii is commonly divided into five major sections: the large [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], the small atrium, the  large peristyle, the small peristyle, and the shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Paintings of the Casa Dei Vettii in Pompeii|last=Archer|first=William|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house features a large garden as well as main living quarters and servant quarters.The service areas are centered around the smaller atrium while the main occupants remained around the larger atrium. There are two entrances to the main sections of the house, the main entrance is located on the east facade, entered from the Vicolo dei Vettii, and the second is entered from the Vicoli di Mercurio on the southern facade. In addition, there are five small windows on the east facade,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Paintings of the Casa Dei Vettii in Pompeii|last=Archer|first=William|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=434}}&lt;/ref&gt; two narrow vertical windows on the south facade,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Paintings of Casa Dei Vettii in Pompeii|last=Archer|first=William|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a single small window on the west facade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Paintings of the Casa Dei Vettii in Pompeii|last=Archer|first=William|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small atrium and small peristyle are located on the north section of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Severy-Hoven|first=Beth|date=November 2012|title=Master Narratives and the Wall Painting of the House of the Vettii|url=|journal=Gender &amp; History|volume= 24 (no. 3)|pages=544|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large atrium is surrounded by four [[cubiculum|cubicula]] (bedrooms), which belonged most likely to the main occupants of the house. There are also two alae and a winter [[triclinium]] surrounding the atrium. To enter the atrium from the main entrance, one has to pass through the [[Fauces (architecture)|fauces]] and [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibulum]]. The small atrium is surrounded by four rooms which are believed to have been used by servants and as storage rooms. A kitchen is also located near the small atrium along with a cubiculum meant to house the cook and an [[impluvium]], which was designed to catch rainwater from an opening in the roof A staircase was found in the southeast corner of the small atrium but the second floor no longer remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Paintings of the Casa Dei Vettii in Pompeii|last=Archer|first=William|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two service areas in the house, the first being centered around the small atrium. The second was accessible from the main atrium of the house as well as the second entrance from the Vicolo di Mercurio on the south facade. Here a large gate opened into the shop or otherwise known as the [[taberna]]e. Draft animals were moved through this gate and stabled in the shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Severy-Hoven|first=Beth|date=November 2012|title=Master Narratives and the Wall Painting of the House of the Vettii|url=|journal=Gender &amp; History|volume= 24 (no. 3)|pages=544|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the shop is an additional chamber and latrine.

When looking through the main entrance and large atrium, it is possible to view the rear garden, surrounded by the large peristyle. Onlooking the peristyle are two [[triclinia]], an [[oecus]], and two storage rooms. Most of the rooms in the house open to either the front hall or rear garden. The small peristyle is located to the north of the house. Beside the small peristyle are a triclinium and a cubiculum.

Unique to the House of the Vettii, a [[tablinum]] is not included in the plan.

== Paintings ==
[[Image:Casa_dei_vettii_ixion.png|thumb|A Victorian rendering of paintings in the ''Ixion room''|244x244px]]The House of the Vettii features a large assortment of fresco paintings in the [[Pompeian Styles|Pompeian Fourth style]]. There are twelve surviving panels, which depict mythological scenes. We know that it is the Fourth style by its combination of the previous three styles. At the bottom of the wall we see a ring of faux colored marble, which is indicative of the First Pompeian style. Secondly, there is an interest in creating illusionistic scenes, evident in the top ring and besides the mythological scenes, that is borrowed from the Second style. Lastly, the unrealistically thin columns supporting the upper ring of the wall frescoes is taken from the Third style. New to the style is the mythological scenes, of which there are twelve remaining in the House of the Vettii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/roman/wall-painting/a/roman-wall-painting-styles|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the scenes are copied from Greek models, but no Greek paintings have survived to compare the frescoes to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Paintings of the Casa Dei Vettii in Pompeii|last=Archer|first=William Carthon|publisher=University of Virginia, ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|year=1981|isbn=|location=|pages=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twelve panels are located in the two triclinia positioned off of the peristyle garden and the triclinium next to the small peristyle.

Beyond the twelve mythological paintings, many more artworks are displayed in the House of the Vettii. Most famously are the two depictions of [[Priapus]], the god of fertility. The first image of Priapus is a fresco in the doorway. The painting depicts Priapus weighing his phallic member on a set of scales. The second image mirrors the first but in marble.

=== Punishment of Ixion ===
[[File:Pompeii - Casa dei Vettii - Ixion.jpg|thumb|Close up of the Punishment of Ixion in the House of the Vettii in Pompeii|193x193px]]
This mythological scene is located on the east wall of the north triclinium, which is located next to the large peristyle. This mythological scene shows the moment of [[Ixion]], the Lapith King, being punished for betraying [[Zeus]]. After being welcomed into Olympus by the god, Ixion grew to lust after Zeus's wife, [[Hera]]. After attempting to seduce her, Zeus creates the cloud goddess [[Nephele]] in the image of Hera. Ixion lays with Nephele and their union creates the [[centaur]]s. As punishment, Zeus banishes Ixion from Olympus and orders [[Hermes]] to tie Ixion to a [[Wheel of fire|winged fiery wheel]], which is to spin for eternity.

In this scene, Ixion is bound to the wheel and Hermes stands in the forefront, identifiable by his winged sandals and [[caduceus]]. [[Hephaestus]] stands behind the wheel, one hand resting on the wheel to set it into motion. Hermes, however, also has one hand on the wheel keeping it still as he looks to Hera. Hera is enthroned to the right, holding a long golden scepter and wearing a golden crown. Beside her is her messenger, Iris, extending her arm to present to Hera Ixion's punishment. Hera pulls aside her thin veil to watch the scene. A young woman sits next to Hermes with one hand up. She is identified by scholars as either Ixion's mother or Nephele.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Paintings of the Casa Dei Vettii in Pompei|last=Archer|first=William|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses|year=1981|isbn=|location=|pages=400–401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Daedalus and Pasiphae ===

Daedalus and Pasiphae in the House of the Vettii in Pompeii. 
]]
The mythological scene, Daedalus and Pasiphae is located on the north wall of the same triclinium where the Punishment of Ixion is depicted. This scene depicts King Minos's wife, [[Pasiphaë|Pasiphae]], and the craftsman [[Daedalus]], whom Pasiphae ordered to construct a cow so she could sleep with her husbands treasured bull. Her lust towards the bull was a consequence of [[Minos|King Minos]] refusing to sacrifice the bull to [[Poseidon]], angering the god who punished King Minos by making Pasiphae lust after the bull. Pasiphae later becomes pregnant with the [[Minotaur]]. Daedalus and his son [[Icarus]] were punished through imprisonment by King Minos for his assistance, leading into the famous myth of a winged escape from Crete.

Depicted in this scene is Daedalus presenting to Pasiphae the wooden cow. Daedalus is positioned in the middle of the painting with his back turned. He places one hand on the wooden cow and gestures with his other hand, explaining the cow to Pasiphae and her entourage. Pasiphae is seated to the left with two attendants behind her. all three figures look past Daedalus, focusing on an area above the cow. One attendant points to the opening in the cow's back. A young boy sits to the left of Daedalus, either an apprentice or Icarus. The boy raises a hammer in his right hand and holds a chisel in his left, placed against the wooden beam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Paintings of the Casa dei Vettii in Pompeii|last=Archer|first=William|publisher=|year=1981|isbn=|location=|pages=413–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dionysus discovering Ariadne ===
The final mythological scene in the north triclinium is Dionysus discovering Ariadne on the south wall. The scene of [[Dionysus|Dionysis]] discovering [[Ariadne]] was a popular theme in Greek vase paining. It depicts the moment Dionysus discovers Ariadne, the daughter of King Minos and Pasiphae. After being abandoned by [[Theseus]], the slayer of the Minotaur, Dionysus finds her sleeping on the island of [[Naxos]] and weds her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Severy-Hoven|first=Beth|date=November 2012|title=Master Narratives and the Wall Painting of the House of the Vettii, Pompei|url=|journal=Gender &amp; History|volume= 24 (no. 3)|pages=549|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scene Ariadne lays on a large leopard skin, with her back to the viewer. She wears gold armlets and anklets, tiny blue flowers in her hair, and a yellow mantle with a light-blue border. The mantle is wrapped around her legs and pulled up towards her front. Her back and bottom are nude. She leans against a white pillow with her right elbow and her left arm rests on top of her head, her fingers touching her upper right arm. The god of sleep, [[Hypnos]], stands to the right of the image, besides Ariadne's pillow. He holds a branch over Ariadne to sprinkle water from a small gold dish in his left hand, inducing sleep. Hypnos is winged and garbed in a green undergarment with long sleeves, a light-blue band around his head, and brown boots with a gold lion on the upper edge. To the left of the image, Dionysus stands in poor condition. From what is able to be deduced, Dionysis stands at a slight three-quarter view, wearing ivy leaves in his hair and a long red mantle that leaves his front exposed. He gazes down at Ariadne, a tall [[Thyrsus|thyrsos]] in his left hand. The thyrsos has a circular cluster of leaves and a gold eagle with outsretched wings. Next to Dionysus are three [[satyr]]s, two to his right and one to his left. Two [[maenad]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are possibly depicted in the painting. One is depicted to the right of Dionysus, wearing a long green garment and leaves in the hair. he maenad looks towards Ariadne. The other is to the right of Ariadne, looking over her shoulder. In the center a satyr lifts an edge of Ariadne's mantle and gestures to her exposed body. Cupid is depicted in the lower right corner with his hands clasped around his right leg as he gazes at Ariadne. In the left hand corner are a red and blue tambourine and two small gold cymbals. A seascape is depicted in the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Paintings of the Casa Dei Vettii in Pompeii|last=William|first=Archer|publisher=Pro Quest Dissertations and Theses|year=1981|isbn=|pages=434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene depicts [[Pentheus]], the legendary King of Thebes, being killed by the female followers of Dionysus. When Dionysus returned to [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], Pentheus refused to believe Dionysus divinity as a god and imprisoned him, banning his worship. Dionysus escaped and enchanted Pentheus to go to Mt. Cithairon, disguised as a [[maenad]]. There he observed the celebration of the cult of Dionysus by the women of Thebes. In attendance was Pentheus' mother [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]] and her sisters [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]] and [[Autonoë|Autonoe]]. The women discovered Pentheus, hidden behind a pine tree, but mistook him as a lion. The women then attacked Pentheus, tearing him to pieces.

In the scene depicted, Pentheus' mother and her sisters have discovered Pentheus and have begun to tear him apart. In the front is Pentheus who has fallen to one knee. His left hand is raised to his head and his right is stretched outwards with his palm facing up. To his right he stares at a maenead who has her foot on his left knee and grasps his hair with her left hand. She raises a [[Thyrsus|thyrsos]] in her right hand to strike him with. To his left is another maenaed who grabs his left arm with both hands and leans back to pull him back. Below Pentheus is a spear. Behind him are three other females. The center maenaed holds a stone above her head, about to hurl it at Pentheus. Two [[Erinyes|erinys]] are in each upper hand corner. The erinys in the left corner raises a whip to strike Pentheus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Paintings of the Casa dei Vetti in Pompeii|last=Archer|first=William|publisher=|year=1981|isbn=|location=|pages=434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cithairon, but they were found by a shepherd who took them in. As punishment, Lykos imprisoned Antiope and allowed his wife, Dirce, to treat her cruelly. Eventually Antiope escaped and reunited with her now adult sons but was recaptured by Dirce, who ordered that Antiope be put to death by being dragged by a bull. Amphion and Zethus saved their mother and killed Dirce in the same manner she was going to have their mother put to death.

The final mythological scene in the south-east triclinium is Achilles on Skyros, painted on the east wall. This scene depicts [[Achilles]] stay on the island of [[Skyros]]. After learning that Achilles would die during the [[Trojan War]], his mother, [[Thetis]], sent him to live on the island of Skyros. Achilles was disguised as a maiden among [[Lycomedes|Lykomedes]] daughters. While living on Skyros, [[Deidamia II of Epirus|Deidameia]] bore Achilles a son.

=== Hero and Leander ===
On the south wall in the cubiculum is the painting Hero and Leander. This painting depicts the lovers [[Hero and Leander]] who lived on opposite shores of the [[Dardanelles|Hellespont]]. Leander wished to be with his lover so he swam the strait each night, guided by torches Hero placed in a tower on the beach. One night a storm extinguishes the light, causing Leander to drown.

He extends his left arm toward Leander and holds a lantern, which is resting on the rock beside him. A dark garment is draped over a rock to the left of the servant, most likely Leander's clothes. At the base of the scene a ladder is leaned against a rock near the servant. To the right are horizontal planks creating a bridge, leading to the second step of the tower platform. Three dolphins swim above Leander in the composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Paintings of the Casa dei Vetti in Pompeii|last=Archer|first=William|publisher=|year=1981|isbn=|location=|pages=548–549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Owners ==
[[File:Scene of sacrifice in honour of Diana. Fresco from the triclinium of House of the Vettii in Pompeii.jpg|thumb|An ancient [[Pompeian Styles|Fourth-Pompeian-Style]] [[Roman art|Roman wall painting]] depicting a scene of sacrifice in honor of the [[goddess Diana]]; she is seen here accompanied by a deer. The fresco was discovered in the [[triclinium]] of House of the Vettii in [[Pompeii]], Italy.]]
It has been determined by scholars that the House of the Vettii was owned by Aulus Vettius Conviva and Aulus Vettius Restitutus, former slaves or freedman. Scholars have come to this conclusion after finding the names on two bronze seals located in the front hall. One of the seals was engraved with 'A. Vetti Restituti' or 'of Aulus Vettius Restitutus'. On the other 'A. Vetti Convivaes [sic]' orr 'of Aulus Vettius Conviva' was carved into the seal. Additionally, a ring was found with the initials A. V. C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Severy-Hoven|first=Beth|date=November 2012|title=Master Narratives and the Wall Painting of the House of the Vetti, Pompei|url=|journal=Gender &amp; History|volume=24|pages=545|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence supports the identification of the owners through wax tablets and notices pasted on the outside of the house. Preserved business tablets of Lucius Caecillius list A. Vettius Conviva as a witness. The tablet identifies Conviva as a free man. Other proofs of Conviva's position in Roman society, and incidentally his ownership of the House of the Vettii, are found in the form of graffiti. On the southern facade of the house, he is identified as an Augustalis, a type of priest, which is mirrored in fragments of a seal ring that was abbreviated with 'Aug' following his name. Scholars, however, have noted that it cannot be stated with certainty that the Vettii are the owners, despite most believing that they were, due to the limited epigraphical (engraved) evidence. The Vetti family is believed to have been freedman of the aristocratic family. This belief is rooted in the cognomina, or third given name, Conviva and Restitutus being associated with servitude as well as the richness of the decorations in the House of the Vettii. Furthermore, the position of Augustalis was often held by former slaves. The name 'Restitutus' was also commonly a slave name. Scholars have debated the relationship of the two men, many believing they were brothers or fellow slaves. Other theories suggest that Conviva owned the home and Restitutus was a son, brother or freedman, or another important member of the household that inherited the house upon Conviva's passing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Paintings of the Casa dei Vettii in Pompeii|last=Archer|first=William|publisher=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kahramana''' is a fountain located in Baghdad's Sa'adoon Street depicting a scene from the legend of ''[[Ali Baba]] and the Forty Thieves''; a story taken from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' in which the slave girl Marjana outwitted the thieves by tricking them into hiding inside jars over which she poured hot oil. The statue was officially opened in 1971 and was the work of the Iraqi sculptor, [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]]. It has become one of Baghdad's most iconic public artworks. In the aftermath of the US-led invasion of 2003, the work assumed new meanings for the Iraqi people. 

==Background==
From 1969 when Iraq became a republic and the  [[Hashemite]] monarchy was overthrown, leading artists and sculptors were commissioned to produce artworks that would beautify the city of Baghdad, glorify Iraq's ancient past and contribute to a sense of national identity. During this period, sculptors including [[Khaled al-Rahal]], [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]] executed a number of high profile public monuments which are now dotted around the city of Baghdad. &lt;ref&gt;al-Kalil, S., ''Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq.'' Berkeley, University of California Press, pp 72-75; Shabout, N., "The "Free" art of Occupation: Images for a "New" Iraq," ''Arab Studies Quarterly,'' Vol. 28, No. 3/4 2006, pp. 41-53; Brown, B.A. and Feldman, M.H. (eds), ''Critical Approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Art,''Walter de Gruyter, 2014 p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, who was commissioned to construct ''Kahramana'', was a well-known Iraqi sculptor, whose public works were on display throughout Baghdad's streetscapes and urban spaces. His works achieved popularity because they depicted scenes from the everyday life of Baghdad's people and also drew on Iraqi folklore.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, T., "Mohammed Ghani Hikmat," [Biographical Notes], Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohammed-Ghani-Hikmat.aspx Online:] &lt;/ref&gt; Many of Ghani's early sculptures were inspired by Iraqi folklore, especially characters from  [[One Thousand and One Nights]] (widely known as the ''Tales of Arabian Nights'').&lt;ref name=google&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/mohammed-ghani-hikmats-87th-birthday|title= Mohammed Ghani Hikmat’s 87th birthday|date=20 April 2016| access-date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early works were figurative and included statues of ''Sinbad, the Sailor;'' the 10th-century poet, ''[[Al-Mutanabbi]]''; the first Abassid Caliph, ''[[Al-Mansur|Abu-Ja'afar Mansur]]'' (in stone); ''[[Hammurabi]]'' (in bronze) and ''[[Gilgamesh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; As Ghani matured, his work became increasingly  abstract, but he never lost sight of the need to reference Iraq's ancient art traditions through the use of Arabic script, geometric designs, and Sumerian architectural features.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, pp 73-75&lt;/ref&gt; 

His most well-known works include a pair of statues of ''[[Scheherazade|Queen Scheherazade]] and [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryār|King Shahryar]]'', located on the banks of the Tigris River, near Abu Nuwas Street and the ''Fountain of Kahramana'' in the central business district.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, M.S., "Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, Iraqi Sculptor, Dies at 82", ''New York Times,'' 21 September, 2011, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/arts/design/mohammed-ghani-hikmat-iraqi-sculptor-dies-at-82.html Online:]; "Artist and Sculptor Mohamed Ghani Hikmat", ''Al Jazeera News'' 15 September, 2011, [http://www.aljazeera.net/news/cultureandart/2011/9/15/%D8%BA%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%AD%D8%AA Online:] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Built in the late 1960s and inaugurated in 1971, the fountain was inspired by the story of ''Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves'' from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' and the slave girl, Marjana (or Morgiana), who outwitted the thieves. The story relates how the slave girl persuaded thieves, who had come to attack her master, to hide in storage jars. She then pours boiling oil into the jars to kill the thieves. As a mark of his gratitude, Ali Baba grants Marjana her freedom and she ultimately marries Ali Baba's son. &lt;ref&gt;Shadid, A, ''Night Draws Near: Iraq's People in the Shadow of America's War,'' Henry Holt and Company, 2006, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fountain depicts the slave girl standing over 40 jars, ready to pour the hot oil. It was cast in bronze, stands 3.3 metres in height and is situated in Kahramana Square, Sa'adoon Street, Baghdad. As the girl pours the water, a series of lilting fountains cascades downward towards the base of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 74 and p.42; Shabout, N., "Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cascading water contributed to the monument's grandeur, but the water was turned off during the Iran-Iraq war and the fountain fell into a state of disrepair, with overgrown verges and the base of the fountain filled with litter. Its storage jars were painted green, a colour that drew the disapproval of the sculptor. &lt;ref&gt;Omar, M., ''Barefoot in Baghdad: A Story of Identity-My Own and What It Means to Be a Woman in Chaos'' Sourcebooks, 2010, [E-book edition] n.p.; Shadid, A., ''The Washington Post Pulitzers: Anthony Shadid, International Reporting,'' The Washington Post and Diversion Books, 2014  [E-book edition] n.p.; ''Night Draws Near: Shadid, A., ''Iraq's People in the Shadow of America's War'', Henry Holt and Company, 2006 [E-book edition] n.p.; Antoon, S., "Living With Death in Baghdad", ''New York Times'', 20  July, 2016 [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/opinion/living-with-death-in-baghdad.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the US-led invasion of 2003, some of Hikmat's work took on new meanings and new political interpretations emerged from Iraq's destruction. At the time, the Iraqis saw that the work represented the  new reality of their country and the number '40' became charged with meaning. The Provisional Governing Council, after the occupation, included forty people, which came to symoblise the forty thieves; and the decisions of the Iraqi civil administrator, [[Paul Bremer]], consisted of 53 resolutions, with Resolution No. 40 referring to the dissolution of the Iraqi army.&lt;ref&gt;"Mohammed Ghani Hikmat: Baghdad Recalls its Sculptor" ''AlAraby'' 22 September 2015[https://www.alaraby.co.uk/culture/2015/9/22/%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%BA%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D8%BA%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%B1-%D9%86%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7 Online:] (translated from Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; This resolution, which left some 400,000 Iraqi soldiers without employment, led to public protests and the Kahramana fountain became a popular starting point for public demonstrations and civil rights campaigners.&lt;ref&gt;Sulaymaniyah "Kahramana Week for Women Across Baghdad", ''Iraqi Civil Society'', 11

'''Khyad''' village is in [[Badami]] taluk in [[Bagalkot District]] in [[North Karnataka]], popular for prehistoric structures, 
found many fossils of prehistoric ''Stone Age''. 

In 1873 Robert Bruise (researcher) discovered this area.
From [[Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute|Deccan College]] Pune many researchers, archaeologists and students undertook research and found information related to prehistoric era. In association with Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) - Mysore division excavation department, the research students from Delhi discovered several stone weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Kozarčanka - Milja Marin.jpg|thumb|''Kozarčanka'' by Žorž Skrigin. The subject of the photo is Milja Marin (''née'' Toroman).]]
'''''Kozarčanka''''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Козарчанка}}, meaning "Woman from [[Kozara]]") is a [[World War II]] photograph that became iconic in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Shot by Yugoslav artistic photographer Žorž Skrigin in northern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] during the winter of 1943–44, it shows a smiling female [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] wearing a [[Titovka (cap)|Titovka cap]] and with a rifle slung over her shoulder.

The subject of the portrait is '''Milja Marin''' (''née'' Toroman), a [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] from a village at the foot of Mount Kozara. Shortly after the war, she married a fellow Partisan and lived in the town of [[Prijedor]]; she died in 2007 at the age of&amp;nbsp;81. ''Kozarčanka'' was featured in widely circulated school textbooks, war monographs and posters, as well as on the cover of an album by a well-known Yugoslav pop band. Marin's identity as the subject of the photograph was not widely known in Socialist Yugoslavia.

==Background==
In April 1941, the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]], occupied and dismembered by the [[Axis powers]], led by [[Nazi Germany]]. A [[Fascism|fascist]] [[puppet state]] known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (''Nezavisna država Hrvatska'' or NDH) was proclaimed on 10&amp;nbsp;April, and included almost all of modern-day [[Croatia]], all of modern-day [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and parts of modern-day [[Serbia]].{{sfn|Roberts|1987|pp=15–19}} Led by the [[Croatian nationalism|Croatian nationalist]] [[Ustaše]] movement, one of the NDH's policies was to [[World War II persecution of Serbs|eliminate the state's ethnic Serb population]] with mass killings, expulsions and forced assimilation.{{sfn|Vucinich|1949|pp=355–358}} Resistance movements were soon created in response to the occupation, one of which was organised by the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist Party of Yugoslavia]]. Headed by [[Josip Broz Tito]], the Party decided on 4&amp;nbsp;July to launch a nationwide armed uprising and the members of the forces under its leadership became known as [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]];{{sfn|Roberts|1987|pp=20–24}} they were also referred to as the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia. In December 1943 and January 1944, the 11th Krajina Brigade of the National Liberation Army was attacking the Germans and Ustaše in the area of [[Kozara|Mount Kozara]], in northern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], to relieve pressure from the Partisans in [[Banija]] and eastern Bosnia, where the Axis were conducting [[Operation Kugelblitz|major anti-Partisan offensives]].{{sfn|Milinović|Karasijević|1982|pp=141, 165, 186}}

==Photograph and its subject==
During the winter of 1943–44, the travelling troop of the Theatre of National Liberation encountered a column of Partisans from the 11th Krajina Brigade in the region of [[Knešpolje]], in the [[Kozara]] area. The head of the theatre's [[ballet]] section was Georgij "Žorž" Skrigin, a Yugoslav ballet dancer of Russian origin.{{sfn|Index.hr|16 November 2007|loc=para. 1–4}}{{sfn|Arsenev|2012|loc=para. 1–3}}{{sfn|Todić|2013|p=40}} Skrigin was also an internationally acclaimed artistic photographer, and had received prestigious awards at a number of photography exhibitions during the late 1930s.{{sfn|Arsenev|2012|loc=para. 1–3}} Between 1942 and 1945, Skrigin took around 500 [[War photography|war photographs]], some of which would become legendary in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Socialist Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Malić|1997|p=29}} The commander of the 11th Krajina Brigade was also present in the column, and Skrigin asked him to photograph a female Partisan fighter. The commander selected five young nurses from the column, among whom Skrigin chose seventeen-year-old Milja Toroman.{{sfn|Index.hr|16 November 2007|loc=para. 1–4}}{{sfn|Kovačević|2007|loc=para. 1–7}} She was a [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] from the village of [[Brekinja]] near [[Dubica, Bosnia-Herzegovina|Dubica]], at the foot of Mount Kozara.{{sfn|Lukić|1984|p=36}} Skrigin put a [[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]] on her, slung a rifle over her shoulder, tilted her [[red star]]-emblazoned [[Titovka (cap)|Titovka cap]] to the side of her head, smoothed her hair, and told her to smile.{{sfn|Kovačević|2007|loc=para. 1–7}} He then photographed her with his [[Rolleiflex]] camera.{{sfn|Malić|1997|p=29}}

In his war photographs, Skrigin united two divergent principles: harsh realism, content-wise, and [[pictorialism]], form-wise.{{sfn|Malić|1997|p=29}} In 1968, he published a monograph on his war photography, titled ''Rat i pozornica'' (''War and Stage''), in which the photograph of Milja Toroman is titled ''Kozarčanka'' (''Woman from Kozara''). The caption carries a legend, which does not mention her name: "As a young woman she was captured during the First Enemy Offensive. She succeeded in escaping—even from Germany—and reached Kozara, where she became a fighter of the Kozara forces." Author Natascha Vittorelli describes ''Kozarčanka'' as follows:{{sfn|Vittorelli|2015|pp=126–30}}
{{quote|The young woman wears her shoulder-length hair loose, a thick cardigan, a five-pointed [star on her] side cap—and a rifle. She appears healthy, reposed, and good-humored, her clothes are neat and tidy. The glance over her shoulder reinforces the dynamics of her gesture, the bright smile communicates confidence and optimism, even joy and enthusiasm; the dangers and exertions of war seem remote, the victory near. Quite relaxed she seems to go to a war, which promises adventure and gender equality&amp;nbsp;... The tension between woman and weapon emphasizes the femininity of the young Partisan, but despite the rifle she rather radiates harmlessness than harassment; her girlishness undermines the provocation the female Partisan implies.{{sfn|Vittorelli|2015|pp=126–30}}}}

[[File:Žorž Skrigin (1943).jpg|thumb|Žorž Skrigin, self-portrait (1943)]]
Shortly after the war, in 1946, Milja Toroman married Pero Marin,{{sfn|Index.hr|16 November 2007|loc=para. 1–4}} who had fought with the Partisans since the uprising in Kozara in late July 1941.{{sfn|Kovačević|2007|loc=para. 1–7}}{{sfn|Ćurguz|Vignjević|1982|p=218}} The couple lived in [[Prijedor]], the largest city in the area, and had five children. In an interview she gave in 2007, Milja explained that she did not feel like smiling at the time the photograph was taken because of the war-related hardships that she and her family had endured. Nevertheless, she acquiesced to Skrigin's request and gave a bright smile.{{sfn|Kovačević|2007|loc=para. 1–7}} Marin also stated that she had never carried a gun before the photograph, nor after.{{sfn|Vittorelli|2015|pp=126–30}} She died on 11&amp;nbsp;November 2007, at the age of&amp;nbsp;81.{{sfn|Index.hr|16 November 2007|loc=para. 1–4}}

==Legacy==
After the war, in which the National Liberation Army was victorious, ''Kozarčanka'' became an iconic wartime portrait in Socialist Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Vittorelli|2015|pp=126–30}}{{sfn|Batinić|2015|pp=}} It was one of the symbols of the mass participation of women as volunteers in the Partisan struggle, which was thus additionally legitimated as a cause of the whole Yugoslav nation.{{sfn|Vittorelli|2015|pp=126–30}} The official narrative of the Partisan struggle promoted by Yugoslavia's post-war government, led by Tito, served to legitimize the regime and create a common national sentiment in the multi-ethnic country. The female Partisans held a significant place in this narrative.{{sfn|Batinić|2015|pp=}} ''Kozarčanka'' was featured in widely circulated school textbooks, as well as  war monographs and posters.{{sfn|Kovačević|2007|loc=para. 1–7}}{{sfn|Todić|2013|pp=45–46}} The mass icon glorified the beauty and enthusiasm of a revolutionary.{{sfn|Todić|2013|pp=45–46}} A modified version of ''Kozarčanka'' (without the rifle) appeared on the [[album cover|cover]] of a [[Teško meni sa tobom (a još teže bez tebe)|1986 album]] by the Yugoslav pop band [[Dino Merlin|Merlin]]. The rear of the cover  featured a photograph of the actress [[Marilyn Monroe]].{{sfn|Vittorelli|2015|pp=126–30}} For the mythical aura surrounding the heroine represented in ''Kozarčanka'', any exact knowledge about her was unnecessary and could even be damaging. Her identity thus remained mostly unknown to the general public until after the [[Revolutions of 1989|Fall of Communism]] in Yugoslavia and other European countries, when the photograph's ideological message became irrelevant.{{sfn|Todić|2013|pp=45–46}}

[[File:Sarnath capital.jpg|thumb|The original Lion Capital. Minus the [[inverted bell]]-shaped [[Indian lotus|lotus]] flower, this has been adopted as the [[National Emblem of India]], seen from another angle, showing the horse on the left and the bull on the right of the [[Ashoka Chakra]] in the circular base on which the four [[Indian lion]]s are standing back to back. On the side shown here there are the bull and elephant; a lion occupies the other place. The wheel "Ashoka Chakra" from its base has been placed onto the centre of the [[National Flag of India]].]]

The '''Lion  Capital of Ashoka''' is a sculpture of four [[Asiatic lion]]s standing back to back, on an elaborate base that includes other animals. A graphic representation of it was adopted as the official [[Emblem of India]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=9 State Emblem], Know India india.gov.in&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally placed on the top of the [[Pillars of Ashoka|Ashoka pillar]] at the important [[Buddhist]] site of [[Sarnath]] by the [[Emperor Ashoka]], in about 250 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarnathindia.com/lion-capital-of-ashoka.html|title=Sarnath site|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pillar, sometimes called the Aśoka Column, is still in its original location, but the Lion Capital is now in the [[Sarnath Museum]], in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]]. Standing 2.15 metres (7 feet) high including the base, it is more elaborate  than the other very similar surviving capitals of the pillars of [[Ashoka]] bearing the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] that were placed throughout India several of which feature single animals at the top; one  other damaged group of four lions survives, at [[Sanchi]].&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] is carved out of  a single block of polished [[sandstone]], and was always a separate piece from the column itself. It features four [[Asiatic lions|Asiatic Lions]] standing back to back. They are mounted on an [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] with a  [[frieze]] carrying sculptures in high [[relief]] of an [[elephant]], a galloping [[horse]], a [[bull]], and a lion, separated by intervening spoked chariot-wheels. The whole sits upon a bell-shaped [[Indian lotus|lotus]]. The capital was originally probably crowned by a 'Wheel of [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]]' (''[[Dharmachakra]]'' popularly known in India as the "[[Ashoka Chakra]]"), with 24 spokes, of which a few fragments were found on the site.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, caption at start of Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; A 13th-century replica of the Sarnath pillar and capital in [[Wat Umong]] near [[Chiang Mai]], [[Thailand]] built by King [[Mangrai]], preserves its crowning Ashoka Chakra or Dharmachakra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thailandsworld.com/index.cfm?p=286 |title=Wat Umong Chiang Mai |website=Thailand's World |accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wheel on the capital, below the lions, is the model for the one in the [[flag of India]].

==Art history==
[[File:Sarnath Ashoka Capital Horse motif.jpg|thumb|The horse motif on the capital.]]
Currently seven animal sculptures from Ashoka pillars survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3s9BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123|title=The Return of the Buddha: Ancient Symbols for a New Nation|page=123|publisher=Routledge|author=Himanshu Prabha Ray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Companion to Asian Art and Architecture|page=423-429|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|author=Rebecca M. Brown, Deborah S. Hutton}}&lt;/ref&gt; These form "the first important group of Indian stone sculpture", though it is thought they derive from an existing tradition of wooden columns topped by animal sculptures in [[copper]], none of which have survived. There has been much discussion of the extent of influence from [[Achaemenid Persia]], where the column capitals supporting the roofs at [[Persepolis]] have similarities, and the "rather cold, hieratic style" of the Sarnath sculptures especially shows "obvious Achaemenid and [[Sargon II|Sargonid]] influence".&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 22, 24, quoted in turn; Companion, 429-430&lt;/ref&gt;

Very similar four-lion sculptures are on the capitals of the two columns supporting the south [[torana]] of the Ashokan or [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahana]] enclosure wall round the Great [[Stupa]] at Sanchi.  Like other Ashoka pillars, the one at Sarnath was probably erected to commemorate a visit by the emperor.

==Rediscovery==
[[File:AshokaLions.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The Lion Capital on the ground at Sarnath, probably 1904-05]]
There were no surviving traces above ground of the Sarnath pillar, mentioned in the accounts of medieval Chinese pilgrims, when the Indian Civil Service engineer [[F.O. Oertel]], with no real experience in archaeology, was allowed to excavate there in the winter of 1904-05.  He first uncovered the remains of a [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] shrine west of the main [[stupa]], overlying an Ashokan structure.  To the west of that he found the lowest section of the pillar, upright but broken off near ground level. Most of the rest of the pillar was found in three sections nearby, and then, since the Sanchi capital had been excavated in 1851, the search for an equivalent was continued, and it was found close by.  It was both finer in execution and in much better condition than that at Sanchi.  The pillar appeared to have been deliberately destroyed at some point.  The finds were recognised as so important that the first onsite museum in India (and one of the few then in the world) was set up to house them.&lt;ref name="Allen, Chapter 15"&gt;Allen, Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
[[File:India 1947 Ashoka Lions 1 and half annas.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The second stamp of independent India and the first for domestic use.&lt;ref name="Phil"&gt;''India Postage Stamps 1947-1988''.(1989) Philately branch, Department of Posts, India.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SS"&gt;Souvenir sheet of the ''Independence'' series of stamps, Indian Posts, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;]]

What is being preached may be symbolised by the group of four lions of the capital. A group of four lions joined back to back symbolizes a group of four things of equal importance. The lion is frequently used as a symbol of the [[Buddha]], as at Sanchi, and the animals on the abacus below also have symbolic meaning in Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Allen, Chapter 15"/&gt; The capital is clearly [[Buddhist]] and [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] in origin and thus probably symbolizes the spread of [[Dharma]], and perhaps the extent of the Maurya Empire in all directions, or four parts of the empire. Alternatively, the group of four lions and bell jointly symbolize preaching of 'the Four Noble Truths' of Buddhism to all; those that emphasize the Middle Path. The symbol U with a vertical line placed symmetrically inside it symbolizes 'The Middle Path'. The Middle Path is the fundamental philosophy of Buddhism, the Buddhist Dharma. 
[[Image:Emblem of India.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[National Emblem of India]]]]
A further clue could be the cylindrical portion of the Lion Capital. On the wall of the cylinder the bull, the horse, the Lion and the Elephant all in the moving position are being placed in between the Chakras. These could symbolize Bull, Lion, Horse and Elephant rolling the Chakras.

A study of the ancient coins and other archaeological finds of India and [[Sri Lanka]] reveals the fact that Buddha had been symbolized with a Horse, Lion, Bull, Elephant and a pair of feet. The Tamil epic [[Manimekalai]] mentions worship of a pair of feet. Pairs of feet made of stone had been discovered in [[Jaffna Peninsula]], [[Anuradhapura]] and in a number of places of [[Tamil Nadu]].In a number of Buddhist inscriptions of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka, a pair of feet had been symbolized with a pair of fish or a pair of conch shells. In this way the symbols sculpted in the cylindrical portion of the Lion Capital represents Buddha rolling the Dhamma Chakra; that is, Preaching the Dhamma.

As [[Theravada]] Buddhism rejects symbolization of Buddha and Buddhism, the Lion Capital may be claimed as one of the finest sculptures of the main tradition that developed into [[Mahayana]] Buddhism several centuries later.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Government act==
Whenever the emblem is used by state governments or any other government body, the words [[Satyameva Jayate]] ("Truth alone triumphs") in [[Devanagari]] script (सत्यमेव जयते) has to be used right under the emblem as per the statute, State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/36040918.cms|title=Has Telangana government got the emblem wrong?|work=The Economic Times|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarities with the Sanchi capital==
[[File:Sanchi capital frontal view before-after reconstitution.jpg|thumb|The [[capital (architecture)|capital]] of the Sanchi pillar of [[Ashoka]], as discovered (left), and simulation of original appearance (right).&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Sanchi pillar of Ashoka.jpg|Drawing reconstruction by F.C. Maisey for reference]]&lt;/ref&gt; 250 BCE.&lt;ref name="p.25-28 Ashoka pillar"&gt;Described in Marshall [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.532798 p.25-28 Ashoka pillar].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{see also|Pillars of Ashoka}}

A pillar of finely polished sandstone, one of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], was also erected on the side of the main [[Torana]] gateway at [[Sanchi]]. The bell-shaped capital consists of four lions, which probably supported a [[Wheel of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Architecture by Huu Phuoc Le [https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA155 p.155]&lt;/ref&gt; The capital is located at the nearby [[Sanchi Archaeological Museum]]. The capital is rather similar to the Sarnath capital, except that it is surmounted by an [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] and a crowning ornament of four lions, set back to back, the whole finely finished and polished to a remarkable luster from top to bottom. The abacus is adorned with four [[flame palmette]] designs separated one from the other by pairs of [[geese]], symbolical perhaps of the flock of the Buddha's disciples. The lions from the summit, though now quite disfigured, still testify to the skills of the sculptors.&lt;ref name="Marshall 90"&gt;Marshall, "A Guide to Sanchi" [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.459148 p.90ff] Public Domain text&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="165633">This is a '''list of video game publisher''' companies. A [[video game publisher]] may specialize in only publishing games for [[video game developer|developers]], or may either have in-house development studios or own [[subsidiary]] development companies. Some developers may publish their [[video game|games]] themselves.

This list includes both active and inactive companies. Active publishers are either run independently or as a subsidiary of another company. Inactive publishers may either be defunct outright or still exist but no longer involved in video game publishing.

{{Wikisource|The Triumphal Song of Merneptah}}

The '''Merneptah Stele'''—also known as the '''Israel Stele''' or the '''Victory Stele of Merneptah'''—is an inscription by the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh|king]] [[Merneptah]] (reign: 1213 to 1203 BC) discovered by [[Flinders Petrie]] in 1896 at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], and now housed in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]].{{sfn |Drower|1985|p=221}}{{sfn |Redmount|2001|pp=71–72, 97}}

The text is largely an account of Merneptah's victory over the Libyans and their allies, but the last 3 of the 28 lines deal with a separate campaign in [[Canaan]], then part of Egypt's imperial possessions. The stele is sometimes referred to as the "Israel Stela" because a majority of scholars translate a set of hieroglyphs in line 27 as "Israel." Alternative translations have been advanced but are not widely accepted.&lt;ref name="Sparks1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenton L. Sparks|title=Ethnicity and Identity in Ancient Israel: Prolegomena to the Study of Ethnic Sentiments and Their Expression in the Hebrew Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KztVonFGqcsC&amp;pg=PA96|year=1998|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-1-57506-033-0|pages=96–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stela represents the earliest textual reference to Israel and the only reference from ancient Egypt.{{sfn|Hasel|1998|p=194}} It is one of four known inscriptions, from the Iron Age,  that date to the time of and mention [[ancient Israel]], under this name,  the others being the [[Mesha Stele]], the [[Tel Dan Stele]], and the [[Kurkh Monolith]].{{sfn|Lemche|1998|pp=46, 62|ps=: “No other inscription from Palestine, or from Transjordan in the Iron Age, has so far provided any specific reference to Israel... The name of Israel was found in only a very limited number of inscriptions, one from Egypt, another separated by at least 250 years from the first, in Transjordan. A third reference is found in the stele from Tel Dan - if it is genuine, a question not yet settled. The Assyrian and Mesopotamian sources only once mentioned a king of Israel, Ahab, in a spurious rendering of the name.”}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maeir|first=Aren|year=|title=Maeir, A. M. 2013.

Thereafter, no reference to either Judah or Israel appears until the ninth century. The pharaoh Sheshonq I (biblical Shishak; see SHESHONQ I–VI) mentions neither entity by name in the inscription recording his campaign in the southern Levant during the late tenth century. In the ninth century, Israelite kings, and possibly a Judaean king, are mentioned in several sources: the Aramaean stele from Tel Dan, inscriptions of SHALMANESER III of Assyria, and the stela of Mesha of Moab. From the early eighth century onward, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah are both mentioned somewhat regularly in Assyrian and subsequently Babylonian sources, and from this point on there is relatively good agreement between the biblical accounts on the one hand and the archaeological evidence and extra-biblical texts on the other.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=FLEMING|first=DANIEL E.|date=1998-01-01|year=|title=MARI AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF BIBLICAL MEMORY|jstor=23282083|journal=Revue d'Assyriologie et d'archéologie orientale|volume=92|issue=1|pages=41–78|quote=The Assyrian royal annals, along with the Mesha and Dan inscriptions, show a thriving northern state called Israël in the mid—9th century, and the continuity of settlement back to the early Iron Age suggests that the establishment of a sedentary identity should be associated with this population, whatever their origin.

==Description and context==
[[File:Petrie 1897 plate14.png|thumb|left|150px|[[Flinders Petrie]]'s 1897 mirror image copy of the main part of the inscription (all 28 lines)]]
The stele was discovered in 1896 by [[Flinders Petrie]] in the ancient Egyptian capital of Thebes, and first translated by [[Wilhelm Spiegelberg]]. In his "Inscriptions" chapter of Petrie's 1897 publication "Six Temples at Thebes", Spiegelberg described the stele as "engraved on the rough back of the stele of [[Amenhotep III]], which was removed from his temple, and placed back outward, against the wall, in the forecourt of the temple of Merneptah. Owing to the rough surface, and the poor cutting, the readings in many places require careful examination... The scene at the top retains its original colouring of yellow, red, and blue. [[Amun|Amen]] is shown giving a sword to the king, who is backed by [[Mut]] on one side and by [[Khonsu]] on the other".{{sfn| Petrie|Spiegelberg |1897|p=[https://archive.org/stream/sixtemplesattheb00petruoft#page/26/mode/1up 26]}}

Now in the collection of the [[Egyptian Museum]] at [[Cairo]], the stele is a black granite slab, over 3 meters (10 feet) high, and the inscription says it was carved in the 5th year of Merneptah of the 19th dynasty. Most of the text glorifies Merneptah's victories over enemies from Libya and their Sea People allies, but the final two lines mention a campaign in Canaan, where Merneptah says he defeated and destroyed Ashkalon, Gezer, Yanoam and Israel.

Egypt was the dominant power in the region during the long reign of Merneptah's predecessor, [[Ramesses the Great]], but Merneptah and one of his nearest successors, [[Ramesses III]], faced major invasions. The problems began in Merneptah's 5th year (1208), when a Libyan king invaded Egypt from the west in alliance with various northern peoples. Merneptah achieved a great victory in the summer of that year, and the inscription is mainly about this. The final lines deal with an apparently separate campaign in the East, where it seems that some of the Canaanite cities had revolted. Traditionally the Egyptians had concerned themselves only with cities, so the problem presented by Israel must have been something new – possibly attacks on Egypt's vassals in Canaan. Merneptah and Ramesses III fought off their enemies, but it was the beginning of the end of Egypt's control over Canaan – the last evidence of an Egyptian presence in the area is the name of [[Ramesses VI]] (1141–33) inscribed on a statue base from [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]].{{sfn|Drews|1995|pp=18–20}}

[[File:THnnww.gif|right|thumb|200px|[[Libya]]ns (Tjeḥenu) are described by determinatives: foreign person + people + [[hill-country (hieroglyph)|foreign country]] (=state/country of Libyan people)]]
The bulk of the inscription deals with Merneptah's victory over the Libyans, but the last 3 of the 28 lines shift to Canaan:{{sfn|Sparks|1998|pp= 96–97}}
{{Quote | &lt;poem&gt;The princes are prostrate, saying, "Peace!"
Not one is raising his head among the Nine Bows.
Now that Tehenu (Libya) has come to ruin,
:Hatti is pacified;
::The Canaan has been plundered into every sort of woe:
:::[[Ashkelon]] has been overcome;
:::[[Gezer]] has been captured;
:::[[Yenoam|Yano'am]] is made non-existent.
Israel is laid waste and his seed is not;
Hurru is become a widow because of Egypt.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The "nine bows" is a term the Egyptians used to refer to their enemies; the actual enemies varied according to time and circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ancient-egypt.co.uk/fitzwilliam/index_2.htm | title = FitzWilliam Museum | publisher = Ancient Egypt | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hatti and Ḫurru are Syro-Palestine, Canaan and Israel are smaller units, and Ashkelon, Gezer and Yanoam are cities within the region; according to the stele, all these entities fell under the rule of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egyptian empire at that time]].{{sfn|Smith|2002|p= 26}}

== Line 27 ==
==="Israel"===
Petrie called upon Wilhelm Spiegelberg, a German philologist in his archaeological team, to translate the inscription.  Spiegelberg was puzzled by one symbol towards the end, that of a people or tribe whom Merneptah (also written Merenptah) had victoriously smitten—''I.si.ri.ar?'' Petrie quickly suggested that it read "''Israel!''" Spiegelberg agreed that this translation must be correct.{{sfn|Drower|1985|p=221}} "Won't the reverends be pleased?" remarked Petrie. At dinner that evening, Petrie who realized the importance of the find said: "This stele will be better known in the world than anything else I have found." The news of its discovery made headlines when it reached the English papers.{{sfn|Drower|1985|p= 221}}

===Determinative===
While Ashkelon, Gezer and Yanoam are given the determinative for a city – a [[throw stick (hieroglyph)|throw stick]] plus [[hill-country (hieroglyph)|three mountains]] – the hieroglyphs that refer to Israel instead employ the [[Throw stick (hieroglyph)|throw stick]] (the determinative for "foreign") plus a sitting man and woman (the determinative for "people") over three vertical lines (a plural marker): &lt;hiero&gt;T14&lt;/hiero&gt; &lt;hiero&gt;A1*B1:Z2s&lt;/hiero&gt;

The [[Egyptian hieroglyphs#Determinatives|determinatives]] "people" has been the subject of significant scholarly discussion. As early as 1955, [[John A. Wilson (Egyptologist)|John A. Wilson]] wrote of the idea that this determinative means the "'ysrỉꜣr" were a people that: "The argument is good, but not conclusive, because of the notorious carelessness of Late- Egyptian scribes and several blunders of writing in this stela".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament|ANET]], 378 n. 18&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment was subsequently built upon by other scholars.&lt;ref name="BarKahn2011"&gt;{{cite book|chapter= The Battle Of Kadesh: Identifying New Kingdom Polities, Places, And Peoples In Canaan And Syria|author=Michael G. Hasel|editor1=S. Bar|editor2=D. Kahn|editor3=J.J. Shirley|title=Egypt, Canaan and Israel: History, Imperialism, Ideology and Literature: Proceedings of a Conference at the University of Haifa, 3-7 May 2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UC3KdEzloiYC&amp;pg=PA67|date=9 June 2011|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-19493-2|pages=67|doi=10.1163/ej.9789004194939.i-370.27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Oxford History of the biblical World'', this "foreign people" "sign is typically used by the Egyptians to signify [[nomads|nomadic]] groups or peoples, without a fixed city-state home, thus implying a seminomadic or rural status for 'Israel' at that time."{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p= 97}}{{efn|Whether the Egyptian scribes used these determinatives consistently in general and in the Merneptah Stele in particular, is in itself a matter of some debate.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=26}}}} The phrase "wasted, bare of seed" is formulaic, and often used of defeated nations – it implies that the grain-store of the nation in question has been destroyed, which would result in a famine the following year, incapacitating them as a military threat to Egypt.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p= 97}}
[[File:Israel segment.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A portion of line 27, translated as "Israel [foreign people]"]]

According to James Hoffmeier, "no Egyptologists would ever read the signs of a foreign ethnic entity as indicating a foreign land, but a people group.'&lt;ref&gt;J.K. Hoffmeier, ‘The Egyptian Origins of Israel: Recent Developments in Historiography," in Thomas E. Levy, Thomas Schneider, William H.C. Propp  (eds.)  [https://books.google.com/books?id=xpe1BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA202 ''Israel's Exodus in Transdisciplinary Perspective: Text, Archaeology, Culture, and Geoscience,''] Springer, 2015 pp.196-208 p.202.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this apparent Israelite statelessness, the other Canaanite groups fought by Egypt: Ashkelon, Gezer, and Yano'am, are described in the stele as nascent states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/archeology-hebrew-bible.html Archeology of the Hebrew Bible]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative translations===

While alternatives to the reading "Israel" have been put forward since the stele's discovery – the two primary candidates being "Jezreel",{{sfn|Eissfeldt|1965|p=14|ps=: "Unfortunately, even the supposed earliest mention of the name Israel in the triumphal hymn of Merenptah composed about 1230 b.c. does not provide any unambiguous answer to this question, for this name may also be explained as Jezreel."}}{{sfn|Margalith|1990|p=225}}{{sfn| Strahan|1896|p=624}} a [[Jezreel (city)|city]] and [[Jezreel Valley|valley]] in northern Canaan, and a continuation of the description of Libya referring to "wearers of the sidelock"{{efn|Nibbi suggests that the first character in "I.si.ri.ar" was misread - rather than [[List of hieroglyphs/G|G1]], Nibbi suggests [[List of hieroglyphs/G|G4]], and that such an amendment would allow the characters to be translated as "wearers of the sidelock", which refers to Libyans in other sources such as the [[Book of Gates]]. Nibbi supports this by noting that the male figure has an apparent outgrowth of hair on the side of his head.{{sfn|Nibbi|1989|p=101}}}} – most scholars accept that Merneptah refers to "Israel".{{efn|Hassel (2008): "The view that the term ysry·r/l is a possible territory within Canaan but not associated with biblical Israel was proposed by Othniel Margalith (1990). His conclusions are based on the suggestion by G. R. Driver (1948: 135) that the Egyptian letter 's' in the word could also represent the Hebrew [[zayin]]. Accordingly, the name ysry·r/l could be translated as Iezreel "which might be an inexperienced way of rendering Yezreel, the valley to the north of the country" (Margalith 1990: 229). As others have pointed out elsewhere, Margalith’s attempts to identify the entity ysry·r/l with Israel or Jezreel through Ugaritic vocalizations and a Sumerian title of a king are not convincing for an Egyptian inscription with a clear context for this entity in Canaan (Hasel 1994: 46; 1998a: 196–97; compare Kitchen 1966a: 91)."'' and ''"The suggestion of equating the ysry·r/l of the stela with Jezreel has now been taken up anew by I. Hjelm and Thomas L. Thompson (2002: 14) without any reference to earlier discussions. The identification is rife with difficulties. First, the Egyptian signs for "bolt" (Gardiner 1957: 507, O34) and "folded cloth" (Gardiner 1957: 507, S29) in Old Egyptian represented the sound s. In the New Kingdom, Hebrew zayin is rendered q or t in Egyptian and not s (Kitchen 1966a: 91, 1966b 59; Helck 1971: 18, 554, 589). Second, ysry·r/l does not include the Egyptian equivalent of ayin needed for the reading yzrªl. Third, the reading “Jezreel” must assume that the determinative for people used with ysry·r/ l was a scribal error, because it does not fit the designation of a geographical location. The orthographic and philological reasons mitigate the reading of ysry·r/ l as Jezreel (see also Kitchen 2004)."{{sfn|Hasel|2008|p=47-60}}}}

===Interpretation===
It is not clear, however, just who this Israel was or where they were located.&lt;ref&gt;Dermot Anthony Nestor,[https://books.google.com/books?id=arOoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191 ''Cognitive Perspectives on Israelite Identity,''] Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2010 p.191:'while the Merneptah stele may indeed prove beyond doubt that shortly before 1200 B.C.E. Egyptian intelligence either encountered or was informed of an inimical "Israel" residing in the highlands of Palestine, and that it was considered significant enough to warrant inclusion in the only known campaign of Merneptah in this region, any attempt by biblical scholars to translate this practical category into the substantialist idiom of an internally homogeneous, externally bounded group which serves to demarcate the evolution of that singular, regulative and constituting cultural tradition identified textually and archaeologically as "Israel" simply cannot be sustained.'&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Davies (2008): "Assuming we have Merneptah's dates correctly as 1213-1203, and that the reading "Israel" is correct, the reference places an Israel in Palestine in the thirteenth century. The word read (probably correctly) as "Israel" also has a sign indicating a people and not a place. That makes the alternative reading "Jezreel" less likely — though Hebrew "s" and "z" could both be represented by the same Egyptian letter; also, since "Jezreel" is partly made up of the word for "seed", the inscription could be a pun by a Semitic speaking scribe. It might also be considered that Merneptah would find it easier to fight in the plain of Jezreel than in the highlands."{{sfn|Davies|2008|p=90-91}}}} The reference to Israel in the stele has spawned two major schools of thought. The traditional schools of thought identify the 'Israel' in the stele with the Biblical Israel. However, the inquiries of the miminalist school of thought which doubts the biblical narrative's antiquity have impacted on the interpretation of the stele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenton L. Sparks|title=Ethnicity and Identity in Ancient Israel: Prolegomena to the Study of Ethnic Sentiments and Their Expression in the Hebrew Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KztVonFGqcsC&amp;pg=PA95|year=1998|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-1-57506-033-0|pages=95–}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the "who", if those depicted on the battle reliefs of [[Karnak]] are the Israelites, then Merneptah's Israelites are therefore Canaanites, because they are depicted in Canaanite costume; if, on the other hand, the Karnak reliefs do not show Merneptah's campaigns, then the stele's Israelites may be "[[Shasu]]", a term used by the Egyptians to refer to nomads and marauders.{{sfn|Whitelam|1997|p=26, fn. 16}}

Similarly, if Merneptah's claim to have destroyed Israel's "seed" means that he destroyed its grain supply, then Israel can be taken to be a settled, crop-growing people; if, however, it means he killed Israel's progeny, then Israel can be taken to be pastoralists, i.e., Shasu.{{sfn|Killebrew|2005|p=154}} The normative Egyptian use of "wasted, bare of seed" was as a repeated, formulaic phrase to declare victory over a defeated nation or people group whom the Egyptian army conquered and had literally destroyed their grain supply in the specific geographic region that they inhabited.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=97}} Michael G. Hasel, arguing that ''prt'' on the stele meant grain, suggested that "Israel functioned as an agriculturally based or sedentary socioethnic entity in the late 13th century BCE"&lt;ref name="autogenerated54"&gt;{{Citation |first = Michael G.|last = Hasel|title = Israel in the Merneptah Stela|journal = BASOR|volume = 296|year = 1994|pages = 54, 56|number = 12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and this in some degree of contrast to nomadic "Shasu" pastoralists in the region. Others disagree that ''prt'' meant grain, and [[Edward Lipinski (orientalist)|Edward Lipinski]] wrote that "the "classical" opposition of nomadic shepherds and settled farmers does not seem to suit the area concerned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Lipinski|first = Edward | title = On the Skirts of Canaan in the Iron Age: Historical and Topographical Researches|year= 2006 | publisher = Peeters| isbn = 978-90-429-1798-9 |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasel also says that this does not suggest that the Israelites were an urban people at this time, nor does it provide information about the actual social structure of the people group identified as Israel.&lt;ref name="autogenerated54" /&gt; Biblical scholar [[Thomas L. Thompson]] writes that "this name in the Merneptah inscription of the late thirteenth-century might conceivably understand it as the name of a region, in polarity with the clearly geographical name: ''Canaan''." Also, "The group "Israel" ... are rather a very specific group among the population of Palestine which bears a name that occurs here for the first time that at a much later stage in Palestine's history bears a substantially different signification." For, "References to the Merneptah stele are not really helpful. This text renders for us only the earliest known usage of the name 'Israel.'" So, "to begin the origins of biblical Israel with Merneptah ... on the grounds that we have extra-biblical rather than biblical attestation is willful. These texts are, ''mirabile dictu'', even less relevant than the biblical traditions."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XqoMRPJca-wC&amp;pg=PA404 Early History of the Israelite People], Thomas L. Thompson, pp. 139, 311 and 404. Quote: "With the "Israel" stele we have only a name in an historical context in which the shifting signification and dislocation of regional and gentilic toponymy over centuries is a commonplace"&lt;/ref&gt;

As for its location, most scholars believe that Merneptah's Israel must have been in the hill country of central Canaan, but some think it was across the Jordan, others that it was a coalition of Canaanite settlements in the lowlands of the Jezreel valley (the potential Israelites on the walls of Karnak are driving chariots, a weapon of the lowlands rather than the highlands), and others that the inscription gives very little useful information at all.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=115–16}}

==Karnak reliefs==
The stele was found in Merenptah's funerary chapel in Thebes, the ancient Egyptian capital on the west bank of the Nile.  On the opposite bank is the Temple of Karnak, where the fragmentary copy was found. In the 1970s Frank Yurco announced that some reliefs at Karnak which had been thought to depict events in the reign of Ramesses II, Merenptah's father, in fact belonged to Merenptah. The four reliefs show the capture of three cities, one of them labelled as Ashkelon; Yurco suggested that the other two were Gezer and Yanoam. The fourth shows a battle in open hilly country against an enemy shown as Canaanite. Yurco suggested that this scene was to be equated with the Israel of the stele. While the idea that Merneptah's Israelites are to be seen on the walls of the temple has had an influence on many theories regarding the significance of the inscription, not all Egyptologists accept Yurco's ascription of the reliefs to Merneptah.{{sfn|Killebrew|2005|p= 155}}

'''Mexican Renaissance''' refers to the [[Mexican muralism]] movement between 1920 and 1950.&lt;ref name="Lopez2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beller2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Provost Beller|title=The Aftermath of the Mexican Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JLAgj6eZY4oC&amp;pg=PT107|date=1 September 2008|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-0-8225-7600-6|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was first used in ''Idols behind Altars'' by [[Anita Brenner]], with [[Jean Charlot]].&lt;ref name="Lopez2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rick A.

{{Quotation|There are some simplifications which have become history, and one of them is the tie, which in itself is quite true, between the Mexican Renaissance, so called, and the [[Mexican Revolution]].

The '''Portsmouth and District Magic Circle (PDMC)''' is a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]]s' society based in [[Portsmouth]] in the English county of [[Hampshire]]. It is one of the largest magic societies in the UK with nearly 100 members.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Mischa (11 January 2012 ). [http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/lifestyle/now-that-s-magic-1-3405614 "Now that's magic!"], ''Portsmouth News''&lt;/ref&gt;

The society was founded in 1938 at a meeting in the Talbot Hotel in Portsmouth. Amongst its founding members were the close-up magician [[Lewis Ganson]] and the master illusionist [[Will Ayling]], author of ''The Art of Illusion'' and ''Oriental Conjuring and Magic''.&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, John (27 February 1993).

Da Capo Press. {{ISBN|078671770X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society organizes an annual event called "Jumbo Day" in which magicians from around the UK gather to trade and sell magic equipment and paraphernalia and attend workshops and demonstrations. The event closes with a gala magic show in the evening. According to the PDMC, "Jumbo Day" is southern England's "largest annual one-day magic event."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portsmouthmagic.co.uk PDMC official website]&lt;/ref&gt; Members also raise money for the [[Anthony Nolan Trust]] with "Magic Trek", a sponsored walk from the headquarters of the PDMC in Portsmouth to the headquarters of [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]] in London, stopping off at various magic societies along the route. The first "Magic Trek" took place in 2009 led by PDMC member Sean Lobban dressed in a giant bunny costume accompanied by an [[escapologist]], a [[juggler]], a magician, and several other entertainers.&lt;ref&gt;''Portsmouth News'' (3 March 2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17370">{{Culture of Qatar}}
The modern '''[[Qatar]]i art''' movement emerged in the mid-20th century, as a result of the new-found wealth acquired from oil exports and subsequent modernization of Qatari society. Because of [[Islam]]'s non-inclusive stance of [[Aniconism in Islam|depictions of sentient beings]] in visual arts, paintings historically played an insignificant role in the country's culture.&lt;ref name="abusaud140"&gt;A. Abu Saud (1984), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Other visual art forms such as calligraphy, architecture and textiles were more highly regarded in the [[Bedouin]] tradition.&lt;ref name="abusaud140"/&gt;

==Development of modern art==
[[File:MuseumOfIslamicArtEntrance.jpg|thumb|[[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha|Museum of Islamic Art]], inaugurated in 2008]]
The art scene in Qatar witnessed substantial development in the mid- and late 1950s. Initially, arts were overseen by the Ministry of Education, with [[art exhibition]]s being hosted in its facilities.&lt;ref name="abusaud142"/&gt; In 1972, the government started providing increased funding to aid the development of arts within the country. The father of modern artists in Qatar is Jassim Zaini (1943–2012), whose work explored diversity in techniques and documented the changing society from traditional local life to a global style. The Qatari Fine Arts Society was established in 1980 with the objective of promoting the works of Qatari artists.&lt;ref name="abusaud142"/&gt; In 1998, the National Council for Culture, Arts and Heritage was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qatarconsulatela.org/about-qatar/culture-arts/|title=Culture &amp; Arts|publisher=Consulate General of the State of Qatar|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Qatar Museums]] was established in the early 2000s to build and connect all museums and collections in Qatar. Two major museums  lead the institution: the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha|Museum of Islamic Art]] opened in 2008, and the [[Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art]], opened in Education City by [[Qatar Foundation]] in 2010.

==Prehistoric art==
[[File:Jebel_Jassassiyeh_rock_carvings.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Rock carvings in [[Jebel Jassassiyeh]] depicting a boat]]
Ancient [[petroglyph|rock carvings]] have been discovered in eight separate locations in Qatar: [[Jebel Jassassiyeh]], Jabel Fuwayrit, [[Freiha]], [[Al Ghariyah]], Al Jumail, [[Simaisma]], [[Al Wakrah]] and Al Kassar. Most of these sites were discovered by Danish archaeological teams in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="nayeem7"&gt;Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; The carvings are classified in a number of categories, including human and animal representation, boat representation, [[Cup and ring mark|cup-marks]], large cavities, geometric designs, tribal marks, and hand- and footprints.&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of rock carvings were discovered in Jebel Jassassiyeh, in northeast Qatar, in 1961. Variations in motifs and technique indicate that the carvings were made through various historical periods.&lt;ref name="nayeem8"&gt;Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Cup-marks are the most common forms of art among the nearly 900 carvings. Other carvings include ships, animals, foot-prints and tribal marks (known as ''wasum'').&lt;ref name="nayeem7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bibby|first=Geoffrey|title=Arabian Gulf archaeology|journal=Kuml|year=1965|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different animals are depicted, such as ostriches, turtles and fish. A large number of the carvings illustrate boats, and this is the only site in Qatar where boat depictions have been recorded. The boats are of different sizes and types, and some contain [[oar]]s while others do not.&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geometrical designs were recorded at Freiha in four places. They measure 11 to 15&amp;nbsp;cm in width and 11 to 12&amp;nbsp;cm in height. Danish archaeologist [[Peter Glob]] believed that they were carved by an ancient fertility cult.&lt;ref name="256nayeem"&gt;Abdul Nayeem (1998), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glob|first=Peter|title=Prehistoric discoveries in Qatar|journal=Kuml|year=1957|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was disputed by Muhammad Abdul Nayeem, who believes that they are simply abstract symbols or tribal marks.&lt;ref name="256nayeem"/&gt;

==Textiles==

===Weaving and dyeing===
[[File:Fabric displays in Souq Waqif.jpg|thumb|Satin fabrics on display in [[Souq Waqif]]]]
[[Weaving]] and [[dyeing]] played a substantial role in [[Bedouin]] culture. The process of spinning sheep's and camel's wool to produce cloth was laborious. The wool was first disentangled and tied to a bobbin, which would serve as a core and keep the fibers rigid. This was followed by spinning the wool by hand on a spindle known as a ''noul''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Abu Saud (1984), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; They were then placed on a vertical [[loom]] constructed from wood whereupon women would use a stick to beat the [[weft]] into place.&lt;ref name="abusaud136"&gt;A. Abu Saud (1984), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting cloths were used in rugs, carpets and tents. Tents were usually made up of naturally colored cloth, whereas rugs and carpets used dyed cloth, mainly red and yellow.&lt;ref name="abusaud136"/&gt; The dyes were made from desert herbs, with simple geometrical designs being employed. The art lost popularity in the 19th century as dyes and cloth were increasingly imported from other regions in Asia.&lt;ref name="abusaud136"/&gt;

===Embroidery===
[[File:Embroidered dresses in Souq Waqif.jpg|thumb|left|Embroidered dresses on display in Souq Waqif]]
A simple form of embroidery practiced by Qatari women was known as ''[[Kurar (embroidery)|kurar]]''. It involved four women, each carrying four threads, who braided the threads on articles of clothing, mainly ''[[thawb]]s'' or ''[[abaya]]s''. The braids, varying in color, were sewn vertically. It was similar to heavy [[chain stitch]] embroidery.&lt;ref name="abusaud136"/&gt; Gold threads, known as ''[[zari]]'', were commonly used. They were usually imported from [[India]].&lt;ref name="abusaud137"&gt;A. Abu Saud (1984), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of embroidery involved the designing of caps called ''[[Taqiyah (cap)|gohfiahs]]''. They were made from cotton and were pierced with thorns from palm-trees to allow the women to sew between the holes. This form of embroidery declined in popularity after the country began importing the caps.&lt;ref name="abusaud137"/&gt;

''Khiyat al madrasa'', translated as 'school embroidery', involved the stitching of furnishings by [[satin stitch]]ing. Prior to the stitching process, a shape was drawn onto the fabric by a skilled artist. The most common designs were birds and flowers.&lt;ref name="abusaud140"/&gt;

==Architecture==
{{See also|Category:Forts in Qatar}}
[[File:Ath Thaqab Fort.jpg|thumb|[[Ath Thaqab]] Fort]]
The numerous forts found throughout the Qatari peninsula are a testament to the country's ancient construction methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qm.org.qa/en/project/forts-qatar|title=Forts in Qatar|publisher=Qatar Museums|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most forts were constructed using mainly [[limestone]], with other constituents such as mud and clay brick also being used. A type of mixture consisting of mud and clay brick known locally as ''lubnah'' was sometimes used in the construction of forts, such as in [[Ar Rakiyat Fort]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Syriac Writers of Qatar in the Seventh Century'' (2014), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture in Doha===
Most traditional houses in the capital [[Doha]] were tightly packed and arranged around a central courtyard. A number of rooms were situated in the courtyard, most often including a ''[[majilis]]'', bathroom and store room. The houses were made from limestone quarried from local sources. Walls surrounding the compounds were made up of compressed mud, gravel and small stones. As they were heavily susceptible to natural erosion, they were protected by [[gypsum]] [[plaster]]. Mangrove poles wrapped in jute rope provided structural support for the windows and doors.&lt;ref name="originsofdoha"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://originsofdoha.wordpress.com/2015/02/15/traditional-domestic-architecture-of-qatar/|title=Traditional domestic architecture of Qatar|publisher=Origins of Doha|date=15 February 2015|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Traditional Qatari houses in Al Wakrah.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional Qatari houses in [[Al Wakrah]] Heritage Village]]
Roofs were typically flat and were supported by mangrove poles. The poles were covered with a layer of split bamboo and a palm mat locally called ''manghrour''. The mangrove poles often extended past the exterior walls for decorative purposes. Doors were made of metal or wood. Colored glass employing geometrical designs was sometimes used in windows.&lt;ref name="originsofdoha"/&gt;

Several methods were used in traditional architecture to alleviate the harsh climate of the country. Windows were seldom used in order to reduce heat conduction.&lt;ref name="originsofdoha"/&gt; The ''badgheer'' construction method allowed air to be channeled into houses for ventilation purposes. This was accomplished by several methods, including horizontal air gaps in rooms and parapets, and vertical openings in wind towers called ''hawaya'' which drew air into the courtyards. Wind towers, however, were not as common in Doha as they were in other parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catnaps.org/islamic/gulfarch4.html|title=Gulf architecture|publisher=catnaps.org|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Qatar gained independence, many of the districts of old Doha, including [[Al Najada]], Al Asmakh and [[Al Hitmi|Old Al Hitmi]], faced gradual decline, and as a result much of their historical architecture has been demolished.&lt;ref name="bouassa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7412457/Al_Asmakh_historic_district_in_Doha_Qatar_from_an_urban_slum_to_living_heritage_PLEASE_SCROLL_DOWN_FOR_ARTICLE_Al_Asmakh_historic_district_in_Doha_Qatar_from_an_urban_slum_to_living_heritage|title=Al Asmakh historic district in Doha, Qatar: from an urban slum to living heritage|website=academia.edu|author=Djamel Bouassa|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of schemes have been taken to preserve the city's cultural and architectural heritage, such as the [[Qatar Museums Authority]]'s 'Al Turath al Hai' ('living heritage') initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marhaba.qa/the-winners-of-the-old-doha-prize-competition-announced/|title=The Winners of the Old Doha Prize Competition Announced|publisher=Marhaba|date=26 November 2013|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, paintings were not common in Qatari society. Instead, other art forms such as calligraphy and architecture were preferred.&lt;ref name="abusaud140"/&gt; After the oil boom in the mid-20th century, paintings gained popularity. Common themes during this period were related to Islamic and Arabic heritage.&lt;ref&gt;A. Abu Saud (1984), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art exhibition]]s were held under the auspices of the Ministry of Education until 1972.&lt;ref name="abusaud142"&gt;A. Abu Saud (1984), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Education integrated art education into the school system and allocated facilities for art workshops.&lt;ref name="jasra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aljasra.org/archive/cms/?p=324|title=رحلة الفن التشكيلي بدولة قطر أ.د. ليلي حسن علام|publisher=Aljasra Culture Magazine|date=16 June 2010|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an initiative to develop the local artist base, the ministry began offering scholarships to study art abroad. [[Jassim Zaini]] became the first Qatari art student to study abroad on a scholarship in 1962 after he enrolled in the [[University of Baghdad]]. Several more artists were sent abroad on art scholarships during the 1960s and 1970s, including [[Wafika Sultan Al-Essa|Wafika Sultan]], [[Hassan Al Mulla]] and [[Yousef Ahmad]]. The latter became the first artist to receive an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1981. Yousef Ahmad was the first artist to hold a [[solo exhibition]] in 1977. Under its director [[Nasser Al-Othman]], the Culture and Arts Department inaugurated the country's first art gallery in 1977–78.&lt;ref name="jasra"/&gt;

Yousef Ahmad, Hassan Al Mulla and Muhammad Ali established the country's first art group in 1977, "The Three Friends Group".&lt;ref name="jasra"/&gt; In 1980, the Qatari Fine Arts Society was established with the objective of promoting the works of Qatari artists.&lt;ref name="abusaud142"/&gt; That year, an art workshop was opened for women with the aim of providing them with an opportunity to hone their artistic skills.&lt;ref&gt;A. Abu Saud (1984), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; The Qatari Fine Arts Society held their first exhibition in 1981.&lt;ref name="abusaud142"/&gt; In December 1982, the country's first art exhibition for females was held.&lt;ref name="jasra"/&gt;

[[File:Sheikh Hassan.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Hassan bin Mohamed bin Ali Al Thani|Hassan bin Mohammed Al Thani]] has featured prominently in Qatar's art scene since 1986]]
Five main art movements emerged in the country by the late 20th century: [[surrealism]], [[Realism (arts)|realism]], [[expressionism]], [[abstract art]], and [[calligraphy]].&lt;ref name="jasra"/&gt;

A member of the ruling family, [[Hassan bin Mohamed bin Ali Al Thani]], has been an instrumental figure in developing Qatar's modern art industry since the 1980s. Among his art-related activities was establishing his own museum which doubled as a residency space for Doha-based artists in 1994, and establishing the [[Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art]] in 2010 to which he donated his entire art collection, which he had begun assembling in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6swDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165|title=Art and the Global Economy|publisher=University of California Press|author=John Zarobell|page=165|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a quartet comprising Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt [[2017–18 Qatar diplomatic crisis|severed all ties]] with and imposed a blockade of Qatar on 5 June 2017, Qatari artist Ahmed Al-Maadheed created an illustration known as "Tamim Almajd", which translates to "Tamim the Glorious". A simple black and white sketch of Emir [[Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani]], beneath of which is the text "Tamim Almajd" in the style of [[Arabic calligraphy]], the illustration has become symbolic of Qatari nationalism. The image is now displayed prominently on buildings, in media and in art in Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tamim-the-glorious-enthrals-qatar/article19421398.ece|title=‘Tamim the Glorious’ enthrals Qatar|publisher=The Hindu|agency=AFP|date=3 August 2017|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than speaking only in spoonerisms, Runny is a normal child. He has many friends, and two loving parents, his "Dummy and mad," who often remind him to "Shake a tower," "Dash the wishes," "Tush your breeth," "Rean your cloom," and other chores.

'''Sarah Anne Drake''' (1803–1857) was an English [[botanical illustrator]] who worked for [[John Lindley]] and collaborated with [[Augusta Innes Withers]], [[Nathaniel Wallich]] and others.

==Biography==
Sarah Drake was born in [[Skeyton]] on July 24, 1803, the same area of [[Norfolk]] as the London University botanist John Lindley and went to school with Lindley's sister Anne. As a young woman, she went to [[Paris]], where she probably studied painting as was expected of young women of the day. In 1830 "Ducky" (as she became known) moved into the Lindley home at [[Acton Green, London|Acton Green]] in London. She appears to have had a number of roles in the Lindley home, including that of [[governess]], but eventually took up botanical art, gradually taking over from Lindley the illustration of his botanical publications. She  created illustrations for his ''Sertum Orchidaceae'', for example, as well as over 1000 illustrations for the horticultural magazine ''[[The Botanical Register|Edwards's Botanical Register]]'', which Lindley edited from 1829 to 1847. More than 300 of these drawings were of [[orchids]] and Lindley named the [[Western Australian]] [[orchid]] genus ''[[Drakaea]]'' in her honour.&lt;ref name=hh&gt;{{cite book | first = Helen | last = Hewson | year = 1999 | title = Australia: 300 years of botanical illustration | publisher = CSIRO Publishing | location = Collingwood, Victoria | isbn = 0-643-06366-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jk&gt;Kramer, Jack. ''Women of Flowers: A Tribute to Victorian Women Illustrators''. Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's work - Sarah Drake 1803-1857|url=http://womenswork.lindahall.org/drake1.shtml|publisher=Linda Hall Library of Science, Engineering and Technology|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hopper&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopper|first1=Stephen D.|last2=Brown|first2=Andrew P.|title=A revision of Australia' s hammer orchids (Drakaea: Orchidaceae), with some field data on species-specific sexually deceived wasp pollinators|journal=Australian Systematic Botany|date=2007|volume=20|issue=3|pages=262–264|doi=10.1071/SB06033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drake is perhaps best known for her collaboration with Augusta Withers on the drawings for the monumental ''Orchidaceae of Mexico and Guatemala'' by [[James Bateman]], but she also contributed to Lindley's book, ''Ladies Botany'' (1834–1837), Nathaniel Wallich's ''[[Plantae Asiaticae Rariores]]'', [[John Forbes Royle]]'s ''Illustrations of the botany and other branches of the natural history of the Himalayan Mountains'' and to ''[[HMS Sulphur (1826)|The Botany of HMS Sulphur]]'' (1836–1842). She did not travel abroad and probably went no further than [[Kew Gardens]], the Lindley home or to [[Loddiges]] nursery, which put on a display of orchids especially for her.&lt;ref name=jk/&gt;&lt;ref name=ams&gt;Schmidt, Alesandra M., and Trudy B. Jacoby. [http://digitalrepository.trincoll.edu/exhibitions/3 "Herbs to Orchids: Botanical Illustration in the Nineteenth Century"].

Drake's career ended when the ''Botanical Register'' went out of business in 1847. She returned to Norfolk to care for elderly relatives and moved in with her uncle, Daniel Drake. In 1852 she married John Sutton Hastings, a wealthy farmer. She died on July 9, 1857, [[wikt:putatively|putatively]] from [[diabetes]], but it has been speculated that she may have suffered from [[cumulative poison]]ing from her painting materials. In 2000 a memorial plaque commemorating her work was unveiled at the parish church where she is buried.&lt;ref name=hh/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kew" /&gt;

'''Shakiragha mausoleum''' ({{lang-az|'''Şakirağa türbəsi'''}}) is a historical monument of the XV century. It is located in [[Balaxanı|Balakhany]] village in the city of [[Baku]] in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name="sabunchu"/&gt;

==History==
Shakiraga mausoleum is located in Balakhani Cemetery and was built in 1427–1428.&lt;ref name="sabunchu"&gt;{{cite web|title= Ölkə və yerli əhəmiyyətli Memarlıq və Arxeoloji abidələr|url= http://sabunchu-ih.gov.az/page/120.html|publisher= sabunchu-ih.gov.az|language= az|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also It is six meters from the Haji Shahla mosque which was built in 1385–1386. The information about the monument is limited. The monument was once destroyed by the Soviet as a religious monument.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;

During an excavation in 1976, gold was found at its foundation. At that time, big earthenware pots full of gold were buried in basis of the monuments for their future restoration. The mausoleum was repaired with few percent of the found gold.&lt;ref name="gomap"&gt;{{cite web|title= Hacı Şakir türbəsi|url= https://kataloq.gomap.az/az/all-poi/culture/cemetery/8ea7ee12d56611e0ad4900226424597d|publisher= kataloq.gomap.az|language= az|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two-lined inscription in [[Arabic]] on the [[arch]]-shaped entrance door. Is written in the text:

{{cquote|''"Mirirakhur Shakir Agha ibn-marhum Murtaza, one of the elders of the nation and religion, ordered the construction of this monument. Year 831 (1427–28)"''}}
According to another source, Shakiragha mausoleum was erected by [[Ibrahim I of Shirvan|Shirvan Ibrahim]]’s vizier in honor of his son in 1427, and is called a mansion.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;

==Architectural features== 
The mausoleum consists of hall with a dome and a main arch of the facade with ledge. It is built of white stone, which is characteristic for Absheron architecture.&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;

The mausoleum is cross-shaped in the plan. There are several cross-shaped monuments (Khan's Garden pavilion in [[Nardaran]], mausoleum in [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs]] complex and others) by its interior structure in [[Absheron Peninsula|Absheron]]. However, there is no second monument in the shape of cross by its both internal and external structure as Shakiragha mausoleum in Azerbaijan.

The entrance to the mausoleum is the [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] on the north. At internal area of the portal, octagonal prism-shaped niches, which are completed with arrow-shaped arch at both sides, are placed. There are also 8 niches of different sized rectangles inside the mausoleum.

The entrance is from the door, which is finished with a low arrow-shaped arch. The arch on the door is hewed from a whole stone. The surface of the stone is decorated with a plant ornament. There is also another stone placed on arch stone of the entrance, on which two lines of an epic writing is carved. The entrance and the stone with writing are framed with profiled large stone blocks.

'''Tapas''', formerly known as '''Tapastic''', is a [[webtoon]] syndicate set up by [[South Korea]]n entrepreneur Chang Kim in October 2012. Operated from both [[Seoul]] and [[San Francisco]] by '''Tapas Media''', Tapastic features a large collection of short-form, English-language webcomics and [[webtoons]] from over 5,000 artists.&lt;ref name=Startup&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2015/04/03/startup-battles-naver-in-english-webtoons/|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|title=Startup Battles Naver in English Webtoons|last=Lee|first=Jun-Youb|date=2015-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website aims to create a platform where comic creators can publish their works without cost, describing itself as the "[[YouTube]] of Comics." Since 2016, the Tapas Media's [[mobile app]] also publishes books through a [[freemium]] business model.

==History==
{{quotebox|"We discovered a lot of people still use print publishing, and paid their own money to print comics ... Or people start their own website, in which case you have to build your audience, think about mobile, pay for hosting. It just doesn't really work out."|Chang Kim&lt;ref name=Youtube&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/54294/20150520/youtube-comics-tapastic-creating-new-publishing-opportunities-creators-fans.htm|publisher=''Tech Times''|title=The YouTube Of Comics: How Tapastic Offers New Publishing Opportunities For Creators And Fans|last=Serafino|first=Jason|date=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=30%}}

Chang Kim came up with the idea of starting an open-publishing platform after wondering if there was a singular online location to read all the webcomics he was a fan of. While YouTube users were making money through uploading independent video content, there existed no equivalent for comic creators. Kim also noted that this business model was already successful in South Korea.&lt;ref name=Youtube /&gt; With $3.4 million in backing from both American and Korean investors, including [[Daum Kakao]] and former [[Facebook]] Chief Technology Officer Adam D’Angelo, Kim started up Tapastic in 2012.&lt;ref name=Startup /&gt;

In 2014, Tapastic reached a partnership with [[Daum Communications]], which operates the largest webtoon portal in South Korea. Through this partnership, Tapastic hopes to bring over successful Korean titles to see if they can find success in the United States market. The partnership deal also resulted in $2 million USD of [[Series A round|Series A funding]] for Tapastic.&lt;ref name=Daum&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/28/tapastic-raises-2m-to-build-out-its-youtube-of-webcomics-and-visual-storytelling/|publisher=''[[Tech Crunch]]''|title=Tapastic Raises $2M To Build Out Its YouTube Of Webcomics And Visual Storytelling|last=Etherington|first=Darrell|date=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2014/01/tapastics-ceo-talks-new-partnership-launch-of-like-a-wolf/|publisher=''[[Comic Book Resources]]''|title=Tapastic’s CEO talks new partnership, launch of ‘Like a Wolf’|last=Alverson|first=Brigid|date=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Tapas Media released a new mobile app, simply titled "Tapas". Using a [[freemium]] business model by offering content to readers for free as an incentive to pay more, the app added [[books]] to its line-up of offered media. According to Tapas Media, around 10&amp;ndash;20% of the books are offered for free, creating a form of [[product sample|sample preview]]. Books are split up into "bite-sized micro chapters" in order to allow people to read portions within a few minutes. The model was inspired by [[free-to-play]] video games, such as ''[[Candy Crush]]''.&lt;ref name=PublishersWeekly&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/Apps/article/69909-e-book-app-applies-gaming-e-commerce-model-to-mobile-reading.html|publisher=''[[Publishers Weekly]]''|title=E-book App Applies Gaming E-Commerce Model To Mobile Reading|last=Gross|first=Anisse|date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 17, 2017, Tapastic announced that it had changed its name to Tapas, redesigning parts of their website in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@Tapas_App/hello-tapas-io-b41cb5f2d1e7|work=[[Medium.com]]|title=Hello, tapas.io|author=Tapas Media|date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tapas Media changed its [[terms of service]] the same day: the addition of a "Right of First Refusal" clause spurred controversy among the service' users. According to this clause, Tapas Media had the right to negotiate and refuse licensing deals for its users. Tapas Media reversed its decision on May 18, 2017 due to poor reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/05/18/webcomics-publisher-hiveworks-weighs-tapas-right-first-refusal-controversy/|work=[[Bleeding Cool]]|title=Webcomics Publisher Hiveworks Weighs In On Tapas "Right To First Refusal" Controversy|last=Terror|first=Jude|date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sync with their name change, they have also added several features such as friend codes, which benefits gives the code-owner and the invitee 200 coins, used for unlocking episodes and chapters.

==Content==
At its launch, Tapastic billed itself as the "YouTube of Comics".&lt;ref name=Youtube /&gt; By 2015, the website features a collection of webcomics from over 5,000 unique artists.&lt;ref name=Startup /&gt; Kim stated that [[slice-of-life]]-style webcomics are the most popular on the service, which is likely because of their "shareability" and because they can quickly be read. Kim also noted that webcomics featuring school life and work life are "deeply relatable" to Tapastic readers.&lt;ref name=Youtube /&gt;

The website has formed an interactive community, with fans discussing the comics and some creators asking for fan feedback.&lt;ref name=Youtube /&gt; According to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Tapastic had over a million active readers by April 2016, most of which are from North America and 90% of which are under the age of 34.&lt;ref name=PublishersWeekly /&gt; Tapastic allows its content creators to profit from their work by selling premium webcomic series and by receiving [[donations]] in turn of exclusive benefits. Some artists on Tapastic make over $800 USD per month on the service.&lt;ref name=Startup /&gt; Creators on Tapastic are also supported by shared [[online advertisement|ad revenue]].&lt;ref name=Daum /&gt;

Tapastic features a subscription feed similar to that of [[RSS]], which is optimized to be used on the company's mobile app. In contrast, Caitlin Rosberg of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' described using the Tapastic website as a "steep but fast [[learning curve]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/harley-quinn-25-features-breakthrough-dcs-hit-char-232166|publisher=''[[The A.V.

A '''text publication society''' is a [[learned society]] which publishes (either as its sole function, or as a principal function) scholarly editions of old works of historical or literary interest, or archival documents. In addition to full texts, a text publication society may publish translations, [[Calendar (archives)|calendar]]s and indexes.

Members of the society (private individuals or institutions) pay an annual [[Subscription business model|subscription]], in return for which they either automatically receive a copy of each volume as it is published, or (as in the case of, for example, the [[Royal Historical Society]]) are eligible to purchase volumes at favourable members' rates. Some societies attempt to keep to a regular cycle of publishing (generally one volume per year, as in the case of the [[London Record Society]] and the [[Canterbury and York Society]]: the [[Royal Historical Society]], exceptionally, aims for two volumes per year). Others, however, publish on an irregular and occasional basis, as the completion of editorial work allows. Volumes are usually also made available for sale to non-members, but the price is invariably higher than that paid (either as the retail price or through subscriptions) by members, thereby establishing an incentive for interested parties to join. The model originated and is most commonly found in the United Kingdom, but has also been adopted in other countries. 

In the 19th century, when many of the societies were founded, they were sometimes known as '''book clubs'''. They have also been termed '''printing clubs'''.&lt;ref&gt;Levine 1986, pp. 16, 40-45, 178-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Those that publish exclusively [[Archive|archival]] material are often known as '''record societies''' or '''records societies'''.

==Historical development==
The principle of [[Subscription business model|subscription]] publishing – that is, of funding the publication of a volume by securing multiple advance subscriptions from individuals interested in buying the final product – was first established in the 17th century, and routinely adopted during the 18th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=S.L.C. |last=Clapp |title=The Beginnings of subscription publication in the seventeenth century |journal=Modern Philology |volume=29 |year=1931 |pages=199–224 |doi=10.1086/387957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=F. B. |last=Williams |chapter=Scholarly publication in Shakespeare's day: a leading case |editor1-first=James G. |editor1-last=McManaway |editor2-first=Giles E. |editor2-last=Dawson |editor3-first=Edwin E. |editor3-last=Willoughby |title=Joseph Quincy Adams: memorial studies |place=Washington, DC |publisher=Folger Shakespeare Library |year=1948 |pages=755–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of extending the model to the membership of a society was initiated by the [[Roxburghe Club]], founded in 1812 as a convivial association of [[bibliophile]]s, but which rapidly introduced the principle that each member should sponsor the publication of an edition of a rare work of interest to members, and that other volumes would be published by the Club collectively. In both cases the volumes were intended for distribution to the entire membership. The Club's first publication, donated by Sir William Bolland and issued in 1814, was the [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey|Earl of Surrey]]'s translation of parts of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', originally printed in 1557.

One early Roxburghe Club member (from 1822) was [[Sir Walter Scott]], who was inspired by it to establish the [[Bannatyne Club]] to print works of interest for Scottish tradition, literature and history. Other special-interest societies followed. In contrast to the exclusive Roxburghe Club (which had an elite membership and issued its publications as luxurious limited editions), most had broad membership criteria, and had as their primary objective the dissemination of valuable historical texts as widely as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Levine 1986, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, their activities tended to appeal to the "monied and educated" classes: in 1838, 20% of the [[Camden Society]]'s members were clergymen, 9% held legal qualifications, and 36% were [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine 1986, pp. 43–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Success being dependent on fund-raising and the attraction of new members, the early societies often suffered from financial and organisational troubles. Controversy followed [[Frederick James Furnivall]], a prime mover in many of the early ventures. In the second half of the 19th century the government-sponsored [[Rolls Series]] took over some of the territory of the amateur societies, particularly in respect of the publication of [[chronicle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Levine 1986, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The productions of several of the early societies included literary texts, but by the end of the 19th century the majority of societies were tending to focus instead on the publication of [[Archive|archival]] records. This continued to be the pattern in the 20th century.

The Durham-based [[Surtees Society]], founded in 1834 and modelled in part on the Scottish Bannatyne and [[Maitland Club|Maitland]] Clubs,&lt;ref&gt;Levine 1986, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first English society to adopt a specifically ''regional'' remit, in its case the elucidation of the history of the area constituting the ancient [[kingdom of Northumbria]]. Its establishment was deeply rooted in local pride: in an early prospectus, [[James Raine]] (its principal founder and first secretary) drew attention to just a few unpublished manuscripts of Durham interest, "which, in these times, few individuals would incur the risk of printing at their own cost; but which nevertheless, afford even singly, how much more collectively, the most valuable materials to those who are anxious to study rightly the History of our forefathers under its different characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. Hamilton |last=Thompson |title=The Surtees Society, 1834–1934, including a catalogue of its publications with notes on their sources and contents, and a list of the members of the society from its beginning to the present day |series=Surtees Society |volume=150 |place=Durham |year=1939 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chetham Society]], founded in 1843, concerned itself in much the same way with the counties of [[Lancashire]] and [[Cheshire]]. From the 1880s onwards, many societies focused on a single county. A particularly energetic advocate was [[William Phillimore Watts Phillimore|W. P. W. Phillimore]], who was active in the foundation of the [[British Record Society]], [[Scottish Record Society]], [[Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire|Thoroton Society]], [[Canterbury and York Society]], and Irish Record Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |first=Kate |last=Tiller |title=Phillimore [formerly Stiff], William Phillimore Watts (1853–1913) |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |edition=online  |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/57556 }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several county [[archaeology|archaeological]] and historical societies undertook text publication as just one among a broader range of activities, and in certain cases – for example, the [[Yorkshire Archaeological and Historical Society]] and the [[Kent Archaeological Society]] – continue to do so. In other cases, a new society has broken away from its parent archaeological society to become an independent body dedicated solely to text publication: examples include the [[Surrey Record Society]] and the [[Wiltshire Record Society]].

'''''The Hound of Florence: A Novel''''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Der Hund von Florenz}}) is a 1923 novel written by [[Felix Salten]]. It is best known today for partly inspiring (and even mentioned in) the 1959 [[Walt Disney Pictures]] film, ''[[The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'', as well as a sequel and remakes. The novel was first translated into English in 1930 by [[Huntley Paterson]], and the translation has illustrations by [[Kurt Wiese]].

''The Hound of Florence'' is an adventure story for young readers, set in early eighteenth-century [[Austria]] and Italy. The adolescent Lukas Grassi has lost his parents and lives in [[Vienna]] in great poverty, longs for his native Italy, and would like to study art in [[Florence]]. By magic, his wish is granted, but every other day he must take the form of a dog, Kambyses,&lt;ref&gt;In the English translation, the names are spelled "Lucas Grassi" and "Cambyses."&lt;/ref&gt; that belongs to the Archduke Ludwig; and alternating daily between human and canine form, he travels from Vienna to Florence along with the Archduke's troops, and there has to lead a unique double life. This is the only book of Salten in which [[supernatural]] elements occur, and they may show influence of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ehness | first=Jürgen | title=Felix Saltens erzählerisches Werk: Beschreibung und Deutung | location=Frankfurt am Main | publisher=Peter Lang | date=2002 | isbn=3-631-38178-6 | page=221 | language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has some "overtly" autobiographical background. In 1890s the journalist Salten had become a friend and confidant of the Austrian archduke [[Archduke Leopold Ferdinand of Austria|Leopold Ferdinand]], and in his novel, Salten makes use of his experiences with the archduke and his brothers. He carried the material for twenty-five years before he dared to write the story. In 1907 he mentioned [[Arthur Schnitzler]] that he was then about to finish the manuscript. However it was not until 1921 when the manuscript was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eddy |first=Beverley Driver |date=2010 |title=Felix Salten: Man of Many Faces |location=Riverside (Ca.) |publisher=Ariadne Press |pages=33, 87–89, 131, 195–196, 204–205 |isbn=978-1-57241-169-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain recurring motifs in Saltens œuvre appear also in this book: the deep cleavage between the very rich and the very poor, and the critique of the [[nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehness (2002), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Salten's biographer Beverley Driver Eddy, the strength of ''The Hound of Florence'' lies in the depiction of the dog Kambyses – a "brilliant portrayal of a dog's character."&lt;ref&gt;Eddy (2010), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Salten himself was a passionate dog lover and kept dogs most of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Eddy (2010), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hound of Florence'' is written as one piece. There are no chapter divisions. The 1920s German-language editions, set in [[Fraktur]], however use an embellished dash to divide the text into large sections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Der Hund von Florenz | location=Wien | publisher=Herz-Verlag | date=1923 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1980s edition uses [[asterisk]]s for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Der Hund von Florenz | location=Stuttgart | publisher=Klett-Cotta | isbn=3-608-95400-7 | series=Cotta's Bibliothek der Moderne, 42 | year=1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ending of the book differs greatly in the original language and in the English translation. The German-language version ends in [[tragedy]]: the archduke stabs the dog to death, killing Lukas, and his body is disposed of. In the English translation, a wholly new ending of six more pages&lt;ref&gt;From page 230 on, the English translation diverts from and expands the German text.&lt;/ref&gt; has been written: Lukas survives, gets medication and is united with the [[courtesan]]. Currently it is not known if the alternate ending is authorized.

The English-language edition of ''The Hound of Florence'' was out of print for a long time. Only 2014 was a new edition published, this time illustrated by [[Richard Cowdrey]], using the alternate ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=The Hound of Florence | location=New York | publisher=Aladdin | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-4424-8749-9 | others=Illustrated by Richard Cowdrey }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was translated into [[French language|French]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Le chien de Florence | location=Bruxelles | publisher=Éditions de la Paix | year=1952 | others=Traduit de l’allemand par Maurice Muller-Straus | language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Finnish language|Finnish-language]] edition from 2016 includes both endings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Koiramme Firenzessä | location=Helsinki | publisher=Books on Demand GmbH | date=2016 | isbn=978-952-330-150-4 | language=Finnish | translator=Markus Lång }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Milkmaid''''' (Dutch: ''De Melkmeid'' or ''Het Melkmeisje''), sometimes called ''The Kitchen Maid'', is an [[Oil painting|oil-on-canvas painting]] of a "milkmaid", in fact, a [[Kitchen maid (domestic worker)|domestic kitchen maid]], by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[Johannes Vermeer]]. It is now in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]] in [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands, which regards it as "unquestionably one of the museum's finest attractions".&lt;ref name=Rijksmuseum-Milkmaid&gt;{{cite web |title=The Milkmaid, Johannes Vermeer, c 1660 - Rijksmuseum |url=https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-A-2344|work=[[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]]|accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact year of the painting's completion is unknown, with estimates varying by source. The Rijksmuseum estimates it as circa 1658. According to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, it was painted in about 1657 or 1658.&lt;ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009&gt;{{cite web |title=Vermeer's Masterpiece ''The Milkmaid'' (September 10–November 29, 2009) |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2009/vermeer |work= [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |accessdate=13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Essential Vermeer" website gives a broader range of 1658&amp;ndash;1661.&lt;ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid&gt;{{cite web |title=The Milkmaid by Johannes Vermeer |url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/catalogue/milkmaid.html |work=Essential Vermeer|accessdate=13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Descriptions and commentary ==
Despite its traditional title, the picture clearly shows a kitchen or housemaid, a low-ranking indoor servant, rather than a [[milkmaid]] who actually milks the cow,&lt;ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid /&gt; in a plain room carefully pouring milk into a squat earthenware container on a table. Also on the table are various types of bread. She is a young, sturdily built woman wearing a crisp linen cap, a blue apron and work sleeves pushed up from thick forearms. A foot warmer is on the floor behind her, near [[Delftware|Delft wall tiles]] depicting [[Cupid]] (to the viewer's left) and a figure with a pole (to the right). Intense light streams from the [[window]] on the left side of the canvas.&lt;ref name=krhdcs&gt;{{Cite web

The painting is strikingly [[illusionistic]], conveying not just details but a sense of the weight of the woman and the table. "The light, though bright, doesn't wash out the rough texture of the bread crusts or flatten the volumes of the maid's thick waist and rounded shoulders", wrote Karen Rosenberg, an [[art critic]] for ''[[The New York Times]]''. Yet with half of the woman's face in shadow, it is "impossible to tell whether her downcast eyes and pursed lips express wistfulness or concentration," she wrote.&lt;ref name=krhdcs/&gt;

"It's a little bit of a ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' effect" in modern viewers' reactions to the painting, according to [[Walter Liedtke]], [[curator]] of the department of [[European painting]]s at [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and organizer of two Vermeer exhibits. "There's a bit of mystery about her for modern audiences. She is going about her daily task, faintly smiling. And our reaction is 'What is she thinking?'"&lt;ref name=CTPost-Met-2009&gt;{{Cite web | last = Boros | first = Phyllis A.S. | date = 13 September 2009| title = Vermeer's 'Milkmaid' cause for celebration at MMA | work = [[Connecticut Post]] | url = http://www.ctpost.com/default/article/Vermeer-s-Milkmaid-cause-for-celebration-at-MMA-212061.php | accessdate =  13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch iconography of maids===
[[File:Vermeer, Johannes, The Milkmaid (about 1657-58).jpg|thumb|left|350px|Painting detail showing the foot warmer, with tiles of [[Cupid]] and a man with a pole on either side of it; the clothes basket Vermeer removed from the painting was here. Also shown is a detail from the maid's brilliant blue apron.]]

The woman would have been known as a "kitchen maid" or [[maid|maid-of-all-work]] rather than a specialised "[[milkmaid]]" at the time the painting was created: "milk maids" were women who milked cows; kitchen maids worked in kitchens.&lt;ref name=CTPost-Met-2009/&gt; For at least two centuries before the painting was created, milkmaids and kitchen maids had a reputation as being predisposed to love or sex, and this was [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Scenes of everyday life|frequently reflected in Dutch paintings]] of kitchen and market scenes from [[Antwerp]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and Delft.&lt;ref&gt;See Schama, Chapter 6 on the housemaid, "the most dangerous women of all" (p. 455). See also Franits, 118-119 and 166, and the other passages under "maids, sterotypes" in his index.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the paintings were slyly suggestive, like ''The Milkmaid'', others more coarsely so.&lt;ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/&gt;

The leading artists in this tradition were the Antwerp painters [[Joachim Beuckelaer]] (c. 1535–1575) and [[Frans Snyders]] (1579–1657), who had many followers and imitators, as well as [[Pieter Aertsen]] (who, like Beukelaer, had clients in Delft), the Utrecht [[Mannerist]] painter [[Joachim Wtewael]] (1566–1638), and his son, [[Peter Wtewael]] (1596–1660).&lt;ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=delftschool/&gt;  Closer to Vermeer's day, [[Nicolaes Maes]] painted several comic pictures now given titles such as ''The Lazy Servant''.  However by this time there was an alternative convention of painting women at work in the home as exemplars of Dutch domestic virtue, dealt with at length by [[Simon Schama]].&lt;ref&gt;Schama, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dutch literature and paintings of Vermeer's time, maids were often depicted as subjects of male desire—dangerous women threatening the honor and security of the home, the center of Dutch life—although some Vermeer contemporaries, such as [[Pieter de Hooch]], had started to represent them in a more neutral way, as did [[Michael Sweerts]]. Vermeer's painting is one of the rare examples of a maid treated in an empathetic and dignified way,&lt;ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/&gt; although amorous symbols in this work still exemplify the tradition.&lt;ref name=CTPost-Met-2009/&gt;

Other painters in this tradition, such as [[Gerard Dou|Gerrit Dou]] (1613–1675), depicted attractive maids with symbolic objects such as jugs and various forms of game and produce.&lt;ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/&gt; "In almost all the works of this tradition there is an erotic element, which is conveyed through gestures ranging from jamming chickens onto spits to gently offering &amp;mdash; or so the direction of view suggests &amp;mdash; an intimate glimpse of some vaguely uterine object," according to Liedtke. In Dou's 1646 painting, ''Girl Chopping Onions'' (now in the British [[Royal Collection]]), a pewter tankard may refer to both male and female anatomy, and the picture contains other contemporary symbols of lust, such as onions (said to have aphrodisical properties), and a dangling bird. Milk also had lewd connotations, from the slang term ''melken'', defined as "to sexually attract or lure" (a meaning that may have originated from watching farm girls working under cows, according to Liedtke). Examples of works using milk this way include [[Lucas van Leyden]]'s [[engraving]] ''The Milkmaid'' (1510) and [[Jacques de Gheyn II]]'s engraving ''The Archer and the Milkmaid'' (about 1610).&lt;ref name=delftschool/&gt; 
[[File:Gerrit Dou 1646 painting Girl Chopping Onions.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Gerrit Dou]], ''Girl Chopping Onions'']]

Vermeer's painting is even more understated, although the use of symbols remains: one of the Delft tiles at the foot of the wall behind the maid, near the foot warmer, depicts Cupid &amp;ndash; which can imply arousal of a woman&lt;ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/&gt; or simply that while she is working she is daydreaming about a man.&lt;ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009 /&gt; Other amorous symbols in the painting include a wide-mouthed jug, often used as a symbol of the female anatomy. The foot warmer was often used by artists as a symbol for female sexual arousal because, when placed under a skirt, it heats the whole body below the waist, according to Liedtke.&lt;ref name=CTPost-Met-2009/&gt; The coals enclosed inside the foot warmer could symbolize "either the heat of lust in tavern or brothel scenes, or the hidden but true burning passion of a woman for her husband", according to Serena Cant, a British art historian and lecturer. Yet the whitewashed wall and presence of milk seem to indicate that the room was a "cool kitchen" used for cooking with dairy products, such as milk and butter, so the foot warmer would have a pragmatic purpose there. Since other Dutch paintings of the period indicate that foot warmers were used when seated, its presence in the picture may symbolize the standing woman's "hardworking nature", according to Cant.&lt;ref name=Cant-VermeerHisWorld-2009&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Cant | first1 = Serena| last2=Vermeer van Delft| first2=Jan | year = 2009 | title = Vermeer and His World 1632&amp;ndash;1675 | publisher = Quercus Publishing Plc | location=London|ISBN = 978-1-849-16005-6|OCLC=699202293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is part of a social context of the sexual or romantic interactions of maids and men of higher social ranks that has now disappeared in Europe and never commonly recognized in America, according to Liedtke, who offers as an example Vermeer's contemporary, [[Samuel Pepys]], whose diary records encounters with kitchen maids, oyster girls and, at an inn during a 1660 visit to Delft, with "an exceedingly pretty lass and right for the sport". The painting was first owned by (and may have been painted for) Pieter van Ruijven, owner of several other paintings by Vermeer which also depicted attractive young women and with themes of desire and self-denial quite different from the attitude of Pepys and many of the paintings in the Dutch "kitchenmaid" tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Liedtke, Walter, et al., ''Vermeer and the Delft School'', New Haven and London:[[Yale University Press]], 2001, p. 372; citing Samuel Pepys' ''Diary'', entry for May 19, 1660&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dutch, ''Het Melkmeisje'' is the painting's most-used name. Although this title is less accurate in modern Dutch, the word "meid" (maid) has gained a negative tone that is not present in its [[diminutive]] form ("meisje")—hence the use of the more friendly title for the work, used by the Rijksmuseum and others.

===Narrative and thematic elements===
According to art historian Harry Rand, the painting suggests the woman is making [[bread pudding]], which would account for the milk and the broken pieces of bread on the table. Rand assumed she would have already made [[custard]] in which the bread mixed with egg would be soaking at the moment depicted in the painting. She pours milk into the Dutch oven to cover the mixture because otherwise the bread, if not simmering in liquid while it is baking, will become an unappetizing, dry crust instead of forming the typical upper surface of the pudding. She is careful in pouring the trickle of milk because bread pudding can be ruined when the ingredients are not accurately measured or properly combined.&lt;ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/&gt;

By depicting the working maid in the act of careful cooking, the artist presents not just a picture of an everyday scene, but one with ethical and social value. The humble woman is using common ingredients and otherwise useless stale bread to create a pleasurable product for the household. "Her measured demeanor, modest dress and judiciousness in preparing her food conveys eloquently yet unobtrusively one of the strongest values of 17th-century Netherlands, domestic virtue", according to the Essential Vermeer website.&lt;ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/&gt;

"In the end, it is not the allusions to female sexuality that give this painting its romance or emotional resonance &amp;mdash; it is the depiction of honest, hard work as something romantic in and of itself," Raquel Laneri wrote in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine. "''The Milkmaid'' elevates the drudgery of housework and servitude to virtuous, even heroic, levels."&lt;ref name=Forbes-MetMuseum-2009&gt;{{Cite web | last = Laneri | first = Raquel | date = 12 September 2009| title = Vermeer's Timeless Heroine – A New Exhibit Recasts the Enduring Appeal of the Dutch Master's 'Milkmaid' | work = [[Forbes]] | url = https://www.forbes.com/2009/09/11/vermeer-milkmaid-amsterdam-new-york-opinions-contributors-art.html | accessdate = 13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compositional strategy ===
An impression of monumentality and "perhaps a sense of dignity" is lent to the image by the artist's choice of a relatively low vantage point and a pyramidal building up of forms from the left foreground to the woman's head, according to a web page of The Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/&gt; According to the Rijksmuseum, the painting "is built up along two diagonal lines. They meet by the woman's right wrist." This focuses the attention of the viewer on the pouring of the milk.&lt;ref name=Rijksmuseum-Milkmaid /&gt;

The photograph-like realism of the painting resembles that of Leiden artists such as Dou, [[Frans van Mieris the Elder|Frans van Mieris]], and [[Gabriël Metsu]].&lt;ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/&gt; Vermeer, who was age twenty-five when he painted this work, was "shopping around in Dutch art for different styles and subjects", according to Liedtke. "He's looking, in this case, mainly at artists like Gerrit Dou and others who work in a meticulous, illusionistic way." Liedtke sees the work as either Vermeer's "last early work or first mature work". The curator added, "I almost think he had to explore what you might call 'tactile illusionism' to understand where he really wanted to go, which was in the more optical, light-filled direction."&lt;ref name=WNYC-Lopate-Liedtke-2009&gt;{{cite web |title=Vermeer's The Milkmaid |url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/59185-vermeers-the-milkmaid/ 
|date= 19 September 2009|last=Lopate|first=Leonard |work=[[The Leonard Lopate Show]] |publisher=[[WNYC]] radio station |format=Audio interview with [[Walter Liedtke]]|accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristic of Delft artistry and of Vermeer's work, the painting also has a "classic balance" of figurative elements and an "extraordinary treatment of light", according to The Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/&gt; The wall on the left, according to Liedtke, "gets you very quickly in the picture&amp;mdash;that recession from the left and then the openness to the right&amp;mdash;and this sort of left-corner scheme was used for about 10 years before Vermeer, and he was very quick to pick up the latest thing."&lt;ref name=WNYC-Lopate-Liedtke-2009/&gt;

"Nowhere else in his oeuvre does one find such a sculptural figure and such seemingly tangible objects, and yet the future painter of luminous interiors has already arrived," according to the museum. The "''[[pointillé]]'' pattern of bright dots on the bread and basket" are the "most effusive" use of that scheme in any Vermeer painting, and it appears to be used to suggest "scintillating daylight and rough textures at the same time."&lt;ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/&gt;

Vermeer painted over two items originally in the painting. One was a large wall map (a Rijksmuseum web page calls it a painting)&lt;ref name=Rijksmuseum-Milkmaid/&gt; behind the upper part of the woman's body. (A wall map may not have been very out of place in a humble workroom such as the cold kitchen where the maid toiled: large maps in 17th-century Holland were inexpensive ways of decorating bare walls.)&lt;ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/&gt; He originally placed a large, conspicuous clothes basket (the Rijksmuseum web page calls it a "sewing basket")&lt;ref name=Rijksmuseum-Milkmaid/&gt; near the bottom of the painting, behind the maid's red skirt, but then the artist painted it over, producing the slight shift in tone ([[pentimento]]) on the wall behind the foot warmer. The basket was later discovered with an [[X-ray]]. Other Vermeer paintings also have images removed. Some art critics have thought the removals may have been intended to provide the works with better thematic focus.&lt;ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/&gt;

"[I]ts rustic immediacy differs from Vermeer's later paintings," according to Laneri. "There is a tactile, visceral quality to ''The Milkmaid'' &amp;mdash; you can almost taste the thick, creamy milk escaping the jug, feel the cool dampness of the room and the starchy linen of the maid's white cap, touch her sculptural shoulders and corseted waist. She is not an apparition or abstraction. She is not the ideal, worldly housewife of Vermeer's later ''[[Woman with a Water Jug|Young Woman with a Water Pitcher]]'' or the ethereal beauty in ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]''. She is not the cartoonish buxom vixen in Leyden's drawing. She is real &amp;mdash; as real as a painting can get anyway."&lt;ref name=Forbes-MetMuseum-2009/&gt;

=== Technique and materials ===
This painting has "perhaps, the most brilliant color scheme of his oeuvre", according to the Essential Vermeer website. Already in the 18th century, English painter and critic [[Joshua Reynolds]] praised the work for its striking quality.&lt;ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/&gt; One of the distinctions of Vermeer's [[Palette (painting)|palette]], compared with his contemporaries, was his preference for the expensive natural [[ultramarine]] (made from crushed [[lapis lazuli]]) where other painters typically used the much cheaper [[azurite]]. Along with the ultramarine, [[lead-tin-yellow]] is also a dominant color in an exceptionally luminous work (with a much less somber and conventional rendering of light than any of Vermeer's previous extant works).&lt;ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/&gt; Depicting white walls was a challenge for artists in Vermeer's time, with his contemporaries using various forms of gray pigment. Here the white walls reflect the daylight with different intensities, displaying the effects of uneven textures on the plastered surfaces. The artist here used [[white lead]], [[umber]] and [[charcoal black]]. Although the formula was widely known among Vermeer's contemporary genre painters, "perhaps no artist more than Vermeer was able to use it so effectively", according to the Essential Vermeer website.&lt;ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/&gt;

The woman's coarse features are painted with thick dabs of ''[[impasto]]''. The seeds on the crust of the bread, as well as the crust itself, along with the plaited handles of the bread basket, are rendered with ''pointillé'' dots. Soft parts of the bread are rendered with thin swirls of paint, with dabs of [[ochre]] used to show the rough edges of broken crust. One piece of bread to the viewer's right and close to the Dutch oven, has a broad band of yellow, different from the crust, which Cant believes is a suggestion that the piece is going stale. The small roll at the far right has thick impastoed dots that resemble a knobbly crust or a crust with seeds on it. The bread and basket, despite being closer to the viewer, are painted in a more diffuse way than the illusionistic realism of the wall, with its stains, shadowing, nail and nail hole, or the seams and fastenings of the woman's dress, the gleaming, polished brass container hanging from the wall. The panes of glass in the window are varied in a very realistic way, with a crack in one (fourth row from the bottom, far right) reflected on the wood of the window frame. Just below that pane, another has a scratch, indicated with a thin white line. Another pane (second row from the bottom, second from right) is pushed inward within its frame.&lt;ref name=Cant-VermeerHisWorld-2009/&gt;

The discrepancy between objects at various distances from the viewer may indicate Vermeer used a ''[[camera obscura]]'', according to Cant.&lt;ref name=Cant-VermeerHisWorld-2009/&gt; Liedtke points out that a pinhole discovered in the canvas "has really punctured the theory of the ''camera obscura'' [...] The idea that Vermeer traced compositions in an optical device [...] is rather naive when you consider that the light lasts maybe 10 seconds, but the painting took at least months to paint." Instead, The pin in the canvas would have been tied to a string with chalk on it, which the painter would have snapped to get perspective lines, Liedtke said in a 2009 interview.&lt;ref name=WNYC-Lopate-Liedtke-2009 /&gt;

The woman's bulky green oversleeves were painted with the same yellow and blue paint used in the rest of the woman's clothing, worked at the same time in a [[wet-on-wet]] method. Broad strokes in the painting of the clothing suggests coarse, thick texture of the work clothing. The blue cuff uses a lighter mixture of ultramarine and lead-white, together with a layer of ochre painted beneath it. The brilliant blue of the skirt or apron has been intensified with a glaze (a thin, transparent top layer) of the same color. The glazing helps suggest that the blue material is a less coarse fabric than the yellow bodice, according to Cant.&lt;ref name=Cant-VermeerHisWorld-2009/&gt;

== Provenance ==
[[File:CartoonsDeMinisterPRinkEnDeMilkmaid1907.jpg|thumb|350px|A 1907 Dutch cartoon by Jan Rinke, reflecting a controversy over whether the state should purchase the painting rather than let it possibly fall into the hands of some rich American art collector. The government bought the work for the [[Rijksmuseum]].]]
[[Pieter van Ruijven]] (1624–1674), Vermeer's patron in Delft (and, at his death, the owner of twenty-one of the painter's works), probably bought the painting directly from the artist.

In 1765 the painting was auctioned by [[Leendert Pieter de Neufville]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibliotheque-numerique.inha.fr/collection/13744-catalogus-van-schilderyen-van-wylen-de-heer-pieter/ Catalogue of paintings by the late Pieter de Neufville, nr. 65]&lt;/ref&gt; "The famous milkmaid, by Vermeer of Delft, artful", went through at least five Amsterdam collections before it became part of what The Metropolitan Museum of Art called "one of the great collectors of Dutch art", that of [[Lucretia Johanna van Winter]] (1785–1845). In 1822 she married into the [[Six family]] of collectors, and in 1908 her two sons sold the painting (as part of the famous Six collection of thirty-nine works) to the Rijksmuseum, which acquired the works with support from the Dutch government and the [[Rembrandt Society]]&lt;ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/&gt; &amp;mdash; but not before a good deal of public squabbling and the intervention of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States-General]] or Dutch parliament.&lt;ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
The painting has been exhibited in western Europe and in the United States. In 1872 it was part of an Amsterdam exhibition of "[[old masters]]" ("Tentoonstelling van zeldzame en belangrijke schilderijen van oude meesters"), for Arti et Amicitiae, a society of visual artists and art lovers, and in 1900 it was part of an exhibition at [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]]. Other European exhibits showing the work include the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] ("Exhibition of Dutch Art", London) in 1929; [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]] ("Exposition hollandaise: Tableaux, aquarelles et dessíns anciens et modernes", Paris) in 1921; [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] ("Vermeer, oorsprong en invloed: Fabritius, De Hooch, De Witte", Rotterdam) in 1935.&lt;ref name=delftschool/&gt;

It was exhibited at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|1939 World's Fair]] in New York City,&lt;ref name=HuffPo-MetMuseum-2009&gt;{{cite news |agency= [[Associated Press]]| date = 14 August 2009 | title = "Vermeer's 'Milkmaid' to Be Loaned to NYC Museum" | work = [[Huffington Post]] | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20090812/us-vermeer-exhibition/ | accessdate = 13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the outbreak of World War II during the fair – with the German occupation of the Netherlands – caused the work to remain in the U.S. until Holland was liberated. During this time it was displayed at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] in [[Michigan]] (the museum where the curator of the World's Fair exhibit was working), and was included in that museum's exhibition catalogues in 1939 and 1941. During the war, the work was also displayed at The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, where it was hanging as late as 1944, according to Leidtke.&lt;ref name=WNYC-Lopate-Liedtke-2009/&gt; In 1953, the [[Kunsthaus Zürich]] displayed the painting in an exhibition, and the next year it traveled to Italy for an exhibition at the [[Palazzo delle Esposizioni]] in Rome and the [[Palazzo Reale]] in Milan. In 1966, it was part of an exhibition at the [[Mauritshuis]] in the Hague and the [[Musée de l'Orangerie]] in Paris. In 1999 and 2000 the painting was at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington for its exhibition "Johannes Vermeer: The Art of Painting", and it was part of the "Vermeer and the Delft School" exhibition at the [[National Gallery]], London from June 20 to September 16, 2001 (it did not appear at the Metropolitan Museum of Art venue of that exhibition, earlier that year).&lt;ref name=delftschool/&gt;

The painting returned to New York in 2009, on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of [[Henry Hudson]]'s historic voyage (Amsterdam to Manhattan), where it was the central feature of a Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition, alongside several of the museum's five Vermeer works and other [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]s.

The painting was exhibited online in a high-quality digital version after museum curators found that many people thought that a low-quality yellowed version of the image which was circulating on the Internet was a good reproduction of the image.&lt;ref name=Europeana-Yellow-2011&gt;{{cite web |url= http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/858566/2cbf1f78-e036-4088-af25-94684ff90dc5 |title=The Problem of the Yellow Milkmaid |first1=Harry |last1=Verwayen |first2=Martijn |last2=Arnoldus |first3=Peter B. |last3=Kaufman |work=[[Europeana Foundation]] |format=PDF|date=November 2011 |accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cahn Auditorium Northwestern University.jpg|thumb|The Waa-Mu Show is held in Cahn Auditorium at Northwestern University]]'''The Waa-Mu Show''' (pronounced "wah mew") is a non-profit [[501(c)(3)]] organization within [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, IL]], that produces student written, orchestrated, produced, and performed original [[musical theatre]] work every year. The song lyrics, script, and music are developed in a series of classes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/evanston/lifestyles/ct-evr-go-waamu-show-tl-0421-20160429-story.html|title=Northwestern's Waa-Mu show takes to the Oregon Trail|last=Petlicki|first=Myrna|date=|work=|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2016-10-21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the institution's longest standing theatrical tradition and is held in [[Cahn Auditorium]] on Northwestern's campus. This tradition began as a [[musical revue]], showcasing several different student-written Northwestern-inspired vignettes connected by one single theme.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://waamushow.org|title=Waa-Mu Show|website=waamushow.org|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last six years, the Waa-Mu show has evolved into an original full-length musical.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.communication.northwestern.edu/waamu|title=The 86th Annual Waa-Mu Show {{!}} Northwestern University School of Communication|website=www.communication.northwestern.edu|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first Waa-Mu show took place in 1929. A senior Northwestern student Joseph W. Miller and his classmate [[Darrell Ware]] wrote the script and staged the college musical comedy that became "The Waa-Mu Show," the first co-educational college musical show. The Women's Athletic Association (WAA) and the Men's Union (MU) collaborated to put on the first show. The name "Waa-Mu" is derived from the synthesis of the two groups' acronyms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The WAA had been staging popular all-female musical comedies since 1912; the MU had presented less successful all-male comic operas for a number of years prior to 1929. Both men's and women's shows had been losing money and Miller and Ware raised $1,200 by borrowing $5 a piece from interested students to finance the first show. It also was Miller's and Ware's idea to feature both male and female students in their premiere production.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At first, the female WAA committee was reluctant about sharing the stage with the male Mu members, but they eventually agreed to combine talents. The premiere show that Miller and Ware collaborated on was ''Good Morning Glory.''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  ''[[The Daily Northwestern]]'' wrote, "Campus interest is the highest yet for any single dramatic activity in University history." This review prompted the producers to begin formulating and writing the following year's show. [[Walter Kerr]] was the principal writer for the 1936 musical revue entitled ''It Goes to Show''. Kerr graduated the following year and eventually become a famous theatre critic for the ''[[New York Times]]''. After graduating in 1929, Joe Miller stayed at Northwestern to do graduate work in personnel administration, and Darrell Ware went to Hollywood to write screenplays. In 1931 Northwestern president [[Walter Dill Scott]] offered Miller a position on the university's staff as Freshman Advisor and Waa-Mu Director.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nu150.northwestern.edu/news/stories/03_29_01_waa-mu.html|title=Waa-Mu: Northwestern's long-running version of Star Search|last=Moore|first=Judy|date=March 29, 2001|website=Northwestern Observer|publisher=|access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, Waa-Mu board members were not pleased with that year's student-written script. Instead, they staged [[George Gershwin]]'s musical ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'', about a presidential candidate who promises to bring more love to the White House. Actor [[Tony Randall]] (who was then known as Leonard Rosenberg), portrayed a boisterous Texas congressman in the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=To the memories: A history of the Northwestern University Waa-Mu Show, 1929-1980|last=Morledge|first=Kirk|publisher=Evanston, Ill. : The University|year=1980|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only three times in Waa-Mu's history has non-original material been presented; in 1935 with [[Ray Henderson]]'s musical [[Good News (musical)|''Good News'']], in 1938, with [[George Gershwin]]'s musical ''[[Of Thee I Sing]],'' and in 1993 with [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s musical [[On the Town (musical)|''On the Town'']].

Waa-Mu went on hiatus during the [[World War II]] years, but was re-launched in 1946. During the three-year break, profits from previous Waa-Mu productions were invested in war bonds. Miller directed the Waa-Mu Show until 1975; his last show was ''Quick Change''. He retired on August 31, 1975 and died in 1979. Tom Roland succeeded Miller as the second director of the Waa-Mu productions in 1976. Occasionally, Waa-Mu has been performed off-campus. The show traveled to Chicago several times after its Evanston run, most notably in 1931 (at the Civic Theatre in Chicago) and 1933. And renowned orchestra leader [[Fred Waring]] played original Waa-Mu songs on the radio in 1951.

Waa-Mu performances have been presented at [[Cahn Auditorium]] since its 1941 production, ''Wait A Minute'', premiering on the new stage the same year that [[Scott Hall]] was completed. Before performances began in Cahn Auditorium, Waa-Mu productions were held at and around the Evanston area, at the New Evanston Theatre and the National College of Education.

== Statements of the Organization ==
Mission Statement: The Waa-Mu Show aims to share stories that engage the hearts and minds of Northwestern's campus as well as that of the greater community. The Waa-Mu Show aspires to give students an unparalleled experience that prepares them to lead and advance the world of musical theatre.

Values Statement: The 2017-2018 Co-Chairs aim to facilitate a world class educational opportunity in the writing, performance, and administration of new musical theatre. In doing so, we also strive to foster an inclusive and collaborative community that allows students to learn from one another, while making memories that will last a lifetime.

== Organization ==
Several different positions and sub-groups with distinct responsibilities exist within the institution to ease the process of creating an original musical each year. They include:

'''Program Head:''' A staff member of the [[Theatre &amp; Interpretation Center]] who leads the creation process and makes all final decisions. The Program Head is typically the director of the production as well.

'''Co-Chairs:''' The student leaders of the organization who work alongside the Program Head to make decisions about creative and administrative matters.

'''Head Writers:''' The student leaders who are in charge of generating and combining material to form a cohesive script for the show.

'''Executive Board:''' A group of students who work under the Co-Chairs to handle all administrative, financial and organizational needs.

'''Creating the Musical Class:''' A large group of students enrolled in a winter class who generate material for the show including: the script, songs, and lyrics.

'''Orchestrating the Musical Class:''' A group of students enrolled in a winter class who generate orchestrations for the show; many of whom go on to join Team Music.

'''Team Music:''' A group of students led by the [[Music Director]] that creates all of the orchestrations for the songs generated in the Creating the Musical class as well as the incidental music and overture.

== Recent Performances ==
=== ''Another Way West'' ===
The 2016 performance was titled ''Another Way West''. The story follows a female researcher, accompanied by her nieces and nephews, on the [[Oregon Trail]] searching for her late ancestor. This show merges the journeys of both the researcher and her ancestor on the [[Oregon Trail]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== ''Gold'' ===
In 2015, the students put on ''Gold,'' based on the [[Berlin Olympics|1936 Olympics]]. The plot centered around journalists sent to report about the Olympics, specifically focusing on the US Basketball Team, the US Swim Team, and the US Track and Field Team. Opening night for the show was May 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dailynorthwestern.com/2015/04/30/campus/84th-waa-mu-show-set-to-open-friday/|title=84th Waa-Mu Show set to open Friday|last=Choi|first=Matthew|website=The Daily Northwestern|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Double Feature at Hollywood and Vine'', an adaptation of ''Twelfth Night'' ===
Inspired by the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] play, ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', the 2014 Waa-Mu Show was ''Double Feature at Hollywood and Vine''. The protagonist, Viola, disguises herself as a man in order to find fame as an actor in the 1930s. Opening night for the show was May 2, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dailynorthwestern.com/2014/04/30/thecurrent/waa-mu-celebrates-83-years-by-breaking-some-traditions-honoring-others/|title=Waa-Mu celebrates 83 years by breaking some traditions, honoring others|last=Rense|first=Sarah|website=The Daily Northwestern|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Flying Home'' ===
The performance in 2013 entitled, ''Flying Home,'' combined the ideas of three very well known productions, ''[[Peter Pan]]'', ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', and ''[[Adaptations of The Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]''. The main theme of this production is about adolescents leaving home and developing throughout college. Opening night for this performance was May 3, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dailynorthwestern.com/2013/05/14/thecurrent/waa-mus-flying-home-whisks-seniors-off-with-fantastic-style/|title=Waa-Mu's 'Flying Home' whisks seniors off with fantastic style|last=Caiola|first=Sammy|website=The Daily Northwestern|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thorsten Goldberg''' born 1960 in [[Dinslaken]] is a German [[multimedia]] artist.

== Life ==

From 1982 to 1991 Thorsten Goldberg studied sculpture at the [[State Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart]] in the class of Inge Mahn. 
In 1991 he won the first prize of the Forum of Young Art for his photographic work, "Class of 97" with exhibition stations at Kunsthalle Kiel, Kunstverein Mannheim, [[Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg]], Württembergischer Kunstverein Stuttgart and Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden. 
Along with the screenwriter Wieland Bauder he created the fictional character Thomas Bauer for joint artistic performances. When Thomas Bauer received the scholarship for photography by the Berlin Senate in 1991, he then took part in the art exhibition “Art on a world scale” at the Kunsthalle Kiel in 1993. 
Since 1995 and in addition to photographs and video works Thorsten Goldberg has been creating site-specific works and public art. He realized numerous projects in public space throughout Germany, in Poland, Norway and Canada and taught at various academies. 2003 - 2008 he was Adjunct Professor for Art in Public Space at the Art Academy Linz/AT and 2007 - 2009 Professor (repress.) for arts and media at the Muthesius Art Academy Kiel/Germany.

As a member of different committees and advisory boards he is involved in the election and organisation of competitions for art in public. 
Thorsten Goldberg is Initiator and Co-Publisher of „Public Art Wiki“, a Germany-wide internet archive for art in public space in the German-speaking-area (http://www.publicartwiki.org)
He is also Co-Publisher of „Kunst in der Großsiedlung (art in the large-housing-area) Marzahn-Hellersdorf“ a printed documentation of more than 460 public works and author of several texts on public art.

'''Three Old Arches''' is a building at 48&amp;nbsp;Bridge Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  Together with the adjacent building at No.&amp;nbsp;50, it is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=images&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376095|desc= Nos.48 &amp; 50 Street and Nos.48, 50 &amp; 52 Row (Three Old Arches), Chester|accessdate= 11 April 2015|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The buildings incorporate part of the [[Chester Rows]].  The stone frontage at the street and row levels of No.&amp;nbsp;48 is considered to be the earliest shop front still surviving in England.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.virtualchester.org/view/view_location.php?id=20| title = Three Old Arches| accessdate = 18 July 2009| publisher = Chester City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last= Langtree|editor1-first= Stephen|editor2-last= Comyns|editor2-first= Alan| year = 2001| title = 2000 Years of Building: Chester's Architectural Legacy| publication-place = Chester| place = | publisher = Chester Civic Trust| pages = | page = 68| format = | id = | isbn = 0-9540152-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was once the largest known medieval town house in the Chester Rows, and the stone-walled hall at the row level extending to No.&amp;nbsp;50 was the largest hall set parallel to the rows in Chester.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;

==History==

The building was constructed in the 13th&amp;nbsp;century.  During the 14th&amp;nbsp;century it was extended to the south (into what is now No.&amp;nbsp;50), when the hall, set parallel to the rows, was built.  During the 20th&amp;nbsp;century part of the building was used by William Jones, a grocer.  In the 1960s the business was taken over by the [[department store]] of [[Owen Owen]], but this closed in 1999.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  The ground floor continues to be used as a shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ukcities.co.uk/Chester/Shopping_and_Retail/Fashion_and_Clothing/| title = Chester Clothing | accessdate = 26 July 2009| publisher = UK Cities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

===Exterior===
At the level of the row are three round-headed [[chamfer]]ed arches, the [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] of which pass down to the ground level, at the sides of the windows and entrance of the shop at this level.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;  Above the arches, in [[Blackletter|Gothic script]], is the inscription "Three Old Arches".  Duplicated at the tops of the piers, between the arches, is the date "1274&amp;nbsp;AD".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.virtualchester.org/view/view_image.php?id=31| title = Three Old Arches - Photograph | accessdate = 18 July 2009| publisher = Chester City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Above the arches are three [[sash window]]s, each with 12&amp;nbsp;panes and, in the top storey is another sash window, this one being tripartite, with 4:12:4 panes.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

===Interior===
In the [[undercroft]] of No.&amp;nbsp;48, the original stone pillars have been replaced by [[cast iron]] columns. The undercroft of No.&amp;nbsp;50 retains its original stone arch. Much of the medieval stone hall remains at the level of the row, which extends between Nos.&amp;nbsp;48 and 50.&lt;ref name=images/&gt; It is the largest stone-walled hall set parallel with the row in Chester, measuring over 12m by over 8m, and it contains four medieval doorways.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  The hall also contains a 16th&amp;nbsp;century open fireplace with a 19th&amp;nbsp;century cast iron [[Kitchen stove|range]].&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

'''UNIMA''' (''Union Internationale de la Marionnette'' - ''International Puppetry Association'') was founded in [[Prague]] in 1929 (the then Czechoslovak magazine [[Loutkář]] was UNIMA's first official journal in years 1929-1930). In 1981, the French puppeteer Jacques Félix moved UNIMA's headquarters to [[Charleville-Mézières]], [[France]], location of the ''Festival Mondial des Théâtres de Marionnettes'' since 1972. UNIMA is affiliated to [[UNESCO]] and it is a member of the [[International Theatre Institute]].

'''Willem van de Velde the Elder''' (c. 1611 – 13 December 1693) was a [[Dutch Golden Age]] seascape painter.

==Biographical Outline==
Willem van de Velde, known as the Elder, a marine draughtsman and painter, was born in Leiden, the son of a Flemish skipper, Willem Willemsz. van de Velde, and is commonly said to have been bred to the sea. In 1706 Bainbrigg Buckeridge noted that he “understood navigation very well”. He married Judith Adriaensdochter van Leeuwen in Leiden, the Netherlands, in 1631.

His three known legitimate children were named Magdalena, born 1632; [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|Willem, known as the Younger]], also a marine painter, born 1633; and Adriaen, a landscape painter, born 1636.

His marriage was stormy, at least in its later years. David Cordingly relates that Willem the Elder fathered two children out of wedlock in 1653, one “by his maidservant, and the other by her friend. Nine years later the Elder and his wife went through a legal separation, ‘on account of legal disputes and the most violent quarrels’. The immediate cause of the dispute was his affair with a married woman.” [[Michael S. Robinson]] noted that  “on 17/27 July 1662, he and his wife agreed to part. A condition of the separation was that the Elder could recover from his son Adriaen ‘two royal gifts’, presumably gifts from [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] for work done in England.”  Cordingly’s account further relates that the dispute was still continuing after another ten years, since “in the autumn of 1672 Judith complained to the woman’s husband.” Robinson adds that by 1674 the couple “must have been reconciled”, for at a chance meeting with Pieter Blaeu in Amsterdam in July the Elder explained that he was only visiting for a few days “in order to fetch his wife”.  His son, Adriaen, had died in Amsterdam in 1672, and Willem the Elder was also fetching his grandson, similarly named Adriaen, who was then aged two.

After his move to England, the exact date of which is uncertain, but reportedly at the end of 1672 or beginning of 1673, he is said to have lived with his family in East Lane, Greenwich, and to have used the Queen’s House, now part of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, as a studio. Following the accession of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] as King and Queen of England, it appears that this facility was no longer provided, and by 1691 he was living in [[Sackville Street (London)|Sackville Street]], now close to Piccadilly Circus. He died in London, and was buried in [[St James's Church, Piccadilly|St James’s Church]], at the south end of the street.

==Professional career==

He was the official artist of the Dutch fleet for a period, being present at the [[Four Days Battle]], 1–4 June 1666, and the [[St James's Day Battle]], 25 July 1666, to make sketches.
In his work on the biographies of artists, [[Arnold Houbraken]] quotes [[Gerard Brandt]]'s biography of Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Link language|nl}}&lt;!--Middle Dutch--&gt; [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/houb005groo01_01/houb005groo01_01_0165.htm Willem vanden Velde biography] in ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' (1718) by [[Arnold Houbraken]], courtesy of the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]]&lt;/ref&gt; relating the anecdote where Willem van de Velde asked Admiral de Ruyter permission to have a [[galley]] row him around for a good view of the proceedings on the evening of the Four Days battle in 1666. He wasn't the only artist to paint the scenes of this battle, his son, [[Ludolf Bakhuysen]] and [[Pieter Cornelisz van Soest]] also made paintings of it.
This act later was the reason that van Velde gained his marine commission in London. The date, 1672, commonly given for his entry into the service of [[Charles II of England]], was at a time when the [[Dutch Republic]] was at war with England ([[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]).

:''This article is about women as subjects of art. For women creating art in the Philippines, see [[Filipino women artists]].''
'''Women in Philippine art''' is the many forms of [[art in the Philippines]] that utilizes [[women in the Philippines]] and even women from other parts of the world as the main subject depending on the purpose of the Filipino artist. The portrayal of women in the visual arts depend on the context on how Philippine society perceives women and their roles in human communities, such as their own.

==Women in paintings==
In the field of painting, Filipino visual artists depicted women in their painting as women who are influential and with authority, women who are engaged in domestic activities, and women who are shown to be under the control of influential [[men in the Philippines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tarroza|first=Ma. Abigail|title=Eva: Women in Philippine Art|url=https://www.academia.edu/3999369/Eva_Women_in_Philippine_Art|publisher=Academia.edu|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or foreign men.

===Amorsolo's women===

In painting the faces and figures of Filipino women, [[Philippine National Artist]] [[Fernando Amorsolo]] (1892-1972) was able to develop  his own template on how to paint and create Filipino women in his art: women with rounded faces but not oval, with "exceptionally lively eyes" (not dreamy or sleepy), with "firm and strongly marked" noses (not blunt in form), with clear skin and fresh color, not necessarily of white complexion nor of dark brown [[Ethnic Malays|Malayan]] color. Amorsolo painted Filipino women that is similar to the stature of a  "[[blushing]]" girl.&lt;ref name=Paras&gt;Paras-Perez, Rodriguez. ''Amorsolo Drawings'' ([http://www.lopezmuseum.org.ph/gallery_amorsolo.html excerpt available online]) (1992), {{oclc|29416198}}. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903235159/http://www.lopezmuseum.org.ph/gallery_amorsolo.html |date=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luna's women===
[[File:Espana y Filipinas by Juan Luna.jpg|thumb|110px|right|''España y Filipinas'' (1886) by [[Juan Luna]]]]
In contrast, Filipino painter, sculptor, [[ilustrado]], propagandist, political activist and revolutionary hero [[Juan Luna]] (1857–1899) painted women in a different light. In his painting known as ''[[España y Filipinas]]'' ("Spain and the Philippines", 1886), Luna used symbolism and allegory by rendering a taller and strong-shouldered maternal Spaniard woman (representing [[Spain]] and [[colonialism]]) guiding a shorter, graceful and "humbly dressed" Filipino woman (representing the [[Philippines]]) towards the way to [[Social progress|progress]].&lt;ref name=Inq&gt;Ocampo, Ambeth.

Prolific in his career as a painter, Luna produced scenes that depict Philippine and European life. Luna's portrayal of [[Women in Europe|European women]] can be seen in his ''[[Las Damas Romanas]]'' ([[Women in Ancient Rome|Roman Women]], 1882), the ''[[Odalisque (painting)|Odalisque]]'' (1885), ''[[La Madrileña (En el Balcon)|La Madrileña]]'' (The Woman from Madrid, c. 1880s), ''En el Balcon'' (At the Balcony, 1884), ''Picnic in Normany'' (c. 1880s), ''The Parisian Life'' (1892), ''Despues del Baile'' (After the Dance, c. 1880s), ''Street Flower Vendor'' (c. 1880s), ''[[Ensueños de Amor]]'' (Dreams of Love, c. 1890s), ''Mi Novia'' (My Girlfriend) and ''La Marquesa de Monte Bolivar'' (The [[Marchioness]] of Monte Olivar, 1881). Luna's depiction of Filipino women can be viewed in ''[[Tampuhan]]'' (1895), ''[[La Bulaqueña]]'' (The Woman from [[Bulacan]], 1895), ''Nena y Tinita'' (Nena and Tinita, c. 1880s). Luna also painted a scene depicting [[Women in Egypt|Egyptian women]] in his ''[[The Death of Cleopatra|La Muerte de Cleopatra]]'' (The Death of [[Cleopatra]], 1881).

===Hidalgo's women===
[[File:A lady in the moonlight Félix Resurrección Hidalgo.jpg|thumb|left|120px|''A Lady in the Moonlight'' (undated) by [[Félix Resurrección Hidalgo]]]]
[[Félix Resurrección Hidalgo]] (1855-1913), one of the great Filipino painters of the late 19th century, has his fair share of artistic contribution in painting historical  female characters through the visual arts during his time. Hidalgo's ''[[Las Virgenes Cristianas Expuestas al Populacho]]'' (Christian Virgins Exposed to the Mob, 1884) recounting the suffering that women has experienced during the period in [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman history]] when the [[Persecution of Christians|persecution]] of [[Christian]]s in [[Ancient Rome]] occurred.&lt;ref name=Interior&gt;Ocampo, Ambeth R. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2479&amp;dat=20000315&amp;id=61U1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aiUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1463,36865526 Las virgenes Cristianas expuestas al populacho, Jovenes Cristianas Expuestas al Populacho, Christian Maidens Exposed to the Populace)], Looking Back, Philippine Daily Inquirer, page 9, March 15, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Presented in the masterpiece were two almost nude female slaves (symbolizing Filipino women),&lt;ref name=Clarissa/&gt; helpless and stripped of dignity, being auctioned to boorish and sexually-hungry Roman male onlookers.&lt;ref name=Clarissa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ocampo3&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2479&amp;dat=20010214&amp;id=G342AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hCUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1420,21237078 Las Virgenes Cristianas Expuestas al Populacho by Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo], Appreciating Luna and Hidalgo, Looking Back, Philippine Daily Inquirer, page 9, February 14, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Hidalgo also has a painting of a caucasian woman titled ''A lady in the Moonlight'' (undated).

===Other painters===
[[Fabián de la Rosa]], the mentor and uncle of Fernando Amorsolo and his brother [[Pablo Amorsolo]] (1898–1945) had his own technique of painting women. De la Rosa painted a group of ''Women Working in a Rice Field'' in 1902 and his portrait of a ''Young Filipina'' in 1928. Pablo Amorsolo himself painted his own rendition of a female ''Fruit Vendor'' (undated).

==Women in sculptures==

===Rizal's women===
[[File:Rizal's sculpture The Power of Science over Death.jpg|thumb|right|''The Triumph of Science over Death'' (1890) by [[José Rizal]]]]
Painter, sculptor, writer, revolutionary and Philippine national hero [[José Rizal]] (1861-1896) also used the theme of a woman of power in his sculptures. His clay sculpture known as ''[[The Triumph of Science over Death]]'' (also known as ''Scientia'', 1890) was a rendering of a naked and young woman with overflowing hair standing and trampling a skull while bearing a torch held high. The sculpture symbolized the ignorance of humankind durings the Dark Ages. The torch being held by the woman signified the victory and enlightenment that humankind has received by vanquishing death through science.&lt;ref name=Reyes&gt;{{cite book|last=Reyes|first=Raquel A. G.|title=Love, Passion and Patriotism: Sexuality and the Philippine Propaganda Movement, 1882 - 1892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W3tjWD-ngC4C&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=triumph+of+science+over+death+jose+rizal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xYrJSx2Vpd&amp;sig=h12nlAc5UKT8qE1HoNgG5GGE-Lc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nT2SUsCBMKTksASay4H4BQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=triumph%20of%20science%20over%20death%20jose%20rizal&amp;f=false|publisher=NUS Press, National University of Singapore (2008)|accessdate=24 November 2013}}, pp. 181-183 and 191.&lt;/ref&gt; In another sculpture known as the ''Victory of Death over Life'' (1890), Rizal portrayed a woman that was limp and lifeless against the hold and embrace of a cloaked figure of a standing skeleton (the symbol of death).&lt;ref name=Reyes/&gt; Rizal also sculpted another figure of a woman known as the ''Reclining Nude'' (1890). Rizal's technique of molding women into sculptures involved the rendering of the young female body as a representation of vitality and virtue. Rizal's "sculptured women", as described by Raquel A. G. Reyes in her book ''Love, Passion and Patriotism: Sexuality and the Philippine Propaganda Movement, 1882 - 1892'' were smooth, young, with unblemished condition, with traditional signs of long abundant and flowing hair on the head, with rounded conical breasts, and with absence of [[pubic hair]] on the genital area.&lt;ref name=Reyes/&gt; This overall softness and fluidity were a contrasting effect against the hardness of the ''escayola'' material used by Rizal in sculpting these women.&lt;ref name=Reyes/&gt; Rizal had drawn a sketch, using crayons, of his former girlfriend [[Leonor Rivera]].

==Women and sexuality in Philippine art==
As one example of women in Philippine art, Rizal's three sculptures (as discussed above) were described by Raquel A. G.  Reyes as a "rare representation of the insatiable female [[Sexuality in the Philippines|sexuality]] that Rizal (...) attributed to the non-Filipino woman". Reyes further explained that Rizal did not want women in the Philippines to "imitate or to emulate" the foreign women, such as the [[Women in Europe|European women]] of his time, who were the basis of his sculptures.&lt;ref name=Reyes/&gt;
