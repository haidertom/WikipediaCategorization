      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17150">'''Bacterial conjugation''' is the transfer of genetic material between [[Bacteria|bacterial cells]] by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells.&lt;ref name=Baron&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Holmes RK, Jobling MG | title = Genetics: Conjugation. ''in:'' Baron's Medical Microbiology| editor = Baron S| display-editors = etal| edition = 4th | publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996 | url =5196190145103398 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This takes place through [[pilus]] (Pili in plural).&lt;ref name=Shreyas&gt;{{cite book|author = Dr.T.S.Ramarao M.sc, Ph.D  |title = B.sc Botany-Volume-1|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a mechanism of [[horizontal gene transfer]] as are [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] and [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]] although these two other mechanisms do not involve cell-to-cell contact.&lt;ref name="Griffiths_1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Griffiths AJF |title=An Introduction to genetic analysis | edition = 7th | publisher=W.H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=0-7167-3520-2 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=Bacterial+conjugation&amp;rid=iga.section.1304|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacterial conjugation is often regarded as the bacterial equivalent of [[sexual reproduction]] or [[mating]] since it involves the exchange of genetic material. However, it 
is not sexual reproduction, since no exchange of gamete occurs, and indeed no [[biogenesis|generation of a new organism]] : instead an existing organism is [[Mutationism|transformed]]. During conjugation the ''donor'' cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a [[plasmid]] or [[transposon]].&lt;ref name=Sherris&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Ryan KJ, Ray CG | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | pages = 60–4 | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the ''recipient'' cell does not already contain a similar element.

The genetic information transferred is often beneficial to the recipient. Benefits may include [[antibiotic resistance]], [[xenobiotic]] tolerance or the ability to use new [[metabolites]].&lt;ref name=Baron2&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Holmes RK, Jobling MG | title = Genetics: Exchange of Genetic Information. ''in:'' Baron's Medical Microbiology| editor = Baron S| display-editors = etal| edition = 4th | publisher = Univ of Texas Medical Branch | year = 1996 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?highlight=conjugation&amp;rid=mmed.section.468 | isbn = 0-9631172-1-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such beneficial plasmids may be considered bacterial [[endosymbionts]]. Other elements, however, may be viewed as bacterial [[parasitism|parasites]] and conjugation as a mechanism evolved by them to allow for their spread.

==History==
The process was discovered in 1946 by [[Joshua Lederberg]] and [[Edward Tatum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lederberg J, Tatum EL | title = Gene recombination in ''E. coli'' | journal = Nature | year = 1946 | volume = 158 | pages = 558 | url = | doi = 10.1038/158558a0 | issue = 4016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism ==
[[File:Conjugation.svg|right|thumb|350px|Schematic drawing of bacterial conjugation.]]

'''Conjugation diagram'''

#Donor cell produces [[pilus]].
#Pilus attaches to recipient cell and brings the two cells together.
#The mobile plasmid is nicked and a single strand of DNA is then transferred to the recipient cell.
#Both cells synthesize a complementary strand to produce a double stranded circular plasmid and also reproduce pili; both cells are now viable donor for the F-factor.&lt;ref name=Baron /&gt;

The F-plasmid is an [[episome]] (a plasmid that can integrate itself into the bacterial [[chromosome]] by [[Homologous recombination#In bacteria|homologous recombination]]) with a length of about 100 [[kilo-base pair|kb]]. It carries its own [[origin of replication]], the ''oriV'', and an origin of transfer, or ''oriT''.&lt;ref name=Sherris /&gt; There can only be one copy of the F-plasmid in a given bacterium, either free or integrated, and bacteria that possess a copy are called ''F-positive'' or ''F-plus'' (denoted F&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Cells that lack F plasmids are called ''F-negative'' or ''F-minus'' (F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and as such can function as recipient cells.

Among other genetic information, the F-plasmid carries a ''tra'' and ''trb'' [[locus (genetics)|locus]], which together are about 33 kb long and consist of about 40 [[gene]]s. The ''tra'' locus includes the ''pilin'' gene and regulatory genes, which together form [[pilus|pili]] on the cell surface. The locus also includes the genes for the [[protein]]s that attach themselves to the surface of F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; bacteria and initiate conjugation. Though there is some debate on the exact mechanism of conjugation it seems that the pili are not the structures through which DNA exchange occurs. This has been shown in experiments where the pilus are allowed to make contact, but then are denatured with SDS and yet DNA transformation still proceeds. Several proteins coded for in the ''tra'' or ''trb'' locus seem to open a channel between the bacteria and it is thought that the traD enzyme, located at the base of the pilus, initiates membrane fusion.

When conjugation is initiated by a signal the '''[[relaxase]]''' [[enzyme]] creates a [[nick (DNA)|nick]] in one of the strands of the conjugative plasmid at the ''oriT''. Relaxase may work alone or in a complex of over a dozen proteins known collectively as a '''[[relaxosome]]'''. In the F-plasmid system the relaxase enzyme is called TraI and the relaxosome consists of TraI, TraY, TraM and the integrated host factor IHF. The nicked strand, or ''T-strand'', is then unwound from the unbroken strand and transferred to the recipient cell in a 5'-terminus to 3'-terminus direction. The remaining strand is replicated either independent of conjugative action (vegetative replication beginning at the ''oriV'') or in concert with conjugation (conjugative replication similar to the [[rolling circle]] replication of [[lambda phage]]). Conjugative replication may require a second nick before successful transfer can occur. A recent report claims to have inhibited conjugation with chemicals that mimic an intermediate step of this second nicking event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lujan SA, Guogas LM, Ragonese H, Matson SW, Redinbo MR | title = Disrupting antibiotic resistance propagation by inhibiting the conjugative DNA relaxase | journal = PNAS | year = 2007 | volume = 104 | pages = 12282–7 |pmc=1916486 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0702760104 | jstor=25436291 | issue = 30 | pmid=17630285}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hfr Recombination.png|thumb|1.The [[insertion sequence]]s (yellow) on both the [[Fertility factor (bacteria)|F factor]] plasmid and the chromosome have similar sequences, allowing the F factor to insert itself into the [[genome]] of the cell. This is called [[homologous recombination]] and creates an Hfr (high frequency of recombination) cell.

2.The Hfr cell forms a pilus and attaches to a recipient F- cell.

3.A nick in one strand of the Hfr cell's chromosome is created.

4.DNA begins to be transferred from the Hfr cell to the recipient cell while the second strand of its chromosome is being replicated.

5.The pilus detaches from the recipient cell and retracts. The Hfr cell ideally wants to transfer its entire genome to the recipient cell. However, due to its large size and inability to keep in contact with the recipient cell, it is not able to do so.

6.a. The F- cell remains F- because the entire F factor sequence was not received. Since no homologous recombination occurred, the DNA that was transferred is degraded by enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.microbiologybook.org/mayer/genetic%20ex.htm|title=Genetic Exchange|website=www.microbiologybook.org|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

    b. In very rare cases, the F factor will be completely transferred and the F- cell will become an Hfr cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griffiths|first=Anthony JF|last2=Miller|first2=Jeffrey H.|last3=Suzuki|first3=David T.|last4=Lewontin|first4=Richard C.|last5=Gelbart|first5=William M.|date=2000|title=Bacterial conjugation|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21942/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
]]
If the F-plasmid that is transferred has previously been integrated into the donor's genome (producing an Hfr strain ["High Frequency of Recombination"]) some of the donor's chromosomal DNA may also be transferred with the plasmid DNA.&lt;ref name=Griffiths_1999 /&gt; The amount of chromosomal DNA that is transferred depends on how long the two conjugating bacteria remain in contact. In common laboratory strains of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' the transfer of the entire bacterial chromosome takes about 100 minutes. The transferred DNA can then be integrated into the recipient genome via [[homologous recombination]].

A cell culture that contains in its population cells with non-integrated F-plasmids usually also contains a few cells that have accidentally integrated their plasmids. It is these cells that are responsible for the low-frequency chromosomal gene transfers that occur in such cultures. Some strains of bacteria with an integrated F-plasmid can be isolated and grown in pure culture. Because such strains transfer chromosomal genes very efficiently they are called '''[[Hfr cell|Hfr]]''' ('''h'''igh '''f'''requency of '''r'''ecombination). The ''E. coli'' [[genome]] was originally mapped by interrupted mating experiments in which various Hfr cells in the process of conjugation were sheared from recipients after less than 100 minutes (initially using a Waring blender). The genes that were transferred were then investigated.

Since integration of the F-plasmid into the ''E. coli'' chromosome is a rare spontaneous occurrence, and since the numerous genes promoting DNA transfer are in the plasmid genome rather than in the bacterial genome, it has been argued that conjugative bacterial gene transfer, as it occurs in the E. coli Hfr system, is not an evolutionary adaptation of the bacterial host, nor is it likely ancestral to eukaryotic sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michod RE, Bernstein H, Nedelcu AM | year = 2008 | title = Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens | url = http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf | journal = Infect Genet Evol | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 267–285 | doi = 10.1016/j.meegid.2008.01.002 | pmid = 18295550 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conjugal transfer in mycobacteria==
Conjugation in ''Mycobacteria smegmatis'', like conjugation in ''E. coli'', requires stable and extended contact between a donor and a recipient strain, is DNase resistant, and the transferred DNA is incorporated into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination. However, unlike ''E. coli'' Hfr conjugation, mycobacterial conjugation is chromosome rather than plasmid based.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gray TA, Krywy JA, Harold J, Palumbo MJ, Derbyshire KM |title=Distributive conjugal transfer in mycobacteria generates progeny with meiotic-like genome-wide mosaicism, allowing mapping of a mating identity locus |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=11 |issue=7 |pages=e1001602 |year=2013 |pmid=23874149 |pmc=3706393 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001602 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Derby&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Derbyshire KM, Gray TA |title=Distributive Conjugal Transfer: New Insights into Horizontal Gene Transfer and Genetic Exchange in Mycobacteria |journal=Microbiol Spectr |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages= 61–79|year=2014 |pmid=25505644 |pmc=4259119 |doi=10.1128/microbiolspec.MGM2-0022-2013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in contrast to ''E. coli'' Hfr conjugation, in ''M. smegmatis'' all regions of the chromosome are transferred with comparable efficiencies. The lengths of the donor segments vary widely, but have an average length of 44.2kb. Since a mean of 13 tracts are transferred, the average total of transferred DNA per genome is 575kb.&lt;ref name=Derby /&gt; This process is referred to as "Distributive conjugal transfer."&lt;ref name=Gray /&gt;&lt;ref name=Derby /&gt; Gray et al.&lt;ref name=Gray /&gt; found substantial blending of the parental genomes as a result of conjugation and regarded this blending as reminiscent of that seen in the meiotic products of sexual reproduction.

==Inter-kingdom transfer==
[[File:Agrobacteriumgall.jpg|thumb|''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'' gall at the root of ''Carya illinoensis''.]]
Bacteria related to the [[diazotroph|nitrogen fixing]] ''[[Rhizobia]]'' are an interesting case of inter-[[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] conjugation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pan SQ, Jin S, Boulton MI, Hawes M, Gordon MP, Nester EW |title=An Agrobacterium virulence factor encoded by a Ti plasmid gene or a chromosomal gene is required for T-DNA transfer into plants |journal=Mol. Microbiol. |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=259–69 |date=July 1995 |pmid=7494475 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.1995.mmi_17020259.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid of ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' and the root-tumor inducing (Ri) plasmid of ''A. rhizogenes'' contain genes that are capable of transferring to plant cells. The expression of these genes effectively transforms the plant cells into [[opines|opine]]-producing factories. Opines are used by the bacteria as sources of nitrogen and energy. Infected cells form [[Agrobacterium tumefaciens|crown gall]] or [[Agrobacterium rhizogenes|root tumors]]. The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus [[endosymbiont]]s of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant.

The Ti and Ri plasmids can also be transferred between bacteria using a system (the ''tra'', or [[Transfer gene|transfer, operon]]) that is different and independent of the system used for inter-kingdom transfer (the ''vir'', or [[virulence]], operon). Such transfers create virulent strains from previously avirulent strains.

== Genetic engineering applications ==
Conjugation is a convenient means for [[genetic engineering|transferring genetic material]] to a variety of targets. In laboratories, successful transfers have been reported from bacteria to yeast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heinemann JA, Sprague GF |title=Bacterial conjugative plasmids mobilize DNA transfer between bacteria and yeast |journal=Nature |volume=340 |issue=6230 |pages=205–9 |date=July 1989 |pmid=2666856 |doi=10.1038/340205a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; plants, mammalian cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kunik T, Tzfira T, Kapulnik Y, Gafni Y, Dingwall C, Citovsky V |title=Genetic transformation of HeLa cells by Agrobacterium |journal=Proc.

In plant engineering, ''Agrobacterium''-like conjugation complements other standard vehicles such as [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV). While TMV is capable of infecting many plant families these are primarily [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] [[dicot]]s. ''Agrobacterium''-like conjugation is also primarily used for dicots, but [[monocot]] recipients are not uncommon.

''' Bilingual interactive activation plus''' ('''BIA+''') is a model for understanding the process of [[bilingual]] language comprehension and consists of two interactive subsystems: the word identification subsystem and task/decision subsystem.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;van Heuven, W.J.B., Dijkstra, T., 2010. Language comprehension in the bilingual brain: fMRI and ERP support for psycholinguistic models. Brain Research Reviews 64, 104–122&lt;/ref&gt; It is the successor of the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA) model &lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, T., Van Heuven, W.J.B., &amp; Grainger, J. (1998). Simulating cross-language competition with the bilingual interactive activation model. Psychologica Belgica, 38, 177–196.&lt;/ref&gt; which was updated in 2002 to include [[phonologic]] and [[semantic]] [[lexicon|lexical]] representations, revise the role of language nodes, and specify the purely bottom-up nature of bilingual language processing.

== Overview ==
The BIA+ is one of many models that was defined based on data from [[psycholinguistic]] or [[behavioral]] studies which investigate how the languages of bilinguals are manipulated during listening, reading and speaking each of them; however, BIA+ is now being supported by [[neuroimaging]] data linking this model to more neurally inspired ones which have a greater focus on the brain areas and mechanisms involved in these tasks.

The two basic tools in these studies are the [[event-related potential]] (ERP) which has high [[temporal resolution]] but low [[spatial resolution]] and the [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) which typically has high spatial resolution and low temporal resolution. When used together, however, these two methods can generate a more complete picture of the time course and interactivity of bilingual language processing according to the BIA+ model.&lt;ref name=review/&gt; These methods, however, do need to be considered carefully as overlapping activation areas in the brain do not imply that there is no functional separation between the two languages at the neuronal or higher-order level.&lt;ref name="hernandez2005 "&gt;Hernandez, A., Li, P., MacWhinney, B., 2005. The emergence of competing module in bilingualism. Trends in Cognitive Sciences 9, 220–225&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distinction of 2 subsystems: word identification vs. task/decision ===
	According to the BIA+ model shown in the figure, during word identification, the visual input activates the sublexical [[orthography|orthographic]] representations which simultaneously activate both the orthographic whole-word lexical and the sublexical [[phonological]] representations. Both whole-word orthographic and phonological representations then activate the semantic representations and language nodes which indicate membership to a particular language. All of this information is then used in the task/decision subsystem to carry out the remainder of the task at hand. The two subsystems are further described by the assumptions associated with them below.

==== ''Word identification subsystem'' ====

===== ''Integrated lexicon'' =====
	The integrated lexicon assumption describes the interactivity of the visual representation of word or word parts and [[orthography]], the [[phonologic]] or auditory component of language processing, and the [[semantic]] or significance and meaning representations of words.&lt;ref name="briellmann"&gt;Briellmann, R.S., Saling, M.M., Connell, A.B., Waites, A.B., Abbott, D.F., Jackson G.D., 2004. A high-field functional MRI study of the quadric-lingual subjects. Brain Land. 89, 531–542&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was tested with orthographic neighbors, words of the same length that differ by one letter only (e.g. BALL and FALL). The number of target and non-target language neighbors influenced target word processing in both the primary language (L1) and the secondary language (L2).&lt;ref&gt;van Heuven, W.J.B., Dijkstra, T., Grainger, J., 1998. Orthographic neighborhood effects in bilingual word recognition. Journal of Memory and Language 39, 458–483&lt;/ref&gt; This cross-language neighborhood effect was supposed to reflect a co-activation of words whatever the language they belong to, that is a lexical access that is language nonselective. Both target and nontarget languages can be automatically and unconsciously activated even in a pure monolingual mode. This does not imply, however, that there may not be features unique to one language (i.e. the use of different alphabets) or that, at the semantic level, there are no shared features.

===== ''Language nodes/tags'' =====
	This assumption states that language nodes/tags exist to provide a representation for the language of membership based on the information from upstream orthographic and phonological word ID processes. According to the BIA+ model, these tags have no effect on the activation level representation of words.&lt;ref name=review/&gt; The focus of activation of these nodes is postlexical: the existence of these nodes enables bilingual individuals not to get too much interference from the nontarget language while they process one of their language.

===== ''Nonselective/Parallel access'' =====
	Parallel access assumes that language is nonselective and that both potential word choices are activated in the bilingual brain when exposed to the same stimulus. For example, test subjects reading in their second language have been found to [[unconsciously]] translate to their primary language.&lt;ref name="Thierry2007"&gt;Thierry, G., Wu, Y.J., 2007. Brain potential reveal unconscious translation during foreign-language comprehension. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. U.S.A. 104, 12530-12535&lt;/ref&gt; [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] stimulus response activation measurements show that semantic [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] effects were seen in both languages and an individual cannot consciously focus their attention to only one language, even when told to ignore the second.&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;Martin, C.D., Dering, B., Thomas, E.M., Thierry, G., 2009. Brain potentials reveal semantic priming in both the 'active' and the 'non-attended' language in early bilinguals. NeuroImage 47, 326–333&lt;/ref&gt;
This language nonselective lexical access has been shown during semantic activation across languages, but also at the orthographic and phonological levels.

===== ''Temporal delay of L2'' =====
	The temporal delay assumption is based on the principle of [[resting potential]] activation which reflects the frequency of word use by the bilingual such that high frequency words correlate to high resting level activation potentials, and words used with little frequency correlate to low resting level activation potentials. A high resting potential is one that is less negative or closer to zero, the point of activation, and therefore needs less stimuli in order to become activated. Because the less commonly used words of L2 have a lower resting level activation, L1 is likely to be activated before L2 as seen by N400 ERP patterns.&lt;ref name="moreno2005"&gt;Moreno, E.M., Kutas, M., 2009. Processing semantic anomalie in two languages: an electrophysiological exploration in both language of Spanish-English bilinguals. Cognitive Brain Research 22, 205–220&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
	This resting level activation of words also reflects the proficiency level of bilinguals and their frequency of usage of the two languages. When a bilingual’s [[language proficiency]] is lower in L2 than L1, the activation of L2 lexical representations will be further delayed as more extensive or higher-level brain activation is necessary for language control.&lt;ref name=briellmann/&gt; Both low and high proficiency bilinguals have parallel activation of the word representations, however the less proficient language, L2, becomes active more slowly contributing to the temporal delay assumption.

===== Word identification localization in the brain =====
	The locations of many of the word identification processing tasks have been determined with fMRI studies. Word retrieval is localized in [[Broca's area]] of the [[prefrontal cortex]],&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;Thompson-Schill, S.L., D'Esposito, M., Aguirre, G.K., Farah, M.J., 1997. Role of the left inferior parietal cortex in retrieval of semantic knowledge: a reevaluation. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America  94, 14792-14797&lt;/ref&gt; whereas storage of information is localized in the inferior [[temporal lobes]].
Globally, the same brain areas have been shown to be activated across the L1 and L2 in highly proficient bilinguals. Some subtle differences between L1 and L2 activations emerge though when testing lower proficient bilinguals.

==== ''Task/decision subsystem'' ====
	The task/decision subsystem of the BIA+ model determines which actions must be executed for the task at hand based on the relevant information that becomes available after word identification processing.&lt;ref name=review/&gt; This subsystem involves many of the executive processes including monitoring and control associated with the [[prefrontal cortex]].

===== ''Bottom-up control of task/decision from word identification'' =====
	Action plans that meet the task at hand are executed by the task/decision system on the basis of activation information from the word identification subsystem.&lt;ref name=martin/&gt; Studies that tested bilinguals with [[homographs]] showed that conflicts between target and non-target language readings of the homographs still led to a difference in activation between it and a control, implying that bilinguals are not able to regulate activation in the word identification system.&lt;ref name="vanHeuven2008"&gt;van Heuven, W.J.B., Schriefers, H., Dijkstra, T. Hagoort, P., 2008. Language conflicts in the bilingual brain. Cerebral Cortex 18, 458–483&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the action plans of the task/decision system have no direct influence on activations of word identification language subsystem.

===== Task/decision localization in the brain =====
	The neural correlates of the task/ decision subsystem consist of multiple components that map onto different areas of prefrontal cortex responsible for executing control functions. For example, the general executive functions of language switching have been found to activate the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] areas.,&lt;ref name="hernandez2009"&gt;Hernandez, A.E. 2009. Language switching in the bilingual brain: what’s next?. Brain and Language 109, 133–140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="price1999"&gt;Price, C.J., Green, D.W., von Studnitz, R.1999. A functional imaging study of translation and language switching. Brain 122, 2221–2235&lt;/ref&gt;
	
	Translation, on the other hand, requires controlled actions in language representations and has been associated with the left [[basal ganglia]],&lt;ref name=price1999/&gt;&lt;ref name="lehtonen"&gt;Lehtonen, M.H., Laine, M., Niemi, J., Thomsen, T., Vorobyev, V.A., Hugdhal, K., 2005. Brain correlates of sentence translation in Finnish-Norwegian bilinguals. NeuroReport 16, 607–610&lt;/ref&gt; The left [[caudate nucleus]] has been associated with control of in-use language,&lt;ref&gt;Crinion, J., Turner, R., Grogan, A., Hanakawa, T., Noppeney, U., Devlin, J.T., et al, 2006. Language control in the bilingual brain. Science 312, 1537–1540&lt;/ref&gt; and the left mid-[[prefrontal cortex]] is responsible for monitoring interference and suppressing competing responses between languages.,&lt;ref name=lehtonen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodriquez-Fornells, A., van der Lugt, A., Rotte, M., Britti, B., Heinze, H.J., Munte, T.F., 2005. Second language interferes with word production in fluent bilinguals: brain potential and functional imaging evidence. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 17, 422–433&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
	According to the BIA+ model, when a bilingual with English as their primary language and Spanish as their secondary language translates the word ''advertencia'' from Spanish to English, several steps occur. The bilingual would use the orthographic and phonological cues to differentiate this word from the similar English word ''advertisement''. At this point, however, the bilingual automatically derives the semantic meaning of the word, not only for the correct Spanish meaning of advertencia which is ''warning'' but also for the Spanish meaning of advertisement which is ''publicidad''.

	This information would then be stored in the bilingual’s [[working memory]] and used in the task/decision system to determine which of the two translations best fits the task at hand. Since the original instructions were to translate from Spanish to English, the bilingual would choose the correct translation of ''advertencia'' to be ''warning'' and not ''advertisement''.

== Differences between BIA+ and BIA precursor ==
	While the BIA+ models shares several similarities with its predecessor, the BIA model, there are a few distinct differences that exist between the two. First and most notable is the purely bottom-up nature of the BIA+ model which assumes that information from the task/decision subsystem cannot influence the word identification subsystem, while the BIA model assumes that the two systems can fully interact.

	Second is that the language membership nodes of the BIA+ model do not affect the activation levels of the word identification system, whereas they play an [[inhibitory]] role in the BIA model. 	

	Finally participant expectations could potentially affect the task/decision system in the BIA+ model; however the BIA model assumes there is no strong effect on the activation state of words based on expectations.&lt;ref name=review/&gt;

== Future ==
The BIA+ model has been supported by many of the quantitative [[neuroimaging]] studies but more research needs to be completed in order to strengthen the model as a frontrunner in the accepted models for bilingual language processing. In the task/decision system, the task components are well-defined (e.g. translation, language switching) but the decision components involved in the execution of these tasks in the subsystem are underspecified. The relationship of the components in this subsystem need further exploration in order to be fully understood.

Scientists are also considering the use of [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG) in future studies. This technology would link the spatial activation processes with the temporal patterns of brain response more accurately than simultaneously considering the response data from ERP and fMRI which are more limited.

Not only have studies suggested that the executive functioning of bilingualism extends beyond the language system, but bilinguals have also been shown to be faster processors who display fewer conflict effects than monolinguals in attentional tasks&lt;ref&gt;Costa, A., Hernandez, M., Sebastian-Galles, N., 2008. Bilingualism aids conflict resolution: evidence from the ANT task. Cognition 106, 59–86&lt;/ref&gt; This research implies that there may be some spillover effects of learning a second language on other areas of cognitive function that could be explored.

One future direction theories on [[bilingual word recognition]] should take is the investigation of developmental aspects of [[bilingual lexical access]].&lt;ref&gt;Grainger, J., Midgley, K., &amp; Holcomb, P.J. (2010). Re-thinking the bilingual interactive-activation model from a developmental perspective (BIA-d). In M. Kail &amp; M. Hickmann (Eds.), Language Acquisition across Linguistic and Cognitive Systems. New York: John Benjamins (pp. 267–284).&lt;/ref&gt; Most studies have investigated highly proficient bilinguals, but not many have looked at low-proficient bilinguals or even L2 learners. This new direction should prove to bring a lot of educational applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15957">'''Biological systems engineering''' or '''biosystems engineering''' is a broad-based [[engineering]] discipline with particular emphasis on [[biology]] and [[chemistry]]. It can be thought of as a subset of the broader notion of [[biological engineering]] or bio-technology though not in the respects that pertain to [[biomedical engineering]] as ''biosystems'' engineering tends to focus less on medical applications than on ''agriculture, ecosystems, and food science''. It involves aspects of [[genetic engineering]], particularly regarding the agricultural applications. The discipline focuses broadly on environmentally sound and sustainable engineering solutions to meet societies' ecologically-related needs. Biosystems engineering integrates the expertise of fundamental engineering fields with expertise from non-engineering disciplines.

==Background and organization==
Many college and university [[biological engineering]] departments have a history of being grounded in [[agricultural engineering]] and have only in the past two decades or so changed their names to reflect the movement towards more diverse biological based engineering programs.&lt;ref&gt;For example the [http://www.bse.vt.edu/department/ Department of Biological Systems Engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040401231525/http://www.bse.vt.edu/department/ |date=2004-04-01 }} at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University was established as agricultural engineering in 1920, and renamed in 1992 to reflect new focus areas in the teaching, research and extension programs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Department of Biological Systems Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln began within Mechanical Engineering, awarded its first degree in Agricultural Engineering in 1908, and changed its name to Biological Systems Engineering in 1990.  http://engineering.unl.edu/bse/history/&lt;/ref&gt;  This major is sometimes called agricultural and biological engineering, biological and environmental engineering, etc., in different universities, generally reflecting interests of local employment opportunities.

Since biological engineering covers a wide spectrum, many departments now offer specialization options. Depending on the department and the specialization options offered within each program, curricula may overlap with other related fields. There are a number of different titles for BSE-related departments at various universities.  The professional societies commonly associated with many Biological Engineering programs include the [[American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers]] (ASABE)&lt;ref&gt;Website [http://www.asabe.org/ American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers]&lt;/ref&gt; and the  [[Institute of Biological Engineering]] (IBE),&lt;ref&gt;Website [http://www.ibe.org/ Institute of Biological Engineers]&lt;/ref&gt; which generally encompasses BSE.  Some program also participate in the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) &lt;ref&gt;Website [http://bmes.org/ Biomedical Engineering Society],&lt;/ref&gt; and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).&lt;ref&gt;Website [http://www.aiche.org/ American Institute of Chemical Engineers],&lt;/ref&gt;

A biological systems engineer has a background in what both environmental engineers and biologists do, thus bridging the gap between engineering and the (non-medical) biological sciences – although this is variable across academic institutions. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}  For this reason, biological systems engineers are becoming integral parts of many environmental engineering firms, federal agencies, and [[biotechnology]] industries.  A biological systems engineer will often address the solution to a problem from the perspective of employing living systems to enact change.  For example, biological treatment methodologies can be applied to provide access to clean drinking water &lt;ref&gt;Website http://www.jbioleng.org/content/5/1/2/ Biological approaches for addressing the grand challenge of providing access to clean drinking water&lt;/ref&gt; or for sequestration of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;Website http://www.jbioleng.org/content/5/1/14/ Addressing the Grand Challenge of atmospheric carbon dioxide: geologic sequestration vs. biological recycling&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BlackSun.svg|thumb|The "Black Sun" symbol from Wewelsburg castle]]
The '''black sun''' (German {{lang|de|Schwarze Sonne}}) is a symbol employed by the [[SS]] during the [[Nazi era]], and in a post-[[Third Reich]] context by [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] and some [[occult]] subcultures, such as [[Satanism]]. The first known occurrence of the symbol is on a green and white mosaic on a floor in [[Wewelsburg]], a castle near [[Paderborn]], [[Germany]] remodeled and expanded under [[Heinrich Himmler]]. The symbol's design consists of twelve radial [[Sowilō#Armanen_runes|sig runes]], symbols employed as a logo by the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]''. All subsequent forms extend from this mosaic. Whether the symbol had a name or held any particular significance among the SS remains unknown. Its association with the occult concept of the "black sun" (and therefore also its name) developed from the influence of a popular German novel first published in 1991.

==Wewelsburg mosaic==
[[File:Schwarze_Sonne_Obergruppenführersaal_(SS_Generals%27_Hall).jpg|thumb|The former SS Generals' Hall (German: ''Obergruppenführersaal'') on the first floor of the North Tower of Wewelsburg Castle with the dark green sun wheel mosaic located on the floor in the center of the hall]]
In 1933, [[Heinrich Himmler]] acquired [[Wewelsburg]], a castle near [[Paderborn]], [[Germany]]. Himmler intended to make the structure into a center for the SS, and between 1936 and 1942, Himmler ordered the building expanded and rebuilt for ceremonial purposes.&lt;ref name="GOODRICK-CLARKE-148-150"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke (2003: 148-150).&lt;/ref&gt;

A product of Himmler's remodeling, the symbol widely known today as the "Black Sun" consists of twelve circular sig runes on the floor of the structure's north tower (the ''Obergruppenführersaal''). The intended significance of the image remains unknown, but the artist may have found inspiration from decorative [[Merovingian]] discs dating from the early medieval period (see ''[[Zierscheibe]]''). The objects received notable discourse during the Nazi era.&lt;ref name="GOODRICK-CLARKE-148-150"/&gt;

In 1991, writer [[Russell McCloud]] published the popular novel ''Die Schwarze Sonne von Tashi Lhunpo'' (German 'The Black Sun of Tashi Lhunpo') which scholar [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] describes as an "occult-Nazi thriller". In the novel, McCloud links the Wewelsburg mosaic with the occult concept of the black sun, which had been introduced in the 1950s by the [[Landig Group]] as a replacement for the [[swastika]] and as a symbol for a mystic energy source that was supposed to renew the [[Aryan]] race. After the publication of the novel, the Wewelsburg symbol became popularly known as the "Black Sun".&lt;ref name="GOODRICK-CLARKE-148-150"/&gt;

==Neo-Nazism, white nationalism, and the alt-right==
The symbol has historically remained prominent in neo-Nazi occult circles, wherein it occurs frequently in print publications and on associated websites.&lt;ref name="GOODRICK-CLARKE-148-150"/&gt; However, the symbol also sees frequent use in many [[neo-Nazi]], [[alt-right]], and [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] more generally, as seen, for example, on imagery used by [[Vanguard America]] during the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] in August 2017.&lt;ref name="PORTER-2017"&gt;Porter (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Azov Battalion]], a [[National Guard of Ukraine]] regiment widely associated with neofascism, employs the symbol in an official capacity as an emblem element, along with the Wolfsangel.&lt;ref name="LUHN-2014"&gt;Luhn (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use by the Church of Satan==
Along with other symbols from the Nazi era such as the [[Wolfsangel]], the [[Sowilō#Armanen_runes|sig rune]], and the [[totenkopf]], the black sun is used by adherents of the [[Church of Satan]] and other [[Satanism|Satanists]]. According to scholar Chris Mathews:

{{quote|In defending their use, Satanists draw attention to their historical origins, as most have origins that precede their Nazi application, some stretching centuries back into the past. [Specifically], they adopt the primary iconography of the SS, the Nazi's own elite order. With these symbols, many of the pre-Nazism connections are questionable. Of the numerous permutations of the Wolfsangle, Satanists adopt the form used by the SS and numerous fascist organizations. Likewise, the Totenkopf used in the nineteenth century by the Prussian military was markedly more cartoonish than the SS's Death Head version, which is the version Church of Satan members use. The Black Sun motif is even less ambiguous. Though based on medieval German symbols, the Wewelsburg mosaic is a unique design commissioned specifically for Himmler, and its primary contemporary association is [[Nazi occultism]], for which Nazi Satanic groups and [[Esoteric Nazism|esoteric neo-Nazis]] adopt it.&lt;ref name="MATHEWS-2009-153"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mQrbsOWaOyUC&amp;q=black+sun&amp;chrome_dont_add_custom_search_engines_srsly=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mathews (2009: 153)].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mathews notes that Satanists sometimes combine Nazi imagery, such as when the Church of Satan's online store sold Wolfsangel rings by presenting them before a Black Sun background. Mathews says, "Despite the systematic exploitation of ambiguity, any denial that Nazi symbols are being used ''as'' Nazi symbols is both disingenuous and unconvincing."&lt;ref name="MATHEWS-2009-153"/&gt;

==Pop culture==
In 2018, the symbol appeared on merchandise for Colombian pop singer [[Shakira]]'s [[El Dorado World Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.dw.com/en/shakira-selling-nazi-like-trinket-for-el-dorado-tour/a-44301030 | title=Shakira selling Nazi-like trinket for El Dorado tour | date=19 June 2018 | publisher=Deutsche Welle | accessdate=5 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Live Nation Entertainment]], "The necklace Live Nation designed for Shakira’s ‘El Dorado World Tour’ was based on pre-Colombian imagery ... However, some fans have expressed concern that the design bears an unintentional resemblance to neo-Nazi imagery. We sincerely apologize for this inadvertent similarity and have permanently pulled the item from the tour collection".&lt;ref name="SHAKIRA"&gt;Park (2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10387">'''Bounded emotionality''' is a [[communications studies]] approach to dealing with [[emotional control]] in the workplace. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Emotional control simply refers to how [[Employment|employers and employees]] handle the range of emotions that naturally occur in the [[workplace]]. These emotions can occur because of work, or they can be brought into work from an employee's home life. Bounded emotionality was proposed by [[Dennis K. Mumby]] and [[Linda L. Putnam]]. Mumby and Putnam (1992) stress that bounded emotionality encourages the [[Emotional expression|expression]] of a wide range of emotions. Their theory encourages expression of emotions because it is a way to maintain [[interpersonal relationships]] and [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]] among people in the organization. Additionally, the expression of emotions strengthens work relations because people bond over mutual feelings. Bounded emotionality is a broad framework for organizations to use when dealing with emotions.  It has six defining characteristics. The characteristics are: [[intersubjective]] limitations, spontaneously emergent work feelings, tolerance of [[ambiguity]], [[heterarchy]] of values, integrated [[self identity]] and [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]], and [[Sense of community|community]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Origins ==
Prior to Mumby and Putnam's specific articulation of bounded emotionality research and the role it plays in what is known about organizational emotion regulation, workplace emotion research focused on the relationship between emotion regulation, [[work performance]] and general attitudes towards work. Traditionally, two concepts, '''[[bounded rationality]]''' and '''[[emotional labor]]''' were used to describe conventional organizational theory pertaining to emotional regulation. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Bounded Rationality:''' Whereas bounded emotionality encourages the expression of a large spectrum of emotions in organizational communication, bounded rationality advocates for the “control” or tempering of any emotion or [[Personality|personal characteristics]] that may interfere with [[rational]] organizational decision making. Simon introduced the term bounded rationality and cast it as “bounded” because he viewed highly emotion-based forms of reasoning such as [[intuition]] and [[judgement]] as [[irrational]] and thus unhelpful in reaching organizational goals. Bounded rationality approaches to emotional regulation not only devalue individual emotion in the workplace but also view excessive emotional expression as [[inappropriate]] for the work setting. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Emotional Labor:''' Emotional labor refers to the way in which individuals manage emotions based on what is perceived as “appropriate” in specific social or environmental situations. Human beings often pay close attention to their surroundings and how they should act in certain social situations. A variety of organizational factors as well as personal factors may impact emotional regulation including: [[socialization]], [[Interpersonal_communication#Situational_milieu|channels of communication]], departmental differences (e.g. sales vs. packaging), etc. In an organization that deploys a bounded emotionality approach to emotional regulation, much less emotional labor will be required than an organization that deploys a bounded rationality approach.

Mumby and Putnam introduced the concept of bounded emotionality as an alternative organizational concept to bounded rationality and emotional labor in order to demonstrate the instability of traditional understandings and highlight what they believe to be the importance of emotions in organizational decision-making. In an organization framed by bounded emotionality (as opposed to bounded rationality and emotional labor), hierarchical goals and values are flexible as emotion and the physical self are not isolated from the process of organizing. In other words, emotions are “bounded” in organizations to protect [[interpersonal relationships]] and mutual understandings, two organizational aspects that Mumby and Putnam argue as important to success. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Bounded emotionality vs. Unbounded emotionality ==

'''Unbounded Emotionality''' should be enacted not for the instrumental gain of the organization, but to enhance the well-being of the individual organizational members. [[Work stress]] is a political, organizational and community issue that can be difficult to implement in large organizations. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Bounded Emotionality''' is a limited, pragmatic approach to the problem of emotional control in organizations. It focuses on work related emotions, defined as, “feelings, sensations, and affective responses to organizational sensations”. However, it is acknowledged that such work feelings stem from and affect emotions that come from one’s [[personal life]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Encourages the expression of a wider range of emotions than is usually condoned in traditional and [[normative]] organizations

* Stresses the importance of maintaining interpersonally sensitive, variable boundaries between what is felt and what is expressed

* The goal of bounded emotionality to build interpersonal relationships through mutual understanding of work related feelings

* Six defining characteristics &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Defining characteristics ==
'''Intersubjective Limitations''': This is a necessary restriction known by individuals in the organization that helps them adequately work with and respond to one another . Just as individuals do in personal relationships, they need to respect emotional boundaries in professional ones. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: If a coworker feels certain emotional expressions or topics are inappropriate, you will not discuss them. Similarly, they will respect what you find inappropriate. Those [[personal boundaries]] are the intersubjective limitations of the work relationship.  For instance, a cabin crew member may be absolutely repulsed by vomit, but when a passenger vomits that cabin crew member controls the disgust and helps calms the passenger down. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Spontaneously emergent work feelings''': Feelings about work emerge in response to work tasks. Generally these form around the organizations [[Organisation climate|climate]] and [[workplace|environment]]. This is natural and [[management]] should not try to ascribe feelings to employees. When spontaneous feelings emerge they should be dealt with within the previously set intersubjective limitations. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: An example of this would be a study done on [[hair stylists]]. The study found that for the employee they found enjoyment when a [[customer]] confided in them about a private matter. That consumer as well would find it satisfying, therefore more likely to return. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Tolerance of [[ambiguity]]''': Complex emotions are likely to occur because of emotional labor (the process of controlling emotions during interactions at work). Bounded emotionality entails tolerance of these complex emotions. Contradictory feelings must coexist. This constitutes a new norm that wants to be aware of different positions, and even those directly opposite among its organizational members. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: People with low tolerance of ambiguity experience stress react prematurely and avoid ambiguous stimuli. The person with high tolerance will look at ambiguous situations as desirable, challenging, and interesting. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''[[Heterarchy]] of [[values]]''': The opposite of [[hierarchy]] of values, or placing certain values as more important than others. A heterarchy of values means that no one is set above another. The context of situations and individual preferences determines what values may be prioritized in a given moment. There is not just one universal set of values guiding one's life choices. Heterarchy is designed for handling the innovative side of things therefore it requires a different form of conflict management. This helps prevent undermining the governing logic. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: An individual may highly value human life but be against abortion rights, but maybe be for the death penalty, or the other way around. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Integrated [[Self-concept|Self Identity]] and [[Authenticity (philosophy)|Authenticity]]''': Bounded emotionality assumes that people have one single [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. This means that that their [[personality]], their [[values]], and their actions are the same no matter where they are physically. The goal of bounded emotionality is to make it easy to be one's [[true self]] while at work. It means you are part of a social collective working toward obtaining goals for your organization. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: If an [[actor]] brings in private experiences to create an original character presentation. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''[[Sense of community|Community]]''': The purpose of bounded emotionality is to create a strong sense of community among its members. There is a need for connections within freedom and for diversity within individuality.  Research has shown this structure works best in smaller organizations. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 ex: When a director encourages questions and then the director discusses performance related critiques with them afterwards developing a sense of togetherness. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Building restoration''' describes a particular treatment approach and philosophy within the field of [[architectural conservation]].

According to the U.S. ''Secretary of Interior's standards'', "Restoration is said as the act or process of accurately depicting the form, features, and character of a property as it appeared at a particular period of time by means of the removal of features from other periods in its history and reconstruction of missing features from the restoration period. The limited and sensitive upgrading of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems and other code-required work to make properties functional is appropriate within a restoration project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intro|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/restore/restore_index.htm|work=Secretary of Interior's Standards for Restoration|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|accessdate=April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010113212/http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/restore/restore_index.htm|archivedate=2011-10-10|df=}} Updated 12/113/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States restoration is different from preservation (American English, ''conservation'' in British English) by allowing the removal of historic materials to create an accurate portrayal of a particular time period, not necessarily the original or final time periods.

==Overview==
[[File:Valletta Großmeisterpalast.JPG|thumb|The [[Grandmaster's Palace in Valletta]], [[Malta]] being restored in 2011.]]
In the field of [[historic preservation]], building restoration is the action or process of accurately revealing, recovering or representing the state of a historic building, as it appeared at a particular period in its history, while protecting its heritage value. Restoration work may be performed to reverse decay, or alterations made to the building(s)

Since Historic Building Conservation is more about fostering a deep appreciation for these famous structures and learning more about why they exist, rather than just keeping historic structures standing tall and looking as beautiful as ever, true historic building preservation aims for a high level of authenticity, accurately replicating historic materials and techniques as much as possible, ideally using modern techniques only in a concealed manner where they will not compromise the historic character of the structure's appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pearlbaycorp.com/historicrestorations.html | title=Historic Building Restoration, Preservation, and Renovation | publisher=Pearl Bay Corporation | accessdate=28 May 2015 | author=Van Sanford, Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance a restoration might involve the replacement of outdated heating and cooling systems with newer ones, or the installation of climate controls that never existed at the time of building after careful study. [[Tsarskoye Selo]], the complex of former royal palaces outside [[St Petersburg]] in [[Russia]] is an example of this sort of work.

Exterior and interior paint colors present similar problems over time. Air pollution, acid rain, and sun take a toll, and often many layers of different paint exist. [[Historic paint analysis]] of old paint layers now allow a corresponding chemical recipe and color to be re-produced. But this is often only a beginning as many of the original materials are either unstable or in many cases environmentally unsound. Many eighteenth century greens were made with arsenic and lead, materials no longer allowed in paints. Another problem occurs when the original pigment came from a material no longer available. For example, in the early to mid-19th century, some browns were produced from bits of ground [[mummy|mummies]]. In cases like this the standards allow other materials with similar appearance to be used and organizations like Britain's [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]] will work with a historic paint color re-creator s to replicate the antique paints in durable, stable, and environmentally safe materials. In the United States the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] is a helpful resource. The [[polychrome]] painted interiors of the [[Vermont State House]] and [[Boston Public Library]] are examples of this type of heritage restoration.

In the United States, the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of Interior]] is the head of the [[National Park Service]] which owns and maintains thousands of historic buildings and has been a leader in historic preservation for over 100 years. The standards were developed in 1975 and updated in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, David E.. ''Guidelines for the evaluation and control of lead-based paint hazards in housing''. Washington D.C.: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 1995. 18-5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The standards deal with the "...materials, features, finishes, spaces, and spatial relationships..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/overview/choose_treat.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122165718/http://www.nps.gov/hps/tps/standguide/overview/choose_treat.htm |archivedate=2013-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of historic buildings and are divided into preservation, rehabilitating, restoration and reconstruction. It helps to understand what building restoration is in context with the other standards:
* '''Preservation''' "places a high premium on the retention of all historic fabric through conservation, maintenance and repair." All materials added to a building over its life are retained and only work which is necessary to protect it from deterioration is carried out.
* '''Rehabilitation''' is a standard for preservation but is more lenient because it presumes the building is so deteriorated that it needs some repairs to prevent further deterioration.
* '''Restoration''' includes preservation, leaving as much material untouched as possible, reconstruction to replace missing elements, and repair work to bring the building to a historically accurate condition in one particular time period. This may include removing some historic building elements (after documenting them) to make the building historically accurate for a specific date in history.
* '''Reconstruction''' allows the re-creation of a missing building or element in all new, appropriate materials.

The first steps in a restoration to the Secretary's standards are to study the building and choose a time period for the restoration. The new use of the building should be consistent with the original use or at least with the time period of the restoration. Materials which were added after the chosen time period must be documented and then may be removed while preserving and repairing the appropriate materials. Materials missing may be reconstructed to "...match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials." which are evidence based. Modern chemical and physical treatments may be gently used if they do not damage the historic materials, and archaeological resources will be preserved or mitigated. The standards recognize that there are inherent conflicts with modern codes and regulations for energy efficiency, health, safety, and accessibility. The standards allow sensitive alterations of historic buildings to meet the spirit of the codes and regulations, if necessary.

==Storm Restoration==

Storm restoration is the restoring of a building due to damage from a severe storm. Most damage is caused by strong wind gusts or hail, but may also include large amounts of rainfall, lightning strikes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Restored chapel|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150426/social/Restored-chapel.565567|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=26 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824110733/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150426/social/Restored-chapel.565567|archivedate=24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as extreme storms such as tornadoes and hurricanes. The majority of storm damage occurs on roofs, sides of structures, and in basements, but over time causes damage to the interior. Unlike heritage restoration, storm restoration takes place on buildings with no historic significance as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uasrc.org/|title=United Association of Storm Restoration Contractors|first=Jacob|last=Sachs|website=uasrc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cancer systems biology merges traditional basic and clinical cancer research with “exact” sciences, such as applied [[mathematics]], [[engineering]], and [[physics]]. It incorporates a spectrum of “omics” technologies ([[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[epigenomics]], etc.) and [[molecular imaging]], to generate computational algorithms and quantitative models&lt;ref name="genome_scale"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis, NE|author2=Abdel-Haleem, AM|title=The evolution of genome-scale models of cancer metabolism|journal=Front.

Application of cancer systems biology include but are not limited to- elucidating critical cellular and molecular networks underlying cancer risk,initiation and progression; thereby promoting an alternative viewpoint to the traditional reductionist approach which has typically focused on characterizing single molecular aberrations.

== History ==

Cancer systems biology finds its roots in a number of events and realizations in biomedical research, as well as in technological advances. Historically cancer was identified, understood, and treated as a monolithic disease.  It was seen as a “foreign” component that grew as a homogenous mass, and was to be best treated by excision.  Besides the continued impact of surgical intervention, this simplistic view of cancer has drastically evolved. In parallel with the exploits of molecular biology, cancer research focused on the identification of critical oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in the etiology of cancer.  These breakthroughs revolutionized our understanding of molecular events driving cancer progression.  Targeted therapy may be considered the current pinnacle of advances spawned by such insights.

Despite these advances, many unresolved challenges remain, including the dearth of new treatment avenues for many cancer types, or the unexplained treatment failures and inevitable relapse in cancer types where targeted treatment exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garraway|author2=Jänne|title=Circumventing cancer drug resistance in the era of personalized medicine|journal=Cancer Discovery|year=2012|volume=2|issue=3|pages=214–226|pmid=22585993|doi=10.1158/2159-8290.CD-12-0012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such mismatch between clinical results and the massive amounts of data acquired by omics technology highlights the existence of basic gaps in our knowledge of cancer fundamentals. Cancer Systems Biology is steadily improving our ability to organize information on cancer, in order to fill these gaps. Key developments include:

* The generation of comprehensive molecular datasets (genome, transcriptome, epigenomics, proteome, metabolome, etc.)

The practice of Cancer Systems Biology requires close physical integration between scientists with diverse backgrounds. Critical large-scale efforts are also underway to train a new workforce fluent in both the languages of biology and applied mathematics. At the translational level, Cancer Systems Biology should engender precision medicine application to cancer treatment.

== Applications ==
* Modelling Cancer Growth and Development
Mathematical modeling can provide useful context for the rational design, validation and prioritization of novel cancer drug targets and their combinations. Network-based modeling and multi-scale modeling have begun to show promise in facilitating the process of effective cancer drug discovery. Using a systems network modeling approach, Schoerberl et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoeberl|first1=B|last2=Kudla|first2=A|last3=Masson|first3=K|last4=Kalra|first4=A|last5=Curley|first5=M|last6=Finn|first6=G|last7=Pace|first7=E|last8=Harms|first8=B|last9=Kim|first9=J|last10=Kearns|first10=J|last11=Fulgham|first11=A|last12=Burenkova|first12=O|last13=Grantcharova|first13=V|last14=Yarar|first14=D|last15=Paragas|first15=V|last16=Fitzgerald|first16=J|last17=Wainszelbaum|first17=M|last18=West|first18=K|last19=Mathews|first19=S|last20=Nering|first20=R|last21=Adiwijaya|first21=B|last22=Garcia|first22=G|last23=Kubasek|first23=B|last24=Moyo|first24=V|last25=Czibere|first25=A|last26=Nielsen|first26=UB|last27=MacBeath|first27=G|title=Systems biology driving drug development: from design to the clinical testing of the anti-ErbB3 antibody seribantumab (MM-121).|journal=NPJ systems biology and applications|date=2017|volume=3|pages=16034|doi=10.1038/npjsba.2016.34|pmid=28725482|pmc=5516865}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified a previously unknown, complementary and potentially superior mechanism of inhibiting the ErbB receptor signaling network. ErbB3 was found to be the most sensitive node, leading to Akt activation; Akt regulates many biological processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis and growth, which are all relevant to tumor progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Z|last2=Deisboeck|first2=TS|title=Mathematical modeling in cancer drug discovery.|journal=Drug Discovery Today|date=February 2014|volume=19|issue=2|pages=145–50|doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2013.06.015|pmid=23831857}}&lt;/ref&gt; This target driven modelling has paved way for first of its kind clinical trials. Bekkal et al. presented a nonlinear model of the dynamics of a cell population divided into proliferative and quiescent compartments. The proliferative phase represents the complete cell cycle (G (1)-S-G (2)-M) of a population committed to divide at its end. The asymptotic behavior of solutions of the nonlinear model is analysed in two cases, exhibiting tissue homeostasis or tumor exponential growth. The model is simulated and its analytic predictions are confirmed numerically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bekkal Brikci|first1=F|last2=Clairambault|first2=J|last3=Ribba|first3=B|last4=Perthame|first4=B|title=An age-and-cyclin-structured cell population model for healthy and tumoral tissues.|journal=Journal of mathematical biology|date=July 2008|volume=57|issue=1|pages=91–110|doi=10.1007/s00285-007-0147-x|pmid=18064465}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Furthermore, advances in hardware and software have enabled the realization of clinically feasible, quantitative multimodality imaging of tissue pathophysiology. Earlier efforts relating to multimodality imaging of cancer have focused on the integration of anatomical and functional characteristics, such as PET-CT and single-photon emission CT (SPECT-CT), whereas more-recent advances and applications have involved the integration of multiple quantitative, functional measurements (for example, multiple PET tracers, varied MRI contrast mechanisms, and PET-MRI), thereby providing a more-comprehensive characterization of the tumour phenotype. The enormous amount of complementary quantitative data generated by such studies is beginning to offer unique insights into opportunities to optimize care for individual patients. Although important technical optimization and improved biological interpretation of multimodality imaging findings are needed, this approach can already be applied informatively in clinical trials of cancer therapeutics using existing tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yankeelov|first1=TE|last2=Abramson|first2=RG|last3=Quarles|first3=CC|title=Quantitative multimodality imaging in cancer research and therapy.|journal=Nature Reviews.

== National funding efforts ==
In 2004, the US National Cancer Institute launched a program effort on Integrative Cancer Systems Biology&lt;ref&gt;NCI Cancer Bulletin. Feb 24, 2004. V1, 8. p5-6&lt;/ref&gt; to establish Centers for Cancer Systems Biology that focus on the analysis of cancer as a complex biological system. The integration of experimental biology with mathematical modeling will result in new insights in the biology and new approaches to the management of cancer. The program brings clinical and basic cancer researchers together with researchers from mathematics, physics, engineering, information technology, imaging sciences, and computer science to work on unraveling fundamental questions in the biology of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gentles|author2=Gallahan|title=Systems biology: confronting the complexity of cancer|journal=Cancer Res|year=2011|volume=71|issue=18|pages=5961–5964|pmid=21896642|doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1569|pmc=3174325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cygnus X-3''' is a [[high-mass X-ray binary]] (HMXB), one of the stronger [[X-ray binary|binary X-ray sources]] in the sky. It is often considered to be a [[Microquasar#Microquasar|microquasar]], and it is believed to be a [[compact object]] in a [[binary system]] which is pulling in a stream of gas from an ordinary [[star]] companion. It is the only known HMXB containing a [[Wolf-Rayet star]].  It is invisible visually, but can be observed at [[radio frequency|radio]], [[infrared]], [[X-ray]], and [[gamma-ray]] wavelengths.

==Observations==
[[File:Cygnus X3.jpg|thumb|left|Cygnus X3 and its X-ray halo]]
Cygnus X-3 is a prominent [[X ray]] source, with soft and hard x-rays both varying in intensity.  Periods where the hard x-rays are at minimum intensity are known as soft states.  It is less than half a degree from a [[gamma-ray]] pulsar, but is itself a weak gamma-ray source. It also shows periodic gamma-ray flares, apparently all occurring during the soft state.&lt;ref name=becklin/&gt;&lt;ref name=tavani/&gt;

It is undetectable at visual wavelengths due to extreme [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] in the [[galactic plane]].  However, there is an [[infrared]] point source at its position.&lt;ref name=koljonen/&gt;  Cygnus X-3 is also notable as one of the very few confirmed sources of [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s, with energies in the 100–1000 [[Electronvolt|TeV]] range.&lt;ref name=zanin/&gt;

Because of the variations in emission at various wavelengths, Cygnus X-3 has been given the [[variable star designation]] V1521 Cygnus.&lt;ref name=gcvs/&gt;

==Flares==
Cygnus X-3 is notable for its intense X-ray emission and ultra-high energy cosmic rays, but it is also remarkable for its gamma-ray and radio flares during which it becomes the brightest radio source in the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name=koljonen2018/&gt;  The gamma-ray flares apparently occur in the quiet radio period before a major radio flare.&lt;ref name=becklin/&gt;&lt;ref name=tavani/&gt;

During the giant radio flares, a [[relativistic jet]] has been resolved within about {{val|14|ul=°}} of being aimed directly towards us.&lt;ref name=koljonen2018/&gt;

==Binary system==
Cygnus X-3 shows consistent variations across all wavelengths with a {{val|4.8|ul=hour}} period.  The nature of the infrared spectrum and the x-ray emission is interpreted as a [[binary system]] containing a [[Wolf-Rayet star|Wolf-Rayet]] (WR) star and a compact object.  The {{val|4.8|u=hour}} variations have been interpreted as eclipses,&lt;ref name=becklin/&gt; but this is thought to be unlikely because there are not well-defined periodic dips in the brightness.&lt;ref name=koljonen/&gt;

The orbit of the binary system is not known accurately, other than the period.  Therefore the masses of the components are not known accurately.  Orbital analysis suggested that the mass of the compact object is less than {{solar mass|5|link=yes}}, probably around {{solar mass|2}}.  It could possibly be a [[neutron star]] but is more likely to be a [[black hole]].&lt;ref name=koljonen/&gt;  The combination of a WR star and a black hole would be the only known example.&lt;ref name=lutovinov/&gt;

While the combination of WR star and compact object would be unique, the WR component will itself almost certainly become a black hole very quickly by astronomical timescales.  The expect [[supernova]] or possible direct collapse to a black hole is expected within a million years or so.  However, modelling of the Cygnus X-3 system suggests it is most likely that the binary will be disrupted by any supernova event.&lt;ref name=belczynski/&gt;

The [[cosmic ray]] events from Cygnus X-3 had previously led to exotic proposals such as a star made of [[quark]]s,&lt;ref name=quark/&gt; but are now explained as being produced in the relativistic jet.  The explanation for the unusual relationship between the x-rays and the gamma-ray and radio flares is that the compact objects produces jets along its axis of rotation, within the dense wind from the WR star.  These jets evacuate a cocoon within the wind when entering the hard state, and are then quenched by the wind when entering the soft state.  Flares are produced during the transition to the hard state as the jets are interacting with the dense wind.&lt;ref name=koljonen2018/&gt;

==Distance==
Cygnus X-3 lies in the direction of the [[Cygnus OB2]] association in the [[Cygnus X (star complex)|Cygnus X]] complex, although it is much further away&lt;ref name=mccollough/&gt;  Its distance can be estimated relative to Cygnus OB2 by studying the X-ray halo produced by dust between us and Cygnus X-3.  The distance to Cygnus OB2 is not known precisely, but this method gives possible distances to Cygnus X-3 of {{val|3.4|u=kpc}} or {{val|9.3|u=kpc}}.&lt;ref name=ling/&gt;

There is a small X-ray source {{val|16|ul="}} from Cygnus X-3 that varies with the same period by a phase lag of about {{val|2.7|u=h}}.  This is thought to be a [[Bok globule]] at approximately the same distance as Cygnus X-2.  Using molecular line emission from this object, two possible distances are found to be {{val|6.1|0.6|u=kpc}} and {{val|7.8|0.6|u=kpc}}.  A statistical mean is {{val|7.4|1.1|u=kpc}}.&lt;ref name=mccollough/&gt;

'''EQOS Energie''' is a corporate group, based in [[Foetz]], [[Luxembourg]]. The company has more than 30 branches in eight countries. EQOS Energie specialises in railway and energy technology, overhead lines, communication technology and technical building services.

Until August 2014, the company operated under the name ALPINE-ENERGIE.&lt;ref name="new owner"&gt;[http://www.triton-partners.com/media/archive/triton-new-owner-of-alpine-energie/ „Triton new owner of ALPINE-ENERGIE“], Press release from Triton. Retrieved November 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  EQOS is an [[acronym]] that stands for '''Excellent Quality Of Services''', and represents the brand promise.&lt;ref name="EQOS DE"&gt;[http://www.eqos-energie.com/en/company/germany „EQOS Energie in Germany“], EQOS Energie. Retrieved November 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
EQOS Energie is owned by the European investment company Triton.

== History ==
Founded as "ENERGIE-Gesellschaft für elektrische und industrielle Unternehmungen mbH" in [[Stuttgart]] by Wilhelm Blättchen in 1920, EQOS Energie has a nearly hundred-year-old company history.&lt;ref name="„Hist“"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=64784199 „Construction and Engineering: Company Overview of EQOS Energie Holding S.à r.l.“], Bloomberg. Retrieved November 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Back then, the business segment was constituted by electrical and industrial enterprises.
In 1978, the subsidiary "ENERGIE Lignes Hautes Tension" was founded in [[Luxembourg]]. 15 years later, the first working group (ARGE) combined their operations with the Austrian “ALPINE Bau GmbH" in a joint venture. In connection with ARGE, a 380-kV forwarding line was set up for the Austrian composite company as were the first steel towers for mobile radio networks. This resulted in the foundation of "ALPINE-ENERGIE Gesellschaft für elektrische und industrielle Unternehmungen GmbH", which is headquartered in [[Linz]], [[Austria]]. Due to the foundation of "ENERGIE-Gesellschaft für Leitungsbau und Kommunikationstechnik AG" in [[Berne]], the company expanded its business into [[Switzerland]]. Entry into the rail sector was marked by "ALPINE ENERGIE’s" launch in the catenary building sector at the Austrian [[St. Valentin]] main railway station in 1999. As a result, the catenary lines there were modernised. Three years later, the ALPINE Group took over the shares owned by Blättchen. While founding the "ALPINE-ENERGIE Holding AG" and "ALPINE-ENERGIE Deutschland GmbH", the business expanded and the company grew quickly.

In 2006, the Spanish building group [[Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas|Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas (FCC)]] became majority shareholder of the ALPINE Group. In the same year, "SAG Kommunikationstechnik" was taken over. Through its acquisition of "SAG Kommunikationstechnik", the company extended its business in Switzerland and Austria. Between 2009 and 2011, "ALPINE-ENERGIE" companies were founded in [[Poland]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Hungary]].&lt;ref name="„Hist“"/&gt;

In 2013, the FCC assumed ownership of ALPINE-ENERGIE, which became a subsidiary of FCC. Subsequently, the company was taken over by [[Triton Fonds]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="new owner"/&gt; Since then, the long-established group member has conducted its business under the name of '''EQOS Energie'''.&lt;ref name="new owner"/&gt; Following the turnaround, as one of the industry’s foremost suppliers, the company realigned its business model in 2015 to address growing market requirements. In a management buy-out, EQOS Energie retired in 2016 from the Swiss market and focused in all service areas on its eight core markets: [[Germany]], Austria, Luxembourg, [[France]], [[Belgium]], Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.

== Business Sector ==
EQOS Energie provides its customers with a wide range of solutions in five business sectors: railway and energy technology, overhead lines, communication technology and technical building services. Its range of activities include consulting, planning and construction as well as maintenance and optimisation. In addition to complete projects the company also offers individual services for various project stages.

Concerning railway technology, EQOS Energie is specialised in the construction of catenary lines, signalling technology and technical equipment in the local and long-distance transport sector. 
The construction of switchgear and substations is the key expertise of the energy technology division. In the production and manufacturing processes, EQOS Energie plans, delivers, installs and maintains all technical facilities. Also, the company offers solutions in the areas of transport and lighting technology in Austria. Given changes in energy policy, EQOS Energie has taken over new construction and increased high-voltage network construction.&lt;ref name="EQOS DE" /&gt; As a nationwide full-service provider, EQOS Energie plans, constructs and maintains mobile communications and fixed networks.
EQOS Energie focuses on technical equipment for buildings and the public sector in Poland and the Czech Republic. The spectrum of services extends from acquisition and construction to maintenance, modernisation and repair of commercial real estate and industrial plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finyear.com/Dr-Helmut-Steurer-is-new-CFO-of-EQOS-Energie-Holding_a36204.html "The Management Board of EQOS Energie now consists of Eric Mendel and Dr. Helmut Steurer"], financial and innovation all the year.

{{Sociology}}

'''Enculturation''' is the process by which people learn the dynamics of their surrounding [[culture]] and acquire values and norms appropriate or necessary in that culture and worldviews.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"&gt;Grusec, Joan E.; Hastings, Paul D. "Handbook of Socialization: Theory and Research", 2007, Guilford Press; {{ISBN|1-59385-332-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59385-332-7}}; p&amp;nbsp;547.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this process, the influences that limit, direct, or shape the individual (whether deliberately or not) include parents, other adults, and peers. If successful, enculturation results in competence in the language, values, and rituals of the culture.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt;

Enculturation is related to [[socialization]]. In some academic fields, socialization refers to the deliberate shaping of the individual. In others, the word may cover both deliberate and informal enculturation.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt;

[[Conrad Phillip Kottak]] (in ''Window on Humanity'') writes:

{{quote|Enculturation is the process where the culture that is currently established teaches an individual the accepted norms and values of the culture or society where the individual lives. The individual can become an accepted member and fulfill the needed functions and roles of the group. Most importantly the individual knows and establishes a context of boundaries and accepted behavior that dictates what is acceptable and not acceptable within the framework of that society. It teaches the individual their role within society as well as what is accepted behavior within that society and lifestyle.}}

''Enculturation'' is sometimes referred to as ''[[acculturation]]'', a word recently used to more distinctively refer only to exchanges of cultural features with foreign cultures. Note that this is a recent development, as ''acculturation'' in some literatures has the same meaning as ''enculturation''.

'''Escapist fiction''' is [[fiction]] that provides a psychological escape from thoughts of everyday life by immersing the reader in exotic situations or activities.

The term is not used favorably, though the condemnation contained in it may be slight. Those who defend works described as escapist from the charge either assert that they are not escapist—such as that a [[science fiction]] novel's satiric aspects address real life—or defend the notion of "escape" as such, not "escapism"—as in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s "[[On Fairy-Stories]]" and [[C. S. Lewis]]'s quotation, in his "On Science Fiction" of Tolkien's question of who would be most hostile to the idea of escape, and his answer: jailers.

Genres that can include elements of escapist fiction include:
* [[Bodice ripper]]s/[[Romance novel]]s
* [[Detective novel]]s
* [[Fantasy fiction]]
* [[Horror fiction]]
* [[Pulp magazines|Pulp fiction]]
* [[Science fiction]]
* [[Spy novel]]s
* [[Thriller (genre)|Thriller]]s

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3311">'''Event tree''' is an inductive analytical diagram in which an event is analyzed using [[Boolean logic]] to examine a chronological series of subsequent events or consequences. For example, event tree analysis is a major component of nuclear reactor safety engineering.&lt;ref name="wang69"&gt;Wang, John '' et al.'' (2000). {{Google books|x4Ft7H_2Ik0C|''What Every Engineer Should Know About Risk Engineering and Management,'' p. 69.|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An event tree displays sequence progression, sequence end states and sequence-specific dependencies across time.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA, [http://www-ns.iaea.org/downloads/ni/training/specific_expert_knowledge/psa-level1/III1_2_A%20Accident%20sequence%20modelling.pdf  "Accident sequence modelling," p. 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytical tool==
[[Event tree analysis]] is a logical evaluative process which works by tracing forward in time or forwards through a causal chain to model risk.  It does not require the premise of a known hazard.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council. (2002). {{Google books|pIKrHQDY-mgC|''Environmental Effects of Transgenic Plants: the Scope and Adequacy of Regulation,'' p. 5.|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; An event tree is an inductive investigatory process.&lt;ref name="wang69"/&gt;

In contrast, the [[Fault tree analysis]] (FTA) evaluates risk by tracing backwards in time or backwards through a cause chain.  The analysis takes as a premise a given hazard.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council, {{Google books|pIKrHQDY-mgC|p. 4.|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FTA is a deductive investigatory process.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, {{Google books|x4Ft7H_2Ik0C|p. 58.|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
An event tree may start from a specific initiator such as loss of critical supply,&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Timeline of the Fukushima I nuclear accidents]]&lt;/ref&gt; or component failure.&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Northeast Blackout of 2003#Causes]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some industries use both fault trees and event trees.  Software has been created for fault tree analysis and event tree analysis and is licensed for use at the world's nuclear power plants for [[Probabilistic Safety Assessment]].

'''Folding@home''' ('''FAH''' or '''F@h''') is a [[distributed computing]] project for disease research that simulates [[protein folding]], computational [[drug design]], and other types of [[molecular dynamics]]. The project uses the [[Idle (CPU)|idle processing resources]] of thousands of [[personal computer]]s owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. Its main purpose is to determine the mechanisms of protein folding, which is the process by which [[protein]]s reach their [[Protein tertiary structure|final three-dimensional structure]], and to examine the causes of [[protein misfolding]]. This is of significant academic interest with major implications for [[medical research]] into [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Huntington's disease]], and many forms of [[cancer]], among other diseases. To a lesser extent, Folding@home also tries to [[Protein structure prediction|predict]] a protein's [[native state|final structure]] and determine how other molecules may [[Protein–ligand docking|interact]] with it, which has applications in drug design. Folding@home is developed and operated by the Pande Laboratory at [[Stanford University]], under the direction of Prof. [[Vijay Pande]], and is shared by various scientific institutions and research laboratories across the world.&lt;ref name="About FAH"/&gt;

The project has pioneered the use of [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs), [[PlayStation&amp;nbsp;3]]s, [[Message Passing Interface]] (used for computing on [[multi-core processor]]s), and some [[Sony Xperia]] smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical [[simulation]] methodology that is a [[paradigm shift]] from traditional computing methods.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002"/&gt; As part of the [[client–server model]] [[network architecture]], the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's [[database server]]s, where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.

Folding@home is one of the world's fastest computing systems, with a speed of approximately 135 [[FLOPS|petaFLOPS]]&lt;ref name="Folding stats"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=osstats2 | title = Client Statistics by OS | author = Pande lab | publisher = Stanford University | accessdate = 2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2018|01|2|alt=as of January 2018}}. This performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run [[Analysis of algorithms|computationally costly]] atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than formerly achieved. Since its launch on October&amp;nbsp;1, 2000, the Pande Lab has produced 139 [[Academic publishing|scientific research papers]] as a direct result of Folding@home.&lt;ref name="papers"/&gt; Results from the project's simulations agree well with experiments.&lt;ref name="10.1021/ja9090353"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.1003962107"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1038/nature01160"/&gt;

[[File:Protein folding.png|thumb|300px|A protein before and after folding. It starts in an unstable [[random coil]] state and finishes in its native state conformation.]]

[[Protein]]s are an essential component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within [[Cell (biology)|biological cell]]s. They often act as [[enzyme]]s, performing biochemical reactions including [[cell signaling]], molecular transportation, and [[Cell cycle#Regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle|cellular regulation]]. As structural elements, some proteins act as a type of [[cytoskeleton|skeleton for cells]], and as [[antibodies]], while other proteins participate in the [[immune system]]. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional structure]], a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its [[amino acid]] sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its [[native state]]. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a ''holy grail'' of [[computational biology]].&lt;ref name="10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000452"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1126/science.309.5731.78b"/&gt; Despite folding occurring within a [[macromolecular crowding|crowded cellular environment]], it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may [[protein misfolding|misfold]], that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently [[Protein aggregation|aggregate]] and cause a variety of debilitating diseases.&lt;ref name="10.1002/iub.117"/&gt; Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011"/&gt;

Due to the complexity of proteins' conformation or [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds,&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1146/annurev.biophys.34.040204.144447"/&gt; before 2010 simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales.&lt;ref name="10.1021/ja9090353"/&gt; General-purpose [[supercomputer]]s have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong [[scalability|scaling]] of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult.&lt;ref name="978-1-58603-796-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1002/bip.10219"/&gt; Moreover, as protein folding is a [[stochastic process]] and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1137/06065146X"/&gt;

[[File:ACBP MSM from Folding@home.tiff|left|thumb|400px|Folding@home uses [[Markov state model]]s, like the one diagrammed here, to model the possible shapes and folding pathways a protein can take as it condenses from its initial randomly coiled state (left) into its native 3-D structure (right).]]
Protein folding does not occur in one step.&lt;ref name="10.1002/iub.117"/&gt; Instead, proteins spend most of their folding time, nearly 96% in some cases,&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2011.12.001"/&gt; ''waiting'' in various intermediate [[protein conformation|conformational]] states, each a local [[thermodynamic free energy]] minimum in the protein's [[energy landscape]]. Through a process known as [[adaptive sampling]], these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a [[Hidden Markov model|Markov state model]] (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are [[discrete-time]] [[master equation]] models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on [[GPUGRID]]) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories.&lt;ref name="Simulation FAQ"/&gt; The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear [[parallelization]], leading to an approximately four [[orders of magnitude]] reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's [[phase space]] (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1021/ct900620b"/&gt;

Between 2000 and 2010, the length of the proteins Folding@home has studied have increased by a factor of four, while its timescales for protein folding simulations have increased by six orders of magnitude.&lt;ref name="typepad: how far FAH has come"/&gt; In 2002, Folding@home used Markov state models to complete approximately a million [[CPU]] days of simulations over the span of several months,&lt;ref name="10.1038/nature01160"/&gt; and in 2011, MSMs parallelized another simulation that required an aggregate 10&amp;nbsp;million CPU hours of computing.&lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.1010880108"/&gt; In January 2010, Folding@home used MSMs to simulate the dynamics of the slow-folding 32-[[amino acid|residue]] NTL9 protein out to 1.52&amp;nbsp;milliseconds, a timescale consistent with experimental folding rate predictions but a thousand times longer than formerly achieved. The model consisted of many individual trajectories, each two orders of magnitude shorter, and provided an unprecedented level of detail into the protein's energy landscape.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1021/ja9090353"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.3390/ijms11125292"/&gt; In 2010, Folding@home researcher Gregory Bowman was awarded the [[Thomas Kuhn#Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award|Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award]] from the [[American Chemical Society]] for the development of the [[open-source software|open-source]] MSMBuilder software and for attaining quantitative agreement between theory and experiment.&lt;ref name="2010 KPS award"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSMBuilder source"/&gt; For his work, Pande was awarded the 2012 Michael and Kate Bárány Award for Young Investigators for "developing field-defining and field-changing computational methods to produce leading theoretical models for protein and [[RNA]] folding",&lt;ref name="Biophysical society names recipients"/&gt; and the 2006 Irving Sigal Young Investigator Award for his simulation results which "''have stimulated a re-examination of the meaning of both ensemble and single-molecule measurements, making Dr. Pande's efforts pioneering contributions to simulation methodology.''"&lt;ref name="FAH Awards"/&gt;

== Biomedical research ==
Protein misfolding can result in a [[proteopathy|variety of diseases]] including Alzheimer's disease, [[cancer]], [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]], [[cystic fibrosis]], Huntington's disease, [[sickle-cell anemia]], and [[type&amp;nbsp;II diabetes]].&lt;ref name="10.1002/iub.117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Protein Misfolding Diseases"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt; Cellular infection by viruses such as [[HIV]] and [[influenza]] also involve folding events on [[cell membrane]]s.&lt;ref name="978-0-340-66316-5"/&gt; Once protein misfolding is better understood, therapies can be developed that augment cells' natural ability to regulate protein folding.  Such [[therapies]] include the use of engineered molecules to alter the production of a given protein, help destroy a misfolded protein, or assist in the folding process.&lt;ref name="10.1038/nature02265"/&gt; The combination of computational molecular modeling and experimental analysis has the possibility to fundamentally shape the future of molecular medicine and the [[drug design|rational design of therapeutics]],&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011"/&gt; such as expediting and lowering the costs of [[drug discovery]].&lt;ref name="10.1093/bib/bbp023"/&gt; The goal of the first five years of Folding@home was to make advances in understanding folding, while the current goal is to understand misfolding and related disease, especially Alzheimer's.&lt;ref name="Press FAQ"/&gt;

The simulations run on Folding@home are used in conjunction with laboratory experiments,&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt; but researchers can use them to study how folding ''[[in vitro]]'' differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011 Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a [[ribosome|ribosomal]] exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process.&lt;ref name="forum: 7808/7809 to FAH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.0608256104"/&gt; Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturants]] to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, and it is difficult to experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of [[Protein&amp;nbsp;L]], and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.&lt;ref name="10.1021/ja908369h"/&gt;

The Pande Lab is part of Stanford University, a [[non-profit organization|non-profit entity]], and does not sell the results generated by Folding@home.&lt;ref name="Main FAQ"/&gt; The large data sets from the project are freely available for other researchers to use upon request and some can be accessed from the Folding@home website.&lt;ref name="typepad: Simbios"/&gt;&lt;ref name="papers for free"/&gt; The Pande lab has collaborated with other molecular dynamics systems such as the [[Blue Gene]] supercomputer,&lt;ref name="10.1038/sj.embor.7400108"/&gt; and they share Folding@home's key software with other researchers, so that the algorithms which benefited Folding@home may aid other scientific areas.&lt;ref name="typepad: Simbios"/&gt; In 2011, they released the open-source Copernicus software, which is based on Folding@home's MSM and other parallelizing methods and aims to improve the efficiency and scaling of molecular simulations on large [[computer cluster]]s or [[supercomputer]]s.&lt;ref name="Pronk et al, 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Copernicus download"/&gt; Summaries of all scientific findings from Folding@home are posted on the Folding@home website after publication.&lt;ref name="papers"/&gt;

=== Alzheimer's disease ===
{{Multiple image|footer= Alzheimer's disease is linked to the aggregation of amyloid beta protein fragments in the brain (right). Researchers have used Folding@home to simulate this aggregation process, to better understand the cause of the disease.|image1= Amyloid 01big1.jpg|image2= Amyloid 02big1.jpg|image3= Amyloid 03big1.jpg}}

[[Alzheimer's disease]] is an incurable [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disease which most often affects the elderly and accounts for more than half of all cases of [[dementia]]. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a [[proteopathy|protein misfolding disease]]. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic [[protein aggregation|aggregations]] of the [[amyloid beta]] (Aβ) [[peptide]], caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger [[senile plaques]], a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name="10.2119/2007-00100.Irvine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1001/archneurol.2007.56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1074/jbc.R800036200"/&gt; Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.&lt;ref name="10.1063/1.3010881"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1371/journal.pone.0021776"/&gt;

Preventing Aβ aggregation is a promising method to developing therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease, according to Drs. Naeem and Fazili in a [[literature review]] article.&lt;ref name="10.1007/s12013-011-9200-x"/&gt; In 2008, Folding@home simulated the dynamics of Aβ aggregation in atomic detail over timescales of the order of tens of seconds. Prior studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds. Folding@home was able to simulate Aβ folding for six orders of magnitude longer than formerly possible. Researchers used the results of this study to identify a [[beta hairpin]] that was a major source of molecular interactions within the structure.&lt;ref name="10.1038/cr.2010.57"/&gt; The study helped prepare the Pande lab for future aggregation studies and for further research to find a small peptide which may stabilize the aggregation process.&lt;ref name="10.1063/1.3010881"/&gt;

In December 2008, Folding@home found several small drug candidates which appear to inhibit the toxicity of Aβ aggregates.&lt;ref name="typepad: possible alz. drug"/&gt; In 2010, in close cooperation with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, these drug leads began to be tested on [[biological tissue]].&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt; In 2011, Folding@home completed simulations of several [[mutation]]s of Aβ that appear to stabilize the aggregate formation, which could aid in the development of therapeutic drug therapies for the disease and greatly assist with experimental [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] studies of Aβ [[oligomer]]s.&lt;ref name="10.1371/journal.pone.0021776"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1021/jm201332p"/&gt; Later that year, Folding@home began simulations of various Aβ fragments to determine how various natural enzymes affect the structure and folding of Aβ.&lt;ref name="forum: 6871"/&gt;&lt;ref name="description: 6571"/&gt;

=== Huntington's disease ===
[[Huntington's disease]] is a neurodegenerative [[genetic disorder]] that is associated with protein misfolding and aggregation. [[Polyglutamine tract|Excessive repeats]] of the [[glutamine]] amino acid at the [[N-terminus]] of the [[Huntingtin protein]] cause aggregation, and although the behavior of the repeats is not completely understood, it does lead to the cognitive decline associated with the disease.&lt;ref name="10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1"/&gt; As with other aggregates, there is difficulty in experimentally determining its structure.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.jmb.2009.01.032"/&gt; Scientists are using Folding@home to study the structure of the Huntingtin protein aggregate and to predict how it forms, assisting with [[rational drug design]] methods to stop the aggregate formation.&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt; The N17 fragment of the Huntington protein accelerates this aggregation, and while there have been several mechanisms proposed, its exact role in this process remains largely unknown.&lt;ref name="10.1038/nchembio.279"/&gt; Folding@home has simulated this and other fragments to clarify their roles in the disease.&lt;ref name="forum: 8021 in beta"/&gt; Since 2008, its drug design methods for Alzheimer's disease have been applied to Huntington's.&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt;

=== Cancer ===
More than half of all known cancers involve [[mutations]] of [[p53]], a [[tumor suppressor]] protein present in every cell which regulates the [[cell cycle]] and signals for [[cell death]] in the event of damage to [[DNA]]. Specific mutations in p53 can disrupt these functions, allowing an abnormal cell to continue growing unchecked, resulting in the development of [[tumors]]. Analysis of these mutations helps explain the root causes of p53-related cancers.&lt;ref name="10.1126/science.1905840"/&gt; In 2004, Folding@home was used to perform the first molecular dynamics study of the refolding of p53's [[protein dimer]] in an [[water model|all-atom simulation of water]]. The simulation's results agreed with experimental observations and gave insights into the refolding of the dimer that were formerly unobtainable.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.jmb.2004.10.083"/&gt; This was the first [[peer review]]ed publication on cancer from a distributed computing project.&lt;ref name="FAH publishes cancer results"/&gt; The following year, Folding@home powered a new method to identify the amino acids crucial for the stability of a given protein, which was then used to study mutations of p53. The method was reasonably successful in identifying cancer-promoting mutations and determined the effects of specific mutations which could not otherwise be measured experimentally.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.jmb.2005.12.083"/&gt;

Folding@home is also used to study [[chaperone (protein)|protein chaperones]],&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt; [[heat shock protein]]s which play essential roles in cell survival by assisting with the folding of other proteins in the [[Macromolecular crowding|crowded]] and chemically stressful environment within a cell. Rapidly growing cancer cells rely on specific chaperones, and some chaperones play key roles in [[chemotherapy]] resistance. Inhibitions to these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient chemotherapy drugs or for reducing the spread of cancer.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.biopha.2011.04.025"/&gt; Using Folding@home and working closely with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, the Pande lab hopes to find a drug which inhibits those chaperones involved in cancerous cells.&lt;ref name="typepad: nanomedicine ce"/&gt; Researchers are also using Folding@home to study other molecules related to cancer, such as the enzyme [[Src kinase]], and some forms of the [[Engrailed (gene)|engrailed]] [[homeodomain]]: a large protein which may be involved in many diseases, including cancer.&lt;ref name="typepad: protomol b4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="description: 180"/&gt; In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the small [[Trefoil knot fold|knottin]] protein EETI, which can identify [[carcinoma]]s in [[medical imaging|imaging scan]]s by binding to [[cell surface receptor|surface receptor]]s of cancer cells.&lt;ref name="forum: 7600 in beta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="description: 7600"/&gt;

[[Interleukin 2]] (IL-2) is a protein that helps [[T cell]]s of the [[immune system]] attack pathogens and tumors. Unfortunately, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to serious side effects such as [[pulmonary edema]]. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth. [[Pharmaceutical companies]] have expressed interest in the mutant molecule, and the [[National Institutes of Health]] are testing it against a large variety of tumor models to try to accelerate its development as a therapeutic.&lt;ref name="scientists boost IL-2 potency"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1038/nature10975"/&gt;

=== Osteogenesis imperfecta ===
[[Osteogenesis imperfecta]], known as brittle bone disease, is an incurable genetic bone disorder which can be lethal. Those with the disease are unable to make functional connective bone tissue. This is most commonly due to a mutation in [[Type-I collagen]],&lt;ref name="10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16051-0"/&gt; which fulfills a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref name="978-0-387-73905-2"/&gt; The mutation causes a deformation in [[Collagen helix|collagen's triple helix structure]], which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.bpj.2009.04.059"/&gt; In 2005, Folding@home tested a new [[quantum mechanical]] method that improved upon prior simulation methods, and which may be useful for future computing studies of collagen.&lt;ref name="10.1002/jcc.20301"/&gt; Although researchers have used Folding@home to study collagen folding and misfolding, the interest stands as a pilot project compared to [[Alzheimer]]'s and Huntington's research.&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt;

=== Viruses ===
Folding@home is assisting in research towards preventing some [[virus]]es, such as [[influenza]] and [[HIV]], from recognizing and entering [[Cell (biology)|biological cells]].&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt; In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the enzyme [[RNase H]], a key component of HIV, to try to design drugs to deactivate it.&lt;ref name="forum: 10125"/&gt; Folding@home has also been used to study [[membrane fusion]], an essential event for [[viral entry|viral infection]] and a wide range of biological functions. This fusion involves [[conformational change]]s of viral fusion proteins and [[protein docking]],&lt;ref name="978-0-340-66316-5"/&gt; but the exact molecular mechanisms behind fusion remain largely unknown.&lt;ref name="10.1039/c0cs00115e"/&gt; Fusion events may consist of over a half million atoms interacting for hundreds of microseconds. This complexity limits typical computer simulations to about ten thousand atoms over tens of nanoseconds: a difference of several orders of magnitude.&lt;ref name="10.1038/cr.2010.57"/&gt; The development of models to predict the mechanisms of membrane fusion will assist in the scientific understanding of how to target the process with antiviral drugs.&lt;ref name="Peter Kasson"/&gt; In 2006, scientists applied Markov state models and the Folding@home network to discover two pathways for fusion and gain other mechanistic insights.&lt;ref name="10.1038/cr.2010.57"/&gt;

Following detailed simulations from Folding@home of small cells known as [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]], in 2007, the Pande lab introduced a new computing method to measure the [[topology]] of its structural changes during fusion.&lt;ref name="10.1093/bioinformatics/btm250"/&gt; In 2009, researchers used Folding@home to study mutations of [[Hemagglutinin (influenza)|influenza hemagglutinin]], a protein that attaches a virus to its [[Host (biology)|host]] cell and assists with viral entry. Mutations to hemagglutinin affect [[binding affinity|how well the protein binds]] to a host's [[cell surface receptor]] molecules, which determines how [[infectivity|infective]] the virus strain is to the host organism.  Knowledge of the effects of hemagglutinin mutations assists in the development of [[antiviral drug]]s.&lt;ref name="10.1021/ja904557w"/&gt;&lt;ref name="19209725, 2811693"/&gt; As of 2012, Folding@home continues to simulate the folding and interactions of hemagglutinin, complementing experimental studies at the [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: kasson update"/&gt;

=== Drug design ===
[[Drug]]s function by [[ligand binding|binding]] to [[binding site|specific locations]] on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a [[conformational change]]. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, it is difficult to precisely determine where and [[binding affinity|how tightly]] two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current ''[[in silico]]'' methods usually must trade speed for [[accuracy]]; e.g., use rapid [[protein docking]] methods instead of computationally costly [[free energy calculation]]s. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability.&lt;ref name="Press FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: drug design methods"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1063/1.2221680"/&gt; Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery.&lt;ref name="10.1093/bib/bbp023"/&gt; In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the [[villin]] protein to within 1.8 [[angstrom]] (Å) [[root mean square deviation]] (RMSD) from the [[crystalline structure]] experimentally determined through [[X-ray crystallography]]. This accuracy has implications to future [[protein structure prediction]] methods, including for [[intrinsically unstructured proteins]].&lt;ref name="10.1038/cr.2010.57"/&gt; Scientists have used Folding@home to research [[drug resistance]] by studying [[vancomycin]], an antibiotic [[drug of last resort]], and [[beta-lactamase]], a protein that can break down antibiotics like [[penicillin]].&lt;ref name="description: 10721"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: drug targets"/&gt;

Chemical activity occurs along a protein's [[active site]]. Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to this site and blocking its activity, under the assumption that the target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain [[allosteric site]]s which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very [[Analysis of algorithms|computationally costly]]. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were used to identify allosteric sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, [[interleukin-2]], and [[RNase H]].&lt;ref name="typepad: drug targets"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.1209309109"/&gt;

Approximately half of all known [[antibiotic]]s interfere with the workings of a bacteria's [[ribosome]], a large and complex biochemical machine that performs [[protein biosynthesis]] by [[translation (biology)|translating]] [[messenger RNA]] into proteins. [[Macrolide antibiotics]] clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a [[grant (money)|grant]] to study and design new antibiotics.&lt;ref name="diseases FAQ"/&gt; In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it.&lt;ref name="10.1073/pnas.0801795105"/&gt; The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated [[ribosomal protein]]s, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.&lt;ref name="description: 5765"/&gt;

[[File:Folding@home participation per client.png|thumb|left|300px|Folding@home's participation from April 2004 to October 2012. Total active clients (green) is broken down to those from CPUs (blue), GPUs (red), and PlayStation&amp;nbsp;3s (orange).]]

In addition to reporting active processors, Folding@home determines its computing performance as measured in floating point operations per second ([[FLOPS]]) based on the actual execution time of its calculations. Originally this was reported as native FLOPS: the raw performance from each given type of processing hardware.&lt;ref name="FLOPS FAQ"/&gt; In March 2009 Folding@home began reporting the performance in native and x86 FLOPS,&lt;ref name="typepad: FLOPS"/&gt; the latter being an estimation of how many FLOPS the calculation would take on a standard [[x86]] CPU architecture, which is commonly used as a performance reference. Specialized hardware such as GPUs can efficiently perform some complex functions in one floating point operation which otherwise needs multiple operations on the x86 architecture. The x86 measurement attempts to even out these hardware differences.&lt;ref name="FLOPS FAQ"/&gt; Despite conservative conversions, the GPU clients' x86 FLOPS are consistently greater than their native FLOPS and comprise a large majority of Folding@home's measured computing performance.&lt;ref name="FAH osstats2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PS3 FAQ"/&gt;

In 2007, [[Guinness World Records]] recognized Folding@home as the most powerful distributed computing network.&lt;ref name="guinness most powerful DC"/&gt; As of September 30, 2014, the project has 107,708 active CPU cores and 63,977 active GPUs for a total of 40.190 x86 petaFLOPS (19.282 native petaFLOPS).&lt;ref name="FAH osstats2"/&gt; At the same time, the combined efforts of all distributed computing projects under [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing|BOINC]] totals 7.924 petaFLOPS.&lt;ref name="BOINC credit overview"/&gt; In November 2012, Folding@home updated its accounting of FLOPS, especially for GPUs, and now reports the number of active processor cores and physical processors.&lt;ref name="typepad: new stats page"/&gt; Using the Markov state model method, Folding@home achieves [[strong scaling]] across its user base and gains a linear [[speedup]] for every added processor.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006"/&gt; This network allows Folding@home to do work that was formerly impractical computationally.&lt;ref name="10.1038/sj.embor.7400108"/&gt;

In March 2002, [[Google]] cofounder [[Sergey Brin]] launched [[Google Compute]] as an add-on for the [[Google Toolbar]].&lt;ref name="news: Google supercomputing"/&gt; Although limited in function and scope, it increased participation in Folding@home from 10,000, up to about 30,000 active CPUs.&lt;ref name="Biotech 27"/&gt; The program ended in October 2005, in favor of the official Folding@home clients, and is no longer available for the Toolbar.&lt;ref name="idle time precious"/&gt; Folding@home also gained participants from [[Genome@home]], another distributed computing project from the Pande lab and a sister project to Folding@home. The goal of Genome@home was [[protein design]] and associated applications. Following its official conclusion in March 2004, users were asked to donate computing power to Folding@home instead.&lt;ref name="G@h updates"/&gt;

=== Performance ===
[[File:Folding@home and Supercomputer Computational Powers.png|thumb|right|400px|Computing power of Folding@home and the fastest supercomputer from April 2004 to October 2012. Between June 2007 and June 2011, Folding@home (red) exceeded the performance of [[Top500]]'s fastest supercomputer (black). However it was eclipsed by [[K computer]] in November 2011 and [[Blue Gene/Q]] in June 2012.&lt;sup id="Note 1 back"&gt;[[#Note 1|Note 1]]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

On September 16, 2007, due in large part to the participation of PlayStation 3 consoles, the Folding@home project officially attained a sustained performance level higher than one native petaFLOPS, becoming the first computing system of any kind to do so.&lt;ref name="typepad: crossing 1 PF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.008"/&gt; [[Top500]]'s fastest supercomputer at the time was [[BlueGene/L]], at 0.280 petaFLOPS.&lt;ref name="Top500 June 2007"/&gt; The following year, on May 7, 2008, the project attained a sustained performance level higher than two native petaFLOPS,&lt;ref name="FAH reaches 2 PF"/&gt; followed by the three and four native petaFLOPS milestones on August 2008&lt;ref name="Nvidia-FAH milestone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="3 PF barrier"/&gt; and September 28, 2008 respectively.&lt;ref name="past 4 petaFLOPS"/&gt; On February 18, 2009, Folding@home achieved five native petaFLOPS,&lt;ref name="typepad: FAH passes 5 PF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crossing 5 PF barrier"/&gt; and was the first computing project to meet these five levels.&lt;ref name="Community Grid Computing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="review of FAH"/&gt; In comparison, November 2008's fastest supercomputer was [[IBM]]'s [[IBM Roadrunner|Roadrunner]] at 1.105 petaFLOPS.&lt;ref name="Top500 November 2008"/&gt; On November 10, 2011, Folding@home's performance exceeded six native petaFLOPS with the equivalent of nearly eight x86 petaFLOPS.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.cub.2012.01.008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="6 petaFLOPS"/&gt; In mid-May 2013, Folding@home attained over seven native petaFLOPS, with the equivalent of 14.87 x86 petaFLOPS. It then reached eight native petaFLOPS on June 21, followed by nine on September 9 of that year, with 17.9 x86 petaFLOPS.&lt;ref name="FAH stats doc"/&gt; On May 11, 2016 Folding@home announced that it was moving towards reaching the 100 x86 petaFLOPS mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Petaflops nearly reached|url=https://folding.stanford.edu/home/closing-in-on-100-petaflops|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Points ==
Similarly to other distributed computing projects, Folding@home quantitatively assesses user computing contributions to the project through a credit system.&lt;ref name="Points FAQ"/&gt; All units from a given protein project have uniform base credit, which is determined by benchmarking one or more work units from that project on an official reference machine before the project is released.&lt;ref name="Points FAQ"/&gt; Each user receives these base points for completing every work unit, though through the use of a passkey they can receive added bonus points for reliably and rapidly completing units which are more demanding computationally or have a greater scientific priority.&lt;ref name="Passkey FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SMP2 release"/&gt; Users may also receive credit for their work by clients on multiple machines.&lt;ref name="Main FAQ"/&gt; This point system attempts to align awarded credit with the value of the scientific results.&lt;ref name="Points FAQ"/&gt;

Users can register their contributions under a team, which combine the points of all their members. A user can start their own team, or they can join an existing team.&lt;ref name="FAH homepage"/&gt; In some cases, a team may have their own community-driven sources of help or recruitment such as an [[Internet forum]].&lt;ref name="Extreme overclocking forum"/&gt; The points can foster friendly competition between individuals and teams to compute the most for the project, which can benefit the folding community and accelerate scientific research.&lt;ref name="Points FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MaximumPC Chimp Challenge"/&gt; Individual and team statistics are posted on the Folding@home website.&lt;ref name="Points FAQ"/&gt;

If a user does not form a new team, or does not join an existing team, that user automatically becomes part of a "Default" team. This "Default" team has a team number of "0". Statistics are accumulated for this "Default" team as well as for specially named teams.

== Software ==
Folding@home software at the user's end involves three primary components: work units, cores, and a client.

=== Work units ===
A work unit is the protein data that the client is asked to process. Work units are a fraction of the simulation between the states in a Markov state model. After the work unit has been downloaded and completely processed by a volunteer's computer, it is returned to Folding@home servers, which then award the volunteer the credit points.  This cycle repeats automatically.&lt;ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/&gt; All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a work unit is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirement for Folding@home is a Pentium&amp;nbsp;3 450&amp;nbsp;MHz CPU with [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] (SSE).&lt;ref name="Main FAQ"/&gt; However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as a major part of the scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.&lt;ref name="SMP FAQ"/&gt;

Before public release, work units go through several [[quality assurance]] steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home.&lt;ref name="typepad: more transparency"/&gt; Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, except in the rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution.&lt;ref name="forum: Gromacs cannot continue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forum: 6803(4,66,255)"/&gt; The Folding@home support forum can be used to differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.&lt;ref name="forum: troubleshooting bad WUs"/&gt;

=== Cores ===
{{main|List of Folding@home cores}}
Specialized molecular dynamics programs, referred to as "FahCores" and often abbreviated "cores", perform the calculations on the work unit as a [[background process]]. A large majority of Folding@home's cores are based on [[GROMACS]],&lt;ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/&gt; one of the fastest and most popular molecular dynamics software packages, which largely consists of manually optimized [[assembly language]] code and hardware optimizations.&lt;ref name="10.1002/jcc.20703"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1021/ct700301q"/&gt; Although GROMACS is [[open-source software]] and there is a cooperative effort between the Pande lab and GROMACS developers, Folding@home uses a [[closed-source]] license to help ensure data validity.&lt;ref name="Gromacs FAQ"/&gt; Less active cores include ProtoMol and SHARPEN. Folding@home has used [[AMBER]], [[CPMD]], [[Desmond (software)|Desmond]], and [[TINKER]], but these have since been retired and are no longer in active service.&lt;ref name="Open Source FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAQ index"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: update on new FahCores"/&gt; Some of these cores perform [[explicit water model|explicit solvation]] calculations in which the surrounding [[solvent]] (usually water) is modeled atom-by-atom; while others perform [[implicit solvation]] methods, where the solvent is treated as a mathematical continuum.&lt;ref name="10.1002/jcc.21209"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Petaflop FAQ"/&gt; The core is separate from the client to enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update. The cores periodically create calculation [[application checkpointing|checkpoints]] so that if they are interrupted they can resume work from that point upon startup.&lt;ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/&gt;

=== Client ===
A Folding@home participant installs a [[client (computing)|client]] [[computer program|program]] on their [[personal computer]]. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics.&lt;ref name="Uni Guide"/&gt; The computer clients run continuously in the [[background (computer software)|background]] at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected.&lt;ref name="FAH homepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Main FAQ"/&gt; The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings.&lt;ref name="Uni Guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forum: can FAH damage PC?"/&gt; The client connects to a Folding@home [[server (computing)|server]] and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to [[uniprocessor]] and [[multi-core processor]] systems, and [[graphics processing unit]]s. The diversity and power of each [[hardware architecture]] provides Folding@home with the ability to efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.&lt;ref name="Press FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SMP FAQ"/&gt;

Professional software developers are responsible for most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development.&lt;ref name="typepad: how does dev get done"/&gt; Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Stanford's Folding@home data servers (over [[Computer port (software)|port]]&amp;nbsp;8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit [[digital signature]]s.&lt;ref name="Main FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Uninstall"/&gt; While the client's [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) is open-source,&lt;ref name="FAHControl source code"/&gt; the client is [[proprietary software]] citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.&lt;ref name="FAH license"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forum: FAH EULA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="help ubuntu"/&gt;

However, this rationale of using proprietary software is disputed since while the license could be enforceable in the legal domain retrospectively, it doesn't practically prevent the modification (also known as [[Patch (computing)|patching]]) of the executable [[binary file]]s. Likewise, [[binary-only software|binary-only]] distribution does not prevent the malicious modification of executable binary-code, either through a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] while being downloaded via the internet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/the-case-of-the-modified-binaries The Case of the Modified Binaries, Josh Pitts, October 23, 2014; retrieved on 2016-11-23]&lt;/ref&gt; or by the redistribution of binaries by a third-party that have been previously modified either in their binary state (i.e. [[Patch (computing)|patched]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-02/clowes/bh-us-02-clowes-binaries.ppt Fixing/Making Holes in ELF Binaries/Programs - Black Hat]&lt;/ref&gt; or by decompiling&lt;ref&gt;probably using tools such as [https://github.com/thorkill/eresi ERESI]&lt;/ref&gt; and recompiling them after modification.&lt;ref&gt;[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4309771/disassembling-modifying-and-then-reassembling-a-linux-executable x86 - Disassembling, modifying and then reassembling a Linux executable - Stack Overflow]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/185/how-do-i-add-functionality-to-an-existing-binary-executable linux - How do I add functionality to an existing binary executable? - Reverse Engineering Stack Exchange]&lt;/ref&gt; Unless the binary files - and/or the transport channel - are [[digital signature|signed]] and the recipient person/system is able to verify the digital signature, in which case unwarranted modifications should be detectable, but not always.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Nipravsky-Certificate-Bypass-Hiding-And-Executing-Malware-From-A-Digitally-Signed-Executable-wp.pdf |title=Certificate Bypass: Hiding and Executing Malware from a Digitally Signed Executable |publisher=[[Deep Instinct]] |website=BlackHat.com |date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, since in the case of Folding@Home the input data and output result processed by the client-software are both digitally signed,&lt;ref name="Main FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Uninstall"/&gt; the integrity of work can be verified independently from the integrity of the client software itself.

Folding@home uses the [[Cosm (software)|Cosm]] software libraries for networking.&lt;ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: how does dev get done"/&gt; Folding@home was launched on October&amp;nbsp;1, 2000, and was the first distributed computing project aimed at bio-molecular systems.&lt;ref name="10.1039/C1CP22100K"/&gt; Its first client was a [[screensaver]], which would run while the computer was not otherwise in use.&lt;ref name="10.1126/science.290.5498.1903"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive summary"/&gt; In 2004, the Pande lab collaborated with [[David P. Anderson]] to test a supplemental client on the open-source BOINC framework. This client was released to closed beta in April 2005;&lt;ref name="FAH for BOINC soon"/&gt; however, the method became unworkable and was shelved in June 2006.&lt;ref name="High-Per FAQ"/&gt;

==== Graphics processing units ====
The specialized hardware of [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) is designed to accelerate rendering of 3-D&amp;nbsp;graphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs are one of the most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing [[general-purpose computing on graphics processing units]] (GPGPU). However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture.&lt;ref name="10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01012.x"/&gt; Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the [[open-source software|open-source]] [[OpenMM]] [[library (computing)|library]], which uses a [[bridge pattern|bridge design pattern]] with two [[application programming interface]] (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.&lt;ref name="10.1002/jcc.21209"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1109/MCSE.2010.27"/&gt;

Before 2010, the computing reliability of GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was largely unknown, and circumstantial evidence related to the lack of built-in [[error detection and correction]] in GPU memory raised reliability concerns. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home network detected [[soft error]]s in the memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware traits, such as software-side error detection.&lt;ref name="10.1109/CCGRID.2010.84"/&gt;

The first generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was released to the public on October&amp;nbsp;2, 2006,&lt;ref name="High-Per FAQ"/&gt; delivering a 20-30X speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based [[GROMACS]] counterparts.&lt;ref name="ATI FAQ"/&gt; It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations.&lt;ref name="typepad: GPU news"/&gt;&lt;ref name="978-3-642-14389-2"/&gt; GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of [[General-purpose computing on graphics processing units|GPGPU]] software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with [[DirectX]], on April&amp;nbsp;10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client.&lt;ref name="ATI FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: GPU2 open beta"/&gt; Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;ref name="ATI FAQ"/&gt; Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on [[ATI (brand)|ATI]] and [[CUDA]]-enabled [[Nvidia]] GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation.&lt;ref name="typepad: GPU2 goes live"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: GPU2 going well"/&gt; Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May&amp;nbsp;25, 2010. While [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities,&lt;ref name="typepad: GPU3 prep"/&gt; and used OpenMM on top of an [[OpenCL]] framework.&lt;ref name="typepad: GPU3 prep"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: GPU3 open beta"/&gt; Although these GPU3 clients did not natively support the operating systems [[Linux]] and [[macOS]], Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able to run them through the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] software application.&lt;ref name="forum: 7.1.38 released"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forum: GPU3 headless guide"/&gt; GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in [[FLOPS]]. As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.&lt;ref name="FAH osstats2"/&gt;

Native support for Nvidia and AMD graphics cards under Linux was introduced with FahCore 17, which uses OpenCL rather than CUDA.&lt;ref name="forum: core17 Linux"/&gt;

==== PlayStation 3 ====
{{further|Life with PlayStation}}
[[File:LifeWithPlayStation Folding.jpg|thumb|280px|The PlayStation 3's ''Life With PlayStation'' client displays a 3-D animation of the protein being folded]]

From March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took advantage of the computing power of [[PlayStation 3]]s. At the time of its inception, its main [[stream processing|streaming]] [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell processor]] delivered a 20x speed increase over PCs for some calculations, processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the [[Xbox 360]].&lt;ref name="Press FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biotech 27"/&gt; The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to [[Amdahl's law]], and significantly changed the tradeoff between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models at little added computing cost.&lt;ref name="10.1002/jcc.21054"/&gt; This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise infeasible computationally.&lt;ref name="cnn ps3"/&gt;

The PS3 client was developed in a collaborative effort between [[Sony]] and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March&amp;nbsp;23, 2007.&lt;ref name="Press FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PS3 to study cancer"/&gt; Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s.&lt;ref name="PS3 research project"/&gt; On September&amp;nbsp;18 of the following year, the PS3 client became a channel of [[Life with PlayStation]] on its launch.&lt;ref name="Life With PS3 live"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: life with PS"/&gt; In the types of calculations it can perform, at the time of its introduction, the client fit in between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed.&lt;ref name="10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922"/&gt; However, unlike CPUs and GPUs, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home.&lt;ref name="cnn ps3"/&gt; The PS3's uniform console environment made [[technical support]] easier and made Folding@home more [[user friendly]].&lt;ref name="Press FAQ"/&gt; The PS3 also has the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizing of the current protein dynamics.&lt;ref name="10.1002/jcc.21054"/&gt;

On November 6, 2012, Sony concluded support for the Folding@home PS3 client and other services available under Life with PlayStation. Over its lifetime of five years and 7 months, more than 15 million users contributed over 100 million hours of computing to Folding@home, greatly assisting the project with disease research. Following discussions with the Pande lab, Sony decided to terminate the application. Pande considered the PlayStation 3 client a "game changer" for the project.&lt;ref name="PS3 FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PS3 4.30 update, drop F@h"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LWP termination"/&gt;

==== Multi-core processing client ====
Folding@home can use the [[parallel computing]] abilities of modern multi-core processors. The ability to use several CPU cores simultaneously allows completing the full simulation far faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single work units proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This method is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to be performed in the same amount of time, and reduces the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors.&lt;ref name="typepad: what does SMP do"/&gt; A 2007 publication in the ''[[Journal of Molecular Biology]]'' relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the [[villin]] protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.jmb.2007.09.069"/&gt;

In November 2006, first-generation [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) clients were publicly released for open beta testing, referred to as SMP1.&lt;ref name="High-Per FAQ"/&gt; These clients used [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as at that time the GROMACS cores were [[Thread-safe|not designed]] to be used with multiple threads.&lt;ref name="SMP FAQ"/&gt; This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI.&lt;ref name="typepad: new client dev"/&gt; Although the clients performed well in [[Unix]]-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS, they were troublesome under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].&lt;ref name="typepad: what does SMP do"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: new client dev"/&gt; On January&amp;nbsp;24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]-based implementation.&lt;ref name="SMP2 release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: how does dev get done"/&gt;

SMP2 supports a trial of a special category of ''bigadv'' work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive and have a great scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores,&lt;ref name="bigadv"/&gt; which was raised to sixteen later, on February&amp;nbsp;7, 2012.&lt;ref name="typepad: update on bigadv-16"/&gt; Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as [[random-access memory]] (RAM) and [[Internet bandwidth]]. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system.&lt;ref name="typepad: bigadv points change"/&gt; The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing [[Computer cluster#Compute clusters|clusters]] and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home.&lt;ref name="bigadv"/&gt; Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Vijay Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://folding.stanford.edu/home/revised-plans-for-bigadv-ba-experiment/ |title=Revised plans for BigAdv (BA) experiment |author=Vijay Pande |date=January 15, 2014 |access-date=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== V7 ====
[[File:F@h v7 novice shot.png|thumb|400px|A sample image of the V7 client in Novice mode running under [[Windows&amp;nbsp;7]]. In addition to a variety of controls and user details, V7 presents work unit information, such as its state, calculation progress, ETA, credit points, identification numbers, and description.]]

The V7 client is the seventh and latest generation of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior clients for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]] operating systems.&lt;ref name="V7 install guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: V7 in open beta"/&gt; It was released on March&amp;nbsp;22, 2012.&lt;ref name="typepad: v7 rollout"/&gt; Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low priority, allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients.&lt;ref name="typepad: ATI core 16 released"/&gt; V7 uses [[Trac]] for [[Bug tracking system|managing its bug tickets]] so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.&lt;ref name="typepad: V7 in open beta"/&gt;

V7 consists of four integrated elements. The user typically interacts with V7's open-source [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], named FAHControl.&lt;ref name="FAHControl source code"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ticket #736"/&gt; This has Novice, Advanced, and Expert user interface modes, and has the ability to monitor, configure, and control many remote folding clients from one computer. FAHControl directs FAHClient, a [[backend as a service|back-end]] application that in turn manages each FAHSlot (or ''slot''). Each slot acts as replacement for the formerly distinct Folding@home v6 uniprocessor, SMP, or GPU computer clients, as it can download, process, and upload work units independently. The FAHViewer function, modeled after the PS3's viewer, displays a real-time 3-D rendering, if available, of the protein currently being processed.&lt;ref name="V7 install guide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="typepad: V7 in open beta"/&gt;

==== Google Chrome ====
In 2014, a client for the [[Google Chrome]] and [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] web browsers was released, allowing users to run Folding@home in their web browser.  The client uses [[Google]]'s [[Native Client]] (NaCl) feature on Chromium-based web browsers to run the Folding@Home code at near-native speed in a [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] on the user's machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pande|first1=Vijay|title=Adding a completely new way to fold, directly in the browser|url=https://folding.stanford.edu/home/adding-a-completely-new-way-to-fold-directly-in-the-browser/|website=folding.stanford.edu|publisher=Pande Lab, Stanford University|access-date=13 February 2015|date=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison to other molecular simulators ==
[[Rosetta@home]] is a distributed computing project aimed at protein structure prediction and is one of the most accurate [[tertiary structure]] predictors.&lt;ref name="10.1002/prot.21804"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1002/prot.22210"/&gt; The conformational states from Rosetta's software can be used to initialize a Markov state model as starting points for Folding@home simulations.&lt;ref name="Simulation FAQ"/&gt; Conversely, structure prediction algorithms can be improved from thermodynamic and kinetic models and the sampling aspects of protein folding simulations.&lt;ref name="10.1371/journal.pone.0005840"/&gt; As Rosetta only tries to predict the final folded state, and not how folding proceeds, Rosetta@home and Folding@home are complementary and address very different molecular questions.&lt;ref name="Simulation FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="F@H vs R@h"/&gt;

[[Anton (computer)|Anton]] is a special-purpose supercomputer built for molecular dynamics simulations. In October 2011, Anton and Folding@home were the two most powerful molecular dynamics systems.&lt;ref name="typepad: comparison with Anton"/&gt; Anton is unique in its ability to produce single ultra-long computationally costly molecular trajectories,&lt;ref name="10.1021/ja207470h"/&gt; such as one in 2010 which reached the millisecond range.&lt;ref name="10.1145/1654059.1654099"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1126/science.1187409"/&gt; These long trajectories may be especially helpful for some types of biochemical problems.&lt;ref name="10.1145/1364782.1364802"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155245"/&gt; However, Anton does not use Markov state models (MSM) for analysis. In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-[[microsecond|µs]] Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories.&lt;ref name="10.1021/ja207470h"/&gt; In June 2011 Folding@home began added sampling of an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its methods compare to Anton's.&lt;ref name="forum: 7610/7611 in beta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="description: 7610"/&gt; However, unlike Folding@home's shorter trajectories, which are more amenable to distributed computing and other parallelizing methods, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein's [[phase space]]. Due to this, it is possible that a combination of Anton's and Folding@home's simulation methods would provide a more thorough sampling of this space.&lt;ref name="10.1021/ja207470h"/&gt;

== Notes ==
&lt;cite id="Note 1"&gt;[[#Note 1 back|Note 1:]]&lt;/cite&gt; Supercomputer FLOPS performance is assessed by running the legacy [[LINPACK]] benchmark. This short-term testing has difficulty in accurately reflecting sustained performance on real-world tasks because LINPACK more efficiently maps to supercomputer hardware. Computing systems vary in architecture and design, so direct comparison is difficult. Despite this, FLOPS remain the primary speed metric used in supercomputing.&lt;ref name="forum: GPU flop conversion 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="supercomputer only technically the fastest"/&gt; In contrast, Folding@home determines its FLOPS using [[wall clock time]] by measuring how much time its work units take to complete.&lt;ref name="forum: vs PPD numbers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forum: vs PPD numbers 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="forum: GPU flops conversion"/&gt;

'''Geekcorps''' is a [[non-profit organization]] that sends people with technical skills to developing countries to assist in [[computer]] [[infrastructure]] development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Mar/26/tc/tc02a.html|title=Geekcorps spread computer skills worldwide|last=Yaukey|first=John|date=March 26, 2002|website=The Honolulu Advertiser|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/t/story?id=98890&amp;page=1|title=Non-Profit Sends Tech Skills to Africa|last=|first=|date=January 7, 2006|website=ABC News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-profit was created in 2000 by [[Ethan Zuckerman]] and Elisa Korentayer in [[North Adams, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/featured_articles/001019thursday.html|title=A Techie Volunteer Corps|website=www.nytimes.com|access-date=2017-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001 Geekcorps became a division of the [[International Executive Service Corps]] located in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfdCaZshLZMC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=Geekcorps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi61bqBmZnUAhUDJiYKHVSMD0QQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Geekcorps&amp;f=false|title=The Role of Information and Communication Technologies in Global Development: Analyses and Policy Recommendations|last=Haqqani|first=Abdul Basit|date=2005|publisher=United Nations Publications|isbn=9789211045321|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation ==
After a visit to a Ghana library by Zuckerman in 1993, the lack of up-to-date resources available prompted him to create Geekcorps years later.  Humanitarian and banker Elisa Korentayer became co-founder of Geekcorps due to the organization's need of financial wisdom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In effort to increase access to current information and bridge the [[digital divide]] in developing nations Zuckerman, and associates from his now bought out internet company [[Tripod.com|tripod]], funded most of the $350,000 budget for Geekcorps' first year.

== Major projects ==

=== Ghana ===
Starting September 2000, with 6 volunteers selected from over 200 applicants, Geekcorps first mission was in [[Accra|Accra, Ghana]].  Co-founder Zuckerman was already familiar with the infrastructure of Ghana.  Zuckerman stated, "The government has relatively liberal telecommunications and investment policies, making it possible for IT businesses to be built there."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Geekcorps initial focus in Ghana was assisting Accran companies with its [[Information technology|IT]] expertise.  Geekcorps had an understanding with local businesses, after receiving help, the businesses involved were to help the locals with their newfound resources.  Initial challenges for Geekcorps were communication and teaching skills needed by volunteers, and reliance on outdated programming languages for local businesses.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CjkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Geekcorps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi61bqBmZnUAhUDJiYKHVSMD0QQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=iesc&amp;f=false|title=InfoWorld|last=Inc|first=InfoWorld Media Group|date=2001-07-23|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geekcorps involvement lead to innovations such as a new java based payment system for local businesses in Ghana.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Geekcorps was also instrumental in the creation of Ghana's internet exchange in 2005.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/geekcorps-a-peace-corps-for-techies/|title=Geekcorps: A Peace Corps for techies|work=CNET|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mali ===
Initial assistance in [[Mali]] came from the CMRT (Community Mobilization through Radio Technology) program sponsored by [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]]. Under CMRT, Geekcorps installed 5 radio stations to enable local communication through the area. Later under another program Radio for Peace Building, Geekcorps installed another 11 stations, and renovations were done to older existing stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iesc.org/geekcorps|title=ICT &amp; Applied Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=IESC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geekcorps set up [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] stations in less populated areas of Mali in 2006. These stations were updated by a memory stick delivered from a computer center with internet access in [[Ouelessebougou]]. Although this allowed many rural locations access to specific web resources, such as web pages and digital media, due to lack of interest the program was modified after a year. Yearly updates to more desired information such as Moulin, a French version of Wikipedia, became the focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencealert.com/opinions/20092402-18834.html|title=Rural Internet Goes by Road|last=Nightingale|first=Katherine|work=ScienceAlert|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intel Partnership and OLPC Astroturf Controversy==
In 2007 Geekcorps Director Wayan Vota was accused of disparaging the OLPC project through a "OLPC News" website without disclosing Geekcorps' promotion of Intel's rival laptop, the [[Classmate PC]] and Microsoft's [[Windows XP]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222204738/http://www.0xdeadbeef.com:80/weblog/?p=252|title=conspiracy theories about olpcnews?

'''Generative adversarial networks''' ('''GANs''') are a class of [[artificial intelligence]] algorithms used in [[unsupervised machine learning]], implemented by a system of two [[neural network]]s contesting with each other in a [[zero-sum game]] framework. They were introduced by [[Ian Goodfellow]] ''et al.'' in 2014.&lt;ref name="GANs"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1406.2661|title=Generative Adversarial Networks|first1=Ian |last1=Goodfellow |first2=Jean |last2=Pouget-Abadie |first3=Mehdi |last3=Mirza |first4=Bing |last4=Xu |first5=David |last5=Warde-Farley |first6=Sherjil |last6=Ozair |first7=Aaron |last7=Courville |first8=Yoshua |last8=Bengio |class=cs.LG |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This technique can generate photographs that look at least superficially authentic to human observers, having many realistic characteristics (though in tests people can tell real from generated in many cases).&lt;ref name="ITT_GANs"&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1606.03498|title=Improved Techniques for Training GANs|last1=Salimans |first1=Tim |last2=Goodfellow |first2=Ian |last3=Zaremba |first3=Wojciech |last4=Cheung |first4=Vicki |last5=Radford |first5=Alec |last6=Chen |first6=Xi |class=cs.LG |year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
One network [[Generative model|generates]] candidates (generative) and the other [[Discriminative model|evaluates them]] (discriminative).&lt;ref name="MyUser_Arxiv.org_April_7_2016c"&gt;{{cite arXiv|class=stat.ML|first2=Jean|last2=Pouget-Abadie|title=Generative Adversarial Networks|eprint=1406.2661|last1=Goodfellow|first1=Ian J.|last3=Mirza|first3=Mehdi|last4=Xu|first4=Bing|last5=Warde-Farley|first5=David|last6=Ozair|first6=Sherjil|last7=Courville|first7=Aaron|last8=Bengio|first8=Yoshua|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DAGUI"&gt;Thaler, SL, US Patent 05659666, Device for the autonomous generation of useful information, 08/19/1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DABUI"&gt;Thaler, SL, US Patent, 07454388, Device for the autonomous bootstrapping of useful information, 11/18/2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia of creativity"&gt;Thaler, SL, The Creativity Machine Paradigm, Encyclopedia of Creativity, Invention, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship, (ed.) E.G. Carayannis, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the generative network learns to map from a [[Latent variable|latent space]] to a particular data distribution of interest, while the discriminative network discriminates between instances from the true data distribution and candidates produced by the generator. The generative network's training objective is to increase the error rate of the discriminative network (i.e., "fool" the discriminator network by producing novel synthesised instances that appear to have come from the true data distribution).&lt;ref name="MyUser_Arxiv.org_April_7_2016c" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luc|first=Pauline|last2=Couprie|first2=Camille|last3=Chintala|first3=Soumith|last4=Verbeek|first4=Jakob|date=2016-11-25|title=Semantic Segmentation using Adversarial Networks|journal=NIPS Workshop on Adversarial Training, Dec , Barcelona, Spain|volume=2016|arxiv=1611.08408|bibcode=2016arXiv161108408L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, a known dataset serves as the initial training data for the discriminator. Training the discriminator involves presenting it with samples from the dataset, until it reaches some level of accuracy. Typically the generator is seeded with a randomized input that is sampled from a predefined latent space&lt;ref name = "DAGUI"/&gt; (e.g. a [[multivariate normal distribution]]). Thereafter, samples synthesized by the generator are evaluated by the discriminator. [[Backpropagation]] is applied in both networks &lt;ref name = "DABUI"/&gt; so that the generator produces better images, while the discriminator becomes more skilled at flagging synthetic images.&lt;ref name="OpenAI_com"&gt;{{citation |url=http://openai.com/blog/generative-models/ |title=Generative Models |publisher=[[OpenAI]] |date=  |authors=[[Andrej Karpathy]], [[Pieter Abbeel]], Greg Brockman, Peter Chen, Vicki Cheung, Rocky Duan, Ian Goodfellow, Durk Kingma, Jonathan Ho, Rein Houthooft, Tim Salimans, John Schulman, Ilya Sutskever, And Wojciech Zaremba|accessdate= April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The generator is typically a deconvolutional neural network, and the discriminator is a [[convolutional neural network]].

The idea to infer models in a competitive setting (model versus discriminator) was proposed by Li, Gauci and Gross in 2013.&lt;ref name="Li-etal-GECCO2013"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their method is used for behavioral inference. It is termed Turing Learning,&lt;ref name="TuringLearning2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Wei|last2=Gauci|first2=Melvin|last3=Groß|first3=Roderich|title=Turing learning: a metric-free approach to inferring behavior and its application to swarms|journal=Swarm Intelligence|date=30 August 2016|volume=10|issue=3|pages=211–243|doi=10.1007/s11721-016-0126-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the setting is akin to that of a [[Turing test]]. Turing Learning is a generalization of GANs.&lt;ref name="Gross-etal-NIPS2017"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models other than neural networks can be considered. Moreover, the discriminators are allowed to influence the processes from which the datasets are obtained, making them active interrogators as in the Turing test. The idea of adversarial training can also be found in earlier works, such as Schmidhuber in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidhuber|first=Jürgen|date=November 1992|title=Learning Factorial Codes by Predictability Minimization|journal=Neural Computation|language=en|volume=4|issue=6|pages=863–879|doi=10.1162/neco.1992.4.6.863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
GANs have been used to produce samples of [[photorealistic]] images for the purposes of visualizing new [[interior design|interior]]/[[industrial design]], shoes, bags and [[clothing]] items or items for [[PC game|computer game]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s' scenes.{{Citation needed|reason=No source provided. How does a GAN do this?|date=February 2018}} These networks were reported to be used by [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenemeier|first1=Larry|title=When Will Computers Have Common Sense?

The system focused on realistic textures rather than pixel-accuracy. The result was a higher image quality at high magnification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Sajjadi|first=Mehdi S.

GANs were used to create the 2018 painting ''[[Edmond de Belamy]]'' which sold for $432,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/arts/design/ai-art-sold-christies.html | title=AI Art at Christie's Sells for $432,500| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2018-10-25| last1=Cohn| first1=Gabe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, a [[deepfake]] video of [[Donald Trump]] chastising Belgium citizens to abandon the [[Paris Agreement]] was circulated in an attempt to prioritize [[climate change]].  The video, produced using GAN technology, had been commissioned by Belgian political party [[Socialistische Partij Anders]] (sp.a) and uploaded to their [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] accounts.   Widely believed true, the video provoked hundreds of comments on social media until sp.a owned up to their forgery.&lt;ref name="schwartz-2018"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3560">'''Green Hour''' is a core concept of the U.S. [[National Wildlife Federation]]'s '''Be Out There''' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwf.org/Be-Out-There.aspx NWF's "Be Out There" program website]&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was created in response to a growing disconnect between nature and children, a condition dubbed [[nature deficit disorder]] by Richard Louv&lt;ref&gt;[http://richardlouv.com/ Author Richard Louv's website]&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''[[Last Child in the Woods]]''. One of the primary symptoms of nature deficit disorder, according to Louv, is the replacement of outdoor activities (or "green time") with "screen time"—hours that are spent in front of computers, televisions and other electronic devices.

The [[National Wildlife Federation]] recommends that parents give their kids a "Green Hour" every day, a time for unstructured play and interaction with the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwf.org/Be-Out-There/Why-Be-Out-There.aspx NWF's "Why Be Out There" web page]&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of NWF's strategy called [[Reversing Nature Deficit]]. The Green Hour program teaches that unstructured play can take place in a garden, a backyard, a nearby park, or any place that provides safe and accessible green spaces where children can learn and play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/360/story/551908.html Miami Herald article about Green Hour]&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Hour's web site was launched by NWF's Education department in March 2007 as a resource for parents and caregivers, attempting to provide the information, inspiration, tools and community needed to make "green hours" part of every family's daily routine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/18/AR2007061801808_pf.html Washington Post article about Green Hour]&lt;/ref&gt; Green Hour cites a Kaiser Family Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kff.org/ Kaiser Family Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; study which found the average American child spends 44 hours per week-more than six hours per day-staring at some kind of electronic screen. Studies have also linked excessive television viewing to obesity, violence, and even lower intelligence in kids.

Each week, Green Hour publishes a new issue of its Discovery Journal with a new outdoor theme. The Journal has several tabs: "Book Nook," which provides reading for kids of different ages, "Make &amp; Do," which provides outdoor activities and crafts and "Did You Know." which provides facts about nature.

The Green Hour blog&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenhour.org/content/blog NWF's Green Hour Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; presents different perspectives on the rise in children's "screen-time" and practical ways of reconnecting youth to nature. The Green Hour Community Corner&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenhour.org/content/community NWF's Green Hour Community Corner]&lt;/ref&gt; allow users to sign up as members and talk with other parents and caregivers. NatureFind&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwf.org/NatureFind.aspx NWF's Green Hour NatureFind]&lt;/ref&gt; is a feature on the site that allows users to submit their zip code and find all the parks, trails and other natural areas nearby.

'''Henry C. Groseclose''' was born on May 17, 1892.&lt;ref name="The HMDB"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prats|first=J.J|title=Henry C. Groseclose|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=44219|publisher=The Historical Marker Database|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in Ceres, Virginia for most of his life.&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt; Mr. Groseclose completed his junior college degree from [[Washington and Lee University]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=agedteachers&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillson|first=John|title=The Role of Agricultural Education Teacher Educator Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow|url=http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jae/pdf/vol39/39-01-01.pdf|publisher=pubs.aged.tamu.edu|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, he also received his [[bachelor’s degree]], as well as his [[master’s degree]], in [[agricultural education]] from [[Virginia Tech]].&lt;ref name="agedteachers"/&gt; While Mr. Groseclose was an agriculture teacher at the [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute]], he, along with three other agriculture teachers, [[Walter Stephenson Newman|Walter Newman]], [[Edmund Magill]] and [[Harry Sanders]], decided to establish a club for the farm boys in the school. The organization was formed in 1925.&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt; Groseclose named the organization the [[Future Farmers of Virginia]], or FFV for short.&lt;ref name=VirginiaRole&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillson|first=John|title=The Role of Virginia in the Development of the FFA|url=http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jae/pdf/vol34/34-02-37.pdf|publisher=pubs.aged.tamu.edu|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


The original meaning for the abbreviation FFV stood for the [[First Families of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="VirginiaRole"/&gt; The “first families” referred to the families of both [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref name="VirginiaRole"/&gt; Referring to Washington and Jefferson, Groseclose once stated that, “The Future Farmers of America should follow the example of these great sons of early Virginia by using scientific knowledge, intelligence, and enthusiasm to the end that agriculture may again be known as the profession of the real aristocrat.”&lt;ref name=AgriculturalSocieties&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hillson |first1=John |title=Agricultural Societies as Antecedents of the FFA |url=http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jsaer/pdf/Vol51/51-00-102.pdf |publisher=pubs.aged.tamu.edu |accessdate=4 June 2013|author2=Bryant, Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groseclose wrote the by-laws, as well as the constitution that the FFV would be based on.&lt;ref name="VirginiaRole"/&gt; 


In 1926, he also wrote, and brought into play, the formal ceremony that would take place as an organizational pattern to structure each meeting.&lt;ref name="AgriculturalSocieties"/&gt; Two years later, in 1928, the FFV became a nationwide organization. This developed the organization that is known today as the Future Farmers of America, or The [[National FFA Organization]], or just FFA for short. The by-laws drawn up by Henry Groseclose became the foundation of the newly national organization.&lt;ref name="VirginiaRole"/&gt; Also, the formal ceremony that Groseclose developed was taken on by the FFA as a national ritual that is still used today.&lt;ref name="AgriculturalSocieties"/&gt; Groseclose was a seventh degree [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]] member,&lt;ref name="AgriculturalSocieties"/&gt; and he was also involved with the [[Free mason|Masons]], so it was no surprise when he developed levels of memberships for the FFV, which transferred through to the FFA, that were similar to the three leveled membership structure that the Masons uses. These three levels included the Greenhand, the Virginia Farmer and the Virginia Planter.&lt;ref name="VirginiaRole"/&gt; 


While the official emblem of the National FFA Organization was being drawn, Groseclose’s original emblem, which he hand drew himself, was highly considered and ended up playing a part in the emblem that is still the emblem of the National FFA Organization today.&lt;ref name=VirginiaFFA&gt;{{cite web|last=Virginia Association of Agricultural Educators and FFA Alumni|title=Virginia's Role in the Development of the FFA|url=http://www.vaffa.org/History/VirginiaFFA.html|publisher=Virginia FFA|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The part of the emblem that was from Mr. Groseclose’s original drawing included a background setting of a half [[plow]]ed wheat field with an [[owl]] perched upon a spade of wheat in front of the field.&lt;ref name="VirginiaFFA"/&gt; 


Henry Groseclose served as the Executive Secretary of the National FFA Organization for two years between 1928 and 1930.&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt; During his office of Executive Secretary, he announced at the national convention of 1930 that he had written, and would be releasing, an official FFA manual, which outlined the organization, procedures and structures of the National FFA Organization.&lt;ref name="Historical Review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoover|first1=Tracy|title=A Historical Review of Leadership Development in the FFA and 4-H|url=http://www.jae-online.org/attachments/article/167/Hoover_etal_48_3_100-110.pdf|publisher=jae-online|accessdate=4 June 2013|author2=Scholl, Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Groseclose also served as the Treasurer of the National FFA Organization for 11 years, between 1930 and 1941.&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt; 


In September 1925, Henry Groseclose set his expectations for the members of the FFV, and the purpose of the establishment of the Future Farmers of Virginia was by saying, "In my opinion the farm boys of Virginia who are enrolled in vocational agriculture are equal to any other group of boys in the state. But somehow the boys themselves seem to have a feeling of inferiority. Especially is this true when the farm boy goes to the city and has to compete with his city cousin. This condition should not exist. I believe that a strong organization of our boys in agriculture would help them to overcome this handicap. Let's form an organization that will give them a greater opportunity for self-expression and for the development of leadership. In this way they will develop confidence in their own ability and pride in the fact that they are farm boys."&lt;ref name=HistoryofFFA&gt;{{cite web|last=Virginia Association of Agricultural Educators and FFA Alumni|title=History of the FFA|url=http://www.vaffa.org/History/History.html|publisher=Virginia FFA|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Henry C. Groseclose died on June 4, 1950.&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt; In 2002, the [[Department of Historic Resources]] established a marker in Mr. Groseclose’s honor. It is Marker number KC-5 and it is displayed in [[Bland County, Virginia|Bland County]] of [[Ceres, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="The HMDB" /&gt;

[[File:How to draw manga.jpg|thumb|The cover of ''How to Draw Manga: Bodies &amp; Anatomy'']]
'''''How to Draw Manga''''' is a series of instructional books on drawing [[manga]] published by Graphic-sha, by a variety of authors. Originally in Japanese for the Japanese market, many volumes have been translated into English and published in the United States. Of the wide range of manga-how-tos available for westerners, the series is seen as one of the more useful, both for its provenance and wide range of practical tips.{{ref|twoeasylessons}} The English-language volumes in the series were co-produced by Graphic-sha and two other Japanese companies, Japanime Co. Ltd. and Japan Publications Trading Co.

&lt;!-- The quotation marks and em-dash are part of the story's title --&gt;
'''''"If This Goes On—"''''' is a [[science fiction]] novella by American writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]], first serialized in 1940 in [[Astounding (magazine)|''Astounding Science-Fiction'']] and revised and expanded for inclusion in the 1953 collection ''[[Revolt in 2100]]''. The novella shows what might happen to Christianity in the United States given mass communications, applied psychology, and a hysterical populace. The novel is part of Heinlein's [[Future History (novel)|''Future History'']] series.

In 2016 the story won the 1941 [[Hugo Award|Retro-Hugo Award]] for Best Novella of 1940 at the 2016 WorldCon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1941-retro-hugo-awards/ 1941 Retro-Hugos] at the Hugo Awards website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The story is set in a future [[theocratic]]  American society, ruled by the latest in a series of fundamentalist Christian "Prophets". The First Prophet was Nehemiah Scudder, a backwoods preacher turned [[President of the United States|President]] (elected in 2012), then [[dictator]] (no elections were held in 2016 or later).

John Lyle, a junior army officer under the Prophet, is stationed at the Prophet's capital of [[New Jerusalem#In popular culture|New Jerusalem]]. Devout at this point, he finds himself questioning his faith when he falls for one of the Prophet's Virgins, Sister Judith. Judith, new to the vocation, faints when she is called upon to render sexual service to the Prophet and is confined to her quarters until she sees the light. John confides in his far more worldly roommate, Zeb Jones, who is not only not shocked, but who assists John. A clandestine meeting with Judith goes awry when they are forced to kill a spy, leaving them no choice but to seek aid from the Cabal, an underground revolutionary movement (Judith's friend, Sister Magdalene, is a member). The two men are inducted into the Cabal, while remaining on duty in their army posts. Judith is arrested and tortured as part of the investigation into the death of the spy, and John and Zeb rescue her, though leaving enough clues that John is soon arrested and tortured himself. He gives little away, and is himself rescued by the Cabal. Zeb and Magdalene have evaded arrest, thanks to a clandestine distress signal that John manages to leave for Zeb while being arrested.

Judith is spirited out of the country before John regains consciousness, and John is given a false identity in order to make his way to Cabal headquarters. He is detected en route, forced to flee, and arrives safely after several misadventures. He finds that Zeb and Magdalene, who he assumes are a couple, have made their way there before him. All take on significant roles in bringing to fruition the revolutionary plot, John as an aide to the commander, General Huxley.

While working there, John receives a literal [[Dear John letter|"Dear John" letter]] from Judith, informing him of her impending marriage to a Mexican man she met while getting refuge in his country. He learns that Zeb and Magdalene have no marriage plans, and begins a romance with Magdalene.

The revolutionary plot is mostly successful, and the country, other than New Jerusalem, is seized. But the capital must also be conquered lest it serve as a rallying point for loyalists. Even as constitutional discussions go on, tempered to provide the greatest possible individual freedom (this is the origin of the 'Covenant' mentioned in other Heinlein works), the new regime's troops prepare to take New Jerusalem. John and Magdalene are married just before the assault.

During the fight, Huxley is wounded, and John must take over temporary command, though not entitled by rank to do so. He gives the orders that bring victory. He then turns over command to the senior unwounded general, and leads a squad invading the Prophet's private quarters. They find that he has been viciously killed by his own Virgins.

==Freemasonry==
The Cabal uses terminology associated with [[Freemasonry]], and there are hints that the Masons are actually one of the groups involved in the loosely organized revolt against the government. (Heinlein himself was not a Mason,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heinleinsociety.org/rah/FAQrah.html FAQ: Heinlein the Person&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but had considered joining the Masons as a young man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.arts.sf.written/r8ezDGQDfMM/R-jJIVm6HbEJ|title=Re: Heinlein and freemasonry?|date=October 13, 2006|author=Bill Patterson|newsgroup=rec.arts.sf.written|message-id=1155484574.561507.148190@m79g2000cwm.googlegroups.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Critical reception==
[[Damon Knight]] wrote of the novel:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Damon|year=1967|title=[[In Search of Wonder]]|location=Chicago|publisher=Advent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Revolution...has always been a favorite theme in science fiction.  It's romantic, it's reliable, and—as a rule—it's as phony as a Martian princess.

Who but Heinlein ever pointed out, as he does here in detail, that a modern revolution is big business?  And who but Heinlein would have seen that fraternal organizations, for thirty years the butt of highbrow American humor, would make the perfect nucleus for an American underground against tyranny?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Connections with other works by Heinlein==
While set in Heinlein's ''Future History'', the story is self-contained and has little connection with other works in the series. However, it is noted in ''[[Methuselah's Children]]'' that, during the time of this story, the secret of the Howard Families was held close (being a prize that was beyond the power of the Prophet to confiscate), and also that the Cabal assisted in helping the Howards maintain their Masquerade, the concealment of the existence of the Howards. [[Lazarus Long]] specifically mentions that he spent the period of the Interregnum, when the Prophets ruled the United States and space travel was forbidden, mostly on Venus.

The story also depicts the start of the negotiations which would lead to the Covenant, the somewhat idealized basis for government depicted in "[[Coventry (short story)|Coventry]]", "[[Misfit (short story)|Misfit]]" and in ''Methuselah's Children''.

Scudder was previously mentioned in passing in the short story "[[Logic of Empire]]" and later on in Heinlein’s final novel ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]''. A story about the rise of Scudder, "The Sound of His Wings", is contained in the Future History timeline, but was never written by Heinlein, who stated in the afterword to ''Revolt in 2100'': "I will probably never write the story of Nehemiah Scudder, I dislike him too much". Also, a story called "The Stone Pillow", which would have depicted the earlier foredoomed opposition to the Theocracy, never got written, Heinlein noting that there was "too much tragedy in real life".

The 1940 version of ''"If This Goes On—"'' was believed to be Heinlein's first novel&lt;ref&gt;# {{cite journal
 | author=Bill Patterson
 | url = http://www.heinleinsociety.org/rah/works/novels/ifthisogoeson.html
 | title = A Study of ‘If This Goes On—’ | journal=The Heinlein Journal
 | issue=7 | year=2000
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until the unpublished work ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs]]'' was discovered in 2003.&lt;ref name="rule20030831"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heinleinsociety.org/newsFUTL.html | title=The finding and publishing of "For Us, the Living" | publisher=The Heinlein Society | date=2003-08-31 | accessdate=March 6, 2012 | author=Rule, Deb Houdek}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the earlier, unpublished novel Scudder, though coming very close to gaining power, is stopped at the last moment by the mobilization of Libertarians.

Ward Carson wrote: "In ''For Us, The Living'', space colonization waits until the end of the Twenty-First Century and Scudder is defeated; in the ''Future History'' it happens a century earlier and Scudder takes over the US. Heinlein made no explicit remark on this, but a causal connection could be made: in the Future History the bold individualistic Americans emigrated into space in the end of the Twentieth Century, and were not present in America to stop it from falling into the fanatic's hands".&lt;ref&gt;Ward G. Carson, "The Formative Years of Science Fiction" in Ed Woods (ed.) ''Round Table on Speculative Literature'', London, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inconnu Art Group''' (later the '''Inconnu Independent Art Group''') is the name of a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] group of maverick [[fine art]]ists from the [[communism|communist]] and postcommunist eras. The original members were Bokros Péter, Molnár Tamás, Csécsei Mihály, Mészáros Bánk, Letenyei József, Sipos Mihály, Kopács Kovács Miklós, and Morva Ibolya. The foundation date of the group is unknown, but as Péter Bokros remembers (in 2005), they started their common activities in 1978, [[Cegléd]], but the name "inconnu" came later.

They  took part in (often illegal) exhibitions and performances in the eighties; and were considered as an important part of the Hungarian democratic opposition both in Hungary and in abroad. From 1979 they were subject to serious manhunt by the Hungarian authorities, and they were continuously followed and eyed by secret agents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galantai.hu/festo/1982/820614.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Post-Communism==
After 1994 some members became active again and continued &amp;ndash; in their words &amp;ndash; their "[[anticommunism|anti-communist]]" drive, now against the (post-communist socialist) governments (led by Hungarian Socialist Party, MSzP).{{fact|date=January 2014}} Other members created independent art and to explore the "rubberized horror of global powers".{{fact|date=January 2014}}

The '''Institute of Human Origins''' (IHO) is a [[non-profit]], multidisciplinary research organization dedicated to the recovery and analysis of the fossil evidence for [[human evolution]]. It was founded by the team of [[Paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] that discovered [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]], and became affiliated with [[Arizona State University]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Institute of Human Origins|url=https://iho.asu.edu/sites/iho-dev.asu.edu/files/iho_newsletter_may_1997.pdf|date=May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, IHO received the single largest grant dedicated to the research of [[Multiregional origin of modern humans|human origins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-09/asu-air091714.php|accessdate=8 April 2016|agency=American Association for the Advancement of Science|title=ASU institute receives single-largest investment in human origins research|publisher=EurekAlert: The Global Source for Science News|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASU institute receives single-largest investment in human origins research|url=https://asunow.asu.edu/content/asu-institute-receives-single-largest-investment-human-origins-research|website=Arizona State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
After finding [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]] during the "surge of discoveries"&lt;ref name="Time Magazine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rothman|first1=Lily|title=How Lucy the Australopithecus Changed the Way We Understand Human Evolution|url=http://time.com/4126011/lucy-australopithecus-discovery/|website=Time|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1970s, [[Donald Johanson]] returned to [[Berkeley, California]] and founded the Institute of Human Origins with the mission of bridging social, earth, and life science approaches to the most important questions concerning the course, causes, and timing of events in the human career over [[deep time]].

==Research and Discoveries==

===The Fossil Record of the Earliest Human Evolution===
[[Ledi-Geraru]] is one of IHO's fieldwork sites in the fossil-rich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Jawbone Could Shake Up Fossil Record|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/07/070713-ancient-jawbones.html|website=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Afar Region]] of Ethiopia. In 2013, graduate student Chalachew Seyoum discovered the lower mandible known as [[LD 350-1]], the oldest fossil from the human genus [[Homo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryn |first1=Brandon |title=Oldest Fossil of Homo Genus Found in Ethiopia |url=http://www.aaas.org/news/science-oldest-fossil-homo-genus-found-ethiopia |website=American Association for the Advancement of Science |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315013228/http://www.aaas.org/news/science-oldest-fossil-homo-genus-found-ethiopia |archivedate=March 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery pushed back evidence of the human genus [[Homo]] to 2.8 million years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovery of 2.8-million-year-old jaw sheds light on early humans Date:|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150304141454.htm|website=Science Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; ago, nearly a half-million years earlier than perviously known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryn |first1=Brandon |title=Oldest Fossil of Homo Genus Found in Ethiopia |url=http://www.aaas.org/news/science-oldest-fossil-homo-genus-found-ethiopia |website=American Association for the Advancement of Science |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315013228/http://www.aaas.org/news/science-oldest-fossil-homo-genus-found-ethiopia |archivedate=March 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing IHO field work in [[Hadar, Ethiopia]], where [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]] was found in 1974, addresses the evolution and ecology of [[Australopithecus]] (3.0–3.4 million years ago) and the origin of Homo and stone-tool making (2.3 million years ago). 
In 2007, the field project opened ASU’s Hadar Field School, which educates American study abroad students in field methods in human origins research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hadar Paleoanthropology Field School|url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~kreed/Classes.htm|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Emergence of Modern Humans in Africa===
Since joining IHO in 2001, [[Curtis Marean]] has directed the organization's [[Pinnacle Point]] fieldwork, which is currently working to produce and integrate a climate, environment, and paleoanthropological sequence for the final stage in human evolution. The focus of the Pinnacle Point excavations has been at [[Pinnacle Point|Cave 13B (PP13B)]], where the fieldwork team has discovered early evidence of [[symbolic behavior]]. In 2009, the examination of worked silcrete stone from [[Pinnacle Point]] indicated that it was heat-treated, and is the oldest known example of such technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hirst|first1=K. Kris|title=Pinnacle Point [PP13B] (South Africa)|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/phthroughpi/g/pinnacle_point.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heat Treatment Makes Better Stone Tools|url=http://www.becominghuman.org/node/news/heat-treatment-makes-better-stone-tools|website=Becoming Human}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinnacle Point also represents the oldest known occurrence of human consumption of [[shellfish]], as well as an early use of [[ochre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marean|first1=Curtis|last2=Bar-Matthews|first2=M|last3=Bernatchez|first3=J|last4=Fisher|first4=E|last5=Goldberg|first5=P|title=Early human use of marine resources and pigment in South Africa during the Middle Pleistocene|journal=Nature|date=2007|volume=449|issue=7164|pages=905-U11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features indicate a sophisticated level of modern behaviors that had previously been associated with Upper Paleolithic of Europe. The discoveries here are key pieces of evidence supporting the early florescence of modern human behaviors in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hirst|first1=K. Kris|title=Pinnacle Point [PP13B] (South Africa)|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/phthroughpi/g/pinnacle_point.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Evolutionary Foundations of Human Uniqueness===
The IHO Templeton Research Program is a collaborative inquiry into the evolutionary foundations of human uniqueness. The $4.9 million, three-year grant from the [[John Templeton Foundation]] is the largest of its type for human origins research, and will support 11 linked investigations of where, when, and how unique human capacities for complex cognition, cumulative culture, and large-scale cooperation emerged.&lt;ref name="IHO Templeton Research Program"&gt;{{cite web|title=IHO Templeton Research Program|url=https://iho.asu.edu/research/iho-templeton-research-program|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Fiqh |hygiene}}

'''Islamic toilet etiquette''' describes the rules that the [[Islam]]ic faith has regarding personal [[hygiene]] when going to the [[toilet]]. This code of [[Muslim hygienical jurisprudence]] is known as ''Qadaa' al-Haajah''. 

The only issue which the [[Qur'an]] mentions is the one of washing one's hands ([[s:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/5. The Food#5:6|verse 5:6]]). Issues of [[chirality]] (bodily symmetry), such as whether one uses the left or right hand, and which foot is used to step into or out of toilet areas, are derived from [[hadith]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xRqDv90bAqsC |year=1992 |title=The Tao of Islam |isbn=978-0-7914-0913-8 |author=Sachiko Murata |chapter=ch. 3 The Two Hands of God}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==

A Muslim must first find an acceptable place away from standing water, people's pathways, or shade.&lt;ref&gt;Narrated by Abu Hurairah and collected in Sahih Muslim (Book 002, Number 0516&lt;/ref&gt; They are advised that it is better to enter the area with the left foot,&lt;ref name="maalik"&gt;Narrated by Anas bin Malik and collected in Sahih al-Bukhari (Volume 1, Book 4, Number 144) and Sahih Muslim (Book 003, Number 729)&lt;/ref&gt; facing away from the [[Qiblah]] (prayer point).&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;

While on the toilet, one must remain silent. Talking, answering greetings, or greeting others is strongly discouraged.&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt;  When defecating together, two men cannot converse, nor look at each other's genitals.&lt;ref&gt;Sunaan ibn Majah, 1.342&lt;/ref&gt; A man should not touch his genitals with the right hand.&lt;ref&gt;Sunaan Abu Dawud, 1.1.0031&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mishkat, 1.185"&gt;Mishkat, 1.185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mishkat, 1.183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sunaan Nasai, 1.24, 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim, 2.0512&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari, 1.4.156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Whenever anyone of you drinks water, he should not breathe in the drinking utensil, and whenever anyone of you goes to a lavatory, he is advised better to neither touch his penis nor clean his private parts with his right hand." (Sahih Bukhari, 1. 4.155)[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/004.sbt.html#001.004.155] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525070903/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/004.sbt.html|date=2011-05-25}}[http://www.holyebooks.org/islam/hadith_of_bukhari/004.sbt.html#001.004.155]&lt;/ref&gt; Eating any food while on the toilet is strictly forbidden.&lt;ref name="MSA"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.msawest.com/islam/fundamentals/pillars/prayer/prescribed/pp1_2.html |publisher=MSA West Compendium of Muslim Texts |last=Shu'aib |first=Tajuddin B. |work=The Prescribed Prayer Made Simple |title=Qadaahul Haajah (Relieving Oneself) |accessdate=2009-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090819060534/http://www.msawest.com/islam/fundamentals/pillars/prayer/prescribed/pp1_2.html |archivedate=2009-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[anal cleansing|anus must be washed with water]] after [[defecating]]. Similarly, the [[penis]] and [[vulva]] must be washed with water after urinating. This washing is known as ''[[istinja]]''. The Qur'an suggests that one should wash one's hands as well, which is discussed in [[s:The Holy Qur'an (Maulana Muhammad Ali)/5. The Food#5:6|verse 5:6]].

When leaving the toilet, one is advised to leave with the right foot,&lt;ref name="maalik"/&gt; and also say a prayer – "Praise be to Allah who relieved me of the filth and gave me relief."&lt;ref name="MSA"/&gt; It is also reported in the hadith of [[Muhammad al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] that whenever Muhammad went to the toilet, he said "In the name of [[Allah]], O Allah! I seek refuge with You from all offensive and wicked things" (alternate translation: "from evil deeds and evil spirits").&lt;ref&gt;Hadith of Bukhari: Volumes I, II, III &amp; IV. 1944. P.39. Hadith 1:144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Israel Meteorological Service''' ({{lang-he|השירות המטאורולוגי הישראלי}}, ''HaSherut HaMete'orologi HaYisra'eli'') is a unit of the Israeli Ministry of Transportation that is responsible for forecasting weather, meteorological data supply and climate research in Israel. Its origins begin in 1930's in a meteorological unit established by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] government mainly as a support to the evolving aviation needs at the time. After establishment of the state of Israel, it was incorporated into the newly established ministry of transport. It is a member of the [[World Meteorological Organization]] since 1949. the Israeli Meteorological Service runs more than 150 measuring stations across Israel. Located between [[Rishon LeZion]], [[Mishmar HaShiva]], and [[Holon]], it is traditionally identified with also nearby [[Beit Dagan]].

The '''Jackson School of Geosciences''' at [[The University of Texas at Austin]] unites the '''Department of Geological Sciences''' with two research units, the '''Institute for Geophysics''' and the '''Bureau of Economic Geology'''.

The Jackson School is both old and new.

{{anchor|Bureau of Economic Geology}}
'''Bureau of Economic Geology'''

The Bureau of Economic Geology was established in 1909 as a successor to the Texas Geological Survey and the Texas Mineral Survey. Dr. William Battle Phillips was the Bureau's first director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beg.utexas.edu/100/db_phillips.htm William Battle Phillips – Bureau of Economic Geology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217191659/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/100/db_phillips.htm |date=2013-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fph09  PHILLIPS, WILLIAM BATTLE | The Handbook of Texas Online | Texas State Historical Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1909 the Texas legislature established and funded three Texas Geological Surveys, which lasted from 1858–1867 (with a four-year suspension), 1873–1876, and 1888–1901 (with the last five years unfunded).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/szg02 GEOLOGICAL SURVEYS OF TEXAS | The Handbook of Texas Online | Texas State Historical Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Today the Bureau functions as a research unit of The University of Texas at Austin, the State Geological Survey, and the Regional Lead Organization for the Petroleum Technology Transfer Council.

[[Image:beg seal transparent.png|125px|right]]

Currently under the leadership of Dr. Scott Tinker,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beg.utexas.edu/Tinker/tinker_about.php Tinker profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113190743/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/Tinker/tinker_about.php |date=2012-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau conducts research in two broad areas: energy and environment.

The Bureau’s energy research focuses largely on oil and natural gas. Major approaches include salt tectonics, carbonate and clastic reservoir characterization, fracture characterization and prediction, multicomponent seismic applications, and basin analysis. The Bureau works to bring insight and innovation from outcrop studies to the evolving science of reservoir characterization. With 70% of in-place reserves typically remaining in the ground at the time of oil field abandonment, this research has enduring economic and societal importance.

The Bureau’s environmental research group conducts a wide range of basic and applied research in groundwater resources, [[vadose zone]] hydrology, coastal studies, near-surface [[geophysics]], and geologic mapping. The group also has programs that relate energy and the environment, including a major initiative in geological sequestration of greenhouse gases. A variety of approaches are used to investigate characteristics and processes of shallow Earth systems and impacts of human activities on those systems. Remote sensing, including satellite (GRACE and MODIS) and airborne geophysics are used to quantify regional scale evapotranspiration, groundwater storage, and saline plume characterization. Subsurface geologic and hydrogeologic characterization provides critical information on sustainability of water resources and potential for [[carbon sequestration]] and desalination. Although many of the studies are focused in Texas, insights and process understanding are applied to other regions globally (such as China, India, Africa, and South America).

The Bureau provides wide-ranging advisory, technical, informational, and research-based services to industries, nonprofit organizations, and Federal, State, and local agencies. The Bureau also provides facilities and management to the office of Publication Sales, Core Research Laboratories, and the Geophysical Log Facility, all of which serve the public.

'''Institute for Geophysics'''

Founded in 1972, the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) is an Organized Research Unit within The University of Texas at Austin, conducting academic research in geology and geophysics.UTIG works with the UT Department of Geological Sciences and Bureau of Economic Geology to provide basic and applied geophysical research opportunities for graduate students at the MA and PhD level through its worldwide programs in solid earth geophysics, marine geology/geophysics, and multi-channel reflection seismology. Some of its scientists also participate in the university's Environmental Science Institute.

[[Image:UTIG-logo.png|150px|right]]UTIG research activities are carried out all over the world and include large-scale, multi-investigator, multi-institutional field programs. The importance of geophysical measurements and their mathematical interpretation in the exploration for petroleum and economically useful minerals has also led to valuable partnerships between UTIG and industry. UTIG plays a role in K-12 education through formal teacher-training programs and informal outreach efforts.

UTIG strives to conduct research that expands the frontiers of knowledge in earth science, has societal and economic relevance, and is of human interest. Dedicated to basic and applied research alike, the Institute aims to enhance humanity's fundamental understanding of the dynamic geophysical processes that have influenced and continue to influence Earth's structure and climate.

Geographically, UTIG's scope includes the ocean basins, continental margins, Antarctica, and all sites of seismic activity. Chronologically, its scope is no less vast: from the development of tectonic evolution models that reconstruct continental arrangements as much as a billion years ago to predicting how future climatic scenarios would impact sea-level changes and thus the habitability of densely populated coastal regions. The Institute's research is highly relevant to natural resource exploration, the assessment of [[geologic hazards]], and the mitigation of environmental damage. The development of new mathematical models, data processing and imaging techniques, and geophysical instrumentation is also an integral part of UTIG's ongoing research and future goals.

'''Department of Geological Sciences'''

[[Image:University of texas at austin department of geological sciences logo.png|165px|right]]Founded in 1888, the Department of Geological Sciences is the main academic unit of the Jackson School. However, scientists and students in the Department do conduct a wide range of research and collaborate with researchers at the Institute and Bureau, as well as with colleagues around the world.

Scientists in the Department conduct research and teach courses in 9 main areas: Atmospheric Sciences, Computational Geosciences, Geochemistry/Thermo- &amp; Geo-chronology, Geophysics/Seismology, Hydrogeology/Glaciology, Paleontology/Geobiology, Petrology/Mineral Physics, Sedimentary Geology/Stratigraphy, Structural Geology/Lithospheric Geodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson School of Geosciences Research Disciplines
http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/research/disciplines/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department houses one of only a handful of non-medical CT scanners at an academic institution anywhere in the world. The High Resolution X-Ray CT (UTCT) Facility has been used to non-destructivley scan precious, one-of-a-kind specimens such as Lucy (an ancient human ancestor and the world's most famous fossil),&lt;ref&gt;Researchers Complete First CT Scan of Ancient Human Ancestor Lucy http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/2009/02/researchers-complete-first-ct-scan-of-ancient-human-ancestor-lucy/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Archaeopteryx'' (one of the oldest and most primitive birds known), one of the first books printed in the New World, and a meteorite thought by some to contain signs of life on Mars. The UTCT is an NSF-supported shared multi-user facility. Data and imagery from the research are freely available online for scientists,  students and the general public via the DigiMorph web site.&lt;ref&gt;High Resolution X-Ray CT Facility http://www.ctlab.geo.utexas.edu/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DigiMorph http://digimorph.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major lab facilities include: Aqueous Geochemistry, Electron Microbeam (EPMA, SEM, ESEM, and XRD), Fission Track Thermochronology, Geomicrobiology, Geophysics (Landmark and Geoquest software for seismic processing and  interpretation), ICP Mass Spectrometry, Isotope Hydrology, Mineral Physics, Paleomagnetics, Petrographic Imaging, Stable Isotope, [[thermal ionization mass spectrometry|Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry]] (TIMS), and U-PB Geochronology.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Geological Sciences Resources and Facilities http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/research/facilities/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Department, in partnership with the Texas Natural Science Center, also maintains two major paleontology collections: the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory (focusing largely on the American Southwest and Texas) and the Non-vertebrate Paleontology Lab.

The '''''Journal of Contemporary Religion''''' is a triannual [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] which covers anthropological, sociological, psychological, and philosophical aspects of religion.

== History and format ==
The journal was established in 1985 as ''Religion Today'' by the Centre for New Religions at [[King's College London]]. Its founding [[editor-in-chief|editor]] was [[Peter B. Clarke]] (later at [[Wolfson College, Oxford]]).&lt;ref&gt;Arweck, Elisabeth. ''Researching new religious movements: responses and redefinitions'', p. ix, Routledge 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-415-27755-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney; Finke, Roger. ''Acts of faith: explaining the human side of religion''. University of California Press 2000, p. 16, {{ISBN|978-0-520-22202-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ClarkeNew&gt;Clarke, Peter Bernard. ''New Religions in Global Perspective: A Study of Religious Change in the Modern World'', Routledge 2006, p. 46, {{ISBN|978-0-415-25748-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal, which changed its name to the current title in 1995,&lt;ref name=ClarkeNew /&gt; is published by [[Routledge]]. Its current editor is [[Elisabeth Arweck]] ([[University of Warwick]]); Peter B. Clarke, who died in June 2011, will remain listed as co-editor until the end of the year out of respect for his contributions to the field.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite journal |title=Peter B. Clarke (1940–2011) |first= Elisabeth |last=Arweck |journal=Journal of Contemporary Religion |volume=26|issue=3 |pages = 353|year=2011 |doi=10.1080/13537903.2011.620796}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=editorialBoard&amp;journalCode=cjcr20 Editorial Board], Taylor and Francis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=THE&gt;[[Julius J. Lipner|Lipner, Julius]] (1997-10-17). [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=159825&amp;sectioncode=26 "Social science &amp; humanities journals: Prayers for today"], ''[[Times Higher Education]]''. Retrieved 2010-06-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

An issue of the triannual journal typically features five or six major articles.&lt;ref name=THE /&gt; Other content includes conference reports, research notes, book reviews and review articles, and articles are sometimes illustrated with graphics or photographs.&lt;ref name=THE /&gt;

== Reception ==
The ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' stated in a 1997 review of the journal that "The contributors are invariably academics, mainly from North America and Europe. The style ranges from the homely, almost chatty at times, to the more formal. The articles, however, are on the whole scholarly and, as advertised, treat of a wide range of subjects, from the [[Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University|Brahma Kumaris]] to [[Sahaja Yoga]], from the '[[Toronto Blessing]]' to the nature of [[fundamentalism]], from 'The Protestant eruption into modern Brazilian politics' to 'Deconfessionalisation in the Netherlands' (in the last three decades or so). There are fieldwork reports, ethnographic accounts, and historical and conceptual studies. The standard of research and analysis is what one would expect from a good academic journal."&lt;ref name=THE /&gt; The review criticised the small number and seemingly arbitrary selection of book reviews, but concluded by stating that "On the whole, then, the journal is a valuable research tool and source of new knowledge for scholars, teachers and others interested in studying the phenomenon of contemporary religion. With nothing really comparable available in the field, it is highly recommended."&lt;ref name=THE /&gt;

== Abstracting and indexing ==
The ''Journal of Contemporary Religion'' is abstracted and indexed in [[Applied Social Sciences Index &amp; Abstracts]], [[British Humanities Index]], [[CSA (database company)|Worldwide Political Science Abstracts]], [[EBSCO Publishing|EBSCOhost]], [[Educational Research Abstracts Online]], [[Multicultural Education Abstracts]], [[New Testament Abstracts]], [[Religious &amp; Theological Abstracts]], [[CSA (database company)#CSA Sociological Abstracts|Sociological Abstracts]], and [[Studies on Women and Gender Abstracts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=abstractingIndexing&amp;journalCode=cjcr20|title=Journal of Contemporary Religion|work=tandfonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{SouthAfrica state}}
The '''Kingdom of Mapungubwe''' (1075–1220) was a pre-colonial state in Southern Africa located at the confluence of the [[Shashe River|Shashe]] and [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] rivers, south of [[Great Zimbabwe]]. The name is derived from either Venda or Shona. The name may mean "Hill of Jackals".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sahistory.org.za/article/mapungubwe&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom was the first stage in a development that would culminate in the creation of the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]] in the 13th century, and with gold trading links to [[Rhapta]] and [[Kilwa Kisiwani]] on the African east coast. The Kingdom of Mapungubwe lasted about 80 years, and at its height its population was about 5000 people. The Mapungubwe Collection is a museum collection of artifacts found at the archaeological site and is housed in the [[Mapungubwe Museum]] in [[Pretoria]].

This archaeological site can be attributed to the Bukalanga Kingdom, which comprises the [[Kalanga people|Bakalanga people]] from northeast Botswana, the Karanga from Western Zimbabwe, the Vha Venda in the northeast of South Africa. They were the first Bantu to cross the Limpopo River to the south, and established their kingdom where the Shashe and Limpopo conjoined (Sha-limpo).
[[File:MapungubweHill.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|none|Mapungubwe Hill]]

==Origin==
The largest settlement from what has been dubbed the [[Leopard's Kopje]] culture is known as K2 culture and was the immediate predecessor to the settlement of Mapungubwe.&lt;ref&gt;Hrbek, page 322&lt;/ref&gt; The people from K2 culture, probably derived from the ancestral [[Khoi]] culture, were attracted to the Shashi-Limpopo area, likely because it provided mixed agricultural possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Hrbek, page 323&lt;/ref&gt; The area was also prime elephant country, providing access to valuable ivory. The control of the gold and [[ivory trade]] greatly increased the political power of the K2 culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hrbek, page 326&lt;/ref&gt; By 1075, the population of K2 had outgrown the area and relocated to Mapungubwe Hill.&lt;ref name="Hrbek, page 324"&gt;Hrbek, page 324&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stone masonry==
Spatial organisation in the kingdom of Mapungubwe involved the use of stone walls to demarcate important areas for the first time. There was a stone-walled residence likely occupied by the principal councillor.&lt;ref name="Hrbek, page 325"&gt;Hrbek, page 325&lt;/ref&gt; Stone and wood were used together. There would have also been a wooden palisade surrounding Mapungubwe Hill. Most of the capital's population would have lived inside the western wall.&lt;ref name="Hrbek, page 325"/&gt;

==Origins of the name==
[[file:Bateleur Eagle with Kill.jpg|thumb|right|The name may derive from the Shona word for [[Bateleur eagle]]]]
The capital of the kingdom was called Mapungubwe, which is where the kingdom gets its name.&lt;ref name="Hrbek, page 324"/&gt; The site of the city is now a [[World Heritage Site]], [[National heritage sites (South Africa)|South African National Heritage Site]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=9/2/240/0001 - Mapungubwe Archaeological Site, Greefswald, Messina District |url=http://www.sahra.org.za/content/922400001 |publisher=[[South African Heritage Resources Agency]] |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819081731/http://www.sahra.org.za/content/922400001 |archivedate=19 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[national park]], and archaeological site. There is controversy regarding the origin and meaning of the name ''Mapungubwe''. Conventional wisdom has it that Mapungubwe means "place of Jackals," or alternatively, "place where Jackals eat", thavha ya dzi phunguhwe, or, according to Fouché—one of the earliest excavators of Mapungubwe—"hill of the jackals" (Fouché, 1937 p.&amp;nbsp;1). It also means "place of wisdom" and "the place where the rock turns into liquid"—from various ethnicities in the region including the Pedi, Sotho, Venda and Shona.

In [[Shona language|Shona]], the language spoken in Zimbabwe, the word ''mapungu'' is the plural form of the word ''chapungu'', denoting the [[bateleur]] eagle, which is widely believed to be the model for the Zimbabwean birds that once graced the massive Great Zimbabwe royal complex. The ending "bwe" is a diminutive of the word "ibwe,"  which means stone or rock in Shona language. Mapungubwe, in this respect, means the 'rocks of the bateleur eagles'—an indication that there were many bateleurs in the area or location. Chapungu Village in [[Harare]], Zimbabwe's capital, which showcases the country's arts and sculpture traditions, is a tribute to the spirit of the bateleur, a bird which has deep religious connotations in Shona culture.The word Mapungubwe may also have originated from the Shona word ''mhungu'' which means ''black mamba'', the plural of mhungu is ''mapungu''. Mapungubwe is then a diminutive for ''ibwe re mapungu'' which refers to a rocky area where the black mamba snakes are a common sight. It is not uncommon practice in Zimbabwe to shorten phrases with a solid word as is the case with the name Zimbabwe itself which was diminished from ''dzimba dzemabwe''(house of stone), Great Zimbabwe. These rocky places are found throughout Zimbabwe, in Chikomba district under Chief Chandiwana there exists one of the imposing rocky plateaus called Maringobwe which refers to ''ibwe remaringo''. Kuringa is a verb which means ''to look'' in the Zezuru dialect of the Shona people. This suggests the elevated place may have been used for surveillance of the surrounding areas, numerous rock paintings credited to the nomadic hunter gatherer bushmen or ''Khoisan'' who roamed the area before ''Bantu'' migration are a common sight.

==Culture and society==
Mapungubwean society is thought by archaeologists to be the first class-based social system in southern Africa; that is, its leaders were separated from and higher in rank than its inhabitants. Thovhele Shiriyadenga Nemapungubwe was the king (Thovhele in Venda) of Mapungubwe. He later divided his state into districts that were then given and ruled by his children who then became Paramount Chiefs, who had to report to the king himself. Mapungubwe's architecture and spatial arrangement also provide "the earliest evidence for sacred leadership in southern Africa".&lt;ref name="web.wits.ac.za"&gt;[http://web.wits.ac.za/nr/rdonlyres/33e48eb0-29e9-49ec-a296-5daaa4aacc5a/0/evolution.pdf Origin of Species and Evolution, Wits University Showcase]&lt;/ref&gt;

Life in Mapungubwe was centred on family and farming. Special sites were created for initiation ceremonies, household activities, and other social functions. Cattle lived in [[kraal]]s located close to the residents' houses, signifying their value.

Most speculation about society continues to be based upon the remains of buildings, since the Mapungubweans left no written record.

The kingdom was likely divided into a three-tiered hierarchy with the commoners inhabiting low-lying sites, district leaders occupying small hilltops, and the capital at Mapungubwe hill as the supreme authority.&lt;ref name="Hrbek, page 325"/&gt;  
Elites within the kingdom were buried in hills. Royal wives lived in their own area away from the king. Important men maintained prestigious homes on the outskirts of the capital. This type of spatial division occurred first at Mapungubwe but would be replicated in later [[Kingdom of Butua|Butua]] and [[Rozwi]] states.&lt;ref name="Hrbek, page 324"/&gt; The growth in population at Mapungubwe may have led to full-time specialists in ceramics, specifically pottery. Gold objects were uncovered in elite burials on the royal hill (Mapungubwe hill).&lt;ref name="Hrbek, page 325"/&gt;

==Re-discovery==
On New Year's Eve 1932, ESJ&amp;nbsp;van Graan, a local farmer and prospector, and his son, a former student of the [[University of Pretoria]], set out to follow up on a legend he had heard about.

According to an article published in 1985, translated from the Afrikaans text: Remains of a Rock Fort located on top of the hill were under investigation, dated back to the 11th century. The Archeological site is closed to the public, except for supervised visits and tours. However some of the items discovered were on display at the Department of Archeology, at the University of Pretoria. Mapungubwe Hill and K2 were declared national monuments in the 1980s by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanparks.org/parks/mapungubwe/tourism/progress.php |title=Mapungubwe National Park and World Heritage Site: History of the Park |publisher=SANParks |accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two years later Muhammad Muaaz Vawda discovered a grave.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Burials at Mapungubwe Hill==
At least twenty four skeletons were unearthed on Mapungubwe hill but only eleven were available for analysis, with the rest disintegrating upon touch or as soon as they were exposed to light and air. Most of the skeletal remains were buried with few or no accessories with most adults buried with glass beads. Two adult burials (labeled numbers 10 and 14 by the early excavators) as well as one unlabelled skeleton (referred to as the original gold burial)&lt;ref&gt;A. Duffey 2012. Mapungubwe: Interpretation of the Gold Content of the Original Gold Burial M1, A620. [http://www.african-archaeology.de/index.php?page_id=154&amp;journal_id=33&amp;pdf_id=262 Journal of African Archaeology 10 (2), 2012, pages 175–187.]&lt;/ref&gt; were associated with gold artefacts and were unearthed from the so-called grave area upon Mapungubwe hill. Recent genetic studies found these first two skeletons to be of Khoi/San descent and thought to be a king and queen of Mapungubwe{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}. Despite this latest information the remains were all buried in the traditional Bantu burial position (sitting with legs drawn to the chest, arms folded round the front of the knees) and they were facing west. The Skeleton numbered 10, a male, was buried with his hand grasping the golden Scepter.

The skeleton labelled number 14 (female) was buried with at least 100 gold wire bangles around her ankles and there were at least one thousand gold beads in her grave. The last gold burial (male), who was most probably the King, was buried with a headrest and three objects made of gold foil tacked onto a wooden core, depicting a bowl, scepter and rhino. At least two more rhino were in the sample, but their association with a specific grave is unknown.

In 2007, the South African Government gave the green light for the skeletal remains that were excavated back in 1933 to be reburied on Mapungubwe hill in a ceremony that took place on 20 November 2007.

The Mapungubwe Landscape was declared a World Heritage Site on 3 July 2003.

*[[Wastewater engineering]], Wastewater engineering is a type of engineering that comes from civil engineering and environmental engineering. A wastewater engineer determines the best way to transport or collect rainwater for human populations. Wastewater engineering also deals with the transportation and cleaning of [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], [[greywater]] and [[irrigation]] water. Wastewater treatment and water reclamation are areas of concern in this field. Wastewater engineers map out topographical and geographical features of Earth to determine the best means of collection. They use sonar scanning in wells to determine volumes of water that can be used for human consumption. Using these types of data they are able to provide a means of collecting water. After collecting the water, it is their job to transport it to where it can be made available for use.

|-
| [[Mining engineering]]
| An engineering discipline that involves the science, technology and practice of extracting and processing minerals from a naturally occurring environment. Mining engineering is closely related to many other disciplines like mineral processing and metallurgy, geotechnical engineering and surveying. A mining engineer manages all phases of mining operations – from exploration and discovery of the mineral resource, through feasibility studies, mine design, development of plans, production and operations, to mine closure.

With the process of mineral extraction some amount of waste material and other byproducts are generated which are the primary source of pollution in the vicinity of mines. Mining activities by their nature cause a disturbance of the natural environment in and around which the minerals are located. Mining engineers must therefore be concerned not only with the production and processing of mineral commodities, but also with the mitigation of damage to the environment both during and after mining as a result of the change in the mining area.

|[[Project engineering]]
|Project engineering includes all parts of the design of manufacturing or processing facilities, either new or modifications to and expansions of existing facilities. A "project" consists of a coordinated series of activities or tasks performed by engineers and designers.  A small project may be under the direction of a project engineer. Large projects are typically under the direction of a project manager or management team.  Project tasks typically consist of such things as  performing calculations, writing specifications, preparing bids, reviewing equipment proposals and evaluating or selecting equipment and developing and maintaining various lists (equipment and materials lists) and drawings (electrical, instrument and piping schematics, physical layouts and other drawings used in construction).  Some facilities have in house staff to handle small projects, while some major companies have a department that does internal project engineering. Large projects are typically contracted out to project engineering companies.  Staffing at engineering companies varies according to the work load and duration of employment may only last until an individual's tasks are completed.

A '''metal hose''' is a flexible metal line element. There are two basic types of metal hose that differ in their design and application: stripwound hoses and corrugated hoses. Stripwound hoses have a high mechanical strength (e.g. [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]] and tear strength). Corrugated hoses can withstand high pressure and provide maximum leak tightness on account of their material. Corrugated hoses also exhibit [[Corrosion#Resistance to corrosion|corrosion resistance]] and pressure tightness under the most extreme conditions, such as in aggressive [[seawater]] or at extreme temperatures such as found in space or when transporting cooled liquid gas. They are particularly well suited for conveying hot and cold substances.

With a history of more than one hundred years, metal hoses have given rise to other flexible line elements, including metal [[expansion joint]]s, metal [[bellows]] and semi-flexible and flexible metal pipes. In [[Germany]] alone, there are about 3500 patents relating to metal hoses.

==The origins==
[[File:HU-Schlauchprofil.jpg|frameless|left|HU Schlauchprofil ca. 1909]]
The first metal hose was technically a stripwound hose. It was invented in 1885 by the jewellery manufacturer Heinrich Witzenmann (1829–1906) of [[Pforzheim]], Germany, together with the French engineer Eugène Levavassèur. The hose was modelled after the goose throat necklace, a piece of jewellery that consisted of interlacing metal strips. The original design of the hose was based on a [[Helix|helically]] coiled metal strip with an S-shaped profile. The profile interlocked along the windings of the helical coil. Due to a cavity between the interlocking profiles, this did not create a tight fit. The cavity was sealed by means of a [[Natural rubber|rubber]] thread.

|- style="font-size: 86%;"
| valign="top"|[[File:Schlauchprospekt 1911.jpg|165px]]&lt;br /&gt;the first metal hose brochure
|}

The result was a permanently flexible, leak-tight steel body of any length and diameter with a high mechanical strength. In France it was patented on 4 August 1885 with the patent number 170 479, and in Germany on 27 August 1885 with the German Reichspatent No. 34 871.

From 1886 to 1905, Heinrich Witzenmann continued to develop numerous noteworthy profiles for hose production which are still of technical significance today. In 1894, he registered a patent for the double metal hose consisting of two coaxial metal hoses twisted in opposite directions. Further modifications of the original form focused on the use of different hose materials and different substances for the thread seal, including rubber, textile threads, [[asbestos]] and wire.

An important variant of the metal hose can be attributed to the inventor Siegfried Frank of Frankfurt, Germany. In 1894, he patented the method of rolling a helical corrugation into a smooth rigid pipe. Heinrich Witzenmann had already made experiments in this direction several years earlier, but did not continue his efforts to create a patentable result. It wasn't until the twenties and thirties of the 20th century that the hotel administrator Albert Dreyer of Lucerne, Switzerland, succeeded in creating a satisfactory annular corrugation for the manufacture of metal corrugated hoses.

=== Continued development ===
Emil Witzenmann, son of Heinrich Witzenmann, developed a form of the metal hose in 1909 that eliminated the need for any kind of sealing thread, be it of rubber, textile fibre or asbestos. In this type of hose, the strip edges do not interlock but abut each other and are seamlessly [[Welding|welded]] together. In 1920, Emil Witzenmann invented the [[metal expansion joint]]. This invention was based on the double-walled, welded, corrugated metal hose (with a wound protection sheath) with radial flexibility. In 1929, it became possible for the first time to produce metal bellows. These were also developed by Albert Dreyer of [[Lucerne]], but independently of Witzenmann.

Metal bellows are created by rolling annular corrugations into a smooth extruded or welded pipe. In 1946, Albert Dreyer developed a multi-walled joint that was designed to accommodate axial movements as well: the [[Metal expansion joint#Axial|axial expansion joint]].

== The stripwound hose ==
Stripwound hoses consist of [[spiral]]s that are loosely interlocked. This causes them to be highly flexible. These hoses come in two basic variants – either with an engaged profile or with an interlocked profile such as the Agraff profile. Both variants offer high flexibility due to the profile structure. However, this results in their not being fully leak-tight. For this reason, they are often used as insulating or protective hoses around an inner tube.
{| style="float: right; border: 1px solid #BBB; margin: .46em 0 0 .2em;"
|- style="font-size: 86%;"
| valign="top"|[[File:Wickelschlauch Übersicht.jpg|650px]]
|}

=== Structure and function ===
Stripwound hoses are created by helically winding cold-rolled, profiled metal strip onto a [[mandrel]] where the helical coils are interconnected but remain movable due to the type of profiling. This principle of a movable connection between the profiled coils leads to the high flexibility and movability of metal stripwound hoses. Most strips are made of [[galvanized steel]], [[stainless steel]] or [[brass]], which can optionally be chromium- or nickel-plated.

=== Properties of stripwound hoses ===
Stripwound hoses exhibit enormous tensile and transversal pressure resistance, a high [[Strain (chemistry)#Torsional strain|torsional strength]] and excellent chemical and thermal stability. Due to their structure, they are not 100% leak-tight.

=== Types of stripwound hose ===
The metal hose properties are determined by several factors: the profile shape, the strip dimensions, the material and, if applicable, the type of [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]].

Stripwound hoses are available with round and polygonal cross-sections.

[[Automotive engineering]] most often uses metallically sealed stripwound hoses. The introduction of a cotton, rubber or ceramic sealing thread into a specially profiled chamber during the winding process leads to greater tightness. For maximum tightness, the stripwound hoses can also be sheathed in [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] or [[silicone]]. The profile shapes range from simple engaged profiles to highly secure Agraff profiles.

=== Application areas for stripwound hoses ===
Stripwound hoses are frequently used as flexible temperature-resistant and ageing-resistant elements in exhaust equipment, especially in trucks and special vehicles such as [[tractor]]s. They are also used as protective hoses for light conductors and electrical lines in [[Optical fiber|fibre optics]], or in measuring and control equipment. As miniature hoses with diameters ranging from 2.0–0.3&amp;nbsp;mm, they are also employed in medical technology, such as for [[endoscopy]].

In addition, stripwound hoses are used for extracting and conveying substances such as smoke, shavings, granulate, etc. They are also suitable as protective hoses for corrugated lines to prevent over-extension and to act as a liner (guide hose inside a corrugated hose) to optimise [[flow conditions]].

Stripwound metal hoses also include "bendable arms", or "swan necks". These consist of a round wire coil over which a triangular wire is wound. They can be bent in any direction and remain stationary in any position. These are used for the flexible supports of lamps, magnifying glasses and microphones, for example.

== The corrugated hose ==
[[File:Wellschlauch Profilzeichnung.jpg|frameless|left|Profilzeichnung eines Wellschlauches]]
Corrugated hoses are pressure and vacuum tight. The permissible operating pressures for hoses with small dimensions reach 380&amp;nbsp;bar (with a 3-fold burst pressure safety factor). The pressure resistance of large dimensions is lower for technical reasons. Stainless steel models have a temperature resistance of up to approx. 600&amp;nbsp;°C, depending on the pressure load, and even higher values are possible with special materials. In the low temperature range, stainless steel corrugated hoses can be used down to -270&amp;nbsp;°C.

=== Structure and function ===
Corrugated hoses are used as economical, flexible connecting elements that permit movement, [[thermal expansion]] and vibrations, and that can be used as filling hoses. The starting material is a seamless or longitudinally welded, thin-walled tube into which corrugations are introduced by mechanical or hydraulic means using special tools. Corrugated hoses are absolutely leak-tight and are used to convey liquids or gases under pressure or as vacuum lines. They are also referred to as pressure hoses. Their special design achieves both flexibility and pressure resistance.

=== Types of corrugated hose ===
There are two basic variants of corrugated hoses that differ in their type of corrugation: annular corrugation and helical corrugation. In hoses with helical corrugation, usually a right-handed coil with a constant [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|pitch]] that runs along the whole length of the hose.
The annular corrugation, on the other hand, consists of a large number of equally-spaced parallel corrugations whose main plane is [[perpendicular]] to the hose axis. Hoses with annular corrugation have decided advantages over those with helical corrugation:
* When installed properly, they are free of damaging torsional strain during pressure surges.
* Because of the shape of their profile, they connect smoothly to connection fittings.

This increases process reliability during conduit assembly and use. For this reason, annular corrugated hoses are far more common, with only a few exceptions.

=== Manufacturing corrugated hoses ===
The first step in creating a corrugated hose is to shape the starting metal strip from the coil into a smooth, longitudinally welded tube. The strip is continuously welded using the highly precise shielding gas welding method. Then the tube is corrugated by one of the following procedures:
* The hydraulic corrugation method expands the tube from the inside to the outside. This method is used to create annular corrugated hoses.
* The mechanical corrugation method, on the other hand, is used to produce both annular and helical corrugated hoses. Usually, multiple profiled pressure rollers are positioned around the tube with an offset that enables them to roll the desired corrugation profile into the tube from the outside to the inside. Both corrugation methods cause material hardening and thus increase the pressure and fatigue resistance of the corrugated hoses.

In addition, corrugated hoses can be manufactured by a special method that is closely related to the manufacture of stripwound hoses. In this procedure, the starting strip is given a corrugated profile in a longitudinal direction. This profile strip is then wound helically and the overlapping coils are tightly welded along the helical seam. After corrugation, the hose may be equipped with a braided sheath (see below). In this case, the hose then passes through a braiding machine that has circumferential wire coil holders, or so-called bobbins.
{| style="float: right; border: 1px solid #BBB; margin: .46em 0 0 .2em;"
|- style="font-size: 86%;"
| valign="top"|[[File:Metallschläuche.jpg|180px]]&lt;br /&gt;metal hoses with different connections
|}

The wire bundles are wrapped helically around the hose while also being alternately layered one over the other. This creates a tubular braid with the characteristic crisscross pattern. After the fittings are mounted, the hose line is complete. Production-related testing is an integral part of the manufacturing process. It encompasses incoming tests of the starting material as well as dimensional, leakage and pressure testing of the finished conduit.

=== Flexibility ===
The [[Flexibility (engineering)|flexibility]] of the hose is achieved by means of the elastic behaviour of the corrugation profile. When the hose is bent, the outer corrugations separate while the inner corrugations are squeezed together. The flexibility, bending behaviour and pressure stability of corrugated hoses depend on the selected profile shape. While flexibility increases with an increase in profile height and a decrease in corrugation spacing, pressure resistance decreases. The frequently required semi-flexible bending behaviour is achieved by flat profiles. Depending on the use of the hose, special application-specific profile shapes can be implemented

{| style="float: right; border: 1px solid #BBB; margin: .46em 0 0 .2em;"
|- style="font-size: 86%;"
| valign="top"|[[File:Miniaturschläuche.jpg|180px]]&lt;br /&gt;miniature metal hoses for medical or optoelectronical applications
|}
Pressure resistance and flexibility can also be altered by varying the wall thickness. A reduction in the wall thickness increases the bending capacity but reduces the pressure resistance of the hose.

== Special designs ==
Miniature hoses with a diameter of only a few millimetres are highly flexible while also being very robust. When provided with a special sheathing, they can be used in minimally invasive [[surgery]]. Models with an inner liner (see below) and special connectors are used for laser or optoelectronic applications. The smallest diameter for miniature hoses is 1.8&amp;nbsp;mm.

With its ability to meet high demands for conveying hot and cold substances, this modern technology has the following major areas of application:
* Electrical industry and [[mechanical engineering]]: as a protective hose for electrical cables or light conductors
* As a suction, conveying and coolant hose, e.g. when conveying and transporting liquid gas
* [[Automotive industry]]: as an exhaust gas hose that acts as a vibration decoupler in exhaust systems
* As a ventilation hose in technical building equipment
* [[Steel#Steel industry|Steel industry]]
* Measuring and control equipment
* Medical equipment
* Aviation and space travel
* Reactor technology
* [[Alternative energy]] (solar heat, wind turbines, etc.)

== Properties of metal hoses ==
Metal hoses resist high pressures and offer maximum tightness on account of the material from which they are manufactured. Their flexibility lends them tensile and tear strength. Also, they are characterised by their corrosion and pressure resistance, even under extreme conditions such as when exposed to aggressive seawater, strong vibrations and extreme temperatures such as in space or when transporting cooled liquid gas.

== Braiding around metal hoses ==
[[File:Schlauchleitung fz.jpg|thumb|upright|&lt;br /&gt;braided conduit for motion decoupling in vehicle exhaust systems]]

To increase pressure resistance, metal hoses can be equipped with one- or two-layer braiding. The braiding is firmly connected to the hose fittings on both sides to absorb the longitudinal forces caused by internal pressure. Due to its inherent flexibility, the braid moulds itself perfectly to the movement of the hose. Hose braiding consists of right- and left-handed wrapped wire bundles that are alternately layered one over the other. This not only prevents hose lengthening due to internal pressure, but also absorbs external tensile forces and protects the outside of the hose. The basic material of the wire braid is usually the same as that of the corrugated hose. It is also possible to select different materials in the interest of greater corrosion resistance or for economic considerations.

The braiding also greatly increases the resistance of the hose to internal pressure. The braid flexibly moulds itself to the movement of the hose. This applies even if a second braiding is used, which further increases pressure resistance. The method by which the braiding is attached to the connection fittings depends on the type of fitting and the demands on the hose. Under rough operating conditions, an additional round wire coil can be wound over the braid or the braid can be sheathed in a protective hose.

=== Functional principle of the metal braid ===
Wire braiding functions on the lazy tongs principle. When axial tension is applied to the hose, the braid reaches its extension limit. This means that the wires lie tightly spaced with the smallest crossing angle, creating a hose braiding of the smallest possible diameter and the largest possible length. When the hose is axially compressed, the crossing angle and diameter increase to maximum values.

MRC-compressed images are typically packaged into a hybrid file format such as [[PDF]]. This allows for multiple images, and the instructions to properly render and reassemble them, to be stored within a single file.

The '''modius''' is a type of flat-topped cylindrical headdress or crown found in [[ancient Egyptian art]] and art of the [[Greco-Roman world]]. The name was given by modern scholars based on its resemblance to the jar used as a [[ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman unit of dry measure]],&lt;ref&gt;Judith Lynn Sebesta and [[Larissa Bonfante]], ''The World of Roman Costume'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2001), p. 245; Irene Bald Romano, ''Classical Sculpture: Catalogue of the Cypriot, Greek, And Roman Stone Sculpture in the University Of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology'' (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology, 2006), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; but it probably does represent a grain-measure, and symbolized powers over fecundity in those wearing it.

The modius is worn by certain deities, including [[Mut]],&lt;ref&gt;Betsy M. Bryan, "A Newly Discovered Statue of a Queen from the Reign of Amenhotep III," in ''Servant of Mut: Studies in Honor of Richard A. Fazzini'' (Brill, 2007), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleusinian mysteries|Eleusinian deities]] and their Roman counterparts, the [[Artemis of Ephesus|Ephesian Artemis]] and certain other forms of the goddess,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Eddy Fontenrose, ''Didyma: Apollo's Oracle, Cult, and Companions'' pp. 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hecate]], and [[Serapis]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, ''Hellenistic Sculpture: The Styles of ca. 331–200 B.C.'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2001), p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; On some deities it represents fruitfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Fontenrose, ''Didyma'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought to be a form mostly restricted to supernatural beings in art, and by rarely worn in real life, with two probable exceptions.  A tall modius is part of the complex headdress used for portraits of Egyptian queens, ornamented variously with symbols, vegetative motifs, and the [[uraeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, "A Newly Discovered Statue of a Queen," p 36ff.; Paul Edmund Stanwick, ''Portraits of the Ptolemies: Greek Kings As Egyptian Pharaohs'' (University of Texas Press, 2002), p. 35 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the distinctive headdress of [[Palmyra|Palmyrene]] priests.&lt;ref&gt;Romano, ''Classical Sculpture,'' p. 294; Lucinda Dirven, ''The Palmyrenes of Dura-Europos: A Study of Religious Interaction in Roman Syria'' (Brill, 1999), pp. 246–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO)''' is a [[Federally Funded Research and Development Center]] of the [[United States]] [[National Science Foundation]] operated under cooperative agreement by [[Associated Universities, Inc]] for the purpose of [[radio astronomy]].  NRAO designs, builds, and operates its own high sensitivity [[radio telescope]]s for use by scientists around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrao.edu/index.php/about About the NRAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==

===Charlottesville, Virginia===
The NRAO headquarters is located on the campus of the [[University of Virginia]]. The North American [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] Science Center and the NRAO Technology Center are also located in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrao.edu/directions/cville/ Charlottesville NRAO Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green Bank, West Virginia===
[[File:300ft after hi.tif|thumb|left|The 300ft telescope after collapsing in 1988]]
[[File:GBT.png|thumb|left|The 100 meter [[Green Bank Telescope]].]]
NRAO was, until October 2016, the operator of the world's largest fully steerable [[radio telescope]], the Robert C. Byrd [[Green Bank Telescope]], which stands near [[Green Bank, West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aui.edu/news/nrao-structural-changes-announcing-the-separation-of-the-green-bank-observatory-and-the-long-baseline-observatory/&lt;/ref&gt; The observatory contains several other telescopes, among them the {{convert|140|ft|m|adj=on}} telescope that utilizes an [[equatorial mount]] uncommon for radio telescopes, three {{convert|85|ft|m|adj=on}} telescopes forming the [[Green Bank Interferometer]], a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} telescope used by school groups and organizations for small scale research, a fixed radio '[[horn (telescope)|horn]]' built to observe the radio source Cassiopeia A, as well as a reproduction of the original antenna built by [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]] while he worked for Bell Labs to detect the [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]] that was discovered to be previously unknown natural [[radio waves]] emitted by the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gb.nrao.edu/othertelescopes.shtml Other Telescopes at NRAO Green Bank, West Virginia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Bank is in the [[United States National Radio Quiet Zone]], which is coordinated by NRAO for protection of the Green Bank site as well as the [[Sugar Grove, West Virginia]] monitoring site operated by the [[National Security Agency|NSA]].  The zone consists of a {{convert|13000|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} piece of land where fixed transmitters must coordinate their emissions before a license is granted.  The land was set aside by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in 1958.  No fixed radio transmitters are allowed within the area closest to the telescope.  All other fixed radio transmitters including TV and radio towers inside the zone are required to transmit such that interference at the antennas is minimized by methods including limited power and using highly directional antennas.  With the advent of [[wireless]] technology and microprocessors in everything from cameras to cars, it is difficult to keep the sites free of radio interference.  To aid in limiting outside interference, the area surrounding the Green Bank observatory was at one time planted with pines characterized by needles of a certain length to block electromagnetic interference at the wavelengths used by the observatory.  At one point, the observatory faced the problem of [[New World flying squirrel|North American flying squirrels]] tagged with [[US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service]] telemetry transmitters.  Electric fences, electric blankets, faulty automobile electronics, and other radio wave emitters have caused great trouble for the astronomers in Green Bank.  All vehicles on the premises are powered by diesel motors to minimize interference by ignition systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gb.nrao.edu/nrqz/nrqz.shtml The National Radio Quiet Zone]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gb.nrao.edu/visitors/TheEnemyIsUs.pdf NRAO Green Bank Site RFI Regulations for Visitors.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socorro, New Mexico===
[[File:USA.NM.VeryLargeArray.02.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Very Large Array]] (VLA), an interferometer consisting of 27 dishes.]]
The NRAO's facility in Socorro is the Pete V. Domenici [[Array Operations Center]] (AOC). Located on the [[New Mexico Tech]] university campus, the AOC serves as the headquarters for the [[Very Large Array]] (VLA), which was the setting for the [[1997 in film|1997]] movie ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'', and is also the control center for the [[Very Long Baseline Array]] (VLBA). The ten VLBA telescopes are located in [[Hawaii]], the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], and eight other sites across the continental United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/ Socorro, New Mexico NRAO Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tucson, Arizona===
Offices are located on the [[University of Arizona]] campus.  NRAO formerly operated the [[ARO 12m Radio Telescope|12 Meter Telescope]] on [[Kitt Peak]].  NRAO suspended operations at this telescope and funding was rerouted to the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuc.nrao.edu/ Tucson, Arizon NRAO Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Arizona Radio Observatory]] now operates the 12 Meter Telescope.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aro.as.arizona.edu/ Arizona Radio Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Santiago, Chile===
The [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) site in Chile is at ~5000 m (~16,500&amp;nbsp;ft) altitude near [[Cerro Chajnantor]] in northern Chile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almaobservatory.org/ ALMA]&lt;/ref&gt; This is about 40&amp;nbsp;km (about 25 miles) east of the historic village of [[San Pedro de Atacama]], 130&amp;nbsp;km (about 80 miles) southeast of the mining town of Calama, and about 275&amp;nbsp;km (about 170 miles) east-northeast of the coastal port of [[Antofagasta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/about-alma/location ALMA Location]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wide image|Halfway There - 33 ALMA Antennas on Chajnantor.jpg|799px|On 12 May 2012, another Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) antenna was carried up to the 5000-metre plateau of Chajnantor, bringing the total on the plateau to 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Halfway There: 33 ALMA Antennas on Chajnantor|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann12035/|accessdate=15 May 2012|newspaper=ESO Announcement}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Jansky Prize==

The [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl G. Jansky]] Lectureship is a prestigious Lecture awarded by the Board of Trustees of the NRAO.  The Lectureship is awarded "to recognize outstanding contributions to the advancement of radio astronomy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrao.edu/jansky/janskyprize.shtml Jansky Prize - The Karl G. Jansky Lectureship]&lt;/ref&gt;  Recipients have included [[Fred Hoyle]], [[Charles Townes]], [[Edward M.

{{Term paper|date=June 2009}}
'''Neuropsychiatry''' is a branch of [[medicine]] that deals with [[mental disorders]] attributable to diseases of the [[nervous system]]. It preceded the current disciplines of [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]], which had common training,&lt;ref name=YH2002&gt;

Nevertheless, neuropsychiatry has become a growing subspecialty of [[psychiatry]] and it is also closely related to the fields of [[neuropsychology]] and [[behavioral neurology]].

==The case for the rapprochement of neurology and psychiatry==
Given the considerable overlap between these subspecialities, there has been a resurgence of interest and debate relating to neuropsychiatry in academia over the last decade.&lt;ref name=YH2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=M2002&gt;{{cite journal

Most of this work argues for a rapprochement of neurology and psychiatry, forming a specialty above and beyond a subspecialty of psychiatry. For example, Professor [[Joseph B. Martin]], former Dean of [[Harvard Medical School]] and a [[neurologist]] by training, has summarized the argument for reunion: "the separation of the two categories is arbitrary, often influenced by beliefs rather than proven scientific observations. And the fact that the brain and mind are one makes the separation artificial anyway."&lt;ref name="M2002"/&gt; These points and some of the other major arguments are detailed below.

===Mind/brain monism===
Neurologists have focused objectively on [[organic (model)|organic]] nervous system [[pathology]], especially of the [[brain]], whereas psychiatrists have laid claim to illnesses of the [[mind]]. This [[:wikt:antipodal|antipodal]] distinction between brain and mind as two different entities has characterized many of the differences between the two specialties. However, it has been argued that this division is fictional; evidence from the last century of research has shown that our mental life has its roots in the [[brain]].&lt;ref name=M2002/&gt; Brain and mind have been argued not to be discrete entities but just different ways of looking at the same system (Marr, 1982). It has been argued that embracing this mind/brain [[monism]] may be useful for several reasons. First, rejecting dualism implies that all mentation is biological, which provides a common research framework in which understanding and treatment of mental disorders can be advanced. Second, it mitigates widespread confusion about the legitimacy of mental illness by suggesting that all disorders should have a footprint in the brain.

In sum, a reason for the division between [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]] was the distinction between mind or first-person experience and the brain. That this difference is taken to be artificial by proponents of mind/brain monism supports a merge between these specialties.

===Causal pluralism===
One of the reasons for the divide is that [[neurology]] traditionally looks at the causes of disorders from an "inside-the-skin" perspective ([[neuropathology]], [[genetics]]) whereas [[psychiatry]] looks at "outside-the-skin" [[Causality|causation]] (personal, interpersonal, cultural).&lt;ref name=K2005/&gt; This dichotomy is argued not to be instructive and authors have argued that it is better conceptualized as two ends of a causal continuum.&lt;ref name=K2005/&gt; The benefits of this position are: firstly, understanding of [[etiology]] will be enriched, in particular between [[brain]] and [[social environment|environment]]. One example is [[eating disorders]], which have been found to have some neuropathology (Uher and Treasure, 2005) but also show increased incidence in rural Fijian school girls after exposure to [[television]] (Becker, 2004). Another example is [[schizophrenia]], the risk for which may be considerably reduced in a healthy family environment (Tienari et al., 2004).

It is also argued that this augmented understanding of etiology will lead to better remediation and rehabilitation strategies through an understanding of the different levels in the causal process where one can intervene. It may be that non-organic interventions, like [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), better attenuate disorders alone or in conjunction with drugs. Linden's (2006) demonstration of how [[psychotherapy]] has neurobiological commonalities with [[pharmacotherapy]] is a pertinent example of this and is encouraging from a patient perspective as the potentiality for pernicious side effects is decreased while self-efficacy is increased.

In sum, the argument is that an understanding of the mental disorders must not only have a specific knowledge of brain constituents and genetics (inside-the-skin) but also the context (outside-the-skin) in which these parts operate (Koch and Laurent, 1999). Only by joining neurology and psychiatry, it is argued, can this nexus be used to reduce human suffering.

===Organic basis===
To further sketch psychiatry's history shows a departure from structural neuropathology, relying more upon [[ideology]] (Sabshin, 1990). A good example of this is [[Tourette syndrome]], which Ferenczi (1921), although never having seen a patient with Tourette syndrome, suggested was the symbolic expression of [[masturbation]] caused by sexual repression. However, starting with the efficacy of neuroleptic drugs in attenuating symptoms (Shapiro, Shapiro and Wayne, 1973) the syndrome has gained pathophysiological support (e.g. Singer, 1997) and is hypothesized to have a genetic basis too, based on its high inheritability (Robertson, 2000). This trend can be seen for many hitherto traditionally psychiatric disorders (see table) and is argued to support reuniting [[neurology]] and [[psychiatry]] because both are dealing with disorders of the same system.

===Improved patient care===
Further, it is argued that this nexus will allow a more refined [[nosology]] of mental illness to emerge thus helping to improve [[therapy|remediation]] and [[psychiatric rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] strategies beyond current ones that lump together ranges of symptoms. However, it cuts both ways: traditionally neurological disorders, like [[Parkinson's disease]], are being recognized for their high incidence of traditionally psychiatric symptoms, like [[psychosis]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]] (Lerner and Whitehouse, 2002). These symptoms, which are largely ignored in [[neurology]],&lt;ref name="YH2002"/&gt; can be addressed by neuropsychiatry and lead to improved patient care. In sum, it is argued that patients from both traditional psychiatry and neurology departments will see their care improved following a reuniting of the specialties.

===Better management model===
Schiffer et al. (2004) argue that there are good management and financial reasons for rapprochement.

==US institutions==
"Behavioral Neurology &amp; Neuropsychiatry" fellowships are accredited by the United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties (UCNS; [http://www.ucns.org www.ucns.org]), in a manner analogous to the accreditation of [[psychiatry]] and [[neurology]] residencies in the United States by the [[American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology]] (ABPN).

The [[American Neuropsychiatric Association]] (ANPA) was established in 1988 and is the American medical subspecialty society for neuropsychiatrists. ANPA holds an annual meeting and offers other forums for education and professional networking amongst subspecialists in behavioral neurology &amp; neuropsychiatry as well as clinicians, scientists, and educators in related fields. American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. publishes the peer-reviewed ''[[Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences]]'', which is the official journal of ANPA.

The British NeuroPsychiatry Association (BNPA) was founded in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/content/pbrcpsych/12/5/174.2.full.pdf|title=Bulletin Of The Royal College Of Psychiatrists|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the leading academic and professional body for medical practitioners and professionals allied to medicine in the UK working at the interface of the clinical and cognitive neurosciences and psychiatry.

Recently, a new non-profit professional society named [[Neuropsychiatric Forum|Neuropsychiatric Forum (NPF)]] was founded. NPF aims to support effective communication and interdisciplinary collaboration, develop education schemes and research projects, organize neuropsychiatric conferences and seminars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1929">The '''New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room (NT.VMR)''' is a virtual manuscript reading room, where all New Testament manuscripts are available online.

It is aproject of the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]] in Münster / Westphalia.  Information is offered for manuscripts of the New Testament and is linked to the digitized pictures and transcriptions. This intergenerational project is to make all of the more than 5,800 Greek manuscripts of the New Testament digitally visible for research.

== VMR ==
In the Virtual Manuscript Room manuscripts can be selected and displayed. In order to meet different scientific purposes, there are three different viewer modes to choose from. The main mode is the ''reading mode'', which allows page-scrolling of a manuscript, while at the same time picture and transcript are displayed.

The provision of digital copies is done by its holding institutions (or by organisations that produce digital photos of manuscripts - like e.g. [[CSNTM]]). In this case, either newly built digital copies or scans of black-and-white microfilms from the 1960s to 1980s (from the archives of the INTF) can be chosen.

== Handschriftenliste ==
[[Kurt Aland]]s official "Kurzgefaßte Liste" of Greek manuscripts of the New Testament (2nd edition 1994) is available online. This covers all world famous New Testament manuscripts and has all most important key indicators. Be mentioned, inter alia:
* The century of creation
* Content
* Format
* Owner of the manuscript

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13355">'''Organizational ecology''' (also '''organizational demography''' and the '''population ecology of organizations''') is a theoretical and empirical approach in the [[social sciences]] that is considered a sub-field of [[organizational studies]].  Organizational ecology utilizes insights from [[biology]], [[economics]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[[Douma, Sytse]] and [[Hein Schreuder]], 2013. "Economic Approaches to Organizations". 5th edition. London: Pearson [http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Economic-Approaches-to-Organisations/9780273735298.page] {{ISBN|0273735292}} • {{ISBN|9780273735298}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sociology]], and employs statistical analysis to try to understand the conditions under which organizations emerge, grow, and die.

The ecology of organizations is divided into three levels, the community, the population, and the organization. The community level is the functionally integrated system of interacting populations. The population level is the set of organizations engaged in similar activities. The organization level focuses on the individual organizations (some research further divides organizations into individual member and sub-unit levels&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hannan, M., &amp; Freeman, J. (1977). The population ecology of organizations. ''American Journal of Sociology 82''(5), 929-964.&lt;/ref&gt;).

What is generally referred to as organizational ecology in research is more accurately population ecology, focusing on the second level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Baum, J., &amp; Shipilov, A. (2006). Ecological approaches to organizations. In S. Clegg, C. Hardy, T. Lawrence, &amp; W. Nord (Eds.) ''The Sage handbook of organization studies'' (pp. 55-110.) London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development  ==

Wharton School researcher William Evan called the population level the ''organization-set'', and focused on the interrelations of individual organizations within the population as early as 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Evan, W. (1966). "The organization-set" in J. Thompson (ed.) ''Approaches to Organizational Design''. Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, prior to the mid-1970s, the majority of organizational studies research focused on adaptive change in organizations (See also [[adaptive management]] and [[adaptive performance]]). The ecological approach moved focus to the environmental selection processes that affect organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1976, Eric Trist defined population ecology as "the study of the organizational field created by a number of organizations whose interrelations compose a system at the level of the whole field". He also advocated for organizational studies research to focus on populations and individual organizations as part of open rather than closed systems that have both bureaucratic (internal) regulation and ecological (community environment) regulation (see also [[Open and closed systems in social science]]).&lt;ref&gt;Trist, E. (1977). A Concept of Organizational Ecology. ''Australian Journal of Management 2''(2),  161-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first explicit formulation of a theory of population ecology, by [[Michael T. Hannan]] and the late [[John H. Freeman]] in their 1977 ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' piece "The population ecology of organizations" and later refined in their 1989 book ''[[Organizational Ecology]]'', examines the environment in which organizations compete and how a process like [[natural selection]] occurs.  This theory looks at the death of organizations (firm mortality), the birth of new organizations (organizational founding), as well as organizational growth and change.

Organizational ecology has over the years become one of the central fields in [[organizational studies]], and is known for its empirical, quantitative character. Ecological studies usually have a large-scale, longitudinal focus (datasets often span several decades, sometimes even centuries). The books ''The Demography of Corporations and Industries'' by Glenn Carroll and Michael Hannan (2000) and ''Logics of Organization Theory: Audiences, Codes, and Ecologies'' by Michael Hannan, Laszlo Polos, and Glenn Carroll (2007), provide the most comprehensive overview of the various theories and methods in organizational ecology.

== Key concerns ==
Organizational ecology focuses on how social (community) forces affect:
* rates of creation of new organizational forms
* rates of demise of organizations and organizational forms
* the rates of change in organizational forms.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, J., &amp; Lumsden, C. (1990). Theory and research in organizational ecology. ''Annual Review of Sociology 16''(1), 161-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organizational mortality ===
Organizational ecology is concerned with the capacity of the environment to support organizations and the rate of growth and decline of organizations within the environment. Each of these forces is a part of what is called ''Organizational Mortality''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Inertia and change ====
This factor holds that organizations that are reliable and accountable are those that can survive (favored by selection). A negative by-product, however, of the need for reliability and accountability is a high degree of inertia and a resistance to change. A key prediction of organizational ecology is that the process of change itself is so disruptive that it will result in an elevated rate of mortality.

Theories about inertia and change are fundamental to the research program of organizational ecology, which seeks a better understanding of the broader changes in the organizational landscape. Given the limits on firm-level adaptation, most of these broader changes thus come from the entry and selective replacement of organizations. Hence organizational ecology has spent considerable effort on understanding the founding and mortality rates of organizations.

Hannan and Freeman define organizational inertia in terms of internal and external restraints. Internal restraints include investment and sunk costs; availability of information for decision makers; political restraints such as organizational culture; and organization history. External restraints include legal and fiscal barriers to market entry and exit; availability of information about the environment; external legitimacy; and collective rationality and strategy&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (See also [[Bounded rationality]]).

==== Niche theory ====

Niche width distinguishes broadly between two types of organizations: generalists and specialists. Specialist organizations maximize their exploitation of the environment and accept the risk of experiencing a change in that environment. On the other hand, generalist organizations accept a lower level of exploitation in return for greater security.

Niche theory shows that specialization is generally favored in stable or certain environments. However, the main contribution of the niche theory is probably the finding that "generalism is not always optimal in uncertain environments". The exception is produced by environments which "place very different demands on the organization, and the duration of environmental states is short relative to the life of the organization".

Thus, the niche theory explains variations in industrial structure in different industries. The theory shows how different structures in different industries (generalist vs specialist organizations) are shaped by relevant environments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Density dependence ====

Organizational ecology also predicts that the rates of founding and mortality are dependent on the number of organizations (density) in the market. The two central mechanisms here are legitimization (the recognition or taken-for-grantedness of that group of organizations) and [[competition]]. Legitimization generally increases (at a decreasing rate) with the number of organizations, but so does competition (at an increasing rate). The result is that legitimization processes will prevail at low numbers of organizations, while competition will at high numbers.

The founding rate will therefore first increase with the number of organizations (due to an increase in legitimization) but will decrease at high numbers of organizations (due to competition). The reverse holds for mortality rates. Thus, the relationship of density to founding rates has an inverted U shape and the relationship of density to mortality rates follows a U-shaped pattern.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, G. (1984). Organizational ecology. ''Annual Review of Sociology 10''(1), 71-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Age dependence ====

How an organization's risk of mortality relates to the age of that organization has also been extensively examined. Here, organizational ecologists have found a number of patterns:

* '''Liability of newness'''. Here, the risk of failure is high initially but declines as the organization ages.
* '''Liability of adolescence'''. The risk of mortality will be low at first as the organization is buffered from failure due to support by external constituents and initial endowments. But when these initial resources become depleted, the mortality hazard shoots up and then declines following the liability of newness pattern.
* '''Liabilities of aging'''. Here, the risk of failure increases with organizational age. This could be due to a ''liability of senescence'' (internal inefficiencies arising from the aging of the organization) or a ''liability of obsolescence'' (a growing external mismatch with the environment).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Evolutionary approaches to organizations ==
Organizational ecology can be usefully compared with evolutionary theories in economics (e.g. Nelson &amp; Winter, 1982).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hannan and Freeman also note the influences of biological ecology and economic evolution on their population ecology model (specifically Elton, 1927; Durkheim, 1947; Hawley, 1950; and Hutchison, 1959).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Main similarities between these strands of literature are: (1) the emphasis on organizational routines and the limits to organizational adaptability, (2) the population or system level of analysis and (3) the importance of environmental selection. Organizational ecology's perspective is more Darwinistic (see Hannan &amp; Freeman, 1989, pp 20–22), while Nelson &amp; Winter (1982, p.&amp;nbsp;11) provide a more Lamarckian perspective.  Another important difference concerns the question: What is selected by the environment-- 'organizational forms', as in organizational ecology, or 'routines' as in the evolutionary economics literature? Authors like Joel Baum and Arjen van Witteloostuijn have argued for the potential of cross-fertilization between these two research strands.

A social networks perspective on the evolution of large scale interfirm organizational networks was presented by Braha et al.&lt;ref&gt;Braha, Dan, Blake Stacey, and Yaneer Bar-Yam, 2011. [http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/Journal_Version_SON_Braha.pdf “Corporate competition: A self-organized network”,] ''Social Networks'' 33 (3): 219–230.&lt;/ref&gt; who propose micro-dynamic models that reproduce actual large-scale interfirm perceived competition networks. Several evolutionary mechanisms of organizational networks are identified: spatial locations of firms are positively correlated with the population density; interfirm competition is governed by cumulative advantage rules and geographic distance; and competition network formation and firm size dynamics are closely intertwined.

{{one source|date=October 2018}}

{{Userspace draft|source=ArticleWizard|date=January 2013}} 

'''Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elect. Corp.''' is a key United States legal case from 1961 in [[trademark infringement]] law. It is also cited in [[personality rights]] particularly around celebrities. The decision set out that trademark infringement is measured by the multi-factor "likelihood of confusion" test. That is, a new mark will infringe on an existing trademark if the new mark is so similar to the original that consumers are likely to confuse the two marks, and mistakenly purchase from the wrong company.&lt;ref name=polaroid&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Polaroid v. Polarad |vol=287 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=492 |pinpoint= |court=2nd Cir. |date=1961 |url=http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Polaroid+Corporation+v.+Polarad+Electronics&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=4,60,107,112,114,122,127,129&amp;case=2293827617926067028&amp;scilh=0 |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The likelihood of confusion test turns on several factors,&lt;ref name=polaroid /&gt; including:
* Strength of the plaintiff's trademark; 
* Degree of similarity between the two marks at issue; 
* Similarity of the goods and services at issue;
* Evidence of actual confusion; 
* Purchaser sophistication; 
* Quality of the defendant's goods or services; 
* Defendant's intent in adopting the mark:  

This multi-factor test was famously articularted by Judge [[Henry Friendly]] in Polaroid v. Polarad.&lt;ref name=polaroid /&gt; and are often referred to as the "Polaroid Factors."&lt;ref&gt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jdlitman/classes/SI519/PFactors.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.upcounsel.com/likelihood-of-confusion-factors&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quimbee.com/keyterms/polaroid-factors&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pomology''' (from [[latin language|latin]] ''pomum'' ([[fruit]]) + ''-logy'') is a branch of [[botany]] that studies and cultivates [[fruit]]. The denomination '''fruticulture'''—introduced from [[Romance language]]s (from [[Latin]] ''fructus'' and ''cultura'')—is also used.

Pomological research is mainly focused on the development, enhancement, cultivation and physiological studies of fruit trees. The goals of fruit tree improvement include enhancement of fruit quality, regulation of production periods, and reduction of production cost. One involved in the science of pomology is called a '''pomologist'''.

==History==
Pomology has been an important area of research for centuries.

===United States===
During the mid-19th century in the [[United States]], farmers were expanding fruit orchard programs in response to growing markets. At the same time, horticulturists from the [[USDA]] and agricultural colleges were bringing new varieties to the United States from foreign expeditions, and developing experimental lots for these fruits. In response to this increased interest and activity, USDA established the Division of Pomology in 1886 and named Henry E. Van Deman as chief pomologist. An important focus of the division was to publish illustrated accounts of new varieties and to disseminate research findings to fruit growers and breeders through special publications and annual reports. During this period   [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] and his brother [[Charles Downing (pomologist)|Charles]] were prominent in Pomology and [[Horticulture]], producing ''The Fruits and Fruit Trees of America'' (1845).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZxADAAAAYAAJ&amp;oe=UTF-8 |title=''The Fruits and Fruit Trees of America'' (1845) online |accessdate=|date=|publisher=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of new varieties required exact depiction of the fruit so that plant breeders could accurately document and disseminate their research results. Since the use of scientific photography was not widespread in the late 19th Century, USDA commissioned artists to create watercolor illustrations of newly introduced [[cultivar]]s. Many of the watercolors were used for [[Lithography|lithographic reproductions]] in USDA publications, such as the ''Report of the Pomologist'' and the ''Yearbook of Agriculture''.

Today, the collection of approximately 7,700 watercolors is preserved in the [[National Agricultural Library|National Agricultural Library's]] Special Collections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/speccoll/collectionsguide.shtml |title=Guide to the USDA Special Collections |accessdate= |last= |first= |date=  |publisher=[[National Agricultural Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it serves as a major historic and botanic resource to a variety of researchers, including [[horticulturists]], historians, artists, and publishers..

The study of pomology has somewhat dwindled over the past century.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3649">{{short description|The rate of generation of biomass in an ecosystem}}
In [[ecology]], '''productivity''' refers to the rate of generation of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in an [[ecosystem]].  It is usually expressed in units of [[mass]] per unit surface (or volume) per unit time, for instance [[gram]]s per square metre per [[day]] (g m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).  The mass unit may relate to [[dry matter]] or to the mass of [[carbon-based life|carbon]] generated.  Productivity of [[autotroph]]s such as [[plant]]s is called '''primary productivity''', while that of [[heterotroph]]s such as [[animal]]s is called '''secondary productivity'''.&lt;ref name=allaby&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Michael |editor1-last=Allaby |title=A Dictionary of Ecology |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t14.e4512 |accessdate=2009-12-03 |edition=Third |year=2006 |origyear=1994 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-0-19-860905-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary production==
{{main|Primary production}}
[[Primary production]] is the synthesis of new organic material from inorganic molecules such as [[H2O|{{chem|H|2|O}}]] and [[CO2|{{chem|C|O|2}}]].  It is dominated by the process of [[photosynthesis]] which uses [[sunlight]] to synthesise organic molecules such as [[sugar]]

==Secondary production==
Secondary production is the generation of [[biomass]] of [[heterotroph]]ic (consumer) organisms in a system.  This is driven by the transfer of organic material between [[trophic level]]s, and represents the quantity of new [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] created through the use of [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilated]] food.  Secondary production is sometimes defined to only include consumption of primary producers by [[herbivory|herbivorous]] consumers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=secondary+production&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is |title=Definition of term: "Secondary production" |author= |date= |work=The Glossary Table |publisher=[[FishBase]] |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with tertiary production referring to [[Carnivory|carnivorous]] consumers),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=tertiary+production&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is |title=Definition of term: "Tertiary production" |author= |date= |work=The Glossary Table |publisher=[[FishBase]] |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is more commonly defined to include all biomass generation by heterotrophs.&lt;ref name=allaby/&gt;

Organisms responsible for secondary production include animals, [[protist]]s, [[fungi]] and many bacteria.

Secondary production can be estimated through a number of different methods including increment summation, removal summation, the instantaneous growth method and the Allen curve method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Allen | first=K.R. | year=1951 | title=The Horokiwi Stream: A study of a trout population | journal=New Zealand Marine Department Fisheries Bulletin | volume=10 | pages=1–238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice between these methods will depend on the assumptions of each and the ecosystem under study.  For instance, whether [[generational cohort|cohorts]] should be distinguished, whether linear mortality can be assumed and whether [[Population dynamics|population growth]] is exponential.

The '''Professional-Managerial class''' was an influential [[New Class]] hypothesis in [[social science]] in the United States in the 1970s by John and [[Barbara Ehrenreich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrenreich|first=John| title=Between Labor and Capital|year=1979|publisher=South End Press|location=Boston|isbn=0-89608-037-4|edition=1st|author2=Barbara Ehrenreich |editor=Pat Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ehrenreichs hypothesized a [[social class]] within [[capitalism]] that, by controlling production processes through superior management skills, was neither [[proletarian]] nor [[bourgeois]]. This hypothesis contributed to the [[Marxist]] debates on class in [[Fordism]] and was used as an analytical category in the examination of non-proletarian employees.

This group of [[middle class]] professionals is distinguished from other social classes by their training and education, typically business qualifications and university degrees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Philip|first=Green|title=Retrieving Democracy: In Search of Civic Equality|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/middle-class#cite_note-25|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt; with occupations including [[academics]], [[teachers]], [[social workers]], [[engineers]], [[managers]], [[nurses]], and middle-level [[Administrator (business)|administrators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kellner|first=Hansfried|title=Hidden Technocrats: The New Class and New Capitalism|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/middle-class#cite_note-26|publisher=Transaction Publishers|author2=Frank W. Heuberger |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The professional-managerial class tends to have incomes above the average for their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gail|first=Kelly|title=Women's higher education in comparative perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-CKcuRAu8EC&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=Professional+Managerial+Class+salary&amp;q=Professional+Managerial+Class+salary&amp;hl=en#v=snippet&amp;q=Professional%20Managerial%20Class%20salary&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer|author2=Sheila Slaughter |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that in the [[United States]] during 1930, people in professional-managerial class occupations made up less than 1 percent of total employment. In 1972, about 24 percent of American jobs were in professional-managerial class occupations. By 1983 the number had risen to 28 percent and in 2006, 35 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ehrenreich|first=Barbara|title=Barbara and John Ehrenreich: The Real Story Behind the Crash and Burn of America's Managerial Class|url=http://www.alternet.org/economy/barbara-and-john-ehrenreich-real-story-behind-crash-and-burn-americas-managerial-class?page=0%2C0|work=AlterNet|accessdate=18 November 2013|author2=John Ehrenreich |date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Psychographics''' is a qualitative methodology used to describe consumers on psychological attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=William D.|date=May 1975|title=Psychographics: A critical review|jstor=3150443|journal=Journal of Marketing Research|volume=12|pages=196–213|doi=10.2307/3150443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychographics have been applied to the study of [[personality]], values, [[opinions]], [[Attitudes (psychology)|attitudes]], [[self-interest|interests]], and lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Jairo Senise | title = Who Is Your Next Customer?

  | date = 28 September 2007
  | url =http://www.strategy-business.com/press/enewsarticle/enews092807}}&lt;/ref&gt; While psychographics are often equated with lifestyle research, it has been argued{{who|date=October 2017}} that psychographics should apply to the study of cognitive attributes such as attitudes, interests, opinions, and beliefs while lifestyle should apply to the study of overt behavior (e.g., activities).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson Jr|first=Thomas W.|last2=Golden|first2=Linda L.|date=1984|title=Lifestyle and psychographics: A critical review and recommendation.|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=00989258&amp;AN=6434172&amp;h=CIsX9Zir8%2b8NXi2BVIt1%2ffswaNv5juoKSAJqetpjmxf4Khxm%2fZCptEMhYQr3%2bMVxLq9TwmulOd3X3PhafMUluA%3d%3d&amp;crl=c&amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d00989258%26AN%3d6434172|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|volume=11|pages=405–411|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because this area of research focuses on activities, interests, and opinions, psychographic factors are sometimes abbreviated to 'AIO variables'.

==Use==
Psychographic studies of individuals or communities can be valuable in the fields of [[marketing]], [[Demographic profile|demographics]], opinion research, prediction, and [[social studies|social research]] in general. Psychographic attributes can be contrasted with demographic variables (such as age and gender), behavioral variables (such as purchase data or usage rate), and organizational descriptors (sometimes called [[firmographics|firmographic]] variables), such as industry, number of employees, and functional area.

Psychographic methods gained prominence in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 US presidential election]] due to its use in [[microtargeting]] advertisements to narrow constituencies by [[Cambridge Analytica]].&lt;!-- Is the horse's mouth a valid cite? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8Dd5aVXLCc --&gt;

==Comparison to demographics==
Psychographics is often confused with [[demographic profile|demographics]], where historical generations may be defined both by demographics, such as the years in which a particular generation is born or even the fertility rates of that generation's parents, but also by psychographic variables like attitudes, personality formation, and cultural touchstones. For example, the traditional approaches to defining the [[Baby Boom Generation]] or [[Generation X]] or [[Millennials]] have relied on both demographic variables (classifying individuals based on birth years) and psychographic variables (such as beliefs, attitudes, values and behaviors).

[[Infusionsoft]] published an article arguing than customer psychographic segmentation is more useful than demographic information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Psychographic profiling==
When a relatively complete profile of a person or group's psychographic make-up is constructed, this is called a "psychographic profile". Psychographic profiles are used in [[market segmentation]] as well as in [[advertising]]. Some categories of psychographic factors used in market segmentation include:
* activity, interest, opinion (AIOs)
* attitudes
* [[values]]
* behavior

Psychographic can also be seen as an equivalent of the concept of "culture" when it is used for segmentation at a national level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://learn.infusionsoft.com/marketing/email-marketing/why-psychographic-segmentation-is-important/|title=Why Psychographic Segmentation is Important|last=Saunders|first=Amy|date=2016-05-09|work=Infusionsoft.com|access-date=2018-03-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{no footnotes|date=June 2009}}

In [[database]] technologies, a '''rollback''' is an operation which returns the database to some previous state. Rollbacks are important for database [[data integrity|integrity]], because they mean that the database can be restored to a clean copy even after erroneous operations are performed. They are crucial for recovering from database server crashes; by rolling back any [[Database transaction|transaction]] which was active at the time of the crash, the database is restored to a consistent state.

The rollback feature is usually implemented with a [[Database log|transaction log]], but can also be implemented via [[multiversion concurrency control]].

==Cascading rollback==
A ''cascading rollback'' occurs in database systems when a transaction (T1) causes a failure and a rollback must be performed. Other transactions dependent on T1's actions must also be rollbacked due to T1's failure, thus causing a cascading effect. That is, one transaction's failure causes many to fail.

Practical database recovery techniques guarantee cascadeless rollback, therefore a cascading rollback is not a desirable result.

==SQL==
In [[SQL]], &lt;code&gt;ROLLBACK&lt;/code&gt; is a command that causes all data changes since the last &lt;code&gt;[[Begin work (SQL)|BEGIN WORK]]&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;[[Start transaction (SQL)|START TRANSACTION]]&lt;/code&gt; to be discarded by the [[relational database management systems]] (RDBMS), so that the state of the data is "rolled back" to the way it was before those changes were made.

A &lt;code&gt;ROLLBACK&lt;/code&gt; statement will also release any existing [[savepoint]]s that may be in use.

In most SQL dialects, &lt;code&gt;ROLLBACK&lt;/code&gt;s are connection specific.  This means that if two connections are made to the same database, a &lt;code&gt;ROLLBACK&lt;/code&gt; made in one connection will not affect any other connections.  This is vital for proper [[Concurrent programming|concurrency]].

'''Spatial justice''' links together [[social justice]] and space, most notably in the works of geographers [[David Harvey]] and [[Edward W. Soja]]. The organization of space is a crucial dimension of human societies and reflects social facts and influences social relations ([[Henri Lefebvre]], 1968, 1972). Consequently, both [[justice]] and injustice become visible in space. Therefore, the analysis of the interactions between space and society is necessary to understand social injustices and to formulate territorial policies aiming at tackling them. It is at this junction that the concept of spatial justice has been developed.

== Social justice ==

According to this political theory, space being a fundamental dimension of human societies, [[social justice]] is embedded in it. So the understanding of interactions between space and societies is essential to the understanding of social injustices and to a reflection on planning policies that aims at reducing them. This reflection can be guided by the concept of spatial justice, which ties Social Justice with space.
Spatial justice is a crucial challenge because it is the ultimate goal of many planning policies. However, the diversity of definitions of "[[Justice]]" (and of the possible "[[social contract]]s" that legitimate them), is high and the political objectives of [[regional planning]] or [[urban planning]] can be quite different and even contradictory.

Therefore, it is important to analyze the concept of spatial justice, which is still rarely questioned (particularly since the work of Anglo-American [[critical geography|radical geographers]] in the 1970s–1980s&lt;ref&gt;See [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], ''Social Justice and the City'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;) to the extent that it has been taken for granted. These past few years, several events and publications have demonstrated the rising interest of human and social sciences for the concept of spatial justice.&lt;ref&gt;A conference investigating the concept of spatial justice was held in March 2008 at the University Paris-Ouest Nanterre, France. Moreover, ''justice spatiale - spatial justice'', a scientific Journal centered on Spatial Justice has been created in 2009: http://jssj.org/. A book focused on Spatial Justice has also been written by [[Edward W. Soja]] in 2010 : 
SOJA Edward W., 2010, ''Seeking Spatial Justice'', Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Between issues of redistribution and decision-making processes ==
The concept of spatial justice opens up several perspectives for social sciences. Building on the work of several famous Justice philosophers ([[John Rawls]], 1971; [[Iris Marion Young]], 1990, 2000), two contrasting approaches of justice have polarized the debate: one focuses on redistribution issues, the other concentrates on decision-making processes. 
A first set of approaches consists in asking questions about spatial or socio-spatial distributions and working to achieve an equal geographical distribution of society's wants and needs, such as [[Employment|job opportunities]], [[Health disparities|access to health care]], [[Air Quality Index|good air quality]], et cetera.  This is of particular concern in regions where the population has difficulty moving to a more spatially just location due to poverty, discrimination, or political restrictions (such as apartheid [[pass laws]]).  Even in free, developed nations, access to many places are limited.  Geographer [[Don Mitchell (geographer)|Don Mitchell]] points to the mass [[privatization]] of once-public land as a common example of spatial injustice. In this distributive justice perspective, the access to material and immaterial goods, or to social positions indicates whether the situation is fair or not. At the scale of urban space, questions of accessibility, walkability and transport equity can also be seen as matters of distribution of spatial resources.

Another way of tackling the concept of spatial justice is to focus on decision-making procedures: this approach also raises issues of representations of space, of territorial or other identities and of social practices. For instance, focusing on minorities allows to explore their spatial practices but also to investigate how these are experienced and managed by various agents: this may lead to reveal forms of [[oppression]] or [[discrimination]] that a universalist approach might disregard otherwise.
In sum, depending on the chosen approach, either questions are asked about spatial distributions because justice is evaluated from "results", or questions are asked about space representations, (spatial or not) identities and experiences because justice is defined as a process. Spatial justice stands as a unifying concept for the social sciences: its coherence stems from a reflection on the modalities of the political decision-making and on the policies implemented in order to improve spatial distributions.

== Environmental justice ==
The emergence of the concept of [[sustainable development]] has also fostered a debate on environmental equity. It questions our ontological relationship to the world, and the possibility of a fair policy addressing the needs of mankind, present and future, local and global, and of new forms of governance. The notion of "Environmental Justice" was created in the 1970s–1980s in North American cities to denounce the spatial overlapping between forms of [[racial discrimination]] and social-economic exclusion, industrial pollutions and vulnerability to natural hazards.

'''Stewart Russell''' (6 August 1955 – 17 September 2011) was a senior lecturer and interdisciplinary researcher in Science, Technology and Innovation Studies at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Innovative in his approach, Stewart believed that to achieve sustainable change it was necessary to address the interplay between science and technology and social and institutional factors. He worked with a diverse communities including trade unions, government and public institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary Stewart Russell|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=417803|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating in physical science from Pembroke College, Cambridge, UK, Stewart made a sharp turn towards social science and took a PhD in the Technology Policy Unit of [[Aston University]], UK. He dedicated the rest of his career to exploring the challenges of environmental sustainability across a range of technological fields.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|title=Stewart Russell obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/oct/23/stewart-russell-obituary|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=27 October 2012|location=London|first=Robin|last=Williams|date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 he accepted a position as lecturer in Science, Technology and Society at the [[University of Wollongong]], in New South Wales, Australia. He returned to the United Kingdom in 2006 to join the University of Edinburgh as deputy director of the Research Centre for Social Sciences. In this role he helped build the interdisciplinary research programmes of the [[Institute for the Study of Science, Technology and Innovation]], and bring together the Research Centre for Social Studies and Science Studies Unit as the Science, Technology and Innovation Studies subject group. Collaborating with the [[National Museum of Scotland]] Stewart developed the innovative "Understanding Technology" public lecture series.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stewart Russell - About - Science, Technology and Innovation Studies |url=http://www.stis.ed.ac.uk/archive/about/stewart_russell |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225145734/http://www.stis.ed.ac.uk/archive/about/stewart_russell |archivedate=25 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These lectures are continued and held to commemorate his contribution.

On 30 March 2012 a symposium was held to celebrate his contribution to the academic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stewart Russell Symposium|url=http://www.issti.ed.ac.uk/news_and_events/stewart_russell_symposium|publisher=University of Edinburgh|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Stewart Russell Memorial Fund to support students at the University of Edinburgh was established to commemorate his commitment and passion in helping students achieve their full potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stewart Russell Award for MSc (Research) Science and Technology Studies - News - Science, Technology and Innovation Studies |url=http://www.stis.ed.ac.uk/news/2014/stewart_russell_award_for_msc_research_science_and_technology_studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tonic''' in physiology refers to a physiological response which is slow and may be graded.  This term is typically used in opposition to a fast response.  For instance, tonic muscles are contrasted by the more typical and much faster twitch muscles, while tonic sensory nerve endings are contrasted to the much faster [[Sensory neuron#Rate of adaptation|phasic]] sensory nerve endings.

==Tonic muscles==
Tonic muscles are much slower than twitch fibers in terms of time from stimulus to full activation, time to full relaxation upon cessation of stimuli, and maximal shortening velocity.&lt;ref name="Kardong"&gt;Kardong, K. 2008. Vertebrates: Comparative Anatomy, Function, Evolution. 5th edition. McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math. {{ISBN|978-0-07-304058-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These muscles are rarely found in mammals (only in the muscles moving the eye and in the middle ear), but are common in reptiles and amphibians.&lt;ref name="Kardong"/&gt;

==Tonic sensory receptors==
Tonic sensory input adapts slowly to a stimulus&lt;ref name = caspar&gt;http://caspar.bgsu.edu/~courses/Glossary.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to produce [[action potential]]s over the duration of the stimulus.&lt;ref name="mentor"&gt;Dawson, M., Schell, A., &amp; Filion, D. (2007). The Electrodermal System. In J. Cacioppo, L. Tassinary, &amp; G. Berntson (Eds.), ''Handbook of Psychophysiology'' (pp. 159-181). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way it conveys information about the duration of the stimulus.  In contrast, phasic receptors adapt rapidly to a stimulus. The response of the cell diminishes very quickly and then stops.&lt;ref name = caspar /&gt; It does not provide information on the duration of the stimulus;&lt;ref name = mentor /&gt; instead some of them convey information on rapid changes in stimulus intensity and rate.&lt;ref name=frank&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frank.mtsu.edu/~jshardo/bly2010/nervous/receptor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803215836/http://frank.mtsu.edu/~jshardo/bly2010/nervous/receptor.html |archivedate=2008-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a tonic receptor is the [[Ruffini corpuscle]].

A tonic receptor is a sensory receptor that adapts slowly to a stimulus and continues to produce action potentials over the duration of the stimulus. In this way it conveys information about the duration of the stimulus. Some tonic receptors are permanently active and indicate a background level. Examples of such tonic receptors are pain receptors, joint capsule, and muscle spindle.&lt;ref name="mentor" /&gt;

'''Women in music education''' describes the role of [[Women in music|women musicians, conductors, teachers and educational administrators]] in [[music education]] at the [[elementary school]] and [[secondary education]] levels. While [[music critic]]s argued in the 1880s that "...women lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to "biological predisposition",&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php |title=Women Composers In American Popular Song, Page 1 |publisher=Parlorsongs.com |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, it was accepted that women would have a role in [[music education]], and they became involved in this field "...to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; "Traditional accounts of the history of music education [in the US] have often neglected the contributions of women, because these texts have emphasized bands and the top leaders in hierarchical music organizations." &lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking beyond these bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "...home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "...as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations."&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"/&gt;

Despite the limitations imposed on women's roles in music education in the 19th century, women were accepted as [[kindergarten]] teachers, because this was deemed to be a "private sphere". Women also taught music privately, in girl's schools, Sunday schools, and they trained musicians in school music programs. By the turn of the 20th century, women began to be employed as music supervisors in elementary schools, teachers in [[normal school]]s and professors of music in universities. Women also became more active in professional organizations in music education, and women presented papers at conferences.

A woman, Frances Clarke (1860–1958) founded the [[National Association for Music Education|Music Supervisors National Conference]] in 1907. While a small number of women served as President of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female Presidents between 1952 and 1992, which "[p]ossibly reflects discrimination." After 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female Presidents of this organization.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/bigbadbariguru/a-historical-view-of-women-in-music-education-careers |title=A historical view of women in music education careers |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2012-07-05 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women music educators "outnumber men two-to-one" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; More men tend to be hired as for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a "[[glass ceiling]]" for women in music education careers, as there is "stigma" associated with women in leadership positions and "men outnumber women as administrators."&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt;
