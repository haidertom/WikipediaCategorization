'''ArtAbilitation''' is an international conference platform for people with [[disability|disabilities]] and a movement that started in 2006 as coined/originated by Anthony (aka Tony) Brooks. The concept was realized as an international conference, workshop series, and symposium, and was inaugurated in [[Esbjerg, Denmark]], in September 2006 when supporting the ICDVRAT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icdvrat.rdg.ac.uk|title=ICDVRAT - International Conference Series on Disability, Virtual Reality and Associated Technologies|author=Paul Sharkey|website=Icdvrat.rdg.ac.uk|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in celebrating its tenth anniversary. Selected authors from this inaugural event published their papers in the Routledge International Journal Digital Creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~content=g778864938~db=all|title=Editorial: ArtAbilitation|author=Tony Brooks|pages=65-68|date=18 May 2007|website=Informaworld.com|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a778860902~db=all~order=page|journal=

The events of ICDVRAT &amp; ArtAbilitation 2006 were reported in the International Journal for [[Virtual reality|Virtual Reality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijvr.org/reports%20and%20experts/report_ICDVRAT.pdf International Journal for Virtual Reality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119232458/http://www.ijvr.org/reports%20and%20experts/report_ICDVRAT.pdf |date=November 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the second ArtAbilitation conference supported the 17th International Conference for [[Artificial reality|Artificial Reality]] &amp; Telexistence (ICAT). ICAT is the oldest international conference on Virtual Reality and the hosting in Esbjerg, Denmark. This was the first time the event was held outside the [[Asia Pacific]] region. ICAT is organised by the Virtual Reality Society of Japan (VRSJ). ICAT 2006 was held at [[Zhejiang University of Technology]] in China.  Archives of ICAT2007 are online at IEEE site. The first international symposium ‘Ludic Engagement Designs for All’ supported.{{Clarify|date=October 2010}}

The 3rd ArtAbilitation Conference was held alongside ICDVRAT 2008 in [[Maia, Portugal]], on September 8 through 10th. A special session on music was hosted at [[Casa da Música|Casa da Musica]], Porto, Portugal, on 11 September. This was followed by the ''2nd International Congress on Art, Brain and Languages'', hosted in Casa da Musica in Porto on 11 and 12 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk/ABL_Programme.pdf |title=2nd International Congress on Art, Brain &amp; languages |website=Cmr.soc.plymouth.ac.uk|accessdate=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference combines various areas of knowledge such as [[Neuropsychology]], [[Musicology|Musical Sciences]], [[Theatre|Theatrical Arts]], [[Art therapy|Art Therapy]], and [[Linguistics]]. It aims for a holistic, interdisciplinary approach to education, disability, and rehabilitation. It intends to question how the inter-related practice and processing of different types of language (musical, psychomotor, verbal, technological, and aesthetic) can intervene in education and disability (motor, verbal or mental).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

ArtAbilitation 2010 was held in Chile and focused on Human Performance via Digital Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/artabilitation-2010/|title=ArtAbilitation 2010 - Kurzweil|website=Kurzweilai.net|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17543">'''Building services engineering''' is a [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|professional engineering]] discipline that strives to achieve a safe and comfortable [[Indoor air quality|indoor environment]] whilst minimizing the [[environmental impact]] of a [[building]].

'''Alternative titles''': The term ''Building services engineering'' is also commonly known as ''Architectural engineering'', ''Technical building services'', ''Building engineering'', or ''Facilities and services planning engineering''. The term ''Building services engineering'' is widely used in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries (incl. [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]]), but in the [[United States of America]], the field is also known as ''Building systems engineering'', ''[[Architectural engineering]]'' or ''[[Building engineering]]'', though the latter two disciplines generally have a broader scope, also encompassing elements of [[Structural engineering]] and more traditional architectural tasks such as room planning and material selection. In India the engineers are known as ''facilities planners''. In some counties, a ''building services architect'' is an engineer with experience in the integration of building services.

==Scope==
Building services engineers are responsible for the design, installation, operation and monitoring of the technical services in buildings (including [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[public health system]]s, also known as [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|MEP]] or [[HVAC]]), in order to ensure the safe, comfortable and [[environmentally friendly]] operation. Building services [[engineer]]s work closely with other construction professionals such as architects, structural engineers and quantity surveyors. Building services engineers influence the architectural design of building, in particular facades, in relation to [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and indoor environment, and can integrate local energy production (e.g. façade-integrated [[photovoltaics]]) or community-scale energy facilities (e.g. [[district heating]]). Building services engineers therefore play an important role in the design and operation of energy-efficient buildings (including [[green building]]s, [[passive house]]s, and [[Energy-plus-house|Plus-houses]], and [[Zero-energy building]]s). With buildings accounting for about a third of all carbon emissions&lt;ref&gt;https://webstore.iea.org/technology-roadmap-energy-efficient-buildings-heating-and-cooling-equipment&lt;/ref&gt; and over a half of the global electricity demand,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/buildings/&lt;/ref&gt; building services engineers play an important role in the move to a [[Low-carbon economy|low-carbon society]], hence mitigate [[global warming]].

The career path of a building services engineer can take a very wide range of directions. Within the broad field of building services engineering, new roles are emerging, for example specialization in [[renewable energy]], [[sustainability]], low-carbon technologies, energy management, [[building automation]], and [[Building information modeling|building information modeling (BIM)]]. Building services engineers increasingly seek status as accredited [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), [[BREEAM]] (BRE Environmental Assessment Method), or CIBSE Low Carbon Consultants (LCC) and Energy Assessors (LCEA) auditors, in addition to their status as [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|chartered]]/[[European Engineer|professional engineer]].

Building services engineering encompasses much more than just [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|MEP]] or [[HVAC]]), but also the following:
* '''Mechanical''' services:
** [[Energy]] supply – [[gas]], [[electricity]] and [[renewable energy|renewable]] sources
** [[Escalators]] and [[Elevator|lifts]]
** [[Heating]] including low-exergy (low-temperature) solutions
** [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]]. This includes clean-room solutions (e.g. hospitals, labs) and industrial ventilation (factory spaces and processes)
** [[Air conditioning]] and other applications of [[refrigeration]]
* '''Electrical''' services:
** [[Low voltage]] (LV) systems, [[distribution board]]s and [[switchgear]]
** Communication lines, telephones and IT networks ([[Information and communications technology|ICT]])
** [[Building automation]]
** [[Lightning]] protection
** [[Fire]] detection and protection
** [[Security]] and [[alarm]] systems
* '''Public health''' services:
** [[Plumbing]] solutions for [[water]] supply, both potable cold water and DHW (domestic hot water), 
** [[Drainage]] of waste water (sewage) from inside a building and drainage/treatment of external surface runoff around a building. Increasing use of grey-water recycling and solutions to delay runoff (e.g. green roofs and infiltration beds)
** Solutions for [[hygiene]] and [[sanitation]], including [[cleaning]], [[indoor air quality]], and health technology (e.g. isolation wards)
* '''Other''':
** Building-integrated features such as [[passive cooling]]
** [[Natural lighting]] and [[artificial lighting]], and building [[facades]]
** [[Building engineering physics|Building physics]], especially related to heat and moisture transfer, daylighting etc.

Examples of roles/duties a Building Services Engineer may have include:
* '''[[Consultant]] engineer''': Designing layouts and requirements for building services for residential or commercial developments. Design management is the business side of design, which aims to create the right environment to control and support a culture of creativity and innovation, and to embrace the iterative nature of design involving the many disciplines that, collectively, will deliver design solutions – and all at the same time as ensuring that an organisation’s commercial goals and objectives are achieved and that all is done in an ethically sound way. Typically the building services engineering installation is worth 30–60% of the total value of a contract. Design management is not the same as project management. Project management focuses on a wider range of administrative skills but is not normally sympathetic to the peculiarities of delivering a fully coordinated functioning design, taking into account its unique nature and dealing with the changing requirements of clients and the external factors over which there is little control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Portman|first=Jackie|title=Building Services Design Management|date=July 2014|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford:UK|isbn=978-1118528129}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[General contractor|Contractor]]''': Supervising the installation of the building services, commissioning systems. This includes tasks such as [[Testing, adjusting, balancing|TABS]].
* '''[[Facility management|Facilities manager]]''': Operation, servicing, and continuous commissioning of existing buildings and plant.

==Professional bodies==
The two most notable professional bodies are:
* The [[ASHRAE|American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers]] (ASHRAE) was founded in 1894.
* The [[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers]] (CIBSE) was founded in 1976, and received a Royal Charter in the [[United Kingdom]], and formally recognising building services engineering as a profession. Its objectives of the Institution are to: ''support the Science, Art and Practice of building services engineering, by providing our members and the public with first class information and education services and promoting the spirit of fellowship which guides our work.''

==Education==
Building services engineers typically possess an academic degree in building services engineering, [[mechanical engineering]] or [[electrical engineering]]. The length of study for such a degree is usually 3–4 years for a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (BEng) or [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc) and 5–6 years for a [[Master of Engineering]] (MEng).

The list below includes accredited education programs. In the United Kingdom, the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers ([[Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers|CIBSE]]) accredits university degrees in Building Services Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cibse.org/membership/accredited-courses/list-of-accredited-courses&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[ABET]] accredits degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abet.org/AccredProgramSearch/AccreditationSearch.aspx Search All Accredited Programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817205746/http://www.abet.org/AccredProgramSearch/AccreditationSearch.aspx |date=2011-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building services engineering software==
Many tasks in building services engineering involve the use of engineering software, for example to design/model or draw solutions. The most common types of tool are whole building energy simulation&lt;ref&gt;K. Mahmud, U. Amin, M.J. Hossain, J. Ravishankar, "Computational tools for design, analysis, and management of residential energy systems", Applied Energy, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.111&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] (traditionally 2D) or the increasingly popular [[Building Information Modeling]] (BIM) which is 3D. 3D BIM software can have integrated tools for Building Services calculations such sizing ventilation ducts or estimating noise levels. Another use of 3D/4D BIM is that empowers more informed decision making and better coordination between different disciplines, such as [[collision detection|'collision testing']].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2820">[[File:CHOMBEClogo.jpg|frame]]'''CHOMBEC''' stands for the Centre for the History of Music in Britain, the Empire and the Commonwealth.  It was a part of the music department at the [[University of Bristol]] (UK) until the summer of 2017.  It was founded in 2006 by Professor [[Stephen Banfield]]. CHOMBEC's aims were to encourage and provide a focal point for research into the history of music in the [[British Empire]], in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and within the [[West Country]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nabmsa.org/newsletters/vol22/page3.htm North American British Music Studies Association, Vol.2, No.2 (Autumn 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

CHOMBEC, in association with the University of Bristol, ran an MA ([[Master of Arts]]) degree in [[Music of the United Kingdom|British music]].  The programme offered the opportunity to specialise in music of the British Empire and music in the West Country.

CHOMBEC also ran seminars and conferences on various aspects of British music.  These have included '[[Vaughan Williams]], [[John Hardy (composer)|Hardy]] and the Ninth Symphony' (spring 2008), '[[Rubbra]] Revived: Sinfonia Sacra and Beyond' (Spring 2008), 'The Sounds of [[Stonehenge]]' (autumn 2008), 'Celebrating [[George Dyson (composer)|George Dyson]]' (spring 2007), and '[[Robert Pearsall]] - Bristol's Forgotten Composer' (autumn 2006).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pearsall2006.org/news/ 2006 - The Anniversary of Robert Lucas Pearsall]&lt;/ref&gt;  The most recent, 'The Sounds of Stonehenge' explored the multiple soundscapes of the ancient stone's 5,000-year history.  The cultural history of the stones, their acoustics, and Neolithic England's musical instruments were presented in a one-day workshop that brought Stonehenge's legend up-to-date with its depiction and importance in film and rock music.

CHOMBEC still hosts a number of academic archives that have been donated to the Centre since it was founded.  Archives are held at the university's Special Collections section of the Arts and Social Sciences Library and can include manuscript scores, audio recordings, and personal papers relating to the composers and their lives.  In 2008 archives for Edgar Hunt, Sir [[Michael Tippett]], a combined archive for [[Frank Merrick]] and Evelyn Hope Squire, and one for John Raynor were all acquired by the university. These archives join the Stanley Godman archive donated in 2007.

CHOMBEC published a twice-yearly newsletter, ''CHOMBEC News'', with articles on composers, performers, and research projects around the world: archive copies of older editions of ''CHOMBEC News'' can be downloaded from their website as PDF files.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5481">In [[genetics]], a '''centimorgan''' (abbreviated '''cM''') or '''map unit''' (m.u.) is a unit for measuring [[genetic linkage]].  It is defined as the distance between chromosome positions (also termed [[locus (genetics)|loci]] or [[genetic marker|markers]]) for which the expected average number of intervening [[chromosomal crossover]]s in a single generation is 0.01.  It is often used to infer distance along a [[chromosome]]. However, it is not a true physical distance.

== Relation to physical distance==
The number of base-pairs to which it corresponds varies widely across the [[genome]] (different regions of a chromosome have different propensities towards crossover) and it also depends on if the meiosis where the crossing-over takes place is a part of oogenesis (formation of female gametes) or  spermatogenesis (formation of male gametes).

One centimorgan corresponds to about 1 million base pairs in humans on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Terms and Definitions |website= Office of Rare Diseases Research |publisher= [[National Institutes of Health]] |url= http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/Glossary.aspx?acronym=False#C |deadurl= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120717121400/http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/Glossary.aspx?acronym=False#C |archive-date= 2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Harvey Lodish |author2=Arnold Berk |author3=Paul Matsudaira |author4=Chris A.

Morton et al. calculated that the female genome is 4782 centimorgans long, while the male genome is only 2809 centimorgans long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=NE|title=Parameters of the human genome.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=1 September 1991|volume=88|issue=17|pages=7474–6|pmid=1881886|quote=Evidence on genetic parameters includes chiasma counts and linkage maps corrected for failure to sample telomeres, giving an autosomal size of 2809 centimorgans in males and 4782 centimorgans in females.|bibcode=1991PNAS...88.7474M|doi=10.1073/pnas.88.17.7474|pmc=52322}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' has an average recombination distance of ~15 kb per centimorgan: markers separated by 15 kb of DNA (15,000 nucleotides) have an expected rate of chromosomal crossovers of 0.01 per generation.  Note that non-[[Synteny|syntenic]] genes (genes residing on different chromosomes) are inherently unlinked, and cM distances have no meaning between them.

==Relation to the probability of recombination ==
Because [[genetic recombination]] between two markers is detected only if there are an odd number of chromosomal crossovers between the two markers, the distance in centimorgans does not correspond exactly to the probability of genetic recombination.  Assuming [[Haldane's map function]], in which the number of chromosomal crossovers is distributed according to a [[Poisson distribution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ag.ndsu.nodak.edu/plantsci/adv_genetics/genetics/mf/mf01.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321211822/http://www.ag.ndsu.nodak.edu/plantsci/adv_genetics/genetics/mf/mf01.htm |archive-date=2012-03-21 |title=Mapping Functions |publisher=Department of Plant Sciences |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a genetic distance of ''d'' centimorgans will lead to an odd number of chromosomal crossovers, and hence a detectable genetic recombination, with probability
:&lt;math&gt;\Pr[\text{recombination}|\text{linkage of }d\text{ cM}] = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \Pr[2k + 1 \text{ crossovers}|\text{linkage of }d\text{ cM}]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} e^{-d/100} \frac{(d/100)^{2\,k+1}}{(2\,k+1)!} = e^{-d/100} \sinh(d/100) = \frac{1 - e^{-2d/100}}{2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where sinh is the [[hyperbolic sine]] function.  The probability of recombination is approximately ''d''/100 for small values of ''d'' and approaches 50% as ''d'' goes to infinity.

The formula can be inverted, giving the distance in centimorgans as a function of the recombination probability:
:&lt;math&gt;d=50 \ln\left({\frac{1}{1 - 2 \Pr[\text{recombination}]}}\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Etymology==
The centimorgan was named in honor of geneticist [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] by his student [[Alfred Henry Sturtevant]]. However, its parent unit, the morgan, is rarely used today.

'''Classical control theory''' is a branch of [[control theory]] that deals with the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s with inputs, and how their behavior is modified by [[feedback]], using the [[Laplace transform]] as a basic tool to model such systems.

The usual objective of control theory is to control a system, often called the ''[[Plant (control theory)|plant]]'', so its output follows a desired control signal, called the ''[[reference]]'', which may be a fixed or changing value.  To do this a ''[[Controller (control theory)|controller]]'' is designed, which monitors the output and compares it with the reference.  The difference between actual and desired output, called the ''error'' signal, is applied as [[feedback]] to the input of the system, to bring the actual output closer to the reference.

Classical control theory deals with [[linear time-invariant system|linear time-invariant]] [[single-input single-output]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zhong|first1=Wan-Xie|title=Duality System in Applied Mechanics and Optimal Control|date=2004|publisher=Kluwer|isbn=978-1-4020-7880-4|page=283|quote=The classical controller design methodology is iterative, and is effective for single-input, single-output linear time-invariant system analysis and design.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Laplace transform of the input and output signal of such systems can be calculated. The [[transfer function]] relates the Laplace transform of the input and the output.

==Feedback==

To overcome the limitations of the [[open-loop controller]], classical control theory introduces [[feedback]]. A [[closed-loop controller]] uses feedback to control [[state (controls)|states]] or [[Negative feedback#Overview|output]]s of a [[dynamical system]]. Its name comes from the information path in the system: process inputs (e.g., [[voltage]] applied to an [[electric motor]]) have an effect on the process outputs (e.g., speed or torque of the motor), which is measured with [[sensor]]s and processed by the controller; the result (the control signal) is "fed back" as input to the process, closing the loop.

Closed-loop controllers have the following advantages over [[open-loop controller]]s:
* disturbance rejection (such as hills in the cruise control example above)
* guaranteed performance even with [[mathematical model|model]] uncertainties, when the model structure does not match perfectly the real process and the model parameters are not exact
* [[instability|unstable]] processes can be stabilized
* reduced sensitivity to parameter variations
* improved reference tracking performance

In some systems, closed-loop and open-loop control are used simultaneously. In such systems, the open-loop control is termed [[feed forward (control)|feedforward]] and serves to further improve reference tracking performance.

A common closed-loop controller architecture is the [[PID controller]].

==Classical vs modern==

A Physical system can be modeled in the "time domain", where the response of a given system is a function of the various inputs, the previous system values, and time. As time progresses, the state of the system and its response change. However, time-domain models for systems are frequently modeled using high-order differential equations which can become impossibly difficult for humans to solve and some of which can even become impossible for modern computer systems to solve efficiently.

To counteract this problem, classical control theory uses the [[Laplace transform]] to change an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the time domain into a regular algebraic polynomial in the transform domain. Once a given system has been converted into the transform domain it can be manipulated with greater ease.

[[Modern control theory]], instead of changing domains to avoid the complexities of time-domain ODE mathematics, converts the differential equations into a system of lower-order time domain equations called [[state space (control)|state equations]], which can then be manipulated using techniques from linear algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ogata|first1=Katsuhiko|title=Modern Control Systems|date=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-615673-4|page=2|edition=Fifth|quote=modern control theory, based on time-domain analysis and synthesis using state variables}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laplace transform==
{{main|Laplace transform}}

Classical control theory uses the Laplace transform to model the systems and signals. The Laplace transform is a frequency-domain approach for continuous time signals irrespective of whether the system is stable or unstable. The Laplace transform of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''(''t'')}}, defined for all [[real number]]s {{math|''t'' ≥ 0}}, is the function {{math|''F''(''s'')}}, which is a unilateral transform defined by
: &lt;math&gt;F(s) =\int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s'' is a [[complex number]] frequency parameter
: &lt;math&gt;s = \sigma + i \omega&lt;/math&gt;, with real numbers {{math|''σ''}} and {{math|''ω''}}.

==Closed-loop transfer function==
{{details|closed-loop transfer function}}
The output of the system ''y(t)'' is fed back through a sensor measurement ''F'' to the reference value ''r(t)''. The controller ''C'' then takes the error ''e'' (difference) between the reference and the output to change the inputs ''u'' to the system under control ''P''. This is shown in the figure. This kind of controller is a closed-loop controller or feedback controller.

This is called a single-input-single-output (''SISO'') control system; ''MIMO'' (i.e., Multi-Input-Multi-Output) systems, with more than one input/output, are common. In such cases variables are represented through [[coordinate vector|vectors]] instead of simple [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values. For some [[distributed parameter systems]] the vectors may be infinite-[[Dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] (typically functions).

[[File:simple feedback control loop2.svg|center|A simple feedback control loop]]

If we assume the controller ''C'', the plant ''P'', and the sensor ''F'' are [[linear]] and [[time-invariant]] (i.e., elements of their [[transfer function]] ''C(s)'', ''P(s)'', and ''F(s)'' do not depend on time), the systems above can be analysed using the [[Laplace transform]] on the variables. This gives the following relations:

: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = P(s) U(s)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;U(s) = C(s) E(s)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;E(s) = R(s) - F(s)Y(s).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''Y''(''s'') in terms of ''R''(''s'') gives

: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = \left( \frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)} \right) R(s) = H(s)R(s).&lt;/math&gt;

The expression &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)}&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the ''closed-loop transfer function'' of the system. The numerator is the forward (open-loop) gain from ''r'' to ''y'', and the denominator is one plus the gain in going around the feedback loop, the so-called loop gain. If &lt;math&gt;|P(s)C(s)| \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., it has a large [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] with each value of ''s'', and if &lt;math&gt;|F(s)| \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;, then ''Y(s)'' is approximately equal to ''R(s)'' and the output closely tracks the reference input.

==PID controller==
{{details|PID controller}}
The [[PID controller]] is probably the most-used feedback control design. ''PID'' is an initialism for ''Proportional-Integral-Derivative'', referring to the three terms operating on the error signal to produce a control signal. If ''u(t)'' is the control signal sent to the system, ''y(t)'' is the measured output and ''r(t)'' is the desired output, and tracking error &lt;math&gt;e(t)=r(t)- y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, a PID controller has the general form

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) =  K_P e(t) + K_I \int e(t)\text{d}t + K_D \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}e(t).&lt;/math&gt;

The desired closed loop dynamics is obtained by adjusting the three parameters &lt;math&gt; K_P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; K_I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; K_D&lt;/math&gt;, often iteratively by "tuning" and without specific knowledge of a plant model. Stability can often be ensured using only the proportional term. The integral term permits the rejection of a step disturbance (often a striking specification in [[process control]]). The derivative term is used to provide damping or shaping of the response. PID controllers are the most well established class of control systems: however, they cannot be used in several more complicated cases, especially if multiple-input multiple-output systems (MIMO) systems are considered.

Applying Laplace transformation results in the transformed PID controller equation

:&lt;math&gt;u(s) =  K_P e(s) + K_I \frac{1}{s} e(s) + K_D s e(s)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u(s) =  \left(K_P + K_I \frac{1}{s} + K_D s\right) e(s)&lt;/math&gt;

with the PID controller transfer function
:&lt;math&gt;C(s) = \left(K_P + K_I \frac{1}{s} + K_D s\right).&lt;/math&gt;
There exists a nice example of the closed-loop system discussed above. If we take

PID controller transfer function in series form

:&lt;math&gt;C(s) =  K \left(1 + \frac{1}{sT_i}\right)(1 + sT_d)&lt;/math&gt;

1st order filter in feedback loop

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \frac{1}{1 + sT_f}&lt;/math&gt;

linear actuator with filtered input

:&lt;math&gt;P(s) = \frac{A}{1 + sT_p}&lt;/math&gt;,   A = const

and insert all this into expression for closed-loop transfer function H(s), then tuning is very easy: simply put

:&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{A},   T_i = T_f,   T_d = T_p&lt;/math&gt;

and get H(s) = 1 identically.

For practical PID controllers, a pure differentiator is neither physically realisable nor desirable&lt;ref&gt;Ang, K.H., Chong, G.C.Y., and Li, Y. (2005). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1453566 PID control system analysis, design, and technology, ''IEEE Trans Control Systems Tech'', 13(4), pp.559-576].&lt;/ref&gt; due to amplification of noise and resonant modes in the system. Therefore, a phase-lead compensator type approach is used instead, or a differentiator with low-pass roll-off.

==Tools==

Classical control theory uses an array of tools to analyze systems and design controllers for such systems. Tools include the [[root locus]], the [[Nyquist stability criterion]], the [[Bode plot]], the [[gain margin]] and [[phase margin]].

==Inks and pigments==

The best distinction between inks and pigments is that ink is a colored liquid while pigments are colored particles suspended in a liquid.&lt;ref&gt;Kunjappu, Joy (March 2003). [http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2003/March/inkchemistry.asp ”Ink Chemistry.”]. Chemistry World. rsc.org&lt;/ref&gt;  Areas colored by pigments usually have multiple layers of pigments and other mediums.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; The most important aspect of preserving pigments and inks is to identify their composition.  Some techniques are not suitable for certain pigments and will do further harm.&lt;ref name="utexas1"&gt;[http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~cochinea/pdfs/a-baker-04-pigments.pdf Common Medieval Pigments.].

===Some examples of issues with pigments===

*[[Iron gall ink]] – very popular black ink; corrosive; can become brittle and fade.&lt;ref&gt;Quandt, Abigail B. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v15/bp15-14.html “Recent Developments in the Conservation of Parchment Manuscripts.”] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/ ‘’The Book and Paper Group ANNUAL’’] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v15/ 15, 1996.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lead white – darkens when exposed to air; reacts with verdigris and orpiment; generally stable to light.
*[[Orpiment]] – loses color quickly with exposure to [[ozone]]; decays slowly in water; dissolves in [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sodium hydroxide]]; reacts with lead- and copper-based pigments (such as lead white and verdigris); can corrode bindings; will not easily adhere to parchment and tend to flake off; cannot readily be consolidated with gelatin.
*[[Ultramarine]] – very stable to light but very unstable with [[acids]]; becomes [[friable]] and will crumble if outer skin is scraped, although this is hard to see at first without the aid of a microscope and can be made worse with the application of [[gelatin]] or other liquid consolidators.
*[[Verdigris]] – reacts with lead white and orpiment; decays parchment; tends to become friable and is not easily treated with gelatin or other liquid consolidators; [[chelate|chelating]] agents such as [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] appear to prevent further degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638574|title=Some Aspects of Degradation Phenomena of Paper Caused by Green Copper-Containing Pigments|url=http://web.me.com/elandbas/papier_sem-4/groenvraat_files/IPC%2082%2007%2001.pdf|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume= 7|pages=3–7|year=1982 |author1=Banik, Gerhard |author2=Ponahlo, Johann }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification===

Identifying specific pigments is no easy task.  Descriptions may be wrong or misleading and choosing the wrong treatment may cause irreversible damage.&lt;ref name=r2&gt;Brown, Michelle P. “Pigments and their Uses in Insular Manuscripts”, in: ''Roger Powell: The Compleat Binder''; edited by John L. Sharpe. (Bibliologia; 14: Elementa ad librorum studia pertenentia''), 1996, pp. 136–45 {{ISBN|2503504345}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different ways to identify pigments: invasive and non-invasive.

;Invasive
These tests alter the manuscript in some way, usually by removing some pigment to test a sample.  They are generally reliable but results are not always clear.&lt;ref name="utexas1"/&gt;

;Non-Invasive

These tests do not alter the manuscript and are much better for conservation purposes than the invasive methods of identification.  Some methods include:

*[[Microscopes]]
*Observation under [[Ultra violet|UV]], [[Infrared|IR]], and [[visible light]]
*[[X-ray fluorescence|X-ray fluorescence (XRF)]]
*[[PIXE|Particle induced x-ray emission (PIXE-α)]]
*[[Raman spectroscopy]]

;Raman spectroscopy

Raman spectroscopy analyzes the [[molecular vibration]]s of the pigments and uses this data to map out its chemical makeup.&lt;ref &lt;ref name=r2/&gt; This works on the notion that every substance interacts with radiation in different ways, and these differing ways if measured can help identify the substance without having to take a sample. Unlike other non-invasive identification techniques the results of Raman spectroscopy are much more certain.  It is even possible to analyze a pigment beneath a glaze or other treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638581|title=Laser Raman Spectroscopy: a tool for non-destructive pigment analysis of manuscripts|year=1992|last1=Porter|first1=Cheryl|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties of parchment==

Parchment is [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic.]]  As such, environmental conditions such as [[relative humidity|humidity]] must be kept under control.  Pigments add another layer to the problem, forcing a preservationist to fit environmental conditions to two different (and possibly conflicting) sets of ideal limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638571|title=Rediscovering Parchment: the nature of the beast|year=1992|last1=Clarkson|first1=Christopher|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems can occur when parchment is exposed to high humidity for a long period of time. For example, [[collagen]] in the pages could dissolve and stick together.&lt;ref&gt;Mowery, J. Franklin. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v10/bp10-12.html “The Conservation of a Thirteenth Century Armenian Manuscript.”] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/ ''The Book and Paper Group ANNUAL''] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v10/ 10, 1991.]&lt;/ref&gt;

These problems are further compounded by the fact that pigments do not dye parchment; instead, they lie on the surface of the parchment and so are rather fragile.  Pressing an illuminated manuscript pushes the pigment down, altering the image itself and likely causing damage (such as a relief effect to the other side of the page) so it is very important to not put any pressure upon images on parchment, especially when it is wet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638576|title=The Vellum of the Book of Kells|year=1992|last1=Cains|first1=Anthony|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This fact also has to be taken into account when cleaning dirt from the image and when encapsulating or framing illuminated parchment for an exhibition.  There must be enough room between the image and the protective surface (such as [[Perspex]]) that the image will not be subject to rubbing if the parchment should expand with rising humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638579|title=Alternative Methods of Mounting Parchment for Framing and Exhibition|year=1992|last1=Pickwoad|first1=Nicholas|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of repair==

===Consolidation===

Consolidation is a process that can either strengthen the bond between pigment and parchment or add protection to pigments and other finishes from [[aqueous]] treatments.  Strengthening the bond between pigments and parchment help prevent the pigments from flaking and pulling away.  The challenge comes with achieving the best consolidation results while altering the object as little as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Maheux, Anne F., and Wanda McWilliams. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v14/bp14-03.html “The Use of the Ultrasonic Mister for the Consolidation of a Flaking Gouache Painting on Paper.] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/ ‘’The Book and Paper Group ANNUAL’’] [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v14/ 14, 1995.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The material used for consolidation should be appropriate for the pigments, the parchment, and any other aspects that may be affected by the application.&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;Quandt, Abigail B. [http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/sg/bpg/annual/v15/bp15-14.html “Recent Developments in the Conservation of Parchment Manuscripts.”]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soluble [[nylon]] was used until the mid-1970s when concerns over the material’s stability emerged.  Parchment size was then favored until the mid-1990s when leaf [[gelatin]] gained popularity.  This is not to say that gelatin is always the best consolidant to use; no consolidation technique should be used without first considering the pigments and other materials involved, though.  For example, gelatin causes white lead to become [[friability|friable.]]  This problem is compounded by the flexible nature of parchment.  One solution to this particular problem is to use some form of a cellulose ether such as [[methylcellulose]], instead of gelatin.  Again, this is not necessarily the right choice for every situation.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

There are a few basic requirements for any consolidation agent:
*It has to cause a strong bond to form between the pigment and parchment;
*A strong bond also has to be formed between the layers of pigments and any loose particles;
*There has to be little alteration of the chemicals, including appearance;
*It cannot cause the parchment to lose flexibility.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

====Ultrasonic mister====

One device recently used in consolidation techniques is the ultrasonic mister.  Created in 1991 by Stefan Michalski, this device lends itself well to consolidating materials that react badly with liquids.  Gelatin is the preferred consolidant.

The ultrasonic mister is usually used in conjunction with a paper suction table to direct the mist at the media and prevent [[distortion]].  This is not the best treatment for illuminated manuscripts that have printing on both sides, though.  In this case it is better to forgo the suction table and instead use the lowest setting on the mister and to monitor the process carefully.

Problems may arise if condensed mist falls onto the parchment from the nozzle so it is advisable that the device be placed on the floor or a similarly low level to coax mist to drain back into the mister instead of falling upon the parchment.&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

===Flattening and crease removal===

Traditional methods of removing creases and flattening parchment through humidifying have been detrimental to the state of any pigments, causing them to come off the parchment slightly.  This is because the parchment and pigments take on and give off moisture at different rates, causing them to expand and contract at varying rates and thus loosening the pigment from the surface.  This results in flaking, cupping, and cracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638572|title=A Conditioning Chamber for Parchment and Other Materials|year=1992|last1=Clarkson|first1=Christopher|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gore-Tex===

The question becomes whether flattening creased parchment to some extent will cause more or less damage to the image than would be caused by not removing the crease.  Sometimes not flattening the parchment in some respect will lead to the further degradation of an image.  In these cases some form of hydration is necessary.  Due to the nature of pigments, though, it is desirable to avoid direct contact with liquid water.  This can be accomplished with [[Gore-Tex]].

Gore-Tex now has controllable pore size and can block out many liquids, including liquid water and many conservation chemicals.  Water vapor can still pass through the pores, though, so it is possible to hydrate the parchment and remove a crease without introducing liquid water to the pigmented image.  This can be achieved by sandwiching a manuscript in Gore-Tex in varying ways to achieve the desired results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1992.9638574|title=The Conservation of Parchment Objects Using Gore-Tex Laminate|year=1992|last1=Singer|first1=Hannah|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=16|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mending===

Repairing a tear in a parchment with images or text on it is more of a challenge than mending a piece of parchment that does not have any such issues.  Care must be taken to not cover up or obscure in any way the image or the text.  Materials such as [[Goldbeater's skin]] can be made transparent enough to do this but great care still needs to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/03094227.1995.9638409|title=Leafcasting with Dermal Tissue Preparations: a new method for repairing fragile parchment, and its application to the Codex Eyckensis|year=1995|last1=Wouters|first1=Jan|last2=Peckstadt|first2=An|last3=Watteeuw|first3=Lieve|journal=The Paper Conservator|volume=19|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
The ethics of illuminated manuscript preservation involve the potential for adversely altering the source material during the course of the repair work. In order to ensure the integrity of the manuscript, great care must be taken during any preservation activity. Risk assessments should be made to determine the potential impact of preservation work on the manuscript, and weigh that against the potential benefits of the restoration work itself.

==In Depth on Conservation Challenges==
The Illuminated Book: Conserving an Art Form

The term illuminated manuscript comes from two sources, both of which originated in Medieval Latin.  The first is manuscriptus, a combination of manu ‘by hand’ and scriptus ‘written’.  The second is the Latin word illuminare, which translates to ‘adorned’.  It is this second term that immediately catches attention, letting readers know that this particular manuscript is special, illuminated or ‘adorned.’  An illuminated manuscript is a book, usually religious in nature, that has been intricately decorated with paints, inks, and metal leaf such as gold and silver.  This can include full page illustrations, intricate initials at the beginning of paragraphs and chapters, and embellishment to particularly important areas of text.  A surprising number of these books have survived the years to exist in the modern era; mostly thanks to their value and, in many cases, religious significance.  Nonetheless, the very embellishments that allowed these books to survive are the reason that today’s conservators find illuminated manuscripts more challenging to maintain than their plain counterparts.  This is important not just to conservators, but to the historians who rely on them to trace the economic trends and artistic evolution in a time that is commonly referred to as the Dark Ages, or more properly known as the Migration Period (476–800 C.E.).  Thousands of illuminated manuscripts have survived the ages, yet many are slowly being lost today because they are not being properly conserved.  Illuminated manuscripts are some of the hardest books to conserve, but every effort must be made to preserve them not only for their own beauty and value but for their historical significance as some of the only surviving written records of an era.

Part of the complexity of illuminated manuscripts lies in their historical context.  An illuminated manuscript is, in simple terms, a decorated book.  They usually contain both painted illustrations, embellished text, and illumination with gold and other precious metals.  With the advent and propagation of Christianity in medieval Europe, illustrated books rapidly became a way to convey religious teachings in a time when most of the population was illiterate.  Because of this purpose, most of the illuminated manuscripts to have survived the ages are religious in nature.  In most cases, rich patrons or churches would commission the creation of their own copies of various religious scriptures.  These were most commonly complete copies of the Bible or a subsection, such as individual books of the Old Testament, collections of 150 psalms, or collections of the first four books of the New Testament (Anderson 9).  In later cases, when more people could read, books of hours were also widely called for.   All of these books were created by either nuns or monks, usually in a scriptorium connected to their church or abbey.  Outside of the church, there were some examples of secular texts being illuminated.  Astronomical treatises and copies of classical writers were some of the first examples, emerging as the trend of owning personal copies of religious texts spread among the wealthy.  Later, histories and chronicles became more popular, coinciding with the gradual spread of knowledge and the founding of universities throughout Europe in the latter part of the Middle Ages (Anderson 13).  These books were still most often produced by church scribes and illuminators; however, they were commissioned by private citizens or universities rather than the church.  Without the illuminated manuscripts historians have to study today, much of this information about the gradual return of wealth and learning in the Migration Period would be difficult or even impossible to accurately trace and date.
There were many reasons for the creation of illuminated manuscripts, and these varied with each commission.  However, the most common were either for teaching purposes or as shows of wealth.  Because most common people were illiterate, they could only relate to stories of church doctrine through pictures rather than reading the words.  Illustrating religious texts allowed people to see the stories that church leaders read to them, and to create a personal connection outside of the oral tradition.  In this instance, illuminated manuscripts served the same purpose as stained glass windows in churches.  They allowed the faithful to see the stories of their faith, lending them substance that might be absent from the spoken word.  They could also serve as reminders of religious faith when a church service was not in progress.  The second reason for the creation of illuminated manuscripts was as a show of wealth.  In the case of church manuscripts, the books could both tell religious stories and remind the people of the power and wealth of the church.  In the case of private commissions, the patron was able to demonstrate their wealth by purchasing lavish volumes for their personal libraries and chapels.  This also served to demonstrate their fidelity to and strengthen their ties with the church, whose support and influence with the common people played a major part in keeping the upper class in power.  Because all but the very smallest of local churches had at least a plain copy of the bible, the range from completely unadorned manuscripts to the lavish and intricate designs embellished with rich gold leaf seen in the more famous versions of the art are clearly represented.  Where each book fell on this range closely reflected the wealth and influence of its owner, whether that was an upper-class individual or a town.  While this influence is also represented in buildings and other archeological evidence such as coinage and works of art, the prevalence of illuminated manuscripts from different areas and time periods provides a sort of historical litmus test to the prosperity of the region.

Before the invention of the printing press, making even the simplest book was a painstaking process.  The paper was made by hand, the leather was prepared in tanneries, the binding threads were hand spun, and the inks were ground with a mortar and pestle.  Even with all the materials assembled, the book still had to be stitched and glued together, then painstakingly written by hand by a scribe.  Even so, hundreds of thousands of books were produced between the transition from papyrus scrolls to codices and the advent of the printing press.  The initial transition that sparked this production occurred over time between the first and fifth centuries A.D.  The transition from scrolls to codices began from a common tool used by merchants, the wax tablet.  These tablets were simple panels covered in wax, which could be written in with a pointed stylus and then wiped clean again for reuse.  They were normally kept together by rings passed through holes in their sides (Anderson 17).  Once the format of a rectangular codex protected by hard or stiff covers had become a commonly known alternative to the scroll form previously used, it rapidly gained popularity for its durability and versatile applications.  Over time, they became the standard form of written information.  Gradually the intricate designs of tooled covers and decorated pages evolved to appeal to wealthy clients, and the books became an art form in and of themselves.  Of these carefully created books, only about five percent were deemed important enough to be decorated with illustrations and illumination (Anderson 7).  

To understand the challenges conservators face when dealing with these intricately decorated books, it is first necessary to understand how they were made.  Bookbinders used some of the same techniques used today to create hand bound books.  Sheets were folded in half, so that each one would form two pages.  These were then nested one inside the other to create a gathering.  These gatherings could include as many pages as the bookbinder chose, however there were usually relatively few to prevent the gathering from becoming too bulky.  An alternative method was to fold a very large sheet of paper repeatedly to create many pages, then slit three of the four sides with a knife to create a sheaf of pages (Hamel 39).  Many gatherings were sown together though pre-punched holes known as sowing stations.  The pattern of sowing stations and the use of the thread was what determined the structure of the binding.  Because scribes and artists often needed access to the entire sheets of paper to do their work, books from this time period were often prepared in loose bindings that could be easily undone to free a sheet of paper (Hamel 40).  For both illuminated and unadorned books, these loose bindings cause problems for conservators when they have not been properly and firmly bound after the writing and decorating was completed.  Entire gatherings of pages can come loose, needing to be carefully re-stitched into their correct locations.  Because of the wide variance in materials used in the bindings of books from the era that illuminated manuscripts were made, it is possible to trace some back to specific binderies, meaning that the materials can be analyzed to understand what trade was going on in that area at the time.  For example, if a lavish cover was inlayed with lapis lazuli, if would be possible to infer that the bindery was able to source materials from as far east as Afghanistan (Alexander 40).  Certain kinds of leather can also be traced back to specific geographical regions, as some breeds of cow and goat were only found in specific areas at this time.

The pages used in books from this period also pose their own concerns.  There were three main materials used for the pages of books in this time period: papyrus, parchment or vellum, and paper (Alexander 35).  Papyrus was the primary writing material of the ancient world, and was created by beating stalks of the papyrus reed together until the fibers in the plant formed a tight, almost woven structure.  Because it did not provide a stable surface for paint, this sort of paper was very rarely used for illuminated manuscripts.  As for the paper most people would recognize today, the first true example was created in China around 105 A.D. using beaten, strained, and dried vegetable fibers such as tree bark.  However, this paper was very expensive and generally had to be imported at the time that illuminated manuscripts were being widely made, so it appears less often than the third alternative, parchment (Permanence/Durability of the Book 11).  It is worth noting that those manuscripts with paper pages are much harder to conserve, and the acids present in the plant fibers naturally cause it to yellow and break down over time.  This process is irreversible, but can be slowed and limited by controlling the temperature, humidity, and light exposure of the paper.  Turning to the final option, we reach the most common form of page used in illuminated manuscripts.  Parchment and vellum are both made of very fine, prepared and treated animal skins that have been dried in a manner which leaves them flexible.  The difference between them is that vellum is usually made with either goat, pig, or calf skin, while parchment is made from sheep skin (Langwell 44).  Parchment provides an ideal surface for illumination, and was even placed into books which used other page materials in patches to allow for a good painting or illuminating surface (Alexander 35).  This prevalent use of parchment provides some of the historical significance of illuminated manuscripts.  The different kinds of hide used can be DNA tested with modern equipment, and often tell historians what area the book is from and sometimes where the hide was sourced from, mapping trade routes and patterns otherwise lost to history.  There is one key conservation problem with parchment and vellum that was discovered even while it was being widely used: if is very susceptible to water damage.  Not only does it mold quickly in high humidity environments, but early forms of ink that were commonly used on papyrus could simply be washed off without leaving a trace.  It is believed that “Iron gall inks were devised to overcome this disadvantage,” however even these inks can be wiped off fairly thoroughly if they are scrubbed (Langwell 43).

The issue of proper inks used on parchment also carries over to the paints used in the illustrations.  This set of problems is truly unique to decorated books, and is the beginning of just what sets them apart as conservation challenges as opposed to their plain counterparts.  In particular, the brilliant blue color of paint that is seen in many of the finest examples of the art is a challenge.  Made from ground lapis lazuli this was the most expensive color of paint, as it was sourced from far away Afghanistan (Alexander 40).  Any book bearing this color would have been especially costly, and helps to map the economic structure of Migration Period Europe through the supply chain used to create it and the person wealthy enough to afford it.  Unfortunately, this particularly precious color is also the most difficult for conservators.  It is prone to flaking and cupping, a form of contraction which causes the paint to crack and curve outwards in many little flakes, giving the appearance of tiny shingles that have been flipped upside-down.  This means that even the slightest friction can catch the raised edges and cause the paint to flake off.  It must be carefully consolidated with a nonreactive adhesive, without damaging other surrounding decoration (Clarkson 47).  Many other paints used at the time were also poisonous.  The compositions of many paints were discovered using Raman spectroscopy, a noninvasive method of analysis that bounces light off of a given pigment and reads back the compositions based on witch wavelengths are absorbed and reflected (De 75).  Using this and other spectroscopic methods, it has been determined that the very common red pigment found in these books was created from red lead, or, more dangerously, the highly toxic compound cinnabar.  Another variant of this common color was vermillion, created using heated mercury and sulfur.  Yellow was often made using poisonous orpiment, or arsenic sulfide, and white was almost invariably created using lead.  While there are some organic alternatives, such as yellow made from saffron, it is unknown if even a single illuminated manuscript does not contain toxic materials.  These compounds can pose a danger to conservators, researchers, or those putting the books of display if they are aerated and should be carefully consolidated and never abraded.  While many other paints and inks were used by the artist decorating the books, these examples convey both the wide ranges of the colors used and the dangers they posed. This added level of difficulty is a good example of what makes illuminated manuscripts harder to deal with than plan books.  It is also worth noting that while the paints were a finishing measure for the book the painter did not actually do any designing.  An earlier drawling would have set out the pattern and clearly labeled with colors should go where in places that would be covered with paint.  These patterns and labels are visible using various imaging techniques.  Some scribes also wrote or made small drawings in the margins of the books, often providing historians with a window into the life on the average man in the Migration Period. These little annotations are some of the only surviving records of everyday life from the time commonly known as the Dark Ages.  Complaints about long work hours and little drawings of people and monsters can be seen both in the margins and in some cases under the paint of the illustrations.  

The tradition of illustrating texts goes all the way back to the cradle of civilization, evolving through Egypt and the cultures of the Mediterranean.  However, it was far less common for books and papers to be embellished with precious metals, and this aspect of illuminated manuscripts adds another facet of difficulty for conservators that is not found elsewhere.  In the middle ages, gold was the symbol of royalty, a clear sign of wealth and status.  Yet for all of that, it was actually fairly common.  Indeed, by the late middle ages the most common use for gold was in coinage (De 65).  Because of this, using small quantities of the precious metal in a book was not prohibitively expensive.  Gold, and all other metals used for illumination, was hammered into incredibly thin sheets, allowing a tiny amount of gold to cover a large area.  This thin sheet was then adhered to the pages using the particular illuminator’s formula of adhesive.  This variation in adhesives mean that if any work needs to be done by a conservator, several tests must be undergone to ensure that no modern consolidation or adhesive will react with, damage, or loosen the old glue.  While this is an issue for conservators, in rare cases a glue can be traced to a specific bindery, thus placing the book in its correct area and context, making it far more useful to historians.  Another challenge for conservators lies in the fact that the gold used in books was not always pure.  Alloys of gold can be subject to corrosion, with can cause darkening of the metal, reaction with the adhesives and other paint, and staining of the paper.  This is an inherent vice of illuminations done with pure silver as well.  Regardless of the care and treatment, silver corrodes and darkens over time.  While modern conservators have ways of limiting this though control of humidity, older books have often seen their illumination corrode to the point that to attempt to clean it would simply remove the metal entirely.

Conservation in the modern era does not only face issues with the objects themselves.  While a corroded book is one issue, how to display that book to the public is another, potentially more complex problem.  From a conservator’s point of view, to best protect a book it should be placed in a controlled, dark environment, then swaddled in padding with plenty of circulating air and tightly controlled relative humidity.  Once old damage has been repaired, the goal is to keep new damage from occurring.  However, most illuminated manuscripts belong to museums and libraries.  Moreover, these beautiful works are the pride of the collection in most cases, and any curator will naturally want their most enticing items on display to woo the visiting public.  In addition, part of the cultural value of the books is what they can teach us about the missing part of history commonly known as the Dark Ages.  Historians will often want to study and run tests on the books in hopes of learning something about the time and place they were made, such as what trade was present.  Thus comes one of the great ethical issues in the field of conservation, the problem of preservation versus access.  The question most often faced by conservators is how to display a book to the least damage for the longest time.  The light that enables visitors to see the books also breaks down the lignin structures in paper pages, fades paints, and embrittles leather.  The cradle that holds the book open for viewing may also strain the spine. These are only two of the myriad issues that must be addressed when dealing with these fragile books.  Even more arise when tests need to be run or a historian wants to handle a book.  Removing a sliver of paint for analysis by a mass spectrometer may reveal information about trade routes, but it also damages the book.  Likewise, inspecting the drawings and inscriptions in the margins provides a unique historical window, but a careless historian might touch the page and damage fragile and flaking paint.  Not all institutions have the funds to properly care for their collections either.  While a few famous examples claim the spotlight in major institutions, small museums, libraries, and religious centers put their own, smaller treasures on display to the public without the expertise of a conservator to aid them.

The complex challenges of illuminated manuscripts make them a uniquely troublesome medium for conservation.  Their illumination, adhesives, paints, inks, papers, and even their very bindings can pose issues ranging from toxic chemicals to lost pages.  Some of these issues are universal to book conservation.  The troubles with ink on parchment pages and of loose bindings can be found in any book contemporary to the Medieval and Migration Periods.  Yet illuminated manuscripts take these usual issues and add to them with poisonous paint, corroding metals, and uniquely challenging materials such as the luxuriously expensive yet eternally flaking lapis lazuli paint.  Illuminated manuscripts are also problematic because of their popularity amongst displays.  For these reasons and many others, illuminated manuscripts are clearly more challenging to conservators than their plainer contemporaries.  Hidden away in private collections and small institutions, some of these books are gradually falling into disrepair.  This fact is all the more important when you look past the aesthetic and monetary value of these books and realize that they are some of the only surviving written pieces from a time when there is so little historical information available that textbooks call it the Dark Ages.  In the future, as technology evolves, it may be possible to gradually bring the economy and social system of the Migration Period into the light by carefully analyzing these books.  This is why it is so important that they survive in the modern age; and why the difficulty of their care matters to everyone, weather they see a beautiful artwork or a historical road map in the glittering pages.
 
==Digital preservation==
Manuscript preservation may also take the form of digital archiving, which is particularly useful for vulnerable manuscripts and fragments susceptible to deterioration such as the burnt fragments extant from the [[Cotton library#Ashburnham House fire|Cotton library fire]] which have now been recorded using multispectral imaging by the [[British Library]].&lt;ref name=bl2017&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunning|first1=Andrew|title=Fragmentarium and the burnt Anglo-Saxon fragments|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2017/09/fragmentarium-and-the-burnt-anglo-saxon-fragments.html|website=British Library: Medieval Manuscripts|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fragmentarium]] (Digital Research Laboratory for Medieval Manuscript Fragments) is an online database which, since September 2017, preserves and collates fragments of medieval manuscripts making them available to researchers, collectors and historians worldwide. It is an international collaboration of major libraries and collections including the [[British Library]], [[Harvard]], [[Stanford]], [[Yale]] and the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fragmentarium - An international scholarly network that enables libraries, collectors, researchers and students to upload medieval manuscript fragments and to describe, transcribe and assemble them online.|url=http://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/newsletter/archive/issue-18.html#fragmentarium|website=E-Codices|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CILII697.JPG|thumb|200px|Inscription II 697 in the CIL: in the wall of a building in [[Cáceres, Spain]].]]
The '''''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum''''' ('''''CIL''''') is a comprehensive collection of ancient [[Latin]] [[inscription]]s. It forms an authoritative source for documenting the surviving [[epigraphy]] of [[classical antiquity]]. Public and personal inscriptions throw light on all aspects of Roman life and history. The ''Corpus'' continues to be updated in new editions and supplements.

CIL also refers to the organization within the [[Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] responsible for collecting data on and publishing the Latin inscriptions. It was founded in 1853 by [[Theodor Mommsen]] and is the first and major organization aiming at a comprehensive survey.

==Aim==
The ''CIL'' collects all Latin inscriptions from the whole territory of the [[Roman Empire]], ordering them geographically and systematically. The earlier volumes collected and published authoritative versions of all inscriptions known at the time—most of these had been previously published in a wide range of publications. The descriptions include images of the original inscription if available, drawings showing the letters in their original size and position, and an interpretation reconstructing abbreviations and missing words, along with discussion of issues and problems. The language of the ''CIL'' is Latin.

==Beginnings==
In 1847 a committee was created in [[Berlin]] with the aim of publishing an organized collection of Latin inscriptions, which had previously been described piecemeal by hundreds of scholars over the preceding centuries. The leading figure of this committee was [[Theodor Mommsen]]&lt;ref name="CILhistory"&gt;See the CIL site under External links below.&lt;/ref&gt; (who wrote several of the volumes covering [[Italy]]). Much of the work involved personal inspections of sites and monuments in an attempt to replicate the original as much as possible. In those cases where a previously cited inscription could no longer be found, the authors tried to get an accurate reading by comparing the versions of the published inscription in the works of previous authors who had seen the original. The first volume appeared in 1853.

==Current status==
The ''CIL'' presently consists of 17 volumes in about 70 parts, recording approximately 180,000 inscriptions. Thirteen supplementary volumes have plates and special indices.&lt;ref name="CILhistory"/&gt; The first volume, in two sections, covered the oldest inscriptions, to the end of the [[Roman Republic]]; volumes II to XIV are divided geographically, according to the regions where the inscriptions were found. The other volumes cover other topics. Volume XVII, for instance, is entirely devoted to [[milestone]]s. A volume XVIII is planned, which will contain the ''Carmina Latina Epigraphica'' (Latin verse inscriptions). A two-volume "Index of Numbers", correlating inscription numbers with volume numbers, was published in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Andreas|editor-last=Fassbender|year=2003|series=CIL Auctarium Series Nova|title=Index Numerorum|volume=Erster Band, Zweiter Band|isbn=3-11-017936-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften]] continues to update and reprint the ''CIL.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1976">The '''curvaton''' is a hypothetical [[elementary particle]] which mediates a [[scalar field]] in early universe [[cosmology]].   It can generate fluctuations during [[inflation]], but does not itself drive inflation, instead it generates curvature perturbations at late times after the [[inflaton field]] has decayed and the decay products have redshifted away, when the curvaton is the dominant component of the energy density. It is used to generate a flat spectrum of CMB perturbations in models of inflation where the potential is otherwise too steep or in alternatives to inflation like the pre-Big Bang scenario.

The model was proposed almost simultaneously in 2001 by three independent groups: [[Kari Enqvist]] and Martin S. Sloth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Enqvist &amp; Sloth|title=Adiabatic CMB perturbations in pre-big bang string cosmology|arxiv=hep-ph/0109214 | doi=10.1016/S0550-3213(02)00043-3|volume=626|journal=Nuclear Physics B|pages=395–409|bibcode=2002NuPhB.626..395E}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Wands]] and [[David H.

'''Directed panspermia''' is the deliberate transport of microorganisms in space to be used as [[introduced species]] on lifeless but [[Planetary habitability|habitable]] [[astronomical object]]s.

Historically, Shklovskii and Sagan (1966) and Crick and Orgel (1973) hypothesized that [[life]] on the Earth may have been seeded deliberately by other civilizations. Conversely, Mautner and Matloff (1979) and Mautner (1995, 1997) proposed that humanity should seed other planetary systems, [[protoplanetary disc]]s or star-forming clouds with [[microorganism]]s, to secure and expand our organic gene/protein lifeform. To avoid interference with local life, the targets may be young planetary systems where local life is unlikely. Directed panspermia can be motivated by [[biotic ethics]] that value the basic patterns of organic gene/protein life with its unique complexity and unity, and its drive for self-propagation.

Directed panspermia is becoming possible due to developments in [[solar sails]], precise [[astrometry]], the discovery of [[extrasolar planets]], [[extremophiles]] and microbial [[genetic engineering]]. [[Cosmological]] projections suggest that life in space can then have a  future.&lt;ref name = "CosmologicalFuture" &gt;{{Cite journal|last = Mautner |first = Michael N. | title = Life in the cosmological future: Resources, biomass and populations  | journal = Journal of the British Interplanetary Society | year = 2005 | volume = 58 | pages = 167–180 | url=http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFCosmologyJBIS2005Paper.pdf |bibcode = 2005JBIS...58..167M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "SeedingBook"&gt;{{Cite book | last =  Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Seeding the Universe with Life: Securing Our Cosmological Future | year = 2000 | location = Washington D. C. | isbn = 047600330X | publisher = Legacy Books (www.amazon.com) |  url = http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFSeedingtheUniverse2005Book.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and motivation ==
An early example of the idea of directed panspermia dates to the early [[science fiction]] work ''[[Last and First Men]]'' by [[Olaf Stapledon]], first published in 1930. It details the manner in which the last humans, upon discovering that the [[Solar System]] will soon be destroyed, send microscopic "seeds of a new humanity" towards potentially [[Planetary habitability|habitable]] areas of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Stapledon| first=Olaf| title=Last and first men|year=2008|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.|isbn=978-0486466828| pages=238|edition=Unabridged republ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 [[Iosif Shklovsky|Shklovskii]] and [[Carl Sagan|Sagan]] speculated that life on Earth may have been seeded through directed panspermia by other civilisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last  = Shklovskii | first  = I.

A possible objection is potential interference with local life at the targets, but targeting young planetary systems where local life, especially advanced life, could not have started yet, avoids this problem.&lt;ref name = "Mautner3 " /&gt;
 
Directed panspermia may be motivated by the desire to perpetuate the common genetic heritage of all terrestrial life. This motivation was formulated as [[biotic ethics]] that value the common gene/protein patterns of self propagation,&lt;ref name = "Mautner4"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Life-centered ethics and the human future in space | journal = Bioethics | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 433–440 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00688.x | pmid=19077128|url=http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFLifeCenteredBioethics2009Paper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as panbiotic ethics that aim to secure and expand life in the universe.&lt;ref name = "Mautner2" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner3" /&gt;

== Strategies and targets ==
Directed panspermia may be aimed at nearby young planetary systems such as Alpha PsA (25 ly ([[light-year]]s) away) and [[Beta Pictoris]] (63.4 ly), both of which show [[accretion disc]]s and signs of comets and planets. More suitable targets may be identified by space telescopes such as the [[Kepler mission]] that will identify nearby star systems with habitable [[astronomical object]]s. Alternatively, directed panspermia may aim at star-forming interstellar clouds such as [[Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex]] (427 ly), that contains clusters of new stars too young to originate local life (425 infrared-emitting young stars aged 100,000 to a million years). Such clouds contain zones with various densities (diffuse cloud &lt; dark fragment &lt; dense core &lt; protostellar condensation &lt; accretion disc)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mezger  | first = P. G. | title = The search for protostars using millimetre/submillimeter dust emission as a tracer | journal = Planetary Systems: Formation, Evolution and Detection | editors=B. F. Burke, J. H. Rahe and E. E. Roettger | pages = 208–220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that could selectively capture panspermia capsules of various sizes.

Habitable astronomical objects or habitable zones about nearby stars may be targeted by large (10&amp;nbsp;kg)  missions where microbial capsules are bundled and shielded. Upon arrival, microbial capsules in the payload may be dispersed in orbit for capture by planets. Alternatively, small microbial capsules may be sent in large swarms to habitable planets, [[protoplanetary discs]], or zones of various density in interstellar clouds. The microbial swarm provides minimal shielding but does not require high precision targeting, especially when aiming at large interstellar clouds.&lt;ref name = "SeedingBook" /&gt;

== Propulsion and launch ==
Panspermia missions should deliver microorganisms that can grow in the new habitats. They may be sent in 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; kg, 60 μm diameter capsules that allow intact atmospheric entry at the target planets, each containing 100,000 diverse microorganisms suited to various environments. Both for bundled large mass missions and microbial capsule swarms, [[solar sails]] may provide the most simple propulsion for interstellar transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Vulpetti | first1 = G. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = L. | last3 = Matloff | first3 = G. L. | title = Solar Sails : A Novel Approach to Interplanetary Flight | location = New York | publisher = Springer | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-387-34404-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    Spherical sails will avoid orientation control both at launch and at deceleration at the targets.  

For bundled shielded missions to nearby star systems, [[solar sail]]s with thicknesses of 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m and areal densities of 0.0001&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; seem feasible, and sail/payload mass ratios of 10:1 will allow exit velocities near the maximum possible for such sails. Sails with about 540&amp;nbsp;m radius and area of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can impart 10&amp;nbsp;kg payloads with interstellar cruise velocities of 0.0005&amp;nbsp;''c''  (1.5x10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s) when launched from 1&amp;nbsp;au (astronomical unit). At this speed, voyage to the Alpha PsA star will last 50,000&amp;nbsp;y, and to the Rho Opiuchus cloud, 824,000&amp;nbsp;years.

At the targets, the microbial payload would decompose into 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; (100 billion) 30&amp;nbsp;µm capsules to increase the probability of capture. In the swarm strategy to protoplanetary discs and interstellar clouds, 1&amp;nbsp;mm radius, 4.2x10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg microbial capsules are launched from 1&amp;nbsp;au using sails of 4.2x10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg with radius of 0.37&amp;nbsp;m and area of 0.42&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to achieve cruising speeds of 0.0005&amp;nbsp;''[[Speed of light|c]]''. At the target, each capsule decomposes into 4,000 delivery microcapsules of 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg and of 30&amp;nbsp;micrometer radius that allow intact entry to planetary atmospheres.&lt;ref name = "Anders"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Anders | first = E. | title =  Prebiotic organic matter from comets and asteroids | journal = Nature | volume = 342 | pages =  255–257 | year = 1989 |bibcode = 1989Natur.342..255A |doi = 10.1038/342255a0 | issue=6247}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For missions that do not encounter dense gas zones, such as interstellar transit to mature planets or to habitable zones about stars, the microcapsules can be launched directly from 1 au using 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg sails of 1.8&amp;nbsp;mm radius to achieve velocities of 0.0005&amp;nbsp;''c'' to be decelerated by [[radiation pressure]] for capture at the targets. 
The 1&amp;nbsp;mm and 30&amp;nbsp;micrometer radius vehicles and payloads are needed in large numbers for both the bundled and swarm missions. These capsules and the miniature sails for swarm missions can be mass manufactured readily.

==Astrometry and targeting==
The panspermia vehicles would be aimed at moving targets whose locations at the time of arrival must be predicted. This can be calculated using their measured proper motions, their distances, and the cruising speeds of the vehicles. The positional uncertainty and size of the target object then allow estimating the probability that the panspermia vehicles will arrive at their targets.
The positional uncertainty δy (m) of the target at arrival time is given by equation (1), where α&lt;sub&gt;(p)&lt;/sub&gt; is the resolution of proper motion of the target object (arcsec/year), d is the distance from the Earth(m) and v is the velocity of the vehicle (m/s)&lt;ref&gt;Mautner, Michael N. Directed Panspermia. 3. Strategies and Motivations for Seeding Star-Forming Clouds. J. British Interplanetary
Soc. 1997, 50, 93-102&lt;/ref&gt;
:δy = 1.5×10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; α&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/v)
Given the positional uncertainty, the vehicles may be launched with a scatter in a circle about the predicted position of the target. The probability P&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; for a capsule to hit the target area with radius r&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; (m) is the given by the ratio of the targeting scatter and the target area.  
:P&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt;/π(δy)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4.4×10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; r&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(α&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;)        							
To apply these equations, the precision of astrometry of star proper motion of 0.00001 arcsec/year, and the solar sail vehicle velocity of 0.0005&amp;nbsp;''c'' (1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s) may be expected within a few decades. For a chosen planetary system, the area A&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; may be the width of the [[habitable zone]], while for interstellar clouds, it may be the sizes of the various density zones of the cloud.

==Deceleration and capture==
Solar sail missions to Sun-like stars can decelerate by [[radiation pressure]] in reverse dynamics of the launch. The sails must be properly oriented at arrival, but orientation control may be avoided using spherical sails. The vehicles must approach the target Sun-like stars at radial distances similar to the launch, about 1 au. After the vehicles are captured in orbit, the microbial capsules may be dispersed in a ring orbiting the star, some within the gravitational capture zone of planets.
Missions to accretion discs of planets and to star-forming clouds will decelerate by viscous drag at the rate dv/dt as determined by equation (3), where v is the velocity, rc the radius of the spherical capsule, ρc is density of the capsule and ρm is the density of the medium.        
: dv/dt =  -(3v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2ρ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) ρ&lt;sub&gt; m&lt;/sub&gt;/r&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; 
A vehicle entering the cloud with a velocity of 0.0005&amp;nbsp;''c'' (1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s) will be captured when decelerated to 2,000&amp;nbsp;m/s, the typical speed of grains in the cloud. 
The size of the capsules can be designed to stop at zones with various densities in the interstellar cloud. Simulations show that a 35 micron radius capsule will be captured in a dense core, and a 1&amp;nbsp;mm radius capsule in a protostellar condensation in the cloud. As for approach to accretion discs about stars, a millimetre size capsule entering the 1000&amp;nbsp;km thick disc face at 0.0005 ''c'' will be captured at 100&amp;nbsp;km into the disc. Therefore, 1&amp;nbsp;mm sized objects may be the best for seeding [[protoplanetary discs]] about new stars and protostellar condensations in interstellar clouds.&lt;ref name = "Mautner3" /&gt;

The captured panspermia capsules will mix with dust. A fraction of the dust and a proportional fraction of the captured capsules will be delivered to astronomical objects. Dispersing the payload into delivery microcapsules will increase the chance that some will be delivered to habitable objects. Particles of 0.6 - 60 micron radius can remain cold enough to preserve organic matter during atmospheric entry to planets or moons.&lt;ref name = "Anders " /&gt; Accordingly, each 1&amp;nbsp;mm, 4.2 ×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; kg capsule captured in the viscous medium can be dispersed into 42,000 delivery microcapsules of 30 micron radius, each weighing 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; kg and containing 100,000 microbes. These objects will not be ejected from the dust cloud by radiation pressure from the star, and will remain mixed with the dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |   last = Morrison | first = D. | title = Sizes and albedos of the larger asteroids | journal = Comets, Asteroids and Meteorites: Interrelations, Evolution and Origins, A.

A fraction of the dust, containing the captured microbial capsules, will be captured by planets or moons, or captured in comets and delivered by them later to planets. The probability of capture, P&lt;sub&gt;capture&lt;/sub&gt;, can be estimated from similar processes, such as the capture of interplanetary dust particles by planets and moons in our Solar System, where 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; of the Zodiacal cloud maintained by comet ablation, and also a similar fraction of asteroid fragments, is collected by the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Weatherill | first = G.

The probability of capture of an initially launched capsule by a planet (or astronomical object) P&lt;sub&gt;planet&lt;/sub&gt; is given by the equation below, where P&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; is the probability that the capsule reaches the target accretion disc or cloud zone, and P&lt;sub&gt;capture&lt;/sub&gt; is the probability of capture from this zone by a planet. 
: P&lt;sub&gt;planet&lt;/sub&gt; = P&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; × P&lt;sub&gt;capture&lt;/sub&gt;
The probability P&lt;sub&gt;planet&lt;/sub&gt; depends on the mixing ratio of the capsules with the dust and on the fraction of the dust delivered to planets. These variables can be estimated for capture in planetary accretion discs or in various zones in the interstellar cloud.

==Biomass requirements==
After determining the composition of chosen [[meteorite]]s, [[Astroecology|astroecologists]] performed laboratory experiments that suggest that many colonizing microorganisms and some plants could obtain most of their chemical nutrients from [[asteroid]] and [[comet]]ary materials.&lt;ref name=bioresources&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Planetary bioresources and astroecology. 1. Planetary microcosm bioessays of Martian and meteorite materials: soluble electrolytes, nutrients, and algal and plant responses|journal = Icarus |volume = 158 | pages = 72–86 |  year = 2002 | doi=10.1006/icar.2002.6841 | bibcode=2002Icar..158...72M | url = http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFBioresourcesIcarus2002Paper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scientists noted that phosphate (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[nitrate]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;–N) critically limit nutrition to many terrestrial lifeforms.&lt;ref name=bioresources/&gt; For successful missions, enough [[biomass]] must be launched and captured for a reasonable chance to initiate life at the target astronomical object. An optimistic requirement is the capture by the planet of 100 capsules with 100,000 microorganisms each, for a total of 10 million organisms with a total biomass of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; kg.

The required biomass to launch for a successful mission is given by following equation. 
m&lt;sub&gt;biomass&lt;/sub&gt; (kg) = 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; / P&lt;sub&gt;planet&lt;/sub&gt;     
Using the above equations for P&lt;sub&gt;target&lt;/sub&gt; with transit velocities of 0.0005 c, the known distances to the targets, and the masses of the dust in the target regions then allows calculating the biomass that needs to be launched for probable success. With these parameters, as little as 1&amp;nbsp;gram of biomass (10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; microorganisms) could seed Alpha PsA and 4.5&amp;nbsp;gram could seed Beta Pictoris. More biomass needs to be launched to the [[Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex]], mainly because its larger distance. A biomass on the order of 300 tons would need to be launched to seed a protostellar condensation or an accretion disc, but two hundred kilograms would be sufficient to seed a young stellar object in the [[Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex]].

Consequently, as long as the required [[Life#Range of tolerance|physical range of tolerance]] are met (e.g.: growth temperature, cosmic radiation shielding, atmosphere and gravity), lifeforms viable on Earth may be chemically nourished by watery asteroid and planetary materials in this and other planetary systems.&lt;ref name=bioresources/&gt;

==Biological payload==
The seeding organisms need to survive and multiply in the target environments and establish a viable [[biosphere]]. Some of the new branches of life may develop intelligent beings who will further expand life in the galaxy.
The messenger microorganisms may find diverse environments, requiring [[extremophile]] microorganisms with a range of tolerances, including thermophile (high temperature), psychrophile (low temperature), acidophile (high acidity), halophile (high salinity), oligotroph (low nutrient concentration), xerophile (dry environments) and radioresistant (high radiation tolerance) microorganisms. [[Genetic engineering]] may produce polyextremophile microorganisms with several tolerances.    
The target atmospheres will probably lack oxygen, so the colonizers should include [[anaerobic microorganisms]]. Colonizing anaerobic [[cyanobacteria]] may later establish atmospheric oxygen that is needed for higher [[evolution]], as it happened on Earth. Aerobic organisms in the biological payload may be delivered to the astronomical objects later when the conditions are right, by comets that captured and preserved the capsules.

The development of [[eukaryote]] microorganisms was a major bottleneck to higher evolution on Earth. Including eukaryote microorganisms in the payload can bypass this barrier. Multicellular organisms are even more desirable, but being much heavier than bacteria, fewer can be sent. Hardy [[tardigrades]] (water-bears) may be suitable but they are similar to [[arthropods]] and would lead to insects. The body-plan of [[rotifers]] could lead to higher animals, if the rotifers can be hardened to survive interstellar transit.

Microorganisms or capsules captured in the accretion disc can be captured along with the dust into asteroids. During aqueous alteration the asteroids contain water, inorganic salts and organics, and [[astroecology]] experiments with meteorites showed that algae, bacteria, fungi and plant cultures can grow in the asteroids in these media.&lt;ref name = "Bioresources2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Planetary resources and astroecology.

Microorganisms can then spread in the accreting solar nebula, and will be delivered to planets in comets and in asteroids. The microorganisms can grow on nutrients in the carrier comets and asteroids in the aqueous planetary environments, until they adapt to the local environments and nutrients on the planets.&lt;ref name = bioresources/&gt;&lt;ref name = " Bioresources2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Olsson-Francis | first = Karen | last2 = Cockell | first2 = Charles S. | title = Use of cyanobacteria for in-situ resource use in space applications | journal = Planetary and Space Science | volume = 58 | issue = 10 | pages = 1279–1285 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.pss.2010.05.005 | bibcode=2010P&amp;SS...58.1279O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signal in the genome===
A number of publications since 1979 have proposed the idea that directed panspermia could be demonstrated to be the origin of all life on Earth if a distinctive 'signature' message were found, deliberately implanted into either the [[genome]] or the [[genetic code]] of the first microorganisms by our hypothetical progenitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Message through time | author = G.

==Concept missions==
Significantly, panspermia missions can be launched by present or near-future technologies. However, more advanced technologies may be also used when these become available.   
The biological aspects of directed panspermia may be improved by [[genetic engineering]] to produce hardy polyextremophile microorganisms and multicellular organisms, suitable to diverse astronomical objects environments. Hardy polyextremophile anaerobic multicellular eukaryots with high radiation resistance, that can form a self-sustaining ecosystem with [[cyanobacteria]], would combine ideally the features needed for survival and higher evolution.

For advanced missions, [[ion thrusters]] or solar sails using [[beam-powered propulsion]] accelerated by Earth-based lasers can achieve speeds up to 0.01 ''c'' (3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m/s). [[Robots]] may provide in-course navigation, may control the reviving of the frozen microbes periodically during transit to [[DNA repair|repair radiation damage]], and may also choose suitable targets. These propulsion methods and robotics are under development.

Microbial payloads may be also planted on hyperbolic [[comets]] bound for interstellar space. This strategy follows the mechanisms of natural panspermia by comets, as suggested by Hoyle and Wikramasinghe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Hoyle | first1 = F. | last2 = Wickramasinghe | first2 = C. | title = Lifecloud: The Origin of Life in the Universe | location = London | publisher = J. M. Dent and Sons | year = 1978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The microorganisms would be frozen in the comets at interstellar temperatures of a few [[kelvin]]s and protected from radiation for eons. It is unlikely that an ejected comet will be captured in another planetary system, but the probability can be increased by allowing the microbes to multiply during warm [[perihelion]] approach to the Sun, then fragmenting the comet.  A 1&amp;nbsp;km radius comet would yield 4.2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; one-kg seeded fragments, and rotating the comet would eject these shielded icy objects in random directions into the galaxy. This increases a trillion-fold the probability of capture in another planetary system, compared with transport by a single comet.&lt;ref name = "SeedingBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner2" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner3" /&gt;  Such manipulation of comets is a speculative long-term prospect.

The German physicist [[Claudius Gros]] has proposed that the technology developed by the [[Breakthrough Starshot]] initiative may be utilized in a second step to establish a [[biosphere]] of [[unicellular organism|unicellular microbes]] on otherwise only transiently [[Planetary habitability|habitable]] [[astronomical object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Gros]]: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10509-016-2911-0 ''Developing Ecospheres on Transiently Habitable Planets: The Genesis Project''], Astrophysics and Space Science, Vol. 361, pp 1-14 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of this initiative, the Genesis project, would be to fast forward evolution to a stage equivalent of the [[precambrian]] period on Earth. Gros argues that the Genesis project would be realizable within 50-100 years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/author/jessica-boddy ''Jessica Boddy'']: [http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/qa-should-we-seed-life-alien-worlds ''Q&amp;A: Should we seed life on alien worlds?''], [[Science (journal)|Science]], 9. September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; using low-weight probes equipped with a miniaturized gene laboratory for the ''in situ'' [[artificial cell|cell synthesis]] of the microbes.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen Callaway: [http://www.nature.com/news/minimal-cell-raises-stakes-in-race-to-harness-synthetic-life-1.19633 ''Minimal cell raises stakes in race to harness synthetic life'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Genesis project extends directed panspermia to [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] life, arguing that it is more likely that complex life is rare, &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.astrobio.net/alien-life/complex-life-elsewhere-in-the-universe/ ''Complex Life Elsewhere in the Universe?'']&lt;/ref&gt; and not bacterial life.

==Motivation and ethics==
Directed panspermia aims to secure and expand our family of organic gene/protein life. It may be motivated by the desire to perpetuate the common genetic heritage of all terrestrial life. This motivation was formulated as [[biotic ethics]], that value the common gene/protein patterns of  organic life,&lt;ref name = "Mautner4" /&gt; and as panbiotic ethics that aim to secure and expand life in the universe.&lt;ref name = "Mautner2" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Mautner3" /&gt;

[[Molecular biology]] shows complex patterns common to all cellular life, a common [[genetic code]] and a common mechanism to [[Translation (biology)|translate]] it into [[protein]]s, which in turn help to reproduce the DNA code. Also, shared are the basic mechanisms of energy use and material transport. These self-propagating patterns and processes are the core of organic gene/protein life.   
Life is unique because of this complexity, and because of the exact coincidence of the laws of physics that allow life to exist.  Also unique to life is the pursuit of self-propagation, which implies a human purpose to secure and expand life. These objectives are best secured in space, suggesting a panbiotic ethics aimed to secure this future.&lt;ref name = "SeedingBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner2" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner3" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mautner4" /&gt;

==Objections and counterarguments==
The main objection to directed panspermia is that it may interfere with local life at the targets.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} The colonizing microorganisms may out-compete local life for resources, or infect and harm local organisms.  However, this probability can be minimized by targeting newly forming planetary systems, accretion discs and star-forming clouds, where local life, and especially advanced life, could not have emerged yet. If there is local life that is fundamentally different, the colonizing  microorganisms may not harm it. If there is local organic gene/protein life, it may exchange genes with the colonizing microorganisms, increasing galactic [[biodiversity]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
 
Another objection is that space should be left pristine for scientific studies, a reason for planetary quarantine. However, directed panspermia may reach only a few, at most a few hundred new stars, still leaving a hundred billion pristine for local life and for research.     
A technical objection is the uncertain survival of the messenger organisms during long interstellar transit. Research by simulations, and the development on hardy colonizers is needed to address this questions.

A third argument against engaging in directed panspermia derives from the view that wild animals do not —on the average— have lives worth living, and thus spreading life would be morally wrong. Ng supports this view,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ng |first=Y. |date=1995 |title=Towards welfare biology: Evolutionary economics of animal consciousness and suffering |url=http://stafforini.com/library/ng-1995.pdf |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=255–285 |doi=10.1007/bf00852469}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing mainly on the fact that almost all animal species have many more offspring than are needed to replace them. The large number of offspring implies that most of them will die before reaching reproductive age, providing only a short window of life before an often unpleasant death. Tomasik agrees,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last= Tomasik|first= Brian |date= 2015|title=The Importance of Wild-Animal Suffering.  |url=http://www.ledonline.it/index.php/Relations/article/view/880/717 |journal=Relations Beyond Anthropocentrism |volume=3 |issue=3  |doi= 10.7358/rela-2015-002-toma }}&lt;/ref&gt; but places significant weight on the extreme suffering many animals experience, especially at death. Plant responds in detail to Tomasik,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.plantinghappiness.co.uk/the-unproven-and-unprovable-case-for-wild-animal-suffering/ |title=The Unproven (And Unprovable) Case For Wild Animal Suffering |last=Plant |first= Michael}}  &lt;/ref&gt; arguing that because of the vast number of diverse species and the difficulty of rating animal pain and pleasure, we cannot determine if animals have lives worth living. If wild animal lives are overall negative in quality (with more suffering than pleasure), then spreading life through panspermia would be spreading needless pain. From this perspective, directed panspermia is to be strictly avoided, unless and until we can determine that the lives of the animals generated by it would average positive.

==In popular culture==

The discovery of an ancient directed panspermia effort is the central theme of "[[The Chase (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Chase]]," an episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. In the story, [[Captain Picard]] must work to complete the penultimate research of his late archaeology professor's career. That professor, Galen, had discovered that [[DNA]] fragments seeded into the primordial genetic material of 19 worlds could be rearranged to assemble a [[computer algorithm]]. Amid competition (and, later, with begrudging cooperation) from [[Cardassian]], [[Klingon]] and [[Romulan]] expeditions also exploring Galen's research clues, the ''[[U.S.S. Enterprise-D|Enterprise]]'' crew discovers that an alien progenitor race had indeed, [[Abiogenesis|4 billion years]] prior, seeded genetic material across many star systems, thus directing the evolution of many humanoid species.

The '''Economic Scholars Program''' (ESP) is an annual conference  in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] that highlights undergraduate research in economics and business.  It is co-hosted by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]] and [[Austin College]]. The conference is typically held on the last Friday in March or first Friday in April&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dallasfed.org/educate/events/esp.cfm | title=ESP About | publisher=Dallas Federal Reserve | accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is modeled after professional economics conferences. Undergraduate students participate in the conference as presenters of original or faculty-coauthored research, discussants, session chairs or audience member participants. Each level of participation in the program is designed to reflect the growing interests and skills of undergraduate students. Additionally, the ESP added a poster session in 2011 to accommodate more student research.

The 6th annual conference, held in 2012, hosted undergraduate students and faculty mentors representing 35 different undergraduate institutions from 19 states. In terms of the number of attendees, papers, and posters presented it is the largest conference focusing on undergraduate research in economics.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Hard-edge painting'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/h/hard-edge-painting Tate Glossary, Hard-edge painting] retrieved August 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is painting in which abrupt transitions are found between color areas. Color areas are often of one unvarying color.  The Hard-edge painting style is related to [[Geometric abstraction]], [[Op Art]], [[Post-painterly Abstraction]], and [[Color Field painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web] retrieved June 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the term==
The term was coined by writer, curator and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' art critic [[Jules Langsner]], along with [[Peter Selz]], in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt5v19r00h/ It was in 1959 that Langsner and art historian Peter Selz originated the phrase "hard-edge painting"] to describe the colors, shapes and style of abstract expressionist painting on the West Coast and in particular the works by [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]]&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the work of painters from [[California]], who, in their reaction to the more painterly or gestural forms of [[Abstract expressionism]], adopted a knowingly impersonal paint application and delineated areas of color with particular sharpness and clarity. This approach to abstract painting became widespread in the 1960s, though California was its creative center. 

Other, earlier, movements, or styles have also contained the quality of hard-edgedness, for instance the [[Precisionism|Precisionists]] also displayed this quality to a great degree in their work. Hard-edge can be seen to be associated with one or more school of painting, but is also a generally descriptive term, for these qualities found in any painting. Hard-edged painting can be both figurative or nonrepresentational.

In the late 1950s, Langsner and Peter Selz, then professor at the [[Claremont Colleges]], observed a common link among the recent work of [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]] (1898–1976), [[Lorser Feitelson]] (1898-1978), [[Karl Benjamin]] (1925-2012), [[Frederick Hammersley]] (1919–2009) and Feitelson's wife [[Helen Lundeberg]] (1908-1999). The group of seven gathered at the Feitelson's home to discuss a group exhibition of this nonfigurative painting style. Curated by Langsner, ''Four Abstract Classicists'' opened at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] in 1959. [[Helen Lundeberg]] was not included in the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/arts/design/07fink.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin ''Karl Benjamin’s Colorful Resurgence,'' accessed October 21, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; These painters were featured in a touring exhibition during 2008 called "The Birth of the Cool" in [[California]] museums along with midcentury [[design]], [[music]] and [[film]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumca.org/exhibit/exhi_cool.html "Birth of the Cool: California Art, Design, and Culture at Midcentury"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704055441/http://museumca.org/exhibit/exhi_cool.html |date=2008-07-04 }}, accessed July 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhibition===

''Four Abstract Classicists'' was subtitled ''California Hard-edge'' by British art critic and curator [[Lawrence Alloway]] when it traveled to England and Ireland. The term came into broader use after Alloway used it to describe contemporary American geometric abstract painting featuring "economy of form," "fullness of color," "neatness of surface," and the nonrelational arrangement of forms on the canvas.

In 1964, a second major hard-edge exhibition curated by Jules Langsner was held at the Pavilion Gallery in Balboa, CA (also known as the Newport Pavilion) with the cooperation of the Ankrum Gallery, Esther Robles Gallery, Felix Landau Gallery, [[Ferus Gallery]] and Heritage Gallery of [[Los Angeles]].  This was called, simply, ''California Hard-edge painting.'' Included in this show were Florence Arnold, [[John Barbour (artist)|John Barbour]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], Karl Benjamin, [[John Coplans]], Lorser Feitelson, Frederick Hammersley, June Harwood, [[Helen Lundeberg]], [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]], and Dorothy Waldman.

In 2000, Tobey C. Moss curated ''Four Abstract Classicists Plus One'' at her gallery in [[Los Angeles]]. The exhibit again featured John McLaughlin, Feitelson, Hammersley, and Benjamin, and added Lundeberg as the fifth of the original Hard-edge painters.  In 2003, [[Louis Stern Fine Arts]] showed a retrospective exhibition for Lorser Feitelson entitled ''Lorser Feitelson and the invention of Hard-edge painting, 1945-1965.''  The same year, NOHO MODERN showed the works of June Harwood in an exhibition entitled ''June Harwood: Hard-edge painting Revisited, 1959-1969.''  Art critic [[Dave Hickey]] solidified the place of these 6 artists in: ''The Los Angeles School: Karl Benjamin, Lorser Feitelson, Frederick Hammersley, June Harwood, Helen Lundeberg, and John McLaughlin.''  The exhibition was held at the Ben Maltz Gallery of the [[Otis Art Institute]] in [[Los Angeles]] in 2004-2005.

==The style==
This style of hard-edge geometric abstraction recalls the earlier work of [[Kasimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Theo van Doesburg]], and [[Piet Mondrian]]. Other artists associated with Hard-edge painting include [[Herb Aach]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Max Bill]], [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Herbert Busemann]], Ralph Coburn, [[Nassos Daphnis]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Robyn Denny]], [[Howard Mehring]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[John Ferren]], [[Peter Halley]], [[Al Held]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Günther C. Kirchberger]], [[Alexander Liberman]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[George L. K. Morris]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Deborah Remington]], [[Bridget Riley]], Ludwig Sander, [[David Simpson (artist)|David Simpson]], [[Leon Polk Smith]], [[Julian Stanczak]], [[Jeffrey Steele (artist)|Jeffrey Steele]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Myron Stout]], [[Leo Valledor]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Charmion von Wiegand]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[John Stephan]], [[Larry Zox]] and [[Barbro Östlihn]] .

[[File:Project Physics Text cover.jpg|thumb|''Project Physics'', cover, main text]]
'''Harvard Project Physics''', also called '''Project Physics''', was a national [[curriculum development]] project to create a [[secondary school]] [[physics education]] program in the United States during the [[Cold War]] era. 

==History==
The project was active from 1962 to 1972, and produced the ''Project Physics'' series of texts, which were used in physics classrooms in the 1970s and 1980s. The project was centered at [[Harvard University]], but drew from schools and educators from across the country. The directors of this project were: [[F. James Rutherford]], project coordinator (and after completion of the project, professor of [[science education]] at [[New York University]]); [[Gerald Holton]], professor of physics and of the [[history of science]] at Harvard University; and [[Fletcher Watson|Fletcher G. Watson]], professor of science education at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]].

==Course materials==
Project Physics course work was broken into six main subject areas, organized into separate books each called a "Project Physics Text and Handbook" or "Student Guide":&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/projectphysicscollection Project Physics Collection at Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

#Concepts of Motion
#Motion in the Heavens
#The Triumph of Mechanics
#Light and Electromagnetism
#Models of the Atom 
#The Nucleus

The books presented the material from a historical perspective, with aspects of human interest wrapped into the text. The intent was to build a sophisticated conceptual understanding of physics, while not over-simplifying the curriculum. Frequent references to historical works where concepts were first discovered and debated highlighted the drive to make physics a fundamental search for understanding of the universe.&lt;ref name="AOTS"&gt;{{cite web|title=High School Reform Projects: Physics|url=http://artofteachingscience.org/mos/5.2.html|website=artofteachingscience.org|accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The course materials also included readers, tests, and other teaching aids. The course readers allowed students to further explore a topic, and lab exercises enabled students to verify that their understanding was confirmed by experimental outcomes. Special lab equipment, brief film loops, films, and a teacher's guide were also developed.&lt;ref name="AOTS" /&gt; The texts and all other aids are now available for free on the Project Physics Collection web site.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''I quattro libri dell'architettura''''' (''The Four Books of Architecture'') is a treatise on [[architecture]] by the architect [[Andrea Palladio]] (1508–1580), written in [[Italian language|Italian]].  It was first published in four [[volume]]s in 1570 in [[Venice]], illustrated with woodcuts after the author's own drawings. It has been reprinted and translated many times, often in single-volume format.

Book I was first published in English in 1663 in a London edition by Godfrey Richards. The first complete English language edition was published in London by the Italian-born architect [[Giacomo Leoni]] in 1715-1720.&lt;ref&gt;The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., "Palladio and his Books." http://www.palladiancenter.org/palladiobooks.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==

The treatise is divided into four books:

The First book discusses building materials and techniques.  It documents five [[classical order]]s (Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, composite) in all their parts (bases, columns, architraves, arches, capitals, trabeations), as well as discussing other building elements (vaulted ceilings, floors, doors and windows, fireplaces, roofs and stairs).

The Second book covers the designs of private urban townhouses and country villas of the 1500s, in and around Venice, almost all designed by Palladio himself.  This includes nine palazzi, 22 villas (13 of them completed, another 5 partly completed), and a series of unrealized projects.  The plates of completed projects sometimes differ from the buildings as actually constructed.

The Third book addresses matters of city planning:  streets, stone street paving, bridges of both stone and wood, and piazzas, with examples drawn from Roman origins alongside contemporary examples; also basilicas, including the basilica designed by [[Vitruvius]] in [[Fano]] and the important [[Basilica Palladiana]] in Vicenza.

The Fourth book contains five chapters of general introduction, then 26 chapters, each of which describe the designs of specific Roman temples dating from antiquity, along with one contemporary church design.  (The exception is the [[San Pietro in Montorio]], designed by [[Donato Bramante]], consecrated in the year 1500.)  Palladio's selections range geographically from Rome, Naples, Spoleto, Assisi, Pola and Nîmes.  Illustrations of the temples include careful measurements of existing building elements, together with Palladio's own conjectural interpretations of the temple's facades where only fragments remained, as at the [[Temple of Trajan]].

The 26 temples discussed in include:

==Author==
Palladio founded an architectural movement which takes its name from him, [[Palladian architecture]]. ''I quattro libri dell'architettura'' contains Palladio's own designs celebrating the purity and simplicity of [[classical architecture]]. Some of these ideas had gotten no further than the drawing board while others, for example [[villa]] plans, had been successfully built. The book's clarity inspired numerous [[patron]]s and other architects.  Palladian architecture grew in popularity across [[Europe]] and, by the end of the 18th century, had extended as far as [[North America]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[President of the United States]], was a keen admirer of Palladio and once referred to the book as "the Bible". ''The Four Books'' was used to inform his own work as the architect of [[Monticello]] and the [[University of Virginia]] and also architect William Buckland's at the 1774 Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis, Maryland.

Palladio drew inspiration from surviving Roman buildings, Roman authors (especially the architect [[Vitruvius]]) and Italian Renaissance architects.  However, ''The Four Books of Architecture'' provided [[:wikt:systematic|systematic]] rules and plans for buildings which were creative and unique. Palladio's villa style is based on details applied to a structural system built of bricks. He offers two types of general rules in the corpus: design rules (those based on appearance) and construction rules (those based on the logic of villa construction). Here rules of the two types are identified in sets from which subsets of identifiers and rules can be written.

Each of the nine rule-sets contains many sub-identities of components and procedures for physical construction. A rule-set such as “Walls”, that identifies five sub-rules based on wall thickness, only needs construction rules; there is no need for rules based on style. In contrast, rules for “Frames” are based on a geometric style of curves and shape proportions. The results will yield clear identities for a shape [[grammar]] [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] that can be based on physical construction and visual style.

==Rule-sets==
These identities are taken from the first book of architecture and a survey of built villas. These are the nine rule-sets that define identity:[[Image:Villa Pisani.jpg|thumb|right|[[Villa Pisani (Bagnolo)]] in ''I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura'']]
#Walls — [[parametric equation|parametric]] [[formula]]
#Ceilings — parametric formula
#Stairs — parametric formula
#Columns — parametric object
#Doors — parametric formula
#Windows — parametric formula
#Frames — parametric object
#Roof — parametric formula

== Graduate degree programs ==

=== Structure ===

Records are listed alphabetically by university in descending order. Within a given university, records are sorted by degree (doctorate, then master's). Inclusion criteria are described on the [[Talk:List of schools for quantitative psychology#Inclusion Criteria|talk page]].
* '''University section'''
** '''University''' – The university listed is the primary institution/organization which grants the degree. The link provided links to the Wikipedia page for the university.
** '''Department''' – The department listed is the primary department which grants the degree. The link provided links to the department's website.
* '''Program section'''
** '''Terminal degree''' – This is the final degree granted to the student within that degree track. Many doctoral programs in the US have joint MA/Ph.D programs. Those degrees are listed within the same record under the final degree granted (''e.g.'', Doctorate of Philosophy). The link provided directs to the description of the degree.
** '''Program''' – This is the name of the degree program. The link typically directs to the degree requirements. Many times the Terminal Degree page and the Program page are the same.
** '''Specialty''' – This subsection identifies various tracks within a degree program. Not all programs have this level of specialty. If applicable, the link directs to the primary page detailing the specialization requirements.
** '''Faculty''' – This section lists the tenured/tenure-track faculty currently listed on the program's website with a primary appointment. Emeritus professors are excluded from this list.
* '''Source''' – The source lists the academic organization which identified the program as a quantitative program. Multiple organizations can be listed. See the [[Talk:List of schools for quantitative psychology#Inclusion Criteria|talk page]] for more details.

This is a '''list of types of funerary monument''', a physical structure that commemorates a deceased person or a group, in the latter case usually those whose deaths occurred at the same time or in similar circumstances. The funerary monument differs from a tomb or cemetery in that while it may or may not contain the body of the deceased, its primary purpose is not simply to house the remains, but to serve as a visible reminder of the dead for the living. It often features inscriptions ([[epitaph]]s) or [[funerary art]].

}}

'''Liudmila Grigorievna Kovnatskaya''' (born 5 February 1941) is a Russian musicologist. She is a professor at the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|St Petersburg State Conservatoire named after N. Rimsky-Korsakov]] (1987), and the Chief Researcher at the Russian Institute of Fine Arts History in St Petersburg. She is considered an Honoured Art Worker of Russian Federation.

==Education==
She graduated in 1965 from two departments at the Leningrad State Conservatoire named after N. Rimsky-Korsakov: the department of History of Music and Piano Performing Faculty, and the department of Organ Playing, having studied under Prof Isai Braudo. It was at the Conservatoire that she finished a postgraduate course in the department of History of Western Music, under the supervision of Prof Dr Mikhail Druskin. In 1970 Liudmila Kovnatskaya presented a candidate dissertation on Benjamin Britten’s oeuvre. In 1987 she completed a doctoral dissertation on English music of 20th century, at the Moscow research institute of Arts of Academy of Science, USSR.

==Professional experience==
Since 1987 Prof Kovnatskaya is a member of [[Union of Soviet Composers|Russian Composers’ Union]], and she was a member of the General Council for Cultural Affairs of St Petersburg from 1987 until 1993. In 2002 she became a member of the Council (Directorium) of the IMS. In the same year, she became a member of the editorial board of the journal “Tempo” (Cambridge).

In 2001 Prof Kovnatskaya became a materials consultant on Russian music for "The Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians" (London: McMillan, 2001). She was also a guest lecturer at the University of Manchester (1991), the Aldeburgh Festival (UK), and the Ural Conservatoire in Yekaterinburg.

Liudmila Kovnatskaya is the author of a monograph about [[Benjamin Britten]] (Moscow, 1974), in the book “English Music in the 20th Century: Sources and periods of development” (Moscow, 1986). Thanks to her research and organization activity in Russia, various festivals and concerts were organized, which were dedicated to English classic music, including Britten. Among them were “Ars Britannica” (1988–1990), the festival in honour of “The 80th anniversary of B. Britten” (1993), “The World of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]” (1996), the festival of Britten’s music on his 85th anniversary (1998), the jubilee concert in honour of Britten and [[Saint Cecilia]], patron saint of musicians (2003), the concert “World of Opera: Benjamin Britten”, and others.

Prof Kovnatskaya’s research fields include [[Music of Russia|History of Russian Music]]; she has written, edited and compiled books and articles on [[Dmitri Shostakovich|D. Shostakovich]]. Among her non-published manuscripts one can find a monumental work entitled “Ideological control of Musical avant-garde of 1920s: Leningrad Association of Contemporary Music in reports and other materials” (Soros Foundation Funding).

Shostakovich, Schoenberg, Britten, Purcell, Tippet, Arensky, Balakirev, English music, Russian-English connections, M. S. Druskin, A. Schweitzer and the Soviet musical epoch – all these subjects were established by Prof Kovnatskaya due to her intensive and rigorous nature as a researcher, editor and author of books, proceedings, collections and many-volume editions.

A separate field of her research and publishing activity is the ‘offering to the Teacher’, who was a famous musicologist and Professor of Leningrad Conservatoire Mikhail Druskin. In 2009, thanks to Prof Kovnatskaya, a two-volume collection was published, entitled “Memory to Mikhail Semenovich Druskin”, which united articles, recollections, biographical materials and correspondence. All who knew M. Druskin as a musician, musicologist and teacher took part in the creation of this 1000 page book. Furthermore, in addition to this, Liudmila Kovnatskaya led the task of re-publishing works by Druskin and, as a result, realized an extensive project: a 7-volume Collected Works. At present, the first volume, “Clavir music”, and the fourth volume, “Igor Stravinsky”, are published.

The '''National University of Northwestern Buenos Aires''' (''Universidad Nacional del Noroeste de la Provincia de Buenos Aires'' or UNNOBA hereafter) is a [[national university]] with head office and campus in [[Junín, Buenos Aires Province|Junín]], [[Argentina]]. This city concentrates 80% of the activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.diariodemocracia.com/diario/articulo.php?idNoticia=20139 |title = Guillermo Tamarit: "La centralidad del proyecto UNNOBA está en Junín y eso nadie lo discute" |author = [[Diario Democracia]] (Junín) |date = April 29, 2010 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100502034000/http://www.diariodemocracia.com/diario/articulo.php?idNoticia=20139 |archivedate = May 2, 2010 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and nearly 2 out of 3 students take classes there.&lt;ref name="inscriptos"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.diariodemocracia.com/diario/articulo.php?idNoticia=23549 |title = Aumenta la cantidad de inscriptos en Genética, Informática e Ingenieria y decrece en Abogacia |author = [[Diario Democracia]] (Junín) |date = December 29, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has also a campus in [[Pergamino, Buenos Aires Province|Pergamino]] city.

The UNNOBA was created on December 16, 2002, as the composition between the [[w:es:Centro Universitario Regional Junín|Junín Regional University Center]] (CURJ), started in 1990, which reached 15,000 students, and the [[w:es:Centro Regional Universitario de Pergamino|Pergamino Regional University Center]] (CRUP), established a year later, which had 2,600 students.

The University may establish more branches in other locations of the influence area which covers the northwest of the province of Buenos Aires, southern Santa Fe and Córdoba and northeast of La Pampa.

The university and the municipality of Junín, are the mainstays of the Buenos Aires Northwestern Technological Center (''Polo Tecnológico del Noroeste Bonaerense'') and the Regional Research Laboratory in Biofuels, both projects located in [[Junín, Buenos Aires Province|Junin]]. On the other hand, the Pergamino Biotechnology Center the School of Agricultural, Environmental and Natural Sciences (ECANA in Spanish) are being developed in [[Pergamino]]. It also has agreements with the [[National Agricultural Technology Institute]] (INTA) and the [[Maiztegui National Human Viral Disease Institute]] (INEVH) of [[Pergamino]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1854">The '''net reproduction rate''' ('''NRR''') is the average number of daughters that would be born to a female (or a group of females) if she passed through her lifetime conforming to the age-specific fertility and mortality rates of a given year. This rate is similar to the [[gross reproduction rate]] but takes into account that some females will die before completing their childbearing years. An NRR of '''one''' means that each generation of mothers is having exactly enough daughters to replace themselves in the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetwire.org/details/62] Retrieved on August 28, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224163842/http://www.planetwire.org/details/62 |date=February 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dharmalingham|first=A.|title=The Methods and Materials of Demography|editor=David Swanson |editor2=Jacob S.

The NRR is particularly relevant where sex ratios at birth are significantly affected by the use of reproductive technologies, or where life expectancy is low.

The current (2015–20) estimate for the NRR worldwide under the UN's medium variant model is 1.09 daughters per woman.&lt;ref&gt;http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=PopDiv&amp;f=variableID%3A48&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14594">The '''new town movement''' refers to towns that were built after [[World War II]] and that have been purposefully planned, developed and built as a remedy to overcrowding and congestion in some instances, and to scattered ad hoc settlements in others.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn &amp; Whittick, 1969, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for it was to decongest larger industrialized cities, rehousing people in freshly built, new and fully planned towns that were completely self-sufficient and provided for the community.

==Background and context: ‘The Urban Disease’==
In 1918, writing at a time when nineteenth century sanitary advances had revealed how badly off people in urban environments were and, owing to pioneers such as [[Patrick Geddes]], the relationship between social issues and town planning was slowly being realised, Frederick Osborn refers to urban problems collectively as the ‘urban disease’ &lt;ref name="Osborn"&gt;Osborn, F. 1942. ‘New Towns After the War’. Second Ed. J. M. Dent and Sons ltd, London. First Pub 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;
The urban disease, a by-product of the [[industrial revolution]], was brought on by a vicious cycle whereby industry chose to set up near population bases to ensure labour demands could be met which in turn attracted rural migrants seeking work to move into the city prompting further industry and so on. This resulted in greater pollution in the city, higher populations, and denser living conditions. Moreover, rural areas declining rapidly due to loss of population were left to decay.

Furthermore, there were no powers in place to stop prosperous families moving to open spaces or from industry growing in the centres. Fringe growth was vigorous and existing centres were left to deteriorate. Accordingly, those who moved to new fringe suburbs to escape the congestion were in fact “bolstering the very process that caused them to move away.” &lt;ref name="OsbornWhittick"&gt;Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‘New Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress’. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aspirations for Change ==
Although aspirations of dispersing great cities are as old as the industrial revolution itself, it was not until 1817 that the first model communities were proposed by social reformer [[Robert Owen]] to address overcrowded towns. Inspired by [[John Bellers]]’s 1695 proposal for a College of Industry, a colony for the poor enabling disadvantaged people to work and their children to be educated, Owen proposed small, self-contained communities of about twelve hundred people reliant on agriculture but with some other industry. However, his plans “foundered under the heavy weight of revolutionary ideas” &lt;ref&gt;Osborn, F. 1942. ‘New Towns After the War’. Second Ed. J. M. Dent and Sons ltd, London. First Pub 1918. Pp 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further model community ideas continued to arise but were each dismissed owing to the perception that they were unconvincing as business ventures.&lt;ref name="Osborn"/&gt; Enter [[Ebenezer Howard]], creator of the [[Garden City Movement]], who successfully founded [[Letchworth]] Garden City (1903) and proved that new towns could be economically viable. This was affirmed by [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], co-founder of the London School of Economics, who referred to his investments in the garden city movement as “entirely satisfactory, both economically and morally.” &lt;ref name="Osborn"/&gt;

== Garden Cities and New Towns ==

The New Town Movement was derived from the [[Garden City Movement]], founded by [[Ebenezer Howard]] in the late 1800s, as an alternative to the overcrowded, polluted, chaotic and miserable industrial cities that had appeared in Britain.  Towards the end of [[World War One]] a group developed – the ‘New Townsmen’ – whose members were Howard, F.J. Osborn, C.B. Purdom and W.G. Taylor. They began advocating the development of 100 new cities to be built by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Ward, 1998, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

== F.J. Osborn ==

If Howard is the ‘father’ of Garden Cities, then Frederick J. Osborn is certainly his ‘son’ – predecessor and champion of the New Towns. Osborn was born in 1885 and spent the majority of his life arguing the case for New Towns. Like Howard, he had quite a modest education, having never attended a university. But what he lacked in formal education, he made up for with ambition and wise career choices. In his early 30s, after meeting Howard through his job at the Howard Cottage Society, he took to the campaign for Garden Cities, though they were now referred to as New Towns.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Ward, 1998, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The initial campaigns for the establishment of New Towns failed. Although housing was built, it was often in the form of a ‘garden suburb’, or located on the edge of the existing cities – the antithesis of the Garden City idea.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Ward, 1998, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; With an increasing lack of faith in the government to take up the flag for public housing and new towns, Howard suggested to Osborn that he was wasting his time lobbying government, and that he would be ‘as old as [[Methuselah]]’ waiting for action.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 1996, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Beginnings of Reform==
In 1909 a greater understanding of the ‘urban disease’ saw Britain’s first town planning legislation created. Although technically opposed to [[wikt:fringe|fringe]] development, the [[Housing, Town Planning, &amp;c. Act 1909]] did not prevent it. Instead, in light of recent success with the development of [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]], the Act, realising that suburbs were easier to develop than towns, held the ethos that good suburbs were better than bad ones. Although planners of the day wanted new towns they were busy dealing with the demand for suburbs: “it is difficult for a technician to earn a living in an ivory tower” &lt;ref&gt;Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‘New Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress’. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963. pp 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, new towns required government direction which was beyond the scope of municipal powers alone.

Towards the end of the First World War the Garden City principles were reasserted by the ‘New Townsmen’ (Howard, Osborn, Purdon, and Tayler), who, referring to the success of Letchworth, proposed 100 government-supported new towns to address post-war rebuilding. However, the need for post-war housing resulted in new suburbs being prioritised over towns for the next two decades with some four million high standard houses built in between the wars albeit in the wrong places &lt;ref name="Osborn"/&gt; Conversely, some attempts were made at designing rebuilding efforts as satellite towns such as Manchester’s [[Wythenshawe]] and Liverpool’s [[Speke]] and Knowsley which also included provisions for industry. Nonetheless, these were still extensions of existing cities and not true New Towns.&lt;ref name="OsbornWhittick"/&gt; Furthermore, three-quarters of all the new housing was built privately meaning a default bottom-line approach was adopted into the inter-war development efforts.

During the inter-war years Government committees studied the problem of urban concentration with the Committee on Unhealthy Areas, chaired by [[Neville Chamberlain]] (1919-1921), recommending the restriction of further industry in London and the relocation of some of the city’s existing industry to garden cities. Although nothing came of these studies they became the origin of Chamberlain’s urban decentralisation interests which led to his setting up of the Barlow Commission once Prime Minister. Further important advances included a 1935 Departmental Committee recommendation for the building of new towns in line with garden city principles and a 1936 Special Areas Report reiterating the idea that no new industry should be allowed in London which gained public and political interest &lt;ref name="OsbornWhittick"/&gt;

== The Barlow Royal Commission ==
In 1938 Chamberlain, as the new Prime Minister, assigned a Royal Commission chaired by [[Sir Anderson Barlow]] into the urban concentration of population and industry. The resulting report raised the problem of large towns as a public issue for the first time and concluded that ‘planned decentralisation’ was favourable. However, owing to the outbreak of war in 1939 the Barlow Report, published in 1940, was initially ignored due to more immediate priorities although it eventually became a turning point for New Towns policy.&lt;ref&gt;Gibberd, F. 1980. ‘Harlow: the story of a new town’. Publications for Companies. Stevenage.&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage brought on by the [[Second World War]] provoked significant public interest in what post-war Britain would be like which was encouraged by the Government who facilitated talk about a ‘[[Better Britain]]’ to boost morale. Furthermore, the [[Ministry of Works and Building]] was commissioned to draft ideas. Ironically, the Barlow Report was quickly turned to as a best practice document.&lt;ref name="OsbornWhittick"/&gt;

In 1942, following the Report’s recommendation, the Government chose to create a central planning authority in the form of the [[Ministry of Works and Planning]]. More importantly the Government also announced that the Report’s decentralisation and relocation of population and industry initiatives would be followed.

==Plans and Legislation ==
Post-war rebuilding initiatives saw new plans drafted for London which for the first time addressed the issue of decentralisation. Firstly, the [[County of London Plan]] 1943 recognised that displacement of population and employment was necessary if the city was to be rebuilt at a desirable density. Moreover, the [[Greater London Plan]] of 1944 went further by suggesting that over one million people would need to be displaced into a mixture of satellite suburbs, existing rural towns, and new towns.&lt;ref name="OsbornWhittick"/&gt; 
	
In 1945 the New Towns Committee was formed to consider the “establishment, development, organisation, and administration” &lt;ref&gt;Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‘New Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress’. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963.pp 55&lt;/ref&gt; of new towns. Within eight months the committee had completed a highly comprehensive study into these issues resulting in positive recommendations for the construction of new towns. Accordingly, the [[New Towns Act 1946]] was passed which, coupled with the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947]], created a revolutionary “machinery for positive town construction”.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‘New Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress’. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963.pp56.&lt;/ref&gt; These innovative Acts resulted in a total of 28 New Towns being constructed in Britain over the following half-century &lt;ref&gt;Hall, P and Ward, C. 1998. ‘Sociable Cities: the Legacy of Ebenezer Howard’. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester pp. 41-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Towns in Britain ==
{{Main|New towns in the United Kingdom}}
It was in 1946 that the hard work of the ‘New Townsmen’ finally paid off with the passing of the [[New Towns Act 1946]]. Swayed by the need for post-war reconstruction, more housing, and a call to halt any further expansion of London’s girth, authorities saw that there was no alternative to the New Town solution.&lt;ref&gt;Hall &amp; Ward, 1998, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 27 [[New Towns]] were built after 1946. These were: [[Stevenage]], [[Crawley]], [[Hemel Hempstead]], [[Harlow]], [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]], [[Basildon]], [[Bracknell]] and [[Milton Keynes]] outside [[London]]; [[Newton Aycliffe]], [[Peterlee]] and [[Washington, Tyne and Wear|Washington]] in the [[North East England|North East]]; [[Skelmersdale]] and [[Runcorn]] in the [[North West England|North West]]; [[Corby]], [[Telford]] and [[Redditch]] in the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]]; [[Cwmbran]] and [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] in [[Wales]]; and in [[Scotland]], [[East Kilbride]], [[Glenrothes]], [[Cumbernauld]], [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]] and [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]]. Towns that were expanded under the new towns act were [[Peterborough]], [[Northampton]], [[Warrington]], [[Ipswich]] and [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]]-[[Leyland, Lancashire|Leyland]]-[[Chorley]].&lt;ref&gt;Osborn &amp; Whittick, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

== The New Towns Movement around the world ==

There were similar problems for New Towns advocates in other areas of the world. In Hong Kong, the [[new towns of Hong Kong|new towns]] were developed as an initiative from the British colonial government.  In other areas although they understood the concept and approved in large numbers, planners had trouble convincing their own governments or agencies of the merits of the proposal. In the United States, it was not until the 1960s that New Towns policies were put in place, although after World War Two grants had been extended for such things as [[slum clearance]], improved and increased housing, and road construction, and in the 1950s, to ‘comprehensive renewal projects’.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn &amp; Whittick, 1969, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In the former USSR, more than 800 New Towns were founded after the 1917 Revolution, but their growth was not constrained by specific limits.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn &amp; Whittick, 1969, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason it could be argued that these towns did not meet the criteria for New Towns since planned population and size limitations were an important part of the New Town idea. Other European countries such as France, Germany, Italy and Sweden also had some successes with new towns, especially as part of post-war reconstruction efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Osborn &amp; Whittick, 1969, p. 156-157&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable new towns in the United States include [[Reston, Virginia|Reston, VA]]; [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia, MD]]; [[Jonathan, Minnesota|Jonathan, MN;]] [[Peachtree City, Georgia|Peachtree City, GA]]; the "new town in town" of [[Riverside Plaza]] in Minneapolis.

}}'''Friedrich Otto Schott''' (17 December 1851 &amp;ndash; 27 August 1935) was a [[German people|German]] [[chemist]], glass technologist, and the inventor of [[borosilicate glass]]. He was the son of a window glass maker, Simon Schott. From 1870 to 1873 Schott studied chemical technology at the technical college in [[Aachen]] and at the universities of [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]] and [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]].  He attained a doctorate in glass chemistry at [[Friedrich Schiller University of Jena]] for his thesis “Contributions to the Theory and Practice of Glass Fabrication”.&lt;ref&gt;Schott, Otto. [http://www.schott.com/english/news/press.html?NID=1190 “Contributions to the Theory and Practice of Glass Fabrication”]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Schott developed a new [[lithium]]-based glass that possessed novel [[optics|optical]] properties.  Schott shared this discovery with [[Ernst Karl Abbe|Dr Ernst Abbe]], which was the catalyst for a long professional relationship between the two. 

In 1884, in association with Dr [[Ernst Abbe]] and [[Carl Zeiss]], Otto founded ''[[Glastechnische Laboratorium Schott &amp; Genossen]]'' (Schott &amp; Associates Glass Technology Laboratory) in Jena.  It was here, during the period 1887 through to 1893, that Schott developed borosilicate glass.  Borosilicate glass is distinguished for its high tolerance to heat and a substantial resistance to thermal shock (sudden temperature changes) and resistance to degradation when exposed to chemicals.

In 1926, Otto Schott retired from active work at Schott &amp; Gen.

Among other things it sent a sample on [[Ernst Abbe]].  These samples had a for the first time reached [[Homogen]]itaet, which it made possible to accomplish spectrometric measurements.  From this developed it up to [[1884]] glasses, which completely new optical characteristics exhibited.  At the same time it began at the tafelglasfabrik in Witten cover glasses for microscopic to manufacture [[Praeparat]]e.  It broke through thereby so far of [[England|Englishmen]] held [[monopoly]] on this area, by manufacturing these cover glasses of approximately 20% more favorably.

A specialized scientific exchange of letters with the physicist Abbe led it finally 1882 to Jena.  There it based together with Ernst Abbe as well as Roderich Zeiss|Roderich and Carl Zeiss in the year 1884 a glass-technical laboratory, the later Schott AG|Jenaer glass work Schott &amp; comrade.  First limited to the melt by optical glaesern and thermometer glass, the enterprise expanded its product range owing to the invention of the heatproof Borosilikatglases 1887 (Jenaer glass) rapidly.  Despite growth the enterprise became only in this year profitable.  The massive production of heatproof glasses for lighting purposes (gas glow light cylinders for gas and petroleum lamps) justified the economic success of the company.  Of this glaesern up to 1909 more than 30 million pieces were sold.

The improvements of optical glasses reached by it, among other things it succeeded to manufacture it glasses of also finely gradated optical constants, made the development possible of efficient microscopes and telescopes.  The moreover one developed it new glass sorts.  Due to its outstanding achievements he got 1905 by the technical university at that time Dresden was lent.  1909 had the successful work of 1,090 coworkers and 1919|later also he retired ten years its portions of the work to the Carl Zeiss donation.  He still worked until 1926 in the work as a "civil servant" of the glass work and member of the management.

'''PACE Institute of Management''' (PACE) was established in 2001 as a pioneer in [[business education]] in [[Vietnam]].  Headquartered in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], Vietnam, PACE delivers  public training programs, in-house training services, seminars, conferences, and publishing.

The institute has support from business community and intellectuals in the country to develop not-profit educational projects: Institute of Potential Leaders (IPL), Business Knowledge Portal (DoanhTri.vn), GoodBooks (SachHay.com), and OneBook.

During the past five years, the institute has invited several notable scholars and thinkers to speak in Vietnam to introduce new concepts and perspectives  related to Vietnam and the larger [[South East Asia]] region.  Speakers have included  [[Michael E. Porter]], the father of the modern strategy field; [[Paul Krugman]], the 2008 Nobel Laureate in Economics; and [[Philip Kotler]], the father of modern marketing.

PACE   has a [[publishing]] arm known as DT Books (previously PACE Books) that has acquired the rights to publish and translate many   books on education, business, and management.

To date, more than 70,000 entrepreneurs and directors from corporations, local, and foreign companies have attended PACE public training programs and utilized PACE in-house training services.

[[File:Pastiche.jpg|thumb|A pastiche combining elements of two paintings ([[:File:Antonio Pollaiuolo 005.jpg|original 1]] and [[:File:Sandro Botticelli 068.jpg|original 2]]), using [[Photoshop]]]]

A '''pastiche''' is a work of [[visual art]], literature, theatre, or music that [[Imitation|imitates]] the style or character of the work of one or more other artists.&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJVlZjIe5o8C&amp;pg=PA1005 |page=1005 |isbn=0-691-15491-0 |editor=Roland Greene |editor2=Stephen Cushman |editor3=Clare Cavanagh |editor4=Jahan Ramazani |editor5=Paul F. Rouzer |editor6=Harris Feinsod |editor7=David Marno |editor8=Alexandra Slessarev |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[parody]], pastiche celebrates, rather than mocks, the work it imitates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoestery |first=Ingeborg |title=Pastiche: Cultural Memory in Art, Film, Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AfpcjdU5fD8C |accessdate=2 August 2013 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=Bloomington |isbn=978-0-253-33880-8 |oclc=44812124 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''pastiche'' is a French [[cognate]] of the Italian noun ''[[wikt:pasticcio|pasticcio]]'', which is a [[pâté]] or pie-filling mixed from diverse ingredients.&lt;ref name="princeton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|pastiche|accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphorically, ''pastiche'' and ''[[pasticcio]]'' describe works that are either composed by several authors, or that incorporate stylistic elements of other artists' work. Pastiche is an example of [[eclecticism in art]].

[[Allusion]] is not pastiche. A literary allusion may refer to another work, but it does not reiterate it. Moreover, allusion requires the audience to share in the author's cultural knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A Glossary of Literary Terms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9VkYJuVn9YC&amp;pg=PA12 |isbn=1-4130-3390-3 |last1=Abrams |first1=Meyer Howard |last2=Harpham |first2=Geoffrey |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both allusion and pastiche are mechanisms of [[intertextuality]].

===Literature===
{{see also|Dionysian imitatio}}
In literature usage, the term denotes a [[literary technique]] employing a generally light-hearted tongue-in-cheek imitation of another's style; although jocular, it is usually respectful.{{citation needed | date = October 2013}}

For example, many stories featuring [[Sherlock Holmes]], originally penned by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], have been written as pastiches since the author's time.&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=8047|title= Pastiche Nuts|last= Lopresti|first= Rob|date= 2009-08-12|work= Tune It Or Die!|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=125|title= When Good Characters Go Bad|last= Lundin|first= Leigh|date= 2007-07-15|work= ADD Detective|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellery Queen]] and [[Nero Wolfe]] are other popular subjects of mystery parodies and pastiches.&lt;ref name="DA"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://criminalbrief.com/?p=3561|title= The Pastiche|last= Andrews|first= Dale|date= 2008-10-28|work= Mystery Masterclass|publisher= Criminal Brief|accessdate= 2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.themysteryplace.com/forum/messages.aspx?TopicID=241|title= Pastiche vs. fan fiction.

A similar example of pastiche is the posthumous continuations of the [[Robert E. Howard]] stories, written by other writers without Howard's authorization. This includes the [[Conan the Barbarian]] stories of [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]].
[[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]]'s novel ''[[The British Museum Is Falling Down]]'' ([[1965 in literature|1965]]) is a pastiche of works by [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], and [[Virginia Woolf]]. In 1991 [[Alexandra Ripley]] wrote the novel ''[[Scarlett (Ripley novel)|Scarlett]]'', a pastiche of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', in an unsuccessful attempt to have it recognized as a [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] sequel. 

In 2017, John Banville published Mrs. Osmond, a sequel to Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady, written in a style similar to that of James.

===Music===

[[Charles Rosen]] has characterized [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] various works in imitation of [[Baroque music|Baroque]] style as pastiche, and [[Edvard Grieg]]'s ''[[Holberg Suite]]'' was written as a conscious homage to the music of an earlier age. Some of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s works, such as his ''[[Variations on a Rococo Theme]]'' and [[Serenade for Strings (Tchaikovsky) | ''Serenade for Strings'']], employ a poised "classical" form reminiscent of 18th-century composers such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (the composer whose work was his favorite).&lt;ref name="brown_ng18628"&gt;* Brown, David, "Tchaikovsky, Pyotr Ilyich." In ''The New Grove Encyclopedia of Music and Musicians'' (London: MacMillan, 1980), 20 vols., ed. Sadie, Stanley. {{ISBN|0-333-23111-2}}. 18:628&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps one of the best examples of pastiche in modern music is that of [[George Rochberg]], who used the technique in his String Quartet No. 3 of 1972 and Music for the Magic Theater. Rochberg turned to pastiche from [[serialism]] after the death of his son in 1963.

"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] is unusual as it is a pastiche in both senses of the word, as there are many distinct styles imitated in the song, all "hodge-podged" together to create one piece of music.&lt;ref name="An Invitation to the Opera"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/oct95/queen.html|title= AN INVITATION TO THE OPERA|last= Baker|first= Roy Thomas|date= October 1995|publisher= Sound on Sound|accessdate= 2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar earlier example is "[[Happiness is a Warm Gun]]" by [[The Beatles]]. One can find musical "pastiches" throughout the work of the American composer [[Frank Zappa]].

A ''pastiche Mass'' is a musical [[Mass (music)|Mass]] where the constituent movements come from different Mass settings. Most often this convention has been chosen for concert performances, particularly by [[early music | early-music]] ensembles. Masses are composed of movements: [[Kyrie]], [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]], [[Credo]], [[Sanctus]], [[Agnus Dei (music)|Agnus Dei]]; for example, the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' by [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and the ''[[Messe de Nostre Dame]]'' by [[Guillaume de Machaut]]. In a pastiche Mass, the performers may choose a Kyrie from one composer, and a Gloria from another; or choose a Kyrie from one setting of an individual composer, and a Gloria from another.

===Musical theatre===

In musical theatre pastiche is often an indispensable tool for evoking the sounds of a particular era for which a show is set. For the 1971 musical ''[[Follies]]'', a show about a reunion of performers from a musical [[revue]] set between the World Wars, [[Stephen Sondheim]] wrote over a dozen songs in the style of Broadway songwriters of the 1920s and 1930s. Sondheim imitates not only the music of composers such as [[Cole Porter]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[Jerome Kern]], and [[George Gershwin]] but also the lyrics of writers such as [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Dorothy Fields]], [[Otto Harbach]], and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. For example, Sondheim notes that the torch song "[[Losing My Mind]]" sung in the show contains "near-stenciled rhythms and harmonies" from the Gershwins' [[The Man I Love (song)|"The Man I Love"]] and lyrics written in the style of Dorothy Fields.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sondheim, "Follies" Finishing the Hat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of musical pastiche also appear in other Sondheim shows including [[Gypsy (musical) | ''Gypsy'']], [[Saturday Night (musical) | ''Saturday Night'']], and ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sondheim, "Follies", Finishing the Hat (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), p.200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===

Pastiche can also be a [[Cinematic techniques|cinematic]] device whereby filmmakers pay [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to another filmmaker's style and use of [[cinematography]], including camera angles, [[lighting]], and [[mise en scène]]. A film's writer may also offer a pastiche based on the works of other writers (this is especially evident in historical films and [[documentaries]] but can be found in [[non-fiction]] [[drama]], [[comedy]] and [[Horror film|horror]] films as well). Italian director [[Sergio Leone]]`s [[Once Upon a Time in the West]] is a pastiche of earlier American [[Westerns]]. Another major filmmaker, [[Quentin Tarantino]], often uses various plots, characteristics and themes from many lesser-known films to create his films, among them from the films of Sergio Leone, in effect creating a pastiche of a pastiche. Tarantino has openly stated that "I steal from every single movie ever made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/markets-festivals/quentin-tarantino-the-great-recycler-1200703098/|title=Quentin Tarantino: The Great Recycler|first=Peter|last=Debruge|date=7 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Todd Haynes]]' 2002 film [[Far From Heaven]] was a conscious attempt to replicate a typical [[Douglas Sirk]] melodrama - in particular [[All That Heaven Allows]]. The film works as a mostly reverential and unironic tribute to Sirk's filmmaking, lovingly re-creating the stylized mise-en-scene, colors, costumes, cinematography and lighting of Sirkian melodrama.

In cinema, the influence of [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars]]'' films (spawning their own pastiches, such as the 1983 3D film ''[[Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn]]'') can be regarded as a function of [[postmodernity]].&lt;ref name="Jameson, 1991"&gt;(Jameson, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Sandoval, Chela. Methodology of the Oppressed. Minneapolis,MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
In discussions of [[urban planning]], the term "pastiche" may describe developments as imitations of the building styles created by major [[architects]]: with the implication that the derivative work is unoriginal and of little merit, and the term is generally attributed without reference to its urban context. Many post-war European developments can in this way be described as pastiches of the work of architects and planners such as [[Le Corbusier]] or [[Ebenezer Howard]]. The term itself is not pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;Jamses Stevens Curl, "Oxford Dictionary of Architecture", 2006, p562.&lt;/ref&gt; however [[Alain de Botton]] describes pastiche as "an unconvincing reproduction of the styles of the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work= [[Channel 4]]|url= http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-perfect-home/episode-guide|title= Alain de Botton: The Perfect Home}}

'''Plant collecting''' is the acquisition of plant specimens for the purposes of research, cultivation, or as a hobby. Plant specimens may be kept alive, but are more commonly dried and pressed to preserve the quality of the specimen. Plant collecting is an ancient practice with records of a Chinese botanist collecting roses over 5000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Plant Hunters|last=Whittle|first=T|publisher=Heinemann|year=1970|isbn=|location=London|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbaria]] are collections of preserved plants samples and their associated data for scientific purposes. The largest herbarium in the world exist at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle]], in Paris, France. Plant samples in herbaria typically include a reference sheet with information about the plant and details of collection. This detailed and organized system of filing provides horticulturist and other researchers alike with a way to find information about a certain plant, and a way to add new information to an existing plant sample file.

The collection of live plant specimens from the wild, sometimes referred to as '''plant hunting''',  is an activity that has occurred for centuries. The earliest recorded evidence of plant hunting was in 1495 BC when botanists were sent to [[Somalia]] to collect incense trees for [[Queen Hatshepsut]]. The [[Victorian era]] saw a surge in plant hunting activity as botanical adventurers explored the world to find exotic plants to bring home, often at considerable personal risk. These plants usually ended up in [[botanical garden]]s or the private gardens of wealthy collectors. Prolific plant hunters in this period included [[William Lobb]] and his brother [[Thomas Lobb]], [[George Forrest (botanist)|George Forrest]], [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]], [[Charles Maries]] and [[Robert Fortune]].

== Plant pressing ==
Proper pressing and mounting techniques are critical to the longevity of a collected plant sample. Properly preserved plant samples can last for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/explore/curriculum-collections/biodiversity-counts/plant-identification/collecting-plants|title=Collecting Plants|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New York Botanical Garden]] itself holds plant samples that date back to the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804–1806.

=== Sample gathering ===
The first step of plant pressing begins with the collection of the sample. When collecting a sample it is important to first make sure that land you are collecting on allows for the removal of natural specimens. The next step after finding a suitable plant for collection is to assign it with a number for record keeping purposes. This number system is up to the individual collector, but usually involves the date of collection or the sequential number of that collection. Along with an assigned number, observations about the plant's location and live appearance should be noted in detail. These field notes will accompany the finished sample to provide supplementary information about the plant.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/11-12.pdf|title=Preparing And Storing Herbarium Specimens|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://store.msuextension.org/publications/AgandNaturalResources/MT198359AG.pdf|title=How to Collect, Press and Mount Plants|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Compression ====
After cleaning the sample of any mud or dirt, the next step is to press the sample. Some samples may press better if they have been left to wilt for a few days. However plants should never be allowed to spoil or decompose before pressing, as this will impact the quality of the dried product. Plant presses are most commonly constructed with two flat smooth pieces of wood, and some type of compression mechanism. Compression may be accomplished with tightened nuts and bolts on the corners of the press, with tightened straps around the press, or by placing weights on top of the press. When placing in the press, plant samples should be sandwiched between a few layers of absorbent [[Blotting paper|blotter]]. Newspaper and cardboard are two common choices for blotter material. When arranging the plant in the press it is important to remember that the dried plant product will be fragile and inflexible, so position the plant exactly as you wish the final product to appear. Tighten the press and wait approximately a day to check up on the plant. The blotter should be taken out and replaced with dry blotter roughly every 24 hours. Complete drying time will vary depending on the type of plant, but is generally 7–10 days. Fleshier plants such as succulents will take longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/explore/curriculum-collections/biodiversity-counts/plant-identification/how-to-press-and-preserve-plants/|title=How to Press and Preserve Plants|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Mounting ====
After the plant sample has been sufficiently dried and pressed, it must be mounted. The quality of mounting not only impacts the appearance of the plant sample, but also determines the rate of deterioration the sample will experience. Herbarium quality mounts use specialized paper for the best protection against deterioration.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sdnhm.org/science/botany/resources/general-information/how-to-make-a-plant-collection/|title=Making a Plant Collection|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper can either be 100% alpha cellulose paper or cotton “rag” paper. These types of paper are ideal for preserving plant samples because they are acid free and pH neutral. Samples can be strapped to the paper with linen tape, or glued onto the sheet. If glue is needed, it is recommended that Grade A [[methyl cellulose]] mixed with water be used for optimal deterioration resistance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Storage ====
In order for plant specimens to be kept in good condition for future reference, adequate storage conditions are needed. The storage space should be kept in a low light, low [[humidity]] environment. The temperature of the storage space should be kept cool, between 50 – 65 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brit.org/herbarium/plantcollecting/storage|title=BRIT Herbarium|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to keep the storage space free of harmful pest. It is recommended to protect the specimens by sheathing the sheets in sealed plastic bags. Various [[pesticide]]s may also be used to protect the storage space from pest infestation. If pest infestation has already occurred, the samples should be frozen for three to four days. Freezing new additions of plant samples is a suggested preventative measure against the introduction of pest to the storage space.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Collection of herbarium specimens ==
[[Herbarium]] specimens of plants are collected for a number of different uses. They can assist in  accurate identification and provide a species record for a time and place that can be used in distribution maps. They can also provide biological material for researchers, a reference point to document scientific names and vouchers for research and seed collections.&lt;ref name=qh&gt;{{cite paper|editor=Bean, A.R.|title=Collecting and preserving plant specimens, A Manual|url=http://www.qld.gov.au/environment/assets/documents/plants-animals/herbarium/collecting-manual.pdf|publisher=
Queensland Herbarium, Environmental Protection Agency Biodiversity Sciences unit, Brisbane
|date=2006|isbn=1-920928-06-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA barcoding, a new method of identification of plant vouchers, is being used in herbaria across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://botany.si.edu/projects/dnabarcode/index.htm|title=Plant DNA Barcode Project|website=botany.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]] creates their barcodes from a short sequence of plant DNA, which can be easily identified from all healthy specimens of the species. This barcode is then printed and placed onto the plant mount. By creating these DNA barcodes, the process of organizing and loaning plant specimens becomes more streamlined and can be mechanized.

===Voucher specimens===
 
Voucher specimens are select herbarium specimens. What distinguishes these specimens from others is that a voucher specimen is a "representative sample of an expertly identified organism." These specimens are usually associated with a professional research article and are considered to be more official references than a typical herbarium specimen. Voucher specimens can be useful in many ways such as use for comparison when scientists think they have found a new species or when dichotomous keys have narrowed the possible species down to a few that have minute differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why vouchers matter in botanical research1|first=Theresa M.|last=Culley|date=29 October 2013|publisher=|journal=Applications in Plant Sciences|volume=1|issue=11|doi=10.3732/apps.1300076|pmid=25202501|pmc=4103463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plant collecting as a hobby ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}

Plant collecting may also refer to a hobby, in which the hobbyist takes identifiable samples of [[plant]] species found in nature, dries them, and stores them in a paper sheet album, a simple [[herbarium]], along with the information of the finding location, finding date, etc. necessary scientific information. As in many [[collecting]] hobbies, rarer specimens have been valued. However, when collecting living organisms, the [[Conservation ethic|conservation aspects]] must precede the collector's ambitions. This has led in some cases to a collector voluntarily taking part, helping scientists, in some research areas, provided he can store the "[[collectible]]". In fact, historically, many [[species]] have initially been found within a collection of a collector.

Usually, a plant can be identified in nature, since they are stationary.
The advent of [[digital camera]]s has led many plant collectors to switch totally to [[photography]]. Some have switched to collecting live specimens of various plant species in their gardens, building a sort of "private [[botanical garden]]". Some have specialized in a specific group, the [[orchid]]s and the [[rose]]s and their [[cultivar]]s are among the most collected.
&lt;ref name="brit.org"&gt;http://www.brit.org/sites/default/files/public/Herbarium/Plant_Collection_and_Preservation_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poaching ==
{{expand section|date=March 2016}}
Illegal collection of plants is known as plant poaching. A report on the risk of rare plant [[poaching]] has provided data showing possible connections between geography and the rate of poaching in the [[Shenandoah National Park]], Virginia, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=John A.|last2=Manen|first2=Frank T. van|last3=Thatcher|first3=Cindy A.|date=2011-09-01|title=Geographic Profiling to Assess the Risk of Rare Plant Poaching in Natural Areas|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-011-9687-3|journal=Environmental Management|language=en|volume=48|issue=3|pages=577–587|doi=10.1007/s00267-011-9687-3|issn=0364-152X|bibcode=2011EnMan..48..577Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The openings for poaching were found to be increased in locations with easy accessibility, such as roads, trails, and developed areas. The condition of the environment can determine the levels of poaching, with regions of higher quality receiving more attention from poachers.

=== Ethics ===

The hobby and practice of plant collecting is known to have been the cause of declines in certain plant populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norton|first=David A.|last2=Lord|first2=Janice M.|last3=Given|first3=David R.|last4=Lange|first4=Peter J. De|date=1994-01-01|title=Over-Collecting: An Overlooked Factor in the Decline of Plant Taxa|jstor=1222876|journal=Taxon|volume=43|issue=2|pages=181–185|doi=10.2307/1222876}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be the result of hobbyists being oblivious to the status of a particular species, collectors of valuable species for profit, or researchers over collecting to fill slots in herbaria. This issue can be solved with proper research on the status of species before a plant is collected and taking the smallest sample possible.

== Safety and precautions ==
While plant collecting may seem like a very safe and harmless practice, there is a few things collectors should keep in mind to protect themselves. First collectors should always be aware of the land where they are collecting. As in [[hiking]] there will be certain limitations to whether or not public access is granted on a plot of land and if collection from that land is allowed. For example, in a [[National park]] of the [[United States]], plant collection is not allowed unless given special permission. Collecting internationally will involve some logistics, such as official permits which will most likely be required to bring plants both from the country of collection and to the destination country. The major herbaria can be useful to the average hobbyist in aiding them in acquiring these permits.&lt;ref name="brit.org"/&gt;

If traveling to a remote location to access samples, it is safe practice to inform someone of your whereabouts and planned time of return. If traveling in hot weather, collectors should bring adequate water to avoid dehydration. Forms of sun protection such as sunscreen and wide brimmed hats may be essential depending on location. Travel to remote locations will most likely involve walking measurable distances in wild terrain, so precautions synonymous with those related to [[hiking]] should be taken.&lt;ref name="brit.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/assets/documents/plants-animals/herbarium/collecting-manual.pdf|title=Collecting and preserving plant specimens, a manual|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
Plant "discovery" means the first time that a new plant was recorded for science, often in the form of dried and pressed plants (a [[herbarium]] specimen) being sent to a botanical establishment such as [[Kew Gardens]] in London, where it would be examined, classified and named.&lt;ref name="Musgrave"&gt;{{cite book | author= Toby Musgrave | author2= Chris Gardner | author3= Will Musgrave | last-author-amp= yes | title=The Plant Hunters| publisher=[[Orion Publishing Group|Seven Dials]] | date=1999|pages= 10–11| isbn=1-84188-001-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant "introduction" means the first time that living matter – seed, cuttings or a whole plant – was brought back to Europe. Thus, the [[Handkerchief tree]] (''[[Davidia involucrata]]'') was discovered by [[Père David]] in 1869 but introduced to Britain by [[Ernest Henry Wilson|Ernest Wilson]] in 1901.&lt;ref name="Musgrave" /&gt;

[[File:Flamingo Flower Orchid.JPG|thumb|Flamingo Flower]]

Often, the two happened simultaneously: thus Sir [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] discovered and introduced his Himalayan [[rhododendron]]s between 1849 and 1851.&lt;ref name="Musgrave" /&gt;

[[File:Leaf Tissue Structure.svg|500px|thumb|right|Anatomy of a [[Eudicots|eudicot]] leaf]]

A '''plant cuticle''' is a protecting film covering the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] of [[leaf|leaves]], young shoots and other aerial [[plant organ]]s without [[periderm]].  It consists of lipid and hydrocarbon polymers impregnated with wax, and is synthesized exclusively by the epidermal cells.&lt;ref name="Kolattukudy 1996"&gt;Kolattukudy, PE (1996) Biosynthetic pathways of cutin and waxes, and their sensitivity to environmental stresses. In: Plant Cuticles. Ed. by G. Kerstiens,  BIOS Scientific publishers Ltd., Oxford, pp 83-108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The plant cuticle is a layer of lipid polymer impregnated with waxes that is present on the outer surfaces of the primary organs of all vascular land plants. 
It is also present in the [[sporophyte]] generation of [[hornwort]]s, and in both sporophyte and [[gametophyte]] generations of [[moss]]es &lt;ref name=Budke&gt;Budke, J.M., Goffinet, B. and Jones, C.S. (2013). Dehydration protection provided by a maternal cuticle improves offspring fitness in the moss ''Funaria hygrometrica''. Annals of Botany doi:10.1093/aob/mct033&lt;/ref&gt;  The plant cuticle forms a coherent outer covering of the plant that can be isolated intact by treatment of plant tissue with enzymes such as pectinase and cellulase.

==Composition==
The cuticle is composed of an insoluble cuticular membrane impregnated by and covered with soluble [[wax]]es. [[Cutin]], a [[polyester]] [[polymer]] composed of inter-esterified [[omega hydroxy acid]]s which are cross-linked by [[ester]] and [[epoxide]] bonds, is the best-known structural component of the cuticular membrane.&lt;ref name="Holloway 1982"&gt;Holloway, PJ (1982) The chemical constitution of plant cutins. In: Cutler, DF, Alvin, KL and Price, CE The Plant Cuticle. Academic Press, pp. 45-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stark&gt;Stark, RE and Tian, S (2006) The cutin biopolymer matrix. In:
Riederer, M &amp; Müller, C (2006) Biology of the Plant Cuticle. Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; The cuticle can also contain a non-saponifiable [[hydrocarbon]] polymer known as [[Cutan (polymer)|Cutan]].&lt;ref "Tegelaar 1989"&gt;Tegelaar, EW, et al. (1989) Scope and limitations of several pyrolysis methods in the structural elucidation of a macromolecular plant constituent in the leaf cuticle of ''Agave americana'' L., Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis, 15, 29-54&lt;/ref&gt; The cuticular membrane is impregnated with cuticular waxes&lt;ref name="Jetteretal 2006"&gt;Jetter, R, Kunst, L &amp; Samuels, AL (2006) Composition of plant cuticular waxes. In: Riederer, M &amp; Müller, C (2006) Biology of the Plant Cuticle. Blackwell Publishing, 145-181&lt;/ref&gt; and covered with [[epicuticular wax]]es, which are mixtures of [[hydrophobic]] [[aliphatic compound]]s, hydrocarbons with chain lengths typically in the range C16 to C36.&lt;ref name="Baker 1982"&gt;Baker, EA (1982) Chemistry and morphology of plant epicuticular waxes. In: Cutler, DF, Alvin, KL and Price, CE The Plant Cuticle. Academic Press, 139-165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The primary function of the plant cuticle is as a water permeability barrier that prevents evaporation of water from the epidermal surface, and also prevents external water and solutes from entering the tissues.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In addition to its function as a permeability barrier for water and other molecules (prevent water loss), the micro and nano-structure of the cuticle confer specialised surface properties that prevent contamination of plant tissues with external water, dirt and microorganisms. Aerial organs of many plants, such as the leaves of the sacred lotus (''[[Nelumbo|Nelumbo nucifera]]'') have ultra-hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties that have been described by Barthlott and Neinhuis (1997).&lt;ref name="Barthlott"&gt;Barthlott, W &amp; Neinhuis, C (1997) Purity of the sacred lotus, or escape from contamination in biological surfaces. Planta 202, 1-8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lotus effect]] has applications in [[biomimetic]] technical materials. 

Dehydration protection provided by a maternal cuticle improves offspring fitness in the moss ''Funaria hygrometrica''&lt;ref name=Budke/&gt; and in the sporophytes of all [[vascular plant]]s. In [[angiosperm]]s the cuticle tends to be thicker on the top of the leaf ([[glossary of botanical terms#adaxial|adaxial surface]]), but is not always thicker. The leaves of [[xerophyte|xerophytic]] plants adapted to drier climates have more equal cuticle thicknesses compared to those of [[mesophyte|mesophytic]] plants from wetter climates that do not have a high risk of dehydration from the under sides of their leaves.

"The waxy sheet of cuticle also functions in defense, forming a physical barrier that resists penetration by virus particles, bacterial cells, and the spores and growing filaments of fungi". &lt;ref name="Freeman 2002"&gt;Freeman, S (2002) Biological Science. Prentice-Hall, Inc., New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
The plant cuticle is one of a series of [[Apomorphy|innovations]], together with [[stoma]]ta, [[xylem]] and [[phloem]] and intercellular spaces in [[Plant stem|stem]] and later [[leaf]] mesophyll tissue, that [[embryophyte|plants]] evolved more than 450 million years ago during the transition between life in water and life on land.&lt;ref name="Raven 1977"&gt;Raven, J.A. (1977) The evolution of vascular land plants in relation to supracellular transport processes. Advances in Botanical Research, 5, 153-219&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these features enabled upright plant shoots exploring aerial environments to conserve water by internalising the gas exchange surfaces, enclosing them in a waterproof membrane and providing a variable-aperture control mechanism, the [[stoma]]tal guard cells, which regulate the rates of [[transpiration]] and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exchange.

'''Reconciliation ecology''' is the branch of [[ecology]] which studies ways to encourage [[biodiversity]] in [[Human ecosystem|human-dominated]] [[ecosystem]]s. [[Michael Rosenzweig]] first articulated the concept in his book ''[[Win-Win Ecology]]'',&lt;ref name=winwin&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Michael|title=Win-win Ecology, How the Earth's species can survive in the midst of human enterprise.|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the theory that there is not enough area for all of earth’s biodiversity to be saved within designated [[nature preserve]]s. Therefore, humans should increase biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes. By managing for biodiversity in ways that do not decrease human utility of the system, it is a "[[win-win]]" situation for both human use and native biodiversity. The science is based in the ecological foundation of human land-use trends and species-area relationships. It has many benefits beyond protection of biodiversity, and there are numerous examples of it around the globe. Aspects of reconciliation ecology can already be found in management legislation, but there are challenges in both public acceptance and ecological success of reconciliation attempts.

==Theoretical basis==

===Human land use trends===
{{Main|List of environmental issues}}
Traditional conservation is based on "reservation and restoration"; reservation meaning setting pristine lands aside for the sole purpose of maintaining biodiversity, and restoration meaning returning human impacted ecosystems to their natural state. However, reconciliation ecologists argue that there is too great a proportion of land already impacted by humans for these techniques to succeed.

While it is difficult to measure exactly how much land has been transformed by human use, estimates range from 39 to 50%.  This includes [[agricultural]] land, [[pasture]]land, [[urban area|urban]] areas, and heavily harvested [[forest]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vitousek|first=P. M. |author2=H. A.

Humans have also changed species compositions of many landscapes that they do not dominate directly by introducing new species or harvesting native species. This new assemblage of species has been compared to previous mass extinctions and [[speciation]] events caused by formation of [[land bridge]]s and colliding of continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mooney|first=H.

Cleland |title=The evolutionary impact of invasive species|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2001|volume=98|pages=5446–5451|doi=10.1073/pnas.091093398|pmid=11344292|issue=10|pmc=33232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Species-area relationships===
[[File:SAR(Species-area curve).gif|250px|thumb|The species-area relationship for a contiguous habitat]]
The need for reconciliation ecology was derived from patterns of species distribution and diversity. The most relevant of these patterns is the [[species-area curve]] which states that a larger geographic area will contain higher species diversity. This relationship has been supported by so large a body of research that some scholars consider it to be an ecological law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lomolino|first=M. V.|title=Ecology's most general, yet protean pattern: the species-area relationship|journal=Journal of Biogeography|year=2000|volume=27|pages=17–26|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.2000.00377.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main reasons for the relationship between number of species and area, both of which can be used as an argument for conservation of larger areas. The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis claims that a larger geographic area will have a greater variety of habitat types, and therefore more species adapted to each unique habitat type. Setting aside a small area will not encompass enough habitat variety to contain a large variety of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenzweig|first=Michael|title=Reconciliation ecology and the future of species diversity|journal=Oryx|year=2003|volume=37|pages=194–206|doi=10.1017/s0030605303000371}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equilibrium hypothesis draws from the theory of [[island biogeography]] as described by [[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson|Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacArthur, R. H. and E. O. Wilson|title=The Theory of Island Biogeography|year=1967|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large areas have large populations, which are less likely to go extinct through stochastic processes. The theory assumes that speciation rates are constant with area, and a lower extinction rate coupled with higher speciation leads to more species.

The species-area relationship has often been applied to conservation, often quantitatively. The simplest and most commonly used formula was first published by [[Frank W. Preston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Preston|first=F. W.|title=Time and Space and the Variation of Species|journal=Ecology|year=1960|volume=41|pages=612–627|doi=10.2307/1931793}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of species present in a given area increases in relationship to that area with the relationship S = cA&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt;  where S is the number of species, A is the area, and c and z are constants which vary with the system under study. This equation has frequently been used for designing reserve size and placement (see [[SLOSS debate]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Desmet|first=P|author2=R. Cowling |title=Using the species-area relationship to set baseline targets for conservation|journal=Ecology and Society|year=2004|volume=9|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common version of the equation used in reserve design is the formula for inter-island diversity, which has a z-value between 0.25-0.55,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenzweig|first=Michael|title=Species diversity in space and time|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|location=Cambridge, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning protecting 5% of the available habitat will preserve 40% of the species present. However, inter-provincial species area relationships have z-values closer to 1, meaning protecting 5% of habitat will only protect 5% of species diversity.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt;

Taken together, proponents of reconciliation ecology see the species-area relationship and human domination of a large percentage of the earth's area as a sign that we will not be able to set aside enough land to protect all of life's biodiversity. There can be negative effects of setting land aside because it means the remaining land is used more intensely.&lt;ref name=Green /&gt; For example, less land is required for crop production when high levels of inorganic [[fertilizer]] is applied, but these chemicals will affect nearby land set aside for natural ecosystems. The direct benefits of land transformation for the growing world population often make it ethically difficult to justify the tradeoff between biodiversity and human use.&lt;ref name=Daily&gt;{{cite book|last=Daily|first=Gretchen|title=Countryside biogeography and the provision of ecosystem services.in Forum on Biodivesity.|year=1997|publisher=National Academy Press|location=National Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reconciled ecosystems are ones in which humans dominate, but natural biodiversity is encouraged to persist within the human landscape. Ideally, this creates a more sustainable [[socio-ecological system]] and does not necessitate a trade off between biodiversity and human use.

===Beyond natural history===
[[File:Lanius excubitor 1 (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|250px|thumb|The life history of the [[great grey shrike]] is better understood as a result of focused natural history and reconciliation ecology.]]
How can understanding of species' natural history aid their effective conservation in human-dominated ecosystems?  Humans often conduct activities that allow for the incorporation of other species, whether as a by-product or as a result of a focus on nature.&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005" /&gt;  Traditional [[natural history]] can only inform how best to do this to a certain degree, because landscapes have been changed so dramatically.  However, there is much more to learn through direct study of species' ecology in human-dominated [[ecosystems]], through what is known as focused natural history.  Rosenzweig &lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005" /&gt; cites four examples: [[shrikes]] (Laniidae) thrived in altered landscapes when wooden fence post perches allowed them easy access to pouncing on prey, but inhospitable [[steel fence post]]s contributed to their decline.  Replacing steel fence posts with wood fence posts reverses the shrikes' decline and allows humans to determine the reasons for the distribution and abundance of shrikes.  Additionally, the [[cirl bunting]] (''Emberiza cirlus'') thrived on farms when fields alternated between harvests and hay, but declined where farmers began to plant winter grain crops, [[natterjack toads]] (''Bufo calamatus'') declined when reductions in [[sheep]] grazing ceased to alter ponds to their preferred shape and depth, and [[longleaf pine]] (''Pinus palustris'') declined in the Southeastern United States when lack of [[wildfires]] prevented its return after [[timbering]].&lt;ref name="Rosenzweig 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenzweig | first1 = M.L. | year = 2005 | title = Avoiding mass extinction: basic and applied challenges | url = | journal = The American Midland Naturalist | volume = 153 | issue = | pages = 195–208 | doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2005)153[0195:amebaa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noss 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noss | first1 = R.F. | last2 = Beier | first2 = P. | last3 = Covington | first3 = W.W. | last4 = Grumbine | first4 = R.E. | last5 = Lindenmayer | first5 = D.B. | last6 = Prather | first6 = J.W. | last7 = Schmiegelow | first7 = F. | last8 = Sisk | first8 = T.D. | last9 = Vosick | first9 = D.J. | year = 2006 | title = Recommendations for integrating restoration ecology and conservation biology in ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern united states | url = | journal = Restoration Ecology | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 4–10 | doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2006.00099.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, applying focused natural history in human-dominated landscapes can contribute to conservation efforts.

The emerging concept of [[ecosystem services]] (coined by the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] in 2005) changed the way ecologists perceived so-called "ordinary species" : as abundant species represent the bulk of biomass and biological processes, even if they don't appear directly threatened their conservation constitutes as a major concern for maintaining these services on which rely both human societies and rarer species.&lt;ref name="Couvet"/&gt; Reconciliation ecology then proposes to take care of such species and to maintain (or restore) ecological processes in human-dominated ecosystems, hence creating ecological corridors and preserving a good functioning of biological cycles.&lt;ref name="Couvet"/&gt;

==Benefits==
Reconciliation ecologists believe increasing biodiversity within human dominated landscapes will help to save global biodiversity. This is sometimes preferable to traditional conservation because it does not impair human use of the landscape and therefore may be more acceptable to stakeholders.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; However, not only will it encourage biodiversity in the areas where it takes place, but many scholars cite other benefits of including biodiversity in human landscapes on both global conservation activities and human well-being.

===Habitat connectivity benefits===
Increasing wildlife habitat in human-dominated systems not only increases ''in situ'' biodiversity, it also aids in conservation of surrounding protected areas by increasing connectivity between habitat patches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anand|first=M. O|author2=J. Krishnaswamy |author3=A. Kumar |author4=A.

S|author2=R. F. Simons |author3=B. D. Losito |author4=E. Fiorito |author5=M. A. Miles |author6=M.

===Educational benefits===
Placing importance on native ecosystems and biodiversity within human landscapes increases human exposure to natural areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=J. R|title=Biodiversity conservation and the extinction of experience|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|year=2005|volume=20|pages=430–434|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.05.013|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been shown to increase appreciation of nature. Studies have shown that students who participate in [[outdoor education]] programs show a greater understanding of their environment, greater willingness to act in order to save the environment, and even a greater enthusiasm for school and learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogner|first=F. X|title=The influence of short-term outdoor ecology education on long-term variables of environmental perspective|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|year=1998|volume=29|pages=17–29|doi=10.1080/00958969809599124|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dillon|first=J. |author2=M.

Benefield|title=The value of outdoor learning: evidence from research in the UK and elsewhere|journal=School Science Review|year=2006|volume=87|pages=107–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green spaces have also been shown connect urban dwellers of all ages with nature, even when dominated by [[invasive species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teillac-Deschamps|first=P |author2=R.

===Psychological benefits===
The results of reconciliation ecology can also improve human well-being. [[E. O. Wilson]] has hypothesized that humans have an innate desire to be close to nature (see [[biophilia hypothesis|Biophilia]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=E O|title=Biophilia|year=1984|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous studies have linked natural settings to decreased stress and faster recovery during hospital stays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ulrich|first=R. S.|author2=R. F. Simons |author3=B. D. Losito |author4=E. Fiorito |author5=M. A. Miles |author6=M. Zelson |title=Stress recovery during exposures to natural and urban environments|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|year=1991|volume=11|pages=201–230|doi=10.1016/S0272-4944(05)80184-7|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Many examples of native plants and animals taking advantage of human dominated landscapes have been unintentional, but may be enhanced as part of reconciliation ecology. Others are intentional redesigns of human landscapes to better accommodate native biodiversity. These have been going on for many hundreds of years including examples within agricultural systems, urban and suburban systems, marine systems, and even industrial areas.

===Historical examples===
While Rosenzweig formalized the concept, humans have been encouraging biodiversity within human landscapes for millennia. In the Trebon Biosphere Reserve of the [[Czech Republic]], a system of human-engineered [[aquaculture]] ponds built in the 1500s not only provides a profitable harvest of fish, but also provides habitat for a hugely diverse wetland ecosystem. Many cities in Europe take pride in their local population of [[storks]], which nest on roofs or in church towers that replace the trees they would naturally nest in.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; There are records of humans maintaining plants in pleasure gardens as early as ancient [[Mesopotamia]], with an especially strong tradition of incorporating gardens into the architecture of human landscapes in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=X.|author2=J. Wu |title=Sustainable landscape architecture: implications of the Chinese philosophy of "unity of man with nature" and beyond|journal=Landscape Ecology|year=2009|volume=24|pages=1015–1026|doi=10.1007/s10980-009-9350-z|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural systems===
[[File:Faidherbia albida.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Agroforestry]] in [[Burkina Faso]] allows [[sorghum]] crop to be grown under native tree species, preserving biodiversity.]]
[[Agroforestry]] provides many examples of reconciliation ecology at work. In tropical agroforestry systems, crops such as [[coffee]] or fruit trees are cultivated under a canopy of shade trees, providing habitat for tropical forest species outside of protected areas.&lt;ref name=bhagwat&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhagwat|first=S. A. |author2=K. J. Willis |author3=H. J. B. Birks |author4=R. J. Whittaker|title=Agroforestry: a refuge for tropical biodiversity?|journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|year=2008|volume=23|pages=261–268|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.01.005|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[shade-grown coffee]] plantations typically have lower tree diversity than unmanaged forests, however they have much higher tree species diversity and richness than other agricultural methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correia|first=M|author2=M. Diabate |author3=P. Beavogui |author4=K. Guilavogui |author5=N. Lamanda |author6=H. d.

The [[oil palm]] (''Elaeis guineensis'') provides another example of the potential of reconciliation ecology.  It is one of the most important and rapidly expanding tropical crops,&lt;ref name="Koh 2008a" /&gt; so lucrative because it is used in many products throughout the world. Unfortunately, oil-palm agriculture is one of the main drivers of forest conversion in Southeast Asia and is devastating for native [[biodiversity]], perhaps even more so than logging.&lt;ref name="Wilcove 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilcove | first1 = D.S. | last2 = Koh | first2 = L.P. | year = 2010 | title = Addressing the threats to biodiversity from oil-palm agriculture | url = | journal = Conservation of Biodiversity | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 999–1007 | doi=10.1007/s10531-009-9760-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, attempts are being made to foster the sustainability of this industry.  As a [[monoculture]], oil palm is subject to potentially devastating attacks from insect pests.&lt;ref name="Koh 2008a"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koh | first1 = L.P. | year = 2008 | title = Can oil palm plantations be made more hospitable for forest butterflies and birds? | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Ecology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 1002–1009 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01491.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koh | first1 = L.P. | year = 2008 | title = Birds defend oil palms from herbivorous insects | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 821–825 | doi=10.1890/07-1650.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies are attempting an [[integrated pest management]] approach which encourages the planting of species that support [[Predation|predators]] and [[parasitoids]] of these insect pests, as well as an active native bird community.&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b" /&gt; Experiments have shown that a functioning bird community, especially at higher densities, can serve to reduce insect herbivory on oil palms, promoting increased crop yields and profits.&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b" /&gt;  Thus, oil palm plantation managers can participate in reconciliation ecology by promoting local vegetation that is beneficial to [[insectivorous]] birds, including maintaining ground plants that serve as nesting sites, thereby protecting natural communities.  Additionally, steps such as maintaining [[riparian buffer zones]] or natural forest patches can help to slow the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] within oil palm plantation landscapes.&lt;ref name="Wilcove 2010" /&gt;  By engaging in these environmentally friendly practices, fewer chemicals and less effort are required to maintain both plantation productivity and [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name="Koh 2008a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koh 2008b" /&gt;

There are many grazing practices that also encourage native biodiversity. In Rosenzweig’s book he uses the example of a rancher in [[Arizona]] who intentionally deepened his cattle ponds in order to save a population of threatened [[leopard frog]]s (''Rana chiricahuensis''), with no detriment to the use of those tanks for cattle,&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; and a similar situation has occurred with the vulnerable [[California tiger salamander]] (''Ambystoma californiense'') in the Central Valley of California. Research has shown that without cattle grazing, many of the remaining [[vernal pool]]s would dry too early for the salamanders to complete their life cycle under global climate change predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pyke|first=C. R.|author2=J. Marty |title=Cattle Grazing Mediates Climate Change Impacts on Ephemeral Wetlands|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2005|volume=19|issue=5|pages=1619–1625|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00233.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Central America, a large percentage of pastureland is fenced using live trees which are not only low maintenance for the farmer, but also provide habitat for birds, bats, and invertebrates which cannot persist in open pastureland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=C.

===Urban systems===
[[File:MEC's green roof among others.jpg|250px|thumb|Green roofs can help maintain species diversity in urban landscapes.]]
[[Urban ecology]] can be included under the umbrella of reconciliation ecology and it tackles biodiversity in cities, the most extreme of human-dominated landscapes. Cities occupy less than 3% of global surface area, but are responsible for a majority of carbon emissions, residential water use, and wood use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=L. R.|title=Eco-Economy: building an economy for the Earth|year=2001|publisher=Norton|location=New York, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities also have unique climatic conditions such as the [[urban heat island]] effect, which can greatly affect biodiversity.&lt;ref name=Grimm&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grimm|first=N. B.|author2=S. H. Faeth |author3=N. E. Golubiewski |author4=C. L. Redman |author5=J. Wu |author6=X. Bai |author7=J. M. Briggs |title=Global Change and the Ecology of Cities|journal=Science|year=2008|volume=319|pages=756–760 | doi = 10.1126/science.1150195|issue=5864|pmid=18258902 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing trend among city managers to take biodiversity into account when planning city development, especially in rapidly growing cities. Cities often have surprisingly high plant biodiversity due to their normally high degree of habitat heterogeneity and high numbers of gardens and green spaces cultivated to include a large variety of species.&lt;ref name=Grimm /&gt; However, these species are often not native, and a large part of the total urban biodiversity is usually made up of exotic species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=G |author2=G. Jiang |author3=Y. Zhou |author4=Q. Liu |author5=Y. Ji |author6=S. Wang |author7=S. Chen |author8=H.

Because cities are so highly impacted by human activities, restoration to the pristine state is not possible, however there are modifications that can be made to increase habitat without negatively impacting human needs. In urban rivers, addition of large woods and floating islands to provide habitat, modifications to walls and other structures to mimic natural banks, and buffer areas to reduce pollutants can all increase biodiversity without reducing the [[flood control]] and water supply services.&lt;ref name=Francis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=R. A.|title=Perspectives on the potential for reconciliation ecology in urban riverscapes|journal=CAB Reviews: Perspectives in Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Nutrition and Natural Resources|year=2009|volume=4|pages=1–20|doi=10.1079/pavsnnr20094073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban green spaces can be re-designed to encourage natural ecosystems rather than manicured [[lawn]]s, as is seen in the [[National Wildlife Federation]]’s Backyard Wildlife Habitat program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tufts, C. and P. Loewer|title=Gardening for wildlife|year=1995|publisher=Rodale Press|location=Emmaus, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peregrine falcon]]s (''Falco peregrinus''), which were once endangered by [[pesticide]] use, are frequently seen nesting in tall urban buildings throughout North America, feeding chiefly on the introduced [[rock dove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cade|first=T|author2=D. Bird |title=Peregrine falcons, Falco peregrinus, nesting in an urban environment: a review|journal=Canadian Field-Naturalist|year=1990|volume=104|pages=209–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steep walls of buildings mimic the cliffs peregrines naturally nest in and the rock doves replace the native prey species that were driven out of urban areas.

===Industrial systems===
{{further|industrial ecology}}
In Florida, the [[Florida manatee]] (''Trichechus manatus latirostris'') uses warm water discharged from power plants as a refuge when the temperature of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] drops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laist|first=D. W.|author2=J. E. Reynolds |title=Florida manatees, warm-water refuges, and an uncertain future|journal=Coastal Management|year=2005|volume=33|pages=279–295|doi=10.1080/08920750590952018|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These warm areas replace the warm springs that manatees once naturally used in the winter. These springs have been drained or cut off from open water by human uses. [[American crocodile]]s (''Crocodylus acutus'') have a similar habitat in the cooling canals of the [[Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station|Turkey Point]] power plant, where an estimated 10% of the total North American population of the species lives.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt;

[[Wastewater treatment]] systems have shown potential for reconciliation ecology on numerous occasions. Man-made wetlands designed to remove nitrogen before runoff from agriculture enters the [[Everglades]] in Florida are used as breeding sites for a number of birds, including the endangered [[wood stork]] (''Mycteria americana'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frederick|first=P.

===Ocean systems===
[[Coral reefs]] have been intensively impacted by human use, including [[overfishing]] and mining of the reef itself. One reconciliation approach to this problem is building [[artificial reef]]s that not only provide valuable habitat for aquatic species, but also protect nearby islands from storms when the natural structure has been mined away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=S|author2=A. J. Edwards |title=An evaluation of artificial reef structures as tools for marine habitat rehabilitation in the Maldives|journal=Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems|year=1998|volume=9|pages=5–21|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0755(199901/02)9:1&lt;5::aid-aqc330&gt;3.0.co;2-u}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even structures as simple as scrap metal and automobiles can be used as habitat, providing added benefits of freeing space in landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brock|first=R. E|author2=J. E. Norris |title=An analysis of four artificial reef designs in tropical waters|journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|year=1989|volume=44|pages=934–941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
Governmental intervention can aid in encouraging private landowners to create habitat or otherwise increase biodiversity on their land. The United States' [[Endangered Species Act]] requires landowners to halt any activities negatively affecting endangered species on their land, which is a disincentive for them to encourage endangered species to settle on their land in the first place.&lt;ref name=winwin /&gt; To help mediate this problem, the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] has instituted safe harbor agreements whereby the landowner engages in restoration on their land to encourage endangered species, and the government agrees not to place further regulation on their activities should they want to reverse the restoration at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilcove|first=D. S|author2=J. Lee |title=Using economic and regulatory incentives to restore endangered species: lessons learned from three new programs|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2004|issue=3|pages=639–645|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00250.x|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has already led to an increase in [[aplomado falcon]]s (''Falco femoralis'') in [[Texas]] and [[red-cockaded woodpecker]]s (''Picoides borealis'') in the Southeastern US.

Another example is the [[US Department of Agriculture]]’s [[Conservation Reserve Program]] (CRP). The CRP was originally put in place to protect soil from erosion, but also has major implications for conservation of biodiversity.  In the program, landowners take their land out of agricultural production and plant trees, shrubs, and other permanent, [[erosion control]]ling vegetation. Unintended, but ecologically significant consequences of this were the reduction of runoff, improved water quality, creation of wildlife habitat, and possible [[carbon sequestration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=C. P|author2=F. Stearns |author3=G. R. Guntenspergen |author4=D. M. Sharpe |title=Ecological benefits of the Conservation Reserve Program|journal=Conservation Biology|year=1993|volume=7|pages=132–139|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1993.07010132.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
While reconciliation ecology attempts to modify the human world to encourage biodiversity without negatively impacting human use, there are still difficulties in getting broad acceptance of the idea. For example, addition of large woods to urban river systems, which provides critical habitat structure for native fish and invertebrates may be seen as "untidy" and a sign of poor management by residents.&lt;ref name=Francis /&gt; Similarly, many suburban areas do not allow long, unkempt lawns that provide useful wildlife habitat because of perceived damage to property values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=P|author2=A. Polderman |author3=T. Birkenholtz |title=Lawns and Toxins: An Ecology of the City|journal=Cities|year=2001|volume=18|pages=369–380|doi=10.1016/S0264-2751(01)00029-4|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many humans have negative feelings toward certain species, especially [[predator]]s such as wolves, which are often based more on perceived risk than actual risk of loss or injury resulting from the animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=K. M|title=Carnivore-Livestock Conflicts: Effects of Subsidized Predator Control and Economic Correlates on the Sheep Industry|journal=Conservation Biology|year=2006|volume=20|pages=751–761|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00336.x|pmid=16909568|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Even with cooperation of the human element of the equation, reconciliation ecology can not help every species. Some animals, such as several species of [[waterfowl]], show strong avoidance behaviors toward humans and any form of human disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gill|first=J. A|author2=K. Norris |author3=W. J. Sutherland |title=Why behavioral responses may not reflect the population consequences of human disturbance|journal=Biological Conservation|year=2001|volume=97|pages=265–268|doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(00)00002-1|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; No matter how nice an urban park is built, the proximity of humans will scare away some birds. Other species must maintain large territories, and barriers that abound in human habitats, such as roads, will stop them from coexisting with humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riley|first=S. P. D|author2=J. P. Pollinger |author3=R. M. Savajot |author4=E. C. York |author5=C. Bromley |author6=T. Fuller |author7=R. K.

There is hence a double social challenge for reconciliation ecology : making people's perception of biodiversity evolve, and then changing relating norms and policies so as to better consider biodiversity as a positive component in our habitat.&lt;ref name="Couvet"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Couvet|first=Denis|last2=Ducarme|first2=Frédéric|title=Reconciliation ecology, from biological to social challenges|journal=Revue d'ethnoécologie|year=2014|volume=6|pages=|doi=10.4000/ethnoecologie.1979 |pmid=|issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Michelangelo Caravaggio 026.jpg|thumb|[[Caravaggio]]'s ''Rest on the Flight into Egypt'' (1594–96)]]

'''Sight-reading''', also called '''''a prima vista''''' (Italian meaning "at first sight"), is the [[reading (activity)|reading]] and performing of a piece of [[music]] or song in [[music notation]] that the performer has not seen before. '''Sight-singing''' is used to describe a singer who is sight-reading. Both activities require the musician to play or sing the notated rhythms and pitches. Many believe that sight-singing is the more challenging of the two, because singers do not have any keys, frets or valves (on keyboard instruments, guitars, and valved brass instruments, respectively) to help them obtain the correct pitches. Singers must also read and sing the correct lyrics, which adds another layer beyond pitch and dynamics. However, difficulty is related both to the instrument and the difficulty of the piece itself. For instance, sight-reading on a polyphonic instrument, such as the classical guitar, can be more challenging due to the fact that the guitarist has to read polyrhythms and polyphonic passages that can often be played in different positions using different frets.

==Terminology==

===Sight-reading===
People in music literature commonly use the term "sight-reading" generically for "the ability to read and produce both instrumental and vocal music at first sight […] the conversion of musical information from sight to sound".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Udtaisuk|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Udtaisuk and some other authors prefer the use of the more specific terms "sight-playing" and "sight-singing" where applicable. This differentiation leaves a third, more restricted use of the term "sight-reading" for the silent reading of music without creating sound by instrument or voice.

Highly skilled musicians can sight-read ''silently''; that is, they can look at the printed music and hear it in their heads without playing or singing (see [[audiation]]).&lt;ref&gt;True sight-reading or sight-singing—not code-deciphering—is actually ''notational'' audiation.&lt;/ref&gt; Less able sight-readers generally must at least hum or whistle in order to sight-read effectively. This distinction is analogous to ordinary prose reading in [[late antiquity]], when the ability to read silently was notable enough for St. [[Augustine]] to comment on it. &lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Manguel|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term ''a prima vista'' is also used, as Italian words and phrases are commonly used in music and music notation. To play a musical piece ''a prima vista'' means to play it 'at first sight'. According to Payne, "the ability to hear the notes on the page is clearly akin to music reading and should be considered a prerequisite for effective performance.... Egregious errors can occur when a student, analyzing a piece of music, makes no effort to play or hear the composition but mechanically processes the notes on the page".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Payne|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to sight-read is important for all musicians, even amateur performers, but with professional [[orchestra]] musicians and [[session musicians]], it is an essential professional skill. Some professional orchestras require sight-reading as part of an audition.

===Sight transposition===
{{main|Sight transposition}}
Some musicians can [[Transposition (music)|transpose]] music during performance to suit particular instruments or vocal ranges, to make the playing of the instrument(s) or singing easier, or a number of other uses.

===Sight-playing===
According to Udtaisuk, "many [authors] use the term sight-playing for instrumental sight-reading performance." However, Udtaisuk and some other authors use the more descriptive term "sightplaying" (or "sight-playing") for instrumental sight-reading, because sight-playing combines two unique skill sets: music reading and music making.

===Sight-singing===
Some authors, according to Udtaisuk, use the term "sight-singing" for vocal sight-reading. As with sight-playing, Udtaisuk advocates and uses the more descriptive term "sightsinging" for vocal sight-reading because sight-singing combines sight-reading and singing skills.

==Psychology==
The ability to sight-read partly depends on a strong [[Short-term memory|short-term musical memory]]. An experiment on sight reading using an [[eye tracker]] indicates that highly skilled musicians tend to look ahead further in the music, storing and processing the notes until they are played; this is referred to as the [[eye–hand span]].

Storage of notational information in working memory can be expressed in terms of the amount of information (load) and the time for which it must be held before being played (latency). The relationship between load and latency changes according to tempo, such that t = x/y, where t is the change in tempo, x is the change in load, and y is the change in latency. Some teachers and researchers have proposed that the eye–hand span can be trained to be larger than it would otherwise be under normal conditions, leading to more robust sight-reading ability.

[[Human memory]] can be divided into three broad categories: long-term memory, sensory memory, and short-term (working) memory. According to the formal definition, working memory is "a system for temporarily storing and managing the information required to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning, reasoning, and comprehension." The paramount feature that distinguishes the working memory from both the long-term and sensory memory is this system's ability to simultaneously process and store information. The knowledge has what is called a
"limited capacity", so there is only a certain amount of information that can be stored and it is easily accessible for only a small window of time after it has been processed, with a recall time block of roughly fifteen seconds to one minute.

Experiments dealing with memory span have been conducted by [[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]] in 1956 that indicated, "Most common number of items that can be stored in the working memory is five plus or minus two.” However, if this information is not retained and stored (“consolidated”) in one's long-term memory, it will fade quickly.

Research indicates that the main area of the brain associated with the working memory is the [[prefrontal cortex]]. The prefrontal cortex is located in the frontal lobe of the brain. This area deals with cognition and contains two major neural loops or pathways that are central to processing tasks via the working memory: the visual loop, which is necessary for the visual component of the task, and the phonological loop, which deals with the linguistic aspects of the task (i.e. repeating the word or phrase). Although the [[hippocampus]], in the temporal lobe, is the brain structure most frequently paired with memories, studies have indicated that its role is more vital for consolidation of the short-term memories into long-term ones than the ability to process, carry out, and briefly recall certain tasks.

This type of memory has specifically come into focus when discussing sight reading, since the process of looking at musical notes for the first time and deciphering them while playing an instrument can be considered a complex task of comprehension. The main conclusion in terms of this idea is that working memory and short-term memory capacity and mental speed are three important predictors for sight reading achievement. Although none of the studies discredits the correlation between the amount of time one spends practicing and musical ability, specifically sight-reading proficiency, more studies are pointing to the level at which one’s working memory functions as the key factor in sight-reading abilities. As stated in one such study, "Working memory capacity made a statistically significant contribution as well (about 7 percent, a medium-size effect). In other words, if you took two pianists with the same amount of practice, but different levels of working memory capacity, it's likely that the one higher in working memory capacity would have performed considerably better on the sight-reading task."

Based on the research and opinions of multiple musicians and scientists, the take home message about one's sight-reading ability and working memory capacity seems to be that “The best sight-readers combined strong working memories with tens of thousands of hours of practice.”

Sight-reading also depends on familiarity with the musical idiom being performed; this permits the reader to recognize and process frequently occurring patterns of notes as a single unit, rather than individual notes, thus achieving greater efficiency. This phenomenon, which also applies to the reading of language, is referred to as [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]]. Errors in sight-reading tend to occur in places where the music contains unexpected or unusual sequences; these defeat the strategy of "reading by expectation" that sight-readers typically employ.

==Professional use==
Studio [[musician]]s (e.g., musicians employed to record pieces for [[Advertising|commercials]], etc.) often record pieces on the first take without having seen them before. Often, the music played on [[television]] is played by musicians who are sight-reading. This practice has developed through intense commercial competition in these industries.

McNerney, jazz musician, professor, and private instructor, describes auditions for [[University of North Texas]] Jazz Lab Bands as being almost completely based on sight-reading: "you walk into a room and see three or four music stands in front of you, each with a piece of music on it (in different styles ...). You are then asked to read each piece in succession."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|McNerney|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This emphasis on sight-reading, according to McNerney, prepares musicians for studio work "playing backing tracks for pop performers or recording [commercials]."  The expense of the studio, musicians, and techs makes sight-reading skills essential.  Typically, a studio performance is "rehearsed" only once to check for copying errors before recording the final track. Many professional big bands also sight-read every live performance. They are known as "rehearsal bands", even though their performance is the rehearsal.

According to Frazier, score reading is an important skill for those interested in the conducting profession and "Conductors such as the late [[Robert Shaw (conductor)|Robert Shaw]] and [[Yoel Levi]] have incredibly strong piano skills and can read at sight full orchestral scores at the piano" (a process which requires the pianist to make an instant [[piano reduction]] of the key parts of the score).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Frazier|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogy==
Although 86% of piano teachers polled rated sight-reading as the most important or a highly important skill, only 7% of them said they address it systematically. Reasons cited were a lack of knowledge of how to teach it, inadequacy of the training materials they use, and deficiency in their own sight-reading skills. Teachers also often emphasize rehearsed reading and repertoire building for successful recitals and auditions to the detriment of sight-reading and other functional skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hardy|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardy reviewed research on piano sight-reading pedagogy and identified a number of specific skills essential to sight-reading proficiency:
* Technical fundamentals in reading and [[Fingering (music)|fingering]]
* [[Creative visualization|Visualization]] of keyboard topography
* [[Touch|Tactile]] facility (psychomotor skills) and memory
* Ability to read, recognize, and remember groups of notes (directions, patterns, phrases, [[chord (music)|chords]], [[rhythm]]ic groupings, [[theme (music)|themes]], [[Inversion (music)|inversions]], [[interval (music)|intervals]], etc.)
* Ability to read and remember ahead of playing with more and wider progressive fixations
* Aural imagery (ear-playing and sight-singing improves sight-reading)
* Ability to keep the basic pulse, read, and remember rhythm
* Awareness and knowledge of the music's structure and theory

Beauchamp (1999) identifies five building blocks in the development of piano sight-reading skills:
# [[Grand staff|Grand-staff]] knowledge
# Security within the five finger positions
# Security with keyboard topography
# Security with basic accompaniment patterns
# Understanding of basic fingering principles

Grand-staff knowledge consists of fluency in both clefs such that reading a note evokes an automatic and immediate physical response to the appropriate position on the keyboard. Beauchamp asserts it is better to sense and know where the note is than what the note is. The performer does not have time to think of the note name and translate it to a position, and the non-scientific [[Musical note|note]] name does not indicate the [[octave]] to be played. Beauchamp reports success using a Key/Note Visualizer, note-reading flashcards, and computer programs in group and individual practice to develop grand-staff fluency.

Udtaisuk also reports that a sense of keyboard geography and an ability to quickly and efficiently match notes to keyboard keys is important for sight-reading. He found that "computer programs and flash cards are effective ways to teach students to identify notes [and] enhance a sense of keyboard geography by highlighting the relationships between the keyboard and the printed notation."

Most students do not sight-read well because it requires specific instruction, which is seldom given. A major challenge in sight-reading instruction, according to Hardy, is obtaining enough practice material. Since practicing rehearsed reading does not help improve sight-reading, a student can only use a practice piece once. Moreover, the material must be at just the right level of difficulty for each student, and a variety of styles is preferred. Hardy suggests music teachers cooperate to build a large lending library of music and purchase inexpensive music from garage sales and store sales.

==Assessment and standards==
In some circumstances, such as examinations, the ability of a student to sight-read is assessed by presenting the student with a short piece of music, with an allotted time to peruse the music, then testing the student on the accuracy of the performance.  A more challenging test requires the student to perform without any preparation at all.

The [[Washington Assessment of Student Learning]] has piloted a classroom based assessment which requires 5th and higher grade students to sight-sing or perform on instruments from sheet music they have written. It is suggested that students use [[solfege]] or numbering systems or fingering without instruments as aids. 8th graders are expected to sing by sight: "Students are asked to perform a sight-singing exercise of four measures of music. Students will be assessed on their understanding of rhythm and steady beat and their ability to perform in the designated key with accurate interval changes, acappella."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.k12.wa.us/assessment/WASL/Arts/CBPANewRevised2009.aspx "Arts Revised Classroom-Based Performance Assessment (CBPA)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many students and adults cannot sight-sing, and even some professional singers cannot sing by sight.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} However, in combination with an assessment which requires composing music on a staff as early as 5th grade, it is hoped that such a requirement will raise arts achievement. Pilot data show that many students can meet or exceed such standards.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

The Standard Assessment of Sight Reading (SASR) is a non-subjective sight reading evaluation method. It was created with a scientific/electronic platform to insure a non-subjective approach to grading and administering that test.  It consists of several thousand pieces of music over 80 graded levels of difficulty that have been reviewed by 135 teachers and students to ascertain the correct difficulty levels.  Their scores were averaged electronically in order to insure a scientific approach to graduating the difficulty levels of the music.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7758">'''Superiorization''' is an [[iterative method]] for [[constrained optimization]]. It is used for improving the efficacy of an iterative method whose convergence is resilient to certain kinds of perturbations. Such perturbations are designed to "force" the perturbed [[algorithm]] to produce more useful results for the intended application than the ones that are produced by the original iterative algorithm. The perturbed algorithm is called the '''superiorized version''' of the original unperturbed algorithm. If the original algorithm is computationally efficient and useful in terms of the target application and if the perturbations are inexpensive to calculate, the method may be used to steer iterates without additional computation cost.

== Areas of application ==
The superiorization methodology is very general and has been used successfully in many important practical applications, such as [[iterative reconstruction]] of images from their projections,&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;G.T.

== Objective function reduction and relation with constrained optimization ==
An important case of superiorization is when the original algorithm is "feasibility-seeking" (in the sense that it strives to find some point in  a [[feasible region]] that is compatible with a family of constraints) and the perturbations that are introduced into the original iterative algorithm aim at reducing (not necessarily minimizing) a given merit function. In this case, superiorization has a unique place in [[optimization]] theory and practice. 

Many [[constrained optimization]] methods are based on methods for unconstrained optimization that are adapted to deal with constraints. Such is, for example, the class of projected gradient methods wherein the unconstrained minimization inner step "leads" the process and a projection onto the whole constraints set (the feasible region) is performed after each minimization step in order to regain feasibility. This projection onto the constraints set is in itself a non-trivial optimization problem and the need to solve it in every iteration hinders projected gradient methods and limits their efficacy to only feasible sets that are "simple to project onto". Barrier methods or [[penalty methods]] likewise are based on unconstrained optimization combined with various "add-on"s that guarantee that the constraints are preserved. Regularization methods embed the constraints into a "regularized" [[objective function]] and proceed with unconstrained solution methods for the new regularized objective function.

In contrast to these approaches, the superiorization methodology can be viewed as an antipodal way of thinking. Instead of adapting unconstrained minimization algorithms to handling constraints, it adapts feasibility-seeking algorithms to reduce merit function values. This is done while retaining the feasibility-seeking nature of the algorithm and without paying a high computational price. Furthermore, general-purpose approaches have been developed for automatically superiorizing iterative algorithms for large classes of constraints sets and merit functions; these provide algorithms for many application tasks.

'''Qazi Syed Hayatullah''' (died c. 1135 AH / 1722 AD) was a Muslim scholar of [[Fiqh]] from Sakras, District [[Gurgaon]] ([[Haryana]], India). He belonged to the family of [[Gardēzī Sadaat]].

==Biography==
Qazi Syed Hayatullah was a scholar of [[Fiqh]], an expert in [[sharia]] laws, from Sakras, District [[Gurgaon]] ([[Haryana]]). He was also a good orator and stayed at [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] for a long time, where he gained both name and fame in teaching Fiqh. At Sakras, he built a rich library after collecting large number of books. He also built his own beautiful [[Haveli]] at [[Mohallah]] Sayidwadi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher = Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences|publication-place = ʻAlīgaṛh |author = Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman| pages = 43–47 (Qazi Syed Hayatullah) | url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL3006896M/Ḥayāt-i_Karam_Ḥusain |title = Ḥayāt-i Karam Ḥusain |publication-date = 1983, revised second edition 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
His ancestors Syed Shamsuddin Sani (alias Syed Chajju Jagat Jaut ibn Mir Imaduddin ibn Syed Shamsuddin) came to India during the reign of Sultan Shams-ud-din [[Iltutmish]] (1211–1235).

Like his father [[Qazi Syed Inayatullah]], his wife also belonged to [[Pinangwan]]. He had one daughter, who was married to Mohammad Ammad of [[Pinangwan]], and two sons: Syed Mohammad Zaman and Syed Mohammad Mureed.

Syed Mohammad Zaman was affirmed [[Qazi]] after his father.
{{main|Qazi Syed Mohammad Zaman}}

Syed Mohammad Mureed had a horse business. He was not only a good horse rider but also an expert in [[Archery]]. He, most of the times, stayed in [[Ujjain]] and hence after death also buried near Ujjain at Dargah Shah Mahmood, Ghalla Mandi along with his father-in-law Mohammad Ikram and brother-in-law Abu Ishaq. Syed Mohammad Mureed with his wife Noorun Nisan had one son Mohammad Muneer and three daughters, Bibi Sahiba, Jamiatun Nisan and Sahibun Nisan. Bibi Sahiba was married to Mohammad Aziz ibn Mohammad Azim (husband of Bibi Khadija daughter of Mohammad Asadullah), while Jamiatun Nisan and Sahibun Nisan were married to Abu Turab (son of Qazi Ghulam Murtaza) and Mohammad Munawwar (son of Mohammad Adil) respectively. Jamiatun Nisan had one daughter Jamal Daulat and two sons Mian Mohammad Yar and Mohammad Hasan. Mohammad Hasan along with Ghulam Qutubuddin, was killed in a battle with [[Ahirs]] on 26 August 1797 at [[Rewari]]. In the same battle, another relative to Mohammad Hasan, Syed Hisamuddin with his colleague Ahmad Beg Khan was also killed by [[Ahirs]] and their graves are located besides the wall of Masjid located inside the fort. The son of Mohammad Hasan, Ghulam Saroor was a prominent physician who died in [[Mecca]], after performing [[Hajj]] on 11 [[Moharram]] 1294 AH. Mian Mohammad Yar (born 1176 AH / 1762 AD) was quite a religious person and was married to Wajihun Nisan (daughter of Shah Abul Ghais). The son of Mohammad Yar Mohammad Ali was married to Sahibun Nisan (daughter of Shah Mohammad Shoeb).

Mohammad Muneer was married to the daughter of Syed Aminuddin ibn Syed Nasiruddin and had one daughter Fahamun Nisan, who was married to Mohammad Rasheed (died 10 [[Rabi' al-awwal]] 1203 AH/1788 AD). Fahamun Nisan had two sons – Aulad Ali and Murad Ali. Both had good business of horses. The daughter of Murad Ali, Fahimun Nisan was married on 12 [[Shawwal]] 1246 AH / 1830 AD with Aminuddin ibn Fasihuddin. While returning from [[Hajj]] in 1852, Aminuddin died as a result of a [[storm surge]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].

'''Thermal science''' is the combined study of [[thermodynamics]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[heat transfer]], and [[combustion]].

==Overview==
Introductory subjects studied in thermal science generally are focused on [[thermodynamics]].  These include studies of properties of pure substances, pressure-volume-temperature diagrams, the [[ideal gas law]], [[heat]] and its relationship to [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], [[heat transfer]], the [[laws of thermodynamics]], [[Heat engine|engine]] and [[refrigeration]] cycles, and [[combustion]].

Another area of concern in thermal science is [[fluid mechanics]]. These include [[fluid statics]], fluid flows, e.g. [[laminar flow]] vs. [[turbulent flow]], the [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli equation]]. The applicability of this area is piping networks, turbo-machineries, airfoils.

[[Heat transfer]] has applications for [[heat exchangers]], [[heat engines]], [[HVAC|heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning]], and cooling of [[microelectronics]].

[[Combustion]] involves both thermal effects and chemical reaction.

Intensive study of thermal sciences requires additional knowledge and experience in other areas such as [[Experiment|experimental techniques]] and [[Numerical analysis|numerical or computational methods]].

&lt;/ref&gt; of [[High-mountain Asia]]. The plateau is bordered to the south by the [[Himalayas|inner Himalayan range]], to the north by the [[Kunlun Mountains]], which separate it from the [[Tarim Basin]], and to the northeast by the [[Qilian Mountains]], which separate the plateau from the [[Hexi Corridor]] and [[Gobi Desert]]. To the east and southeast the plateau gives way to the forested gorge and ridge geography of the mountainous headwaters of the [[Salween River|Salween]], [[Mekong]], and [[Yangtze]] rivers in northwest [[Yunnan]] and western [[Sichuan]] (the [[Hengduan Mountains]]).  In the west the curve of the rugged [[Karakoram]] range of northern [[Kashmir]] embraces the plateau. The [[Indus River]] originates in the western Tibetan Plateau in the vicinity of [[Lake Manasarovar]].

[[File:Aba County Aba Prefecture Sichuan China.jpg|thumb|[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] [[stupa]] and houses outside the town of [[Ngawa Town|Ngawa]], on the Tibetan Plateau.|upright=1.2]]
The Tibetan Plateau is bounded in the north by a broad escarpment where the altitude drops from around {{convert|5000|m}} to {{convert|1500|m}} over a horizontal distance of less than {{convert|150|km}}. Along the escarpment is a range of mountains. In the west the [[Kunlun Mountains]] separate the plateau from the Tarim Basin. About halfway across the Tarim the bounding range becomes the [[Altyn-Tagh]] and the Kunluns, by convention, continue somewhat to the south. In the 'V' formed by this split is the western part of the [[Qaidam Basin]]. The Altyn-Tagh ends near the Dangjin pass on the [[Dunhuang]]-[[Golmud]] road. To the west are short ranges called the Danghe, Yema, Shule, and Tulai Nanshans. The easternmost range is the Qilian Mountains. The line of mountains continues east of the plateau as the [[Qinling]], which separates the [[Ordos Plateau]] from Sichuan. North of the mountains runs the Gansu or [[Hexi Corridor]] which was the main silk-road route from [[China proper]] to the West.

The plateau is a high-altitude arid [[steppe]] interspersed with mountain ranges and large [[brackish water|brackish]] lakes. Annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|100|to|300|mm|in}} and falls mainly as hail. The southern and eastern edges of the steppe have grasslands which can sustainably support populations of nomadic herdsmen, although frost occurs for six months of the year. [[Permafrost]] occurs over extensive parts of the plateau. Proceeding to the north and northwest, the plateau becomes progressively higher, colder and drier, until reaching the remote [[Changtang]] region in the northwestern part of the plateau. Here the average altitude exceeds {{convert|5000|m}} and winter temperatures can drop to {{convert|−40|°C}}. As a result of this extremely inhospitable environment, the Changthang region (together with the adjoining Kekexili region) is the least populous region in Asia, and the third least populous area in the world after [[Antarctica]] and northern [[Greenland]].

== Geology and geological history ==
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
{{Main article|Geology of the Himalaya}}
[[File:Lake Yamdroktso.jpg|thumb|[[Yamdrok Lake]] is one of the three largest sacred lakes in Tibet.|upright=1.2]]
The geological history of the Tibetan Plateau is closely related to that of the Himalayas. The Himalayas are among the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consist mostly of uplifted [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rock]]. Their formation is a result of a [[continental collision]] or [[orogeny]] along the [[convergent boundary]] between the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] and the [[Eurasian Plate]].

The collision began in the [[Cretaceous|Upper Cretaceous]] period about 70 million years ago, when the north-moving [[Indo-Australian Plate]], moving at about {{Convert|15|cm|4=0|abbr=on}} per year, collided with the [[Eurasian Plate]]. About 50 million years ago, this fast moving Indo-Australian plate had completely closed the [[Tethys Ocean]], the existence of which has been determined by [[sedimentary rock]]s settled on the ocean floor, and the [[volcano]]es that fringed its edges. Since these sediments were light, they crumpled into mountain ranges rather than sinking to the floor. The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards; the plateau is still [[tectonic uplift|rising]] at a rate of approximately {{Convert|5|mm|4=1|abbr=on}} per year.

Much of the Tibetan Plateau is of relatively low relief. The cause of this is debated among geologists. Some argue that the Tibetan Plateau is an uplifted [[peneplain]] formed at low altitude, while others argue that the low relief stems from [[erosion]] and [[sedimentary basin|infill]] of topographic depressions that occurred at already high elevations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Lia, Jijun; Ma, Zhenhua; Li, Xiaomiao; Peng, Tingjiang; Guo, Benhong; Zhang, Jun; Song, Chunhui; Liu, Jia; Hui, Zhengchuang; Yu, Hao; Ye, Xiyan; Liu, Shanpin; Wang Xiuxi |date=2017 |title = Late Miocene-Pliocene geomorphological evolution of the Xiaoshuizi peneplain in the Maxian Mountains and its tectonic significance for the northeastern Tibetan Plateau |url= |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=295 |issue= |pages=393–405 |doi= 10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.07.024|pmc= |pmid= |access-date=|name-list-format=|bibcode=2017Geomo.295..393L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==
The Tibetan Plateau supports a variety of ecosystems, most of them classified as [[montane grasslands]].  While parts of the plateau feature an [[alpine tundra]]-like environment, other areas feature monsoon-influenced shrublands and forests. [[Species diversity]] is generally reduced on the plateau due to the elevation of low precipitation. The Tibetan Plateau hosts species of [[gray wolf]], [[snow leopard]], [[wild yak]], [[Donkey#Feral donkeys and wild asses|wild donkey]], [[Crane (bird)|cranes]], [[vulture]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[snake]]s, and [[water buffalo]]. One notable animal is the [[Euophrys omnisuperstes|high-altitude jumping spider]], that can live at elevations of over {{convert|6500|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/natureofthings/2008/wildchina/wildchina3.html|title=Wild China: The Tibetan Plateau|website=The Nature of Things|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Company|accessdate=2013-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ecoregion]]s found on the Tibetan Plateau, as defined by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], are as follows:
* The [[Pamir alpine desert and tundra]] covers the western end of the Tibetan Plateau where it transitions to the [[Pamir Mountains]]
* The [[North Tibetan Plateau-Kunlun Mountains alpine desert]] covers the northwestern limits of the Tibetan Plateau along the [[Kunlun Mountains]]
* The [[Karakoram-West Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe]] covers the westernmost parts of the Tibetan Plateau and [[Ladakh]]
* The [[Northwestern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows]] on the edges mountains bordering the extreme west of the Tibetan Plateau
* The [[Central Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe]] covers most of the central portions of the Tibetan Plateau and the eastern [[Changtang]]
* The [[Western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows]] covers the southwestern plateau in the [[Garuda Valley]] region
* The [[Qaidam Basin semi-desert]] located in the [[Qaidam Basin]] on the northern Tibetan Plateau
* The [[Qilian Mountains subalpine meadows]] covering the [[Qilian Mountains]] in the northernmost portions of the plateau
* The [[Qilian Mountains conifer forests]] covering parts of the mountain ranges in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau
* The [[Tibetan Plateau alpine shrub and meadows]] covering a swath of the central and northeastern Tibetan Plateau
* The [[Yarlung Tsangpo arid steppe]] in the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River|Yarlung Tsangpo River Valley]], where most of the permanent human population on the Tibetan Plateau lives
* The [[Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows]] cover the southern Tibetan Plateau on the north side of the [[Himalayas]]
* The [[Southeast Tibet shrub and meadows]] cover the southeastern and eastern parts of the plateau and are generally rainier than the other high-altitude Tibetan Plateau regions
* The [[Northeastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests]] reach up mountain valleys in the southern plateau and contain some of the highest altitude forests in the world
* The [[Nujiang Langcang Gorge alpine conifer and mixed forests]] cover the mountain valleys that reach {{cvt|500|km|mi}} into the southeastern Tibetan Plateau
* The [[Hengduan Mountains subalpine conifer forests]] cover the southeasternmost mountain valleys on the plateau
* The [[Qionglai-Minshan conifer forests]] cover the eastern edges of the plateau and are the densest forests to be found anywhere on the Tibetan Plateau

== Impact on other regions ==
=== Role in monsoons ===
{{Main article|Monsoon}}
[[File:Jewel-Toned Lakes of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.jpg|thumb|Natural-colour satellite image of the Tibetan Plateau|upright=1.2]]

Monsoons are caused by the different amplitudes of surface temperature seasonal cycles between land and oceans. This differential warming happens because heating rates differ between land and water. Ocean heating is distributed vertically through a "mixed layer" that may be fifty meters deep through the action of wind and buoyancy-generated [[turbulence]], whereas the land surface conducts heat slowly, with the seasonal signal penetrating only a meter or so. Additionally, the [[specific heat capacity]] of liquid water is significantly greater than that of most materials that make up land. Together, these factors mean that the heat capacity of the layer participating in the seasonal cycle is much larger over the oceans than over land, with the consequence that the land warms and cools faster than the ocean. In turn, air over the land warms faster and reaches a higher temperature than does air over the ocean.&lt;ref name="Oracle"&gt;Oracle Thinkquest Education Foundation. [http://library.thinkquest.org/C003603/english/monsoons/causesofmonsoons.shtml monsoons: causes of monsoons.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416181043/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003603/english/monsoons/causesofmonsoons.shtml |date=16 April 2009 }} Retrieved on 22 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The warmer air over land tends to rise, creating an area of [[low pressure]]. The pressure anomaly then causes a steady wind to blow toward the land, which brings the moist air over the ocean surface with it. Rainfall is then increased by the presence of the moist ocean air. The rainfall is stimulated by a variety of mechanisms, such as low-level air being lifted upwards by mountains, surface heating, convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows near the surface. When such lifting occurs, the air cools due expansion in lower pressure, which in turn produces [[condensation]] and precipitation.

In winter, the land cools off quickly, but the ocean maintains the heat longer. The hot air over the ocean rises, creating a low-pressure area and a breeze from land to ocean while a large area of drying high pressure is formed over the land, increased by wintertime cooling.&lt;ref name="Oracle"/&gt; Monsoons are similar to [[sea breezes|sea and land breezes]], a term usually referring to the localized, [[diurnal cycle]] of circulation near coastlines everywhere, but they are much larger in scale, stronger and seasonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[BBC]] Weather|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041101181531/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/monsoon.shtml|archivedate=2004-11-01|title= The Asian Monsoon|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/monsoon.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seasonal monsoon wind shift and weather associated with the heating and cooling of the Tibetan plateau is the strongest such monsoon on Earth.

==Glaciology: the Ice Age and at present==
[[Image:Himalayas.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Himalayas as seen from space looking south from over the Tibetan Plateau.]]
Today, Tibet is an important heating surface of the atmosphere. However, during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], an approximately {{convert|2400000|km2|sqmi}} ice sheet covered the plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Matthias|last=Kuhle|year=1998|title=Reconstruction of the 2.4 Million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Late Pleistocene Ice Sheet on the Tibetan Plateau and its Impact on the Global Climate|journal=Quaternary International|volume=45/46|pages=71–108|doi=10.1016/S1040-6182(97)00008-6|bibcode=1998QuInt..45...71K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhle|first=M|year=2004|chapter=The High Glacial (Last Ice Age and LGM) ice cover in High and Central Asia|title=Development in Quaternary Science 2c (Quaternary Glaciation – Extent and Chronology, Part III: South America, Asia, Africa, Australia, Antarctica)|editor1-last=Ehlers|editor1-first=J.|editor2-last=Gibbard|editor2-first=P.L.|pages=175–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=K1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhle|first=M.|year=1999|journal=GeoJournal|volume=47|issue=1–2|title=Tibet and High Asia V.

See chapter entitled: "Reconstruction of an approximately complete Quaternary Tibetan Inland Glaciation between the Mt. Everest and Cho Oyu Massifs and the Aksai Chin. – A new glaciogeomorphological southeast-northwest diagonal profile through Tibet and its consequences for the glacial isostasy and Ice Age cycle".&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its great extent, this glaciation in the subtropics was an important element of [[radiative forcing]]. With a much lower latitude, the ice in Tibet reflected at least four times more radiation energy per unit area into space than ice at higher [[latitude]]s. Thus, while the modern plateau heats the overlying atmosphere, during the Last Ice Age it helped to cool it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhle|first=M.|year=1988|title=The Pleistocene Glaciation of Tibet and the Onset of Ice Ages – An Autocycle Hypothesis|journal=GeoJournal|volume=17|issue=4|id=Tibet and High-Asia I. Results of the Sino-German Joint Expeditions (I)|pages=581–96|doi=10.1007/BF00209444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This cooling had multiple effects on regional climate. Without the [[thermal low]] pressure caused by the heating, there was no [[monsoon]] over the Indian subcontinent. This lack of monsoon caused [[pluvial|extensive rainfall]] over the [[Sahara]], expansion of the [[Thar Desert]], more dust deposited into the [[Arabian Sea]], and a lowering of the [[life zone|biotic life zones]] on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Animals responded to this shift in climate, with the [[Javan rusa]] migrating into India.&lt;ref name=K2001&gt;{{cite journal|first=Matthias|last=Kuhle|year=2001|title=The Tibetan Ice Sheet; its Impact on the Palaeomonsoon and Relation to the Earth's Orbital Variations|journal=Polarforschung|volume=71|pages=1–13|issue=1/2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the glaciers in Tibet created [[glacial lake|meltwater lakes]] in the [[Qaidam Basin]], the [[Tarim Basin]], and the [[Gobi Desert]], despite the strong [[evaporation]] caused by the low latitude. [[Rock flour|Silt]] and clay from the glaciers accumulated in these lakes; when the lakes dried at the end of the ice age, the silt and clay were [[aeolian processes|blown]] by the [[katabatic wind|downslope wind]] off the Plateau. These airborne fine grains produced the enormous amount of [[loess]] in the Chinese lowlands.&lt;ref name=K2001/&gt;

===Effect of climate change===
The Tibetan Plateau contains the world's third-largest store of ice. Qin Dahe, the former head of the [[China Meteorological Administration]], issued the following assessment in 2009:
{{quote|Temperatures are rising four times faster than elsewhere in China, and the Tibetan glaciers are retreating at a higher speed than in any other part of the world. [...] In the short term, this will cause lakes to expand and bring floods and mudflows. [...] In the long run, the glaciers are vital lifelines for Asian rivers, including the Indus and the Ganges. Once they vanish, water supplies in those regions will be in peril.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g1eE4Xw3njaW1MKpJRYOch4hOdLQ |title = Global warming benefits to Tibet: Chinese official |date=2009-08-18 |agency = AFP }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Tracheids''' are elongated [[cell (biology)|cell]]s in the [[xylem]] of [[vascular plant]]s that serve in the transport of water and mineral salts. Tracheids are one of two types of [[tracheary element]]s, [[vessel element]]s being the other. Tracheids, unlike vessel elements, do not have [[Glossary of botanical terms#perforation plate|perforation plates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Esau |first=K. |year=1977 |title=Anatomy of Seed Plants |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |edition=2nd |isbn=0-471-24520-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All tracheary elements develop a thick lignified cell wall, and at maturity the [[protoplast]] has broken down and disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter A. Raven |author2=Ray F. Evert |author3=Susan E. Eichhorn |year=1999|title=Biology of Plants|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company|pages=576–577|isbn=1-57259-611-2|nopp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of tracheary elements is the defining characteristic of vascular plants to differentiate them from [[non-vascular plant]]s. The two major functions that tracheids may fulfill are contributing to the transport system and providing structural support. The secondary walls have thickenings in various forms—as annular rings; as continuous helices (called helical or spiral); as a network (called reticulate); as transverse nets (called scalariform); or, as extensive thickenings except in the region of pits (called pitted).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://preuniversity.grkraj.org/html/3_PLANT_ANATOMY.htm |title=Plant Cell Biology: Pre-University |chapter=Plant anatomy |author=G.

Tracheids provide most of the structural support in [[softwood]]s, where they are the major cell type.

Because tracheids have a much higher surface to volume ratio compared to vessel elements, they serve to hold water against gravity (by [[adhesion]]) when [[transpiration]] is not occurring. This is likely one mechanism that helps plants prevent [[air embolism]]s.

The term "tracheid" was introduced by Carl Sanio in 1863, originally as ''Tracheide'', in German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sanio |first=C. |year=1863 |title=Vergleichende Untersuchungen über die Elementarorgane des Holzkörpers |journal=Bot.

'''Tunnel warfare''' is a general name for [[war]] being conducted in [[tunnels]] and other underground cavities.  It often includes the construction of underground facilities ('''mining''' or '''undermining''') in order to attack or defend, and the use of existing natural caves and artificial [[Subterranea (geography)|underground facilities]] for military purposes. Tunnels can be used to undermine [[fortification]]s and slip into enemy territory for a [[surprise attack]], while it can strengthen a [[defence (military)|defence]] by creating the possibility of [[ambush]], [[counterattack]] and the ability to transfer troops from one portion of the battleground to another unseen and protected.  Also, tunnels can serve as shelter for [[combatants]] and [[non-combatants]] from enemy attack.

Since [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], [[sapper]]s have used mining against a [[Defensive wall|walled city]], [[Fortification|fortress]], [[castle]] or other strongly held and [[fortification|fortified military position]].  Defenders have dug '''counter mines''' to attack miners or destroy a mine threatening their fortifications.  Since tunnels are commonplace in [[urban area]]s, tunnel warfare is often a feature, though usually a minor one, of [[urban warfare]].

Tunnels are narrow and restrict [[field of fire (weaponry)|fields of fire]]; thus troops in a tunnel usually have only a few areas exposed to fire or sight at any one time.  They can be part of an extensive [[labyrinth]] and have [[cul-de-sac]]s and reduced [[lighting]], typically creating a closed-in [[night combat]] environment.

==Early times==

===Ancient Greece===
The Greek historian [[Polybius]], in his ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'', gives a graphic account of mining and counter mining at the Roman siege of [[Ambracia]]:

{{quote |The Aetolians [...] offered a gallant resistance to the assault of the [[siege artillery]] and [the Romans], therefore, in despair had recourse to mines and underground tunnels.  Having safely secured the central one of their three works, and carefully concealed the shaft with wattle screens, they erected in front of it a covered walk or stoa about two hundred feet long, parallel with the wall; and beginning digging from that, they carried it on unceasingly day and night, working in relays. For a considerable number of days the besieged did not discover them carrying the earth away through the shaft; but when the heap of earth thus brought out became too high to be concealed from those inside the city, the commanders of the besieged garrison set to work vigorously digging a trench inside, parallel to the wall and to the stoa which faced the towers. When the trench was made to the required depth, they next placed in a row along the side of the trench nearest the wall a number of brazen vessels made very thin; and, as they walked along the bottom of the trench past these, they listened for the noise of the digging outside. Having marked the spot indicated by any of these brazen vessels, which were extraordinarily sensitive and vibrated to the sound outside, they began digging from within, at right angles to the trench, another underground tunnel leading under the wall, so calculated as to exactly hit the enemy's tunnel. This was soon accomplished, for the Romans had not only brought their mine up to the wall, but had under-pinned a considerable length of it on either side of their mine; and thus the two parties found themselves face to face.&lt;ref name=hst2128&gt;[[Polybius]]. ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]''. 21.28&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Aetolian League|Aetolians]] then countered the Roman mine with smoke from burning feathers with charcoal.&lt;ref name=hst2128 /&gt;

Another extraordinary use of siege-mining in ancient Greece was during [[Philip V of Macedon]]'s siege of the little town of [[Prinassos]], according to Polybius, "the ground around the town were extremely rocky and hard, making any siege-mining virtually impossible. However, Philip ordered his soldiers during the cover of night collect earth from elsewhere and throw it all down at the fake tunnel's entrance, making it look like the Macedonians were almost finished completing the tunnels.  Eventually, when Philip V announced that large parts of the town-walls were undermined, the citizens surrendered without delay."&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]]. ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]''. 16.11&lt;/ref&gt;

Polybius also describes the [[Seleucids]] and [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] employing tunnels and counter-tunnels during the siege of Sirynx.&lt;ref&gt; Polyb. 10.31.6-10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman===
The oldest known sources about employing tunnels and trenches for guerrilla-like warfare are [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]. After the uprising in [[Germania]] the insurgent tribes soon started to change defence from only local strongholds into utilising the advantage of wider terrain. Hidden trenches to assemble for surprise attacks were dug, connected via tunnels for secure fallback.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/Strategemata/1*.html#3 Sextus Julius Frontinus; Strategemata: De Constituendo Statu Belli III./10]&lt;/ref&gt; In action often barriers were used to prevent the enemy from pursuing.

[[Roman legion]]s entering the country soon learned to fear this warfare, as the ambushing of marching columns caused high casualties. Therefore, they approached possibly fortified areas very carefully, giving time to evaluate, assemble troops and organize them. When the Romans were themselves on the defensive the large underground [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] system was utilised in the defence of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], as well as to evacuate fleeing leaders.

The use of tunnels as a means of guerrilla-like warfare against the Roman Empire was also a common practice of the Jewish rebels in Judea during the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] (132–136 AD). With time the Romans understood that efforts should be made to expose these tunnels. Once an entrance was discovered fire was lit, either smoking out the rebels or suffocating them to death.

Well-preserved evidence of mining and [[counter-mine|counter-mining]] operations has been unearthed at the fortress of [[Dura-Europos]], which [[Siege of Dura Europos (256)|fell]] to the [[Sassanians]] in 256/7 AD during [[Roman–Persian wars]].

===China===
Mining was a siege method used in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] from at least the [[Warring States]] (481–221 BC) period forward. When enemies attempted to dig tunnels under walls for mining or entry into the city, the defenders used large [[bellows]] (the type the Chinese commonly used in heating up the [[blast furnace]] for smelting [[cast iron]]) to pump smoke into the tunnels in order to suffocate the intruders.&lt;ref name="ebrey 29"&gt;Ebrey, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval warfare ===
In warfare during the [[Middle Ages]], a "mine" was a tunnel dug to bring down castles and other [[fortification]]s. Attackers used this technique when the fortification was not built on solid rock, developing it as a response to [[Rock (geology)|stone]]-built castles that could not be burned like earlier-style wooden forts. A [[tunnel]] would be excavated under the outer defenses either to provide access into the fortification or to collapse the walls. These tunnels would normally be supported by temporary wooden props as the digging progressed. Once the excavation was complete, the attackers would collapse the wall or tower being undermined by filling the excavation with [[Early thermal weapons|combustible material]] that, when lit, would burn away the props leaving the structure above unsupported and thus liable to collapse. Later, [[explosive]]s like [[gunpowder]] were used for even greater effect.

A tactic related to mining is [[sapping]] the wall, where engineers would dig at the base of a wall with crowbars and picks. [[Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay]] recounts how at the battle of [[Carcassonne]], during the [[Albigensian Crusade]], "after the top of the wall had been somewhat weakened by bombardment from [[Petrary|petraries]], our engineers succeeded with great difficulty in bringing a four-wheeled wagon, covered in oxhides, close to the wall, from which they set to work to sap the wall"&lt;ref&gt;les Vaux-de-Cernay, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the siege of Carcassonne, defenders worked to prevent sapping by dumping anything they had down on attackers who tried to dig under the wall. Successful sapping usually ended the battle, since the defenders would no longer be able to defend their position and would surrender, or the attackers could enter the fortification and engage the defenders in close combat.

Several methods resisted or countered undermining. Often the siting of a castle could make mining difficult. The walls of a castle could be constructed either on solid rock or on sandy or water-logged land, making it difficult to dig mines.  A very deep ditch or moat could be constructed in front of the walls, as was done at [[Pembroke Castle]], or even artificial lakes, as was done at [[Kenilworth Castle]].  This makes it more difficult to dig a mine, and even if a breach is made, the ditch or moat makes exploiting the breach difficult.

{{anchor|Counter mine|Counter-mine}}Defenders could also dig counter mines.  From these they could then dig into the attackers' tunnels and [[sortie]] into them to either kill the miners or to set fire to the pit-props to collapse the attackers' tunnel. Alternatively they could under-mine the attackers' tunnels and create a [[camouflet]] to collapse the attackers' tunnels. Finally if the walls were breached, they could either place obstacles in the breach, for example a [[cheval de frise]] to hinder a [[forlorn hope]], or construct a [[coupure]].  The great concentric ringed fortresses, like [[Beaumaris Castle]] on [[Anglesey]], were designed so that the inner walls were ready-built coupures: if an attacker succeeded in breaching the outer walls, he would enter a [[killing field]] between the lower outer walls and the higher inner walls.

== Modern warfare ==
[[File:Mine at Leadfield.JPG|thumb|Example of a [[mine gallery]] with timber roof support]]
Increased firepower that came with the use of [[gunpowder]], [[cordite]] and [[dynamite]] made above ground fortifications very expensive if they should withstand any attack. Fortifications were covered with earth and finally they were built totally underground to protect crews and ammunition. For the purpose of firing, [[artillery]] and [[machine gun]] emplacements had [[Arrowslit|loopholes]].

Such a tunnel fortress was difficult to enter and inside there was no room for the attackers to hide from gunfire and explosives. On the other hand, [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] proved to have a devastating effect.

In [[trench warfare]] with heavily fortified [[stronghold]]s, the tactic of digging and [[Explosive mine|mining]] the enemy positions was used in the [[American Civil War]] during the [[Siege of Petersburg]] and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] during the [[Siege of Port Arthur]]. Extensive mining warfare was conducted by German, French, British and Australian troops on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]], where the largely static frontlines created favourable conditions for mining.

The largest mining operations were conducted in the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]], where specialist [[Royal Engineer tunnelling companies]] placed 22 mines under [[German Empire|German]] lines. 19 were eventually exploded, killing about 10,000 German soldiers. Underground attacks especially broke the morale of the enemy if he was surprised in his secure positions. However, the huge craters that are the results of mining enemy positions could be obstacles during an advance, as was found at Petersburg [[Battle of the Crater]] and the Somme. Tunnels built to secure frontline supply were built in several places on the Western Front.

On the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], the successful [[Brusilov Offensive]] employed tunnel/trenches to allow the Russian troops to start the initial assault very close to the Austrian trenches. During [[World War II]], the [[rapid transit|rapid transit systems]] that existed in many cities became another military consideration.

The lessons of these battles led to the construction of even bigger systems of defence underground, like the [[Maginot line]] or the [[Westwall]] with their own infrastructures.

[[North Korea]], it has been claimed{{By whom|date=July 2013}}, has prepared several transport tunnels with a capacity 10,000 troops per hour for a possible invasion of [[South Korea]]. This melds the defensive tunnel warfare with [[Maneuver warfare|mobile warfare]].

The term '''tunnel war''' or '''tunnel warfare''' (地道战) was first used for the [[guerrilla]] tactic employed by the Chinese in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The tunnel systems were fast and easy to construct and enabled a small force to successfully fight superior enemies.

=== The coming of gunpowder ===
A major change took place in the art of tunnel warfare in the 15th century in Italy with the development of gunpowder to undermine enemy fortifications.

[[Ivan the Terrible]] took [[Kazan]] with the use of gunpowder explosions to undermine its walls.

Many fortresses built counter mine galleries, "hearing tunnels" which were used to listen for enemy mines being built. At a distance of about fifty yards they could be used to detect tunnelling.

The [[Moscow Kremlin]] had such tunnels.

Since the 16th century during assault on enemy positions saps, dug by [[sappers]], began to be used.

The Austrian general of Italian origin [[Raimondo Montecuccoli]] (1609-1680) in his classic work on military affairs described methods of destruction and countering of enemy saps. In his paper on "the assaulting of fortresses" [[Vauban]] (1633-1707) the creator of the French School of Fortification gave a theory of mine attack and how to calculate various saps and the amount of gunpowder needed for explosions.

===19th century===

====Crimean War====
As early as 1840 [[Eduard Totleben]] and [[Schilder-Schuldner]] had been engaged on questions of organisation and conduct of underground attacks. They began to use electric current to disrupt charges. Special boring instruments of complex design were developed.

In the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854-1855)]] underground fighting became immense. At first the allies began digging saps without any precautions. After a series of explosions caused by counter mine action the allies increased the depth of the tunnels but began to meet rocky ground and the underground war had to return to higher levels. During the siege Russian sappers dug 6.8 kilometres of saps and counter mines. During the same period the allies dug 1.3 kilometres. The Russians expended 12 tons of gunpowder in the underground war while the allies used 64 tons. These figures show that the Russians tried to create a more extensive network of tunnels and carried out better targeted attacks with only minimal use of gunpowder. The allies used outdated fuses so that many charges failed to go off. Conditions in the tunnels were severe: wax candles often went out, sappers fainted due to stale air, ground water flooded tunnels and counter mines. The Russians repulsed the siege and started to dig tunnels under the allies fortifications. The Russian success in the underground war was recognised by the allies. [[The Times]] noted that the laurels for this kind of warfare must go to the Russians.

====American Civil War====
{{main article|Battle of the Crater}}
[[File:The photographic history of the Civil War - thousands of scenes photographed 1861-65, with text by many special authorities (1911) (14739914576).jpg|thumb|A Confederate counter mine burrow at Fort Mahone, [[Petersburg, Virginia]]]]
In 1864, during the [[Siege of Petersburg]] by the [[Union Army|Union]] [[Army of the Potomac]], a mine made of {{convert|8,000|lb|kg}} of gunpowder was set off approximately {{convert|20|ft|m|sigfig=1}} under Maj. Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside|Ambrose E. Burnside's]] [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]] sector. The explosion blew a gap in the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] defenses of [[Petersburg, Virginia]], creating a crater {{convert|170|ft|m}} long, {{convert|100|to|120|ft|m}} wide, and at least {{convert|30|ft|m|sigfig=1}} deep. The combat was accordingly known as the [[Battle of the Crater]]. From this propitious beginning, everything deteriorated rapidly for the Union attackers. Unit after unit charged into and around the crater, where soldiers milled in confusion. The Confederates quickly recovered and launched several counterattacks led by Brig. Gen. [[William Mahone]]. The breach was sealed off, and Union forces were repulsed with severe casualties. The horror of this engagement was portrayed in the [[Charles Frazier]] novel, and subsequent [[Anthony Minghella]] movie, ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]''. 

During the [[Siege of Vicksburg]], in 1863, Union troops led by General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] tunnelled under the Confederate trenches and detonated a mine beneath the 3rd Louisiana Redan on June 25, 1863.  The subsequent assault, led by General [[John A. Logan]], gained a foothold in the Confederate trenches where the crater was formed, but the attackers were eventually forced to withdraw.

===20th century===

====World War I====
[[File:Mine-explosion-1916.jpg|thumb|left|Explosion of a mine seen from a French position. 1916]]
Mining saw a brief resurgence as a [[military tactic]] during the [[World War I|First World War]], when army engineers attempted to break the stalemate of [[trench warfare]] by tunneling under [[no man's land]] and laying large quantities of explosives beneath the enemy's trenches.  As in siege warfare, [[tunnel warfare]] was possible due to the static nature of the fighting. 

On the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western]] and [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] during the [[First World War]], the military employed specialist miners to dig tunnels.

On the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]], the high peaks of the Dolomites range were an area of fierce [[mountain warfare]] and [[Mines on the Italian Front (World War I)|mining operations]]. In order to protect their soldiers from enemy fire and the hostile alpine environment, both Austro-Hungarian and Italian military engineers constructed fighting tunnels which offered a degree of cover and allowed better [[Military logistics|logistics support]]. In addition to building [[Dugout (military)|underground shelters]] and covered supply routes for their soldiers, both sides also attempted to break the stalemate of [[trench warfare]] by tunneling under [[no man's land]] and placing explosive charges beneath the enemy's positions. Their efforts in high mountain peaks such as [[Col di Lana]], [[Lagazuoi]] and [[Marmolata]] were portrayed in fiction in [[Luis Trenker]]'s ''[[Mountains on Fire]]'' film of 1931.

On the Western Front, the main objective of tunnel warfare was to place large quantities of explosives beneath enemy defensive positions. When it was detonated, the explosion would destroy that section of the trench. The infantry would then advance towards the enemy front-line hoping to take advantage of the confusion that followed the explosion of an underground mine. It could take as long as a year to dig a tunnel and place a mine. As well as digging their own tunnels, the military engineers had to listen out for enemy tunnellers. On occasions miners accidentally dug into the opposing side's tunnel and an underground fight took place. When an enemy's tunnel was found it was usually destroyed by placing an explosive charge inside.

[[File:Butte de Vauquois.jpg|thumb|Mine craters - ''Butte de Vauquois'' memorial site, [[Vauquois]], France]]
During the height of the underground war on the Western Front in June 1916, [[tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers|British tunnellers]] fired 101 mines or camouflets, while German tunnellers fired 126 mines or camouflets. This amounts to a total of 227 mine explosions in one month - one detonation every three hours.&lt;ref name="durandgrouptunnelling"&gt;[http://www.durandgroup.org.uk/durand_group_tunnelling_information%20pt1.html online], access date 2016-08-03&lt;/ref&gt;  Large battles, like the [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916 (see [[Mines on the first day of the Somme|mines on the Somme]]) and the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] in 1917, were also supported by mine explosions.

[[File:NLS Haig - Smashed up German trench on Messines Ridge with dead.jpg|thumb|right|240px|German trench destroyed by the explosion of a mine in the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]]. Approximately 10,000 German troops were killed when the mines were simultaneously detonated at 3.10 a.m. on 7 June 1917.]]
Well known examples are the [[Mines on the Italian Front (World War I)|mines on the Italian Front]] laid by Austro-Hungarian and Italian miners, where the largest individual mine contained a charge of {{convert|50,000|kg|lb|order=flip}} of [[Nitroglycerin|blasting gelatin]], and the activities of the [[Tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers]] on the Western Front. At the [[First day on the Somme|beginning of the Somme offensive]], the British simultaneously detonated [[Mines on the first day of the Somme|19 mines of varying sizes]] beneath the German positions, including two mines that contained {{convert|40,000|lb|kg}} of explosives. 

In January 1917, [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|General Plumer]] gave orders for [[Mines in the Battle of Messines (1917)|over 20 mines]] to be placed under German lines at [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Messines]]. Over the next five months more than 8,000 metres of tunnel were dug and 450-600 tons of explosive were placed in position. Simultaneous explosion of the mines took place at 3.10 a.m. on 7 June 1917. The blast killed an estimated 10,000 soldiers and was so loud it was heard in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWtunnelling.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021092118/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWtunnelling.htm |archivedate=2011-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The near simultaneous explosions created {{nowrap|19}} large craters and ranks among the [[Largest artificial non-nuclear explosions|largest non-nuclear explosions]] of all time. Two mines were not ignited in 1917 because they had been abandoned before the battle, and four were outside the area of the offensive. On 17 July 1955, a [[lightning]] strike set off one of these four latter mines. There were no human casualties, but one cow was killed. Another of the unused mines is believed to have been found in a location beneath a farmhouse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Tweedie  | first = N. | title = Farmer who is sitting on a bomb | work= [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 2004-01-12 | accessdate = 2010-05-17 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/belgium/1451468/Farmer-who-is-sitting-on-a-bomb.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; but no attempt has been made to remove it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/messines.htm The Battle of Messines, 1917]&lt;/ref&gt; The last mine fired by the British in World War I was near [[Givenchy-en-Gohelle|Givenchy]] on 10 August 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/tunnelcoyre.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510184955/http://www.1914-1918.net/tunnelcoyre.htm |archivedate=2015-05-10 |df= }} accessed 24 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; after which the [[tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers]] concentrated on constructing [[Dugout (shelter)#World War I|deep dugouts]] for troop accommodation.

====World War II====

=====Sino-Japanese war in World War II=====
The Ranzhuang tunnel evolved in the course of fighting back Japanese's mopping-up for the people in the central area of Mainland China, [[Hebei]] province. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]], the [[Chinese communists|Chinese Communist forces]] or local peasant resistance used tunnel war tactics against the Japanese (and later [[Kuomingtang]] during [[Chinese Civil War]]). The tunnels were dug beneath the earth to cover the battlefield with numerous hidden gun holes to make a surprise attack. The holes and entrance usually were hidden beneath a straw mat inside a house, or down a well. This allowed flexible manoeuver or exit.

However, the main disadvantages of tunnel war is that usually the Japanese could fill up the holes or pour water in to suffocate the resistance fighter inside the tunnels. This proved to be a major problem but was later solved by installing filters that would consume the water and poisonous gases. It is said that there were even women and children who voluntarily fought in the tunnels.

This is a famous military facility in China due to the movie ''[[Tunnel War]]'', which is based on the stories happened during fighting Japanese in the tunnel.&lt;ref&gt;http://movie.douban.com/subject/3033864/&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of this war movie, more art pieces were produced and adapted in the same setting.&lt;ref&gt;http://movie.douban.com/subject/5343604/&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the Ranzhuang tunnel site ranked among key heritage preservation unit in China, [[Hebei]] province patriotism education base, national defense education base. Tens of thousands visitors were attracted each year. Most of the villagers were working in tourism service industry, an industry worth US$700,000 each year.

=====Japan-U.S. war in World War II=====
The first to copy tunnel warfare were the [[Japan]]ese themselves. In the battles of the Western Pacific, they would maximize their capabilities by establishing a strong point defense, utilizing cave warfare. The first encounter of the US Marines with this new tactic was the island of [[battle of Peleliu|Peleliu]]. The invading marines suffered twice as many casualties as on [[battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]], where the old Japanese tactic of defending the beach had been employed. The pinnacle of this form of defense, however, can be found on [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]], where the Japanese engineered the whole Mount Suribachi with many tunnels leading to defensive emplacements, or exits for quick counterattacks. Tunnel warfare by the Japanese forced the US Marines to adopt the "blowtorch and corkscrew" tactics to systematically flush out the Japanese defenders, one cave at a time.

====Korean War====
On the Korean Peninsula the underground war reached a massive scale.  From experience in the Second World War the US relied upon aviation.  North Korean forces suffered heavy losses from air strikes which obliged them to construct underground shelters. Initially underground fortifications were built independently by individual units and their placement was chaotic. Subsequently underground fortifications were united into a single system. The extent of the underground war is attested to by the following facts. The length of the front was 250 kilometres while the length of underground tunnels was 500 kilometres. So for every kilometre of front there were two kilometres of underground tunnels. A total of 2,000,000 cubic metres of rock were extracted.

North Korea developed a theory of underground warfare. Manpower, warehouses and small calibre guns were completely housed underground making them less vulnerable to air strikes and artillery.  On the surface the many false targets (bunkers, trenches and decoy entrances to the tunnel system) made it difficult to detect true targets forcing US forces to waste ammunition.  Directly under the surface spacious barracks were built, allowing whole units to be quickly brought to the surface for a short time and as quickly returned to shelter underground.

North Korea even created underground shelters for artillery.  During bombing artillery was rolled into bunkers located inside mountains. When a lull came the guns were rolled back out onto a firing area, fired some shells, and rolled back into the bunker again.  Unlike other examples of underground warfare North Korean troops did not just remain in the tunnels.  North Korean forces were sheltering in the tunnels from the bombing and shelling and awaiting US bayonet attack.  When US forces reached the ground in the area of the tunnels, chosen North Korean units would emerge to engage in hand-to-hand combat taking advantage of their numerical superiority.

Currently North Korean strategy is to construct as many underground facilities as possible for military use in the event of a US attack. The depth of underground facilities reaches 80 to 100 metres making them difficult to destroy even with the use of tactical nuclear weapons.

In the [[Korean War]] the tactic of tunnel warfare was employed by the Chinese forces themselves. "The Chinese resort to tunnel warfare, and the devastating losses to American soldiers, led to the sealing of tunnel entrances by United Nations Command. According to later [[prisoner of war]] interrogations, Chinese officers had killed a number of their own soldiers in the tunnels, because the latter had wished to dig their way out and surrender to the [[United Nations Command]]."&lt;ref&gt;Major Allen D.Reece&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vietnam War====
To maintain a full scale guerrilla war in Southern Vietnam, camouflaged bases were used capable of supplying the guerillas for a long period of time. Throughout Southern Vietnam there were secret underground bases that operated successfully. There are reports that every villager was obliged to dig 90 centimetres of tunnel a day. The largest underground base was the tunnels of [[Cu Chi]] with overall length of 200 miles. To combat the guerillas in the tunnels the US used special forces-[[tunnel rats]].

Part of the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] was based in caves made of [[karst]].

When Vietnam became a French colony again after the Second World War, the Communistic Vietminh started to dig tunnels close to Saigon. After the French army left (they were defeated at [[Dien Bien Phu]]) the tunnels were maintained in case the plausible war with South-Vietnam would start. Ho Chi Minh, leader of North-Vietnam, ordered to expand the tunnels after the Americans entered the war between the North and the South; the tunnels would be used by the [[Viet Cong]]. Systems of tunnels were not occupied temporarily for military purpose, but began to contain whole villages of people living permanently underground. The tunnels were a complete underworld, it was all there; kitchens, hospitals, workshops, sleeping areas, communications, ammunition storage, even some entertainment. The tunnels eventually became a target for American forces because the enemy could hide in it and strike everywhere in the range of the tunnel complex (hundreds of miles) without a single warning and then disappear again.

These tactics were also applied against the Chinese during the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]].

====Afghan War====
An underground war was actively pursued in the [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan War]]. Water pipes extend under the entire Afghan territory. In wartime, Afghans have used these tunnels to hide and also to appear suddenly in the enemies rear. To clear these tunnels Soviet troops used explosives and gasoline. The most famous underground base of the [[Mujahideen]] and then the [[Taliban]] was [[Tora Bora]] - this tunnel system went to a depth of 400 meters and had a length of 25 kilometers. To combat guerillas in tunnels both the Soviet Union and the United States have created special forces.

====Bosnian War====
Between May 1992 and November 1995, during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]] in the [[Bosnian War|Bosnian War the Bosnian Army]] built the [[Sarajevo Tunnel]] in order to link the city of Sarajevo, which was entirely cut off by Serbian forces, with the Bosnian-held territory on the other side of the Sarajevo Airport, an area controlled by the United Nations.  The tunnel linked the Sarajevo neighbourhoods of Dobrinja and Butmir, allowing food, war supplies, and humanitarian aid to come into the city, and people to get out. The tunnel was one of the major ways of bypassing the international arms embargo and providing the city defenders with weaponry.

===21st century===

==== Palestine-Israel war ====

[[File:US Ambassador to Israel Shapiro Visit to Attack Tunnel.webm|thumb|US Ambassador to Israel [[Daniel B. Shapiro|Shapiro]]'s Visit to a Palestinian attack tunnel in 2013.]]
Sometimes the ongoing conflict between [[Israeli Army]] and [[Palestinians]] under the border of Gaza is called tunnel war.

In 2017 the [[Barrier against tunnels along the Israel-Gaza Strip border]] began to be built.  On October 30 an attack tunnel was located within Israeli borders and was detonated. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Islamic-Jihad-threatens-to-build-more-terror-tunnels-reports-12-dead-in-recent-blast-513321&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lebanon-Israeli War====
In July 2006, a group of [[Hezbollah]] fighters crossed from southern Lebanon into northern Israel [[2006 Hezbollah cross-border raid|killing three Israeli soldiers and abducting two]], which started the [[2006 Lebanon War|Lebanon-Israeli war]]. Faced with Israeli's air attacks, Hezbollah needed to create a defensive system that would enable these rocket attacks to continue uninterrupted throughout any conflict with Israel. To do so they created an intricate system of tunnels and underground bunkers, anti-tank units, and explosive-ridden areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thepicaproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/hezbollah-a-decade-of-empowerment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Hezbollah built a sophisticated underground network of tunnels with North Korean assistance, with close resemblance to [[North Korea]]'s own network of tunnels in the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.&lt;ref name="IranianInfluence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/183391#.U9kXAeOSw8k North Korea, Iran Held Responsible for Hezbollah Rocket Fire], 7/27/2014&lt;/ref&gt; The underground network included twenty five kilometer underground tunnels, bunkers, fiber optics communication systems, and storerooms to hold missiles and ammunition.&lt;ref name="IranianInfluence"&gt;[https://understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/20080215_IranianInfluence.pdf Iranian influence in the Levant, Iraq, and Afghanistan], 2008, by Frederick w. Kagan, Kimberly kagan and Danielle pletka&lt;/ref&gt; Its capabilities were extended by [[Iran–Israel proxy conflict|Iranian supply of advanced weaponry]] and in-depth training of Hezbollah fighters.&lt;ref name="IranianInfluence"/&gt;

===Syrian civil war===
During the [[Syrian civil war]], rebel groups like the [[Islamic Front (Syria)|Islamic Front]], [[Al-Nusra]] and [[ISIS]] have dug tunnels and used explosives to attack fixed military positions of the [[Syrian Armed Forces]] and allied militias. A notable example is the attack on the Air Force Intelligence Building in Aleppo where on 4 March 2015, rebel forces detonated a large quantity of explosives in a tunnel dug close to or under the building. The building suffered a partial collapse as a result of the explosion which was immediately followed by an armed rebel assault.&lt;ref name="nytimesSyria"&gt;{{cite web|title=Explosion Levels Hotel Housing Government Troops in Syria|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/09/world/middleeast/syria.html?_r=0|author=Hwaida Saad and Alan Cowell|publisher=New York Times|date=8 May 2014|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lwjSyria"&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic Front kills scores in bombing of Aleppo hotel|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/threat-matrix/archives/2014/05/islamic_front_kills_over_50_in.php

== Famous tunnel war victories ==
*[[Jiaozhuanghu]] (焦庄户) tunnel war in Ranzhuang, [[Hebei]] province, that defeated the Japanese Army in the year 1942, during the Second Sino-Japanese War. It was later made into the movie [[Tunnel War|Didao Zhan]] by the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]].
*[[Củ Chi tunnels]] a complex of over {{convert|200|km}} of tunnel systems that allowed [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|NLF guerrillas]] during the [[Vietnam War]] to keep a large presence relatively close to [[Saigon]].

==Tunnels after war==
Many of the famous war tunnels were later turned into tourist site due to their historic significance in wars. For example, [[Sarajevo Tunnel]] is now converted into a war museum, with 20 meters of the original tunnel open for tourists visit. [[Hebei]] Ranzhuang tunnel is also a famous [[war tourism]] site in China.

[[File:Vietnamese Later Le dynasty script.jpg|thumb|right|Vietnamese Later Le dynasty Chinese character caligraphy style]]
[[File:Vietnamese Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|right|Fonts in the style of Vietnamese Latin calligraphy]]

'''Vietnamese calligraphy''' (Vietnamese Quốc ngữ: thư pháp Việt Nam, Hán Nôm: 書法越南) refers to the [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] traditions of Vietnam.  It can refer to calligraphic works using a variety of scripts, including [[Chinese characters]], [[Chữ nôm]], and the Latin-based [[Quốc ngữ]].  Historically, calligraphers used the former two scripts.  However, due to the adoption of the Latin-based Quốc ngữ, modern Vietnamese calligraphy also uses Roman characters.

Traditional Vietnamese calligraphy is strongly affected by that of China.  As part of the East Asian cultural spheres, Classical Chinese was often used as the written medium of communication, and as a result, Vietnamese calligraphy thus also follows Chinese calligraphy’s standard and use Han script (Chinese language) in many of its writings. For example, during the [[Lý dynasty]], its style was very much similar to China’s [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907), during the [[Trần dynasty]], it was influenced strongly by China’s [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960-1279) and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (1271-1368) dynasties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/life-style/350055/new-book-tells-story-of-vn-calligraphy.html#6ebrFO7wJy6J0uqO.97|title=New book tells story of VN calligraphy|last=|first=|date=|work=Vietnam News|access-date=19 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Nonetheless, over time, Vietnam developed its own styles of calligraphy for writing both Classical Chinese and [[Chữ Nôm|Chữ nôm]]. In [[Lê dynasty|Later Le dynasty]], Vietnam developed a unique style of calligraphy which was called Nam tự (南字）by Phạm Đình Hổ (範廷琥) in his book Vũ Trung Tùy Bút (雨中隨筆)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vũ Trung Tùy Bút|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was first used in bureaucracy only, but later became popular in all writing purposes. It was also called Lệnh Thư (令書) in Việt Sử Toát Yếu (越史撮要) because of its bureaucratic characteristic at first&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Việt Sử Toát Yếu|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In modern times, calligraphy has been done frequently in the Latin-based Quốc Ngữ script, as Chữ nôm and Chinese characters have largely fallen out of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vietnamese neglect Han-Nom heritage|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/sunday/features/220749/vietnamese-neglect-han-nom-heritage.html|accessdate=18 December 2013|newspaper=Viet Nam News|date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quốc Ngữ calligraphy gained popularity during the [[Vietnamese poetry#New poetry movement|New Poetry]] and [[Vietnamese poetry#Free poetry movement|Free Poetry Movements]], due to the increasing popularity of using the Vietnamese vernacular, as well as influence from French literature.  Modern Vietnamese calligraphy is undoubtedly influenced by modern Latin [[cursive]], but is written using the [[ink brush|calligraphy brush]], rather than quill or reed pens as is done in Western calligraphy.  Much as Chinese calligraphy is used to write poems, festive banners, signage, and so on, Vietnamese calligraphy can also serve the same purpose today.

"Virtual Design and Construction BIMs are [[Virtuality|virtual]] because they show [[Computer-based assessment|computer-based]] descriptions of the project. The BIM project model emphasizes those aspects of the project that can be designed and managed, i.e., the ''[[Product (business)|product]]'' (typically a [[building]] or [[Factory|plant]] [and infrastructure]), the ''[[organization]]'' that will define, [[design]], [[construction|construct]] and [[operate]] it, and the ''[[Business process|process]]'' that the organization teams will follow, or POP {{Definition needed|date=March 2018}}. These models are [[logically]] integrated in the sense that they all can access [[Concurrent data structure|shared data]], and if a user highlights or changes an aspect of one, the integrated models can highlight or change the dependent aspects of related models. The models are [[multi-disciplinary]] in the sense that they represent the [[Architect]], [[Engineering]], [[Construction]] (AEC) and [[Owner]] of the project, as well as relevant sub-disciplines. The models are [[Performance test (assessment)|performance models]] in the sense that they predict some aspects of project performance, track many that are relevant, and can show predicted and measured performance in relationship to stated project performance objectives. Some companies now practice the first steps of BIM modeling, and they consistently find that they improve business performance by doing so."&lt;ref&gt;John Kunz &amp; Martin Fischer  "Virtual Design and Construction: Themes, Case Studies and Implementation Suggestions" Stanford University CIFE Working Paper # 97, October 2009. [http://cife.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/WP097_0.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Companies are also now considering developing BIMs in various levels of detail, since depending on the application of BIM, more or less detail is needed, and there is varying modeling effort associated with generating building information models at different levels of detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.autcon.2010.11.027 |title=Analysis of modeling effort and impact of different levels of detail in building information models |year=2011 |last1=Leite |first1=F |last2=Akcamete |first2=A |last3=Akinci |first3=B |last4=Atasoy |first4=G |last5=Kiziltas |first5=S |journal=Automation in Construction |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=601–609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodologies Underpinning VDC ==
Advancements in construction engineering began with the ten volumes on architecture completed by [[Vitruvius]], a 1 century B.C. Roman. Vitruvi laid the foundation for the study of construction.

A principle of construction is the use of an [[Applied ontology]] based in an [[Upper ontology (information science)|Upper ontology]]. In practice these ontologies take on the form of breakdown structures such as the [[Work breakdown structure]]. Usually these breakdown structures form [[Metadata]] to represent a construction activity. In practice, this requires a [[Semantic integration]] approach to construction data so to capture the project status.

The research that formed VDC is based in [[Scientific evidence]]. This was a departure from earlier construction engineering that focused on studies of best practices. This required formulating a [[Hypothesis]] and then testing to validate. A range of methodologies have proven useful in construction engineering research, both [[Qualitative research]] and [[Quantitative research]]. Because construction is difficult to replicate in a controlled setting, the [[Case-based reasoning]] || [[Case study]] and [[Action research]] methodologies prevail. These methodologies have different [[Power of a method]], where the case study is often broad and the action research focused.

A core concept of VDC is the [[Spacetime]]. There are four dimensions, these three space dimensions and then a fourth: time. There are additional dimensions of cost and quality, but the core are these four. These four dimensions in design were first understood by Vitruvi as the importance of perspective and time. Prior to the use of computing, the focus was on the fourth dimension time. In practice, this is the [[Critical path method]]. With advances in computing, the representation of the three dimensions of space has increased. The merging of space and the above discussed ontology formed the  [[Information model]], in the construction engineering field, known as [[Building Information Modeling]]. The combination of space and time in practice is shown by the [[Linear scheduling method]] and in close relation the 4D model.

Computing brought about the advent of the need to align with a software developer. Previously, pencil and paper was forgiving on the mixing of methods from different schools of thought. Software is not as forgiving and to mix software requires this as a goal. This forms the field of [[Interoperability]] research. The practical application is demonstrated by the [[Industry Foundation Classes]].

Today, the most compelling advances in VDC are in computer vision ([[List of computer vision topics]]) and the architecture of transmission (AoT), an object-oriented project lifecycle management process, which acts as a counterpoint to commissioned IoT technologies. [http://cife.stanford.edu/]

An important application of VDC is in the workzone. This is where the construction activities reside, and the workforce is a core component. To create an educated workforce with the technical knowhow to use the technology tools now available, VDC includes the development of advanced [[Vocational education]] topics.

'''Zooarchaeology''' (or '''archaeozoology''') is the branch of [[archaeology]] that studies faunal remains related to ancient people.&lt;ref name="Yohe2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yohe II|first=Robert M.|title=Archaeology: The Science of the Human Past|year=2006|publisher=Pearson|pages=248–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Faunal remains are the items left behind when an animal dies.&lt;ref name="Yohe2006" /&gt; It includes: bones, shells, hair, [[chitin]], scales, hides, proteins and DNA.&lt;ref name="Yohe2006" /&gt;  Of these items, bones and shells are the ones that occur most frequently at [[archaeological sites]] where faunal remains can be found.&lt;ref name="Yohe2006" /&gt;  Most of the time, most of the faunal remains do not survive.&lt;ref name="Yohe2006" /&gt;  They often decompose or break because of various circumstances.&lt;ref name="Yohe2006" /&gt;  This can cause difficulties in identifying the remains and interpreting their significance.&lt;ref name="Yohe2006" /&gt;

==Development==
The development of zooarchaeology in Eastern North America can be broken up into three different periods.&lt;ref name="Landon2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Landon|first=David B.|title=Zooarchaeology and Historical Archaeology: Progress and Prospects|journal=Journal of Archaeological Method and|year=2005|volume=12|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The first being the [[Formative stage|Formative period]] starting around the 1860s, the second being the Systematization period beginning in the early 1950s, and the Integration period which began about 1969.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;  
Full-time zooarchaeologists didn’t come about until the Systematization period.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;  Before that it was just a technique that was applied but not specifically studied.

Zooarchaeological specialists started to come about partly because of a new approach to archaeology known as [[processual archaeology]].&lt;ref name="Thomas1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Kenneth D.|title=Zooarchaeology: Past, Present and Future|journal=World Archaeology|year=1996|volume=28|pages=1–4|doi=10.1080/00438243.1996.9980327|pmid=16475284|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This approach puts more emphasis on explaining why things happened, not just what happened.&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;  [[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] began to specialize in zooarchaeology, and their numbers increased from there on.&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Archeozoölogie-Referentiecollectie-Tibia-RCE.jpg|thumb|A reference collection of shinbones (Tibia) of different animal species helps determining old bones. [[Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed|Dutch Heritage Agency]].]]
Zooarchaeology is primarily used to answer several questions.&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;  These include:
# What was the diet like, and in what ways were the animals used for food?&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;
# Which were the animals that were eaten, in what amounts, and with what other foods?&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;
# Who were the ones to obtain the food, and did the availability of that food depend on age or gender?&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;
# How was culture, such as technologies and behavior, influenced by and associated with diet?&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;
# What purposes, other than food, were animals used for?&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;

Zooarchaeology can also tell us what the environment might have been like in order for the different animals to have survived.&lt;ref name="Thomas1996" /&gt;

In addition to helping us understand the past, zooarchaeology can also help us to improve the present and the future.&lt;ref name="Lyman1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lyman|first=R. L.|title=Applied Zooarchaeology: The Relevance of Faunal Analysis to Wildlife Management|journal=World Archaeology|year=1996|volume=28|pages=110–125|doi=10.1080/00438243.1996.9980334}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Studying how people dealt with animals, and its effects can help us avoid many potential ecological problems.&lt;ref name="Lyman1996" /&gt;  This specifically includes problems involving wildlife management.&lt;ref name="Lyman1996" /&gt;  For example, one of the questions that wildlife preservationists ask is whether they should keep animals facing extinction in several smaller areas, or in one larger area.&lt;ref name="Lyman1996" /&gt;  Based on zooarchaeological evidence, they found that animals that are split up into several smaller areas are more likely to go extinct.&lt;ref name="Lyman1996" /&gt;

==Techniques==
One of the techniques that zooarchaeologists use is close attention to [[taphonomy]].&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;  This includes studying how items are buried and deposited at the site in question, what the conditions are that aid in the preservation of these items, and how these items get destroyed.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;  Then they interpret that information.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;

Another technique that zooarchaeologists use is lab analysis.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;  This analysis can include comparing the skeletons found on site with already identified animal skeletons.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;  This not only helps to identify what the animal is, but also whether the animal was domesticated or not.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;

Yet another technique that zooarchaeologists use is [[Quantification (science)|quantification]].&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;  They make interpretations based on the number and size of the bones.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;  These interpretations include how important different animals might have been to the diet.&lt;ref name="Landon2005" /&gt;

== Limitation of techniques ==
There are limitations to using excavation techniques in studying different kinds of faunal remains. It is difficult to screen or sieve large animals remains, and thus it is hard to recover larger animals and bone fragments. Second, it is hard to collect the remains of all animals species, potentially creating biased and unrepresentative data collection. Third, it is difficult to distinguish the original use and reuse of the land, since different activities can be represented in the same area at different times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woollett|first1=James M.|title=Living in the Narrows: Subsistence Economy and Culture Change in Labrador Inuit Society during the Contact Period|journal=World Archaeology|date=1 January 1999|volume=30|issue=3|pages=370–387|jstor=124958|doi=10.1080/00438243.1999.9980418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prehistory ==
[[File:PazyrikHorseman.JPG|alt=This picture is of a Pazyryk man riding a red horse shown in profile view. The man has black hair and is wearing a flowing red and blue polka dotted cape.|thumb|Carpet exemplifying the image of a Pazyryk horseman in 300 B.C.  The Pazyryk were known as superb horseman please see [[Pazyryk culture]], other findings alongside the horses can be explored in [[Pazyryk burials]].]]
Human-Animal relationships and interactions were diverse during [[Prehistory]] from being a food source to playing a more intimate role in society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Erica|date=2013|title=Archaeology and Animal Persons: Toward a Prehistory of Human-Animal Relations|journal=Environment and Society|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.3167/ares.2013.040108|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals have been used in non-economical ways such as being part of a human burial.  However, the major zooarchaeology has focused on who was eating what by looking at various remains such as bones, teeth, and fish scales.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In the twenty-first century researchers have begun to interpret animals in prehistory in wider cultural and social patterns, focusing on how the animals have affected humans and possible animal agency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   There is evidence of animals such as the [[Mountain Lion]] or the [[Jaguar]] being used for ritualistic purposes, but not being eaten as a food source.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Animal burials date back to prehistory with examples emerging from the [[Mesolithic]] period.  In Sweden at the burial site Skateholm I dogs were found buried with children under eight years old or were found buried by themselves.  Some of the dogs who were buried alone have grave goods similar to their human contemporaries such as flint weapons and deer antlers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meanwhile, during the same time period Skateholm II emerged and was very different than Skateholm I, as dogs were buried along on the North and West boundaries of the grave area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Another burial site in Siberia near [[Lake Baikal|Lake Biakal]] known as the "Lokomotiv" cemetery had a wolf burial among human graves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bazaliiskiy &amp; Savelyev|first=|date=2003|title=The Wolf of Baikal: The "Lokomotiv" Early Neolithic Cemetery in Siberia (Russia)|url=|journal=Antiquity|volume=77|issue=295|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buried together with, but slightly beneath the wolf was a male human skull.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The wolf breed was not native to this area as it was warm and other research for the area shows no other wolf habitation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Bazaliiskiy &amp; Savelyev suggests that the presence and significance of the wolf could possibly reflect human interaction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another example occurred in 300 B.C. in [[Ukok Plateau|Pazyryk]] known as the [[Pazyryk burials]] where ten horses were buried alongside a human male, the horses were fully adorned with saddles, pendants, among other valuables.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The oldest horse as also the horse with the grandest attachments.  Erica Hill, a professor in archaeology, suggests that the burials of prehistory animals can shed light on human-animal relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Significance ==
Zooarchaeology allows researchers to have a more holistic understanding of past human-environment interactions. Whether it is diet, domestication, tool use, or ritual; animal remains reveal so much about the groups that interacted with them. Archaeology provides information on the past which often proves invaluable for understanding the present and preparing for the future.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Terence P. 2013. The archaeology of animal bones. Stroud: History Press. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Zooarchaeology plays a valuable part in contributing to a holistic understanding of the animals themselves, the nearby groups, and the local environments.
