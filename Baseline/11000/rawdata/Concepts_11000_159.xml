The '''aggregate demand–inflation adjustment model''' builds on the concepts of the [[IS–LM model]] and the [[AD–AS model]]s, essentially in terms of changing interest rates in response to fluctuations in inflation rather than as changes in the money supply in response to changes in the price level.

== The model ==

The AD–IA model is a Keynesian method used to explain economic fluctuations.  Essentially, this model is used to show undergraduate students how shifts in demand or shocks to prices can affect real GDP around potential.  The model assumes that when inflation rises the interest rate rises (monetary policy rule).  It also assumes that when real GDP exceeds potential, there is upward pressure on the inflation rate and vice versa.

The model features a downward-sloping demand curve (AD) and a horizontal inflation adjustment line (IA).  The point where the two lines cross is equal to potential GDP.  A shift in either curve will explain the impact on real GDP and inflation in the short run.

===Assumptions===
The AD–IA model depends on the assumption of the monetary policy rule (MPR). The monetary policy rule is that the federal reserve increases interest rates in response to increase in [[inflation]] and vice versa.

===Shifts in demand===
A shift in demand can occur for the following reasons:
* A change in government spending
* A change in consumption
* A change in taxes
* A change in the monetary rule

''Example'':  Suppose the government were to cut taxes.  This would lead to an increase in expenditures and thus an increase in demand.  The demand curve would therefore shift to the right and real GDP would be growing above potential.  The inflation adjustment line would then shift upward (reflecting an increase in the inflation rate) causing a movement along the new demand curve until real GDP was equal to potential.

== More advanced ==
This model is further advanced in higher levels of undergraduate studies.

[[David Romer]] proposed in 2000 that the LM curve be replaced in the [[IS–LM]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Romer |first=David |year=2000 |title=Keynesian Macroeconomics without the LM Curve |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=149–169 |doi=10.1257/jep.14.2.149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Romer suggested that although the Federal Reserve uses [[open market operation]]s to impact the federal funds rate, they are not targeting [[money supply]], but rather the [[interest rate]].  Therefore, he suggests removing the LM curve and replacing it with the MP curve.

==Biography==
She was born on July 24, 1871, as '''Abby Pearce Scott''' in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], to Robert Nicholson Scott (1838&amp;ndash;1887) and Elizabeth Goodale Casey (1844&amp;ndash;1912). Her father and grandfather were Army officers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2BJygCeSLQC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;dq=Abby+Scott+Baker+sons&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_7p7GiaPQAhVDfiYKHQbXBCkQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Abby%20Scott%20Baker%20sons&amp;f=false|title=American Feminism: Key Source Documents, 1848-1920|last=Beer|first=Janet|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415219457|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was educated at the Norwood Institute.

She married Robert Walker Baker (1863&amp;ndash;1956) around 1893.  The couple had three sons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Suffrage activist ==
Bakers was one of [[Alice Paul]]’s earliest associates. She helped Alice Paul and [[Lucy Burns]] plan their first major event–the March 3, 1913, national suffrage parade on the eve of Woodrow Wilson’s inauguration.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

In 1914 she served as treasurer of the [[Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/static/women-of-protest/articles-and-essays/selected-leaders-of-the-national-womans-party/lobbyists.html |title=Abby Scott Baker (1871-1944) |date= |accessdate=2014-07-23 |quote= |publisher= |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker traveled the country as part of the Congressional Union’s “Suffrage Special” train tour of western states in April–May 1916. Baker was in charge of handling the press for the tour. The support that she helped raise from women in states that had already granted women’s suffrage.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;  On April 29, Baker wrote to ''The Suffragist'' on how the tour was received '[Men] invariably call out, 'Here come the Suffragettes,' but very soon they are saying, 'She's all right,' and 'That's straight lady,' or some such approving phrase..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924030480556/cu31924030480556_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "The story of the Woman's Party"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tour culminated in a June 1916 meeting in Chicago to form what was at first called the Woman’s Party of Western Voters, or Woman’s Party, for short (NWP). When the NWP was more formally organized in relation to the CU in March 1917, Baker was elected to the NWP executive committee and served as its press chairman (1917-18) and political chairman (1917; 1919-21).&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Baker was among the first demonstrators to picket the White House; she was arrested in September 1917 and sentenced to 60 days in the [[Lorton Reformatory|Occoquan Workhouse]]. In February–March 1919, she served as publicity manager and speaker for the “Prison Special,” a three-week lecture tour by NWP activists who spoke to packed audiences about their jail experiences in an effort to generate support for the suffrage cause.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; The other speakers included [[Lillian Ascough]], [[Harriot Stanton Blatch]] and [[Lucy Burns]]. They spoke publicly, distributed literature, and sold the [[The Suffragist|''Suffragist''.]] This tour was credited with arousing interest in federal suffrage among, prospective, voting age women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu/archive/suffragists/SuffragistsSpeak/1916.html|title=Suffragists Timeline: 1916|website=groups.ischool.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the NWP’s patriotism was challenged, she reminded critics that her three sons were fighting in World War I.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Baker maintained an intense travel schedule before and during the campaign season for the [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920 presidential election]], shuttling between the campaign headquarters of [[Warren G. Harding]] in Ohio and [[James M. Cox]] in Tennessee, building close relationships with both candidates. Baker's indefatigable efforts drew a great deal of media attention, and helped to normalize the presence of women in the political sphere in the public imagination.&lt;ref name="milcit" /&gt;

== Later life ==
After suffrage was achieved, Baker became a member of the NWP’s Committee on International Relations and the Women’s Consultative Committee of the League of Nations. She also represented the NWP at the League’s 1935 international conferences in Geneva where the issue of equal rights was discussed.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

She died on May 13, 1944, in [[Washington, DC]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7653">In [[software engineering]] and [[programming language theory]], the '''abstraction principle''' (or the '''principle of abstraction''') is a basic [[dictum]] that aims to reduce duplication of information in a program (usually with emphasis on [[code duplication]]) whenever practical by making use of [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]]s provided by the programming language or [[software libraries]] {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. The principle is sometimes stated as a recommendation to the programmer, but sometimes stated as a requirement of the programming language, assuming it is self-understood why abstractions are desirable to use. The origins of the principle are uncertain; it has been reinvented a number of times, sometimes under a different name, with slight variations.

When read as recommendation to the programmer, the abstraction principle can be generalized as the "[[don't repeat yourself]]" principle, which recommends avoiding the duplication of information in general, and also avoiding the duplication of human effort involved in the software development process.

== The principle ==
As a recommendation to the programmer, in its formulation by [[Benjamin C. Pierce]] in ''[[Types and Programming Languages]]'' (2002), the abstraction principle reads (emphasis in original):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=Benjamin|title=Types and Programming Languages|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=0-262-16209-1|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Each significant piece of functionality in a program should be implemented in just one place in the source code. Where similar functions are carried out by distinct pieces of code, it is generally beneficial to combine them into one by ''abstracting out'' the varying parts.}}

As a requirement of the programming language, in its formulation by David A. Schmidt in ''The structure of typed programming languages'' (1994), the abstraction principle reads:.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Schmidt, ''The structure of typed programming languages'', MIT Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-262-19349-3}}, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|The phrases of any semantically meaningful syntactic class may be named.}}

== History and variations ==
Under this very name, the abstraction principle appears into a long list of books. Here we give a necessarily incomplete list, together with the formulation if it is succinct:

The principle plays a central role in [[Design pattern (computer science)|design patterns]] in [[object-oriented programming]], although most writings on that topic do not give a name to the principle. The [[Design Patterns (book)|influential book by the Gang of Four]], states: "The focus here is ''[[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulating]] the concept that varies'', a theme of many design patterns." This statement has been rephrased by other authors as "Find what varies and encapsulate it."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Shalloway, James Trott, ''Design patterns explained: a new perspective on object-oriented design'', Addison-Wesley, 2002, {{ISBN|0-201-71594-5}}, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- these guys can't even phrase something this simple coherently; no wonder they have herd of cargo-cult programmers following them --&gt;

In this century, the principle has been reinvented in [[extreme programming]] under the slogan "Once and Only Once". The definition of this principle was rather succinct in its first appearance: "no duplicate code".&lt;ref&gt;Kent Beck, ''Extreme programming explained: embrace change'', 2nd edition, Addison-Wesley, 2000, {{ISBN|0-201-61641-6}}, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; It has later been elaborated as applicable to other issues in software development: "Automate every process that's worth automating. If you find yourself performing a task many times, script it."&lt;ref&gt;Chromatic, ''Extreme programming pocket guide'', O'Reilly, 2003, {{ISBN|0-596-00485-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
The abstraction principle is often stated in the context of some mechanism intended to facilitate abstraction. The basic mechanism of control abstraction is a function or [[subroutine]]. Data abstractions include various forms of [[type polymorphism]]. More elaborate mechanisms that may combine data and control abstractions include: [[abstract data type]]s, including [[Class (computer science)|classes]], [[Polymorphism_(computer_science)#Polytypism|polytypism]] etc. The quest for richer abstractions that allow less duplication in complex scenarios is one of the driving forces in programming language research and design.

Inexperienced programmers may be tempted to introduce too much abstraction in their program&amp;mdash;abstraction that won't be used more than once. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}  A complementary principle that emphasize this issue is "[[You Ain't Gonna Need It]]" and, more generally, the [[KISS principle]].

Since code is usually subject to revisions, following the abstraction principle may entail [[refactoring]] of code. The effort of rewriting a piece of code generically needs to be amortized against the estimated future benefits of an abstraction. A rule of thumb governing this was devised by [[Martin Fowler]], and popularized as [[Rule of three (programming)|the rule of three]]. It states that if a piece of code is copied more than twice, i.e. it would end up having three or more copies, then it needs to be abstracted out.

== Generalizations ==
"[[Don't repeat yourself]]", or the "DRY principle", is a generalization developed in the context of [[multi-tier architecture]]s, where related code is by necessity duplicated to some extent across tiers, usually in different languages. In practical terms, the recommendation here is to rely on automated tools, like [[code generator]]s and [[data transformation]]s to avoid repetition.{{Citation Needed|date=November 2018}}

== Hardware programming interfaces ==
In addition to optimizing code, a hierarchical/recursive meaning of Abstraction level in programming also refers to the interfaces between hardware communication layers, also called "abstraction levels" and "abstraction layers." In this case, level of abstraction often is synonymous with interface. For example, in examining shellcode and the interface between higher and lower level languages, the level of abstraction changes from operating system commands (for example, in C) to register and circuit level calls and commands (for example, in assembly and binary). In the case of that example, the boundary or interface between the abstraction levels is the stack.&lt;ref&gt;Koziol, ''The Shellcoders Handbook"'', Wiley, 2004, p. 10, {{ISBN|0-7645-4468-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Agile manufacturing''' is a term applied to an organization that has created the processes, tools, and training to enable it to respond quickly to customer needs and market changes while still controlling costs and quality. 

An [[enabling factor]] in becoming an agile manufacturer has been the development of manufacturing support technology that allows the marketers, the designers and the production personnel to share a common database of parts and products, to share data on production capacities and problems&amp;mdash;particularly where small initial problems may have larger ''[[downstream (manufacturing)|downstream]]'' effects.  It is a general proposition of manufacturing that the cost of correcting quality issues increases as the problem moves downstream, so that it is cheaper to correct quality problems at the earliest possible point in the process.

Agile manufacturing is seen as the next step after [[lean manufacturing]] in the evolution of production methodology.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} The key difference between the two is like between a thin and an athletic person, agile being the latter. One can be neither, one or both. In manufacturing theory, being both is often referred to as leagile.
According to Martin Christopher, when companies have to decide what to be, they have to look at the customer order cycle (COC) (the time the customers are willing to wait) and the leadtime for getting supplies. If the supplier has a short lead time, lean production is possible. If the COC is short, agile production is beneficial.

Agile manufacturing is an approach to manufacturing which is focused on meeting the needs of customers while maintaining high standards of quality and controlling the overall costs involved in the production of a particular product. This approach is geared towards companies working in a highly competitive environment, where small variations in performance and product delivery can make a huge difference in the long term to a company's survival and reputation among consumers.

This concept is closely related to lean manufacturing, in which the goal is to reduce waste as much as possible. In lean manufacturing, the company aims to cut all costs which are not directly related to the production of a product for the consumer. Agile manufacturing can include this concept, but it also adds an additional dimension, the idea that customer demands need to be met rapidly and effectively. In situations where companies integrate both approaches, they are sometimes said to be using "agile and lean manufacturing".
Companies which utilize an agile manufacturing approach tend to have very strong networks with suppliers and related companies, along with numerous cooperative teams which work within the company to deliver products effectively. They can retool facilities quickly, negotiate new agreements with suppliers and other partners in response to changing market forces, and take other steps to meet customer demands. This means that the company can increase production on products with a high consumer demand, as well as redesign products to respond to issues which have emerged on the open market.

Markets can change very quickly, especially in the global economy. A company which cannot adapt quickly to change may find itself left behind, and once a company starts to lose market share, it can fall rapidly. The goal of agile manufacturing is to keep a company ahead of the competition so that consumers think of that company first, which allows it to continue innovating and introducing new products, because it is financially stable and it has a strong customer support base.

Companies that want to switch to the use of agile manufacturing can take advantage of consultants who specialize in helping companies convert and improve existing systems. Consultants can offer advice and assistance which is tailored to the industry a company is involved in, and they usually focus on making companies competitive as quickly as possible with proved agile techniques. There are also a number of textbooks and manuals available with additional information on agile manufacturing techniques and approaches.

[[File:Aluminium dross2.png|Aluminium dross|right|thumb]]

'''Aluminium dross''', a byproduct of the [[aluminium smelting]] process, can be mechanically recycled to separate the residual [[aluminium]] metal from the [[aluminium oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imp.mtu.edu/jmmce/issue5-1/P47-62.pdf |title=Institute of Materials Processing (IMP) &amp;#124; Materials Science &amp; Engineering |publisher=Imp.mtu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azom.com/news.aspx?newsID=30991 |title=Taha Opens Dross Recycling Facility in New Zealand |publisher=Azom.com |date=2011-10-26 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermo-mechanical metal extraction==
The mechanical process of [[recycling]] does not use any toxic chemicals previously used in the process of extracting the valuable aluminium in the dross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waste-management-world.com/index/display/article-display.articles.waste-management-world.recycling.2011.10b.Aluminium_Dross_Recycled_into_Fertilizer_in_New_Zealand.QP129867.dcmp=rss.page=1.html |title=New Aluminium Dross Recycling Facility in New Zealand |publisher=Waste Management World |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2014-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530115618/http://www.waste-management-world.com/index/display/article-display.articles.waste-management-world.recycling.2011.10b.Aluminium_Dross_Recycled_into_Fertilizer_in_New_Zealand.QP129867.dcmp=rss.page=1.html |archive-date=2012-05-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hot dross processing]] system whereby the majority of metal is recovered without chemically reducing the aluminium oxides. The [[dross]] is first crushed then separated into aluminium metal rich particles and aluminium oxide rich particles based on density. The metal rich particles are then melted in a furnace to remove the remaining oxide particles.

==Mechanical extraction vs chemical==
Recycling aluminium dross mechanically is an environmentally sensitive method, and is not toxic. This is completely different from how aluminium metal used to be extracted from dross using an array of hazardous chemicals which resulted in a concentrated highly toxic '[[salt cake]]' residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dross Processing |publisher=Archive.is |date=2006-09-26 |accessdate=2014-06-09 |url=http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/pdf/10.1201/9781420006247.ch13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products that can be made with the residual==
A variety of products can be made from the residual aluminium dross after it is recycled into aluminium oxide. See more information on aluminium oxide.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[[Aluminium oxide]]&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium oxide has a variety of industrial uses which includes being used in [[paint]], [[dye]], [[concrete]], [[explosives]], and [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aluminumsulfate.net/Aluminum-Oxide.html |title=Aluminum Oxide |publisher=Aluminumsulfate.net |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf [[Thermite]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dross recycling is different==
Aluminium dross recycling is a completely different process to strictly [[aluminium recycling]]. Aluminium recycling is where pure aluminium metal products (previously used in another form) are re-melted into aluminium [[ingot]]s and then re-used to new aluminium products.&lt;ref&gt;cf [[Aluminium recycling]]&lt;/ref&gt; While aluminium dross recycling is where the dross, a byproduct of the smelting process in the creation of aluminium from [[bauxite]], can be mechanically recycled thus separating the residual aluminium metal from the aluminium oxide.&lt;ref&gt;http://nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/metals/8D.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astrochicken''' is the name given to a [[thought experiment]] expounded by [[theoretical physicist]] [[Freeman Dyson]]. In his book ''Disturbing the Universe'' (1979), Dyson contemplated how humanity could build a small, [[Self-replication|self-replicating]] automaton that could explore space more efficiently than a manned craft could. He attributed the general idea to [[John von Neumann]], based on a lecture von Neumann gave in 1948 titled ''The General and Logical Theory of Automata''. Dyson expanded on von Neumann's [[Automata theory|automata theories]] and added a biological component to them.

Astrochicken, Dyson explained, would be a one-kilogram [[spacecraft]] unlike any before it. It would be a creation of the intersection of biology, [[artificial intelligence]] and modern microelectronics&amp;mdash;a blend of organic and electronic components. Astrochicken would be launched by a conventional spacecraft into space, like an egg being laid into space. Astrochicken would then hatch and start growing a solar-energy collector. The solar collector would feed an [[ion drive]] engine that would power the craft. Once Astrochicken entered a planet's vicinity, it would collect material from the moons and rings of the planet, taking in nutrients. It could land and take off using an auxiliary chemical rocket similar to that used by [[bombardier beetle]]s. It would periodically transmit details of its journey when it could make radio contact with Earth.

The term "astrochicken" does not occur in Dyson's earliest essays regarding [[Self-replicating_spacecraft#Von_Neumann_probes|von Neumann-inspired automata]]. The concept was announced in a lecture Dyson was giving in [[Adelaide, Australia]] on the subject of space exploration with [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/ccc/cc121802.html|title=Cambridge Conference Correspondence|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An audience member called out "Oh, you mean this is an astro-chicken." and the whimsical name caught on, with Dyson beginning to use it himself in subsequent essays he wrote on his theoretical biotechnology spacecraft.

Today, Dyson's Astrochicken resonates with several theories of how space exploration might proceed in the future. Computer scientist [[Rodney Brooks]] has proposed sending a multitude of cheap, bug-like robots to explore Mars instead of solitary, expensive rovers. Cheaper and smaller means of studying space have also been the primary design philosophy of [[NASA]] for many years, perhaps best exemplified by the [[Mars Pathfinder]] mission. Physicist and noted author [[Michio Kaku]] wrote in his work ''Hyperspace'', "Small, lightweight, and intelligent, Astrochicken is a versatile space probe that has a clear advantage over the bulky, exorbitantly expensive space missions of the past, which have been a bottleneck to space exploration. ... It will not need huge quantities of rocket fuel; it will be bred and programmed to 'eat' ice and hydrocarbons found in the rings surrounding the outer planets".

As a noted author of essays on the possibilities of science in the future, Dyson's theories, such as the [[Dyson sphere]] and the [[Dyson tree]], have become popular in the scientific and [[science fiction]] communities. The more whimsically named "Astrochicken" has not achieved this same level of fame.

'''''Automate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World''''' is a book written by Christopher Steiner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chrissteiner.com/ |title=Christopher Steiner |publisher=Chrissteiner.com |accessdate=2013-05-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214110417/http://www.chrissteiner.com/ |archivedate=2014-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and published by [[Penguin Group]]. Steiner begins his study of algorithms on Wall Street in the 1980s &lt;ref name=Bloomberg2012-09-06&gt;{{cite web|last=Vance |first=Ashlee |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-09-06/book-review-automate-this-by-christopher-steiner#p1 |title=Book Review: 'Automate This,' by Christopher Steiner |work=[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]] |date=2012-09-06 |accessdate=2013-05-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109145459/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-09-06/book-review-automate-this-by-christopher-steiner |archivedate=2014-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also provides examples from other industries.  For example, he explains the history of [[Pandora Radio]] and the use of algorithms in music identification.  He expresses concern that such use of algorithms may lead to the homogenization of music over time.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite web|last=Morozov |first=Evgeny |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443686004577633491013088640 |title=Book Review: Automate This |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=2012-09-20 |accessdate=2013-05-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521095137/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443686004577633491013088640.html |archivedate=2013-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner also discusses the algorithms that eLoyalty (now owned by [[Mattersight Corporation]] following divestiture of the technology) was created by dissecting 2 million speech patterns and can now identify a caller's personality style and direct the caller with a compatible customer support representative.&lt;ref name=Fortune&gt;{{cite web|url=http://features.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/tag/automate-this/ |title=Automate This - FORTUNE Features |publisher=CNN |date=2012-08-24 |accessdate=2013-05-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105010743/http://features.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/tag/automate-this/ |archivedate=2013-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner's book shares both the warning and the opportunity that algorithms bring to just about every industry in the world, and the pros and cons of the societal impact of automation (e.g. impact on employment).&lt;ref name=Bloomberg2012-09-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fortune/&gt;

'''''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting''''' is a 1966 conceptual artwork by the Japanese artist [[Yoko Ono]].

==Work==
The work is made from paper, glass, a metal frame, a metal chain, a magnifying glass, and a painted ladder. The word YES is printed on the piece of paper.&lt;ref name='Bilbao'&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceiling Painting, Yes Painting|url=http://yokoono.guggenheim-bilbao.eus/en/artworks/ceiling-painting-yes-painting.html|publisher=Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is interactive, with the viewer (or participant) expected to climb the ladder and use a magnifying glass to look at the word 'YES' which is printed on paper beneath a sheet of glass suspended from the ceiling.&lt;ref name='Bilbao'/&gt;

The work was shown at Ono's autumn 1966 show, ''Unfinished Paintings and Objects By Yoko Ono'' at the [[Indica Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref name='Bilbao'/&gt; Two different ladders were used by Ono in the New York and subsequent London showing of the piece.&lt;ref name="Buskirk2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martha Buskirk|title=Creative Enterprise: Contemporary Art Between Museum and Marketplace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ELqZ5YQZ1HUC|date=12 April 2012|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4411-8820-5|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was displayed at Ono's 2014 retrospective at the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]].&lt;ref name='Bilbao'/&gt;

The relationship of the participant to the piece has changed in subsequent decades. At a retrospective in 2000, ''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting'' was displayed on a pedestal with physical interaction no longer possible. Interaction with Ono's ''Painting to Hammer a Nail'' was equally limited, with the piece having been displayed behind plexiglass.&lt;ref name="Buskirk2012"/&gt;

The preview night of Ono's INDICA exhibition on 9 November 1966 was visited by the musician [[John Lennon]] who had heard that "this amazing woman was going to be putting on a show...and it was going to be a bit of a happening". Lennon was initially impressed by the humour of Ono's work ''[[Apple (artwork)|Apple]]'', and later said of his interaction with ''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting'' that he had "climbed the ladder, looked through the spyglass, and in tiny little letters it said 'yes'...So it was positive. I felt relieved".&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nell Beram|author2=Carolyn Boriss-Krimsky|title=Yoko Ono: Collector of Skies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pCOWKp3LZ0C|date=1 February 2012|publisher=Abrams|isbn=978-1-61312-513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon's initial interaction with ''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting'' was depicted in the Canadian playwright [[Jean Yoon]]'s 2002 play ''The Yoko Ono Project''.&lt;ref name="YoonOno2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean Yoon|author2=Yōko Ono|title=The Yoko Ono Project|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fGahrFq9-FgC|year=2002|publisher=Broken Jaw Press|isbn=978-1-55391-001-5|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The positive message of the piece attracted Lennon to Ono, the pair were subsequently introduced with neither apparently knowing much about each other's creative work.&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"/&gt; Ono recalled in a 2014 interview with art critic [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] for ''[[The Guardian]]'' that "The ladder John had to climb up was very high" with Jones writing that the "smallness of the yes and the difficulty of reaching it" reflected Ono's pain after the breakup of a recent relationship.&lt;ref name=Guard14&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/13/yoko-ono-guggenheim-bilbao-conceptual-influence|title=Yoko Ono show at Guggenheim shines light on pioneering conceptual artist|date=13 March 2014|author=Jonathan Jones (journalist)|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting'' has been described by Ono as being representative of a journey towards [[hope]] and affirmation from [[pain]]. The difficulty in attaining hope and affirmation has been likened by Ono to the intimidating stature of a cathedral.&lt;ref name='ArtStory'&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceiling Painting, Yes Painting|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-ono-yoko-artworks.htm|publisher=The Art Story|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between ''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting'' and Ono's 1964 work ''Cut Piece'' was extensively critiqued by James M. Harding in his essay "Between Material and Matrix: Yoko Ono's ''Cut Piece'' and the Unmaking of Collage" in his 2012 book of essays, ''Cutting Performances: Collage Events, Feminist Artists, and the American Avant-Garde''.&lt;ref name="Harding2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=James M.

'''Conflict trap''' is a term to describe the pattern when [[civil war]]s repeat themselves.

== Description ==
Scholars have offered a few reasons for it, after [[Paul Collier]] and Nicholas Sambanis (2002) noticed this pattern and coined the term ‘conflict trap’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=COLLIER|first=PAUL|last2=SAMBANIS|first2=NICHOLAS|title=Understanding Civil War|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022002702046001001|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=3–12|doi=10.1177/0022002702046001001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, a civil war can aggravate the causal political and economic conditions which lead to a repeat civil war. Other reasons can be because the [[combatant]]s are fighting over stakes that is valuable to both the parties, combatants are unable to defeat each other or are engaged in a long duration serious war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walter|first=Barbara F.|date=2015-10-01|title=Why Bad Governance Leads to Repeat Civil War|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022002714528006|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|language=en|volume=59|issue=7|pages=1242–1272|doi=10.1177/0022002714528006|issn=0022-0027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and Legal Institutions play an important role in inhibiting a repeat civil war, hence preventing a country from entering a conflict trap. Strong institutions can put a check on the incumbent’s power, hence ensuring [[Welfare|public welfare]] and therefore rebels have fewer reasons to restart a civil war. Also, this removes the need for the rebels to maintain an army or a threat of war. A strong political and legal system also gives a non-violent platform to rebels to bring about desired changes, so they may not need to adopt violent ways to protest.

There can be other reasons why a civil war may start and repeat itself. There may be intense grievances held by the groups, which motivate them to fight. Inferior health conditions, lower [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] and poor [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] create conditions for dissatisfaction, and hence civil wars. If a country is poor, it may be easier for rebels to organize an army and start a civil war. Weaker states serve as one of reasons for an easier rebellion, since they lack capacity to effectively keep rebels in check. A country’s geography may also contribute in wars since rebels can easily escape.

In [[multilinear algebra]] and [[tensor analysis]], '''covariance''' and '''contravariance''' describe how the quantitative description of certain geometric or physical entities changes with a [[change of basis]]. 

In physics, a basis is sometimes thought of as a set of reference axes.  A change of scale on the reference axes corresponds to a change of units in the problem.  For instance, by changing scale from meters to centimeters (that is, ''dividing'' the scale of the reference axes by 100), the components of a measured [[velocity]] [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] are ''multiplied'' by 100.  Vectors exhibit this behavior of changing scale ''inversely'' to changes in scale to the reference axes and consequently are called ''contravariant''.  As a result, vectors often have units of distance or distance with other units (as, for example, velocity has units of distance divided by time).

In contrast, [[covector]]s (also called ''dual vectors'') typically have units of the inverse of distance or the inverse of distance with other units.  An example of a covector is the [[gradient]], which has units of a spatial [[derivative]], or distance&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.  The components of covectors change in the ''same way'' as changes to scale of the reference axes and consequently are called ''covariant''.

A third concept related to covariance and contravariance is [[Invariant (physics)|invariance]].  An example of a physical [[observable]] that does not change with a change of scale on the reference axes is the [[mass]] of a particle, which has units of mass (that is, no units of distance).  The single, [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] value of mass is independent of changes to the scale of the reference axes and consequently is called ''invariant''.

Under more general changes in basis:
* For a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] (such as a [[direction vector]] or velocity vector) to be [[Invariant (mathematics)|basis-independent]], the components of the vector must ''contra-vary'' with a change of basis to compensate. That is, the matrix that transforms the vector components must be the inverse of the matrix that transforms the basis vectors. The components of vectors (as opposed to those of covectors) are said to be '''contravariant'''.  Examples of vectors with ''contravariant components'' include the position of an object relative to an observer, or any derivative of position with respect to time, including velocity, [[acceleration]], and [[jerk (physics)|jerk]]. In [[Einstein notation]], contravariant components are denoted with ''upper indices'' as in
*:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = v^i \mathbf{e}_i .&lt;/math&gt;
* For a covector to be basis-independent, its components must ''co-vary'' with a change of basis to remain representing the same covector. That is, the components must be transformed by the same matrix as the change of basis matrix. The components of covectors (as opposed to those of vectors) are said to be '''covariant'''. Examples of ''covariant'' vectors generally appear when taking a [[gradient]] of a function. In [[Einstein notation]], covariant components are denoted with ''lower indices'' as in
*:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = v_i \mathbf{e}^i .&lt;/math&gt;

Curvilinear coordinate systems, such as cylindrical or spherical coordinates, are often used in physical and geometric problems.  Associated with any coordinate system is a natural choice of coordinate basis for vectors based at each point of the space, and covariance and contravariance are particularly important for understanding how the coordinate description of a vector changes by passing from one coordinate system to another.

The terms ''covariant'' and ''contravariant'' were introduced by [[James Joseph Sylvester]] in 1851&lt;ref&gt;Sylvester, James Joseph. "On the general theory of associated algebraical forms." ''Cambridge and Dublin Math. Journal, VI'' (1851): 289-293.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/758983870|title=The collected mathematical papers of James Joseph Sylvester. Volume 3, 1870-1883|last=1814-1897.|first=Sylvester, James Joseph,|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1107661439|location=Cambridge|oclc=758983870}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of associated algebraic forms theory.  In the lexicon of [[category theory]], [[covariance and contravariance of functors|covariance and contravariance]] are properties of [[functor]]s; unfortunately, it is the lower-index objects (covectors) that generically have [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]]s, which are contravariant, while the upper-index objects (vectors) instead have [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]]s, which are covariant.  This terminological conflict may be avoided by calling contravariant functors "cofunctors"—in accord with the "covector" terminology, and continuing the tradition of treating vectors as the concept and covectors as the coconcept.

[[Tensor]]s are objects in [[multilinear algebra]] that can have aspects of both covariance ''and'' contravariance.

==Introduction==
In physics, a vector typically arises as the outcome of a measurement or series of measurements, and is represented as a list (or [[tuple]]) of numbers such as

:&lt;math&gt;(v_1,v_2,v_3) .&lt;/math&gt;

The numbers in the list depend on the choice of [[coordinate system]].  For instance, if the vector represents position with respect to an observer ([[position vector]]), then the coordinate system may be obtained from a system of rigid rods, or reference axes, along which the components ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are measured.  For a vector to represent a geometric object, it must be possible to describe how it looks in any other coordinate system.  That is to say, the components of the vectors will ''transform'' in a certain way in passing from one coordinate system to another.

A ''contravariant vector'' has components that "transform as the coordinates do" under changes of coordinates (and so inversely to the transformation of the reference axes), including [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] and dilation. [[Active and passive transformation#Passive transformation|The vector itself does not change under these operations]]; instead, the components of the vector change in a way that cancels the change in the spatial axes, in the same way that coordinates change.  In other words, if the reference axes were rotated in one direction, the component representation of the vector would rotate in exactly the opposite way. Similarly, if the reference axes were stretched in one direction, the components of the vector, like the coordinates, would reduce in an exactly compensating way.  Mathematically, if the coordinate system undergoes a transformation described by an [[invertible matrix]] ''M'', so that a [[coordinate vector]] '''x''' is transformed to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}'=M\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;, then a contravariant vector '''v''' must be similarly transformed via &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}'=M\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;. This important requirement is what distinguishes a contravariant vector from any other triple of physically meaningful quantities.  For example, if ''v'' consists of the ''x''-, ''y''-, and ''z''-components of [[velocity]], then ''v'' is a contravariant vector: if the coordinates of space are stretched, rotated, or twisted, then the components of the velocity transform in the same way.  Examples of contravariant vectors include [[displacement (vector)|displacement]], [[velocity]] and [[acceleration]].  On the other hand, for instance, a triple consisting of the length, width, and height of a rectangular box could make up the three components of an abstract [[vector space|vector]], but this vector would not be contravariant, since a change in coordinates on the space does not change the box's length, width, and height: instead these are [[scalar (physics)|scalars]].

By contrast, a ''covariant vector'' has components that change oppositely to the coordinates or, equivalently, transform like the reference axes.  For instance, the components of the [[gradient]] vector of a function
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^1}\widehat{x}^1+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^2}\widehat{x}^2+\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^3}\widehat{x}^3&lt;/math&gt;
transform like the reference axes themselves.

==Definition==
The general formulation of covariance and contravariance refer to how the components of a coordinate vector transform under a [[change of basis]] ([[Active and passive transformation|passive transformation]]).  Thus let ''V'' be a [[vector space]] of dimension ''n'' over the field of [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] ''S'', and let each of {{nowrap|1='''f''' = (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{nowrap|1='''f'''′ = (''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] of ''V''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A basis '''f''' may here profitably be viewed as a [[linear isomorphism]] from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''V''.  Regarding '''f''' as a row vector whose entries are the elements of the basis, the associated linear isomorphism is then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\mapsto \mathbf{f}\mathbf{x}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, let the [[change of basis]] from '''f''' to '''f'''′ be given by

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}\mapsto \mathbf{f}' = \left(\sum_i a^i_1X_i,\dots,\sum_i a^i_nX_i\right) = \mathbf{f}A&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

for some [[invertible matrix|invertible]] ''n''×''n'' matrix ''A'' with entries &lt;math&gt;a^i_j&lt;/math&gt;.
Here, each vector ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; of the '''f'''′ basis is a linear combination of the vectors ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of the '''f''' basis, so that

:&lt;math&gt;Y_j=\sum_i a^i_jX_i.&lt;/math&gt;

===Contravariant transformation===
A vector &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in ''V'' is expressed uniquely as a [[linear combination]] of the elements of the '''f''' basis as

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;v=\sum_i v^i[\mathbf{f}]X_i,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

where ''v''{{i sup|''i''}}['''f'''] are [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] in ''S'' known as the '''components''' of ''v'' in the '''f''' basis. Denote the [[column vector]] of components of ''v'' by '''v'''['''f''']:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f}] = \begin{bmatrix}v^1[\mathbf{f}]\\v^2[\mathbf{f}]\\\vdots\\v^n[\mathbf{f}]\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so that ({{EquationNote|2}}) can be rewritten as a matrix product

:&lt;math&gt;v = \mathbf{f}\, \mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;

The vector ''v'' may also be expressed in terms of the '''f'''′ basis, so that

:&lt;math&gt;v = \mathbf{f'}\, \mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f'}].&lt;/math&gt;

However, since the vector ''v'' itself is invariant under the choice of basis,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}\, \mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f}] = v = \mathbf{f'}\, \mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f'}].&lt;/math&gt;

The invariance of ''v'' combined with the relationship ({{EquationNote|1}}) between '''f''' and '''f'''′ implies that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}\, \mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f}] = \mathbf{f}A\, \mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f}A],&lt;/math&gt;

giving the transformation rule

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f}A] = A^{-1}\mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of components,

:&lt;math&gt;v^i[\mathbf{f}A] = \sum_j \tilde{a}^i_jv^j[\mathbf{f}]&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients &lt;math&gt;\tilde{a}^i_j&lt;/math&gt; are the entries of the [[inverse matrix]] of ''A''.

Because the components of the vector ''v'' transform with the ''inverse'' of the matrix ''A'', these components are said to '''transform contravariantly''' under a change of basis.

The way ''A'' relates the two  pairs is depicted in the following informal diagram using an arrow.  The reversal of the arrow indicates a contravariant change:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
     \mathbf{f} &amp;\longrightarrow \mathbf{f'} \\
  v[\mathbf{f}] &amp;\longleftarrow v[\mathbf{f'}]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Covariant transformation===
{{main|Covariant transformation}}
A [[linear functional]] ''α'' on ''V'' is expressed uniquely in terms of its '''components''' (scalars in ''S'') in the '''f''' basis as

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(X_i) = \alpha_i[\mathbf{f}] , \quad i=1,2,\dots,n.&lt;/math&gt;

These components are the action of ''α'' on the basis vectors ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of the '''f''' basis.

Under the change of basis from '''f''' to '''f'''′ ({{EquationNote|1}}), the components transform so that

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \alpha_i[\mathbf{f}A] &amp;= \alpha(Y_i) \\
                        &amp;= \alpha\left(\sum_j a^j_i X_j\right) \\
                        &amp;= \sum_j a^j_i \alpha(X_j) \\
                        &amp;= \sum_j a^j_i \alpha_j[\mathbf{f}].
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

Denote the [[row vector]] of components of ''α'' by ''α''['''f''']:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\alpha}[\mathbf{f}] = \begin{bmatrix}\alpha_1[\mathbf{f}],\alpha_2[\mathbf{f}],\dots,\alpha_n[\mathbf{f}]\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so that ({{EquationNote|3}}) can be rewritten as the matrix product

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha[\mathbf{f}A] = \alpha[\mathbf{f}]A.&lt;/math&gt;

Because the components of the linear functional α transform with the matrix ''A'', these components are said to '''transform covariantly''' under a change of basis.

The way ''A'' relates the two  pairs is depicted in the following informal diagram using an arrow.  A covariant relationship is indicated since the arrows travel in the same direction:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
          \mathbf{f} &amp;\longrightarrow \mathbf{f'} \\
  \alpha[\mathbf{f}] &amp;\longrightarrow \alpha[\mathbf{f'}]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Had a column vector representation been used instead, the transformation law would be the [[matrix transpose|transpose]]
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^\mathrm{T}[\mathbf{f}A] = A^\mathrm{T}\alpha^\mathrm{T}[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;

==Coordinates==
The choice of basis '''f''' on the vector space ''V'' defines uniquely a set of coordinate functions on ''V'', by means of
:&lt;math&gt;x^i[\mathbf{f}](v) = v^i[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;
The coordinates on ''V'' are therefore contravariant in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;x^i[\mathbf{f}A] = \sum_{k=1}^n \tilde{a}^i_kx^k[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;
Conversely, a system of ''n'' quantities ''v''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; that transform like the coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; on ''V'' defines a contravariant vector.  A system of ''n'' quantities that transform oppositely to the coordinates is then a covariant vector.

This formulation of contravariance and covariance is often more natural in applications in which there is a coordinate space (a [[manifold]]) on which vectors live as [[tangent vector]]s or [[cotangent vector]]s.  Given a local coordinate system ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; on the manifold, the reference axes for the coordinate system are the [[vector field]]s
:&lt;math&gt;X_1 = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^1},\dots,X_n=\frac{\partial}{\partial x^n}.&lt;/math&gt;
This gives rise to the frame {{nowrap|1='''f''' = (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} at every point of the coordinate patch.

If ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; is a different coordinate system and
:&lt;math&gt;Y_1=\frac{\partial}{\partial y^1},\dots,Y_n = \frac{\partial}{\partial y^n},&lt;/math&gt;
then the frame '''f'''' is related to the frame '''f''' by the inverse of the [[Jacobian matrix]] of the coordinate transition:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}' = \mathbf{f}J^{-1},\quad J = \left(\frac{\partial y^i}{\partial x^j}\right)_{i,j=1}^n.&lt;/math&gt;
Or, in indices,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial y^i} = \sum_{j=1}^n\frac{\partial x^j}{\partial y^i}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}.&lt;/math&gt;

A tangent vector is by definition a vector that is a linear combination of the coordinate partials &lt;math&gt;\partial/\partial x^i&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus a tangent vector is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;v = \sum_{i=1}^n v^i[\mathbf{f}] X_i = \mathbf{f}\ \mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;

Such a vector is contravariant with respect to change of frame.  Under changes in the coordinate system, one has
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}\left[\mathbf{f}'\right] = \mathbf{v}\left[\mathbf{f}J^{-1}\right] = J\, \mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the components of a tangent vector transform via
:&lt;math&gt;v^i\left[\mathbf{f}'\right] = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\partial y^i}{\partial x^j}v^j[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;

Accordingly, a system of ''n'' quantities ''v''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; depending on the coordinates that transform in this way on passing from one coordinate system to another is called a contravariant vector.

==Covariant and contravariant components of a vector with a metric==
In a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] ''V'' over a field ''K'' with a symmetric [[bilinear form]] {{nowrap|''g'' : ''V'' × ''V'' → ''K''}} (which may be referred to as the [[metric tensor]]), there is little distinction between covariant and contravariant vectors, because the [[bilinear form]] allows covectors to be identified with vectors.  That is, a vector ''v'' uniquely determines a covector ''α'' via
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(w) = g(v, w) &lt;/math&gt;
for all vectors ''w''.  Conversely, each covector ''α'' determines a unique vector ''v'' by this equation.  Because of this identification of vectors with covectors, one may speak of the '''covariant components''' or '''contravariant components''' of a vector, that is, they are just representations of the same vector using the [[Dual basis|reciprocal basis]].

Given a basis {{nowrap|1='''f''' = (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of ''V'', there is a unique reciprocal basis {{nowrap|1='''f'''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt; = (''Y''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} of ''V'' determined by requiring that
:&lt;math&gt;Y^i(X_j) = \delta^i_j,&lt;/math&gt;
the [[Kronecker delta]].  In terms of these bases, any vector ''v'' can be written in two ways:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
v &amp;= \sum_i v^i[\mathbf{f}]X_i = \mathbf{f}\,\mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f}]\\
&amp;=\sum_i v_i[\mathbf{f}]Y^i = \mathbf{f}^\sharp\mathbf{v}^\sharp[\mathbf{f}].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The components ''v''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;['''f'''] are the '''contravariant components''' of the vector ''v'' in the basis '''f''', and the components ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;['''f'''] are the '''covariant components''' of ''v'' in the basis '''f'''.  The terminology is justified because under a change of basis,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f}A] = A^{-1}\mathbf{v}[\mathbf{f}],\quad \mathbf{v}^\sharp[\mathbf{f}A] = A^T\mathbf{v}^\sharp[\mathbf{f}].&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Basis.svg|frame|350px|left|The {{color box|darkred}} contravariant components of a vector are obtained by [[scalar projection|projecting]] onto the {{color box|orange}} coordinate axes. The covariant components are obtained by projecting onto the normal lines to the {{color box|blue}} coordinate hyperplanes.]]
{{clear}}

===Euclidean plane===
In the Euclidean plane, the [[dot product]] allows for vectors to be identified with covectors.  If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2&lt;/math&gt; is a basis, then the dual basis &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}^1,\mathbf{e}^2&lt;/math&gt; satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \mathbf{e}^1\cdot\mathbf{e}_1 = 1, &amp;\quad \mathbf{e}^1\cdot\mathbf{e}_2 = 0 \\
  \mathbf{e}^2\cdot\mathbf{e}_1 = 0, &amp;\quad \mathbf{e}^2\cdot\mathbf{e}_2 = 1.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are perpendicular to each other, as are '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the lengths of '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; normalized against '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

====Example====
For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bowen |first=Ray |title=Introduction to Vectors and Tensors |year=2008 |publisher=Dover |pages=78, 79, 81 |url=http://repositories.tamu.edu/bitstream/handle/1969.1/2502/IntroductionToVectorsAndTensorsVol1.pdf?sequence=12 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; suppose that we are given a basis '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consisting of a pair of vectors making a 45° angle with one another, such that '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has length 2 and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has length 1.  Then the dual basis vectors are given as follows:
* '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the result of rotating '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through an angle of 90° (where the sense is measured by assuming the pair '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be positively oriented), and then rescaling so that {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ⋅ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1}} holds.
* '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the result of rotating '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through an angle of 90°, and then rescaling so that {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ⋅ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 1}} holds.
Applying these rules, we find
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}^1 = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{e}_1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\mathbf{e}_2&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}^2 = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\mathbf{e}_1 + 2\mathbf{e}_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the change of basis matrix in going from the original basis to the reciprocal basis is
:&lt;math&gt;R = \begin{bmatrix}
   \frac{1}{2}         &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
  -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}  &amp;  2
\end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;
since
:&lt;math&gt;[\mathbf{e}^1\ \mathbf{e}^2] = [\mathbf{e}_1\ \mathbf{e}_2]\begin{bmatrix}
   \frac{1}{2}        &amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
  -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp;  2
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, the vector
:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{3}{2}\mathbf{e}_1 + 2\mathbf{e}_2&lt;/math&gt;
is a vector with contravariant components
:&lt;math&gt;v^1 = \frac{3}{2},\quad v^2 = 2.&lt;/math&gt;

The covariant components are obtained by equating the two expressions for the vector ''v'':
:&lt;math&gt;v = v_1\mathbf{e}^1 + v_2\mathbf{e}^2 = v^1\mathbf{e}_1 + v^2\mathbf{e}_2&lt;/math&gt;
so
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \begin{bmatrix}v_1\\ v_2\end{bmatrix} &amp;= R^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}v^1 \\ v^2\end{bmatrix} \\
                                        &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}4 &amp; \sqrt{2} \\ \sqrt{2} &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}
                                             \begin{bmatrix}v^1 \\ v^2\end{bmatrix} \\
                                        &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}6 + 2\sqrt{2} \\ 2 + \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Three-dimensional Euclidean space===

In the three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], one can also determine explicitly the dual basis to a given set of [[basis vector]]s '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that are not necessarily assumed to be orthogonal nor of unit norm. The dual basis vectors are:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}^1 = \frac{\mathbf{e}_2 \times \mathbf{e}_3}{\mathbf{e}_1 \cdot (\mathbf{e}_2 \times \mathbf{e}_3)} ; \qquad \mathbf{e}^2 = \frac{\mathbf{e}_3 \times \mathbf{e}_1}{\mathbf{e}_2 \cdot (\mathbf{e}_3 \times \mathbf{e}_1)}; \qquad \mathbf{e}^3 = \frac{\mathbf{e}_1 \times \mathbf{e}_2}{\mathbf{e}_3 \cdot (\mathbf{e}_1 \times \mathbf{e}_2)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Even when the '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; are not [[Orthonormality|orthonormal]], they are still mutually reciprocal:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}^i \cdot \mathbf{e}_j = \delta^i_j,&lt;/math&gt;

Then the contravariant components of any vector '''v''' can be obtained by the [[dot product]] of '''v''' with the dual basis vectors:

:&lt;math&gt; q^1 = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{e}^1; \qquad q^2 = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{e}^2; \qquad q^3 = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{e}^3 .&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, the covariant components of '''v''' can be obtained from the dot product of '''v''' with basis vectors, viz.

:&lt;math&gt; q_1 = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{e}_1; \qquad q_2 = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{e}_2; \qquad q_3 = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{e}_3 .&lt;/math&gt;

Then '''v''' can be expressed in two (reciprocal) ways, viz.
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = q^i \mathbf{e}_i = q^1 \mathbf{e}_1 + q^2 \mathbf{e}_2 + q^3 \mathbf{e}_3 .&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = q_i \mathbf{e}^i = q_1 \mathbf{e}^1 + q_2 \mathbf{e}^2 + q_3 \mathbf{e}^3 &lt;/math&gt;
Combining the above relations, we have
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{e}^i) \mathbf{e}_i = (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{e}_i) \mathbf{e}^i &lt;/math&gt;
and we can convert between the basis and dual basis with
:&lt;math&gt;q_i = \mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{e}_i = (q^j \mathbf{e}_j)\cdot \mathbf{e}_i = (\mathbf{e}_j\cdot\mathbf{e}_i) q^j &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;q^i = \mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{e}^i = (q_j \mathbf{e}^j)\cdot \mathbf{e}^i = (\mathbf{e}^j\cdot\mathbf{e}^i) q_j .&lt;/math&gt;

If the basis vectors are [[orthonormal]], then they are the same as the dual basis vectors. So there is no need to distinguish between contravariant components and covariant components which are also equal.

===General Euclidean spaces===
More generally, in an ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space ''V'', if a basis is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_1,\dots,\mathbf{e}_n,&lt;/math&gt;
the reciprocal basis is given by (double indices are summed over),
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}^i=g^{ij}\mathbf{e}_j&lt;/math&gt;
where the coefficients ''g''&lt;sup&gt;''ij''&lt;/sup&gt; are the entries of the inverse matrix of
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij} = \mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j .&lt;/math&gt;
Indeed, we then have
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}^i\cdot\mathbf{e}_k=g^{ij}\mathbf{e}_j\cdot\mathbf{e}_k=g^{ij}g_{jk} = \delta^i_k .&lt;/math&gt;

The covariant and contravariant components of any vector

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = q_i \mathbf{e}^i = q^i \mathbf{e}_i \, &lt;/math&gt;

are related as above by
:&lt;math&gt;q_i = \mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{e}_i = (q^j \mathbf{e}_j)\cdot \mathbf{e}_i = q^jg_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;q^i = \mathbf{v}\cdot \mathbf{e}^i = (q_j\mathbf{e}^j)\cdot \mathbf{e}^i = q_jg^{ji} .&lt;/math&gt;

==Informal usage==
In the field of [[physics]], the [[adjective]] '''covariant''' is often used informally as a synonym for invariant. For example, the [[Schrödinger equation]] does not keep its written form under the coordinate transformations of [[special relativity]]. Thus, a physicist might say that the Schrödinger equation is ''not covariant''. In contrast, the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] and the [[Dirac equation]] do keep their written form under these coordinate transformations. Thus, a physicist might say that these equations are ''covariant''.

Despite this usage of "covariant", it is more accurate to say that the Klein–Gordon and Dirac equations are invariant, and that the Schrödinger equation is not invariant. Additionally, to remove ambiguity, the transformation by which the invariance is evaluated should be indicated.

Because the components of vectors are contravariant and those of covectors are covariant, the vectors themselves are often referred to as being contravariant and the covectors as covariant.

==Use in tensor analysis==

The distinction between covariance and contravariance is particularly important for computations with [[tensor]]s, which often have '''mixed variance'''. This means that they have both covariant and contravariant components, or both vector and covector components. The valence of a tensor is the number of variant and covariant terms, and in [[Einstein notation]], covariant components have lower indices, while contravariant components have upper indices.  The duality between covariance and contravariance intervenes whenever a vector or tensor quantity is represented by its components, although modern [[differential geometry]] uses more sophisticated [[Tensor (intrinsic definition)|index-free methods to represent tensors]].

In [[tensor analysis]], a '''covariant''' vector varies more or less reciprocally to a corresponding contravariant vector.  Expressions for lengths, areas and volumes of objects in the vector space can then be given in terms of tensors with covariant and contravariant indices. Under simple expansions and contractions of the coordinates, the reciprocity is exact; under affine transformations the components of a vector intermingle on going between covariant and contravariant expression.

On a [[manifold]], a [[tensor field]] will typically have multiple, upper and lower indices, where Einstein notation is widely used. When the manifold is equipped with a [[metric tensor|metric]], covariant and contravariant indices become very closely related to one another. Contravariant indices can be turned into covariant indices by [[contraction of a tensor|contracting]] with the metric tensor. The reverse is possible by contracting with the (matrix) inverse of the metric tensor. Note that in general, no such relation exists in spaces not endowed with a metric tensor. Furthermore, from a more abstract standpoint, a tensor is simply "there" and its components of either kind are only calculational artifacts whose values depend on the chosen coordinates.

The explanation in geometric terms is that a general tensor will have contravariant indices as well as covariant indices, because it has parts that live in the [[tangent bundle]] as well as the [[cotangent bundle]].

A contravariant vector is one which transforms like &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x^{\mu} \!&lt;/math&gt; are the coordinates of a particle at its [[proper time]] &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. A covariant vector is one which transforms like &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x^{\mu}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar field.

==Algebra and geometry==

In [[category theory]], there are [[covariant functor]]s and [[contravariant functor]]s. The assignment of the [[dual space]] to a vector space is a standard example of a contravariant functor. Some constructions of [[multilinear algebra]] are of 'mixed' variance, which prevents them from being functors.

In [[differential geometry]], the components of a vector relative to a basis of the [[tangent bundle]] are covariant if they change with the same linear transformation as a change of basis.  They are contravariant if they change by the inverse transformation.  This is sometimes a source of confusion for two distinct but related reasons.  The first is that vectors whose components are covariant (called covectors or [[1-form]]s) actually [[pullback (differential geometry)|pull back]] under smooth functions, meaning that the operation assigning the space of covectors to a smooth manifold is actually a ''contravariant'' functor.  Likewise, vectors whose components are contravariant [[pushforward (differential)|push forward]] under smooth mappings, so the operation assigning the space of (contravariant) vectors to a smooth manifold is a ''covariant'' functor.  Secondly, in the classical approach to differential geometry, it is not bases of the tangent bundle that are the most primitive object, but rather changes in the coordinate system.  Vectors with contravariant components transform in the same way as changes in the coordinates (because these actually change oppositely to the induced change of basis).  Likewise, vectors with covariant components transform in the opposite way as changes in the coordinates.

[[File:Antonio de Pereda - El sueño del caballero - Google Art Project.jpg|300px|right|thumb|''The Knight's Dream'', 1655, by [[Antonio de Pereda]]]]

A '''dream''' is a succession of [[image]]s, [[idea]]s, [[emotions]], and [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]s that usually occur involuntarily in the [[mind]] during certain stages of [[sleep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dream |title=Dream |publisher= The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. 2000 |accessdate=May 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content and purpose of dreams are not fully understood, although they have been a topic of scientific, philosophical and religious interest throughout [[recorded history]]. [[Dream interpretation]] is the attempt at drawing meaning from dreams and searching for an underlying message. The scientific study of dreams is called [[oneirology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kavanau |first=J.L. |title=Sleep, memory maintenance, and mental disorders |journal=Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |year=2000 |volume=12|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreams mainly occur in the [[REM sleep|rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of sleep]]—when [[brain activity]] is high and resembles that of being awake. REM sleep is revealed by continuous movements of the eyes during sleep. At times, dreams may occur during other [[stages of sleep]]. However, these dreams tend to be much less vivid or memorable.&lt;ref name=Hobson/&gt; The length of a dream can vary; they may last for a few seconds, or approximately 20–30 minutes.&lt;ref name=Hobson/&gt; People are more likely to remember the dream if they are awakened during the REM phase.

Opinions about the meaning of dreams have varied and shifted through time and culture. Many endorse the [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] theory of dreams – that dreams reveal insight into hidden desires and emotions. Other prominent theories include those suggesting that dreams assist in memory formation, problem solving, or simply are a product of random brain activation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = When dreaming is believing: The (motivated) interpretation of dreams.|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 249–264|volume = 96|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/a0013264|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge|first2 = Michael I.|last2 = Norton|pmid=19159131|year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Sigmund Freud]], who developed the [[psychology|psychological]] discipline of [[psychoanalysis]], wrote extensively about dream theories and their interpretations in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1900). The interpretation of dreams. London: Hogarth Press&lt;/ref&gt; He explained dreams as manifestations of one's deepest desires and anxieties, often relating to [[Repressed memory|repressed]] [[Childhood amnesia|childhood memories]] or obsessions.

In modern times, dreams have been seen as a connection to the [[unconscious mind]]. They range from normal and ordinary to overly [[Surrealism|surreal]] and bizarre. Dreams can have varying natures, such as being [[fear|frightening]], exciting, [[magical (paranormal)|magical]], [[Depression (mood)|melancholic]], adventurous, or [[Nocturnal emission|sexual]]. The events in dreams are generally outside the control of the dreamer, with the exception of [[lucid dream]]ing, where the dreamer is [[self-aware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lite|first1=Jordan|title=How Can You Control Your Dreams?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-control-dreams/|website=Scientific America|date=July 29, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202070145/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-control-dreams/|archivedate=February 2, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreams can at times make a [[creativity|creative]] thought occur to the person or give a sense of [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]].&lt;ref&gt;Domhoff, W.

==Cultural meaning==
{{Main|Dream interpretation}}

===Ancient history===
[[Dreaming (spirituality)|The Dreaming]] is a common term within the [[animist]] creation narrative of [[indigenous Australians]] for a personal, or group, [[Creation myth|creation]] and for what may be understood as the "timeless time" of formative creation and perpetual creating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://environment.gov.au/parks/uluru/culture-history/culture/index.html Uluru – Kata Tjuta National Park: Tjukurpa – Anangu culture] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711104046/http://environment.gov.au/parks/uluru/culture-history/culture/index.html |date=July 11, 2009 }} environment.gov.au, June 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Egypt]], as far back as 2000 BC, the Egyptians wrote down their dreams on [[papyrus]]. People with vivid and significant dreams were thought blessed and were considered special.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, J.S. (1935). ''The dream in primitive cultures'' London: Cressett.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Egyptians believed that dreams were like [[oracles]], bringing messages from the gods. They thought that the best way to receive divine revelation was through dreaming and thus they would induce (or "incubate") dreams. Egyptians would go to sanctuaries and sleep on special "dream beds" in hope of receiving advice, comfort, or healing from the gods.&lt;ref&gt;1991. languages of dreaming : Anthropological approaches to the study of dreaming In other cultures.

===Classical history===
[[File:Hupao.jpg|thumb|[[Dreaming of the Tiger Spring]] (虎跑夢泉)]]

In Chinese history, people wrote of two vital aspects of the soul of which one is freed from the body during slumber to journey in a dream realm, while the other remained in the body,&lt;ref name=bulkeley-71/&gt; although this belief and dream interpretation had been questioned since early times, such as by the philosopher [[Wang Chong]] (27–97 AD).&lt;ref name=bulkeley-71&gt;{{cite book|last=Bulkeley|first=Kelly|title=Dreaming in the world's religions: A comparative history|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8147-9956-7|pages=71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian text ''[[Upanishads]]'', written between 900 and 500 BC, emphasize two meanings of dreams. The first says that dreams are merely expressions of inner desires. The second is the belief of the soul leaving the body and being guided until awakened.

The Greeks shared their beliefs with the Egyptians on how to interpret good and bad dreams, and the idea of incubating dreams. [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]], the Greek god of dreams, also sent warnings and prophecies to those who slept at shrines and temples. The earliest Greek beliefs about dreams were that their gods physically visited the dreamers, where they entered through a keyhole, exiting the same way after the divine message was given.

[[Antiphon (orator)|Antiphon]] wrote the first known Greek book on dreams in the 5th century BC. In that century, other cultures influenced Greeks to develop the belief that souls left the sleeping body.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neil, C.W. (1976). ''Dreams, culture and the individual''. San Francisco: Chandler &amp; Sharp.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hippocrates]] (469–399 BC) had a simple dream theory: during the day, the soul receives images; during the night, it produces images. Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) believed dreams caused [[physiological]] activity. He thought dreams could analyze illness and predict diseases. [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]], for his part, believed that all dreams are produced by thoughts and conversations a dreamer had during the preceding days.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, De Republica, VI, 10&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero's ''[[Somnium Scipionis]]'' described a lengthy dream vision, which in turn was commented on by [[Macrobius]] in his ''Commentarii in Somnium Scipionis''.

[[Herodotus]] in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', writes "The visions that occur to us in dreams are, more often than not, the things we have been concerned about during the day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herodotus|title=The Histories|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Welsh history, [[The Dream of Rhonabwy]] ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: Breuddwyd Rhonabwy) is a [[Middle Welsh]] prose tale. Set during the reign of [[Madog ap Maredudd]], prince of [[Powys]] (died 1160), it is dated to the late 12th or 13th century. It survives in only one manuscript, [[the Red Book of Hergest]], and has been associated with the Mabinogion since its publication by [[Lady Charlotte Guest]] in the 19th century. The bulk of the narrative describes a dream vision experienced by its central character, '''Rhonabwy''', a retainer of Madog, in which he visits the time of King Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mabinogion.info/rhonabwy.htm |title=Rhonabwy |accessdate=2016-07-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130193204/http://mabinogion.info/rhonabwy.htm |archivedate=2016-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in Welsh history, the tale 'The Dream of Macsen Wledig' is a romanticised story about the Roman emperor [[Magnus Maximus]], called Macsen Wledig in Welsh. Born in [[Hispania]], he became a legionary commander in Britain, assembled a Celtic army and assumed the title of Emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 383. He was defeated in battle in 385 and beheaded at the direction of the [[Eastern Roman emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/society/myths_mabinogion_macsen_wledig.shtml |title=BBC Wales - History - Themes - the Dream of Macsen Wledig |accessdate=2017-09-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720083249/http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/society/myths_mabinogion_macsen_wledig.shtml |archivedate=2017-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious views ===
==== In Abrahamic religions====
[[File:Michael Lukas Leopold Willmann 001.jpg|thumb|Jacob's dream of a [[Jacob's Ladder|ladder of angels]], c. 1690, by [[Michael Willmann]]]]
In Judaism, dreams are considered part of the experience of the world that can be interpreted and from which lessons can be garnered. It is discussed in the Talmud, Tractate Berachot 55–60.

The ancient [[Hebrews]] connected their dreams heavily with their religion, though the Hebrews were [[monotheistic]] and believed that dreams were the voice of one God alone. Hebrews also differentiated between good dreams (from God) and bad dreams (from evil spirits). The Hebrews, like many other ancient cultures, incubated dreams in order to receive divine revelation. For example, the Hebrew prophet Samuel would "lie down and sleep in the temple at Shiloh before the Ark and receive the word of the Lord." Most of the dreams in the [[Bible]] are in the [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |id=zs3gup4iFu4C |page=15 |plainurl=yes }} |title=A letter that has not been read: Dreams in the Hebrew Bible |first=Shaul |last=Bar |publisher=Hebrew Union College Press |year=2001 |accessdate=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christians]] mostly shared the beliefs of the Hebrews and thought that dreams were of a supernatural character because the [[Old Testament]] includes frequent stories of dreams with divine inspiration. The most famous of these dream stories was [[Jacob's ladder|Jacob's dream of a ladder]] that stretches from [[Earth]] to [[Heaven]]. Many [[Christians]] preach that God can speak to people through their dreams.

[[Iain R. Edgar]] has researched the role of dreams in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edgar|first=Iain|title=The Dream in Islam: From Qur'anic Tradition to Jihadist Inspiration|year=2011|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-85745-235-1|page=178|url=http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title.php?rowtag=EdgarDream|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929125708/http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title.php?rowtag=EdgarDream|archivedate=2011-09-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has argued that dreams play an important role in the history of Islam and the lives of Muslims, since dream interpretation is the only way that Muslims can receive revelations from God since the death of the last prophet, [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgar|first=Iain R.|author2=Henig, David|title=Istikhara: The Guidance and practice of Islamic dream incubation through ethnographic comparison|journal=History and Anthropology|date=September 2010|volume=21|issue=3|pages=251–262|doi=10.1080/02757206.2010.496781|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/10630.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108072540/https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/10630.pdf|archivedate=2017-11-08|df=|citeseerx=10.1.1.1012.7334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In Hinduism ====
In the [[Mandukya Upanishad]], part of the [[Veda]] scriptures of [[Hinduism|Indian Hinduism]], a dream is one of three states that the soul experiences during its lifetime, the other two states being the waking state and the sleep state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/mand/mand_4.html |title=The Mandukya Upanishad, Section 4 |last=Krishnananda |first=Swami |date=16 November 1996 |access-date=26 March 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409004128/http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/mand/mand_4.html |archivedate=9 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In Buddhism ====
In Buddhism, ideas about dreams are similar to the classical and folk traditions in South Asia. The same dream is sometimes experienced by multiple people, as in the case of the [[bodhisattva#Theravada Buddhism|Buddha-to-be]] leaving his home. It is described in the ''[[Mahavastu|Mahāvastu]]'' that several of the Buddha's relatives had premonition-like dreams preceding this. Some dreams are also seen to transcend time: the Buddha-to-be has certain dreams that are the same as those of [[List of the named Buddhas|previous Buddhas]], the ''[[Lalitavistara]]'' states. In Buddhist literature, dreams often function as a "signpost" motif to mark certain stages in the life of the main character.&lt;ref name="Young 2003"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Young|first=S.|year=2003|title=Dreams|via=Indian Folklife|volume=13|url=http://indianfolklore.org/journals/index.php/IFL/article/download/434/497|encyclopedia=The encyclopedia of South Asian Folklore|page=7|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225064910/http://indianfolklore.org/journals/index.php/IFL/article/download/434/497|archivedate=2018-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist views about dreams are expressed in the [[atthakatha|Pāli Commentaries]] and the [[Milinda Panha|Milinda Pañhā]].&lt;ref name="Young 2003" /&gt;

===Dreams and philosophical realism===
{{Main|Dream argument}}
[[File:Briullov, Karl - A Dream of a Girl Before a Sunrise.jpg|thumb|''A Dream of a Girl Before a Sunrise'' by [[Karl Bryullov]] (1830–1833)]]
Some philosophers have concluded that what we think of as the "real world" could be or is an illusion (an idea known as the [[skeptical hypothesis]] about [[ontology]]).

The first recorded mention of the idea was by [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]], and it is also discussed in [[Hinduism]], which makes extensive use of the argument in its writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Buddhism As Presented by the Brahmanical Systems |last=Kher |first=Chitrarekha V. |year=1992 |publisher=Sri Satguru Publications |isbn=978-81-7030-293-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formally introduced to Western philosophy by [[Descartes]] in the 17th century in his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''. Stimulus, usually an auditory one, becomes a part of a dream, eventually then awakening the dreamer.

===Postclassical and medieval history===
Some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]] tribes and [[Mexico|Mexican]] civilizations believe that dreams are a way of visiting and having contact with their [[ancestors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tedlock | first1 = B | year = 1981 | title = Quiche Maya dream Interpretation | url = | journal = Ethos | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 313–350 | doi=10.1525/eth.1981.9.4.02a00050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes used [[vision quest]]s as a rite of passage, fasting and praying until an anticipated guiding dream was received, to be shared with the rest of the tribe upon their return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dreams.ca/dreams.htm |last=Webb |first=Craig |year=1995 |title=Dreams: Practical Meaning &amp; Applications |publisher=The DREAMS Foundation |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305002601/http://www.dreams.ca/dreams.htm |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/native-american-dream-beliefs/ |accessdate=April 10, 2012 |title=Native American Dream Beliefs |publisher=Dream Encyclopedia |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415132211/http://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/native-american-dream-beliefs/ |archivedate=April 15, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middle Ages]] brought a harsh interpretation of dreams.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} They were seen as [[evil]], and the images as [[temptation]]s from the [[devil]]. Many believed that during sleep, the devil could fill the human mind with corrupting and harmful thoughts. [[Martin Luther]], founder of [[Protestantism]], believed dreams were the work of the Devil. However, [[Catholics]] such as [[St. Augustine]] and [[St. Jerome]] claimed that the direction of their lives was heavily influenced by their dreams.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===In art===
The depiction of dreams in Renaissance and [[Baroque]] art is often related to Biblical narrative. Examples are ''Joachim's Dream'' (1304–1306) from the [[Scrovegni Chapel]] fresco cycle by [[Giotto]], and ''[[Jacob's Dream]]'' (1639) by [[Jusepe de Ribera]]. Dreams and dark imaginings are the theme of several notable works of the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]], such as [[Goya]]'s etching ''[[The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters]]'' (c. 1799) and [[Henry Fuseli]]'s painting ''[[The Nightmare]]'' (1781). [[Salvador Dalí]]'s ''[[Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening]]'' (1944) also investigates this theme through absurd juxtapositions of a nude lady, tigers leaping out of a pomegranate, and a spider-like elephant walking in the background. [[Henri Rousseau]]'s last painting was ''[[The Dream (Rousseau painting)|The Dream]]''. ''[[Le Rêve (Picasso)|Le Rêve]]'' ("The Dream") is a 1932 painting by [[Pablo Picasso]].

===In literature===
{{further|Dream world (plot device)}}

Dream frames were frequently used in medieval allegory to justify the narrative; ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/chaucer/BD.html|title=The book of the duchess|publisher=Washington State University|accessdate=May 24, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114035012/http://public.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/chaucer/BD.html|archivedate=November 14, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Vision Concerning [[Piers Plowman]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/langland.html|title=William Langland's The Vision Concerning Piers Plowman|publisher=The History Guide|accessdate=May 24, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606164224/http://www.historyguide.org/ancient/langland.html|archivedate=June 6, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two such [[dream vision]]s. Even before them, in antiquity, the same device had been used by [[Cicero]] and [[Lucian of Samosata]].

[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 24.png|thumb|The Cheshire Cat vanishes in Wonderland]]

They have also featured in [[fantasy]] and [[speculative fiction]] since the 19th century. One of the best-known dream worlds is [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]] from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', as well as [[Looking-Glass Land]] from its sequel, ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. Unlike many dream worlds, Carroll's logic is like that of actual dreams, with transitions and flexible causality.

Other fictional dream worlds include the [[Dreamlands]] of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[Dream Cycle]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillips Lovecraft|first=Howard|title=The Dream Cycle of H.P.

Dreamworlds, shared hallucinations and other alternate realities feature in a number of works by [[Philip K. Dick]], such as ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'' and ''[[Ubik]]''. Similar themes were explored by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], for instance in ''[[The Circular Ruins]]''.

===In popular culture===
[[File:Gospel of Matthew Chapter 2-9 (Bible Illustrations by Sweet Media).jpg|thumb|right|200px|An artist's illustration of [[Saint Joseph]] dreaming.]]
[[File:Self-portrait of a Dreamer.jpg|thumb|Self-portrait of a Dreamer]]
Modern [[popular culture]] often conceives of dreams, like Freud, as expressions of the dreamer's deepest fears and desires.&lt;ref name="Van Riper 56"&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Riper |first=A. Bowdoin |title=Science in popular culture: a reference guide |publisher=[[Greenwood Press]] |location=Westport |year=2002 |page=56 |isbn=978-0-313-31822-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film version of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939) depicts a full-color dream that causes Dorothy to perceive her black-and-white reality and those with whom she shares it in a new way. In films such as ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' (1989), and ''[[Inception]]'' (2010), the protagonists must extract vital clues from surreal dreams.&lt;ref name="Van Riper 57"&gt;Van Riper, op. cit., p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most dreams in popular culture are, however, not symbolic, but straightforward and realistic depictions of their dreamer's fears and desires.&lt;ref name="Van Riper 57"/&gt; Dream scenes may be indistinguishable from those set in the dreamer's real world, a narrative device that undermines the dreamer's and the audience's sense of security&lt;ref name="Van Riper 57"/&gt; and allows [[horror film]] protagonists, such as those of ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' (1976), ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' (1980) or ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' (1981) to be suddenly attacked by dark forces while resting in seemingly safe places.&lt;ref name="Van Riper 57"/&gt;

In [[speculative fiction]], the line between dreams and reality may be blurred even more in the service of the story.&lt;ref name="Van Riper 57"/&gt; Dreams may be psychically invaded or manipulated (''[[Dreamscape (1984 film)|Dreamscape]]'', 1984; the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' films, 1984–2010; ''[[Inception]]'', 2010) or even come literally true (as in ''[[The Lathe of Heaven]]'', 1971). In Ursula K. Le Guin's book, ''[[The Lathe of Heaven]]'' (1971), the protagonist finds that his "effective" dreams can retroactively change reality. [[Peter Weir]]'s 1977 Australian film ''The Last Wave'' makes a simple and straightforward postulate about the premonitory nature of dreams (from one of his Aboriginal characters) that "...&amp;nbsp;dreams are the shadow of something real". In [[Kyell Gold]]'s novel ''Green Fairy'' from the [[Forester Universe#Dangerous Spirits|Dangerous Spirits]] series, the protagonist, Sol, experiences the memories of a dancer who died 100 years before through Absinthe induced dreams and after each dream something from it materializes into his reality. Such stories play to audiences' experiences with their own dreams, which feel as real to them.&lt;ref name="Van Riper 57"/&gt;

==Dynamic psychiatry==
===Freud's view===
In the late 19th century, psychotherapist [[Sigmund Freud]] developed a theory that the content of dreams is driven by unconscious [[wish fulfillment]]. Freud called dreams the "[[royal road]] to the unconscious."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1949)., p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; He theorized that the content of dreams reflects the dreamer's unconscious mind and specifically that dream content is shaped by unconscious wish fulfillment. He argued that important unconscious desires often relate to early childhood memories and experiences. Freud's theory describes dreams as having both [[:wikt:manifest|manifest]] and [[wikt:latent|latent]] content. Latent content relates to deep unconscious wishes or fantasies while manifest content is superficial and meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Latent dream-content (pp. 31ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=PbauAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Theory of Dreams |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PbauAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2014 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=xFtqAAAAMAAJ 1969] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |isbn=978-1-31767048-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manifest content often masks or obscures latent content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Manifest content (pp. 54ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=gZixAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT44 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Theory of Dreams |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gZixAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2014 |origyear=1969 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon-on-Thames |isbn=978-1-31767047-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early work, Freud argued that the vast majority of latent dream content is sexual in nature, but he later moved away from this categorical position. In ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'' he considered how trauma or aggression could influence dream content. He also discussed supernatural origins in ''Dreams and Occultism'', a lecture published in ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis''.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (pp. 38–70).&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in life Freud acknowledged that "It is impossible to classify as wish fulfillments" the repetitive nightmares associated with post-traumatic stress disorder. Modern experimental studies weigh against many of Freud's theories regarding dreams. Freud's "dream-work" interpretation strategies have not been found to have empirical validity. His theory that dreams were the "guardians" of sleep, repressing and disguising bodily urges to ensure sleep continues, seems unlikely given studies of individuals who can sleep without dreaming. His assertions that repressed memory in infants re-surface decades later in adult dreams conflicts with modern research on memory. Freud's theory has difficulty explaining why young children have static and bland dreams, or why the emotions in most dreams are negative. On the plus side, modern researchers agree with Freud that dreams do have coherence, and that dream content connects to other psychological variables and often connect to recent waking thoughts (though not as often as Freud supposed).&lt;ref&gt;Domhoff, G. W. (2000). Moving Dream Theory Beyond Freud and Jung. Paper presented to the symposium "Beyond Freud and Jung?", Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, CA, 9/23/2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lack of scientific evidence, dream interpretation services based on Freudian or other systems remain popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Folly of Dream Interpretation|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dream-catcher/201307/the-folly-dream-interpretation|accessdate=14 January 2018|work=Psychology Today|date=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jung's view===
[[Carl Jung]] rejected many of Freud's theories. Jung expanded on Freud's idea that dream content relates to the dreamer's unconscious desires. He described dreams as [[messages]] to the dreamer and argued that dreamers should pay attention for their own good. He came to believe that dreams present the dreamer with revelations that can uncover and help to resolve [[emotional]] or religious problems and fears.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, 1964, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung wrote that [[recurring dream]]s show up repeatedly to demand attention, suggesting that the dreamer is neglecting an issue related to the dream. He called this "compensation."  The dream balances the conscious belief and attitudes with an alternative.  Jung did not believe that the conscious attitude was wrong and that the dream provided the true belief.  He argued that good work with dreams takes both into account and comes up with a balanced viewpoint. He believed that many of the symbols or images from these dreams return with each dream. Jung believed that memories formed throughout the day also play a role in dreaming. These memories leave impressions for the unconscious to deal with when the ego is at rest. The unconscious mind re-enacts these glimpses of the past in the form of a dream. Jung called this a ''day residue''.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Jung also argued that dreaming is not a purely individual concern, that all dreams are part of "one great web of psychological factors."

===Fritz Perls' view===

[[Fritz Perls]] presented his theory of dreams as part of the holistic nature of [[Gestalt therapy]]. Dreams are seen as projections of parts of the self that have been ignored, rejected, or [[thought suppression|suppressed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D.M. | last2 = Wenzlaff | first2 = R.M. | last3 = Kozak | first3 = M. | year = 2004 | title = The Return of Suppressed Thoughts in Dreams | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 232–236 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00657.x | pmid=15043639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jung argued that one could consider every person in the dream to represent an aspect of the dreamer, which he called the subjective approach to dreams. [[Fritz Perls|Perls]] expanded this point of view to say that even inanimate objects in the dream may represent aspects of the dreamer. The dreamer may, therefore, be asked to imagine being an object in the dream and to describe it, in order to bring into awareness the characteristics of the object that correspond with the dreamer's personality.

[[File:Sleep EEG REM.png|thumb|left|[[Electroencephalography|EEG]] showing [[brainwaves]] during REM sleep]]

Accumulated observation has shown that dreams are strongly associated with REM [[rapid eye movement sleep]], during which an [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) shows brain activity that, among sleep states, is most like wakefulness. Participant-remembered dreams during [[NREM sleep]] are normally more mundane in comparison.&lt;ref name=Dement1957&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dement | first1 = W. | last2 = Kleitman | first2 = N. | year = 1957 | title = The Relation of Eye Movements during Sleep to Dream Activity | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = 5| pages = 339–346 | doi = 10.1037/h0048189 | pmid=13428941| citeseerx = 10.1.1.308.6874 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During a typical lifespan, a person spends a total of about six years dreaming&lt;ref name="HSWDream"&gt;{{cite book |year=2006 |title=How Dream Works |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/dream3.htm |accessdate=May 4, 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418032147/http://science.howstuffworks.com/dream3.htm |archivedate=April 18, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which is about two hours each night).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2006 |title=Brain Basics: Understanding Sleep |url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brain_basics/understanding_sleep.htm |accessdate=December 16, 2007 |publisher=[[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011011207/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brain_basics/understanding_sleep.htm |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most dreams only last 5 to 20 minutes.&lt;ref name="HSWDream"/&gt; It is unknown where in the brain dreams originate, if there is a single origin for dreams or if multiple portions of the brain are involved, or what the purpose of dreaming is for the body or mind.

During most dreams, the person dreaming is not aware that they are dreaming, no matter how absurd or eccentric the dream is. The reason for this may be that the [[prefrontal cortex]], the region of the brain responsible for logic and planning, exhibits decreased activity during dreams. This allows the dreamer to more actively interact with the dream without thinking about what might happen, since things that would normally stand out in reality blend in with the dream scenery.&lt;ref&gt;Trimble, M. R. (1989). ''The Prefrontal Cortex: Anatomy, Physiology and Neuropsychology of the Frontal Lobe''. ''British Journal of Psychiatry''&lt;/ref&gt;

When REM sleep episodes were timed for their duration and subjects were awakened to make reports before major editing or forgetting of their dreams could take place, subjects accurately reported the length of time they had been dreaming in an REM sleep state. Some researchers have speculated that "[[time dilation]]" effects only seem to be taking place upon reflection and do not truly occur within dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Bolz. "[http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/time-passes-dreams/ How Time Passes in Dreams] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131123724/http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/time-passes-dreams/ |date=2016-01-31 }}" in ''A Moment of Science''. Indiana Public Media. September 2, 2009. Accessed August 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This close correlation of REM sleep and dream experience was the basis of the first series of reports describing the nature of dreaming: that it is a regular nightly rather than occasional phenomenon, and is correlated with high-frequency activity within each sleep period occurring at predictable intervals of approximately every 60–90 minutes in all humans throughout the lifespan.

REM sleep episodes and the dreams that accompany them lengthen progressively through the night, with the first episode being shortest, of approximately 10–12 minutes duration, and the second and third episodes increasing to 15–20 minutes. Dreams at the end of the night may last as long as 15 minutes, although these may be experienced as several distinct episodes due to momentary arousals interrupting sleep as the night ends. Dream reports can be reported from normal subjects 50% of the time when they are awakened prior to the end of the first REM period. This rate of retrieval is increased to about 99% when awakenings are made from the last REM period of the night. The increase in the ability to recall dreams appears related to intensification across the night in the vividness of dream imagery, colors, and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takeuchi|first=Tomoka|title=Dream mechanisms: Is REM sleep indispensable for dreaming?|journal=Sleep &amp; Biological Rhythms|date=June 2005|volume=3|issue=2|pages=56–63|doi=10.1111/j.1479-8425.2005.00165.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--this entire paragraph needs references; someone with a copy of Dement's book might be able to help--&gt;

==In other animal species==
REM sleep and the ability to dream seem to be embedded in the biology of many animals in addition to humans. Scientific research suggests that all mammals experience REM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lesku | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Meyer | first2 = L. C.

Studies have observed signs of dreaming in all mammals studied, including monkeys, dogs, cats, rats, elephants, and shrews. There have also been signs of dreaming in birds and reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dream|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/171188/dream|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=October 26, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111055406/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/171188/dream|archivedate=November 11, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sleeping and dreaming are intertwined. Scientific research results regarding the function of dreaming in animals remain disputable; however, the function of sleeping in living organisms is increasingly clear. For example,  sleep deprivation experiments conducted on rats and other animals have resulted in the deterioration of physiological functioning and actual tissue damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sleep|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/548545/sleep|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=October 26, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111055359/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/548545/sleep|archivedate=November 11, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists argue that humans dream for the same reason other [[amniotes]] do. From a Darwinian perspective dreams would have to fulfill some kind of biological requirement, provide some benefit for natural selection to take place, or at least have no negative impact on fitness. In 2000 Antti Revonsuo, a professor at the University of Turku in Finland, claimed that centuries ago dreams would prepare humans for recognizing and avoiding danger by presenting a simulation of threatening events. The theory has therefore been called the threat-simulation theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Daniel|title=While you were sleeping|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1606872,00.html|publisher=Time magazine|accessdate=October 26, 2011|date=April 5, 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026193118/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1606872,00.html|archivedate=October 26, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tsoukalas (2012) dreaming is related to the reactive patterns elicited by encounters with predators, a fact that is still evident in the control mechanisms of REM sleep (see below).&lt;ref name=Tsoukalas2012&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tsoukalas | first1 = I | year = 2012 | title = The origin of REM sleep: A hypothesis | url = | journal = Dreaming | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 253–283 | doi=10.1037/a0030790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vitelli2013&gt;Vitelli, R.

==Neurological theories==
===Activation synthesis theory===
{{Main|Activation-synthesis hypothesis}}

In 1976 [[J. Allan Hobson]] and [[Robert McCarley]] proposed a new theory that changed dream research, challenging the previously held [[Freudian]] view of dreams as unconscious wishes to be interpreted. They assume that the same structures that induce REM sleep also generate sensory information. Hobson's 1976 research suggested that the signals interpreted as dreams originate in the brainstem during REM sleep. According to Hobson and other researchers, circuits in the brainstem are activated during REM sleep. Once these circuits are activated, areas of the limbic system involved in emotions, sensations, and memories, including the amygdala and hippocampus, become active. The brain synthesizes and interprets these activities; for example, changes in the physical environment such as temperature and humidity, or physical stimuli such as ejaculation, and attempts to create meaning from these signals, result in dreaming.

However, research by [[Mark Solms]] suggests that dreams are generated in the [[forebrain]], and that REM sleep and dreaming are not directly related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Solms |first=M. |year=2000 |title=Dreaming and REM sleep are controlled by different brain mechanisms |publisher= Behavioral and Brain Sciences |edition=23(6) |pages=793–1121}}&lt;/ref&gt; While working in the neurosurgery department at hospitals in [[Johannesburg]] and [[London]], Solms had access to patients with various brain injuries. He began to question patients about their dreams and confirmed that patients with damage to the [[parietal lobe]] stopped dreaming; this finding was in line with Hobson's 1977 theory. However, Solms did not encounter cases of loss of dreaming with patients having brainstem damage. This observation forced him to question Hobson's prevailing theory, which marked the brainstem as the source of the signals interpreted as dreams.

===Continual-activation theory===
Combining Hobson's activation synthesis hypothesis with Solms' findings, the continual-activation theory of dreaming presented by Jie Zhang proposes that dreaming is a result of brain activation and synthesis; at the same time, dreaming and REM sleep are controlled by different brain mechanisms. Zhang hypothesizes that the function of sleep is to process, encode, and transfer the data from the temporary memory store to the [[long-term memory]] store. During [[NREM]] sleep the conscious-related memory (declarative memory) is processed, and during REM sleep the unconscious related memory (procedural memory) is processed.&lt;ref name="Zhang 2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zhang |first=Jie |year=2005 |title=Continual-activation theory of dreaming, Dynamical Psychology |url=http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2005/ZhangDreams.htm |accessdate=March 13, 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427051723/http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2005/ZhangDreams.htm |archivedate=April 27, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhang assumes that during REM sleep the unconscious part of a brain is busy processing the procedural memory; meanwhile, the level of activation in the conscious part of the brain descends to a very low level as the inputs from the sensory systems are basically disconnected. This triggers the "continual-activation" mechanism to generate a data stream from the memory stores to flow through the conscious part of the brain. Zhang suggests that this pulse-like brain activation is the inducer of each dream. He proposes that, with the involvement of the brain associative thinking system, dreaming is, thereafter, self-maintained with the dreamer's own thinking until the next pulse of memory insertion. This explains why dreams have both characteristics of continuity (within a dream) and sudden changes (between two dreams).&lt;ref name="Zhang 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zhang |first=Jie |year=2004 |title=Memory process and the function of sleep |publisher=Journal of Theoretics |edition=6–6 |url=http://www.journaloftheoretics.com/Articles/6-6/Zhang.pdf |accessdate=March 13, 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060320065919/http://www.journaloftheoretics.com/Articles/6-6/Zhang.pdf |archivedate=March 20, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed explanation of how a dream is synthesized is given in a later paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zhang |first=Jie |year=2016 |title=Towards a comprehensive model of human memory, DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.1.2103.9606 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304604880 |accessdate=July 1, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807000307/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304604880_Towards_a_comprehensive_model_of_human_memory |archivedate=August 7, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defensive immobilization: the precursor===
According to Tsoukalas (2012) REM sleep is an evolutionary transformation of a well-known defensive mechanism, the [[tonic immobility]] reflex. This reflex, also known as animal hypnosis or death feigning, functions as the last line of defense against an attacking predator and consists of the total immobilization of the animal: the animal appears dead (cf. "playing possum"). Tsoukalas claims that the neurophysiology and phenomenology of this reaction shows striking similarities to REM sleep, a fact that suggests a deep evolutionary kinship. For example, both reactions exhibit brainstem control, paralysis, hippocampal theta and thermoregulatory changes. Tsoukalas claims that this theory integrates many earlier findings into a unified framework.&lt;ref name=Tsoukalas2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vitelli2013/&gt;

===As excitations of long-term memory===
Eugen Tarnow suggests that dreams are ever-present excitations of [[long-term memory]], even during waking life. The strangeness of dreams is due to the format of long-term memory, reminiscent of [[Wilder Penfield|Penfield]] &amp; Rasmussen's findings that electrical excitations of the [[cerebral cortex|cortex]] give rise to experiences similar to dreams. During waking life an executive function interprets long-term memory consistent with reality checking. Tarnow's theory is a reworking of Freud's theory of dreams in which Freud's unconscious is replaced with the long-term memory system and Freud's "Dream Work" describes the structure of long-term memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tarnow |first=Eugen |year=2003 |title=How Dreams And Memory May Be Related |publisher=NEURO-PSYCHOANALYSIS |edition=5(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in strengthening semantic memories===
[[File:Hippocampus.png|thumb|Location of the [[hippocampus|hippocampi]]]]

A 2001 study showed evidence that illogical locations, characters, and dream flow may help the brain strengthen the linking and consolidation of [[semantic memory|semantic memories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/the-health-benefits-of-dreams |title=The Health Benefits of Dreams |publisher=Webmd.com |date=February 25, 2009 |accessdate=August 11, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806041259/http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/the-health-benefits-of-dreams |archivedate=August 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions may occur because, during REM sleep, the flow of information between the [[hippocampus]] and [[neocortex]] is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=R. Stickgold, J.A. Hobson, R. Fosse, M. Fosse1 |date=November 2001 |title= Sleep, Learning, and Dreams: Off-line Memory Reprocessing |journal=Science |pmid=11691983 |volume=294 |issue=5544 |pages=1052–1057 |doi=10.1126/science.1063530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing levels of the [[stress (medicine)|stress]] hormone [[cortisol]] late in sleep (often during REM sleep) causes this decreased communication. One stage of [[memory consolidation]] is the linking of distant but related memories. Payne and Nadal hypothesize these memories are then consolidated into a smooth narrative, similar to a process that happens when memories are created under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1101/lm.77104 |author=Jessica D.

Robert (1886),&lt;ref&gt;Robert, W. Der Traum als Naturnothwendigkeit erklärt. Zweite Auflage, Hamburg: Seippel, 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; a physician from Hamburg, was the first who suggested that dreams are a need and that they have the function to erase (a) sensory impressions that were not fully worked up, and (b) ideas that were not fully developed during the day. By the dream work, incomplete material is either removed (suppressed) or deepened and included into memory. Robert's ideas were cited repeatedly by Freud in his ''Die Traumdeutung''. [[Hughlings Jackson]] (1911) viewed that sleep serves to sweep away unnecessary memories and connections from the day.

This was revised in 1983 by Crick and Mitchison's "[[reverse learning]]" theory, which states that dreams are like the cleaning-up operations of computers when they are off-line, removing (suppressing) parasitic nodes and other "junk" from the mind during sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans | first1 = C. | last2 = Newman | first2 = E. | year = 1964 | title = Dreaming: An analogy from computers | url = | journal = New Scientist | volume = 419 | issue = | pages = 577–579 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/304111a0 | last1 = Crick | first1 = F. | last2 = Mitchison | first2 = G. | year = 1983 | title = The function of dream sleep | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 304 | issue = 5922| pages = 111–114 | pmid = 6866101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the opposite view that dreaming has an information handling, memory-consolidating function (Hennevin and Leconte, 1971) is also common.

==Psychological theories==
===Role in testing and selecting mental schemas===
Coutts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2466/pr0.102.2.561-574 | last1 = Coutts | first1 = R | year = 2008 | title = Dreams as modifiers and tests of mental schemas: an emotional selection hypothesis | url = | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 102 | issue = 2| pages = 561–574 | pmid = 18567225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; describes dreams as playing a central role in a two-phase sleep process that improves the mind's ability to meet human needs during wakefulness. During the accommodation phase, mental schemas self-modify by incorporating dream themes. During the [[emotional selection]] phase, dreams test prior schema accommodations. Those that appear adaptive are retained, while those that appear maladaptive are culled. The cycle maps to the sleep cycle, repeating several times during a typical night's sleep. [[Alfred Adler]] suggested that dreams are often emotional preparations for solving problems, intoxicating an individual away from common sense toward private logic. The residual dream feelings may either reinforce or inhibit contemplated action.

===Evolutionary psychology theories ===
Numerous theories state that dreaming is a random by-product of REM sleep physiology and that it does not serve any natural purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Revonsuo |first=A. |title=The reinterpretation of dreams: an evolutionary hypothesis of the function of dreaming |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |year=2000 |volume=23 |issue=6 |pmid=11515147 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00004015 |pages=877–901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flanagan claims that "dreams are evolutionary [[Epiphenomenon|epiphenomena]]" and they have no adaptive function. "Dreaming came along as a free ride on a system designed to think and to sleep."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackmore|first=Susan|title=Consciousness an introduction|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-515343-9|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobson, for different reasons, also considers dreams epiphenomena. He believes that the substance of dreams have no significant influence on waking actions, and most people go about their daily lives perfectly well without remembering their dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackmore|first=Susan|title=Consciousness an introduction|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-515343-9|pages=342–343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, however, Hobson published a book, ''Thirteen Dreams that Freud Never Had'',&lt;ref&gt;Hobson, J. A. (2005). ''Thirteen Dreams that Freud Never Had''. New York: Pi Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he analyzed his own dreams after having a stroke in 2001.  The book is filled with the most forthright analyses of Hobson’s dreams, with attention to problems in bodily function and social relations.  The book illustrates how dreams show our most compelling concerns and how they can be used to make sense of the most difficult life situations.  

Hobson proposed the activation-synthesis theory, which states that "there is a randomness of dream imagery and the randomness synthesizes dream-generated images to fit the patterns of internally generated stimulations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tubo |first=J |title=The evolution of dreaming |url=http://webpub.allegheny.edu/employee/r/rmumme/FS101/ResearchPapers/JackieTubo.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928083933/http://webpub.allegheny.edu/employee/r/rmumme/FS101/ResearchPapers/JackieTubo.html |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is based on the physiology of REM sleep, and Hobson believes dreams are the outcome of the forebrain reacting to random activity beginning at the brainstem. The activation-synthesis theory hypothesizes that the peculiar nature of dreams is attributed to certain parts of the brain trying to piece together a story out of what is essentially bizarre information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=M|author2=Zyphur, M|title=The role of dreams in the evolution of the human mind|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|year=2005|volume=3|pages=59–78|url=http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep035978.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811005842/http://www.epjournal.net/filestore/ep035978.pdf|archivedate=2011-08-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, evolutionary psychologists believe dreams serve some adaptive function for survival. [[Deirdre Barrett]] describes dreaming as simply "thinking in different biochemical state" and believes people continue to work on all the same problems—personal and objective—in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url={{Google books|id=ojvXAAAAMAAJ|plainurl=yes}}|last=Barrett|first=Deirdre|chapter=An Evolutionary Theory of Dreams and Problem-Solving |editor-last=Barrett|editor-first=D.

Finnish psychologist Antti Revonsuo posits that dreams have evolved for "threat simulation" exclusively. According to the Threat Simulation Theory he proposes, during much of human evolution physical and interpersonal threats were serious, giving reproductive advantage to those who survived them. Therefore, dreaming evolved to replicate these threats and continually practice dealing with them. In support of this theory, Revonsuo shows that contemporary dreams comprise much more threatening events than people meet in daily non-dream life, and the dreamer usually engages appropriately with them.&lt;ref name="Blackmore 2004 342–343"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackmore|first=Susan|title=Consciousness an Introduction|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-515343-9|pages=342–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested by this theory that dreams serve the purpose of allowing for the rehearsal of threatening scenarios in order to better prepare an individual for real-life threats.

According to Tsoukalas (2012) the biology of dreaming is related to the reactive patterns elicited by predatorial encounters (especially the tonic immobility reflex), a fact that lends support to evolutionary theories claiming that dreams specialize in threat avoidance or emotional processing.&lt;ref name="Tsoukalas2012"/&gt;

===Other hypotheses===
There are many other hypotheses about the function of dreams, including:&lt;ref name="cartwrightcontent"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1993 |title=Functions of Dreams |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreaming |last=Cartwright |first=Rosalind D}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dreams allow the repressed parts of the mind to be satisfied through [[fantasy]] while keeping the conscious mind from thoughts that would suddenly cause one to awaken from shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Vedfelt |first=Ole |title=The Dimensions of Dreams |publisher=Fromm |year=1999 |isbn= 978-0-88064-230-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace (Eds.), Individual Differences in Conscious Experience (pp. 269–307). Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that dreams may function, in part, to recombine unconscious elements within consciousness on a temporary basis by a process they term "mental recombination", in analogy with genetic recombination of DNA. From a bio-computational viewpoint, mental recombination may contribute to maintaining an optimal information processing flexibility in brain information networks.

==Content==
[[File:Romance of History illustration WH Powis.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An artist's rendering of a dream.]]
From the 1940s to 1985, [[Calvin S. Hall]] collected more than 50,000 dream reports at [[Western Reserve University]]. In 1966 Hall and Van De Castle published ''The Content Analysis of Dreams'', in which they outlined a coding system to study 1,000 dream reports from college students.&lt;ref name="hallcontent"&gt;Hall, C., &amp; Van de Castle, R. (1966). The Content Analysis of Dreams. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. [http://psych.ucsc.edu/dreams/Info/content_analysis.html Content Analysis Explained] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412100915/http://psych.ucsc.edu/dreams/Info/content_analysis.html |date=2007-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results indicated that participants from varying parts of the world demonstrated similarity in their dream content. Hall's complete dream reports were made publicly available in the mid-1990s by Hall's protégé [[William Domhoff]].

===Visuals===
The visual nature of dreams is generally highly phantasmagoric; that is, different locations and objects continuously blend into each other. The visuals (including locations, characters/people, objects/artifacts) are generally reflective of a person's memories and experiences, but conversation can take on highly exaggerated and bizarre forms. Some dreams may even tell elaborate stories wherein the dreamer enters entirely new, complex worlds and awakes with ideas, thoughts and feelings never experienced prior to the dream.

People who are blind from birth do not have visual dreams. Their dream contents are related to other senses like [[Hearing (sense)|auditory]], [[Somatosensory system|touch]], [[Olfaction|smell]] and [[taste]], whichever are present since birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How do blind people dream? – The Body Odd |url=http://bodyodd.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/03/09/10602730-how-do-blind-people-dream?lite |date=March 2012 |accessdate=May 10, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130512094729/http://bodyodd.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/03/09/10602730-how-do-blind-people-dream?lite |archivedate=May 12, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotions===
In the Hall study, the most common emotion experienced in dreams was [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]]. Other emotions included [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment]], [[anger]], [[fear]], [[joy]], and [[happiness]]. Negative emotions were much more common than positive ones.&lt;ref name="hallcontent"/&gt;

===Sexual themes===
The Hall data analysis shows that sexual dreams occur no more than 10% of the time and are more prevalent in young to mid-teens.&lt;ref name="hallcontent"/&gt; Another study showed that 8% of both men and women's dreams have sexual content.&lt;ref&gt;Zadra, A., [http://www.journalsleep.org/PDF/AbstractBook2007.pdf "1093: Sex dreams: what to men and women dream about?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222607/http://www.journalsleep.org/PDF/AbstractBook2007.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}, ''Sleep'' Volume 30, Abstract Supplement, 2007 A376.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, sexual dreams may result in [[orgasm]]s or [[nocturnal emission]]s. These are colloquially known as ''wet dreams''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.measuredhs.com/pubs/pdf/FR157/04Chapter04.pdf |title=Badan Pusat Statistik "Indonesia Young Adult Reproductive Health Survey 2002–2004" p. 27 |format=PDF |accessdate=April 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209171035/http://measuredhs.com/pubs/pdf/FR157/04Chapter04.pdf |archivedate=December 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color vs. black and white===
A small minority of people say that they dream only in black and white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Michael Schredl |author2=Petra Ciric |author3=Simon Götz |author4=Lutz Wittmann |date=November 2004 |title=Typical Dreams: Stability and Gender Differences |journal=The Journal of Psychology |volume=138 |issue=6 |doi=10.3200/JRLP.138.6.485-494 |pmid=15612605 |pages=485–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2015}} A 2008 study by a researcher at the [[University of Dundee]] found that people who were only exposed to black and white television and film in childhood reported dreaming in black and white about 25% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3353504/Black-and-white-TV-generation-have-monochrome-dreams.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012010849/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3353504/Black-and-white-TV-generation-have-monochrome-dreams.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 12, 2009|title=Black and white TV generation have monochrome dreams|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|date=October 17, 2008|work=|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationship with medical conditions====
There is evidence that certain medical conditions (normally only neurological conditions) can impact dreams. For instance, some people with [[synesthesia]] have never reported entirely black-and-white dreaming, and often have a difficult time imagining the idea of dreaming in only black and white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Synaesthesia: The Strangest Thing |last=Harrison |first=John E. |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-263245-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
{{Main|Dream interpretation}}
[[File:Сон бабусі і внучки.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An artist's painting of a dream.]]

=== Common interpretations  ===
Dream interpretation can be a result of subjective ideas and experiences. One study&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; found that most people believe that "their dreams reveal meaningful hidden truths". In one study&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 2009. Vol 96, No 2, 249–264&lt;/ref&gt; conducted in the United States, South Korea and India, they found that 74% of Indians, 65% of South Koreans and 56% of Americans believed their dream content provided them with meaningful insight into their unconscious beliefs and desires. This Freudian view of dreaming was endorsed significantly more than theories of dreaming that attribute dream content to memory consolidation, problem-solving, or random brain activity.

=== Importance  ===
In the paper, Morewedge and Norton (2009) also found that people attribute more importance to dream content than to similar thought content that occurs while they are awake. In one study, Americans were more likely to report that they would miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing than if they thought of their plane crashing the night before flying (while awake), and that they would be as likely to miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing the night before their flight as if there was an actual plane crash on the route they intended to take.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Not all dream content was considered equally important. Participants in their studies were more likely to perceive dreams to be meaningful when the content of dreams was in accordance with their beliefs and desires while awake. People were more likely to view a positive dream about a friend to be meaningful than a positive dream about someone they disliked, for example, and were more likely to view a negative dream about a person they disliked as meaningful than a negative dream about a person they liked.

=== Other ===
Therapy for recurring [[nightmares]] (often associated with [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]) can include imagining alternative scenarios that could begin at each step of the dream.&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt;

==Other associated phenomena==
[[File:Dream of Polish volunteers in French army 1914.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A depiction of soldiers' dreams.]]

===Incorporation of reality===
During the night, many external stimuli may bombard the senses, but the brain often interprets the stimulus and makes it a part of a dream to ensure continued sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1993 |title=Characteristics of Dreams |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Sleep and Dreaming |last=Antrobus |first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dream incorporation is a phenomenon whereby an actual sensation, such as environmental sounds, is incorporated into dreams, such as hearing a phone ringing in a dream while it is ringing in reality or dreaming of [[urination]] while [[bedwetting|wetting]] the bed. The mind can, however, awaken an individual if they are in danger or if trained to respond to certain sounds, such as a baby crying.

The term "dream incorporation" is also used in research examining the degree to which preceding daytime events become elements of dreams. Recent studies suggest that events in the day immediately preceding, and those about a week before, have the most influence.&lt;ref name="day-residue"&gt;{{cite web |author=Geneviève Alain, MPs |author2=Tore A. Nielsen, PhD |author3=Russell Powell, PhD |author4=Don Kuiken, PhD |url=http://www.asdreams.org/2003/abstracts/genevieve_alain.htm |title=Replication of the Day-residue and Dream-lag Effect |date=July 2003 |work=20th Annual International Conference of the Association for the Study of Dreams |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030416200751/http://www.asdreams.org/2003/abstracts/genevieve_alain.htm |archivedate=2003-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Alan Fine and Laura Fischer Leighton argue that “dreams are external to the individual mind” because “1) dreams are not willed by the individual self; 2) dreams reflect social reality; 3) dreams are public rhetoric; and 4) dreams are collectively interpretable.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fine|first=Gary Alan|last2=Leighton|first2=Laura Fischer|date=1993-01-01|title=Nocturnal Omissions: Steps Toward a Sociology of Dreams|jstor=10.1525/si.1993.16.2.95|journal=Symbolic Interaction|volume=16|issue=2|pages=95–104|doi=10.1525/si.1993.16.2.95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apparent precognition of real events===
{{Main|Precognition}}

According to surveys, it is common for people to feel their dreams are predicting subsequent life events.&lt;ref name="hines"/&gt; Psychologists have explained these experiences in terms of [[List of memory biases|memory biases]], namely a selective memory for accurate predictions and distorted memory so that dreams are retrospectively fitted onto life experiences.&lt;ref name="hines"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hines |first= Terence |title=Pseudoscience and the Paranormal |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2003 |pages=78–81 |isbn=978-1-57392-979-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multi-faceted nature of dreams makes it easy to find connections between dream content and real events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilovich |first=Thomas |title=How We Know What Isn't So: the fallibility of human reason in everyday life |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |year=1991 |pages= 177–180 |isbn=978-0-02-911706-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "veridical dream" has been used to indicate dreams that reveal or contain truths not yet known to the dreamer, whether future events or secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.llewellyn.com/encyclopedia/term/Veridical+Dream|title=Llewellyn Worldwide – Encyclopedia: Term: Veridical Dream|website=www.llewellyn.com|access-date=2016-10-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018202429/http://www.llewellyn.com/encyclopedia/term/Veridical+Dream|archivedate=2016-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one experiment, subjects were asked to write down their dreams in a diary. This prevented the selective memory effect, and the dreams no longer seemed accurate about the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alcock |first=James E. |title=Parapsychology: Science or Magic?: a psychological perspective |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=Oxford |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-08-025773-0}} via {{cite book |last=Hines |first=Terence |title= Pseudoscience and the Paranormal |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2003 |pages=78–81 |isbn=978-1-57392-979-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another experiment gave subjects a fake diary of a student with apparently precognitive dreams. This diary described events from the person's life, as well as some predictive dreams and some non-predictive dreams. When subjects were asked to recall the dreams they had read, they remembered more of the successful predictions than unsuccessful ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madey |first=Scott |author2=Thomas Gilovich |title=Effects of Temporal Focus on the Recall of Expectancy-Consistent and Expectancy-Inconsistent Information |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=65 |issue=3 |year=1993 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.65.3.458 |pages=458–468 |pmid=8410650}} via {{cite book |last=Kida |first=Thomas |title=Don't Believe Everything You Think: The 6 Basic Mistakes We Make in Thinking |year=2006 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-59102-408-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lucid dreaming===
{{Main|Lucid dreaming}}

Lucid dreaming is the conscious perception of one's state while dreaming. In this state the dreamer may often have some degree of control over their own actions within the dream or even the characters and the environment of the dream. Dream control has been reported to improve with practiced deliberate lucid dreaming, but the ability to control aspects of the dream is not necessary for a dream to qualify as "lucid" — a lucid dream is any dream during which the dreamer knows they are dreaming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychwww.com/asc/ld/faq.html Lucid dreaming FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313100513/http://www.psychwww.com/asc/ld/faq.html |date=2007-03-13 }} by [[The Lucidity Institute]] at Psych Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The occurrence of lucid dreaming has been scientifically verified.&lt;ref name= Watanabe2003&gt;{{cite journal |author=Watanabe, T. |year=2003 |title=Lucid Dreaming: Its Experimental Proof and Psychological Conditions |journal=J Int Soc Life Inf Sci |volume=21 |issue=1 |issn=1341-9226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Oneironaut]]'' is a term sometimes used for those who lucidly dream.

====Communication through lucid dreaming====
In 1975, psychologist Keith Hearne successfully recorded a communication from a dreamer experiencing a lucid dream. On April 12, 1975, after agreeing to move his eyes left and right upon becoming lucid, the subject and Hearne's co-author on the resulting article, Alan Worsley, successfully carried out this task.&lt;ref name="Lucid dream communication"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keithhearne.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/RECHTSCHAFFEN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426081653/http://www.keithhearne.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/RECHTSCHAFFEN.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}, Lucid Dream Communication&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, psychophysiologist Stephen LaBerge conducted similar work including:
*Using eye signals to map the subjective sense of time in dreams.
*Comparing the electrical activity of the brain while singing awake and while dreaming.
*Studies comparing in-dream sex, arousal, and orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;LaBerge, S. (2014). Lucid dreaming: Paradoxes of dreaming consciousness. In E. Cardeña, S. Lynn, S. Krippner (Eds.), Varieties of anomalous experience: Examining the scientific evidence (2nd ed.) (pp. 145–173). Washington, DC US: American Psychological Association. {{DOI|10.1037/14258-006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Communication between two dreamers has also been documented. The processes involved included [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] monitoring, ocular signaling, incorporation of reality in the form of red light stimuli and a coordinating website. The website tracked when both dreamers were dreaming and sent the stimulus to one of the dreamers where it was incorporated into the dream. This dreamer, upon becoming lucid, signaled with eye movements; this was detected by the website whereupon the stimulus was sent to the second dreamer, invoking incorporation into this dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2012/11/08/saying-hi-through-a-dream-how-the-internet-could-make-sleeping-more-social/#2eb99101590c|title=Saying 'Hi' Through A Dream: How The Internet Could Make Sleeping More Social|last=Olson|first=Parmy|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-04-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531010710/http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2012/11/08/saying-hi-through-a-dream-how-the-internet-could-make-sleeping-more-social/#2eb99101590c|archivedate=2016-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absent-minded transgression===
Dreams of absent-minded transgression (DAMT) are dreams wherein the dreamer absentmindedly performs an action that he or she has been trying to stop (one classic example is of a quitting smoker having dreams of lighting a cigarette). Subjects who have had DAMT have reported waking with intense feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. One study found a positive association between having these dreams and successfully stopping the behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hajek P, Belcher M |title=Dream of absent-minded transgression: an empirical study of a cognitive withdrawal symptom |journal=J Abnorm Psychol |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages= 487–91 |year=1991 |pmid=1757662 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.100.4.487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recall===
The recollection of dreams is extremely unreliable, though it is a skill that can be trained. Dreams can usually be recalled if a person is awakened while dreaming.&lt;ref name="npr"/&gt; Women tend to have more frequent dream recall than men.&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15778923 |title=The Science Behind Dreams and Nightmares |publisher=Npr.org |accessdate=April 4, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822180530/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15778923 |archivedate=August 22, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreams that are difficult to recall may be characterized by relatively little [[affect (psychology)|affect]], and factors such as [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]], [[arousal]], and interference play a role in dream recall. Often, a dream may be recalled upon viewing or hearing a random trigger or stimulus. The ''salience hypothesis'' proposes that dream content that is salient, that is, novel, intense, or unusual, is more easily remembered. There is considerable evidence that vivid, intense, or unusual dream content is more frequently recalled.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(02)00114-9|title=To dream, perchance to remember: Individual differences in dream recall|year=2003|last1=Watson|first1=David|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=34|issue=7|pages=1271–1286}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[dream journal]] can be used to assist dream recall, for personal interest or [[psychotherapy]] purposes.

For some people, sensations from the previous night's dreams are sometimes spontaneously experienced in falling asleep. However they are usually too slight and fleeting to allow dream recall. At least 95% of all dreams are not remembered. Certain brain chemicals necessary for converting short-term memories into long-term ones are suppressed during REM sleep. Unless a dream is particularly vivid and if one wakes during or immediately after it, the content of the dream is not remembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hobson | first1 = J.A. | last2 = McCarly | first2 = R.W. | year = 1977 | title = The brain as a dream-state generator: An activation-synthesis hypothesis of the dream process | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 134 | issue = 12| pages = 1335–1348 | pmid = 21570 | doi=10.1176/ajp.134.12.1335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recording or reconstructing dreams may one day assist with dream recall.

====Individual differences====
In line with the salience hypothesis, there is considerable evidence that people who have more vivid, intense or unusual dreams show better recall. There is evidence that continuity of consciousness is related to recall. Specifically, people who have vivid and unusual experiences during the day tend to have more memorable dream content and hence better dream recall. People who score high on measures of personality traits associated with creativity, imagination, and fantasy, such as [[openness to experience]], [[daydreaming]], [[fantasy prone personality|fantasy proneness]], [[absorption (psychology)|absorption]], and [[hypnotic susceptibility]], tend to show more frequent dream recall.&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; There is also evidence for continuity between the bizarre aspects of dreaming and waking experience. That is, people who report more bizarre experiences during the day, such as people high in [[schizotypy]] (psychosis proneness) have more frequent dream recall and also report more frequent [[nightmares]].&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt;

===Déjà vu===
{{Main|Déjà vu}}

One theory of déjà vu attributes the feeling of having previously seen or experienced something to having dreamed about a similar situation or place, and forgetting about it until one seems to be mysteriously reminded of the situation or the place while awake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dream Directory: The Comprehensive Guide to Analysis and Interpretation |last=Lohff |first=David C. |year=2004 |publisher=Running Press |isbn=978-0-7624-1962-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daydreaming===
{{Main|Daydreaming}}

A daydream is a visionary [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]], especially one of happy, pleasant thoughts, hopes or ambitions, imagined as coming to pass, and experienced while awake.&lt;ref name="Klinger"&gt;Klinger, Eric (October 1987). ''[[Psychology Today]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different types of daydreams, and there is no consistent definition amongst [[psychologists]].&lt;ref name="Klinger"/&gt; The general public also uses the term for a broad variety of experiences. Research by Harvard psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]] has found that people who experience vivid dream-like [[mental image]]s reserve the word for these, whereas many other people refer to milder imagery, realistic future planning, review of past memories or just "spacing out"—i.e. one's mind going relatively blank—when they talk about "daydreaming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barrett | first1 = D. L. | year = 1979 | title = The Hypnotic Dream: Its Content in Comparison to Nocturnal Dreams and Waking Fantasy | url = | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 88 | issue = 5| pages = 584–591 | doi=10.1037/0021-843x.88.5.584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, D.

Hypnosis and Hypnotherapy, (2 vol.): Vol. 1: History, theory and general research, Vol. 2: Psychotherapy research and applications, NY, NY: Praeger/Greenwood, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

While daydreaming has long been derided as a lazy, non-productive pastime, it is now commonly acknowledged that daydreaming can be constructive in some contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Tierney |authorlink=John Tierney (journalist) |title=Discovering the Virtues of a Wandering Mind |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/science/29tier.html?src=me&amp;ref=general |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 28, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421104306/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/science/29tier.html?src=me&amp;ref=general |archivedate=April 21, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous examples of people in [[creativity|creative]] or artistic careers, such as [[musical composer|composers]], [[novelist]]s and [[filmmaker]]s, developing new ideas through daydreaming. Similarly, research [[scientist]]s, [[mathematician]]s and [[physicist]]s have developed new ideas by daydreaming about their subject areas.

===Hallucination===
{{Main|Hallucination}}

A hallucination, in the broadest sense of the word, is a [[perception]] in the absence of a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. In a stricter sense, hallucinations are perceptions in a conscious and awake state, in the absence of external stimuli, and have qualities of real perception, in that they are vivid, substantial, and located in external objective space. The latter definition distinguishes hallucinations from the related phenomena of dreaming, which does not involve wakefulness.

===Nightmare===
{{Main|Nightmare}}
[[File:A perturbed young woman fast asleep Wellcome V0016638.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An artist's depiction of a woman having a nightmare.]]
A nightmare is an unpleasant dream that can cause a strong negative emotional response from the mind, typically [[fear]] or [[horror and terror|horror]], but also [[despair (emotion)|despair]], [[anxiety]] and great [[sadness]]. The dream may contain situations of danger, discomfort, psychological or physical terror. Sufferers usually awaken in a state of distress and may be unable to return to [[sleep]] for a prolonged period of time.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association (2000), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed, TR, p. 631&lt;/ref&gt;

===Night terror===
{{Main|Night terror}}

A night terror, also known as a sleep terror or ''pavor nocturnus'', is a [[parasomnia]] [[sleep disorder|disorder]] that predominantly affects children, causing feelings of terror or dread. Night terrors should not be confused with [[nightmare]]s, which are bad dreams that cause the feeling of horror or fear.

In [[reliability engineering]], '''dual modular redundancy''' ('''DMR''') is when components of a system are duplicated, providing [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] in case one should fail. It is particularly applied to systems where the duplicated components work in parallel, particularly in [[fault-tolerant computer system]]s. A typical example is a complex computer system which has duplicated nodes, so that should one node fail, another is ready to carry on its work.

DMR provides robustness to the failure of one component, and [[error detection]] in case instruments or computers that should give the same result give different results, but does not provide [[error correction]], as ''which'' component is correct and which is malfunctioning cannot be automatically determined. There is an old adage to this effect, stating: "Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 0-201-83595-9 | title = [[The Mythical Man-Month]] | last = Brooks | first = Frederick J. | authorlink = Fred Brooks | year = 1995 | origyear = 1975 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | page = 64  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meaning, if two [[Marine chronometer|chronometers]] contradict, how do you know which one is correct?

A [[lockstep (computing)|lockstep]] fault-tolerant machine uses replicated elements operating in parallel. At any time, all the replications of each element should be in the same state. The same inputs are provided to each replication, and the same outputs are expected. The outputs of the replications are compared using a voting circuit. A machine with two replications of each element is termed dual modular redundant (DMR). The voting circuit can then only detect a mismatch and recovery relies on other methods.  Examples include [[1ESS switch]].

A machine with three replications of each element is termed [[triple modular redundancy|triple modular redundant]] (TMR). The voting circuit can determine which replication is in error when a two-to-one vote is observed. In this case, the voting circuit can output the correct result, and discard the erroneous version. After this, the internal state of the erroneous replication is assumed to be different from that of the other two, and the voting circuit can switch to a DMR mode. This model can be applied to any larger number of replications.

{{Rights |Human}}
'''Economic, social and cultural rights''' are [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] [[human rights]], such as the [[right to education]], [[right to housing]], [[right to adequate standard of living]], [[right to health]], [[victims' rights]] and the [[right to science and culture]]. Economic, social and cultural rights are recognised and protected in international and regional human rights instruments. Member states have a legal obligation to respect, protect and fulfil economic, social and cultural rights and are expected to take "progressive action" towards their fulfilment.

The [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]] recognises a number of economic, social and cultural rights and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) is the primary international legal source of economic, social and cultural rights. The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] recognises and protects many of the economic, social and cultural rights recognised in the ICESCR in relation to children and women. The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] prohibits discrimination on the basis of racial or ethnic origin in relation to a number of economic, social and cultural rights. The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] also prohibits all discrimination on the basis of the disability including refusal of the [[reasonable accommodation]] relating to full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.

== International and regional human rights instruments ==
Economic, social and cultural rights are recognized and protected in a number of international and regional human rights instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xiv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International human rights instruments ===
The [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]] (UDHR), adopted by the [[UN General Assembly]] in 1948, is one of the most important sources of economic, social and cultural rights. It recognizes the [[right to social security]] in Article 22, the [[right to work]] in Article 23, the [[right to rest and leisure]] in Article 24, the [[right to an adequate standard of living]] in Article 25, the [[right to education]] in Article 26, and the [[right to benefits of science and culture]] in Article 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xiv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) is the primary international legal source of economic, social and cultural rights. The Covenant recognized and protects the [[right to work]] and to just and favorable working conditions in Article 6 and 7, the right to join [[trade unions]] and take collective labor action in Article 8, the [[right to social security]] in Article 9, the right to protection of the family, including protection for mothers and children, in Article 10, the [[right to an adequate standard of living]], including the [[right to food]] and the [[right to housing]], in Article 11, the [[right to health]] in Article 12, the [[right to education]] in Article 13, as well as the right to participate in cultural life and  the [[right to benefits of science and culture]] in Article 15. The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], adopted at the same time as the ICESCR, recognizes and protects a number of core economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to join [[trade unions]] in Article 22, and the right of ethnic, religious or linguistic [[minority group|minorities]] to engage in their culture, practice their religion and use their language in Article 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xiv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other major international human rights instruments contain provisions relating to economic, social and cultural rights. The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] recognizes and protects many of the economic, social and cultural rights recognized in the ICESCR in relation to children. Including the [[right to health]] in Article 24, the [[right to social security]] in Article 25, the right to an adequate standard of living in Article 27, the [[right to education]] in Article 28, and the right to protection from economic exploitation (see [[child labour]]) in Article 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xiv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] prohibits discrimination on the basis of racial or ethnic origin in relation to a number of economic, social and cultural rights. The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] affirms a range of economic, social and cultural rights to women. The [[ILO Conventions]] of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) protect a range of work related economic, social and cultural rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional human rights instruments ===
The [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] protects the [[right to work]] in Article 15, the [[right to health]] in Article 16, and the [[right to education]] in Article 17. The [[European Social Charter]] protects a wide range of economic, social and cultural rights, including the [[right to work]], to favourable working conditions, the right to join [[trade unions]] and to take collective labour action in Article 1 to 10, the [[right to health]] in Article 11, the [[right to social security]], including the right to medical assistance and the right to social welfare services, in Article 12 to 14, protection of especially [[social vulnerability|vulnerable groups]] are enshrined in Article 15 to 17 and 19, and [[right to housing]] in Article 31. The [[Protocol of San Salvador]] protects a range of economic, social and cultural rights within the Inter-American human rights system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secondary legal sources ==
A range of secondary legal sources exist on economic, social and cultural rights which provide guidance on their normative definition. An important secondary legal source is the [[United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] which is overseeing the implementation of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR). The Committee has been central in developing the normative definition of key economic, social and cultural rights, interpreting the role of State Parties to the ICESCR, and monitoring protection and violation of the ICESCR rights. The Committee issues guiding pronouncements in the form of ''general comments'', and other human rights treaty bodies may also issue comments relevant to economic, social and cultural rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xv | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important secondary legal sources on economic, social and cultural rights are the [[Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] 1987 and the [[Maastricht Guidelines on Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] 1997. The Limburg Principles have been extensively used in national legal systems as an interpretive tool for establishing violations of economic, social and cultural rights. The Maastricht Guidelines build on the Limburg Principles and identify the legal implications of acts and omissions which are violations of economic, social and cultural rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xv-xvi | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[United Nations Special Rapporteurs]] have influenced the normative development of economic, social and cultural rights. Appointed by the [[Commission on Human Rights]] and its sub-commissions, key rapporteurs include the Special Rapporteur on the Realization of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Education, and the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xvi | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National constitutions ==
A number of national constitutions recognize economic, social and cultural rights. For example, the 1996 [[Constitution of South Africa]]  includes economic, social and cultural rights and the [[South African Constitutional Court]] has heard claims under these obligations (see ''[[Grootboom]]'' and ''[[Treatment Action Campaign]]'' cases). [[India's constitution]], which does not explicitly recognize economic and social rights in their constitution, has nonetheless found that these rights exist, though [[unenumerated rights|unenumerated]], inferable from the right to life. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

== State responsibility ==
Economic, social and cultural right enshrined in international and regional human rights instruments are legally binding. Member states have a legal obligation to respect, protect and fulfil these rights. The exact nature of states' obligations in this respect has been established principally in relation to the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xvi | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] has been established in accordance with [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], Part II paragraph 75&lt;/ref&gt;

State parties to the ICESCR are required to take "progressive action" towards fulfilment of the ICESR rights. While immediate fulfilment may not be possible due to the economic situation of a country, postponement of proactive action is not permitted. State parties must show genuine efforts to secure the economic, social and cultural rights enshrined in the ICESCR. The burden of proof for progressive action is considered on be with the state party. The prohibition on [[discrimination]] in relation to economic, social and cultural rights is regarded as having immediate effect. State parties must abolish laws, policies and practices which affect the equal enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights and take action to prevent discrimination in public life. All state parties, regardless of the economic situation in the country or resource scarcity, are required to ensure respect for minimum subsistence rights for all. State parties must also ensure that available resources are accessed and used equitably. Therefore, government decisions on how to allocate resources should be subject to scrutiny. Legislative measures alone are not sufficient to ensure compliance with the ICESCR and state parties are expected to provide judicial remedies in addition to taking administrative, financial, educational and social measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xvi-xvii | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Monitoring, enforcement and implementation framework ==
[[Intergovernmental organisations]] and [[non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs) have persistently neglected economic, social and cultural rights over the past 50 years.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} While all human rights are said to be "equal, indivisible, interrelated, and interdependent", the monitoring, enforcement and implementation framework for economic, social and cultural rights is less advanced than that for [[civil and political rights]]. International enforcement mechanisms are strongest for civil and political rights, and their violation is considered more serious than that of economic, social and cultural rights. There are few international NGOs that focus on economic, social and cultural rights and there are few lawyers who have the knowledge or experience to defend economic, social and cultural rights at a national or international level. Economic, social and cultural rights are less likely than civil and political rights to be protected in national constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leckie| first = Scott|author2=Gallanger, Anne| title = Economic, social and cultural rights: a legal resource guide| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| year = 2006| pages =xiii | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nvVqLUM1tiQC&amp;dq=Economic,+social+and+cultural+rights&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-8122-3916-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], which gives the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] competence to receive and consider communications from individuals claiming that their rights under the Covenant have been violated by a state party. The Protocol entered into force on 5 May 2013.

== Advocacy ==
Networking groups such as [[ESCR-Net]] are working to create online resources and spread information about effective cases, initiatives, and working groups promoting ideals and celebrating victories of human rights initiatives and the [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]. Currently, human rights advocacy groups are working diligently to fine-tune rules, regulations and implementation schemes; little news of complaint successes or failures is available.&lt;ref&gt;“Campaign for the Ratification and Implementation of the Optional Protocol to the ICESCR-Justice NOW!

== Theory of rights ==
According to [[Karel Vasak]]'s theory of [[three generations of human rights]], economic, social and cultural rights are considered second-generation rights, while [[civil and political rights]], such as [[freedom of speech]], [[right to a fair trial]], and the [[right to vote]], are considered first-generation rights.&lt;ref&gt;Karel Vasak, "Human Rights: A Thirty-Year Struggle: the Sustained Efforts to give Force of law to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights", ''UNESCO Courier'' 30:11, Paris: [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization]], November 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of [[negative and positive rights]] considers economic, social and cultural rights [[positive rights]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

--&gt;{{General relativity sidebar |fundamentals}}

In the [[theory]] of [[general relativity]], the '''equivalence principle''' is the equivalence of [[Gravitational mass|gravitational]] and [[Mass#Inertial mass|inertial mass]], and [[Albert Einstein's]] observation that the gravitational "force" as experienced locally while standing on a massive body (such as the Earth) is the same as the ''[[fictitious force|pseudo-force]]'' experienced by an observer in a non-[[inertial frame of reference|inertial]] (accelerated) [[frame of reference]].

== Einstein's statement of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass ==
{{Quotation|
A little reflection will show that the law of the equality of the inertial and gravitational mass is equivalent to the assertion that the acceleration imparted to a body by a gravitational field is independent of the nature of the body. For Newton's equation of motion in a gravitational field, written out in full, it is:
:(Inertial mass) &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; (Acceleration) &lt;math&gt; = &lt;/math&gt; (Intensity of the gravitational field) &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; (Gravitational mass).
It is only when there is numerical equality between the inertial and gravitational mass that the acceleration is independent of the nature of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert, ''How I Constructed the Theory of Relativity'', translated by Masahiro Morikawa from the text recorded in Japanese by Jun Ishiwara, Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies (AAPPS) Bulletin, Vol. 15, No. 2, pp. 17–19, April 2005. Einstein recalls events of 1907 in a talk in Japan on 14 December 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=The Meaning of Relativity|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134449798|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

== Development of gravitation theory ==
[[File:Apollo 15 feather and hammer drop.ogv|right|thumb|During the [[Apollo 15]] mission in 1971, astronaut [[David Scott]] showed that Galileo was right: acceleration is the same for all bodies subject to gravity on the Moon, even for a hammer and a feather.]]Something like the equivalence principle emerged in the early 17th century, when [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] expressed [[experiment]]ally that the [[acceleration]] of a [[test mass]] due to [[gravitation]] is independent of the amount of [[mass]] being accelerated.

Kepler, using Galileo's discoveries, showed knowledge of the equivalence principle by accurately describing what would occur if the moon were stopped in its orbit and dropped towards Earth. This can be deduced without knowing if or in what manner gravity decreases with distance, but requires assuming the equivalency between gravity and inertia.

{{quote|If two stones were placed in any part of the world near each other, and beyond the sphere of influence of a third cognate body, these stones, like two magnetic needles, would come together in the intermediate point, each approaching the other by a space proportional to the comparative mass of the other. If the moon and earth were not retained in their orbits by their animal force or some other equivalent, the earth would mount to the moon by a fifty-fourth part of their distance, and the moon fall towards the earth through the other fifty-three parts, and they would there meet, assuming, however, that the substance of both is of the same density.|Kepler, "Astronomia Nova", 1609&lt;ref&gt;http://quotes.yourdictionary.com/orbits/quote/71225/&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The 1/54 ratio is [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s estimate of the Moon–Earth mass ratio, based on their diameters. The accuracy of his statement can be deduced by using [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s inertia law F=ma and Galileo's gravitational observation that distance &lt;math&gt;D = (1/2)at^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Setting these accelerations equal for a mass is the equivalence principle. Noting the time to collision for each mass is the same gives Kepler's statement that D&lt;sub&gt;moon&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;=M&lt;sub&gt;Earth&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;moon&lt;/sub&gt;, without knowing the time to collision or how or if the acceleration force from gravity is a function of distance.

Newton's [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational theory]] simplified and formalized [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s and Kepler's ideas by recognizing Kepler's "animal force or some other equivalent" beyond gravity and inertia were not needed, deducing from Kepler's planetary laws how gravity reduces with distance.

The equivalence principle was properly introduced by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1907, when he observed that the acceleration of bodies towards the center of the Earth at a rate of 1''[[g-force|''g'']]'' (''g'' = 9.81&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; being a standard reference of gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface) is equivalent to the acceleration of an inertially moving body that would be observed on a rocket in free space being accelerated at a rate of 1''g''. Einstein stated it thus:

{{quote|we [...] assume the complete physical equivalence of a gravitational field and a corresponding [[accelerated reference frame|acceleration of the reference system]].|Einstein, 1907}}

That is, being on the surface of the Earth is equivalent to being inside a spaceship (far from any sources of gravity) that is being accelerated by its engines. The direction or vector of acceleration equivalence on the surface of the earth is "up" or directly opposite the center of the planet while the vector of acceleration in a spaceship is directly opposite from the mass ejected by its thrusters. From this principle, Einstein deduced that [[free-fall]] is [[inertial frame|inertial motion]]. Objects in free-fall do not experience being accelerated downward (e.g. toward the earth or other massive body) but rather weightlessness and no acceleration. In an [[inertial frame of reference]] bodies (and photons, or light) obey [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's first law|Newton's first law]], moving at constant velocity in straight lines. Analogously, in a curved [[spacetime]] the [[world line]] of an inertial particle or pulse of light is ''as straight as possible'' (in space ''and'' time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/EGR.pdf |page=32 |title=General Relativity in a Nutshell |first=Alan |last=Macdonald |date=September 15, 2012 |accessdate=February 8, 2013 |publisher=[[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a world line is called a [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic]] and from the point of view of the inertial frame is a straight line. This is why an [[accelerometer]] in free-fall doesn't register any acceleration; there isn't any.

As an example: an inertial body moving along a geodesic through space can be trapped into an orbit around a large gravitational mass without ever experiencing acceleration. This is possible because spacetime is radically curved in close vicinity to a large gravitational mass. In such a situation the [[geodesic]] lines bend inward around the center of the mass and a free-floating (weightless) inertial body will simply follow those curved geodesics into an elliptical orbit. An accelerometer on-board would never record any acceleration.

By contrast, in [[Newtonian mechanics]], [[gravity]] is assumed to be a [[force]]. This force draws objects having mass towards the center of any massive body. At the Earth's surface, the force of gravity is counteracted by the mechanical (physical) resistance of the Earth's surface. So in Newtonian physics, a person at rest on the surface of a (non-rotating) massive object is in an inertial frame of reference. These considerations suggest the following corollary to the equivalence principle, which Einstein formulated precisely in 1911:

{{quote|Whenever an observer detects the local presence of a force that acts on all objects in direct proportion to the inertial mass of each object, that observer is in an accelerated frame of reference.}}

Einstein also referred to two reference frames, K and K'. K is a uniform gravitational field, whereas K' has no gravitational field but is [[uniform acceleration|uniformly accelerated]] such that objects in the two frames experience identical forces:

{{quote|We arrive at a very satisfactory interpretation of this law of experience, if we assume that the systems K and K' are physically exactly equivalent, that is, if we assume that we may just as well regard the system K as being in a space free from gravitational fields, if we then regard K as uniformly accelerated. This assumption of exact physical equivalence makes it impossible for us to speak of the absolute acceleration of the system of reference, just as the usual theory of relativity forbids us to talk of the absolute velocity of a system; and it makes the equal falling of all bodies in a gravitational field seem a matter of course.|Einstein, 1911}}

This observation was the start of a process that culminated in [[general relativity]]. Einstein suggested that it should be elevated to the status of a general principle, which he called the "principle of equivalence" when constructing his theory of relativity:

{{quote|As long as we restrict ourselves to purely mechanical processes in the realm where Newton's mechanics holds sway, we are certain of the equivalence of the systems K and K'. But this view of ours will not have any deeper significance unless the systems K and K' are equivalent with respect to all physical processes, that is, unless the laws of nature with respect to K are in entire agreement with those with respect to K'. By assuming this to be so, we arrive at a principle which, if it is really true, has great heuristic importance. For by theoretical consideration of processes which take place relatively to a system of reference with uniform acceleration, we obtain information as to the career of processes in a homogeneous gravitational field.|Einstein, 1911}}

Einstein combined ([[postulate]]d) the equivalence principle with [[special relativity]] to predict that clocks run at different rates in a [[gravitational potential]], and light rays [[bending of starlight|bend]] in a gravitational field, even before he developed the concept of curved spacetime.

So the original equivalence principle, as described by Einstein, concluded that free-fall and inertial motion were physically equivalent. This form of the equivalence principle can be stated as follows. An observer in a windowless room cannot distinguish between being on the surface of the Earth, and being in a spaceship in deep space accelerating at 1g. This is not strictly true, because massive bodies give rise to [[tidal force|tidal effects]] (caused by variations in the strength and direction of the gravitational field) which are absent from an accelerating spaceship in deep space. The room, therefore, should be small enough that tidal effects can be neglected.

Although the equivalence principle guided the development of [[general relativity]], it is not a founding principle of relativity but rather a simple consequence of the ''geometrical'' nature of the theory. In general relativity, objects in free-fall follow [[Geodesic (general relativity)|geodesic]]s of spacetime, and what we perceive as the force of [[gravity]] is instead a result of our being unable to follow those geodesics of spacetime, because the mechanical resistance of matter prevents us from doing so.

Since Einstein developed general relativity, there was a need to develop a framework to test the theory against other possible theories of gravity compatible with [[special relativity]]. This was developed by [[Robert H. Dicke|Robert Dicke]] as part of his program to test general relativity. Two new principles were suggested, the so-called Einstein equivalence principle and the strong equivalence principle, each of which assumes the weak equivalence principle as a starting point. They only differ in whether or not they apply to gravitational experiments.

Another clarification needed is that the equivalence principle assumes a constant acceleration of 1g without considering the mechanics of generating 1g. If we do consider the mechanics of it, then we must assume the aforementioned windowless room has a fixed mass. Accelerating it at 1g means there is a constant force being applied, which = m*g where m is the mass of the windowless room along with its contents (including the observer). Now, if the observer jumps inside the room, an object lying freely on the floor will decrease in weight momentarily because the acceleration is going to decrease momentarily due to the observer pushing back against the floor in order to jump. The object will then gain weight while the observer is in the air and the resulting decreased mass of the windowless room allows greater acceleration; it will lose weight again when the observer lands and pushes once more against the floor; and it will finally return to its initial weight afterwards. To make all these effects equal those we would measure on a planet producing 1g, the windowless room must be assumed to have the same mass as that planet. Additionally, the windowless room must not cause its own gravity, otherwise the scenario changes even further. These are technicalities, clearly, but practical ones if we wish the experiment to demonstrate more or less precisely the equivalence of 1g gravity and 1g acceleration.

==Modern usage==
Three forms of the equivalence principle are in current use: weak (Galilean), Einsteinian, and strong.

===The weak equivalence principle===
&lt;!-- Universality of free fall and weak equivalence principle redirect to this subsection.  Please do not change its title without making sure the redirects work properly. --&gt;
The '''weak equivalence principle''', also known as the '''universality of free fall''' or the '''Galilean equivalence principle''' can be stated in many ways.  The strong EP includes (astronomic) bodies with gravitational binding energy&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Todd A.; Schlamminger, Stephan; Gundlach, Jens H.; Adelberger, Eric G.; "Torsion-balance tests of the weak equivalence principle", ''Classical and Quantum Gravity'' 29, 184002 (2012); https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2442&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., 1.74 solar-mass pulsar PSR J1903+0327, 15.3% of whose separated mass is absent as gravitational binding energy&lt;ref&gt;Champion, David J.; Ransom, Scott M.; Lazarus, Patrick; Camilo, Fernando; et al.; ''Science'' 320(5881), 1309 (2008), https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2396&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2018}}).  The weak EP assumes falling bodies are bound by non-gravitational forces only. Either way:

:The trajectory of a point mass in a gravitational field depends only on its initial position and velocity, and is independent of its composition and ''structure''.

:All test particles at the alike spacetime point, in a given gravitational field, will undergo the same acceleration, independent of their properties, including their rest mass.&lt;ref name="Wesson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Five-dimensional Physics |first=Paul S. |last=Wesson |page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dSv8ksxHR0oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:Five+intitle:Dimensional+intitle:Physics |isbn=978-981-256-661-4 |publisher=World Scientific |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:All local centers of mass free-fall (in vacuum) along identical (parallel-displaced, same speed) minimum action trajectories independent of all observable properties.

:The vacuum world-line of a body immersed in a gravitational field is independent of all observable properties.

:The local effects of motion in a curved spacetime (gravitation) are indistinguishable from those of an accelerated observer in flat spacetime, without exception.

:Mass (measured with a balance) and weight (measured with a scale) are locally in identical ratio for all bodies (the opening page to Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', 1687).

'''Locality''' eliminates measurable tidal forces originating from a radial divergent gravitational field (e.g., the Earth) upon finite sized physical bodies.  The "falling" equivalence principle embraces Galileo's, Newton's, and Einstein's conceptualization.  The equivalence principle does not deny the existence of measurable effects caused by a ''rotating'' gravitating mass ([[frame dragging]]), or bear on the measurements of [[General relativity#Light deflection and gravitational time delay|light deflection and gravitational time delay]] made by non-local observers.

==== Active, passive, and inertial masses ====

By definition of active and passive gravitational mass, the force on &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; due to the gravitational field of &lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is:

::&lt;math&gt;F_1 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
Likewise the force on a second object of arbitrary mass&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; due to the gravitational field of mass&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is:

::&lt;math&gt;F_2 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}  M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

By definition of inertial mass:

::&lt;math&gt;F = m^\mathrm{inert} a&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; are the same distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; then, by the weak equivalence principle, they fall at the same rate (i.e. their accelerations are the same)

::&lt;math&gt;a_1 = \frac{F_1}{m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = a_2 = \frac{F_2}{m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2 m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}  M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2 m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{m_1^\mathrm{inert}} = \frac{M_2^\mathrm{pass}}{m_2^\mathrm{inert}}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, passive gravitational mass must be proportional to inertial mass for all objects.

Furthermore, by [[Newton's third law of motion]]:

::&lt;math&gt;F_1 = \frac{M_0^\mathrm{act} M_1^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
must be equal and opposite to

::&lt;math&gt;F_0 = \frac{M_1^\mathrm{act}  M_0^\mathrm{pass}}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{M_0^\mathrm{act}}{M_0^\mathrm{pass}} = \frac{M_1^\mathrm{act}}{M_1^\mathrm{pass}}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, passive gravitational mass must be proportional to active gravitational mass for all objects.

The dimensionless Eötvös-parameter &lt;math&gt;\eta(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is the difference of the ratios of gravitational and inertial masses divided by their average for the two sets of test masses "A" and "B."

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(A,B)=2\frac{ \left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_A-\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_B }{\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_A+\left(\frac{m_g}{m_i}\right)_B}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- I have created [[User talk:Lemmiwinks2#Redundant edits (active, passive, and inertial masses)|a list of known places where the above material appears]]. --&gt;

====Tests of the weak equivalence principle====

Tests of the weak equivalence principle are those that verify the equivalence of gravitational mass and inertial mass. An obvious test is dropping different objects, ideally in a vacuum environment, e.g., inside the [[Fallturm Bremen]] drop tower.

With the first successful production of antimatter, in particular anti-hydrogen, a new approach to test the weak equivalence principle has been proposed. Experiments to compare the gravitational behavior of matter and antimatter are currently being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Testing the Weak Equivalence Principle with an antimatter beam at CERN|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|date=2015|volume=631|issue=1|page=012047|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1742-6596/631/i=1/a=012047|bibcode = 2015JPhCS.631a2047K |doi = 10.1088/1742-6596/631/1/012047 |last1=Kimura|first1=M.|last2=Aghion|first2=S.|last3=Amsler|first3=C.|last4=Ariga|first4=A.|last5=Ariga|first5=T.|last6=Belov|first6=A.|last7=Bonomi|first7=G.|last8=Bräunig|first8=P.|last9=Bremer|first9=J.|last10=Brusa|first10=R.

Proposals that may lead to a [[quantum gravity|quantum theory of gravity]] such as [[string theory]] and [[loop quantum gravity]] predict violations of the weak equivalence principle because they contain many light [[scalar field]]s with long [[Compton wavelength]]s, which should generate [[fifth force]]s and variation of the fundamental constants. Heuristic arguments suggest that the magnitude of these equivalence principle violations could be in the 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; range.&lt;ref name="Overduin2009" /&gt; Currently envisioned tests of the weak equivalence principle are approaching a degree of sensitivity such that ''non-discovery'' of a violation would be just as profound a result as discovery of a violation. Non-discovery of equivalence principle violation in this range would suggest that gravity is so fundamentally different from other forces as to require a major reevaluation of current attempts to unify gravity with the other forces of nature. A positive detection, on the other hand, would provide a major guidepost towards unification.&lt;ref name="Overduin2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Overduin | first1 = James | last2 = Everitt | first2 = Francis | last3 = Mester | first3 = John | last4 = Worden | first4 = Paul | title = The Science Case for STEP | doi = 10.1016/j.asr.2009.02.012 | journal = Advances in Space Research | volume = 43 | issue = 10 | pages = 1532–1537 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0902.2247 |bibcode = 2009AdSpR..43.1532O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Einstein equivalence principle===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gravitational field]] --&gt;
What is now called the "Einstein equivalence principle" states that the weak equivalence principle holds, and that:&lt;ref name="Lāmmerzahl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haugen |first=Mark P. |first2=Claus |last2=Lämmerzahl |title=Principles of Equivalence: Their Role in Gravitation Physics and Experiments that Test Them |journal=Gyros |volume=562 |pages=195–212 |year=2001 |isbn=978-3-540-41236-6 |arxiv=gr-qc/0103067|bibcode=2001LNP...562..195H |doi=10.1007/3-540-40988-2_10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment in a freely falling laboratory is independent of the velocity of the laboratory and its location in spacetime.''
Here "local" has a very special meaning: not only must the experiment not look outside the laboratory, but it must also be small compared to variations in the gravitational field, [[tidal forces]], so that the entire laboratory is freely falling. It also implies the absence of interactions with "external" fields ''other than the gravitational field''.{{Citation needed|reason = Definition of "local" in this context. In particular its relation to external fields as stated is dubious. If there are external fields than the equivalence principle doesn't trigger due to the "in a freely falling"-part in the statement. If *no external fields* would be part of the definition of "local", then "free falling" would be redundant.|date=August 2011}}

The [[principle of relativity]] implies that the outcome of local experiments must be independent of the velocity of the apparatus, so the most important consequence of this principle is the Copernican idea that [[dimensionless]] physical values such as the [[fine-structure constant]] and [[electron]]-to-[[proton]] mass ratio must not depend on where in space or time we measure them.  Many physicists believe that any [[Lorentz invariance|Lorentz invariant]] theory that satisfies the weak equivalence principle also satisfies the Einstein equivalence principle.

''[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture'' suggests that the weak equivalence principle implies the Einstein equivalence principle, but it has not been proven. Nonetheless, the two principles are tested with very different kinds of experiments. The Einstein equivalence principle has been criticized as imprecise, because there is no universally accepted way to distinguish gravitational from non-gravitational experiments (see for instance Hadley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark J. |last=Hadley |doi=10.1007/BF02764119 |journal=Foundations of Physics Letters |volume=10 |issue=1 |title=The Logic of Quantum Mechanics Derived from Classical General Relativity |pages=43–60 |year=1997 |arxiv=quant-ph/9706018|bibcode = 1997FoPhL..10...43H |citeseerx=10.1.1.252.6335 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Durand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Durand | first1 = Stéphane | year = 2002| title = An amusing analogy: modelling quantum-type behaviours with wormhole-based time travel | url = http://stacks.iop.org/ob/4/S351 | journal = Journal of Optics B: Quantum and Semiclassical Optics | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = S351–S357| doi = 10.1088/1464-4266/4/4/319 | bibcode = 2002JOptB...4S.351D }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

====Tests of the Einstein equivalence principle====
In addition to the tests of the weak equivalence principle, the Einstein equivalence principle can be tested by searching for variation of [[dimensionless]] [[fundamental physical constants|constants and mass ratios]]. The present best limits on the variation of the fundamental constants have mainly been set by studying the naturally occurring [[Oklo]] [[natural nuclear fission reactor]], where nuclear reactions similar to ones we observe today have been shown to have occurred underground approximately two billion years ago. These reactions are extremely sensitive to the values of the fundamental constants.

There have been a number of controversial attempts to constrain the variation of the [[strong interaction]] constant. There have been several suggestions that "constants" do vary on cosmological scales. The best known is the reported detection of variation (at the 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; level) of the fine-structure constant from measurements of distant [[quasar]]s, see Webb et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=John K. |last1=Webb |first2=Michael T. |last2=Murphy |first3=Victor V. |last3=Flambaum |first4=Vladimir A. |last4=Dzuba |first5=John D. |last5=Barrow |first6=Chris W. |last6=Churchill |first7=Jason X. |last7=Prochaska |first8=Arthur M. |last8=Wolfe |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.091301 |journal=Physical Review Letters |title=Further Evidence for Cosmological Evolution of the Fine Structure Constant |volume=87 |issue=9 |year=2001 |arxiv=astro-ph/0012539 |pmid=11531558 |bibcode=2001PhRvL..87i1301W |pages=091301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers{{who|date=November 2018}} dispute these findings. Other tests of the Einstein equivalence principle are [[gravitational redshift]] experiments, such as the [[Pound–Rebka experiment]] which test the position independence of experiments.

===The strong equivalence principle===
The strong equivalence principle suggests the laws of gravitation are independent of velocity and location. In particular,
:''The gravitational motion of a small test body depends only on its initial position in spacetime and velocity, and not on its constitution.''
and
: ''The outcome of any local experiment (gravitational or not) in a freely falling laboratory is independent of the velocity of the laboratory and its location in spacetime.''
The first part is a version of the weak equivalence principle that applies to objects that exert a gravitational force on themselves, such as stars, planets, black holes or [[Cavendish experiment]]s. The second part is the Einstein equivalence principle (with the same definition of "local"), restated to allow gravitational experiments and self-gravitating bodies. The freely-falling object or laboratory, however, must still be small, so that tidal forces may be neglected (hence "local experiment").

This is the only form of the equivalence principle that applies to self-gravitating objects (such as stars), which have substantial internal gravitational interactions. It requires that the [[gravitational constant]] be the same everywhere in the universe and is incompatible with a [[fifth force]]. It is much more restrictive than the Einstein equivalence principle.

The strong equivalence principle suggests that gravity is entirely geometrical by nature (that is, the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] alone determines the effect of gravity) and does not have any extra fields associated with it. If an observer measures a patch of space to be flat, then the strong equivalence principle suggests that it is absolutely equivalent to any other patch of flat space elsewhere in the universe. Einstein's theory of general relativity (including the [[cosmological constant]]) is thought to be the only theory of gravity that satisfies the strong equivalence principle. A number of alternative theories, such as [[Brans–Dicke theory]], satisfy only the Einstein equivalence principle.

====Tests of the strong equivalence principle====
The strong equivalence principle can be tested by searching for a variation of Newton's gravitational constant ''G'' over the life of the universe, or equivalently, variation in the masses of the fundamental particles. A number of independent constraints, from orbits in the solar system and studies of [[big bang nucleosynthesis]] have shown that ''G'' cannot have varied by more than 10%.

Thus, the strong equivalence principle can be tested by searching for [[fifth force]]s (deviations from the gravitational force-law predicted by general relativity). These experiments typically look for failures of the [[inverse-square law]] (specifically [[Yukawa potential|Yukawa forces]] or failures of [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]]) behavior of gravity in the laboratory. The most accurate tests over short distances have been performed by the Eöt–Wash group. A future satellite experiment, SEE (Satellite Energy Exchange), will search for fifth forces in space and should be able to further constrain violations of the strong equivalence principle. Other limits, looking for much longer-range forces, have been placed by searching for the [[Nordtvedt effect]], a "polarization" of solar system orbits that would be caused by gravitational self-energy accelerating at a different rate from normal matter. This effect has been sensitively tested by the [[Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment]]. Other tests include studying the deflection of radiation from [[astronomical radio source|distant radio sources]] by the sun, which can be accurately measured by [[very long baseline interferometry]]. Another sensitive test comes from measurements of the frequency shift of signals to and from the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] spacecraft. Together, these measurements have put tight limits on [[Brans–Dicke theory]] and other alternative theories of gravity.

In 2014, astronomers discovered a stellar triple system including a millisecond [[pulsar]] [[PSR J0337+1715]] and two [[white dwarf]]s orbiting it. The system provided them a chance to test the strong equivalence principle in a strong gravitational field with high accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12917.html#ref7 |title=A millisecond pulsar in a stellar triple system |first1=Scott M. |last1=Ransom |display-authors=etal |journal=Nature |year=2014 |accessdate=8 January 2014 |doi=10.1038/nature12917 |arxiv = 1401.0535 |bibcode = 2014Natur.505..520R |volume=505 |issue=7484 |pages=520–524 |pmid=24390352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Universality of free fall from the orbital motion of a pulsar in a stellar triple system|author=Anne M.

==Challenges==
One challenge to the equivalence principle is the [[Brans–Dicke theory]]. [[Self-creation cosmology]] is a modification of the Brans–Dicke theory. The [[Fredkin Finite Nature Hypothesis]] is an even more radical challenge to the equivalence principle and has even fewer supporters.

In August 2010, researchers from the University of New South Wales, Swinburne University of Technology, and Cambridge University published a paper titled "Evidence for spatial variation of the [[fine structure constant]]", whose tentative conclusion is that, "qualitatively, [the] results suggest a violation of the Einstein Equivalence Principle, and could infer a very large or infinite universe, within which our 'local' [[Hubble volume]] represents a tiny fraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1008.3907 |first1=John K. |last1=Webb |first2=Julian A. |last2=King |first3=Michael T. |last3=Murphy |first4=Victor V. |last4=Flambaum |first5=Robert F. |last5=Carswell |first6=Matthew B. |last6=Bainbridge |title=Evidence for spatial variation of the fine structure constant |year=2010 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.191101 |pmid=22181590 |volume=107 |issue=19 |pages=191101 |journal=Physical Review Letters |bibcode=2011PhRvL.107s1101W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Einstein's Mistakes'', pages 226–227, Hans C. Ohanian describes several situations which falsify Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Inertial accelerative effects are analogous to, but not equivalent to, gravitational effects.  Ohanian cites Ehrenfest for this same opinion.

==Explanations==
Dutch physicist and [[string theory|string theorist]] [[Erik Verlinde]] has generated a self-contained, logical derivation of the equivalence principle based on the starting assumption of a [[holographic universe]].  Given this situation, gravity would not be a true [[fundamental force]] as is currently thought but instead an "[[emergent property]]" related to [[entropy]].  Verlinde's [[entropic gravity]] theory apparently leads naturally to the correct observed strength of [[dark energy]]; previous failures to explain its incredibly small magnitude have been called by such people as cosmologist [[Michael Turner (cosmologist)|Michael Turner]] (who is credited as having coined the term "dark energy") as "the greatest embarrassment in the history of theoretical physics".&lt;ref name=Wright2001&gt;{{cite web |last=Wright |first=Karen |title=Very Dark Energy |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/mar/featdark#.USwYk6XmjoI |publisher=Discover Magazine |accessdate=26 February 2013 |date=1 March 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it should be noted that these ideas are far from settled and still very controversial.

"'''For Want of a Nail'''" is a [[proverb]], having numerous variations over several centuries, reminding that seemingly unimportant acts or omissions can have grave and unforeseen consequences.

== Analysis ==
{{quote box|border=1px|align=right|title=''"Knight" Variation''|quote=&lt;poem&gt;
For want of a nail the shoe was lost,
for want of a shoe the horse was lost,
for want of a horse the knight was lost,
for want of a knight the battle was lost,
for want of a battle the kingdom was lost.
So a kingdom was lost&amp;mdash;all for want of a nail.&lt;/poem&gt;|source=
''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' ''DC Comics, 1998''}}

The proverb has come down in many variations over the centuries. It describes a situation in which a failure to anticipate or correct some initially small dysfunction leads by successively more critical stages to an egregious outcome. The rhyme's implied small difference in initial conditions is the lack of a spare [[horseshoe]] [[Nail (fastener)|nail]], relative to a condition of its availability.&lt;ref name=everything.com/&gt; At a more literal level, it expresses the importance of [[military logistics]] in warfare.

Such chains of [[causality]] are perceived only in [[hindsight]]. No one ever lamented, upon seeing his unshod horse, that the kingdom would eventually fall because of it.&lt;ref name=everything.com&gt;[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1097943 For want of a nail @ Everything2.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Related sayings are is "A stitch, in time, saves nine" and "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure". A somewhat similar idea is referred to in the [[metaphor]] known as [[camel's nose|the camel's nose]].

The proverb is found in a number of forms, beginning as early as the 13th century:

*In British Columbia Saw-Mill Co. v. Nettleship (1868), L.R. 3 C.P. 499 (Eng. Q.B.), a variation on the story is given a legal flavour:
**"Cases of this kind have always been found to be very difficult to deal with, beginning with a case said to have been decided about two centuries and a half ago, where a man going to be married to an heiress, his horse having cast a shoe on the journey, employed a blacksmith to replace it, who did the work so unskilfully that the horse was lamed, and, the rider not arriving in time, the lady married another; and the blacksmith was held liable for the loss of the marriage. The question is a very serious one; and we should inevitably fall into a similar absurdity unless we applied the rules of common sense to restrict the extent of liability for the breach of contract of this sort."

Along with  the long history of the proverb listed above, it has continued to be referenced since the mid 20th century in modern culture.  Examples include:

=== Legal ===

*In his dissent in ''[[Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency]]'' (549 US 497, 2007), Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts]] of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] cites "all for the want of a horseshoe nail" as an example of a ''possible'' chain of causation.  He claimed that, by contrast, the threshold jurisdictional issue of standing requires a ''likely'' chain of causation, which was not satisfied by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]'s regulation of new automobile emissions to prevent the loss of Massachusetts coastal land due to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;''Massachusetts v. E.P.A.'', 549 U.S. 497, 546 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his dissent in ''[[CSX Transportation, Inc. v. McBride]]'', Roberts again invokes the proverb, explaining that, in [[tort|tort law]], the doctrine of [[proximate cause]] is meant to "limit[] liability at some point before the want of a nail leads to loss of the kingdom."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-235.pdf ''CSX Transportation, Inc. v.

Stephen King's 1987 novel, ''The Tommyknockers'' also references the proverb in its first line: "For want of a nail the kingdom was lost&amp;nbsp;– that's how the catechism goes when you boil it down."
*''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' is a three-issue comic book limited series published by [[DC Comics]] in 1998 about a world where the baby Kal-El was never found by [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Ma and Pa Kent]] because a nail punctured their truck tire on the day when they would have found his ship; thus the child does not grow up to become [[Superman]].  This story uses the English ("[[Knight]]") variation of the rhyme as a theme.
*''[[A Wind in the Door]]'' is a fantasy/science fiction novel by [[Madeleine L'Engle]] which was a sequel to ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]]''.

For the want of a shoe, they lost the horse. For the want of a horse, they lost the rider''" to justify the reason why he is taking with him four extra horseshoes.
* In the 1967 [[Mannix]] episode 'Turn Every Stone,' Joe Mannix alludes to the saying at  the end when he says, "It's the old horseshoe-nail bit again. For want of $10,000, a million was lost."
* In the 1954 movie ''[[The Caine Mutiny]]'', Captain Queeg ([[Bogart]]) refers to the proverb during the following conversation with Ensign Keith after he reprimanded him for failing to enforce the untucked shirt-tails rule.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33384">'''Free speech fights''' are struggles over free speech, and especially those struggles which involved the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and their attempts to gain awareness for labor issues by organizing workers and urging them to use their collective voice. During the World War I period in the United States, the IWW members (referred to as Wobblies), engaged in free speech fights over labor issues which were closely connected to the developing industrial world as well as the [[Socialist Party]]. The Wobblies, along with other radical groups, were often met with opposition (violent and otherwise) from local governments and especially business leaders, in their free speech fights.

The IWW organized transient workers (especially in cities in the American West) who worked in highly seasonal jobs—they met on the streets, discussed contemporary issues, and listened to speakers; at the time, it was a very popular method of organization. The events often ended with the police arresting them for participating in street meetings. The most notorious of all of the free speech fights was the [[San Diego free speech fight]], which won a significant amount of public awareness for the IWW as it involved tremendous violence against the labor groups organized by the IWW.&lt;ref&gt;Brisseden, p.283, and Whitten, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; which brought the IWW to the greater notice of the American public and was notable for the intensity of violence by anti-labor vigilantes directed at the IWW; this violence included the kidnapping and [[tarring and feathering]] of [[Ben Reitman]], who was a physician, and was [[Emma Goldman]]'s lover.

More generally, a '''free speech fight''' is any incident in which a group is involved in a conflict over its speech. For instance, the [[Free Speech Movement]], which began with a conflict on the [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley Campus]] in [[California]] in the 1960s, was a "free speech fight".

=="Free speech fights" and the IWW==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
The IWW engaged in free speech fights during the period from approximately 1907 to 1916. The ''Wobblies'', as the IWW members were called, relied upon [[Freedom of speech|free speech]], which in the United States is guaranteed by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], to enable them to communicate the concept of [[One Big Union (concept)|One Big Union]] to other workers. In communities where the authorities saw their interests in avoiding the development of unions, the practice of [[soapbox]]ing was frequently restricted by ordinance or by police harassment. The IWW [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics|employed a variety of creative tactics]], including the tactic of flooding the area of a free speech fight with ''footloose rebels'' who would challenge the authorities by flouting the ordinance, intentionally getting arrested in great numbers. With the jails full and a seemingly endless stream of union activists arriving by boxcar and highway, the local communities frequently rescinded their prohibitions on free speech, or came to some other accommodation.

[[The Free Speech League]], a progressive group which functioned at the same time as (and occasionally together with) the IWW, worked in conjunction with the IWW prior to World War I in many of their free speech fights, which generated a good deal of controversy. The free speech fights of the IWW were highly publicized, as they were designed to garner attention: they frequently started when local communities interjected to attempt to prevent the IWW from occupying street corners from which they would use provocative language to detail their radical beliefs.  The free speech fights began occurring in 1906 and drew to a close by 1917—over that period of time, at least 26 communities played host to the IWW's free speech fights, and the years of 1909 to 1913 were particularly active, with at least 21 free speech fights happening.

The IWW members who engaged in the free speech fights typically cited the [[First Amendment]] and the rights guaranteed therein as proof positive of the validity of their cause, thereby highlighting the legal importance of the issues they fought for. That being the case, their struggles did not go unanswered or ignored: local, state, and even the federal government were prompted to respond, while, perhaps more importantly, the American public, due to the national publicity garnered by the free speech fights, were invariably tasked with confronting free speech issues. Practically all realms of American life were impacted by the free speech fights, as members of the press, church officials, school teachers, politicians, anyone involved in the business and labor world, and members of any organization (especially those of the Socialist Party) had a stake in the fights and thus attempted to comment on the issues in contention.

===An overview of the free speech fights===
From its inception, the IWW was deeply committed to free speech issues, and especially those affiliated with labor groups. The IWW formed in 1905 in response to dissatisfaction with the trade unions promoted by the [[American Federation of Labor]] (the AFL).  Whereas the AFL promoted the ideals of capitalism by fighting for the rights of workers within the ideological framework of the free market system, the IWW functioned on anarchistic principles. Rather than urging workers to join unions based on craft and skill that were determined to form binding trade agreements with employers, the IWW advocated for the development of broad unions for low-skill workers that would be driven by the workers themselves (and their collective actions) rather than by top-down politics and binding capitalist decisions.

The primary vehicles of change for the free speech fights of the IWW were spontaneous workplace strikes as well as on-site labor slowdowns in addition to picketing, parades, and demonstrations. Importantly, the IWW engaged in street corner public displays and speaking to raise the public awareness regarding free speech fights. The desire for direct action by laborers was attributed to having grown disaffected with the beliefs of the AFL. They stressed their truly American origins and likened their actions to those of earlier American revolutionaries and activists.

The free speech fights of the IWW were often quite similar in nature: Wobblies (many of whom travelled across the country to spread their message) would visit a city's downtown and attempt to speak on soapboxes on street corners. Their message and their tactics were particularly provocative, and they were frequently arrested—though, if they were not arrested on one street corner, they would simply pack up and head to another one.  
Among the offences which they were arrested for were blocking traffic, vagrancy, unlawful assembly, or violating local ordinances such as ones against speaking on the streets.

Though the IWW was successful in many of their free speech fights, they did not always achieve their desired goals. In San Diego, for instance, they were unable to cause the repeal of a restrictive street ordinance while, in Paterson, they failed to gain protection for street picketing and meetings.

===The IWW ideology of free speech===
The ideology of the Wobblies who fought for free speech rights across America was deeply indebted to their core beliefs regarding the provenance of the First Amendment rights of the Constitution. In their estimation, they were fighting with the Constitution on their side while those who opposed them, such as city officials, were disregarding the fundamental laws of the country. The Wobblies frequently used phrases such as "Have you ever read the Constitution?" and "What is this, Czarist Russia, or Free America?"

The Wobblies held that the free speech rights granted by the First Amendment had been abridged over time, and they felt that it nowhere more evident than it was in the case of the laborers for whom they worked tirelessly—capitalism had conspired with the judicial system in the United States to deny agency and the Constitutionally-granted freedom of speech to American laborers. Not all Wobblies subscribed to such idealistic ideology, though, since some argued the more pessimistic belief that the Constitution had been written by the elites and that free speech was merely an illusion that worked to uphold the power of those same elites.
By adopting aggressive tactics which flaunted local ordinances against free speech, the Wobblies courted arrest, which they used as a demonstration of how far the abridgement of free speech had come. The official attempts to silence the IWW in the free speech fights, they argued, were totally opposed to the spirit of the First Amendment.

According to the Wobblies, the fact that they even had to fight for free speech rights was evidence of the corrupting effect of capitalism in America and of its legal system. They argued that the Constitution was not being applied to American laborers, just as it had not been applied to slaves in the century prior. Rather than take their fights to the courts, which they felt were substantially corrupted by capitalist influence, they took their fight to the streets and urged other Americans to do the same.

The publications of the IWW urged people to "Educate, Agitate, Organize!!!" which led their opponents to see the fights for free speech as precursors to more insidious desires such as those for unionization and, especially, for the abolition of capitalism.

===Popular reactions===
The free speech fights of the IWW were an inherently populist in nature. They were met with a variety of different public response and reactions: some supported their efforts and sought to collaborate with them while others engaged in vigilante violence against them (as was especially the case in San Diego). The free speech fights gained mass support from political groups such as labor unions, Socialists, and also the Free Speech League. Notably, few of the groups stood fast with the IWW when it came to their calls for revolution or for the overthrowing of capitalism more generally, and instead focused on the importance of the free speech rights for their own inherent worth to Americans. The AFL, though, opposed the IWW's efforts in the free speech realm from the get go. Other groups and members of the public, too, began to oppose the free speech fights over time because of the aggressive tactics and language among other things.

The Socialists were the most closely connected allies of the IWW in the free speech fights, as they had suffered through many years of free speech repression already and thus helped to fundraise for the cause and occasional even took part in the fights.

Labor unions also offered significant support to the free speech fight cause since they had a stake in the fights. Important support, still, came from the American public at large.

===Official reactions and regulation of street speaking===
The most notable proponent of the free speech fights in the official arena was New York City Police Commissioner Arthur Woods, who argued that all American groups should be granted the right of free speech and assembly. Rather than repress their constitutional rights, Woods felt that it was the duty of the police to protect the demonstrators. His personal philosophy dictated that free speech could be regulated only in ways that protected it through the creation of channels of expression which would not impede the rights of others.

The reasonable regulation of street speaking was an important issue that arose because of the free speech fights of the IWW. Their soapboxing on downtown street corners proved especially divisive. Whereas IWW supporters held that freedom of expression was especially important in the areas where that expression could actually reach the people (such as laborers) who would benefit the most from their message, opponents argued that their right to free speech did not belong in such public places where their incendiary tactics could be harmful to the public. Public streets were the best means of reaching the workers to whom their free speech fights were addressed, and the Wobblies did not always possess the necessary funds to rent out public assembly halls, for instance, from which they could exercise their right to free speech. 
The IWW conceded, nonetheless, that reasonable restrictions should be placed on public speaking.

The struggle over free speech on downtown street corners was regarded as absurd by many people, since there were myriad other areas in the public sphere that allowed outdoor speaking to take place—downtown street corners, though, were outlawed. The fight over the street corners, therefore, became a symbol of the divisive ideology of the IWW—their opponents scornfully argued that the street corners were important to the Wobblies only because they could not reach an audience elsewhere since nobody would willingly attend any of their speeches.

Many of the opponents of free speech fights, thus, were in favor of the establishment of centrally located areas that permitted oration but did not interfere with the city. Others, though, were totally opposed to the right to speak in public.

The IWW occasionally saw its fight over the regulation of street speaking extend to the judicial realm. More often than not, judges upheld the street ordinances that prevented public speaking. Notably, a judge in San Diego upheld the city's ordinance, and used the language of a similar decision in Los Angeles to explain that "This ordinance does not attempt to suppress freedom of speech, or seek to interfere with the citizen in the right to express his views upon any subject, political, religious, or otherwise, as is suggested by the petitioner. It simply specifies a certain district within the city wherein no one may do the things prohibited."

===Analysis of free speech themes===
One of the key themes of the free speech fights came from the regulation of speaking on the streets and involved discussions over the importance of access to public property and how reasonable limitations could be applied to it. People who debated the free speech fights frequently focused on the distinction between legal speech and illegal action while also detailing the various types of unprotected speech. They also debated what types of criticisms of the government should be protected by free speech.

One of the primary issues with the debates surrounding the free speech fights was that commentators understood that certain types of speech should be regarded as illegal and were not covered as free speech—sedition, libel, inciting speech, and obscenity fell into this category of speech, yet what some regarded as obscenity or libel, others regarded simply as government criticism that should be protected by the Constitution.

==Major IWW's free speech fights==

===Spokane free speech fight===

In ''A History of American Labor'', Joseph G. Rayback has written,

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The Industrial Workers of the World] made its first impression upon the nation through its involvement in the "free speech" fight begun in [[Spokane, Washington]], employment center for the casual labor elements of the Pacific Northwest. The fight developed late in 1908 when the I.W.W. launched an extensive speaking campaign with the slogan "Don't Buy Jobs" in the streets around the Spokane employment agencies which had become skilled in the art of swindling men who applied for jobs.&lt;ref name="Rayback-244"&gt;Rayback, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "job sharks" were so closely tied to the crew boss on many job sites that there would be "one gang coming, one gang working and one gang going." The faster the turnover, the greater the fees that could be generated. From time to time the men would ignore the IWW and seek revenge after an employment shark took someone's last dollar for a job that didn't exist. The ''Spokesman-Review'' of January 18, 1909 reported,&lt;ref name="ThompsonMurfin-47"&gt;Thompson and Murfin, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hurling rocks and chunks of ice through the windows of the Red Cross Employment Agency, 224 Stevens St., several members of a noisy mob of between 2,000 and 3,000 idle men were about to attempt to wreck the place about 6 o'clock last evening, when [[James H. Walsh]], organizer of the IWW, mounted a chair and pacified the multitude. In the opinion of the police had it not been for the intervention of Walsh, a riot would surely have followed, as the rabble was worked up to such a pitch that its members would have readily attempted violence. Walsh discouraged violence and summoned all members of the IWW to their hall at the rear of 312 Front Ave. The police dispersed the rest... At the hall Walsh warned the crowd against an outbreak. "There were a lot of hired [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkertons]] in that crowd," he said. "All they wanted you fellows to do was to start something and then they would have an excuse for shooting you down or smashing your heads in... You can gain nothing by resorting to mob rule."&lt;ref name="ThompsonMurfin-47-48"&gt;Thompson and Murfin, pp. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the rest of the summer, IWW street meetings brought more and more [[Wobbly lingo#Stiff|working stiffs]] into the IWW.&lt;ref name="ThompsonMurfin-48"&gt;Thompson and Murfin, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The agencies promptly countered by pressuring the city council to pass an ordinance forbidding street speaking. The I.W.W. obeyed the regulation for nearly a year, until Spokane religious groups, which habitually used the streets, secured a new regulation exempting them from the street-speaking ordinance. Angered by the discrimination on behalf of "the Christers," the Spokane I.W.W. renewed its campaign.&lt;ref name="Rayback-244" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The newspaper of the IWW, the ''[[Industrial Worker]]'', published the following on October 28: "Wanted&amp;mdash;Men to Fill the Jails of Spokane." Then the IWW sent out a notice to all locations, "Nov. 2, FREE SPEECH DAY&amp;mdash;IWW locals will be notified by wire how many men to send if any... Meetings will be orderly and no irregularities of any kind will be tolerated."&lt;ref name="ThompsonMurfin-48" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In one day 150 men were arrested and crowded into jails that could hardly accommodate them. Reinforcements promptly arrived from the surrounding territory.&lt;ref name="Rayback-244" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Spokane City Council arranged for rock-pile work for the prisoners.&lt;ref name="ThompsonMurfin-48" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the end of twenty days four hundred men had been jailed.&lt;ref name="Rayback-244" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Overflowing prisoners were lodged in the Franklin School [then located along Front Street (now Trent)], and the War Department made Fort Wright available for more. Eight editors in succession got out a copy of the ''Industrial Worker'', and then took their turn soapboxing, and went to jail. The IWW's "rebel girl," [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], who was fresh out of high school, delayed her arrest by chaining herself to a lamppost. She later charged that the police were using the women's section of the jail as a brothel, with police soliciting customers. When that story was printed in the ''Industrial Worker'' on December 10, the police attempted to destroy all copies. Public sympathy began to favor the strikers. When the prison guards would march the overflowing prisoners through the streets to bathing facilities, crowds would shower the men with apples, oranges, and Cigarettes.&lt;ref name="ThompsonMurfin-49"&gt;Thompson and Murfin, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The effort brought results: the [[Western Federation of Miners|W.F.M.]] declared a boycott of all goods coming from Spokane, and taxpayers began to protest against the cost of feeding, housing, and policing the prisoners. When [[Vincent Saint John|Vincent St. John]] publicly appealed to all Wobblies to come to Spokane to renew the struggle, city officials capitulated.&lt;ref name="Rayback-244" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The victory for the free speech fight came on March 4. The licenses of 19 of the employment agencies were revoked.&lt;ref name="ThompsonMurfin-49" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The I.W.W. was granted freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, and the right to distribute its literature.&lt;ref name="Rayback-244" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Labor's Untold Story'', Boyer and Morais observed,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The courts became so clogged they could handle little else but free speech cases. The fight for free speech became largely a question of endurance between the lungs and heads of the Wobblies and the stamina of the police. In [[Missoula, Montana|Missoula]] and Spokane as in most of the other towns where free speech fights were waged, any citizen could address any assemblage on any street on any subject at any time by the end of 1912.&lt;ref name="BoyerMorais-174"&gt;Boyer and Morais, p.174.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Missoula free speech fight===

[[File:Elizabeth Gurley Flynn point.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], firebrand soapboxer of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]]]

The IWW members won a free speech fight in Missoula when, on October 8, 1909, the city council decided to let the union members speak anywhere in the community, so long as they did not impede traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Article, "Missoula witness to history of Industrial Workers of the World", ''Missoulian'', http://www.missoulian.com/news/local/article_a80ba83e-9b67-11de-942e-001cc4c002e0.html Sunday, September 6, 2009, retrieved Sunday, September 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]] was "a striking auburn-haired 19-year-old" when she arrived in Missoula with her husband, Jack Jones in September 1909. At Higgins Avenue and West Front Street, the Wobblies set up a soapbox. On September 22, [[Frank Little (unionist)|Frank Little]] arrived to assist. Little and Jones were arrested on September 29. A young logger and a civil engineer then spoke, and were likewise arrested. Flynn put out the word, declaring, "we need volunteers to go to jail." Wobblies poured in from the surrounding territory, flooding the jail. They sang IWW songs, and shouted Wobbly slogans.&lt;ref name="missoulian.com"&gt;Article, "Missoula witness to history of Industrial Workers of the World", ''Missoulian'', http://www.missoulian.com/news/local/article_a80ba83e-9b67-11de-942e-001cc4c002e0.html Sunday, September 6, 2009, retrieved Friday, April 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Flynn, who also was arrested, the jail was "a filthy, dirty hole under the firehouse stable, where all the filthy excrement of the place pours down upon the prisoners." Yet enough Wobblies submitted themselves to arrest—frequently just before dinner time—that the city was feeling the impact of the Wobbly tactic.&lt;ref name="missoulian.com"/&gt; After a night in jail, Wobblies were often offered their freedom before breakfast, but many refused to be released, instead demanding a jury trial.&lt;ref name="missoulian.com"/&gt;

The Western Montana Apple Show was set to open, and Missoula officials decided to "wave a white flag." The IWW had won the Missoula free speech fight, and all charges were dropped.&lt;ref name="missoulian.com"/&gt;

On February 7, 2011, the [[National Park Service]] officially recognized Free Speech Corner at Higgens Avenue and West Front Street, adding it to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] to commemorate the Missoula free speech fight.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Briggeman, ''Missoulian'', "Missoula downtown historic district expands" http://missoulian.com/news/local/article_48d77b24-7084-11e0-a541-001cc4c002e0.html published April 27, 2011, retrieved April 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Diego free speech fight===

The [[San Diego free speech fight|free speech fight in San Diego]] from 1912 to 1913 was among the most prominent free speech fights of the IWW. An ordinance had been passed by the San Diego Common Council which made it much more difficult for the Wobblies to engage in their soapbox orations without being swiftly arrested. The San Diego jails were soon teeming with Wobblies and others who used civil disobedience in the fight for free speech, and, even more alarmingly, contingents of vigilantes arose to fight against those in favor of free speech. The Free Speech League worked in concert with the IWW in San Diego, but, when the fight became judicial, the ordinance was upheld.

===Sioux City, Iowa===

Sioux City was considered a very strategic town for workers to stage free speech fights in because it was "a gateway for laborers entering and leaving summer employment in agriculture and construction in the Dakotas."  Since those employment opportunities for the workers were seasonal, many of them returned to spend the winter in Sioux City, where the Wobblies attempted to provide them incentives to join their Free Speech Fight such as by educating them and helping feed them over the tough winter. 

Over a thousand men were unemployed in Sioux City at the time during the winter of 1915. There had been a real push to get workers to come to Sioux City by business leaders there, but workers who arrived found that there were barely enough jobs for the local laborers. 
On the 15th of January, after facing even harsher conditions and struggling with unemployment, roughly 150 of the IWW-associated unemployed stormed the Commercial Club where many business leaders listened to them demand work and watched them take food. 

In response to the direct action of the IWW, Sioux City increased enforcement of vagrancy laws and began arresting more of the IWW members engaged in the Free Speech Fights. Their goal in doing so was to attempt to drive the IWW out of town, but, unsurprisingly, they achieved the opposite. The IWW demanded free speech rights to be granted in the city. They Wobblies were filling the city's jails and forced the hand of the city officials to attempt to strike a deal with them. Ultimately, they won the fight and free speech rights were granted to workers in Sioux City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indispensable Outcasts: Hobo Workers and Community in the American Midwest, 1880-1930|last=Higbie|first=Frank|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-252-07098-3|location=Urbana|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other free speech fights of the IWW===

The IWW followed with other free speech fights in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; in [[Aberdeen, Washington|Aberdeen]] and [[Wenatchee, Washington]]; and in [[Fresno, California]].&lt;ref name="Hobo Orator Union"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D |last=May |first=Matthew S. |title=Hobo Orator Union: The Free Speech Fights of the Industrial Workers of the World, 1909-1916 |date=July 2009 |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] |url=http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/53722/1/May_umn_0130E_10548.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tarring and feathering|Tar and feathers]], beatings, clubbings, and forcible deportations were used in addition to incarceration. The San Diego free speech fight was unique in that the IWW did not have a specific organizing campaign at stake. The IWW won all of these free speech fights.&lt;ref name="Rayback-244" /&gt;

In early 1913, IWW members in [[Denver, Colorado]] fought [[History of Denver, Colorado#Labor unions|a lengthy free speech fight]]. Denver authorities had refused to allow the Wobblies to speak on street corners, so union members filled the jails for months. The union won the right to speak to workers, and within a year had formed two Denver branches.&lt;ref name="Brundage-161-162"&gt;Brundage, pp.161-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other locations of free speech fights by the IWW included [[Duluth, Minnesota]]; [[Portland, Oregon]]; [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="BoyerMorais-174" /&gt;

===The IWW's provocative free speech message===

The IWW message was particularly unpopular with the business community. IWW members believed that the capitalist system was corrupt, could not be reformed, and could only be resisted until a better society could be built for all working people. James Walsh's streetcorner speeches were therefore frequently disrupted, particularly by the local Volunteers of America and Salvation Army Bands.

Walsh recruited volunteers to put together a small band, equipped with "a big booming bass drum," in order to get the IWW's message to listeners. The group practiced patriotic and religious tunes of the period, but the Wobblies wrote new words to the songs.&lt;ref name="Blecha"&gt;Blecha, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"To grab the crowd's attention," the IWW band often "hid in a doorway while one member dressed in a bowler hat and carrying a briefcase and umbrella, yelled to the crowd, 'Help! I've been robbed!' The crowd rushed over only to hear, 'I've been robbed by the capitalist system! Fellow workers ...' He then launched into a short speech, and the makeshift band stepped out of the doorway and played their songs."
&lt;ref name="Blecha-Allen"&gt;Blecha, 2006, citing Linda Allen, ''Washington Songs and Lore'' (Spokane: Melior Publications 1988), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The soapbox tradition===
Prior to television, radio, and film becoming parts of American mass culture, public speaking was a primary medium for entertainment and information. Politicians, religious zealots, and newsboys all pitched their trade on the [[soapbox]]. Though not all street speakers were political, soapbox oration was fundamentally a political act. 

With the march of time of the 20th century, police forces and city ordinances began to take away the rights of soapbox orators. As television and radio became more prominent, the very act of street speaking began to seem antiquated and, at the very least, irrelevant. Street speaking represented a threat to upper- and middle-class white Americans who feared that "inter-ethnoracial, working-class political coalitions" would achieve influence through the soap box. 

This was especially true in Los Angeles, where class politics was reaching a fever pitch in the early 20th century. A multitude of political groups, such as the IWW, the Socialists, the Communist Party, and the Partido Liberal Mexicano all spoke out for Angelinos to fight for the rights of the underprivileged.

===Socialist free speech fights: 1900–1911===
In the early 20th century, it was the Socialist Party that led the charge in soapbox oration. They were the first group to make effective use of the tactics of public speaking. Over the first ten years of the city, they grew enough to gain significant political clout. In Los Angeles, the party drew in skilled and semi-skilled white workers who worried about their job security. Additionally, they attempted to recruit central Angelinos from more diverse ethnic backgrounds. In this way, Free Speech Fights in Los Angeles served as the battleground between central Los Angeles workers and the rest of the city.

===The World War I crackdown===
In the 1910s and 1920s, street speaking in Los Angeles suffered from increasing escalation of tactics by the LAPD and city ordinances. The Wobblies became the more dominant social group after the Socialists lost power, but the IWW was unable to draw nearly as many people to their soapbox speeches.

The IWW had a major conflict with the police over public speaking in San Pedro, a harbor community. They organized with striking dockworkers, but were met with extreme repression by the police who even used violent tactics to prevent their protests from being successful.  Because of the failures in San Pedro, the IWW lost power in Southern California.

'''Freedom of information''' is an extension of [[freedom of speech]], a fundamental [[human right]] recognized in [[international human rights law|international law]], which is today understood more generally  as [[freedom of expression]] in any medium, be it orally, in writing, print, through the [[Internet]] or through art forms.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} This means that the protection of freedom of speech as a right includes not only the content, but also the means of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Puddephatt, Freedom of Expression, The essentials of Human Rights, Hodder Arnold, 2005, pg.128&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of information also refers to the [[right to privacy]] in the content of the [[Internet]] and [[information technology]]. As with the right to freedom of expression, the [[right to privacy]] is a recognised [[human right]] and freedom of information acts as an extension to this right.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://freenetproject.org/papers/freenet-ieee.pdf Protecting Free Expression Online with Freenet - Internet Computing, IEEE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, freedom of information can include [[criticism of patents|opposition to patents]], [[Criticism of copyright|opposition to copyrights]] or [[criticism of intellectual property|opposition to intellectual property]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://somerandomnerd.com/node/647|title=Freedom of Information vs. Protection of Intellectual Property}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pirate Parties International|international]] and [[United States Pirate Party]] have established political platforms based largely on freedom of information issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Avast Network, What is the Pirate Party—and why is it helping Wikileaks?|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/world/81963/pirate-party-wikileaks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In law==
In June 2006 nearly 70 countries had freedom of information legislations applying to information held by government bodies and in certain circumstances to private bodies. In 19 of these countries the freedom of information legislation also applied to private bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=211 &amp; 223|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to information was increasingly recognised as a prerequisite for transparency and accountability of governments, as facilitating consumers' ability to make informed choices, and as safeguarding citizens against mismanagement and corruption. This has led an increasing number of countries to enact freedom of information legislation in the past 10 years.&lt;ref name="Mazhar Siraj 2010 213"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=213|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, private bodies have started to perform functions which were previously carried out by public bodies. Privatisation and de-regulation saw banks, telecommunications companies, hospitals and universities being run by private entities, leading to demands for the extension of freedom of information legislation to cover private bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=222|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government bodies ===
As of 2006, 70 countries had comprehensive freedom of information legislation for public bodies, nearly half of which had been enacted in the past 10 years. Such legislation was pending in a further 50 countries.&lt;ref name="Mazhar Siraj 2010 213"/&gt;

=== Private bodies ===
As of 2006, the following 19 countries had freedom of information legislation that extended to government bodies and private bodies: [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Angola]], [[Armenia]], [[Colombia]], the [[Czech Republic]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Panama]], [[Poland]], [[Peru]], [[South Africa]], [[Turkey]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Slovakia]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. The degree to which private bodies are covered under freedom of information legislation varies, in Angola, Armenia and Peru the legislation only applies to private companies that perform what are considered to be public functions. In the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Finland, Trinidad and Tobago, Slovakia, Poland and Iceland private bodies that receive public funding are subject to freedom of information legislation. Freedom of information legislation in Estonia, France and UK covers private bodies in certain sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=223|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa the access provisions of the Promotion of Access to Information Act have been used by individuals to establish why their loan application has been denied. The access provisions have also been used by minority shareholders in private companies and environmental groups, who were seeking information on the potential environmental damage caused by company projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=223–224|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consumer protection ====
In 1983 the [[United Nations Commission on Transnational Corporations]] adopted the [[United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection]] stipulating eight consumer rights, including "consumer access to adequate information to enable making informed choices according to individual wishes and needs". Access to information became regarded as a basic consumer right, and preventive disclosure, i.e. the disclosure of information on threats to human lives, health and safety, began to be emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=[[Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences]]|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=216|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Investors ====
Secretive decision making by company directors and corporate scandal led to freedom of information legislation to be published for the benefits of investors. Such legislation was first adopted in Britain in the early 20th century, and later in North America and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=216–217|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disclosure regimes for the benefit of investors regained attention at the beginning of the 21st century as a number of corporate scandals were linked to accounting fraud and company director secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=219|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with Enron, the subsequent scandals involving [[Worldcom]], [[Tyco International|Tyco]], [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia]] and [[Global Crossing]] prompted the [[US Congress]] to impose new information disclosure obligations on companies with the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=220|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet and information technology==
Freedom of information (or information freedom) also refers to the protection of the right to [[freedom of expression]] with regard to the [[Internet]] and [[information technology]]. Freedom of information may also concern [[censorship]] in an information technology context, i.e. the ability to access [[Web content]], without [[censorship]] or [[digital rights|restrictions]].

=== The Information Society and freedom of expression ===
The [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 reaffirms [[democracy]] and the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all [[human rights]] and fundamental freedoms. The Declaration also makes specific reference to the importance of the right to [[freedom of expression]] for the "[[information society|Information Society]]" in stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the [[information society|Information Society]], and as outlined in Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], that everyone has the right to [[Freedom of speech|freedom of opinion and expression]]; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits the Information Society offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Klang | first1 = Mathias| last2 = Murray| first2 = Andrew| title = Human Rights in the Digital Age | year = 2005| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=USksfqPjwhUC&amp;dq=%22digital+rights%22+human+rights&amp;cad=0| publisher = Routledge |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2004 WSIS Declaration of Principles also acknowledged that "it is necessary to prevent the use of information resources and technologies for criminal and terrorist purposes, while respecting human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Klang | first1 = Mathias| last2 = Murray| first2 = Andrew| title = Human Rights in the Digital Age | year = 2005| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=USksfqPjwhUC&amp;dq=%22digital+rights%22+human+rights&amp;cad=0| publisher = Routledge |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfgang Benedek comments that the WSIS Declaration only contains a number of references to human rights and does not spell out any procedures or mechanism to assure that human rights are considered in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Internet Governance and the Information Society |last=Benedek |first=Wolfgang |author2=Veronika  Bauer |author3=Matthias Kettemann  |year=2008 |publisher= Eleven International Publishing |location= |isbn=90-77596-56-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ie7Yqiw85TcC&amp;vq=%22Internet+Bill+of+rights%22&amp;dq=%22digital+rights%22+%22human+rights%22&amp;cad=0 |page=36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hacktivismo ===
{{main|Hacktivismo}}
The [[digital rights]] group [[Hacktivismo]], founded in 1999, argues that access to information is a basic [[human right]]. The group's beliefs are described fully in the "Hacktivismo Declaration" which calls for the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) to be applied to the [[Internet]]. The Declaration recalls the duty of member states to the ICCPR to protect the right to [[freedom of expression]] with regard to the internet and in this context freedom of information.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_files/declaration.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Hacktivismo Declaration recognises "the importance to fight against human rights abuses with respect to reasonable access to information on the Internet" and calls upon the [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] community to "study ways and means of circumventing state sponsored [[censorship]] of the internet" and "implement technologies to challenge information rights violations". The Hacktivismo Declaration does, however, recognise that the right to [[freedom of expression]] is subject to limitations, stating "we recognised the right of governments to forbid the publication of properly categorized [[state secrets]], [[child pornography]], and matters related to personal [[privacy]] and [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]], among other accepted restrictions." However, the Hacktivismo Declaration states "but we oppose the use of state power to control access to the works of critics, [[intellectuals]], [[artists]], or religious figures."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Global Network Initiative ===
On October 29, 2008 the [[Global Network Initiative]] (GNI) was founded upon its "Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy". The Initiative was launched in the 60th Anniversary year of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and is based on internationally recognized laws and standards for [[human rights]] on [[freedom of expression]] and [[privacy]] set out in the UDHR, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php Global Network Initiative, FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309234331/http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php |date=2009-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in the Initiative include the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], other major companies, human rights NGOs, investors, and academics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/10/29/global20097.htm Internet Rights Protection Initiative Launches]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/participants/index.php Global Network Initiative, Participants]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to reports [[Cisco Systems]] was invited to the initial discussions but didn't take part in the initiative. [[Harrington Investments]], which proposed that Cisco establish a human rights board, has dismissed the GNI as a voluntary code of conduct not having any impact. Chief executive John Harrington called the GNI "meaningless noise" and instead calls for bylaws to be introduced that force boards of directors to accept human rights responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Glanville"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/17/censorship-internet |title=The big business of net censorship |last=Glanville  |first=Jo |date=17 November 2008 |publisher= The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet censorship ===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Internet police officer chacha.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Internet [[police officer]] [[Jingjing and Chacha|Chacha]], one of the [[cartoon]] [[mascots]] of the Internet Surveillance Division of the Public Security Bureau in [[Shenzhen]], [[China]].]] --&gt;
{{main|Internet censorship}}
Jo Glanville, editor of the [[Index on Censorship]], states that "the internet has been a revolution for censorship as much as for free speech".&lt;ref name="Glanville"/&gt; The concept of freedom of information has emerged in response to state sponsored censorship, monitoring and surveillance of the internet. Internet censorship includes the control or suppression of the publishing or accessing of information on the [[Internet]].
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Iran Web screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|A screenshot of a blocked website in Iran.]] --&gt;

According to the [[Reporters without Borders]] (RSF) "internet enemy list" the following states engage in pervasive internet censorship: [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[Maldives]], [[Myanmar]]/[[Burma]], [[North Korea]], [[Syria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=19603 List of the 13 Internet enemies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102000000/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=19603 |date=January 2, 2008 }} RSF, 2006 November&lt;/ref&gt; A widely publicised example is the so-called "[[Great Firewall of China]]" (in reference both to its role as a [[firewall (networking)|network firewall]] and to the ancient [[Great Wall of China]]). The system blocks content by preventing [[IP address]]es from being routed through and consists of standard firewall and [[proxy server]]s at the [[Internet]] [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]]s. The system also selectively engages in [[DNS poisoning]] when particular sites are requested.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9522">'''Freiling's axiom of symmetry (''AX'')''' is a [[set theory|set-theoretic]] axiom proposed by [[Chris Freiling]].  It is based on intuition of Stuart Davidson
but the mathematics behind it goes back to [[Wacław Sierpiński]].

Let ''A'' be the set of functions mapping real numbers in the unit interval [0,1] to countable subsets of the same interval.  The axiom ''AX'' states:

:For every ''f'' in ''A'', there exist ''x'' and ''y'' such that ''x'' is not in ''f''(''y'') and ''y'' is not in ''f''(''x'').

A theorem of Sierpiński says that under the assumptions of ZFC set theory,
''AX'' is equivalent to the negation of the [[continuum hypothesis]] (CH). Sierpiński's theorem answered a question of [[Hugo Steinhaus]] and was proved long before the independence of CH had been established by
[[Kurt Gödel]] and [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]].

Freiling claims that probabilistic intuition strongly supports this proposition
while others disagree.  There are several versions of the axiom, some of which
are discussed below.

==Freiling's argument==

Fix a function ''f'' in ''A''.  We will consider a thought experiment that involves throwing two darts at the unit interval.  We aren't able to physically determine with infinite accuracy the actual values of the numbers ''x'' and ''y'' that are hit.  Likewise, the question of whether "''y'' is in ''f''(''x'')" cannot actually be physically computed. Nevertheless, if ''f'' really ''is'' a function, then this question is a meaningful one and will have a definite "yes" or "no" answer.

Now wait until after the first dart, ''x'', is thrown and then assess the chances that the second dart ''y'' will be in ''f''(''x'').  Since ''x'' is now fixed, ''f''(''x'') is a fixed countable set and has [[Lebesgue measure]] zero. Therefore, this event, with ''x'' fixed, has probability zero.  Freiling now makes two generalizations:

* Since we can predict with virtual certainty that "''y'' is not in ''f''(''x'')" after the first dart is thrown, and since this prediction is valid no matter what the first dart does, we should be able to make this prediction before the first dart is thrown.  This is not to say that we still have a measurable event, rather it is an intuition about the nature of being predictable.
* Since "''y'' is not in ''f''(''x'')" is predictably true, by the symmetry of the order in which the darts were thrown (hence the name "axiom of symmetry") we should also be able to predict with virtual certainty that "''x'' is not in ''f''(''y'')".

The axiom ''AX'' is now justified based on the principle that what will predictably happen every time this experiment is performed, should at the very least be possible.  Hence there should exist two real numbers ''x'', ''y'' such that ''x'' is not in ''f''(''y'') and ''y'' is not in ''f''(''x'').

==Relation to the (Generalised) Continuum Hypothesis==
Fix &lt;math&gt;\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt; an infinite cardinal (''e.g.'' &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{0}\,&lt;/math&gt;). Let &lt;math&gt;\texttt{AX}_{\kappa}.\,&lt;/math&gt; be the statement: ''there is no map &lt;math&gt;f:\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\to\mathcal{P}\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt; from sets to sets of size &lt;math&gt;\leq\kappa&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;(\forall{x,y\in\mathcal{P}(\kappa)})\,&lt;/math&gt; either &lt;math&gt;x\in f(y)\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y\in f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''Claim:''' &lt;math&gt;\texttt{ZFC}\vdash 2^{\kappa}=\kappa^{+}\leftrightarrow\neg\texttt{AX}_{\kappa}.\,&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof:'''
''Part I'' (&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow\,&lt;/math&gt;):

Suppose &lt;math&gt;2^{\kappa}=\kappa^{+}\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then letting &lt;math&gt;\sigma:\kappa^{+}\to\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt; a bijection, we have &lt;math&gt;f:\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\to\mathcal{P}\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;:\sigma(\alpha)\mapsto \{\sigma(\beta):\beta\preceq\alpha\}\,&lt;/math&gt; clearly demonstrates the failure of Freiling's axiom.

''Part II'' (&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow\,&lt;/math&gt;):

Suppose that Freiling's axiom fails. Then fix some &lt;math&gt;f\,&lt;/math&gt; to verify this fact. Define an order relation on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;A\leq_{f} B&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;A\in f(B)&lt;/math&gt;. This relation is total and every point has &lt;math&gt;\leq\kappa&lt;/math&gt; many predecessors. Define now a strictly increasing chain &lt;math&gt;(A_{\alpha}\in\mathcal{P}(\kappa))_{\alpha&lt;\kappa^{+}}&lt;/math&gt; as follows: at each stage choose &lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha}\in\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\setminus\bigcup_{\xi&lt;\alpha}f(A_{\xi})&lt;/math&gt;. This process can be carried out since for every ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;\kappa^{+}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{\xi&lt;\alpha}f(A_{\xi})\,&lt;/math&gt; is a union of &lt;math&gt;\leq\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt; many sets of size &lt;math&gt;\leq\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt;; thus is of size &lt;math&gt;\leq\kappa&lt;2^{\kappa}\,&lt;/math&gt; and so is a strict subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt;. We also have that this sequence is ''cofinal'' in the order defined, ''i.e.'' every member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\leq_{f}\,&lt;/math&gt; some &lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha}\,&lt;/math&gt;. (For otherwise if &lt;math&gt;B\in\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt; is not &lt;math&gt;\leq_{f}\,&lt;/math&gt; some &lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, then since the order is total &lt;math&gt;(\forall{\alpha&lt;\kappa^{+}})A_{\alpha}\leq_{f} B\,&lt;/math&gt;; implying &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;\geq\kappa^{+}&gt;\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt; many predecessors; a contradiction.) Thus we may well-define a map &lt;math&gt;g:\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\to\kappa^{+}\,&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;B\mapsto\operatorname{min}\{\alpha&lt;\kappa^{+}:B\in f(A_{\alpha})\}&lt;/math&gt;.
So &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\kappa)=\bigcup_{\alpha&lt;\kappa^{+}}g^{-1}\{\alpha\}=\bigcup_{\alpha&lt;\kappa^{+}}f(A_{\alpha})\,&lt;/math&gt; which is union of &lt;math&gt;\kappa^{+}\,&lt;/math&gt; many sets each of size &lt;math&gt;\leq\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;2^{\kappa}\leq\kappa^{+}\cdot\kappa=\kappa^{+}\,&lt;/math&gt; and we are done.
{{NumBlk|1=|2=|3=&lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt; (Claim)|RawN=.}}

Note that &lt;math&gt;|[0,1]|=|\mathcal{P}(\aleph_{0})|\,&lt;/math&gt; so we can easily rearrange things to obtain that &lt;math&gt;\neg\texttt{CH}\Leftrightarrow\,&lt;/math&gt; the above-mentioned form of Freiling's axiom.

The above can be made more precise: &lt;math&gt;\texttt{ZF}\vdash(\texttt{AC}_{\mathcal{P}(\kappa)}+\neg\texttt{AX}_{\kappa})\leftrightarrow \texttt{CH}_{\kappa}\,&lt;/math&gt;. This shows (together with the fact that the continuum hypothesis is independent of choice) a precise way in which the (generalised) continuum hypothesis is an extension of the axiom of choice.

==Objections to Freiling's argument==

Freiling's argument is not widely accepted because of the following two problems with it (which Freiling was well aware of and discussed in his paper).

* The naive probabilistic intuition used by Freiling [[tacit assumption|tacitly assumes]] that there is a well-behaved way to associate a probability to any subset of the reals.  But the mathematical formalization of the notion of "[[probability]]" uses the notion of [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]], yet the axiom of choice implies the existence of non-measurable subsets, even of the unit interval.  Some examples of this are the  [[Banach–Tarski paradox]] and the existence of [[Vitali set]]s.
*A minor variation of his argument gives a contradiction with the axiom of choice  whether or not one accepts the continuum hypothesis, if one replaces countable additivity of probability by additivity for cardinals less than the continuum. (Freiling used a similar argument to claim that [[Martin's axiom]] is false.) It is not clear why Freiling's intuition should be any less applicable in this instance, if it applies at all. {{harv|Maddy|1988|p=500}} So Freiling's argument seems to be more an argument against the possibility of well ordering the reals than against the continuum hypothesis.

==Connection to graph theory==
Using the fact that in ZFC, we have &lt;math&gt;2^{\kappa}=\kappa^{+}\Leftrightarrow\neg\texttt{AX}_{\kappa}\,&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Freiling's axiom of symmetry#Relation to the (Generalised) Continuum Hypothesis|above]]), it is not hard to see that the ''failure'' of the axiom of symmetry&amp;nbsp;— and thus the success of &lt;math&gt;2^{\kappa}=\kappa^{+}\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;— is equivalent to the following combinatorial principle for graphs:

:* The [[complete graph]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\,&lt;/math&gt; can be so directed, that every node leads to at most &lt;math&gt;\kappa\,&lt;/math&gt;-many nodes.
:* In the case of &lt;math&gt;\kappa=\aleph_{0}\,&lt;/math&gt;, this translates to: The complete graph on the unit circle can be so directed, that every node leads to at most countably-many nodes.

Thus in the context of ZFC, the failure of a Freiling axiom is equivalent to the existence of a specific kind of choice function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6711">'''Hongaku''' ({{cjkv|c=本覺|p=běnjué|rr=bongak}}) is an [[East Asian Buddhism|East Asian Buddhist doctrine]] often translated as "inherent", "innate", "intrinsic" or "original" [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] and is the view that all sentient beings already are enlightened or awakened in some way. It is closely tied with the concept of [[Buddha-nature]].

==Origins and development==
The doctrine of innate enlightenment was developed in China out of the Buddha-nature doctrine. It is first mentioned in the [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]] scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Sueki Fumihiko, "Two Seemingly Contradictory Aspects of the Teaching of Innate Enlightenment (hongaku) in Medieval Japan", Japanese Journal of Religious Study 22 (1-2), pp. 3-16, 1995. [https://web.archive.org/web/20131112093012/http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MAG/mag32125.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacqueline Stone, The awakening of faith in the Mahayana sees original enlightenment as "true [[tathātā|suchness]] considered under the aspect of conventional deluded consciousness and thus denotes the potential for enlightenment in unenlightened beings."&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=Jacqueline|title=Medieval Tendai hongaku thought and the new Kamakura Buddhism: A reconsideration|journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies|date=1 May 1995|volume=22|issue=1-2|url=https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2559|doi=10.18874/jjrs.22.1-2.1995.17-48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval China, the doctrine developed from the [[Huayan]] school and also influenced [[Chan Buddhism]].

The doctrine is also a common theme of the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'' of [[Huineng]] and was taught by Chinese Chan masters as "seeing original nature". Inherent enlightenment was often associated with the teachings of [[subitism| sudden enlightenment]] and contrasted with the "gradual" approach and the idea of “acquired enlightenment” or ''shikaku''. The first Japanese to write of this doctrine was [[Kūkai]] (774–835), founder of [[Shingon Buddhism]].

==In Japanese Buddhism==
The doctrine of innate enlightenment was very influential in [[Tendai]] from the [[cloistered rule]] era (1086–1185) through the [[Edo period]] (1688–1735).&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt; The Tendai view of hongaku saw it as encompassing not only all sentient beings, but all living things and all nature, even inanimate objects - all were considered to be Buddha. This also includes all our actions and thoughts, even our deluded thoughts, as expressions of our innately enlightened nature.&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt;

Tamura Yoshirõ (1921–1989) saw original {{Nihongo|enlightenment thought|本覺思想|hongaku shisō}} as being defined by two major philosophical elements.&lt;ref&gt; Tamura Yoshirō (1987), Japanese culture and the Tendai concept of original enlightenment, Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 14 (2-3), 203-205 [https://web.archive.org/web/20131229102232/http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2355 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; One was a radical non-dualism, in which everything was seen as empty and interconnected, so that the differences between ordinary person and Buddha and all other distinctions, were ontologically negated. The other feature of hongaku was the affirmation of the phenomenal world as an expression of the nondual realm of Buddha nature. This was expressed in phrases such as “the worldly passions are precisely enlightenment” and “birth and death are precisely nirvana.”&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt;

The Tendai doctrine of hongaku had deep impact on the development of [[Kamakura period#Flourishing of Buddhism|New Kamakura Buddhism]], for many of those who founded new Kamakura Buddhist schools (Eisai, Honen, Shinran, Dogen and Nichiren) studied Tendai at [[Mount Hiei]].&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt;

During the 1980s a Japanese movement known as [[Critical Buddhism]] has attacked original enlightenment as an ideology that supports the status quo and legitimates social injustice by accepting all things as they are as expressions of original Buddha nature.

'''Hospitality''' refers to the relationship between a guest and a host, wherein the host receives the guest with goodwill, including the reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers. Louis, chevalier de Jaucourt describes hospitality in the Encyclopédie as the virtue of a great soul that cares for the whole universe through the ties of humanity.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"&gt;Jaucourt, Louis, chevalier de.

'''Hospitality ethics''' is a discipline that studies this usage of hospitality.

==Etymology ==
Derives from the Latin ''hospes'',&lt;ref&gt;C. Lewis, Elementary Latin Dictionary (Oxford Univ. Press, 2000), p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "host", "guest", or "stranger". ''Hospes'' is formed from ''hostis'', which means "stranger" or "enemy" (the latter being where terms like "hostile" derive). By [[metonymy]] the Latin word 'Hospital' means a guest-chamber, guest's lodging, an inn.&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary, revised by Marchant, J &amp; Charles J., 260th. Thousand&lt;/ref&gt; Hospes/hostis is thus the root for the English words [[Wikt:host|host]], hospitality, hospice, hostel and hotel.

==Historical practice==
In ancient cultures hospitality involved welcoming the stranger and offering him food, shelter, and safety.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3uCAshDkca8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Hospitality&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9tN7fnevRAhUIfiYKHdKIBqgQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Hospitality&amp;f=false Pohl, Christine D., ''Making Room: Recovering Hospitality as a Christian Tradition'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1999] {{ISBN|9780802844316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global concepts==

===Ancient Greece===
In [[Ancient Greece]], hospitality was a right, with the host being expected to make sure the needs of his guests were met. The ancient Greek term ''[[Xenia (Greek)|xenia]]'', or ''theoxenia'' when a god was involved, expressed this ritualized guest-friendship relation. In Greek society a person's ability to abide by the laws of hospitality determined nobility and social standing. The Stoics regarded hospitality as a duty inspired by Zeus himself.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"/&gt;

===India and Nepal===
In [[India]] and [[Nepal]] hospitality is based on the principle ''[[Atithi Devo Bhav]]a'', meaning "the guest is God". This principle is shown in a number of stories where a guest is revealed to be a god who rewards the provider of hospitality. From this stems the Indian or Nepal practice of graciousness towards guests at home and in all social situations. The ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]],'' an ancient [[Indian literature|Indian work]] on [[ethics]] and [[morality]], explains the ethics of hospitality through its verses 81 through 90, dedicating a separate chapter on it (Chapter 9).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216064046/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm |date=2014-12-16 }} verses 71-80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf | title=Thirukkural English Translation and Commentary | publisher=W.H. Allen, &amp; Co | first = GU |last = Pope &lt;!--| authorlink=Thirukkural English Translation--&gt; | year=1886 | pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 002.jpg|thumb|Mosaic at [[Basilica of San Vitale|San Vitale, Ravenna]], Abraham and the angels, pre-547]]
Judaism praises hospitality to strangers and guests based largely on the examples of [[Abraham]] and [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] in the [[Book of Genesis]] ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|18:1–8|HE}} and {{Bibleverse-nb||Genesis|19:1–8|HE}}). In Hebrew, the practice is called ''hachnasat orchim'', or "welcoming guests". Besides other expectations, hosts are expected to provide nourishment, comfort, and entertainment for their guests,&lt;ref name="Kagan 1888 284"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kagan|first=Yisrael Meir|title=Ahavath chesed : the Love of Kindness|date=1888|publisher=Feldheim|location=Warsaw|isbn=0873061675|page=284|edition=2nd, rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the end of the visit, hosts customarily escort their guests out of their home, wishing them a safe journey.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud Sotah, 46B&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
In [[Christianity]], hospitality is a [[Theological virtues|virtue]] which is a reminder of sympathy for strangers and a rule to welcome visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Montandon, ''L'hospitalité au XVIIIe siècle'', Presses Universitaires Blaise Pascal, France, 2000, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; This is a virtue found in the Old Testament, with, for example, the custom of the [[foot washing]] of visitors or the [[kiss of peace]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter A. Elwell, ''Evangelical Dictionary of Theology'', Baker Academic, USA, 2001, p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Cunningham, Keith J. Egan, ''Christian Spirituality: Themes from the Tradition'', Paulist Press, USA, 1996, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; It was taught by [[Jesus]] in the New Testament. Indeed, Jesus said that those who had welcomed a stranger had welcomed him.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Baker, ''Hospitality and World Politics'', Springer, UK, 2013, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Some Western countries have developed a host culture for immigrants, based on the [[bible]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Olaf Kleist, Irial Glynn, ''History, Memory and Migration: Perceptions of the Past and the Politics of Incorporation'', Palgrave Macmillan, USA, 2012, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pashtun===
One of the main principles of [[Pashtunwali]] is [[Melmastia]]. This is the display of hospitality and profound respect to all visitors (regardless of race, religion, national affiliation or economic status) without any hope of remuneration or favour. [[Pashtuns]] will go to great lengths to show their hospitality.&lt;ref name="Banting"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afghanistan the People |last1=Banting |first1=Erinn |authorlink=|volume=|year=2003|publisher=Crabtree Publishing Company |location=|isbn=0-7787-9335-4|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fl8cd15sc7wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22Erinn%20Banting%22&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
Islam highly recommends one another to say peace be upon you [[salam Wa Alaikum]] to one another as Muhammad had said,
Muslims are obliged to treat their guest with kindness and peace even prisoners (in war), As Muhammad had said in authentic sources and verses from the Quran

[[Abu Aziz ibn Umair]] reported: I was among the prisoners of war on the day of the [[battle of Badr]]. Muhammad had said, “I enjoin you to treat the captives well.” After I accepted Islam, I was among the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] (Inhabitants of [[Madinah]]) and when the time of lunch or dinner arrived, I would feed dates to the prisoners for I had been fed bread due to the command of Muhammad. [[al-Mu’jam al-Kabīr 18444]]

Invite (all) to the Way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious: [[16:125]] Quran

Good hospitality is crucial in Islam even in business According to another report, Muhammad passed by a pile of food in the market. He put his hand inside it and felt dampness, although the surface was dry. He said:
“O owner of the food, what is this?’
The man said, ‘It was damaged by rain, O Messenger of God.’
He said, ‘Why did you not put the rain-damaged food on top so that people could see it!  Whoever cheats us is not one of us.” ([[Saheeh Muslim]])

===Celtic cultures===
Celtic societies also valued the concept of hospitality, especially in terms of protection. A host who granted a person's request for refuge was expected not only to provide food and shelter for his/her guest, but to make sure they did not come to harm while under their care.&lt;ref&gt;Charles MacKinnon, ''Scottish Highlanders'' (1984, [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] Books); page 76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current usage==
In the West today hospitality is rarely a matter of protection and survival and is more associated with [[etiquette]] and [[entertainment]]. However, it still involves showing respect for one's guests, providing for their needs, and treating them as equals. Cultures and subcultures vary in the extent to which one is expected to show hospitality to strangers, as opposed to personal friends or members of one's [[ingroup]].

===Anthropology of hospitality===
[[Jacques Derrida]] offers a model to understand hospitality that divides unconditional hospitality from conditional hospitality. Over the centuries, philosophers have devoted considerable attention to the problem of hospitality.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, J. (2000). “Hospitality”.  Angelaki: Journal of Theoretical Humanities,5(3), 3-18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, hospitality offers a paradoxical situation (like language) since inclusion of those who are welcomed in the sacred law of hospitality implies others will be rejected. Julia Kristeva (1991) alerts readers to the dangers of “perverse hospitality”, which consists of taking advantage of the vulnerability of aliens to dispossess them.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, J. (1991). Extranjeros para nosotros mismos, trad. de X. Gispert, Barcelona, Plaza &amp; Janes Editores (Hombre y Sociedad).&lt;/ref&gt; Hospitality serves to reduce the tension in the process of host-guest encounters, producing a liminal zone that combines curiosity about others and fear of strangers.&lt;ref&gt;Graburn, N. H. (1983). “The anthropology of tourism”. Annals of tourism research, 10(1), 9-33.&lt;/ref&gt; In general terms, the meaning of hospitality centres on the belief that strangers should be assisted and protected while traveling.&lt;ref&gt;Lashley, C. (1995). Towards an understanding of employee empowerment in hospitality services. International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management, 7(1), 27-32.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all voices are in agreement with this concept. Professor [[Anthony Pagden]] describes how the concept of hospitality was historically manipulated to legitimate the conquest of Americas by imposing the right of free transit, which was conducive to the formation of the modern nation-state. This suggests that hospitality is a political institution which can be ideologically deformed to oppress others.&lt;ref&gt;Pagden, A. (1995). Lords of all the worlds: ideologies of empire in Spain, Britain and France c. 1500-c. 1850. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64745">The '''ISASMELT''' process is an energy-efficient [[smelting]] process that was jointly developed from the 1970s to the 1990s by [[Mount Isa Mines]] Limited (a subsidiary of [[MIM Holdings Limited]] and now part of [[Glencore]] plc) and the Australian government’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ("[[CSIRO]]"). It has relatively low capital and operating costs for a smelting process.

[[File:Graph total Isasmelt capacity.png|thumbnail|The installed feed capacity of Isasmelt furnaces has grown as the technology has been accepted in smelters around the world. Graph courtesy of Xstrata Technology.]]

ISASMELT technology has been applied to lead, copper, and nickel smelting, and by 2013 fifteen plants were in operation in ten countries, with another five in various stages of development.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"&gt;[http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Installations/Pages/Installations.aspx List of Isasmelt installations]&lt;/ref&gt; The installed capacity of the operating plants in 2013 was over 8 million tonnes per year ('''t/y''') of feed materials, with additional capacity to come on line in 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref name = "XT"&gt;Information provided courtesy of Xstrata Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

Smelters based on the copper ISASMELT process are among the lowest-cost copper smelters in the world.&lt;ref name = "Bill, 2002"&gt;J L Bill, T E Briffa, A S Burrows, C R Fountain, D Retallick, J M I Tuppurainen, J S Edwards, and P Partington, "Isasmelt—Mount Isa copper smelter progress update," in: ''Sulfide Smelting 2002'', Eds R L Stephens and H Y Sohn (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania), 2002, 181–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ISASMELT Furnace==
An ISASMELT furnace is an upright-cylindrical shaped steel vessel that is lined with refractory bricks.&lt;ref name = "Brochure"&gt;Xstrata Technology, "ISASMELT – High productivity, clean smelting," ISASMELT brochure, 2012. Available from: [http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Publications/Documents/XTT_1603_ISASMELT_Broch_V2_SR-2.pdf Isasmelt brochure]. Accessed 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a molten bath of slag, matte or metal (depending on the application) at the bottom of the furnace. A steel lance is lowered into the bath through a hole in the roof of the furnace, and air or oxygen-enriched air that is injected through the lance into the bath causes vigorous agitation of the bath.

[[File:Cut-away view of an Isasmelt furnace.png|thumbnail|Cut-away view of an Isasmelt furnace. Image courtesy of Xstrata Technology.]]
Mineral concentrates or materials for recycling are dropped into the bath through another hole in the furnace roof or, in some cases, injected down the lance. These feed materials react with the oxygen in the injected gas, resulting in an intensive reaction in a small volume (relative to other smelting technologies).

ISASMELT lances contain one or more devices called "swirlers" that cause the injected gas to spin within the lance, forcing it against the lance wall, cooling it. The swirler consists of curved vanes around a central pipe forming an annular flow. &lt;ref name ="Abulnaga,1989"&gt; B E Abulnaga, "Air Pressure Measurements on the Isasmelt Copper Smelter at Mount Isa - Research paper No VI6-480 - Clayton, Vic - CSIRO Division of Mineral and Process Engineering, (Dec 1989), &lt;/ref&gt; They are designed to minimize pressure losses changing the angle from axial to tangential thus creating a strong vortex &lt;ref name = "Abulnaga,1990"&gt;B.E Abulnaga, Australian Patent Application 1990PK0047 "A smelter lance swirler , Applicant CSIRO (1990) &lt;/ref&gt;. The vortex helps mix liquids and solids with oxygen in the bath.&lt;ref name = Hooper,1992&gt;J Hooper, B.E. Abulnaga, "The Design and Experimental Evaluation of an Aerodynamic Swirler for a Top Injection Lance System," Research report No VI6-555 - Clayton,Vic: CSIRO Division of Mineral and Process Engineering, (1992). &lt;/ref&gt; The cooling effect results in a layer of slag "freezing" on the outside of the lance. This layer of solid slag protects the lance from the high temperatures inside the furnace. The tip of the lance that is submerged in the bath eventually wears out, and the worn lance is easily replaced with a new one when necessary. The worn tips are subsequently cut off and a new tip welded onto the lance body before it is returned to the furnace.

ISASMELT furnaces typically operate in the range of 1000–1200&amp;nbsp;°C, depending on the application.&lt;ref name = "Brochure"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"&gt;W J Errington, J H Fewings, V P Keran and W T Denholm, "The Isasmelt lead smelting process," ''Transactions of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy (Section C: Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy)'', 96, (1987), C1–C6.&lt;/ref&gt; The refractory bricks that form the internal lining of the furnace protect the steel shell from the heat inside the furnace.

The products are removed from the furnace through one or more "tap holes" in a process called "tapping". This can be either continuous removal or in batches, with the tap holes being blocked with clay at the end of a tap, and then reopened by drilling or with a thermic lance when it is time for the next tap.

The products are allowed to separate in a settling vessel, such as a rotary holding furnace or an electric furnace.

While smelting sulfide concentrates, most of the energy needed to heat and melt the feed materials is derived from the reaction of oxygen with the sulfur and iron in the concentrate. However, a small amount of supplemental energy is required. ISASMELT furnaces can use a variety of fuels, including coal, coke, petroleum coke, oil and natural gas. The solid fuel can be added through the top of the furnace with the other feed materials, or it can be injected down the lance. Liquid and gaseous fuels are injected down the lance.

==Advantages of the ISASMELT process==
[[File:Isasmelt feed chute.png|thumbnail|An ISASMELT furnace is typically fed with damp concentrate falling from a conveyor belt into the furnace. Image courtesy of Xstrata Technology.]]

The advantages of the ISASMELT process include:

* High productivity with a small footprint: Xstrata's copper smelter in Mount Isa treats over 1 million t/y of copper concentrate through a single furnace 3.75 m in diameter.&lt;ref name = "Brochure"/&gt; The small footprint makes the process well suited to retrofitting to existing smelters where there are significant space constraints&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"&gt;R R Bhappu, K H Larson and R D Tunis, "Cyprus Miami Mining Corporation – smelter modernization project summary and status", in: ''EPD Congress 1994'', Ed. G Warren (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1993), 555–570.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"&gt;Y Li and P S Arthur, "Yunnan Copper Corporation's new smelter – China's first ISASMELT", in: ''Yazawa International Symposium, Metallurgical and Materials Processing: Principles and Technologies, Volume II: High-temperature metals production'', Eds. F Kongoli, K Itagaki, C Yamauchi and H Y Sohn (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 2003), 371–384.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Simple operation: the ISASMELT furnace does not require extensive feed preparation as the feed can be discharged from a belt conveyor directly into the furnace&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt;
* high energy efficiency: installing an ISASMELT furnace in the Mount Isa copper smelter reduced energy consumption by over 80% (through better use of the inherent energy contained in the sulfide concentrate) compared with the roaster and reverberatory furnaces previously used there&lt;ref name = "Bill, 2002"/&gt;
* Flexibility in feed types: ISASMELT furnaces have been used to smelt copper, lead and nickel concentrates with a wide range of compositions,&lt;ref&gt;W G Davenport, "Copper extraction from the 60s into the 21st century", in: ''Proceedings of the Copper 99–Cobre 99 International Conference. Volume I—Plenary Lectures/Movement of Copper and Industry Outlook/Copper Applications and Fabrication,'' Eds G A Eltringham, N L Piret and M Sahoo (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1999), 55–79.&lt;/ref&gt; including high levels of magnetite,&lt;ref name = "Coulter"&gt;M D Coulter and C R Fountain, "The Isasmelt process for copper smelting", in: ''Non-ferrous Smelting Symposium, Port Pirie, South Australia, September 1989'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne), 237–240.&lt;/ref&gt; and secondary materials, such as copper scrap and lead-acid battery paste&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"&gt;P S Arthur and S P Hunt, "ISASMELT – 25 years of continuous evolution", in: ''The John Floyd International Symposium on Sustainable Developments in Metals Processing, Melbourne, 3–6 July 2005'', Eds. M Nilmani and W J Rankin (NCS Associates (Australia) Pty Ltd, 2005), 73–94.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flexibility in fuel types: ISASMELT furnaces can operate with a variety of fuels, including lump coal of varying ranks, coke (lump or fine), petroleum coke, oil (including recycled oil), natural gas, and liquid petroleum gas, depending on which is the most economic at the smelter's location&lt;ref name = "Brochure"/&gt;
* High turn-down ratio: the feed rate to a single ISASMELT installation can easily be scaled up or down, depending on the availability of concentrate and the needs of the smelter
* Low feed carry over: ISASMELT furnaces typically lose about 1% of the feed as carry-over with the waste gas, meaning that there is less material that needs to be returned to the furnace for retreatment&lt;ref name = "Brochure"/&gt;
* Effective containment of fugitive emissions: because the furnace has only two openings at the top, any fugitive emissions can easily be captured&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt;
* High elimination of deleterious minor elements: due to the flushing action of the gases injected into the ISASMELT furnace slags, copper ISASMELT furnaces have a high elimination of minor elements, such as bismuth and arsenic, that can have deleterious effects on the properties of the product copper&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 1991"&gt;C R Fountain, M D Coulter and J S Edwards, "Minor element distribution in the copper Isasmelt process", in: ''Copper '91, Volume IV'', Eds. C Díaz, C Landolt, A Luraschi and C J Newman (Pergamon Press: New York, 1991), 359–373.&lt;/ref&gt;
* High sulfur dioxide concentration in the waste gas: the use of oxygen enrichment gives the ISASMELT plants high sulfur dioxide concentrations in the waste gas stream, making acid plants cheaper to build and operate
* Relatively low operating cost: the energy efficiency of the process, the simple feed preparation, the relative lack of moving parts, low feed carry-over rates, low labour requirements and the ease of replacing lances and refractory linings when they are worn give the ISASMELT process relatively low operating costs&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt;
* Relatively low capital cost: the simplicity of the construction of the ISASMELT furnaces and the ability to treat concentrate without drying make it cheaper than other smelting processes.&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Samaniego"&gt;L M Samaniego and W T Pino, "Modernization and start-up of the SPCC Ilo smelter", in: ''Cu2007 – Volume III (Book I): The Carlos Díaz Symposium on Pyrometallurgy'', Eds.

==History of the ISASMELT Process==

===Early developmental work (1973–1980)===
The history of the ISASMELT process began with the invention in 1973 of the '''Sirosmelt lance''' by Drs Bill Denholm and John Floyd at the CSIRO.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"&gt;J H Fewings, "Management of Innovation – The ISASMELT process," Presented at the AMIRA ''Innovation in Metal Production'' technical meeting at Mount Isa, Queensland, 3–4 October 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"&gt;J M Floyd and D S Conochie, SIROSMELT – The first ten years, in ''Extractive Metallurgy Symposium'', pp 1–8, The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Melbourne Branch, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; The lance was developed as a result of investigations into improved tin-smelting processes, in which it was found that the use of a '''top-entry submerged lance''' would result in greater heat transfer and mass transfer efficiencies.&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt;

The idea of top-entry submerged lances goes back to at least 1902, when such a system was attempted in Clichy, France.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Queensland Government Mining Journal]]'', 15 January 1903, pp 27.&lt;/ref&gt; However, early attempts failed because of the short lives of the lances on submersion in the bath. The Mitsubishi copper smelting process is one alternative approach, wherein lances are used in a furnace, but they are not submerged into the bath. Instead, they blow oxygen-enriched air onto the surface of the slag (top jetting).&lt;ref&gt;T Shibasaki, K Kanamori and M Hayashi, "Development of (sic) large scale Mitsubishi furnace at Naoshima," in ''Proceedings of the Savard/Lee International Symposium on Bath Smelting'', Eds J K Brimacombe, P J Mackey, G J W Kor, C Bickert and M G Ranade (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1992), 147–158.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a water-cooled, top-jetting lance was the basis of the LD ([[Basic oxygen steelmaking|Linz-Donawitz]]) steelmaking process. This does not produce the same intensity of mixing in the bath as a submerged lance.&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt;

The CSIRO scientists first tried developing a submerged lance system using a water-cooled lance system, but moved to an air-cooled system because "scale up of the water-cooled lance would have been problematic".&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt; Introducing any water to a system involving molten metals and slags can result in catastrophic explosions, such as that in the Scunthorpe Steelworks in November 1975 in which 11 men lost their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rediron-steve.blogspot.com.au/2010/11/remembering-1975-scunthorpe-blast.html Remembering the 1975 Scunthorpe blast furnace disaster]. Accessed 14 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inclusion of the swirlers in the Sirosmelt lance and forming a splash coating of slag on the lance were the major innovations that led to the successful development of submerged lance smelting.

From 1973, the CSIRO scientists began a series of trials using the Sirosmelt lance to recover metals from industrial slags in Australia, including lead softener slag at the [[Port Pirie#History|Broken Hill Associated Smelters]] in [[Port Pirie]] (1973), tin slag from Associated Tin Smelters in [[Sydney]] (1974), copper converter slag at the [[Port Kembla, New South Wales#Industrial Change|Electrolytic Refining and Smelting]] ("ER&amp;S") [[Port Kembla, New South Wales|Port Kembla]] plant (1975) and copper anode furnace slag at Copper Refineries Limited (another subsidiary of MIM Holdings) in [[Townsville]] (1976) and of copper converter slag in [[Mount Isa]] (1977).&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt; The work then proceeded to smelting tin concentrates (1975) and then sulfidic tin concentrates (1977).&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt;

MIM and ER&amp;S jointly funded the 1975 Port Kembla converter slag treatment trials and MIM’s involvement continued with the slag treatment work in Townsville and Mount Isa.&lt;ref name = "Floyd, 1978"&gt;.J M Floyd, G J Leahy, R L Player and D J Wright, "Submerged combustion technology applied to copper slag treatment," in: ''The Aus.I.M.M. Conference, North Queensland, September 1978'', (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1978), 323–337.&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel with the copper slag treatment work, the CSIRO was continuing to work in tin smelting. Projects included a five tonne ("t") plant for recovering tin from slag being installed at Associated Tin Smelters in 1978, and the first sulfidic smelting test work being done in collaboration with Aberfoyle Limited, in which tin was fumed from pyritic tin ore and from mixed tin and copper concentrates.&lt;ref name = "Denholm"&gt;W T Denholm, "Matte fuming of tin from sulfide concentrates containing tin and copper, in: ''Australia–Japan Extractive Metallurgy Symposium, Sydney, Australia, 1980'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1980), 321–333.&lt;/ref&gt; Aberfoyle was investigating the possibility of using the Sirosmelt lance approach to improve the recovery of tin from complex ores, such as its mine at Cleveland, Tasmania, and the Queen Hill ore zone near [[Zeehan, Tasmania|Zeehan]] in [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref name = "Foo"&gt;K A Foo and J M Floyd, "Development of the matte fuming process for tin recovery from sulphide minerals," in: ''Lead–Zinc–Tin ’80: World Symposium on Metallurgy and Environmental Control'', Eds.

Melbourne Branch, Symposium on Extractive Metallurgy, November 1984'', (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1984), 9–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aberfoyle work led to the construction and operation in late 1980 of a four t/h tin matte fuming pilot plant at the [[Western Mining Corporation]]’s Kalgoorlie Nickel Smelter, located to the south of [[Kalgoorlie]], [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name = "Biehl"/&gt;

===Lead ISASMELT development===

====Small-scale work (1978–1983)====
In the early 1970s, the traditional blast furnace and sinter plant technology that was the mainstay of the lead smelting industry was coming under sustained pressure from more stringent environmental requirements, increased energy costs, decreasing metal prices and rising capital and operating costs.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt;

Many smelting companies were seeking new processes to replace sinter plants and blast furnaces. Possibilities included the QSL lead smelting process, the Kivcet process, the [[Kaldo converter|Kaldo top-blown rotary converter]], and adapting Outokumpu’s successful copper and nickel flash furnace to lead smelting.&lt;ref&gt;C O Bounds, "Innovative processes: lead-zinc-tin," in: ''1990 Elliott Symposium on Chemical Process Metallurgy'', Eds P J Koros and G R St Pierre (Iron and Steel Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania), 1990, 73–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

MIM was seeking ways to safeguard the future of its Mount Isa lead smelting operations. It did this in two ways:
# working to improve the environmental and operational performance of its existing operations
# investigating new technologies.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt;
MIM investigated new technologies by arranging plant testing of large parcels of Mount Isa lead concentrates for all the then process options except for the Kivcet process. At the same time, it had been aware of the use of top-jetting lances in the Mitsubishi and [[Boliden AB#History|Kaldo]] processes, and of top-entry submerged combustion lance investigations undertaken by [[ASARCO]] Limited (which had a long association with MIM, including being a shareholder in MIM Holdings) in the 1960s. This stimulated MIM’s interest in the Sirosmelt lance, which was seen as a way to produce a robust submerged lance.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt;

Following the copper slag trials of 1976–1978, MIM initiated a joint project with the CSIRO in 1978 to investigate the possibility of applying Sirosmelt lances to lead smelting.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt;

The work began with computer modelling the equilibrium thermodynamics (1978) and was followed by laboratory bench-scale test work using large alumina silicate crucibles (1978–1979). The results were sufficiently encouraging that MIM built a 120&amp;nbsp;kg/h test rig in Mount Isa. It began operation in September 1980. This was used to develop a two-stage process to produce lead bullion from Mount Isa lead concentrate. The first stage was an oxidation step that removed virtually all the sulfur from the feed, oxidising the contained lead to lead oxide (PbO) that was largely collected in the slag (some was carried out of the furnace as lead oxide fume that was returned for lead recovery). The second stage was a reduction step in which the oxygen was removed from the lead to form lead metal.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt;

==== The lead ISASMELT pilot plant (1983–1990) ====
Following the 120&amp;nbsp;kg/h test work, MIM decided to proceed to install a 5&amp;nbsp;t/h lead ISASMELT pilot plant in its Mount Isa lead smelter. It bought Aberfoyle’s matte fuming furnace and transported it from Kalgoorlie to Mount Isa, where it was rebuilt and commissioned in 1983&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt; to demonstrate the first stage of the process in continuous operation and for testing the reduction step using batches of high-lead slag.&lt;ref name = "Matthew"&gt;S P Matthew, G R McKean, R L Player and K E Ramus, "The continuous Isasmelt lead process," in ''Lead-Zinc ’90'', Eds T S Mackey and R D Prengaman (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale Pennsylvania), 1990, 889–901.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key features of the pilot plant was that it was run by operations’ personnel in the lead smelter as though it was an operations’ plant.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt; The high lead slag produced by the continuous smelting of the lead concentrate was subsequently treated in the sinter plant, thus increasing the production of the lead smelter by up to 17%.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"&gt;P Bartsch, C R Fountain and B Anselmi, "Radio Hill project," in: ''Pyrosem WA'', Eds. E J Grimsey and N D Stockton (Murdoch University Press: Perth, Western Australia, 1990), 232–250.&lt;/ref&gt; This gave the operations’ people ownership of the plant and an incentive to make it work, thus ensuring management and maintenance priority. It also gave MIM assurance that the process simple enough to be operable in a production environment, with normal staff and supervision, and that it was robust enough to withstand normal control excursions.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt; In addition to the continuous operation of lead concentrate to produce high-lead slag, the pilot plant was used to produce lead metal from batches of the slag,&lt;ref name = "Matthew"/&gt; investigate the wear rates of the furnace’s refractory lining and lances, and initial work aimed at developing a low-pressure version of the Sirosmelt lance. The result was a lance design that allowed operation at significantly lower pressure than the initial values of about 250 kilopascal (gauge) ("kPag"), thus reducing operating costs.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt;

MIM built a second, identical furnace next to the first, and commissioned it in August 1985. This combination of furnaces was used to demonstrate the two-stage process in continuous operation in mid-1987.&lt;ref name = "Matthew"/&gt; However, for most of the time the two furnaces were not able to operate simultaneously due to a constraint in the capacity of the baghouse used to filter the lead dust from the waste gas.&lt;ref name = "Matthew"/&gt;

A series of process improvements, particularly in the waste gas handling system, resulted in increasing the throughput of the plant from the initial design of 5 t/h to 10 t/h.&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt; The pilot plant had treated more than 125,000 t of lead concentrate by April 1989.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt;

The two furnaces were also used to develop a process to recover lead from the Mount Isa lead smelter’s drossing operations.&lt;ref name = "Matthew"/&gt;

==== The lead ISASMELT demonstration plant (1991–1995) ====
Based on the results of the pilot plant work, the MIM Holdings Board of Directors approved the construction of an A$65 million&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"&gt;R L Player, C R Fountain and J M I Tuppurainen, "Isasmelt developments," in: ''Mervyn Willis Symposium and Smelting &amp; Refining Course, 6–8 July 1992'' (The University of Melbourne: Melbourne, 1992), 20:1–20:13.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstration plant, capable of producing 60,000 t/y of lead bullion.&lt;ref name = "Matthew"/&gt; This plant operated from early 1991 until 1995.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2005"&gt;W J Errington, P Arthur, J Wang and Y Dong, [http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Publications/Technical%20Papers/XT_ISASMELT_Paper_ErringtonPbIsa.pdf "The Isa-YMG lead smelting process,"] in: ''Lead-Zinc ’05, Kyoto, Japan, 17–19 October 2005''. Accessed: 16 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially designed to treat 20 t/h of lead concentrate using lance air enriched to 27%. However, the oxygen originally designated for its use was diverted to the more profitable copper smelting operations, and the feed rate to the lead ISASMELT demonstration plant was severely restricted.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2005"/&gt; When there was sufficient oxygen available in 1993 to increase the enrichment level to 33–35%, treatment rates of up to 36 t/h of concentrate were achieved, with residual lead in the final reduction furnace slag being in the range of 2–5%.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2005"/&gt;

The two-stage approach to ISASMELT lead smelting was partly driven by the relatively low lead content of Mount Isa lead concentrates (typically in the range of 47–52% lead during the lead ISASMELT development period).&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R M S Watsford, "Lead-zinc-silver ore concentration by Mount Isa Mines Ltd, Mount Isa, Queensland," in: ''Mining and Metallurgical Practices in Australasia, The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume'', Ed. J T Woodcock (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1980) 208–213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P D Munro, "Lead-zinc-silver ore concentration practice at the lead-zinc concentrator of Mount Isa Mines Limited, Mount Isa, Qld," in: ''Australasian Mining and Metallurgy, The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume, Second Edition'', Eds. J T Woodcock and J K Hamilton (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Melbourne, 1993), 498–503.&lt;/ref&gt; Trying to produce lead bullion in a single furnace with such low concentrate grades would result in excessive fuming of lead oxide with a huge amount of material that would have to be returned to the furnace to recover the lead&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt; and, consequently, a higher energy demand as that material had to be reheated to the furnace temperatures.

Concentrates with higher lead contents can be smelted directly into lead metal in a single furnace without excess fuming.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt; This was demonstrated on the large scale in 1994, when 4000 t of concentrate containing 67% lead were treated at rates up to 32 t/h with lance air enriched to 27%. During these trials, 50% of the lead in the concentrate was converted to lead bullion in the smelting furnace, while most of the rest ended up as lead oxide in the smelting furnace slag.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2005"/&gt;

Like the lead ISASMELT pilot plant, the lead ISASMELT demonstration plant suffered from constraints imposed by the waste gas handling system. In the case of the demonstration plant, the problem was caused by sticky fume that formed an insulating layer on the convection tube bundles of the waste heat boilers, significantly reducing the heat transfer rates and thus the ability of the boilers to reduce the waste gas temperature.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; As the plant used baghouses to filter lead fume from the waste gas, it was necessary to reduce the temperature of the gas below the point at which the bags would be damaged by high temperatures. The problem was solved by allowing cool air to mix with the hot waste gas to lower the temperature to a level at which the baghouse could operate.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; This reduced the ISASMELT plant’s capacity because it was again limited by the volume of gas that could be filtered by the baghouse.

The lead ISASMELT demonstration plant was mothballed in 1995 because there was insufficient concentrate to keep both it and the rest of the lead smelter operating.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; It was too small to treat all the Mount Isa lead concentrate by itself.

==== Commercial primary-lead ISASMELT plants (2005– ) ====
The first commercial primary-lead ISASMELT furnace was installed at the Yunnan Chihong Zinc and Germanium Company Limited (YCZG) greenfield zinc and lead smelting complex at Qujing in Yunnan Province in China.&lt;ref name = "YCZG"&gt;[http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Installations/Pages/CymgLeadSmelter.aspx YCZG Isasmelt plant.] Accessed 17 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This furnace was part of a plant consisting of the ISASMELT furnace and a blast furnace specially designed to treat high-lead ISASMELT slag.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2005"/&gt; The ISASMELT furnace was designed to produce both the slag and lead bullion, with about 40% of the lead in the concentrate being converted to lead bullion in the ISASMELT furnace.&lt;ref name = "YCZG"/&gt;

The ISASMELT–blast furnace combination was designed to treat 160,000 t/y of lead concentrate.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt;

The second commercial primary-lead ISASMELT furnace was commissioned at Kazzinc’s smelting complex at Ust-Kamenogorsk in Kazakhstan in 2012. It is designed to treat 300,000 t/y of lead concentrate, again using an ISASMELT–blast furnace combination.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt;

YCZG is constructing another lead ISASMELT at a new greenfield smelter in Huize in China, and this is due to be commissioned in 2013.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt;

==== Secondary-lead smelting (1982– ) ====
While the lead ISASMELT 5 t/h pilot plant was being designed in 1982–1983, MIM continued to use the 120&amp;nbsp;kg/h test rig to develop other processes, including the dross treatment process previously mentioned, and the treatment of lead-acid battery paste for lead recycling.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt;

The MIM Holdings Board of Directors approved the construction of an ISASMELT plant at Britannia Refined Metals, the company’s lead refinery at Northfleet in the United Kingdom, for commercial recovery of lead from battery paste to supplement the existing plant, which used a short rotary furnace to produce 10,000 t/y of lead.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"&gt;W J Errington, P Hawkins and A Lim, [http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Publications/Technical%20Papers/ISASMELT%20%20FOR%20LEAD%20RECYCLING.pdf "ISASMELT for lead recycling,’] in: ''PbZn 2010'', Eds. A Siegmund, L Centomo, C Geenen, N Piret, G Richards and R Stephens (Wiley Publishing, 2010). Accessed: 17 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The new plant increased annual production to 30,000 t/y of recycled lead, and was commissioned in 1991.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"/&gt; The ISASMELT furnace was used to produce low-antimony lead bullion from the battery paste and an antimony-rich slag that contained 55–65% lead oxide. While it was possible to recover the lead from the slag in the ISASMELT furnace by a reduction step, the total throughput of the plant was increased by treating the slag in the short rotary furnace when sufficient quantities of the slag had been generated.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"/&gt; The plant was designed to treat 7.7 t/h of battery paste, but routinely treated 12 t/h.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"/&gt; The plant was shut down in 2004 when Xstrata Zinc, which took over the MIM Holdings lead operations, decided to leave the lead recycling business.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"/&gt;

A second lead ISASMELT plant for recovering lead from recycled batteries was commissioned in 2000 in Malaysia at Metal Reclamation Industries’ Pulau Indah plant.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"/&gt; This ISASMELT plant has a design capacity of 40,000 t/y of lead bullion.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt;

=== Copper ISASMELT development ===

==== Small-scale test work (1979–1987) ====
Scientists at the CSIRO conducted small-scale test work on copper sulfide concentrate in 1979,&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt; using the CSIRO’s 50&amp;nbsp;kg Sirosmelt test rig.&lt;ref name = "Floyd, 1980"&gt;J M Floyd, N Grave and B W Lightfoot, "Small pilot plant trials of Sirosmelt copper smelting," In: ''Australia–Japan Extractive Metallurgy Symposium, Sydney, Australia, 1980'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1980), 63–74.&lt;/ref&gt; These trials included producing copper matte containing 40–52% copper and, in some cases, converting the matte to produce blister copper.&lt;ref name = "Floyd, 1980"/&gt;

The results of this work were sufficiently encouraging that MIM in 1983&lt;ref name = "Pritchard"&gt;J Pritchard, R L Player and W J Errington, "Isasmelt technology for copper smelting," Technical Paper #A89-5 (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; undertook its own copper smelting test work program using its 120&amp;nbsp;kg/h test rig, which had by then been rerated to 250&amp;nbsp;kg/h.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; It was found that the process was easy to control and that copper loss to slag was low.&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt; It was also learned that the process could easily recover copper from copper converter slag concentrate, of which there was a large stockpile at Mount Isa.&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt;

==== The copper ISASMELT demonstration plant (1987–1992) ====
Construction of a 15 t/h demonstration copper ISASMELT plant began in 1986. The design was based on MIM’s 250&amp;nbsp;kg/h test work and operating experience with the lead ISASMELT pilot plant.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; It cost A$11 million&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt; and was commissioned in April 1987.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; The initial capital cost was recovered in the first 14 months of operation.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt;

As with the lead ISASMELT pilot plant, the copper ISASMELT demonstration plant was integrated into copper smelter operations&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt; and justified by the 20% (30,000 t/y) increase in copper production that it provided.&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt; It quickly treated the entire backlog of converter slag concentrate, which could not be treated at high rates in the reverberatory furnaces without generating [[magnetite]] ("Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;") accretions that would necessitate shutting down the reverberatory furnaces for their removal.&lt;ref name = "Casley"&gt;G E Casley, J Middlin and D White, "Recent developments in reverberatory furnace and converter practice at the Mount Isa Mines copper smelter," in: ''Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, Volume 1,'' (The Metallurgical Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1976), 117–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

The demonstration copper ISASMELT plant was used to further develop the copper process. [[Refractory]] life was initially shorter than expected&lt;ref name = "Fountain"&gt;C R Fountain, J M I Tuppurainen and N R Whitworth, "Operation of the copper Isasmelt plants at Mount Isa Mines Limited, Mount Isa, Qld," in: ''Australasian Mining and Metallurgy, The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume, Second Edition'', Eds. J T Woodcock and J K Hamilton (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Melbourne, 1993), 695–700.&lt;/ref&gt; and considerable effort was devoted to understanding the reasons and attempting to extend the life of the refractories.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt; At the end of the life of the demonstration plant, the longest refractory life achieved was 90 weeks.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt;

Lance life was also low initially.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt; Inexperienced operators could destroy a lance in as little as 10 minutes.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt; However, as a result of modifications to the lance design, the development of techniques to determine the position of the lance in the bath, and a rise in the operating experience, the typically lance life was extended to a week.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt;

The demonstration plant was commissioned with high-pressure (700 kPag) air injected down the lance.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; Later, after extensive testing of low-pressure lance designs and trials using oxygen enrichment of the lance air, a 70 t/d oxygen plant and a 5 Nm3/s blower with a discharge pressure of 146 kPag were purchased.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; The new lance design was capable of operating at pressures below 100 kPag.&lt;ref name = "Pritchard"/&gt; Using enrichment of the oxygen in the lance air to 35%, the demonstration plant throughput was lifted to 48 t/h of concentrate, and the gross energy used during smelting was reduced from 25.6 GJ/t of contained copper to 4.1 GJ/t.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt;

==== Commercial primary-copper ISASMELT plants (1990– ) ====
The successful operation and development of the demonstration copper ISASMELT, and the degree of interest shown in the new process by the global smelting community, gave MIM Holdings sufficient confidence to license the ISASMELT technology to external companies,&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1999"&gt;W J Errington, P S Arthur and C R Fountain, "Isasmelt – clean, efficient smelting," in: ''Proceedings of Global Conference on Environmental and Metallurgy [sic], GME ’99, 24–27 May 1999, Beijing, China'', Eds. D Qiu and Y Chu (International Academic Publishers: Beijing, 1999), 172–164.&lt;/ref&gt; so an agreement under which MIM could incorporate the Sirosmelt lance into ISASMELT technology was signed with the CSIRO in 1989.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt;

===== AGIP Australia Pty Ltd =====
MIM signed the first ISASMELT licence agreement with Agip Australia Proprietary Limited ("Agip") in July 1990. Agip, a subsidiary of the Italian oil company [[Eni|ENI]], was developing the Radio Hill nickel-copper deposit near Karratha in Western Australia.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt; MIM and representatives of Agip conducted a series of trials in which 4 tonnes of Radio Hill concentrate was smelted in the 250&amp;nbsp;kg/h test rig at Mount Isa.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt;

The Agip ISASMELT plant was designed to treat 7.5 t/h of the Radio Hill concentrate and produce 1.5 t/h of granulated matte with a combined nickel and copper content of 45% for sale.,&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; It was the same size as the copper ISASMELT demonstration plant (2.3 m internal diameter) and had a 5.5 Nm3/s blower to provide the lance air.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt; Commissioning of the plant began in September 1991;&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; however, the Radio Hill mine and smelter complex were forced to close by low nickel prices after less than six months,&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; before commissioning was completed.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; The ISASMELT furnace achieved its design capacity within three months.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; Subsequent owners of the mine focussed on mining and mineral processing only, and the ISASMELT plant has been dismantled.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt;

===== Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. =====
In 1973, the [[Freeport-McMoRan]] Copper and Gold Inc. ("Freeport") smelter at [[Miami, Arizona]], installed a 51 MW electric furnace at its Miami smelter. The decision was based on a long-term electrical power contract with the [[Salt River Project]] that provided the company with a very low rate for electricity.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt; This contract expired in 1990 and the resulting increase in electricity prices prompted the then owners of the smelter, [[Cyprus Mines Corporation#Later history|Cyprus Miami Mining Corporation]] ("Cyprus"), to seek alternative smelting technologies to provide lower operating costs.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt;

The technologies evaluated included the:
* Contop flame cyclone reactor
* [[Flash smelting|Inco flash furnace]]
* ISASMELT
* Mitsubishi furnace
* Noranda reactor
* [[Flash smelting|Outokumpu flash furnace]]
* Teniente furnace.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt;
The Contop, Inco, Mitsubishi and Outokumpu processes "were all eliminated primarily because of their high dust levels, high capital costs and poor adaptability to the existing facility". The Teniente converter was ruled out because it required the use of the electric furnace for partial smelting. The Noranda reactor was not selected "because of its high refractory wear and its poor adaptability to the existing plant due to the handling of the reactor slag".&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt; ISASMELT was chosen as the preferred technology and a licence agreement was signed with MIM in October 1990. The major factor in the decision to select the ISASMELT technology was the ability to fit it into the existing plant and to maximise the use of existing equipment and infrastructure, while the major disadvantage was seen to be the risks associated with scaling up the technology from the Mount Isa demonstration plant.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt;

The Miami copper ISASMELT furnace was designed to treat 590,000 t/y (650,000 short tons per year) of copper concentrate, a treatment rate that was constrained by the capacity of the sulfuric acid plant used to capture the sulfur dioxide from the smelter’s waste gases.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt; The existing electric furnace was converted from smelting duties to a slag cleaning furnace and providing matte surge capacity for the converters.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt; The ISASMELT furnace was commissioned on 11 June 1992 and in 2002 treated over 700,000 t/y of concentrate.&lt;ref name = "Voltura"&gt;S A Voltura, "Continuous improvements at the Phelps Dodge Miami Mining smelter," ''Society of Mining Engineers Annual Meeting, 24–26 February 2004, Denver Colorado'', Preprint 04-78.&lt;/ref&gt; The modernisation of the Miami smelter cost an estimated US$95 million.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt;

In 1993, the Cyprus Minerals Company merged with AMAX to form the [[Cyprus Mines Corporation#Later history|Cyprus Amax Minerals company]], which was in turn taken over by the [[Phelps Dodge]] Corporation in late 1999. Phelps Dodge was acquired by Freeport in 2006.

===== Mount Isa Mines Limited =====
The third commercial copper ISASMELT plant was installed in MIM’s Mount Isa copper smelter at a cost of approximately A$100 million.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt; It was designed to treat 104 t/h of copper concentrate, containing 180,000 t/y of copper, and it began operation in August 1992.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt;

A significant difference between the Mount Isa copper ISASMELT plant and all the others is that it uses an Ahlstrom Fluxflow&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; waste heat boiler&lt;ref name = "Peippo"&gt;R Peippo, H Holopainen and J Nokelainen, "Copper smelter waste heat boiler technology for the next millennium," in: ''Proceedings of Copper ’99-Cobre ’99 International Conference, Volume V—Smelting Operations and Advances'', Eds. D B George, W J Chen, P J Mackey and A J Weddick (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1999), 71–82.&lt;/ref&gt; to recover heat from the furnace waste gas. This boiler uses a recirculating fluid bed of particles to rapidly quench the gas as it leaves the furnace, and then uses the enhanced heat transfer properties of solid–solid contact to cool the particles as they are carried past boiler tubes that are suspended in a shaft above the bed.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt; The high heat transfer rate means that the Fluxflow&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; boiler is relatively compact compared with conventional waste heat boilers and the rapid cooling of the waste gas limits the formation of sulfur trioxide ("SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;"), which in the presence of water forms sulfuric acid that can cause corrosion of cool surfaces.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1997"&gt;W J Errington, J S Edwards and P Hawkins, "Isasmelt technology—current status and future development," ''The Journal of the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy'', July–August 1997, 161–168. http://www.saimm.co.za/Journal/v097n04p161.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mount Isa copper smelter 2002.jpg|thumbnail|Mount Isa copper smelter in 2002. The building beneath the left-hand crane is the ISASMELT plant.]]

In the early years of operation, the Fluxflow&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; boiler was the cause of significant down time, because the rate of wear of the boiler tubes was much higher than expected.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1997"/&gt; The problems were solved by understanding the gas flows within the boiler redesigning the boiler tubes to minimise the effects of erosion.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1997"/&gt;

The life of the refractory bricks in the ISASMELT furnace was initially shorter than expected and a water cooling system was briefly considered to extend them;&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1997"/&gt; however, this was not installed and operational improvements have resulted in a significant extension of the life of the lining without this capital and operating expense.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"&gt;C R Fountain, "Isasmelt and IsaMills—models of successful R&amp;D," in: ''Young Leaders’ Conference, Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, 19–21 March 2002'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2002), 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1998, the refractory lining lives have exceeded the two-year design life,&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; with lives of the 8th and 9th linings almost reaching three years.&lt;ref name = "Burford"&gt;B Burford, "The ISASMELT technology package: over 30 years of innovation," ''The AusIMM Bulletin'', February 2009, 26–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent lining lasted for 50 months, with the one before that lasting for 44 months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://industryadvocate.com.au/smelter-shutdown-record-in-sight/ "Smelter shutdown record in sight,"] ''Queensland Industry Advocate'', 26 May 2014. Viewed 3 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first years of operation at Mount Isa, the throughput of the ISASMELT furnace was constrained by problems with some of the ancillary equipment in the plant, including the boiler, slag granulation system and concentrate filters.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"/&gt; The ultimate constraint was the decision during its construction to keep one of the two reverberatory furnaces on line to increase the copper smelter production to 265,000 t/y of anode copper. The smelter’s Peirce-Smith converters became a bottleneck and the feed rate of the ISASMELT furnace had to be restrained to allow sufficient matte to be drawn from the reverberatory furnace to prevent it freezing solid.&lt;ref name = "Bill, 2002"/&gt; The ISASMELT 12-month rolling average of the feed rate fell just short of 100 t/h for much of this period, not quite reaching the design annual average of 104 t/h.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"/&gt; MIM decided to shut down the reverberatory furnace in 1997, and the ISASMELT plant 12-month rolling mean feed rate quickly exceeded the 104 t/h design when this constraint was lifted.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"/&gt;

The performance of the ISASMELT plant was sufficiently encouraging that MIM decided to expand the ISASMELT treatment rate to 166 t/h by adding a second oxygen plant to allow higher enrichment of the lance air.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"/&gt; As a result, by late 2001 it had achieve a peak rate of 190 t/h of concentrate, and the smelter produced a peak annual total of 240,000 t of anode copper.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"/&gt; At that time, the Mount Isa copper smelter, together with its copper refinery in Townsville, was among the lowest cost copper smelters in the world.

Lance life is typically two weeks, with lance changes taking 30 to 40 minutes, and repairs usually being limited to replacement of the lance tips.&lt;ref name = "Gao"&gt;M Gao, P S Arthur and N Aslin, [http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Publications/Technical%20Papers/XT_ISASMELT_Paper_Hainan%20conference%20EN_2.pdf "Proven technologies from Xstrata and their applications for copper smelting and refining in China,"] paper presented at Hainan Conference, China. Accessed 20 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, MIM commissioned a second rotary holding furnace that operates in parallel with the existing holding furnace.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2006"&gt;P S Arthur, "ISASMELT - 6,000,000 t/y and rising," in: ''Sohn International Symposium on Advanced Processing of Metals and Materials, Volume 8 – International Symposium on Sulfide Smelting 2006'', Eds.

===== Sterlite Industries (India) Limited =====
[[Sterlite Industries]] ("Sterlite"), now a subsidiary of [[Vedanta Resources]] plc ("Vedanta"), built a copper smelter in [[Thoothukudi|Tuticorin]] using an ISASMELT furnace and [[Converting (metallurgy)#Equipment|Peirce-Smith converters]]. The smelter was commissioned in 1996&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt; and was designed to produce 60,000 t/y of copper (450,000 t/y of copper concentrate),&lt;ref name = "Burford"/&gt; but by increasing the oxygen content of the lance air and making modifications to other equipment, the ISASMELT furnace feed rate was increased to the point where the smelter was producing 180,000 t/y of copper.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt;

Sterlite commissioned a new ISASMELT furnace in May 2005&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2006"/&gt; that was designed to treat 1.3 million t/y of copper concentrate,&lt;ref name = "Burford"/&gt; and the smelter’s production capacity was expanded to 300,000 t/y of copper.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; The new plant reached its design capacity, measured over a three-month period, six months after it started treating its first feed.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2006"/&gt; Vedanta’s website states that the new ISASMELT furnace was successfully ramped up "in a record period of 45 days".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sterlite-industries.com/about_us/Our_History.aspx Sterlite Industries - Our history]. Accessed 20 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then Sterlite has decided to further expand its copper production by installing a third ISASMELT smelter and new refinery using IsaKidd technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Installations/Pages/SterliteIndustriesCopperSmelter.aspx Sterlite plant]. Accessed 20 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The new smelter will have a design capacity of 1.36 million t/y of copper concentrate (containing 400,000 t/y of copper), processed through a single ISASMELT furnace.&lt;ref name = "Alvear, 2010"&gt;G R F Alvear, P S Arthur and P Partington, [http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Publications/Technical%20Papers/Alvear.pdf "Feasibility to profitability with copper ISASMELT,"] in: ''Proceedings of Copper 2010, Hamburg, Germany, 6–10 June 2010''. Accessed 21 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Yunnan Copper Corporation Limited =====
In the 1990s, the Chinese government decided to increase the efficiency of the Chinese economy and reduce the environmental effects of heavy industry by modernising plants.&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"/&gt; As a response, the Yunnan Copper Corporation Limited ("YCC") upgraded its existing plant, which was based on a sinter plant and an electric furnace, with a copper ISASMELT furnace.&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"/&gt; As with the Miami smelter, the electric furnace was converted from smelting duty to separation of matte and slag and providing matte surge capacity for the converters, and again, the small footprint of the ISASMELT furnace was very important in retrofitting it to the existing smelter.&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"/&gt;

The YCC ISASMELT plant had a design capacity of 600,000 dry t/y of copper concentrate and started smelting concentrate on 15 May 2002.&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"/&gt; YCC placed a lot of emphasis on training its operators, sending people to Mount Isa for training over a seven-month period during 2001 ahead of the ISASMELT commissioning.&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"/&gt; The total cost of the smelter modernisation program, including the ISASMELT furnace, was 640 million yuan (approximately US$80 million) and the smelter’s concentrate treatment rate increased from 470,000 t/y to 800,000 t/y as a result.&lt;ref name = "Shi"&gt;Y F Shi, "Yunnan Copper’s Isasmelt – successful smelter modernization in China," in: ''Sohn International Symposium on Advanced Processing of Metals and Materials, Volume 8 – International Symposium on Sulfide Smelting 2006'', Eds. F. Kongoli and R G Reddy (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 2006), 151–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The transfer of operating knowledge from MIM to YCC was sufficient for the first ISASMELT furnace refractory lining to last for two years, a marked improvement on the life of the initial lining of other plants.&lt;ref name = "Shi"/&gt;

YCC described the modernisation project as "a great success, achieving all that was expected."&lt;ref name = "Shi"/&gt; Energy consumption per tonne of blister copper produced decreased by 34% as a result of installing the ISASMELT furnace, and YCC estimated that during the first 38 months of operation, it saved approximately US$31.4 million through reduced energy costs alone,&lt;ref name = "Shi"/&gt; giving the modernisation a very short payback by industry standards.

In 2004, YCC’s management was presented with awards for Innovation in Project Management and the National Medal for High Quality Projects by the Chinese government to mark the success of the smelter modernisation project.&lt;ref name = "Shi"/&gt;

Xstrata subsequently licensed YCC to build three more ISASMELT plants, one in Chuxiong in Yunnan Province, China to treat 500,000 t/y of copper concentrate, one in Liangshan in Sichuan Province, China&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt; and the other in Chambishi in Zambia to treat 350,000 t/y of concentrate.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt; Chuxiong and Chambishi were commissioned in 2009.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt; Liangshan was commissioned in 2012.&lt;ref name = "XT"/&gt;

===== Mopani Copper Mines plc =====
[[Mopani Copper Mine]]s ("Mopani") was part of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Limited until it was privatised in 2000. It owns the Mufulira smelter, which operated with an electric furnace with a nominal capacity of 420,000 t/y of copper concentrate (180,000 t/y of new copper).&lt;ref name = "Ross"&gt;J Ross and D de Vries, [http://www.isasmelt.com/downloads/XTpaper_Mopani_MSUPyromet05.pdf "Mufulira smelter upgrade project – "Industry’ smelting on the Zambian Copperbelt."] Accessed 9 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Mopani decided to install a copper ISASMELT plant that could treat 850,000 t/y of copper concentrate, including a purpose-designed electric matte settling furnace to separate the ISASMELT matte and slag and also return slag from the smelter’s Peirce-Smith converters.&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt;

Before committing to the ISASMELT technology, Mopani considered the following process options:
* an electric furnace
* a flash furnace, including one operating direct-to-blister
* the Mitsubishi smelting process
* the Teniente converter
* the Noranda reactor
* an Ausmelt furnace
* an ISASMELT furnace.&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt;
Mopani considered electric furnaces unproven at the proposed concentrate feed rates, and the low sulfur dioxide concentration in the waste gas would make its capture very expensive.&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt; Flash furnaces and the Mitsubishi process were excluded because:
* they were considered too technically complex for the Zambian environment
* they were not well suited for retrofitting to the Mufulira smelter
* they had a high capital cost associated with them.&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt;
Mopani excluded the Teniente converter and Noranda reactor because of the poor performance of the Teniente converter at the other Zambian smelter operating at the time and because of "the relatively inexperienced technical resources available at the time".&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt;

Mopani selected ISASMELT technology over Ausmelt technology after visits to operating plants in Australia, the United States of America, and China.&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt; The total cost of the project was US$213 million. The first feed was smelted in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Installations/Pages/MopaniCopperMinesCopperSmelter.aspx Mopani Isasmelt plant.] Accessed 21 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Southern Peru Copper Corporation =====
The [[Southern Peru Copper Corporation]] ("SPCC") is a subsidiary of the [[Southern Copper Corporation]] ("SCC"), one of the world’s largest copper companies&lt;ref name = "Walqui"&gt;H Walqui and C Noriega, "Design, construction and start-up of the Ilo smelter modernization project," presented at the ''Society of Mining Engineers Annual Meeting, 25–28 February 2007, Denver, Colorado''.

In the 1990s, SPCC was seeking to modernise its smelter at Ilo in southern Peru as part of 1997 commitment to the Peruvian government to capture at least 91.7% of the sulfur dioxide generated in its smelting operations by January 2007.&lt;ref name = "Walqui"/&gt; It initially selected flash smelting technology to replace its reverberatory furnaces, at a cost of almost US$1 billion;&lt;ref name = "Samaniego"/&gt; however, one of the first actions following Grupo México’s acquisition of ASARCO was to review the proposed Ilo smelter modernisation plans.&lt;ref name = "Samaniego"/&gt;

Six different technologies were evaluated during the review. These were:
* Outokumpu flash smelting
* the Mitsubishi process
* the Noranda reactor
* ISASMELT
* Ausmelt
* the Teniente converter.&lt;ref name = "Walqui"/&gt;
The ISASMELT technology was selected as a result of the review, resulting in a reduction in the capital cost of almost 50% and was also the alternative with the lowest operating costs.&lt;ref name = "Samaniego"/&gt;

The plant was commissioned in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Installations/Pages/SouthernPeruCopperCorporationCopperSmelter.aspx SPCC Isasmelt plant.] Accessed 21 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, the plant had an average feed rate of 165.2 t/h of concentrate and 6.3 t/h of reverts (cold copper-bearing materials that arise from spillage and accretions in the pots used to transport matte or other molten materials).&lt;ref name = "Alvear, 2010"/&gt;

In the fourth quarter of 2011, the [[First Quantum Minerals]] board approved the construction of an ISASMELT-based smelter at Kansanshi in Zambia.&lt;ref name = "FQM 4Q"&gt;First Quantum Minerals Ltd, [http://www.first-quantum.com/files/doc_financials/2011%20FQM%20Financial%20Statements%20and%20Q4%20MDA.pdf "Consolidated Financial Statements, December 31, 2011, December 31 2010 and January 1, 2010".] Accessed 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The smelter is to process 1.2 million t/y of copper concentrate to produce over 300,000 t/y of copper and 1.1 million t/y of sulfuric acid as a by-product.&lt;ref name = "FQM 4Q"/&gt; Construction is expected to be completed by mid-2014,&lt;ref name = "FQM PR"&gt;[http://www.first-quantum.com/default.aspx?SectionId=5cc5ecae-6c48-4521-a1ad-480e593e4835&amp;LanguageId=1&amp;PressReleaseId=cc391e4d-0c43-4ff9-b97e-42e68679c184 First Quantum press release.] Accessed 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and the capital cost is estimated at US$650 million.&lt;ref name = "FQM IP"&gt;[http://www.first-quantum.com/files/doc_presentations/Presentation%20-%20December%20-%20FINAL.pdf First Quantum investor presentation, December 2012.] Accessed 10 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated operating cost was given as US$69 per tonne of concentrate.&lt;ref name = "FQM IP"/&gt;

The Kansanshi copper smelter project is estimated to be worth US$340–500 million per year in reduced concentrate freight costs, export duties and sulfuric acid costs.&lt;ref name = "FQM 4Q"/&gt;

==== Commercial secondary-copper ISASMELT plants ====
In addition to treating copper concentrates, ISASMELT furnaces have also been built to treat secondary (scrap) copper materials.

===== Umicore N.V. =====
In the early 1990s, technical personnel from the then [[Umicore|Union Miniére]] worked with MIM Holdings personnel to develop an ISASMELT-based process to treat scrap materials and residues containing copper and lead.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1999"/&gt; Union Miniére operated a smelter at [[Hoboken, Antwerp|Hoboken]], near [[Antwerp]]en in [[Belgium]], that specialised in recycling scrap non-ferrous materials. The test work program was undertaken using an ISASMELT test rig at MIM Holdings’ lead refinery, Britannia Refined Metals, at [[Northfleet]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1999"/&gt;

A demonstration plant was designed by MIM Holdings personnel and operated for several months at the Hoboken smelter site.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"&gt;J S Edwards and G R F Alvear, "Converting using ISASMELT technology," in: ''Cu2007 – Volume III (Book 2): The Carlos Díaz Symposium on Pyrometallurgy'', Eds. A R M Warner, C J Newman, A Vahed, D B George, P J Mackey and A Warczok (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum: Westmount, Quebec, 2007), 17–28.&lt;/ref&gt; The new smelter was commissioned in the final quarter of 1997&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1999"/&gt; and in 2007 was treating up to 300,000 t/y of secondary materials.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt; The installation of the ISASMELT furnace replaced "a large number of unit processes" and substantially reduced operating costs at the Hoboken smelter.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2006"/&gt;

Umicore’s Hoboken plant uses a two-step process in a single furnace. The first step involves the oxidation of the feed to form a copper matte and a lead-rich slag. The slag is then tapped and the remaining copper matte is then converted to blister copper.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt; The lead-rich slag is subsequently reduced in a blast furnace to produce lead metal, while the copper is refined and the contained precious metals recovered.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt;

===== Aurubis AG =====
The then Hüttenwerke Kayser smelter at [[Lünen]] in Germany installed an ISASMELT plant in 2002 to replace three blast furnaces and one Peirce-Smith converter used for smelting scrap copper.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt; The company was subsequently bought by [[Aurubis#History|Norddeutsche Affinerie AG]], which in turn became [[Aurubis]] AG.

The process used at the Lünen smelter involves charging the furnace with copper residues and scrap containing between 1 and 80% copper and then melting it in a reducing environment. This produces a "black copper phase" and a low-copper silica slag. Initially the black copper was converted to blister copper in the ISASMELT furnace.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt; However, in 2011 the smelter was expanded as part of the "KRS Plus" project. A top-blown rotary converter is now used to convert the black copper and the ISASMELT furnace runs continuously in smelting mode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aurubis.com/en/responsibility/environment/production-sites/luenen "Arubis' achievements at the Lünen production site."] Accessed 26 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G R F Alvear, A S Burrows and S Nikolic, [http://www.expomin.cl/marketing/pdf/2012/presentacion_gerardo_alvear.pdf "Modern, flexible and clean technologies for recovery and recycling of valuable materials,"] ''2nd International Workshop on Recovery of Metals from Mining Waste, M2R2, Santiago, Chile, 12–13 April 2012''. Accessed 26 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The installation of the ISASMELT furnace increased the overall copper recovery in the plant by reducing losses to slag, reduced the number of furnaces in operation, decreased the waste gas volume, and decreased energy consumption by more than 50%. The production capacity exceeds the original design by 40%.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt;

Often, informal, [[spoken language]], "everyday language" is less precise than any more [[formal language|formal]]  or academic languages.

Language might be said to be imprecise because it exhibits one or more of the following features:
* [[ambiguity]] – when a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs.
* [[vagueness]] – when borderline cases interfere with an interpretation
* [[equivocation]] – the misleading use of a term with more than one meaning or sense (by glossing over which meaning is intended at a particular time)
* [[accent (fallacy)|accent]] – when the use of bold or italics causes confusion over the meaning of a statement
* [[Syntactic ambiguity|amphiboly]] – when a sentence may be interpreted in more than one way due to ambiguous sentence structure.

While '''imprecise language''' is not desirable in various scientific fields, it may be helpful, illustrative or discussion-stimulative in other contexts. Imprecision in a discourse may or may not be the intention of the author(s) or speaker(s). The role of imprecision may depend on audience, end goal, extended context and subject matter. Relevant players and real stakes will also bear on [[truth-grounds]] of statements.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''k''-synchronized sequence}}
In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical computer science]], a '''''k''-synchronized sequence''' is an infinite [[sequence]] of terms ''s''(''n'') characterized by a [[Finite-state machine|finite automaton]] taking as input two strings ''m'' and ''n'', each expressed in some fixed [[Radix|base]] ''k'', and accepting if ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s''(''n''). The class of ''k''-synchronized sequences lies between the classes of [[Automatic sequence|''k''-automatic sequences]] and [[k-regular sequence|''k''-regular sequences]].

==Definitions==

===As relations===
Let Σ be an alphabet of ''k'' symbols where ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, and let [''n'']&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the base-''k'' representation of some number ''n''. Given ''r''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, a subset ''R'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^{r}&lt;/math&gt; is ''k''-synchronized if the relation {([''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., [''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)} is a right-synchronized&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Frougny | first1 = C. | last2 = Sakarovitch | first2 = J. | title = Synchronized rational relations of finite and infinite words | journal = Theoret. Comput. Sci. | volume = 108 | year = 1993 | pages = 45–82 | doi=10.1016/0304-3975(93)90230-Q }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rational set#Rational relations and rational functions|rational relation]] over Σ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;Σ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;, where (''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; ''R''.&lt;ref name=CM&gt;Carpi &amp; Maggi (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language-theoretic===
Let ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 be a natural number and let ''f'': &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; be a map, where both ''n'' and ''f''(''n'') are expressed in base ''k''. The sequence ''f''(''n'') is ''k''-synchronized if the language of pairs &lt;math&gt;\{(n, f(n))\}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Regular language|regular]].

==History==
The class of ''k''-synchronized sequences was introduced by Carpi and Maggi.&lt;ref name=CM /&gt;

==Example==

===Subword complexity===
Given a ''k''-automatic sequence ''s''(''n'') and an infinite string ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s''(1)''s''(2)..., let ρ&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;(n) denote the subword complexity of ''S''; that is, the number of distinct [[Substring|subwords]] of length ''n'' in ''S''. Goč, Schaeffer, and Shallit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Goč | first1 = D. | last2 = Schaeffer | first2 = L. | last3 = Shallit | first3 = J. | others = Editors Béal MP., Carton O. | title = Subword complexity and ''k''-synchronization | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume=7907 | location=Berlin | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | year=2013 | isbn=978-3-642-38770-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that there exists a finite automaton accepting the language
:&lt;math&gt;
\{(n, m)_k \mid n \geq 0 \text{ and } m = \rho_S(n)\}.
&lt;/math&gt;
This automaton guesses the endpoints of every contiguous block of symbols in ''S'' and verifies that each subword of length ''n'' starting within a given block is novel while all other subwords are not. It then verifies that ''m'' is the sum of the sizes of the blocks. Since the pair (''n'',&amp;nbsp;''m'')&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is accepted by this automaton, the subword complexity function of the ''k''-automatic sequence ''s''(''n'') is ''k''-synchronized.

==Properties==
''k''-synchronized sequences exhibit a number of interesting properties. A non-exhaustive list of these properties is presented below.
*Every ''k''-synchronized sequence is [[k-regular sequence|''k''-regular]].&lt;ref name=CM26&gt;Carpi &amp; Maggi (2010), Proposition 2.6&lt;/ref&gt;
*Every [[Automatic sequence|''k''-automatic sequence]] is ''k''-synchronized. To be precise, a sequence ''s''(''n'') is ''k''-automatic if and only if ''s''(''n'') is ''k''-synchronized and ''s''(''n'') takes on finitely many terms.&lt;ref name=CM28&gt;Carpi &amp; Maggi (2010), Proposition 2.8&lt;/ref&gt; This is an immediate consequence of both the above property and the fact that every ''k''-regular sequence taking on finitely many terms is ''k''-automatic.
*The class of ''k''-synchronized sequences is closed under termwise sum and termwise composition.&lt;ref name=CM21&gt;Carpi &amp; Maggi (2010), Proposition 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CM22&gt;Carpi &amp; Maggi (2010), Proposition 2.2&lt;/ref&gt;
*The terms of any ''k''-synchronized sequence have a linear growth rate.&lt;ref name=CM25&gt;Carpi &amp; Maggi (2010), Proposition 2.5&lt;/ref&gt;
*If ''s''(''n'') is a ''k''-synchronized sequence, then both the subword complexity of ''s''(''n'') and the palindromic complexity of ''s''(''n'') (similar to subword complexity, but for distinct [[palindrome]]s) are ''k''-regular sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Carpi | first1 = A. | last2 = D'Alonzo | first2 = V. | title = On factors of synchronized sequences | journal = Theoret.

In [[philosophy]] and [[media studies]], a '''knowledge space''' is described as an emerging anthropological space in which the knowledge of individuals becomes the primary focus for social structure, values, and beliefs. The concept is put forward and explored by philosopher and media critic [[Pierre Lévy (philosopher)|Pierre Lévy]] in his 1997 book ''Collective Intelligence''.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Levy, ''Collective Intelligence'', trans. Robert Bononno, Perseus Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anthropological Space ==
Levy's notion of the "knowledge space" relies on his conception of anthropological spaces, which he defines as "a system of proximity (space) unique to the world of humanity (anthropological), and thus dependent on human technologies, significations, language, culture, conventions, representations, and emotions" (5). Building on the language of the philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], he states that "anthropological spaces in themselves are neither infrastructures nor superstructures but planes of existence, frequencies, velocities, determined within the social spectrum" (147). Each space contains "worlds of signification" (149) by which humans come to understand and make sense of the world. Furthermore, although one space may dominate, many spaces can and do exist simultaneously.

Levy describes three existing anthropological spaces. They are:
# ''Earth'' - This space corresponds with hunter-gatherer eras in which people identify themselves by familial relationships, derive meaning via intimate connection with the signifier, and where conceptions of time are driven by reminiscence. Passed down narratives become the guiding instruments that exist within the body of the community.
# ''Territorial'' - This space corresponds to the rise of civilizations and the insistent division of things and signs. Within this space history becomes closed and authoritative.  Within territorial space people identify themselves by property ownership and nationality and look to religion for guidance, with the book become the substrate of choice.
# ''Commodity'' - This space corresponds to the rise of industrial revolution and world-markets in which people begin to identify themselves through one's career and wealth. In this space, meaning becomes illusory, our sense of time becomes abstract and uniform (through the use of clocks) while our sense of space becomes configured into a network. Statistics and probability become guiding concepts and indexes and networks of information becomes the substrate through which knowledge is passed on. (175,210)

==The emerging knowledge space==
The knowledge space is an emerging anthropological space which, while it has always existed (139), is only now coming into fruition as a guiding space of humanity. In this space, singularities (individuals) are recognized as singularities and knowledge becomes the guiding value for humanity. Since all human experience represents unique knowledge, within the knowledge space all individuals are valued for their unique knowledge regardless of race (earth space), nationality (territorial space), or economic status (commodity space). Within this space static identity gives way to the "quantum identities" as individuals become participates and the distinction between of "us" and "them" disappears (159). Instead, humanity forms "collective intelligences" in which knowledge is valued and freely traded. What is "real" becomes "that which implies the practical activity, intellectual and imaginary, of living subjects" (168). Life, experiences, and knowledge become the underlying and ever changing guiding path for human societies.

== Relation to Technology ==
Levy's theories rely heavily on the technological developments of the 1990s, particularly the rise of biotechnology, nanotechnology, the Internet, new media and information technologies. In chapter 3, he describes how technologies have made a shift from the molar to the molecular (a move which makes literal a distinction by Delueze and Guattari) in that technologies now handle units as individuals (his term is "singularities") rather than in mass. He suggests that this mirrors our rising recognition of the individuals as singularities rather than massive conglomerated groups.

In [[algebra]], a '''linear topology''' on a left ''A''-module ''M'' is a [[topology]] on ''M'' that is invariant under translations and admits a fundamental system of neighborhood of 0 that consists of submodules of ''M''. If there is such a topology, ''M'' is said to be '''linearly topologized'''. If ''A'' is given a discrete topology, then ''M'' becomes a [[topological module|topological ''A''-module]] with respect to a linear topology.

Market Abuse is split into two different aspects (under EU definitions):&lt;ref name=EU/&gt;
#[[Insider dealing]]: where a person who has information not available to other investors (for example, a director with knowledge of a takeover bid) makes use of that information for personal gain
#[[Market manipulation]]: where a person knowingly gives out false or misleading information (for instance, about a company's financial circumstances) in order to influence the price of a share for personal gain

The '''Matthew effect''', '''Matthew principle''', or '''Matthew effect of accumulated advantage''' can be observed in many aspects of life and fields of activity. It is sometimes summarized by the adage "[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The term was coined by sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] in 1968&lt;ref name=Merton1968/&gt; and takes its name from the [[Parable of the talents or minas]] in the biblical [[Gospel of Matthew]].  Merton credited his collaborator and wife, sociologist [[Harriet Zuckerman]], as co-author of the concept of the Matthew effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/merton/matthewii.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The concept is named according to two of the [[Parables of Jesus]] in the [[synoptic Gospels]] (Table 2, of the [[Eusebian Canons]]).

The concept concludes both synoptic versions of the [[Parable of the talents or minas|parable of the talents]]:

{{quote|For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.|[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 25:29, [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]].|source=}}

{{quote|I tell you, that to every one who has will more be given; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.|[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 19:26, [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]].|source=}}

The concept concludes two of the three synoptic versions of the parable of the [[lamp under a bushel]] (absent in the version of Matthew):

{{quote|For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away|[[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 4:25, [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]].|source=}}

{{quote|Take heed then how you hear; for to him who has will more be given, and from him who has not, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away.|[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 8:18, [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]].|source=}}

The concept is presented again in Matthew outside of a parable during [[Jesus|Christ]]'s explanation to his disciples of the purpose of parables:

{{quote|And he answered them, "To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For to him who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away."|[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 13:11–12, [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]].|source=}}

==Sociology of science==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Scientific misconduct]] --&gt;
In the [[sociology of science]], "Matthew effect" was a term coined by [[Robert K. Merton]] to describe how, among other things, eminent scientists will often get more credit than a comparatively unknown researcher, even if their work is similar; it also means that credit will usually be given to researchers who are already famous.&lt;ref name=Merton1968&gt;{{cite journal |author=Merton, Robert K. |year=1968 |url=http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/merton/matthew1.pdf |title=The Matthew Effect in Science |journal=Science |volume=159 |issue=3810 |pages=56–63 |doi=10.1126/science.159.3810.56 |pmid=17737466|bibcode=1968Sci...159...56M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Merton | first1 = Robert K | year = 1988 | title = The Matthew Effect in Science, II: Cumulative advantage and the symbolism of intellectual property | url = http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/merton/matthewii.pdf| journal = ISIS | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 606–623 | doi=10.1086/354848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a prize will almost always be awarded to the most senior researcher involved in a project, even if all the work was done by a [[graduate student]].  This was later formulated by [[Stephen Stigler]] as [[Stigler's law of eponymy]]&amp;nbsp;– "No scientific discovery is named after its original discoverer"&amp;nbsp; – with Stigler explicitly naming Merton as the true discoverer, making his "law" an example of itself.

Merton furthermore argued that in the scientific community the Matthew effect reaches beyond simple reputation to influence the wider communication system, playing a part in social selection processes and resulting in a concentration of resources and talent.  He gave as an example the disproportionate visibility given to articles from acknowledged authors, at the expense of equally valid or superior articles written by unknown authors.  He also noted that the concentration of attention on eminent individuals can lead to an increase in their self-assurance, pushing them to perform research in important but risky problem areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/159/3810/56 Abstract of Merton's 1968 paper] "The Matthew Effect in Science".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
{{Original research|section|date=January 2012}}
As [[Credit (creative arts)|credit]] is valued in science, specific claims of the Matthew effect are contentious.  Many examples below exemplify more famous scientists getting credit for discoveries due to their fame, even as other less notable scientists had preempted their work.

* In [[algorithmic information theory]], the notion of [[Kolmogorov complexity]] is named after the famous mathematician [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] even though it was [[independently discovered]] and published by [[Ray Solomonoff]] a year before Kolmogorov.

: Ray Solomonoff  [...] introduced [what is now known as] "Kolmogorov complexity"  in a long journal paper in 1964.  [...] This makes Solomonoff the first inventor and raises the question whether we should talk about Solomonoff complexity. [...]

* There are many uncontroversial examples of the Matthew effect in mathematics, where a concept is due to one mathematician (and well-documented as such), but is attributed to a later (possibly much later), more famous mathematician who worked on it. For instance, the [[Poincaré disk model]] and [[Poincaré half-plane model]] of [[hyperbolic space]] are both named for [[Henri Poincaré]], but were introduced by [[Eugenio Beltrami]] in 1868 (when Poincaré was 14 and had not as yet contributed to hyperbolic geometry).
* A  model for career progress quantitatively incorporates the Matthew Effect in order to predict the distribution of individual career length in competitive professions. The model predictions are validated by analyzing the empirical distributions of career length for careers in science and professional sports (e.g. [[Major League Baseball]]).&lt;ref name=Petersen2011&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Petersen |first=Alexander M. |author2=Jung, Woo-Sung |author3=Yang, Jae-Suk |author4=Stanley, H.

* In his 2011 book ''[[The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined]]'', [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologist]] [[Steven Pinker]] refers to the Matthew Effect in societies, whereby everything seems to go right in some, and wrong in others. He speculates in Chapter 9 that this could be the result of a positive feedback loop in which reckless behavior by some individuals creates a chaotic environment that encourages reckless behavior by others. He cites research by [[Martin Daly]] and [[Margo Wilson]] showing that the more unstable the environment, the more steeply people discount the future, and thus the less forward-looking their behavior.
* A large Matthew effect was discovered in a study of science funding in the Netherlands, where winners just above the funding threshold were found to accumulate more than twice as much funding during the subsequent eight years as non-winners with near-identical review scores that fell just below the threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bol | first1 = T. | last2 = de Vaan | first2 = M. | last3 = van de Rijt | first3 = A. | year = 2018 | title = The Matthew Effect in Science Funding | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/19/4887.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = PNAS | volume = 115 | issue = 19 | pages = 4887–4890 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In science, dramatic differences in the productivity may be explained by three phenomena: sacred spark, cumulative advantage, and search costs minimization by journal editors. The sacred spark paradigm suggests that scientists differ in their initial abilities, talent, skills, persistence, work habits, etc. that provide particular individuals with an early advantage. These factors have a multiplicative effect which helps these scholars succeed later. The cumulative advantage model argues that an initial success helps a researcher gain access to resources (e.g., teaching release, best graduate students, funding, facilities, etc.), which in turn results in further success. Search costs minimization by journal editors takes place when editors try to save time and effort by consciously or subconsciously selecting articles from well-known scholars. Whereas the exact mechanism underlying these phenomena is yet unknown, it is documented that a minority of all academics produce the most research output and attract the most citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Serenko | first1 = A. | last2 = Cox | first2 = R. | last3 = Bontis | first3 = N. | last4 = Booker | first4 = L. | year = 2011 | title = The Superstar Phenomenon in the Knowledge Management and Intellectual Capital Academic Discipline | url = http://www.aserenko.com/papers/JOI_Serenko_Superstar_Phenomenon_Published.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Informetrics | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 333–345 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
In education, the term "Matthew effect" has been adopted by psychologist [[Keith Stanovich]] to describe a phenomenon observed in research on how new readers acquire the skills to read: early success in acquiring reading skills usually leads to later successes in reading as the learner grows, while failing to learn to read before the third or fourth year of schooling may be indicative of lifelong problems in learning new skills.

This is because children who fall behind in reading would read less, increasing the gap between them and their peers. Later, when students need to "read to learn" (where before they were learning to read), their reading difficulty creates difficulty in most other subjects. In this way they fall further and further behind in school, dropping out at a much higher rate than their peers.

In the words of Stanovich:
{{quote|Slow reading acquisition has cognitive, behavioral, and motivational consequences that slow the development of other cognitive skills and inhibit performance on many academic tasks. In short, as reading develops, other cognitive processes linked to it track the level of reading skill. Knowledge bases that are in reciprocal relationships with reading are also inhibited from further development. The longer this developmental sequence is allowed to continue, the more generalized the deficits will become, seeping into more and more areas of cognition and behavior. Or to put it more simply&amp;nbsp;– and sadly&amp;nbsp;– in the words of a tearful nine-year-old, already falling frustratingly behind his peers in reading progress, "Reading affects everything you do."&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Marilyn J. (1990).'' Beginning to Read: Thinking and Learning about Print''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Network science ==
In network science, the Matthew effect is used to describe the [[preferential attachment]] of earlier nodes in a network, which explains that these nodes tend to attract more links early on.&lt;ref name="Barabasi1999"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barabási|first=A-L|year=1999|title=Emergence of scaling in random networks|journal=Science|volume=286|pages=509–512|doi=10.1126/science.286.5439.509|pmc=|pmid=10521342|quote=|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|authorlink=|author2=Albert, R|accessdate=|arxiv=cond-mat/9910332|bibcode=1999Sci...286..509B}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Because of preferential attachment, a node that acquires more connections than another one will increase its connectivity at a higher rate, and thus an initial difference in the connectivity between two nodes will increase further as the network grows, while the degree of individual nodes will grow proportional with the square root of time."&lt;ref name="Perc2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perc|first=Matjaž|year=2014|title=The Matthew effect in empirical data|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/11/98/20140378|journal=Interface|volume=12|issue=104|pages=20140378|doi=10.1098/rsif.2014.0378|pmc=|pmid=|quote=|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|authorlink=|accessdate=|arxiv=1408.5124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Matthew Effect therefore explains the growth of some nodes in vast networks such as the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Networks, Complexity And Internet Regulation – Scale-Free Law|last=Guadamuz|first=Andres|date=2011|publisher=Edward Elgar|isbn=9781848443105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Naree'''''  ({{lang-en|Woman}}) is a 1992 Bangladeshi book about feminism and [[women’s rights]] written by [[Humayun Azad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amarboi.com/2011/11/nari-humayun-azad-pdf.html |script-title=নারী - হুমায়ূন আজাদ |publisher=amarboi.com |language=bn |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21}}{{bn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was considered incendiary, and was banned on 19 November 1995, by the [[government of Bangladesh]]. Five years later, though, in 2000, the ban was lifted, following a legal battle that Azad won.&lt;ref name=Mukto-mona&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mukto-mona.com/link/book.htm |title=Recommended Books |publisher=Mukto-Mona |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[High Court of Bangladesh]] decided that the prohibition was invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banned-books.info/book-content.php?key=90&amp;time=1363397449 |title=Banned-books info. |publisher=banned-books.info |date= |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==

The book in Bengali is a feminist analysis of women's status and condition in civilizations created by men. This is the first comprehensive discussion in Bengali about feminism and the difficulties Bengali women face in daily life. The [[Political radicalism|radicalism]] inherent in the work was enough for many to think back on ''[[The Second Sex]]'' written by French feminist [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and ''[[Sexual Politics]]'' by American feminist [[Kate Millett]]. In the work, Azad takes readers on a journey through the broad swathes of experience feminist writers in [[South Asia]] have gone through in their writings. Azad is critical of acclaimed figures, notably [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], for what he considers their anti-feminist perceptions of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ahsan  |first=Syed Badrul |date=2 March 2013 |title=Words that have made a difference |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=270984 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azad analytically compiles the feminist ideas of the west, which underlie the feminist contributions of the subcontinent's socio-political reformers.&lt;ref name=Mukto-mona/&gt;

Typically, the behavior of a nonlinear system is described in mathematics by a '''nonlinear system of equations''', which is a set of simultaneous [[equation]]s in which the unknowns (or the unknown functions in the case of [[differential equation]]s) appear as variables of a [[polynomial]] of degree higher than one or in the argument of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] which is not a polynomial of degree one.
In other words, in a nonlinear system of equations, the equation(s) to be solved cannot be written as a [[linear combination]] of the unknown [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] or [[function (mathematics)|functions]] that appear in them. Systems can be defined as nonlinear, regardless of whether known linear functions appear in the equations. In particular, a differential equation is ''linear'' if it is linear in terms of the unknown function and its derivatives, even if nonlinear in terms of the other variables appearing in it.

As nonlinear dynamical equations are difficult to solve, nonlinear systems are commonly approximated by linear equations ([[linearization]]). This works well up to some accuracy and some range for the input values, but some interesting phenomena such as [[soliton]]s, [[chaos theory|chaos]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Earth--Atmospheric--and-Planetary-Sciences/12-006JFall-2006/CourseHome/index.htm Nonlinear Dynamics I: Chaos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212045134/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Earth--Atmospheric--and-Planetary-Sciences/12-006JFall-2006/CourseHome/index.htm |date=2008-02-12}} at [http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/index.htm MIT's OpenCourseWare]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mathematical singularity|singularities]] are hidden by linearization. It follows that some aspects of the dynamic behavior of a nonlinear system can appear to be counterintuitive, unpredictable or even chaotic. Although such chaotic behavior may resemble [[randomness|random]] behavior, it is in fact not random. For example, some aspects of the weather are seen to be chaotic, where simple changes in one part of the system produce complex effects throughout. This nonlinearity is one of the reasons why accurate long-term forecasts are impossible with current technology.

Some authors use the term '''nonlinear science''' for the study of nonlinear systems. This is disputed by others:

{{quote|Using a term like nonlinear science is like referring to the bulk of zoology as the study of [[negation|non]]-elephant animals.|[[Stanislaw Ulam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=David K.|title=Nonlinear physics: Fresh breather|journal=Nature|date=25 November 2004|volume=432|issue=7016|pages=455–456|doi=10.1038/432455a|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1134179|language=en|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2004Natur.432..455C}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[mathematics]], a [[linear map]] (or ''linear function'') &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is one which satisfies both of the following properties:
*Additivity or [[superposition principle]]: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y);&lt;/math&gt;
*Homogeneity: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(\alpha x) = \alpha f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Additivity implies homogeneity for any [[rational number|rational]] ''α'', and, for [[continuous function]]s, for any [[real number|real]] ''α''. For a [[complex number|complex]] ''α'', homogeneity does not follow from additivity. For example, an [[antilinear map]] is additive but not homogeneous. The conditions of additivity and homogeneity are often combined in the superposition principle
:&lt;math&gt;f(\alpha x + \beta y) = \alpha f(x) + \beta f(y)&lt;/math&gt;

An equation written as
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = C&lt;/math&gt;

is called '''linear''' if &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear map (as defined above) and '''nonlinear''' otherwise. The equation is called ''homogeneous'' if &lt;math&gt;C = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The definition &lt;math&gt;f(x) = C&lt;/math&gt; is very general in that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; can be any sensible mathematical object (number, vector, function, etc.), and the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; can literally be any [[map (mathematics)|mapping]], including integration or differentiation with associated constraints (such as [[boundary values]]). If &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; contains [[derivative|differentiation]] with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the result will be a [[differential equation]].

==Nonlinear algebraic equations==
{{Main|Algebraic equation|System of polynomial equations}}
Nonlinear [[algebraic equation]]s, which are also called ''[[polynomial equation]]s'', are defined by equating [[polynomial]]s to zero. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + x - 1 = 0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For a single polynomial equation, [[root-finding algorithm]]s can be used to find solutions to the equation (i.e., sets of values for the variables that satisfy the equation). However, systems of algebraic equations are more complicated; their study is one motivation for the field of [[algebraic geometry]], a difficult branch of modern mathematics. It is even difficult to decide whether a given algebraic system has complex solutions (see [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]]). Nevertheless, in the case of the systems with a finite number of complex solutions, these [[systems of polynomial equations]] are now well understood and efficient methods exist for solving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lazard |first1= D. |title= Thirty years of Polynomial System Solving, and now? |doi= 10.1016/j.jsc.2008.03.004 |journal= Journal of Symbolic Computation |volume= 44 |issue= 3 |pages= 222–231 |year= 2009 |pmid= |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nonlinear recurrence relations==
A nonlinear [[recurrence relation]] defines successive terms of a [[sequence]] as a nonlinear function of preceding terms. Examples of nonlinear recurrence relations are the [[logistic map]] and the relations that define the various [[Hofstadter sequence]]s. Nonlinear discrete models that represent a wide class of nonlinear recurrence relationships include the NARMAX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Moving Average with eXogenous inputs) model and the related [[nonlinear system identification]] and analysis procedures.&lt;ref name="SAB1"&gt;Billings S.A. "Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains". Wiley, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches can be used to study a wide class of complex nonlinear behaviors in the time, frequency, and spatio-temporal domains.

==Nonlinear differential equations==
A [[simultaneous equations|system]] of [[differential equation]]s is said to be nonlinear if it is not a [[linear system]]. Problems involving nonlinear differential equations are extremely diverse, and methods of solution or analysis are problem dependent. Examples of nonlinear differential equations are the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] in fluid dynamics and the [[Lotka–Volterra equation]]s in biology.

One of the greatest difficulties of nonlinear problems is that it is not generally possible to combine known solutions into new solutions. In linear problems, for example, a family of [[linearly independent]] solutions can be used to construct general solutions through the [[superposition principle]]. A good example of this is one-dimensional heat transport with [[Dirichlet boundary conditions]], the solution of which can be written as a time-dependent linear combination of sinusoids of differing frequencies; this makes solutions very flexible. It is often possible to find several very specific solutions to nonlinear equations, however the lack of a [[superposition principle]] prevents the construction of new solutions.

===Ordinary differential equations===
First order [[ordinary differential equation]]s are often exactly solvable by [[separation of variables]], especially for autonomous equations. For example, the nonlinear equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d u}{d x} = -u^2&lt;/math&gt;

has &lt;math&gt;u=\frac{1}{x+C}&lt;/math&gt; as a general solution (and also ''u'' = 0 as a particular solution, corresponding to the limit of the general solution when ''C'' tends to infinity). The equation is nonlinear because it may be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{du}{d x} + u^2=0&lt;/math&gt;

and the left-hand side of the equation is not a linear function of ''u'' and its derivatives. Note that if the ''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; term were replaced with ''u'', the problem would be linear (the [[exponential decay]] problem).

Second and higher order ordinary differential equations (more generally, systems of nonlinear equations) rarely yield [[closed-form expression|closed-form]] solutions, though implicit solutions and solutions involving [[nonelementary integral]]s are encountered.

Common methods for the qualitative analysis of nonlinear ordinary differential equations include:

*Examination of any [[conserved quantities]], especially in [[Hamiltonian system]]s
*Examination of dissipative quantities (see [[Lyapunov function]]) analogous to conserved quantities
*Linearization via [[Taylor expansion]]
*Change of variables into something easier to study
*[[Bifurcation theory]]
*[[Perturbation theory|Perturbation]] methods (can be applied to algebraic equations too)

===Partial differential equations===
{{See also|List of nonlinear partial differential equations}}
The most common basic approach to studying nonlinear [[partial differential equation]]s is to change the variables (or otherwise transform the problem) so that the resulting problem is simpler (possibly even linear). Sometimes, the equation may be transformed into one or more [[ordinary differential equation]]s, as seen in [[separation of variables]], which is always useful whether or not the resulting ordinary differential equation(s) is solvable.

Another common (though less mathematic) tactic, often seen in fluid and heat mechanics, is to use [[scale analysis (mathematics)|scale analysis]] to simplify a general, natural equation in a certain specific [[boundary value problem]]. For example, the (very) nonlinear [[Navier-Stokes equations]] can be simplified into one linear partial differential equation in the case of transient, laminar, one dimensional flow in a circular pipe; the scale analysis provides conditions under which the flow is laminar and one dimensional and also yields the simplified equation.

Other methods include examining the [[method of characteristics|characteristics]] and using the methods outlined above for ordinary differential equations.

===Pendula===
{{Main|Pendulum (mathematics)}}

[[File:PendulumLayout.svg|thumb|Illustration of a pendulum|right|200px]]
[[File:PendulumLinearizations.png|thumb|Linearizations of a pendulum|right|200px]]

A classic, extensively studied nonlinear problem is the dynamics of a [[pendulum (mathematics)|pendulum]] under the influence of [[gravity]]. Using [[Lagrangian mechanics]], it may be shown&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/dynamics.html David Tong: Lectures on Classical Dynamics]&lt;/ref&gt; that the motion of a pendulum can be described by the [[dimensionless]] nonlinear equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 \theta}{d t^2} + \sin(\theta) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where gravity points "downwards" and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle the pendulum forms with its rest position, as shown in the figure at right. One approach to "solving" this equation is to use &lt;math&gt;d\theta/dt&lt;/math&gt; as an [[integrating factor]], which would eventually yield
:&lt;math&gt;\int{\frac{d \theta}{\sqrt{C_0 + 2 \cos(\theta)}}} = t + C_1&lt;/math&gt;

which is an implicit solution involving an [[elliptic integral]]. This "solution" generally does not have many uses because most of the nature of the solution is hidden in the [[nonelementary integral]] (nonelementary unless &lt;math&gt;C_0 = 2&lt;/math&gt;).

Another way to approach the problem is to linearize any nonlinearities (the sine function term in this case) at the various points of interest through [[Taylor expansion]]s. For example, the linearization at &lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;, called the small angle approximation, is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 \theta}{d t^2} + \theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;

since &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta) \approx \theta&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\theta \approx 0&lt;/math&gt;. This is a [[simple harmonic oscillator]] corresponding to oscillations of the pendulum near the bottom of its path. Another linearization would be at &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to the pendulum being straight up:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 \theta}{d t^2} + \pi - \theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;

since &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta) \approx \pi - \theta&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\theta \approx \pi&lt;/math&gt;. The solution to this problem involves [[hyperbolic sinusoid]]s, and note that unlike the small angle approximation, this approximation is unstable, meaning that &lt;math&gt;|\theta|&lt;/math&gt; will usually grow without limit, though bounded solutions are possible. This corresponds to the difficulty of balancing a pendulum upright, it is literally an unstable state.

One more interesting linearization is possible around &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi/2&lt;/math&gt;, around which &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta) \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 \theta}{d t^2} + 1 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This corresponds to a free fall problem. A very useful qualitative picture of the pendulum's dynamics may be obtained by piecing together such linearizations, as seen in the figure at right. Other techniques may be used to find (exact) [[phase portrait]]s and approximate periods.

==Types of nonlinear dynamic behaviors==
*[[Amplitude death]] – any oscillations present in the system cease due to some kind of interaction with other system or feedback by the same system
*[[Chaos theory|Chaos]] – values of a system cannot be predicted indefinitely far into the future, and fluctuations are [[aperiodic]]
*[[Multistability]] – the presence of two or more stable states
*[[Soliton]]s – self-reinforcing solitary waves

An '''onion diagram''' is a kind of [[chart]] that shows the [[Dependency (project management)|dependencies]] among parts of an organization or process. The chart displays items in concentric circles, where the items in each ring depend on the items in the smaller rings.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Information==
The onion diagram is able to show layers of a complete system in a few circles. Each of the circles is able to represent a component that is dependent upon the component on the inside of it shown by the circle inside of it. The main concept of the diagram is shown by the center circle of the diagram. This chart is used due to the fact that it has a clear visual representation that is easy to read, and it has a strong visual impact.&lt;ref name=MicrosoftCorporation&gt;{{cite web|title=A quick introduction to block diagrams|url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio-help/a-quick-introduction-to-block-diagrams-RZ001133023.aspx?section=3|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EVAW&gt;{{cite web|title=Rainbow and onion diagrams|url=http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/1186-rainbow-and-onion-diagrams.html|publisher=End Violence Against Women|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
There is also the cultural onion which has seven layers to it including artifacts, behaviors, feelings, values, beliefs, worldview and ultimate allegiance. These layers organize a person's reality and life. The outer most layers are the most accessible while the in-depth ones are only accessible with connections to the person. The seven layers are integrated into three structural levels, which are the foundational, the evaluating, and the actualizing level.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2364">'''Ophelia complex''' is the term used by [[Gaston Bachelard]] to refer to the links between femininity, liquids, and drowning which he saw as symbolised in the fate of Shakespeare's [[Ophelia]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Thompson ed., ''Hamlet'' (Arden 2016) p. 26-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exteriorised adolescence==
A later, and unconnected use of the terms Ophelia complex/Ophelia syndrome was introduced by [[Mary Pipher]] in her ''[[Reviving Ophelia]]'' of 1994.

{{emotion}}

'''Panic''' is a sudden sensation of [[fear]], which is so strong as to dominate or prevent [[reason]] and [[logical]] thinking, replacing it with overwhelming feelings of [[anxiety]] and frantic [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]] consistent with an animalistic [[Fight-or-flight response|fight-or-flight]] reaction. Panic may occur singularly in individuals or manifest suddenly in large groups as [[mass panic]] (closely related to [[herd behavior]]).

== Etymology ==
The word derives from antiquity and is a tribute to the ancient god, [[Pan (god)|Pan]].  One of the many gods in the [[mythology]] of ancient Greece: Pan was the god of shepherds and of woods and pastures. The Greeks believed that he often wandered peacefully through the woods, playing a pipe, but when accidentally awakened from his noontime nap he could give a great shout that would cause flocks to stampede. From this aspect of Pan's nature Greek authors derived the word panikon, “sudden fear,” the ultimate source of the English word: "panic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Panic by Merriam-Webster|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/panic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
[[Human evolution#Before Homo|Prehistoric humans]] used mass panic as a technique when hunting animals, especially [[ruminant]]s. [[Herd]]s reacting to unusually strong sounds or unfamiliar visual effects were directed towards [[cliff]]s, where they eventually jumped to their deaths when cornered. [[Human]]s are also vulnerable to panic and it is often considered infectious, in the sense one person's panic may easily spread to other people nearby and soon the entire group acts [[Irrationality|irrational]]ly, but people also have the ability to prevent and/or control their own and others' panic by disciplined thinking or training (such as disaster drills). [[Architect]]s and [[city planner]]s try to accommodate the [[symptom]]s of panic, such as [[herd behavior]], during [[design]] and [[planning]], often using [[simulation]]s to determine the best way to lead people to a safe exit and prevent congestion ([[stampede]]s). The most effective methods are often non-intuitive. A tall column or columns, placed in front of the door exit at a precisely calculated distance, may speed up the evacuation of a large room, as the obstacle divides the congestion well ahead of the choke point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=TWAROGOWSKA|first1=M|last2=GOATIN|first2=P|last3=DUVIGNEAU|first3=R|title=MACROSCOPIC MODELING AND SIMULATIONS OF ROOM EVACUATION|arxiv=1308.1770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard J. Schmidt and Brooke Warner describe panic as “that terrible, profound emotion that stretches us beyond our ability to imagine any experience more horrible” adding that “physicians like to compare painful clinical conditions on some imagined ‘Richter scale’ of vicious, mean hurt … to the psychiatrist there is no more vicious, mean hurt than an exploding and personally disintegrating panic attack.”&lt;ref&gt;Leonard J. Schmidt and Brooke Warner (eds), ''Panic: Origins, Insight, and Treatment'' (Berkeley CA: North Atlantic Books, 2002), xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

An influential theoretical treatment of panic is found in [[Neil Smelser|Neil J. Smelser]]'s ''Theory of Collective Behavior''. The science of panic management has found important practical applications in the armed forces and emergency services of the world.

Many highly publicized cases of deadly panic occurred during massive public events. The layout of [[Mecca]] was extensively redesigned by [[Saudi]] authorities in an attempt to eliminate frequent stampedes, which kill an average of 250 [[pilgrim]]s every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3874">'''Phala''' is a [[Sanskrit]] term that means “fruit” of one's actions in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. In Buddhism, the following types of ''phala'' are identified:
* ''Ariya-phala'' also refers to the fruition of following the Buddhist path.
* ''Maha-phala'' refers the ''great fruits'' of the contemplative life.

==Within Hinduism==
In Hinduism, the term ''phala'' is translated as fruition, results, effects.&lt;ref name=yoga1&gt;[http://www.swamij.com/yoga-sutras-23545.htm Yoga Sutras 2.35-2.45]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yoga-Sûtra of Patañjali (verse 2.36) states:&lt;ref name=yoga1/&gt;
: As truthfulness (satya) is achieved, the fruits of actions naturally result according to the will of the Yogi. (satya pratisthayam kriya phala ashrayatvam)

==Within Buddhism==
Within Buddhism, the term ''phala'' is used to refer to the fruition or results of actions according to the doctrine of [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic action and result]].

===Alternate translations===
The term ''phala'' is translated as:
* fruit (Harvey, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;39;{{sfn|Peter Harvey|1990|p=39-40}} Keown, 2000, loc 810-813)
* fruition
* effect (Ven. D. Mahinda Thera&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metta.lk/english/buddhist-points.htm Buddhist Points Misunderstood], by Ven. D. Mahinda Thera&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Ariya-phala===
The term ''Ariya phala'' is used to refer specifically to the fruition of following the Buddhist path. The fruition for each of the four levels of the path is identified as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chezpaul.org.uk/buddhism/books/glossary.htm Glossary from "Oneness", by Ven. Ajahn Sanong Katapunyo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/glossary.html#phala A Glossary of Pali and Buddhist Terms]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Sota patti phala'', fruition of stream entry 
# ''Sakadagamiphala'', fruition of once returning
# ''Anagami phala'', fruition of non returning    
# ''Arahatta phala'', fruition of the worthy one  or perfected one

===Maha-phala===
The term ''Maha-phala'' refers to the ten "Great fruits" of the contemplative life. According to the ''Samaññaphala Sutta'', the 10 “Great fruits” (DN 2) are:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.greatwesternvehicle.org/pali/Phala_Nikaya/samannaphala.htm Samaññaphala Sutta (DN 2)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Equanimity (upekkha)
# Fearlessness (nibbhaya)
# Freedom from unhappiness &amp; suffering (Asukhacaadukkha)
# Meditative Absorption ([[jhana]]/[[samādhi]])
# [[Out-of-body experience]]  (Manomaya)
# [[Clairaudience]] (dibba-sota)
# Intuition and mental telepathy (ceto-pariya-ñána)
# Recollection of past lives (Patisandhi)
# [[Clairvoyance]] (dibba-cakkhu)
# End of anxiety &amp; mental agitation ([[nirvāna]])

==Comparison to Christianity==
The fruit (phala) of Buddhism and Hinduism are comparable the [[charism]]s of [[Charismatic Christianity]] which are known as the "sign-gifts” of the [[Holy Spirit]], which are the charisms of prophesy, healing, and [[speaking in tongues]], as described in the Christian Gospels 1 Corinthians 12.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8526">'''Photodegradation''' is the alteration of materials by light.  Typically, the term refers to the combined action of  [[sunlight]] and [[air]]. Photodegradation is usually [[oxidation]] and [[hydrolysis]].  Often photodegradation is avoided, since it destroys paintings and other artifacts. It is however partly responsible for remineralization of biomass and is used intentionally in some disinfection technologies. Photodegradation does not apply to how materials may be aged or degraded via [[infrared light]] or heat, but does include degradation in all of the [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]] wavebands.

==Applications==

===Foodstuffs===
The protection of food from photodegradation is very important. Some nutrients, like those found in [[beer]] for example, are affected by degradation when being exposed to sunlight. In the case of beer, the UV radiation causes a process, which entails the degradation of hop bitter compounds to 3-Methyl-2-buten-1-thiol and therefore changes the taste. As amber glass has the ability to absorb UV radiation, beer bottles are often made from this glass type to avoid this process.

=== Paints, inks and dyes ===
Paints, inks and dyes that are organic are more susceptible to photodegradation than those that are not. Ceramics are almost universally colored with non-organic origin materials so as to allow the material to resist photodegradation even under the most relentless conditions, maintaining its color.

===Pesticides and herbicides ===
The photodegradation of pesticides is of great interest because of the scale of agriculture and the intensive use of chemicals.  Pesticides are however selected in part not to photodegrade readily in sunlight in order to allow them to exert their biocidal activity.  Thus, additional modalities are implemented to enhance their photodegradation, including the use of photosensitizers, photocatalysts (e.g., [[titanium dioxide]]), and the addition of reagents such as [[hydrogen peroxide]] that would generate hydroxyl radicals that would attack the pesticides.&lt;ref name=burrows&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burrows|first1=H.D.|last2=Canle L|first2=M.|last3=Santaballa|first3=J.A.|last4=Steenken|first4=S.|title=Reaction pathways and mechanisms of photodegradation of pesticides|journal=Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology|date=June 2002|volume=67|issue=2|pages=71–108|doi=10.1016/S1011-1344(02)00277-4|hdl=10316/5187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmaceuticals===
The photodegradation of pharmaceuticals is of interest because they are found in many water supplies.  They have deleterious effects on aquatic organisms including toxicity, endocrine disruption, genetic damage.&lt;ref name=boreen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boreen|first1=Anne L.|last2=Arnold|first2=William A.|last3=McNeill|first3=Kristopher|title=Photodegradation of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment: A review|journal=Aquatic Sciences|date=1 December 2003|volume=65|issue=4|pages=320–341|doi=10.1007/s00027-003-0672-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; But also in the primary packaging material the photodegradation of pharmaceuticals has to be prevented. For this, amber [[glasses]] like [[Fiolax |Fiolax amber]] and Corning 51-L are commonly used to protect the pharmaceutical from UV radiations. Iodine (in the form of [[Lugol's solution]]) and collodial silver are universally used in packaging that lets through very little UV light so as to avoid degradation.

===Polymers===
{{main|Photo-oxidation of polymers}}
[[Image:Failedrope1.jpg|thumb|300px|Effect of UV exposure on [[polypropylene]] rope]]
Common synthetic polymers that can be attacked include [[polypropylene]] and [[LDPE]], where [[tertiary carbon]] bonds in their chain structures are the centres of attack. Ultraviolet rays interact with these bonds to form [[free radicals]], which then react further with [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere, producing [[carbonyl]] groups in the main chain. The exposed surfaces of products may then discolour and crack, and in extreme cases, complete product disintegration can occur. 

In fibre products like [[rope]] used in outdoor applications, product life will be low because the outer fibres will be attacked first, and will easily be damaged by [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] for example. Discolouration of the rope may also occur, thus giving an early warning of the problem. 

Polymers which possess UV-absorbing groups such as [[aromatic ring]]s may also be sensitive to UV degradation. [[Aramid]] fibres like [[Kevlar]], for example, are highly UV-sensitive and must be protected from the deleterious effects of sunlight.

==Mechanism==
[[File:Fotodegradazione secchio plastica usato come vaso da fiori.png|thumb|Photodegradation of a plastic bucket used as an open-air flowerpot for some years]]
Many organic chemicals are thermodynamically unstable in the presence of oxygen, however, their rate of spontaneous oxidation is slow at room temperature.  In the language of physical chemistry, such reactions are kinetically limited.  This kinetic stability allows the accumulation of complex environmental structures in the environment. Upon the absorption of light, triplet oxygen converts to [[singlet oxygen]], a highly reactive form of the gas, which effects spin-allowed oxidations.  In the atmosphere, the organic compounds are degraded by [[hydroxyl radical]]s, which are produced from water and ozone.&lt;ref name=Simmler&gt;Walter Simmler "Air, 6. Photochemical Degradation" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2011, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.&lt;/ref&gt;

Photochemical reactions are initiated by the absorption of a photon, typically in the wavelength range 290-700&amp;nbsp;nm (at the surface of the Earth).  The energy of an absorbed photon is transferred to electrons in the molecule and briefly changes their configuration (i.e., promotes the molecule from a [[ground state]] to an [[excited state]]).  The excited state represents what is essentially a new molecule.  Often excited state molecules are not kinetically stable in the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and can spontaneously decompose ([[oxidize]] or [[hydrolyze]]).  Sometimes molecules decompose to produce high energy, unstable fragments that can react with other molecules around them.  The two processes are collectively referred to as direct photolysis or indirect [[photolysis]], and both mechanisms contribute to the removal of pollutants.

The United States federal standard for testing plastic for photo-degradation is 40 CFR Ch. I (7–1–03 Edition)PART 238

==Protection against photodegradation==
Photodegradation of plastics and other materials can be inhibited with additives, which are widely used.  These additives include [[antioxidant]]s, which interrupt degradation processes.  Typical antioxidants are derivatives of [[aniline]].  Another type of additive are UV-absorbers.  These agents capture the photon and convert it to heat.  Typical UV-absorbers are hydroxy-substituted [[benzophenone]]s, related to the chemicals used in [[sunscreen]].&lt;ref name=Wolf&gt;Rainer Wolf, Bansi Lal Kaul "Plastics, Additives" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Planetary consciousness''' is the idea that human beings are members of a planetary society of [[Earth]] as much as they are members of their nations, provinces, districts, islands, cities or villages.

== History ==
In his 1906 book ''American Character'', author [[Brander Matthews]] mentions the idea of a "league of nations" and a "planetary consciousness", believing it would be created by American politicians in the coming centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=UA2WY1GvV-oC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=%22League+of+Nations%22+%22planetary+consciousness%22+-wikipedia#v=onepage&amp;q=%22League%20of%20Nations%22%20%22planetary%20consciousness%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false | author=Matthews, Brander | authorlink=Brander Matthews | title=American Character | page=187 | publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell &amp; Co |date=September 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Key planetary consciousness events of the 20th century include the creation of the [[League of Nations]], the signing of [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], the creation of the [[United Nations]], and the creation of the [[Bretton Woods system]].  [[Democratic globalization]] advocate [[Abhay Kumar]] points to the [[ICANN|International Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN) board of directors election in 2000, which were conducted globally, as the first example of global democracy.&lt;ref name=abhay&gt;{{cite news | title=Birth of Global Democracy | author=K, Abhay | authorlink=Abhay Kumar | work=[[Times of India]] | date=21 January 2011 | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-21/edit-page/28367706_1_printing-press-number-of-mobile-phones-gutenberg | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2001, [[Ervin László]] and the [[Dalai Lama]] wrote an essay titled "Manifesto on Planetary Consciousness", which was adopted at a meeting at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in Budapest.&lt;ref name=manifesto&gt;{{cite web | author1=László, Ervin | authorlink1=Ervin László | author2=[[Dalai Lama]] | title=Manifesto on Planetary Consciousness | publisher=WorldShift International | date=15 September 2001 | url=http://www.worldshiftinternational.org/manifesto-planetary-consciousness/ | accessdate=13 August 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828003626/http://www.worldshiftinternational.org/manifesto-planetary-consciousness/ | archivedate=28 August 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its introduction begins:

{{cquote|text=In the closing years of the twentieth century, we have reached a crucial juncture in our history. We are on the threshold of a new stage of social, spiritual, and cultural evolution, a stage that is as different from the stage of the earlier decades of this century as the grasslands were from the caves, and settled villages from life in nomadic tribes. We are evolving out of the nationally based industrial societies that were created at the dawn of the first industrial revolution, and heading toward an interconnected, information-based social, economic, and cultural system that straddles the globe.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;}}

[[Andreas Bummel]], CEO of the Committee for a Democratic UN, says, "The first step into the direction of a world parliament would be the establishment of a Parliamentary Assembly at the United Nations".&lt;ref name=bummel/&gt;

==Concept==
Advocacy for the idea of planetary consciousness is based on the technological advancements made by the mankind in the fields of transport and telecommunications during the 20th century and in the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; Kumar claims that these technological advancements have turned the whole planet into an interdependent economic, political and communication community.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; He specifically cites the invention of the Internet and the mobile phones as key technological achievements of the 20th century which brought humans into more continuous interconnected communication.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; He believes that these inventions will lead to a second [[Renaissance]] and global democracy, just as the [[Gutenberg press]] in 1439 led to the first Renaissance, the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and [[Nation state]]s.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt;  Bummel describes planetary consciousness as integral, insofar as it does not conflict with other levels of [[Identity (social science)|social identity]], but instead is a holistic perspective on humanity and the planet as a whole.&lt;ref name=bummel&gt;{{cite journal | title=Social Evolution, Global Governance and a World Parliament | author=Bummel, Andreas | journal=[[Cadmus (journal)|Cadmus]] | date=11 April 2012 |url=http://www.cadmusjournal.org/article/issue-4/social-evolution-global-governance-and-world-parliament#13 | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steven Kull writes that while nation states are reluctant to work cooperatively, individuals seem more willing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kull, Steven | title=Listening to the Voice of Humanity | journal= Kosmos Journal | issue=Spring/Summer | year= 2010 | pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Shashi Tharoor]] feels that an [[Earth Anthem]] sung by people across the world can inspire planetary consciousness and [[global citizenship]] among people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Indian-diplomat-pens-anthem-for-earth/2013/06/05/article1620381.ece Indian diplomat pens anthem for earth] The New Indian Express 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

}} ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "reconquest") is a name used in English to describe the period in the history of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] of about 780 years between the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] in 711 and the [[Granada War#Last stand at Granada|fall of the Nasrid kingdom of Granada]] to the expanding [[Christendom|Christian kingdoms]] in 1491. The completed [[Granada War|conquest of Granada]] was the context of the Spanish voyages of discovery and conquest (Columbus got royal support in Granada in 1492, months after its conquest), and the [[Americas]]—the "[[New World]]"—ushered in the era of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] colonial empires.

Traditional historiography has marked the beginning of the ''{{lang|es|Reconquista}}'' with the [[Battle of Covadonga]] (718 or 722), the first known victory in Iberia by Christian military forces since the 711 military intervention in Iberia of combined Arab-Berber forces. In that small battle, a group led by the nobleman [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]] defeated a Muslim patrol in the mountains of northern Iberia and established the independent Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. It ended with the conquest of the [[Emirate of Granada]], the last Muslim state in the peninsula, in 1491.

After 1491, the entire peninsula was controlled by Christian rulers. The conquest was followed by the [[Alhambra Decree]] (1492) which expelled Jews who would not convert to Christianity from Castile and Aragon, and a series of edicts (1499–1526) which [[Forced conversions of Muslims in Spain|forced the conversions of the Muslims in Spain]]. Since the mid-19th century, the idea of a 'reconquest' took hold in Spain associated with its rising [[nationalism]] and [[colonialism]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Concept and duration==
Traditional [[historiography]] has stressed since the 19th century the existence of the ''Reconquista'',&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=García Fitz|first1=Francisco|date=2009|title=La Reconquista: un estado de la cuestión|url=http://www.durango-udala.net/portalDurango/RecursosWeb/DOCUMENTOS/1/1_1945_3.pdf|journal=Clío &amp; Crímen: Revista del Centro de Historia del Crimen de Durango |language=es|volume=|issue=6|pages=142–215|doi=|issn=1698-4374}}&lt;/ref&gt; a continuous phenomenon by which the Christian Iberian kingdoms opposed and conquered the Muslim kingdoms, understood as a common enemy who had militarily seized territory from native Iberian Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain|last=O'Callaghan |first=Joseph F. |authorlink= Rosamond McKitterick |year= 2003 |publisher= University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia|isbn= 978-0812236965|page= 19|accessdate=February 15, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4gVIt5u0U5wC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of a Christian reconquest of the peninsula first emerged, in tenuous form, at the end of the 9th century.&lt;ref name=CambridgeMedieval&gt;{{cite book |title= The New Cambridge Medieval.

[[File:Almohad1200.png|thumb|The [[Islami]]c [[Almohad dynasty]] and surrounding states, including the Christian Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], and the [[Crown of Aragon]], c. 1200.]]

Both Christian and Muslim rulers fought amongst themselves. Alliances between Muslims and Christians were not uncommon.&lt;ref name=CambridgeMedieval/&gt; Blurring distinctions even further were the mercenaries from both sides who simply fought for whoever paid the most. The period is seen today to have had long episodes of relative religious tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;María Rosa Menocal, ''The Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain'', Back Bay Books, 2003, {{ISBN|0316168718}}, and see [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Crusades]], which started late in the 11–12th century, bred the religious ideology of a Christian reconquest, confronted at that time with a similarly staunch Muslim [[Jihad]] ideology in [[Al-Andalus]] by the [[Almoravids]], and to an even greater degree by the [[Almohads]]. In fact, previous documents from the 10th and 11th centuries are mute on any idea of "reconquest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Callaghan|first=Joseph F.|title=Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fPSBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=October 23, 2017|year=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-0306-6|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Propaganda accounts of Muslim-Christian hostility came into being to support that idea, most notably the ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'', a fictitious 11th-century French version of the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (778)]] dealing with the Iberian ''[[Saracen]]s'' (''Moors''), and taught as historical fact in the French educational system since 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title='Pagans are wrong and Christians are right': Alterity, Gender, and Nation in the ''Chanson de Roland''|last=Kinoshita|first=Sharon|journal=Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies|volume=31|issue=1|date=Winter 2001|pages=79–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DiVanna |first1=Isabel N. |year=2010 |title=Politicizing national literature: the scholarly debate around La Chanson de Roland in the nineteenth century |journal=Historical Research |volume=84 |issue=223 |pages=109–134 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2281.2009.00540.x |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern idea of the earlier concept of ''Reconquista'' is inextricably linked to the foundational myths of [[Spanish nationalism]] in the 19th century, and consolidated by the mid-20th century during [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s [[National-Catholicism|National-Catholic]] dictatorship, based on a strong underlying Castilian ideological element.&lt;ref name="García Fitz 2009, pp. 146-147"&gt;García Fitz, Francisco. 2009, pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of a "liberation war" of ''reconquest'' against the Muslims, depicted as foreigners, suited well the anti-Republican rebels during the [[Spanish Civil War]] who agitated for the banner of a Spanish fatherland threatened by regional nationalisms and communism.&lt;ref name="García Fitz 2009, pp. 146-147"/&gt; Their rebellious pursuit was thus a crusade for the restoration of the Church's unity, where Franco stood for both [[Pelagius of Asturias]] and [[El Cid]].&lt;ref name="García Fitz 2009, pp. 146-147"/&gt;

Some contemporary authors consider it proved that the process of Christian state-building in Iberia was indeed often defined by the reclamation of lands that had been lost to the [[Moors]] in generations past. In this way, state-building might be characterised—at least in ideological, if not practical, terms—as a process by which Iberian states were being 'rebuilt'.&lt;ref name="Purkis"&gt;{{cite book |title= Eleventh- and Twelfth-Century Perspectives on State Building in the Iberian Peninsula |last=Purkis |first=William J. |year= 2010 |publisher= University of Birmingham |pages= 57–58|accessdate=October 15, 2017|url=https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/GCMS/RMS-2010-05_W._J._Purkis,_Eleventh-_and_Twelfth-Century_Perspectives_on_State_Building_in_the_Iberian_Peninsula.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In turn, other recent historians dispute the whole concept of ''Reconquista'' as a concept created ''a posteriori'' in the service of later political goals. A few historians point out that Spain and Portugal did not previously exist as nations, and therefore the heirs of the Christian Visigothic Kingdom were not technically reconquering them, as the name suggests.&lt;ref&gt;Eugènia de Pagès, "''La 'Reconquista', allò que mai no va existir''", ''La Lamentable'', July 11, 2014, [http://lamentable.org/la-reconquista-allo-que-mai-no-va-existir/ lamentable.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martín M.

== Background ==
{{Further|Islam in Spain}}

===Islamic conquest of Christian Iberia===
{{Further|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Battle of Guadalete}}

In 711, Muslim [[Moors]], mainly North African [[Berber people|Berber]] soldiers with some [[Arab]]s, crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and began their conquest of the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania]]. After their conquest of the Visigothic Kingdom's Iberian territories, the Muslims crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and took control of [[Septimania]] in 719, the last province of the Visigothic Kingdom to be occupied. From their stronghold of [[Narbonne]], they launched raids into the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].

The invading Islamic armies did not exceed 60,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Richard|title=Moorish Spain|year=2006|publisher=Los Angeles: University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24840-3|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; These armies established an Islamic rule known as [[Al-Andalus]] that would last 300 years in much of the Iberian Peninsula and 770 years in [[Granada]].

===Islamic rule===
{{Main article|Berbers and Islam|Berber Revolt|}}

After the establishment of a local [[Emirate]], [[Caliph]] [[Al-Walid I]], ruler of the [[Umayyad|Umayyad caliphate]], removed many of the successful Muslim commanders. [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]], the first governor of the newly conquered province of Al-Andalus, was recalled to [[Damascus]] and replaced with Musa bin Nusair, who had been his former superior. Musa's son, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa, apparently married [[Egilona]], [[Roderic]]'s widow, and established his regional government in [[Seville]]. He was suspected of being under the influence of his wife and was accused of wanting to convert to Christianity and of planning a secessionist rebellion. Apparently a concerned Al-Walid I ordered Abd al-Aziz's assassination. Caliph Al-Walid I died in 715 and was succeeded by his brother [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]]. Sulayman seems to have punished the surviving Musa bin Nusair, who very soon died during a pilgrimage in 716. In the end, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa's cousin, [[Ayyub ibn Habib al-Lakhmi]] became the [[emir]] of ''Al-Andalus''.

The conquering generals were necessarily acting independently, due to the methods of communication available. Successful generals in the field and in a distant province would gain the personal loyalty of their officers and warriors and their ambitions were likely watched by certain circles of the distant government with a degree of concern and suspicion. Old rivalries and perhaps even full-fledged conspiracies between generals may have had influence over this development. In the end, the formerly successful generals were replaced by a younger generation considered more loyal to the government in Damascus.

A serious weakness amongst the Muslim conquerors was the ethnic tension between Berbers and Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Lowney]], ''A Vanished World: Muslims, Christians, and Jews in Medieval Spain'', (Oxford University Press, 2005), 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The Berbers were indigenous inhabitants of North Africa who had only recently converted to Islam; they provided most of the soldiery of the invading Islamic armies but sensed Arab discrimination against them.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Collins, ''Early Medieval Spain'', (St.Martin's Press, 1995), 164.&lt;/ref&gt; This latent internal conflict jeopardized Muslim unity.

After the Islamic Moorish conquest of most of the Iberian Peninsula in 711–718 and the establishment of the emirate of Al-Andalus, an Umayyad expedition suffered a major defeat at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] and was halted for a while on its way north. [[Odo of Aquitaine]] had married his daughter to [[Uthman ibn Naissa]], a rebel Berber and lord of [[Cerdanya]] (and, perhaps, contemporary Catalonia), in an attempt to secure his southern borders in order to fend off [[Charles Martel]]'s attacks on the north. However, a major [[punitive expedition]] led by [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]], the latest emir of Al-Andalus, defeated and killed Uthman, and the Muslim governor mustered an expedition north across the western Pyrenees, looted areas up to Bordeaux, and defeated Odo in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] in 732.

A desperate Odo turned to his archrival Charles Martel for help, who led the Frankish and remaining Aquitanian armies against the Umayyad armies and defeated them at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732, killing Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi. While Moorish rule began to recede, it would remain in parts of the Iberian peninsula for another 760 years.

==Reconquista==
=== Beginning of the ''Reconquista'' ===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Asturias}}
[[File:Escudo de Alcanadre-La Rioja.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Coat of arms of [[Alcanadre]]. [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], Spain. Depicting [[Maure|heads of slain Moors]]]]
The first victory in resistance to Muslim rule occurred in [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]] in 722. A drastic increase of taxes by the emir [[Anbasa ibn Suhaym Al-Kalbi]] provoked several rebellions in Al-Andalus, which a series of succeeding weak emirs were unable to suppress. Around 722, a Muslim military expedition was sent into the north in late summer to suppress a rebellion led by [[Pelagius of Asturias]] (Pelayo in Spanish, Pelayu in Asturian). Traditional historiography has hailed Pelagius' [[Battle of Covadonga|victory at Covadonga]] as the beginning of the ''Reconquista''. No Muslim source mentions the battle at Covadonga, in contrast with the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] in 721, with a death toll of perhaps tens of thousands, which was mourned for centuries as a large scale tragedy by the Iberian Muslims. For Pelagius, however, the Christian victory secured his independent rule, while the precise date and circumstances of the battle are unclear. Among the possibilities is that Pelagius' rebellion was successful because the greater part of the Muslim forces were focusing in [[Septimania]] and Toulouse (721).

Two northern realms, the Basque Navarre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Asturias, despite their small size, demonstrated an ability to maintain their independence. Because the Umayyad rulers based in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] were unable to extend their power over the Pyrenees, they decided to consolidate their power within the Iberian peninsula. Arab-Berber forces made periodic incursions deep into Asturias, but this area was a ''cul-de-sac'' on the fringes of the Islamic world fraught with inconveniences during campaigns and little interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It comes then as no surprise that, besides focusing on raiding the Arab-Berber strongholds of the Meseta, Alphonse I centred on expanding his domains at the expense of the neighbouring Galicians and Basques at either side of his realm just as much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|pages=156, 159}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first decades, Asturian control over part of the kingdom was weak, and for this reason it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances and war with other peoples from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. After Pelayo's death in 737, his son [[Favila of Asturias]] was elected king. Favila, according to the chronicles, was killed by a bear during a trial of courage. Pelayo's dynasty in Asturias survived and gradually expanded the kingdom's boundaries until all of northwest Iberia was included by roughly 775. However, credit is due not to him but to his successors, the ''Banu Alfons'' from the Arab chronicles. Further expansion of the northwestern kingdom towards the south occurred during the reign of Alfonso II (from 791–842). A king's expedition arrived in and pillaged Lisbon in 798, probably concerted with the Carolingians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Asturian kingdom became firmly established with the recognition of Alfonso II as king of Asturias by [[Charlemagne]] and the Pope. During his reign, the bones of [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James the Great]] were declared to have been found in Galicia, at [[Santiago de Compostela]]. Pilgrims from all over Europe opened a channel of communication between the isolated Asturias and the Carolingian lands and beyond, centuries later.

===Franks and Al-Andalus===
{{Main article|Islamic invasion of Gaul|Marca Hispanica}}

After the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian heartland of the Visigothic kingdom, the Muslims crossed the Pyrenees and gradually took control of [[Septimania]], starting in 719 with the conquest of [[Narbonne]] through 725 when [[Carcassone]] and [[Nîmes]] were secured. From the stronghold of Narbonne, they tried to conquer [[Aquitaine]] but suffered a major defeat at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)]].&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"&gt;{{cite book |title= 
The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718–1050|last=Lewis |first=Archibald R.|authorlink= Archibald Ross Lewis|year= 1965 |publisher= The University of Texas Press |location=|isbn= |pages=20–33|accessdate=October 28, 2017|url=http://libro.uca.edu/lewis/sfcatsoc.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years after halting their advance north, [[Odo of Aquitaine]] married his daughter to [[Uthman ibn Naissa]], a rebel Berber and lord of [[Cerdanya]] (perhaps all of contemporary Catalonia as well), in an attempt to secure his southern borders to fend off [[Charles Martel]]'s attacks on the north. However, a major [[punitive expedition]] led by [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]], the latest emir of Al-Andalus, defeated and killed Uthman.&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"/&gt;

==== Pepin the Younger and Charlemagne ====
After expelling the Muslims [[Siege of Narbonne (752-759)|from Narbonne in 759]] and driving their forces back over the Pyrenees, the Carolingian king [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|Pepin the Short conquered Aquitaine]] in a ruthless eight-year war. Charlemagne followed his father by subduing Aquitaine by creating counties, taking the Church as his ally and appointing counts of Frankish or Burgundian stock, like his loyal [[William of Gellone]], making [[Toulouse]] his base for expeditions against Al-Andalus.&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"/&gt; Charlemagne decided to organize a regional subkingdom in order to keep the Aquitanians in check and to secure the southern border of the [[Carolingian Empire]] against Muslim incursions. In 781, his three-year-old son [[Louis the Pious|Louis]] was crowned king of [[Aquitaine]], under the supervision of Charlemagne's trustee William of Gellone, and was nominally in charge of the incipient [[Spanish March]].&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 20-33"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the takeover of the southern fringes of Al-Andalus by Abd ar-Rahman I in 756 was opposed by [[Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri|Yusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman]], autonomous governor (''[[wāli]]'') or king (''malik'') of al-Andalus. Abd ar-Rahman I expelled Yusuf from Cordova,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|pages=118–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it took still decades for him to expand to the north-western Andalusian districts. He was also opposed externally by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] of Baghdad who failed in their attempts to overthrow him. In 778, Abd al-Rahman closed in on the Ebro valley. Regional lords saw the Umayyad emir at the gates and decided to enlist the nearby Christian Franks. According to [[Ali ibn al-Athir]], a Kurdish historian of the 12th century, Charlemagne received the envoys of [[Sulayman al-Arabi]], Husayn, and [[Abu Taur of Huesca|Abu Taur]] at the Diet of Paderborn in 777. These rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]], and [[Huesca]] were enemies of Abd ar-Rahman I, and in return for Frankish military aid against him offered their homage and allegiance.&lt;ref name="Collins, Roger 1989 177–181"&gt;{{cite book | author = Collins, Roger| year = 1989 | title = The Arab Conquest of Spain 710–797 | publisher = Blackwell |location = Oxford, UK / Cambridge, US|isbn= 978-0-631-19405-7|pages=177–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlemagne, seeing an opportunity, agreed upon an expedition and crossed the Pyrenees in 778. Near the city of [[Zaragoza]] Charlemagne received the homage of [[Sulayman al-Arabi]]. However the city, under the leadership of [[Husayn of Zaragoza|Husayn]], closed its gates and refused to submit.&lt;ref name="Collins, Roger 1989 177–181"/&gt; Unable to conquer the city by force, Charlemagne decided to retreat. On the way home the rearguard of the army was ambushed and destroyed by Basque forces at the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]. [[The Song of Roland]], a highly romanticized account of this battle, would later become one of the most famous [[Chanson de geste|chansons de geste]] of the Middle Ages. Around 788 Abd ar-Rahman I died and was succeeded by [[Hisham I of Córdoba|Hisham I]]. In 792 Hisham proclaimed a [[jihad]], advancing in 793 against the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and Carolingian [[Septimania|Septimania (Gothia)]]. They defeated William of Gellone, Count of Toulouse, in battle, but [[William of Gellone|William]] led an expedition the following year across the eastern Pyrenees. [[Barcelona]], a major city, became a potential target for the Franks in 797, as its governor Zeid rebelled against the Umayyad emir of Córdoba. An army of the emir managed to recapture it in 799, but Louis, at the head of an army, crossed the Pyrenees and besieged the city for two years until it finally capitulated in 801.&lt;ref name="Lewis AR 37-49"&gt;{{cite book |title=

The main passes in the Pyrenees were [[Roncesvalles]], [[Somport]] and [[La Jonquera]]. Charlemagne established across them the vassal regions of [[Pamplona]], [[Aragon]], and [[Catalonia]] respectively. Catalonia was itself formed from a number of [[Catalan counties|small counties]], including [[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[Girona (province)|Girona]], and [[Urgell]]; it was called the ''Marca Hispanica'' by the late 8th century. They protected the eastern Pyrenees passes and shores and were under the direct control of the Frankish kings. Pamplona's first king was [[Iñigo Arista]], who allied with his Muslim kinsmen the [[Banu Qasi]] and rebelled against Frankish overlordship and overcame a [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (824)|Carolingian expedition in 824]] that led to the setup of the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]]. Aragon, founded in 809 by [[Aznar Galíndez]], grew around [[Jaca]] and the high valleys of the [[Aragon River]], protecting the old Roman road. By the end of the 10th century, Aragon was annexed by Navarre. Sobrarbe and Ribagorza were small counties and had little significance to the progress of the ''Reconquista''.

In the late 9th century under [[Wilfred the Hairy, Count of Barcelona|Count Wilfred]], Barcelona became the ''de facto'' capital of the region. It controlled the other counties' policies in a union, which led in 948 to the independence of Barcelona under [[Borrell II, Count of Barcelona|Count Borrel II]], who declared that the new dynasty in France (the [[Capet]]s) were not the legitimate rulers of France nor, as a result, of his county. These states were small and, with the exception of Navarre, did not have the capacity for attacking the Muslims in the way that Asturias did, but their mountainous geography rendered them relatively safe from being conquered, and their borders remained stable for two centuries.

===Expansion into the Crusades and military orders===
[[File:Cantigas battle.jpg|thumb|A battle of the ''Reconquista'' from the ''[[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]'']]
In the [[High Middle Ages]], the fight against the Moors in the Iberian Peninsula became linked to the fight of the whole of [[Christendom]]. The ''Reconquista'' was originally a mere war of conquest. It only later underwent a significant shift in meaning toward a religiously justified war of liberation (see the Augustinian concept of a [[Just War]]). The [[papacy]] and the influential [[Abbey of Cluny]] in Burgundy not only justified the acts of war but actively encouraged Christian knights to seek armed confrontation with Moorish "infidels" instead of with each other.

From the 11th century onwards [[indulgences]] were granted: In 1064 [[Pope Alexander II]] promised the participants of [[War of Barbastro|an expedition against Barbastro]] (''Tagr al-Andalus'', Aragon) a collective indulgence 30 years before [[Pope Urban II]] called the [[First Crusade]]. Papal interest in Christian-Muslim relations in the peninsula was not without precedent&amp;nbsp;– Popes Leo IV (847–855), John VIII (872–882) and John XIX (1024–33) are all known to have displayed substantial interest in the region. Not until 1095 and the [[Council of Clermont]] did the ''Reconquista'' amalgamate the conflicting concepts of a peaceful pilgrimage and armed knight-errantry. But the papacy left no doubt about the heavenly reward for knights fighting for Christ (''militia Christi''): in a letter, Urban II tried to persuade the ''reconquistadores'' fighting at [[Tarragona]] to stay in the Peninsula rather than joining the armed pilgrimage to conquer Jerusalem, saying that their contribution for Christianity was equally important. The pope promised them the same indulgences that he had promised to those who chose to join the First Crusade.

Later [[Military order (society)|military orders]] such as the [[Order of Santiago]], [[Order of Montesa|Montesa]], [[Order of Calatrava]], and the [[Knights Templar]] were founded or called to fight in Iberia. The Popes called the knights of Europe to join the effort to destroy the Muslim states of the peninsula. After the so-called [[Battle of Alarcos|Disaster of Alarcos]], French, Navarrese, Castilian, Portuguese and Aragonese armies united against the Muslim forces in the massive ''[[battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]]'' (1212). The large territories awarded to military orders and nobles were the origin of the [[latifundia]] in today's [[Andalusia]] and [[Extremadura]] in Spain, and [[Alentejo]] in Portugal.

==Military culture in medieval Iberia==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}

In an atmosphere of constant conflict, warfare and daily life were strongly intertwined during this period. Small, lightly equipped armies reflected the need for society to be on constant alert. These forces were capable of moving long distances in short times, allowing a quick return home after sacking a target. Battles were mainly waged between clans, expelling intruder armies or sacking expeditions.

In the context of the relative isolation of the Iberian Peninsula from the rest of Europe, and the contact with Moorish culture, geographical and cultural differences necessitated the use of military strategies, tactics, and equipment that were markedly different from those found in the rest of western Europe during this period.

Medieval Iberian armies mainly comprised two types of forces: the cavalry (mostly nobles, but including commoner knights from the 10th century on) and the infantry, or ''peones'' (peasants). Infantry only went to war if needed, which was not frequent.

=== Cavalry and infantry ===
Iberian [[cavalry tactics]] involved knights approaching the enemy, throwing [[javelin]]s, then withdrawing to a safe distance before commencing another assault. Once the enemy formation was sufficiently weakened, the knights charged with thrusting [[spear]]s ([[lance]]s did not arrive in Hispania until the 11th century). There were three types of knights (''caballeros''): royal knights, noble knights (''caballeros [[Hidalgo (nobility)|hidalgos]]''), and commoner knights (''caballeros villanos'', or "mounted soldier from a [[Villa#Post-Roman era|villa]]"). Royal knights were mainly nobles with a close relationship with the king, and thus claimed a direct Gothic inheritance.

Royal knights were equipped in the same manner as their [[Goths|Gothic]] predecessors: mail [[hauberk]], kite shield, a long [[sword]] (designed to fight from the horse), javelins, spears and a [[francisca|Visigothic axe]]. Noble knights came from the ranks of the ''infanzones'' or lower nobles, whereas the commoner knights were not noble but were wealthy enough to afford a horse. Uniquely in Europe, these horsemen comprised a militia cavalry force with no feudal links, being under the sole control of the king or the count of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] because of ''[[fueros]]'' (charters) with the crown. Both noble and common knights wore padded armour and carried javelins, spears and round-tasselled shields (influenced by Moorish shields), as well as a sword.

The ''peones'' were [[peasants]] who went to battle in service of their [[feudal]] lord. Poorly equipped, with bows and arrows, spears and short swords, they were mainly used as auxiliary troops. Their function in battle was to contain the enemy troops until the cavalry arrived and to block the enemy infantry from charging the knights. The [[longbow]], the [[composite bow]], and the [[crossbow]] were the basic types of bows and were especially popular in the infantry.

Armour was typically made of leather, with iron scales; full coats of [[chain mail]] were extremely rare and horse [[barding]] completely unknown. Head protections consisted of a round helmet with nose protector (influenced by the designs used by [[Viking]]s, who attacked during the 8th and 9th centuries) and a chain mail headpiece. Shields were often round or kidney-shaped, except for the kite-shaped designs used by the royal knights. Usually adorned with geometric designs, crosses or tassels, shields were made out of wood and had a leather cover.

Steel swords were the most common weapon. The cavalry used long double-edged swords and the infantry short, single-edged ones. Guards were either semicircular or straight, but always highly ornamented with geometrical patterns. Spears and javelins were up to 1.5 metres long and had an iron tip. The double-axe – made of iron, 30&amp;nbsp;cm long, and possessing an extremely sharp edge – was designed to be equally useful as a thrown weapon or in close combat. Maces and hammers were not common, but some specimens have remained and are thought to have been used by members of the cavalry.

Finally, mercenaries were an important factor, as many kings did not have enough soldiers available. [[Norsemen]], [[Flemings|Flemish]] spearmen, Frankish knights, Moorish mounted archers, and Berber light cavalry were the main types of mercenaries available and used in the conflict.

=== Technological changes ===
This style of warfare remained dominant in the Iberian Peninsula until the late 11th century, when lance tactics entered from France, although the traditional horse javelin-shot techniques continued to be used. In the 12th and 13th centuries, soldiers typically carried a sword, a lance, a javelin, and either bow and arrows or crossbow and darts/bolts. Armor consisted of a coat of mail over a quilted jacket, extending at least to the knees, a helmet or iron cap, and bracers protecting the arms and thighs, either metal or leather.

Shields were round or triangular, made of wood, covered with leather, and protected by an iron band; the shields of knights and nobles would bear the family's coat of arms. Knights rode in both the Muslim style, ''a la jineta'' (i.e. the equivalent of a modern jockey's seat), a short stirrup strap and bended knees allowed for better control and speed, or in the French style, ''a la brida'', a long stirrup strap allowed for more security in the saddle (i.e. the equivalent of the modern cavalry seat, which is more secure) when acting as heavy cavalry. Horses were occasionally fitted with a coat of mail as well.

==Northern Christian realms==
The northern principalities and kingdoms survived in their mountainous strongholds (see above). However, they started a definite territorial expansion south at the turn of the 10th century (Leon, Najera). The fall of the Caliphate of Cordova (1031) heralded a period of military expansion for the northern kingdoms, now divided into several mighty regional powers after the division of the Kingdom of Navarre (1035). A myriad of autonomous Christian kingdoms emerged thereafter.

===Kingdom of Asturias (718–924)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Asturias}}
{{See also|Kingdom of Galicia}}
{{See also|Duchy of Cantabria}}
The Kingdom of Asturias was located in the [[Cantabrian Mountains]], a wet and mountainous region in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. It was the first Christian power to emerge. The kingdom was established by, [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]] (''Pelayo''), a [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic]] noble who had possibly returned after the Battle of Guadalete in 711 and was elected leader of the Asturians, laying the foundations for the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and starting the [[Astur-Leonese dynasty]] that spanned from 718 to 1037 and led the initial efforts in the Iberian peninsula to take back the territories then ruled by the Moors.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz De La Peña. La monarquia asturiana 718–910, p. 27. Cangas de Onís, 2000. {{ISBN|9788460630364}} / Fernández Conde. Estudios Sobre La Monarquía Asturiana, pp. 35–76. Estudios Históricos La Olmeda, 2015. {{ISBN|9788497048057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the new dynasty first ruled in the mountains of Asturias, with the capital of the kingdom established initially in [[Cangas de Onís]], and was in its dawn mostly concerned with securing the territory and settling the monarchy, the latest kings (particularly [[Alfonso III of Asturias]]) emphasized the nature of the new kingdom as heir of that in [[Visigothic Kingdom|Toledo]] and the restoration of the Visigothic nation in order to vindicate the expansion to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Casariego, J.E.: Crónicas de los reinos de Asturias y León. Biblioteca Universitaria Everest, León 1985, p. 68. {{ASIN|B00I78R3S4}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such claims have been overall dismissed by modern historiography, emphasizing the distinct, autochthonous nature of the Cantabro-Asturian and Vasconic domains with no continuation to the Gothic Kingdom of Toledo.&lt;ref&gt;García Fitz, Francisco. 2009, pp. 149–150&lt;/ref&gt;

Pelagius' kingdom initially was little more than a gathering point for the existing guerrilla forces. During the first decades, the Asturian dominion over the different areas of the kingdom was still lax, and for this reason it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances with other powerful families from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, Ermesinda, Pelagius' daughter, was married to [[Alfonso I of Asturias|Alfonso]], [[Duchy of Cantabria|Dux Peter of Cantabria]]'s son. Alfonso's son [[Fruela I of Asturias|Fruela]] married Munia, a Basque from [[Álava]], after crushing a Basque uprising (probably resistance). Their son is reported to be [[Alfonso II of Asturias|Alfonso II]], while Alfonso I's daughter Adosinda married Silo, a local chief from the area of Flavionavia, Pravia.

Alfonso's military strategy was typical of Iberian warfare at the time. Lacking the means needed for wholesale conquest of large territories, his tactics consisted of raids in the border regions of [[Vardulia]]. With the plunder he gained further military forces could be paid, enabling him to raid the Muslim cities of [[Lisbon]], [[Zamora (Spain)|Zamora]], and [[Coimbra]]. Alfonso I also expanded his realm westwards conquering [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].

[[File:Painting of Santiago Matamoros.jpg|thumb|[[James, son of Zebedee#Spain|St James the Great]], depicted as [[Saint James Matamoros|Santiago Matamoros]] (Santiago the Moor-slayer)]]

During the reign of [[Alfonso II of Asturias|King Alfonso II]] (791–842), the kingdom was firmly established, and a series of Muslim raids caused the transfer of the Asturian capital to [[Oviedo]]. The king is believed to have initiated diplomatic contacts with the kings of [[Pamplona]] and the [[Carolingian]]s, thereby gaining official recognition for his kingdom and his crown from the [[Pope]] and [[Charlemagne]].

The [[relic|bones]] of St. [[James the Great]] were proclaimed to have been found in Iria Flavia (present day [[Padrón]]) in 813 or probably two or three decades later. The cult of the saint was transferred later to [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]] (from Latin ''campus stellae'', literally "the star field"), possibly in the early 10th century when the focus of Asturian power moved from the mountains over to León, to become the [[Kingdom of León]] or Galicia-León. Santiago's were among many saint relics proclaimed to have been found across north-western Iberia. Pilgrims started to flow in from other Iberian Christian realms, sowing the seeds of the later [[Way of Saint James]] (11–12th century) that sparked the enthusiasm and religious zeal of continental [[Christian Europe]] for centuries.

Despite numerous battles, neither the Umayyads nor the Asturians had sufficient forces to secure control over these northern territories. Under the reign of [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiro]], famed for the highly legendary [[Battle of Clavijo]], the border began to slowly move southward and Asturian holdings in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], Galicia, and [[León (province)|León]] were fortified, and an intensive program of re-population of the countryside began in those territories. In 924 the Kingdom of Asturias became the [[Kingdom of León]], when León became the seat of the royal court (it didn't bear any official name).

===Kingdom of León (910–1230)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of León|Kingdom of Galicia|County of Portugal}}
[[Alfonso III of Asturias]] repopulated the strategically important city [[León, Spain|León]] and established it as his capital. King Alfonso began a series of campaigns to establish control over all the lands north of the [[Douro]] river. He reorganized his territories into the major duchies ([[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and Portugal) and major counties ([[Saldaña, Palencia|Saldaña]] and Castile), and fortified the borders with many castles. At his death in 910 the shift in regional power was completed as the kingdom became the [[Kingdom of León]]. From this power base, his heir [[Ordoño II of León|Ordoño II]] was able to organize attacks against [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and even [[Seville]].

The [[Caliphate of Córdoba]] was gaining power, and began to attack León. King Ordoño allied with Navarre against Abd-al-Rahman, but they were [[battle of Valdejunquera|defeated in Valdejunquera]] in 920. For the next 80 years, the Kingdom of León suffered civil wars, Moorish attack, internal intrigues and assassinations, and the partial independence of Galicia and Castile, thus delaying the reconquest and weakening the Christian forces. It was not until the following century that the Christians started to see their conquests as part of a long-term effort to restore the unity of the Visigothic kingdom.

The only point during this period when the situation became hopeful for León was the reign of [[Ramiro II of León|Ramiro II]]. King Ramiro, in alliance with [[Fernán González of Castile]] and his retinue of ''caballeros villanos'', [[battle of Simancas|defeated the Caliph in Simancas]] in 939. After this battle, when the Caliph barely escaped with his guard and the rest of the army was destroyed, King Ramiro obtained 12 years of peace, but he had to give González the independence of Castile as payment for his help in the battle. After this defeat, Moorish attacks abated until [[Almanzor]] began his campaigns. [[Alfonso V of León|Alfonso V]] finally regained control over his domains in 1002. Navarre, though attacked by Almanzor, remained intact.

The conquest of León did not include Galicia which was left to temporary independence after the withdrawal of the Leonese king. Galicia was conquered soon after (by Ferdinand, son of Sancho the Great, around 1038). However, this brief period of independence meant that Galicia remained a kingdom and fief of Leon, which is the reason it is part of Spain and not Portugal. Subsequent kings titled themselves kings of Galicia and León, instead of merely king of León as the two were united personally and not in union.

===Kingdom of Castile (1037–1230)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Castile}}
[[File:Alfonso VI reconquista Toledo.JPG|thumb|Ceramic of the conquest of Toledo by [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile|Alfonso VI]]]]
[[Ferdinand I of León]] was the leading king of the mid-11th century. He conquered [[Coimbra]] and attacked the [[taifa]] kingdoms, often demanding the tributes known as [[parias]]. Ferdinand's strategy was to continue to demand parias until the taifa was greatly weakened both militarily and financially. He also repopulated the Borders with numerous ''fueros''. Following the Navarrese tradition, on his death in 1064 he divided his kingdom between his sons. His son [[Sancho II of Castile]] wanted to reunite the kingdom of his father and attacked his brothers, with a young noble at his side: Rodrigo Díaz, later known as [[El Cid Campeador]]. Sancho was killed in the siege of [[Zamora (Spain)|Zamora]] by the traitor Bellido Dolfos (also known as Vellido Adolfo) in 1072. His brother [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alfonso VI]] took over León, Castile and Galicia.

Alfonso VI the Brave gave more power to the ''fueros'' and repopulated [[Segovia]], [[Ávila (province)|Ávila]] and [[Salamanca]]. Once he had secured the Borders, King Alfonso conquered the powerful [[Taifa of Toledo|Taifa kingdom of Toledo]] in 1085. [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], which was the former capital of the Visigoths, was a very important landmark, and the conquest made Alfonso renowned throughout the Christian world. However, this "conquest" was conducted rather gradually, and mostly peacefully, during the course of several decades. It was not until after sporadic and consistent population resettlements had taken place that Toledo was decisively conquered.

Alfonso VI was first and foremost a tactful monarch who chose to understand the kings of taifa and employed unprecedented diplomatic measures to attain political feats before considering the use of force. He adopted the title ''[[Imperator totius Hispaniae]]'' ("Emperor of all [[Hispania]]", referring to all the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, and not just the modern country of Spain). Alfonso's more aggressive policy towards the taifas worried the rulers of those kingdoms, who called on the African [[Almoravid]]s for help.

=== Kingdom of Navarre (824–1620) ===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Navarre}}
The [[Kingdom of Pamplona]] primarily extended along either side of the Pyrenees on the Atlantic Ocean. The kingdom was formed when local leader Íñigo Arista led a revolt against the regional Frankish authority and was elected or declared King in Pamplona (traditionally in 824), establishing a kingdom inextricably linked at this stage to their kinsmen, the [[muwallad]] [[Banu Qasi]] of Tudela.

Although relatively weak until the early 11th century, Pamplona took a more active role after the accession of [[Sancho III of Pamplona|Sancho the Great]] (1004–1035). The kingdom expanded greatly under his reign, as it absorbed Castile, Leon, and what was to be Aragon, in addition to other small counties that would unite and become the Principality of Catalonia. This expansion also led to the independence of Galicia, as well as gaining overlordship over [[Gascony]].

In the 12th century, however, the kingdom contracted to its core, and in 1162 King [[Sancho VI of Navarre|Sancho VI]] declared himself [[Kingdom of Navarre|king of Navarre]]. Throughout its early history, the Navarrese kingdom engaged in frequent skirmishes with the Carolingian Empire, from which it maintained its independence, a key feature of its history until 1513.

===Kingdom of Aragon (1035–1706)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Aragon|Crown of Aragon}}
[[File:Jaume I, Cantigas de Santa Maria, s.XIII.jpg|thumb|The Moors request permission from [[James I of Aragon]]]]

The Kingdom of Aragon started off as an offshoot of the Kingdom of Navarre. It was formed when [[Sancho III of Navarre]] decided to divide his large realm among all his sons. Aragon was the portion of the realm which passed to [[Ramiro I of Aragon]], an illegitimate son of Sancho III. The kingdoms of Aragon and Navarre were several times united in personal union until the death of [[Alfonso the Battler]] in 1135.

In 1137 the heiress of the kingdom married the [[count of Barcelona]], and their son [[Alfonso II of Aragon|Alfonso II]] ruled from 1162 the combined possessions of his parents, resulting in what modern historians call the [[Crown of Aragon]].

In the following centuries, the Crown of Aragon conquered a number of territories in the Iberian peninsula and the Mediterranean, including the [[kingdom of Valencia]] and the [[kingdom of Mallorca]]. [[James I of Aragon]], also known as James the Conqueror, expanded his territories to the north, south and east. James also signed the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)]], which released him from the nominal suzerainty of the King of France.

Early in his reign, James attempted to reunite the Aragonese and Navarrese crowns through a treaty with the childless [[Sancho VII of Navarre]]. But the Navarrese nobles rejected him, and chose [[Theobald IV of Champagne]] in his stead.

Later on, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], married [[Isabella of Castile]], leading to a dynastic union which eventually gave birth to modern [[Spain]], after the conquest of Upper [[kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] (Navarre south of the Pyrenees) and the [[kingdom of Granada]].

===Kingdom of Portugal (1139–1910)===
{{Main article|Kingdom of Portugal}}
[[File:GeraldoGeraldesSemPavor.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Statue of [[Gerald the Fearless]]. A Portuguese folk hero with the head of a Moor]]

In 1139, after an overwhelming victory in the [[Battle of Ourique]] against the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]], [[Afonso Henriques]] was proclaimed the first [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal]] by his troops. According to the legend, Christ announced from heaven{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Afonso's great deeds, whereby he would establish the first [[Portuguese Cortes]] at [[Lamego]] and be crowned by the [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] [[Archbishop of Braga]]. In the [[Treaty of Zamora]] in 1143, [[Alfonso VII of León and Castile]] recognized Portuguese independence from the Kingdom of León.

In 1147, Portugal [[Conquest of Santarém|captured Santarém]], and seven months later the city of [[Lisbon]] was also brought under Portuguese control after the [[Siege of Lisbon]]. By the papal bull [[Manifestis Probatum]], [[Pope Alexander III]] recognized Afonso Henriques as King of Portugal in 1179.

With [[Portugal]] finally recognized as an independent kingdom by its neighbours, [[Afonso Henriques]] and his successors, aided by [[Crusades|Crusaders]] and the military monastic orders the [[Knights Templar]], the [[Order of Aviz]] or the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword|Order of Saint James]], pushed the [[Moors]] to the [[Algarve]] on the southern coast of Portugal. After several campaigns, the Portuguese part in the ''Reconquista'' came to an end with the definitive capture of the Algarve in 1249. With all of Portugal now under the control of [[Afonso III of Portugal]], religious, cultural and ethnic groups became gradually homogenized.

[[File:OrderOfCristCross.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Cross of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]]]]

After the completion of the ''Reconquista'', the Portuguese territory was a Roman Catholic realm. Nonetheless, [[Denis of Portugal]] carried out a short war with [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] for possession of the towns of [[Serpa]] and [[Moura Municipality|Moura]]. After this, Denis avoided war; he signed the Treaty of Alcanizes with [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]] in 1297, establishing the present-day borders.

During the suppression of the Knights Templar all over [[Europe]], under the influence of [[Philip IV of France]] and [[Pope Clement V]] requesting its annihilation by 1312, King Denis reinstituted the Templars of [[Tomar]] as the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] in 1319. Denis believed that the Order's assets should by their nature stay in any given Order instead of being taken by the King, largely for the Templars' contribution to the ''Reconquista'' and the reconstruction of Portugal after the wars.

The experience gained during the battles of the ''Reconquista'' was fundamental to [[Conquest of Ceuta]],{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} the first step to the establishment of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Likewise, the contact with [[Islamic Golden Age|Muslim's navigation techniques and sciences]] enabled the creation of [[Portuguese Renaissance|Portuguese nautical innovations]] such as the [[caravel]] – the principal Portuguese ship during their voyages of exploration in the [[Age of Discovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobson|first1=John M.|title=The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation|date=2004|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521547246|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQN85hrJyT4C&amp;pg=PA141|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Minor Christian realms were the [[Kingdom of Viguera]] (970–1005), and the [[:es:Señorío de Valencia|Principality of Valencia]] (1094–1102).

==Christian infighting==
Clashes and raids on bordering Andalusian lands did not keep the Christian kingdoms from battling among themselves or allying with Muslim kings. Some Muslim kings had Christian-born wives or mothers.  Some Christian champions, like [[El Cid]], were contracted by [[taifa]] kings to fight against their neighbours. Indeed, [[El Cid]]'s first battle experience was gained fighting for a Muslim state against a Christian state. At the [[Battle of Graus]] in 1063, he and other Castilians fought on the side of [[Ahmad al-Muqtadir|al-Muqtadir]], Muslim [[sultan]] of [[Zaragoza]], against the forces of [[Ramiro I of Aragon]]. There is even an instance of a crusade being declared against another Christian king in Iberia.&lt;ref name="JosephCallaghan"&gt;Joseph O'Callaghan (2003). ''Reconquest and Crusade in Medieval Spain'', Philadelphia: University of Philadelphia Press. p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the disastrous defeat of [[Alfonso VIII]], King of Castile, at [[Battle of Alarcos|Alarcos]], Kings [[Alfonso IX]] of León and [[Sancho VII]] of Navarre entered an alliance with the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] and invaded Castile in 1196. By the end of the year Sancho VII had dropped out of the war under Papal pressure. Early in 1197, at the request of [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]], King of Portugal, Pope [[Celestine III]] declared a crusade against Alfonso IX and released his subjects from their responsibilities to the king, declaring that "the men of his realm shall be absolved from their fidelity and his dominion by authority of the apostolic see."&lt;ref name="JosephCallaghan" /&gt; Together the Kings of Portugal, Castile, and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] invaded León. In the face of this onslaught combined with pressure from the Pope, Alfonso IX was finally forced to sue for peace in October 1197.

In the late years of ''Al-Andalus'', Castile had the might to conquer the remnants of the kingdom of [[Granada]], but the kings preferred to claim the tribute of the Muslim ''[[parias]]''. The trade of Granadan goods and the parias were a major means by which African gold entered [[medieval Europe]].

==Christian repopulation of Iberian Peninsula==
{{Further|Medieval demography|Repoblación}}
The ''Reconquista'' was a process not only of war and conquest, but also of [[colonization|repopulation]]. Christian kings moved their own people to locations abandoned by Muslims in order to have a population capable of defending the borders. The main repopulation areas were the [[Douro]] Basin (the northern plateau), the high [[Ebro]] valley ([[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]) and central [[Catalonia]]. The repopulation of the [[Douro]] Basin took place in two distinct phases. North of the river, between the 9th and 10th centuries, the "pressure" (or ''presura'') system was employed. South of the [[Douro]], in the 10th and 11th centuries, the ''presura'' led to the "charters" (''[[foral|forais]]'' or ''[[fueros]]''). ''Fueros'' were used even south of the Central Range.

The ''presura'' referred to a group of peasants who crossed the mountains and settled in the abandoned lands of the Douro Basin. Asturian laws promoted this system, for instance granting a peasant all the land he was able to work and defend as his own property. Of course, Asturian and Galician minor nobles and clergymen sent their own expeditions with the peasants they maintained. This led to very feudalised areas, such as [[León (province)|León]] and Portugal, whereas Castile, an arid land with vast plains and harsh climate, only attracted peasants with no hope in Biscay. As a consequence, Castile was governed by a single count, but had a largely non-feudal territory with many [[wikt:freeman|free]] peasants. ''Presuras'' also appear in Catalonia, when the count of Barcelona ordered the Bishop of Urgell and the count of Gerona to repopulate the plains of [[Vic]].

During the 10th century and onwards, cities and towns gained more importance and power, as commerce reappeared and the population kept growing. ''[[Fuero]]s'' were [[charter]]s documenting the privileges and usages given to all the people repopulating a town. The ''fueros'' provided a means of escape from the [[feudal system]], as ''fueros'' were only granted by the monarch. As a result, the town council was dependent on the monarch alone and, in turn, was required to provide ''auxilium'' – aid or troops – for their monarch. The military force of the towns became the ''caballeros villanos''. The first ''fuero'' was given by count [[Fernán González]] to the inhabitants of [[Castrojeriz]] in the 940's. The most important towns of medieval Iberia had ''fueros'', or ''forais''. In Navarre, ''fueros'' were the main repopulating system. Later on, in the 12th century, Aragon also employed the system; for example, the ''fuero'' of [[Teruel]], which was one of the last fueros, in the early 13th century.

From the mid-13th century on, no more charters were granted, as the demographic pressure had disappeared and other means of re-population were created. ''Fueros'' remained as city charters until the 18th century in Aragon, Valencia and Catalonia and until the 19th century in Castile and Navarre. ''Fueros'' had an immense importance for those living under them, who were prepared to go to war to defend their rights under the charter. In the 19th century, the abolition of the ''fueros'' in Navarre would be one of the causes of the [[Carlist Wars]]. In Castile, disputes over the system contributed to the war against Charles I ([[Castilian War of the Communities]]).

==Muslim decline and defeat==

===Fall of the Caliphate===
[[File:Batalla del Puig por Marzal de Sas (1410-20).jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of the Puig]] at [[El Puig|El Puig de Santa Maria]] in 1237]]

During the 9th century the Berbers returned to North Africa in the aftermath of revolts. Many governors of large cities distant from the capital, Córdoba, had planned to establish their independence. Then, in 929, the [[Emir of Córdoba]] ([[Abd-ar-Rahman III]]), the leader of the Umayyad dynasty, declared himself [[Caliph]], independent from the [[Abbasid]]s in [[Baghdad]]. He took all the military, religious, and political power and reorganised the army and the bureaucracy.

After regaining control over the dissident governors, Abd-ar-Rahman III tried to conquer the remaining Christian kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula, attacking them several times and forcing them back beyond the [[Cantabrian Mountains]]. Abd-ar-Rahman's grandson later became a puppet in the hands of the great [[Vizier]] [[Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir|Almanzor]] (''al-Mansur'', "the victorious"). Almanzor waged several campaigns attacking and sacking [[Burgos]], León, [[Pamplona]], [[Barcelona]], and [[Santiago de Compostela]] before his death in 1002.

Between Almanzor's death and 1031, Al-Andalus suffered many civil wars, which ended in the division into the [[Taifa|Taifa kingdoms]]. The taifas were small kingdoms, established by the city governors. The result was many (up to 34) small kingdoms, each centered upon its capital. Their governors had no larger-scale vision of the Moorish presence in the Iberian peninsula and had no qualms about attacking their neighbouring kingdoms whenever they could gain advantage by doing so.

The split into the taifa states weakened the Islamic presence, and the Christian kingdoms further advanced as [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] conquered [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in 1085. Surrounded by enemies, taifa rulers sent a desperate appeal to the Berber chieftain [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], leader of the Almoravids.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Almoravids===
{{Main article|Almoravid dynasty}}
[[File:Mapa reconquista almohades-en.svg|thumb|Extent of the ''Reconquista'' into Almohad territory as of 1157.]]
[[File:Capture de Séville par Ferdinand III.jpg|thumb|Capture of Seville by [[Ferdinand III of Castile]] (painted by [[Francisco Pacheco]])]]
The [[Almoravid]]s were a Muslim militia primarily composed of Berber and [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] Moors, and unlike previous Muslim rulers, they were not so tolerant towards Christians and Jews. Their armies entered the Iberian peninsula on several occasions (1086, 1088, 1093) and defeated King Alfonso at the [[Battle of Sagrajas]] in 1086, but initially their purpose was to unite all the taifas into a single Almoravid Caliphate. Their actions halted the southward expansion of the Christian kingdoms. Their only defeat came at [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] in 1094, due to the actions of [[El Cid]].

Meanwhile, Navarre lost all importance under King [[Sancho IV of Navarre|Sancho IV]], for he lost Rioja to [[Sancho II of Castile]], and nearly became the vassal of Aragon. At his death, the Navarrese chose as their king [[Sancho Ramírez]], King of Aragon, who thus became Sancho V of Navarre and I of Aragon. Sancho Ramírez gained international recognition for Aragon, uniting it with Navarre and expanding the borders south, conquering ''Wasqa&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'' [[Huesca]] deep in the valleys in 1096 and building a fort, El Castellar, 25&amp;nbsp;km from ''Saraqusta&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;'' [[Zaragoza]].

Catalonia came under intense pressure from the taifas of Zaragoza and [[Taifa of Lérida|Lérida]], as well as from internal disputes, as Barcelona suffered a dynastic crisis that led to open war among the smaller counties.  But by the 1080s, the situation had calmed down, and the dominion of Barcelona over the smaller counties was restored.

===Almohads===
{{Main article|Almohad dynasty}}
[[File:La Rendición de Granada - Pradilla.jpg|thumb|''The Surrender of Granada'' by [[Francisco Pradilla Ortiz]]]]
After a brief period of disintegration (the second [[Taifa]] period), the Almohads, the rising power in North Africa, took over most of ''Al-Andalus''. However they were decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] (1212) by a Christian coalition, losing almost all the remaining lands of ''Al-Andalus'' in the following decades. By 1252 only the [[Kingdom of Granada]] remained intact but as a vassal state of Castile.

===Granada War and the end of Muslim rule in Iberia===
{{Main article|Granada War|Treaty of Granada (1491)}}
[[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]] completed the ''Reconquista'' with a war against the [[Emirate of Granada]] that started in 1482 and ended with Granada's surrender on January 2, 1492. The Moors in Castile previously numbered "half a million within the realm." By 1492 some 100,000 had died or been enslaved, 200,000 had emigrated, and 200,000 remained in Castile. Many of the Muslim elite, including Granada's former Emir Muhammad XII, who had been given the area of the [[Alpujarras]] mountains as a principality, found life under Christian rule intolerable and emigrated to [[Tlemcen]] in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Kamen, Henry.

In 1497 Spanish forces took [[Melilla]], west of Oran, and the island of [[Djerba]], south of Tunis, and went on to more important gains, with the bloody [[Spanish conquest of Oran (1509)|seizure of Oran in 1509]], and the capture of [[Bougie]] and [[Spanish conquest of Tripoli (1510)|Tripoli in 1510]]. The Spanish capture of [[Tripoli]] cost them some 300 men, while the inhabitants suffered between 3,000 and 5,000 killed and another 5,000–6,000 carried off as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Last Great Muslim Empires|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, however, they faced competition from the rapidly expanding [[Ottoman Empire]] in the east and were pushed back.

==Conversions and expulsions==

As elsewhere in the Muslim world, Christians and Jews were allowed to retain their religions, with their own legal systems and courts, by paying a tax, the ''[[jizya]]''. The penalty for not paying it was imprisonment.

The new Christian hierarchy demanded heavy taxes from non-Christians and gave them rights, such as in the [[Treaty of Granada (1491)]] only for Moors in recently Islamic Granada. On July 30, 1492, all the Jewish community – some 200,000 people – were forcibly expelled.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/expulsion.html "Modern Jewish History: The Spanish Expulsion (1492)"], ''The Jewish Virtual Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year the [[Alhambra decree]] ordered the expulsion of practicing Jews, leading many to convert to Catholicism. In 1502, Queen Isabella I declared conversion to Catholicism compulsory within the Kingdom of Castile. King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] did the same to Moors in the Kingdom of Aragon in 1526, forcing conversions of its Muslim population during the [[Revolt of the Germanies]].&lt;ref name = "Tofiño"&gt;[http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/ciberletras/v06/tofino.html Censorship and Book Production in Spain During the Age of the Incunabula], Ignacio Tofiño-Quesada.

=== Spanish Inquisition ===
{{Main article|Spanish Inquisition}}

Most of the descendants of those Muslims who submitted to conversion to Christianity – rather than exile – during the early periods of the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition, the Moriscos, were later [[Expulsion of the Moriscos|expelled from Spain]] after serious social upheaval, when the Inquisition was at its height. The expulsions were carried out more severely in eastern Spain (Valencia and Aragon) due to local animosity towards Muslims and Moriscos where they were seen as economic rivals by local workers who saw them as cheap labor undermining their bargaining position with the landlords. Exactions imposed on the Moriscos paved the way to a major [[Morisco revolt]] happening in 1568, with the final [[expulsion of the Moriscos]] from [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] taking place in 1609; they were driven from [[Aragon]] at about the same time.

Making things more complex were the many former Muslims and Jews known as ''[[Morisco]]s'', ''[[Marrano]]s'', and ''[[Converso]]s'', who shared ancestors in common with many Christians, especially among the aristocracy, causing much concern over loyalty and attempts by the aristocracy to hide their non-Christian ancestry. Some – the numbers are debated – continued to secretly practice their religions and use their languages well into the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Nevertheless, all those deemed to be "New Christians" were repeatedly suspected of illegally continuing in secret to practice their religions various [[treason|crimes against the Spanish state]] including continued practice of Islam or Judaism. New Christians were subject to many discriminatory practices starting in the sixteenth century.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Classifications and later consequences==
[[File:Pedro Berruguete Saint Dominic Presiding over an Auto-da-fe 1495.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Dominic]] presiding over an ''auto-da-fé'', by [[Pedro Berruguete]] (around 1495)&lt;ref name="Prado"&gt;* [http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/saint-dominic-presides-over-an-auto-da-fe/] at [[Museo del Prado|Prado Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The many advances and retreats created several social types:
*The ''[[Muladi]]'': Christians under Islamic rule who converted to Islam after the arrival of the Berbers.
*The ''[[Mozarab]]s'': Christians in Muslim-held lands. Some of them migrated to the north of the peninsula in times of persecution bringing elements of the styles, food and agricultural practices learned from the Andalusians, while they continued practicing their Christianity with older forms of Catholic worship and their own versions of the [[Latin]] language.
*"[[New Christians]]", Jews converting to Christianity called ''[[conversos]]'', or pejoratively ''[[Marrano]]s''. Jews converted to Christianity voluntarily or through force. Some were [[Crypto-Jews]] who continued practicing [[Judaism]] secretly. All remaining Jews were expelled from Spain as a consequence of the 1492 [[Alhambra Decree]], and from Portugal in 1497. Former Jews, known as ''Conversos'' (''the converted''), were subject to the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s, established to enforce Christian faith and practice, which often resulted in secret investigations and public punishments of ''conversos'' in [[auto-da-fé]]s ("acts of faith"), often public executions by burning the victim alive.
*The ''[[Mudéjar]]'' : Muslims in Christian-held lands.
* ''[[Morisco]]s'': Muslim ''[[converso]]s''. Muslims who were forced to convert to Catholicism. A significant number were Crypto-Muslims who continued practicing Islam secretly. They ranged from successful skilled artisans, valued and protected in Aragon, to impoverished peasants in Castile. After the [[Alhambra Decree]] the entire Islamic population was forced to convert or leave, and at the beginning of the seventeenth century a significant number were expelled in the [[Expulsion of the Moriscos]].

==Legacy==
{{See also|History of Spain|History of Portugal|Portugal in the period of discoveries}}

Real, legendary, and fictional episodes from the ''Reconquista'' are the subject of much of medieval [[Galician-Portuguese]], [[Spanish literature|Spanish]], and [[Catalan literature]] such as the ''[[cantar de gesta]]''.

Some noble [[genealogy|genealogies]] show the close relations (although not very numerous) between Muslims and Christians. For example, [[Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir]], whose rule is considered to have marked the peak of power for Moorish ''Al-Andalus'' Iberia, married Abda, daughter of [[Sancho II of Navarra|Sancho Garcés II]] of [[Navarra]], who bore him a son, named Abd al-Rahman and commonly known in pejorative sense as [[Sanchuelo]] (''Little Sancho''; in Arabic: ''Shanjoul'').

After his father's death, Sanchuelo/Abd al-Rahman, as a son of a Christian princess, was a strong contender to take over the ultimate power in Muslim al-Andalus. A hundred years later, King [[Alfonso VI of Castile]], considered among the greatest of the Medieval Spanish kings, designated as his heir his son (also a Sancho) by the refugee [[Muslim]] princess [[Zaida of Seville]].

The ''Reconquista'' was a war with long periods of respite between the adversaries, partly for pragmatic reasons and also due to infighting among the Christian kingdoms of the North spanning over seven centuries. Some populations practiced Islam or Christianity as their own religion during these centuries, so the identity of contenders changed over time.

===Festivals in modern Spain===
Currently, festivals called ''[[moros y cristianos]]'' (Castilian), ''moros i cristians'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]), ''mouros e cristãos'' (Portuguese) and ''mouros e cristiáns'' (Galician), which all mean "Moors and Christians", recreate the fights as colorful parades with elaborate garments and lots of fireworks, especially on the central and southern towns of the [[Land of Valencia]], like [[Alcoi]], [[Ontinyent]] or [[Villena]].

=== Persistent effects ===
A 2016 study found that the manner of the Reconquest has persistent effects on the Spanish economy to this day.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oto-Peralías|first=Daniel|last2=Romero-Ávila|first2=Diego|date=May 13, 2016|title=The economic consequences of the Spanish Reconquest: the long-term effects of Medieval conquest and colonization|journal=Journal of Economic Growth|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=409–464|doi=10.1007/s10887-016-9132-9|issn=1381-4338|hdl=10023/10769}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors show how territory quickly re-taken during the Reconquest was given to nobility, whereas territory slowly re-taken was more equally distributed and settled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lands dominated by nobility have worse long-term development outcomes and greater inequality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Reverberations===

On the conclusion of Iberian victory over the Moors, the Iberian powers, Spain and Portugal didn't stop their warring against the Muslims solely in their homelands—they extended the conflict against Islam overseas. The Spanish under the Hapsburg dynasty soon became the champions of Roman Catholicism in Europe and the Mediterranean against the encroaching threat of the [[Ottoman-Hapsburg Wars|Ottoman Caliphate]]. In a similar vein, the Portuguese also extended the Reconquista, this time against Muslim states overseas. The [[conquest of Ceuta]] marked the beginning of Portuguese expansion into Muslim Africa. Soon, the Portuguese also [[Ottoman–Portuguese conflicts|went into conflict with the Ottoman Caliphate]] in the [[Portuguese expedition to Otranto|Mediterranean]]&lt;ref&gt;proficiscitur Hydruntum classis quam ex Portugallia accersivimus. . .

'''Sal Restivo''' (born 1940) is a sociologist/anthropologist. 

==Work==
Restivo is a leading contributor to [[science studies]] and in particular to the [[sociology]] of mathematical knowledge. His current work focuses on the sociology of mind and brain, and the sociology of god and religion.  He has also done work in the sociology of social and sociable robotics. He helped launch the ethnographic study of science in the 1970s, and is a founding member (1975) and former president (1994/95) of the Society for Social Studies of Science. He was a founding member of the Association for Humanist Sociology, and was also involved with Science for the People in its formative years and active in the Radical Science Movement.  His pioneering work in the sociology of mathematics has been a key factor in bringing [[social constructionism]] into mathematics education and the philosophy of mathematics education. He also helped to develop the [[science and technology studies]] curriculum which has become a popular major at universities throughout the US and the world. He is based in the USA and worked as a professor for many years at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], [[Troy, NY]]. He has been awarded multiple NSF and NEH grants and fellowships as well as support from other agencies.  He has been a Nordisk Forskerutdanningsakademi Professor simultaneously at Roskilde University (Denmark) and the University of Gothenburg (Sweden); a Belgian National Research Foundation Professor, Free University of Brussels (Belgium); and a Special Professor of Mathematics Education at Nottingham University (United Kingdom). He is a former Hixon/Riggs Professor of Science, Technology, and Society at Harvey Mudd College, and currently holds the title of Special Lecture Professor at the Research Institute for the Philosophy of Science and Technology at Northeastern University in Shenyang, China.  At RPI, he was Professor of Sociology, Science Studies, and Information Technology. He retired from RPI on June 30, 2012 and then spent six months as a Senior Fellow at the University of Ghent in Belgium. He is now living in Ridgewood, NY and taught in the Department of Technology, Culture, and Society at [[New York University Tandon School of Engineering]] in Brooklyn NY from 2015-2017.  He attended and graduated from [[Brooklyn Technical High School]] with honors in electrical engineering &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bths.edu/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=228863&amp;type=d&amp;termREC_ID=&amp;pREC_ID=444385&lt;/ref&gt;; earned his BA with honors at the [[City College of New York]]. He has a PhD earned with distinction from [[Michigan State University]]&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.rpi.edu/node/36079{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43342">'''Self-categorization theory''' is a theory in [[social psychology]] that describes the circumstances under which a person will perceive collections of people (including themselves) as a group, as well as the consequences of perceiving people in group terms.&lt;ref name="Haslam (1997)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haslam|first=S.

C. &amp; Reynolds, K. J. (2010)"&gt;Turner, J. C. &amp; Reynolds, K. J. (2010). The story of social identity. In T. Postmes &amp; N. Branscombe (Eds). Rediscovering Social Identity: Core Sources. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; self-categorization theory assumes that the self can be categorized at various levels of abstraction. In other words, humans may categorize the self as a singular “I”(personal identity), or as a more inclusive “we”(social identity). In the latter case the self is cognitively grouped as identical and interchangeable to other stimuli within that category.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt; It is argued that it is this variation in self categorization that underpins many intergroup phenomenon,&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt; including those described in social identity theory.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt;

To demonstrate the notion of varying [[Principle of abstraction|levels of abstraction]] and inclusiveness, three types of self category are often given as examples.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt; The lowest level of abstraction is given as a personal self, where the perceiver self categorizes as “I”. A higher level of abstraction corresponds to a social self, where the perceiver self categorizes as “we” in comparison to a salient outgroup (them). A highest level of abstraction is represented by ''we humans'', where the salient outgroup is animals or other non-humans. A common misconception is that these three example categories represent ''the'' self categories that humans use. Instead, the theory posits that there are innumerable self categories that a perceiver may use (see, [[Self-categorization theory#Online category formation|online category formation]]), and in particular that there are a myriad of different personal and social identities that a perceiver may invoke in his or her day-to-day life.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Onorato (1998)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reynolds &amp; Turner (2006)."/&gt; The misconception may also be attributable to the early writing of Turner where a singular social identity was contrasted against a singular personal identity.&lt;ref name="Turner (1982)"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Turner| first1=J.C.| editor-last  =Tajfel| editor-first =H.| year=1982| title=Toward a cognitive redefinition of the social group| journal=Social Identity and Intergroup Relations| pages=15–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; This however predates the formal statement of self-categorization theory.

====Accentuation====
In self-categorization theory, categorizing people does not simply involve the redescription of characteristics and categories present in social stimuli. Rather, salient ''social categories'' form the basis of a social world that is enriched with meaning. This is achieved through a non-conscious process of accentuation, where ''differences between'' social categories are accentuated along with the ''similarities within''  social categories.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1995)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haslam | first1 = S. A. | last2 = Oakes | first2 = P. J. | last3 = Turner | first3 = J. C. | last4 = McGarty | first4 = C. | year = 1995 | title = Social categorization and group homogeneity: Changes in the perceived applicability of stereotype content as a function of comparative context and trait favourableness | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 139–160 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-8309.1995.tb01054.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting augmentation of social content allows the perceiver to interact with others with greater confidence and ease.

The accentuation component of self-categorization theory stems from prior research that demonstrated an [[accentuation effect]] for categorized non-social stimuli.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. &amp; Reynolds, K. J. (2010)"/&gt; A prototypical example of non-social accentuation came from Tajfel and Wilkes, who found that when a categorization scheme corresponded to line length participants would view lines belonging to different categories as more different than if no categorization scheme was present.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Wilkes (1963)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tajfel|first1=H.|last2=Wilkes|first2=A. L.|title=Classification and quantitative judgement|journal=British Journal of Psychology|year=1963|volume=54|issue=2|pages=101–114|pmid=13980241|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1963.tb00865.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the idea that an efficient cognitive system would, where possible, use the same systems regardless of the social or non-social nature of the stimuli,&lt;ref name="Van rooy et al. (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Rooy | first1 = D. | last2 = Van Overwalle | first2 = F. | last3 = Vanhoomissen | first3 = T. | last4 = Labiouse | first4 = C. | last5 = French | first5 = R. | year = 2003 | title = A recurrent connectionist model of group biases | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 110 | issue = 3| pages = 536–563 | pmid = 12885114 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.110.3.536| citeseerx = 10.1.1.72.3496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; self-categorization theorists have demonstrated similar effects for social stimuli. For example, Haslam and Turner found that a perceiver would describe another person as more or less similar to themselves as a function of the likely categorization scheme.&lt;ref name="Haslam &amp; Turner (1992)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haslam | first1 = Alex | last2 = Turner | first2 = John | year = 1992 | title = Context-dependent variation in social stereotyping 2: The relationship between frame of reference, self-categorization and accentuation. | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology| volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 251–277 | doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420220305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depersonalization and self-stereotyping ===
According to self-categorization theory, depersonalization describes a process of [[Self-Stereotyping|self-stereotyping]]. This is where, under conditions of social category [[Self-categorization theory#Determinants of categorization|salience]] and consequent accentuation, “people come to see themselves more as the interchangeable exemplars of a social category than as unique personalities defined by their differences from others”.&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt; Under these conditions a perceiver directly bases their behaviour and beliefs on the [[norm (social)|norms]], goals and needs of a salient ingroup.&lt;ref name="Haslam, et al. (2011)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown, R. J. &amp; Turner, J. C. (1981)."&gt;Brown, R. J. &amp; Turner, J. C. (1981). Interpersonal and intergroup behaviour. In J. C. Turner &amp; H. Giles (Eds.), Intergroup Behaviour (pp. 33-65). Oxford: Blackwell..&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a person's salient self-category becomes 'army officer' then that person is more likely to act in terms of the norms associated with that category (e.g. to wear a uniform, follow orders, and distrust an enemy) and less likely to act in terms of other potential self-categories.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt; Here the person can be said to be accentuating the similarities between his or herself and other members of the 'army officers' category.

Turner and colleagues stress that depersonalization is not a loss of self, but rather a ''redefinition'' of the self in terms of group membership.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt; A depersonalized self, or a social identity, is every bit as valid and meaningful as a personalized self, or personal identity.&lt;ref name="Haslam, et al. (2011)."/&gt; A loss of self is sometimes referred to using the alternative term [[deindividuation]]. Further, although the term [[depersonalization]] has been used in [[clinical psychology]] to describe a type of disordered experience, this is completely different from depersonalization in the sense intended by self-categorization theory authors.

The concept of depersonalization is critical to a range of group phenomena including social influence, social [[Stereotype|stereotyping]], in-group [[cohesiveness]], [[ethnocentrism]], intragroup [[cooperation]], [[altruism]], emotional [[empathy]], and the emergence of [[Norm (social)|social norms]].&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;

===Determinants of categorization===
In self-categorization theory the formation and use of a social category in a certain context is predicted by an interaction between [[Self-categorization theory#Perceiver readiness|perceiver readiness]] and category-stimulus  fit. The latter being broken down into [[Self-categorization theory#Comparative fit|comparative fit]] and [[Self-categorization theory#Normative fit|normative fit]].&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voci|first=Alberto|title=Relevance of social categories, depersonalization and group processes: two field tests of self-categorization theory|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=1 January 2006|volume=36|issue=1|pages=73–90|doi=10.1002/ejsp.259}}&lt;/ref&gt; This predictive interaction was heavily influenced by [[Jerome Bruner|Bruner’s]] accessibility and fit formula.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. &amp; Reynolds, K. J. (2010)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruner (1957)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bruner | first1 = J. S. | year = 1957 | title = On perceptual readiness | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 123–152 | pmid = 13420288 | doi=10.1037/h0043805}}&lt;/ref&gt; A social category that is currently in use is called a ''salient'' social category, and in the case of a self category is called a ''salient social identity''.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt; The latter should not be confused with ''level of identification'', which is a component of perceiver readiness.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C. (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McGarty | first1 = C. | year = 2001 | title = Social Identity Theory does not maintain that identification produces bias, and Self-categorization Theory does not maintain that salience is identification: Two comments on Mummendey, Klink and Brown | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 40 | issue = Pt 2| pages = 173–176 | pmid = 11446223 | doi=10.1348/014466601164777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Perceiver readiness====
Perceiver readiness, which Turner first described as ''relative accessibility'',&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt; “reflects a person’s past experiences, present expectations, and current motives, values, goals and needs”.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt; It is the relevant aspects of cognition that the perceiver brings to the environment. For example, a perceiver who categorizes frequently on the basis of nationality (e.g., “we [[Americans]]”) is, due to that past experience, more likely to formulate a similar self category under new conditions. Accordingly, ''social identification'', or the degree to which the group is valued and self-involving, may be  thought of as an important factor that affects a person’s readiness to use a particular social category.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, et al. (2011)."/&gt;

====Comparative fit====
[[File:SCT comparative context.JPG|thumb|right|300px|alt= Variation in self-categorization as a function of comparative context.| Figure 2. Variation in self-categorization as a function of comparative context. In Context 1 Amy and Beth self-categorize in terms of lower-level personal identities that accentuate their differences from each other. However, in Context 2 the comparative is extended to include more different others (here men), and Amy and Beth are now more likely to define themselves in terms of a higher-level social identity. They hence appear more similar to each other. The main theoretical point here is that as comparative context is extended, people tend to self-categorize at a more inclusive, higher level of abstraction.&lt;ref name="Haslam, et al. (2011)."/&gt;]]Comparative fit is determined by the meta-contrast principle—which states that people are more likely to believe that a collection of stimuli represents an entity to the degree that the differences between those stimuli are less than the differences between that collection of stimuli and other stimuli.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt; For predicting whether a group will categorize an individual as an ingroup or outgroup member, the meta-contrast principle may be defined as the ratio of the average similarity of the individual to outgroup members over the average similarity of the individual to ingroup members. The meta-contrast ratio is dependent on the context, or frame of reference, in which the categorization process is occurring.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. (1999)"&gt;Turner, J. C. (1999). Current issues in research on social identity and self-categorization theories. In N. Ellemers, R. Spears, &amp; B. Doosje (Eds), Social identity: Context, commitment, content (pp. 6-34) Oxford, UK. Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the ratio is a comparison based on whichever stimuli are cognitively present. For example, if the frame of reference is reduced such that potential outgroup members are no longer cognitively present, ingroup members regard the individual as less similar to the group and are less likely to categorize that individual as belonging to that group.

====Normative fit====
Normative fit is the extent that the perceived behaviour or attributes of an individual or collection of individuals conforms to the perceiver’s knowledge-based expectations.&lt;ref name="Oakes, et al. (1994)"&gt;Oakes, P. J., Haslam, S. A. &amp; Turner, J. C. (1994). Stereotyping as social reality. Oxford, UK and Cambridge, MA:  Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, normative fit is evaluated with reference to the ''perceiver readiness'' component of the categorisation process.&lt;ref name="Brown, P. M. &amp; Turner, J. C. (2002)."&gt;Brown, P. M. &amp; Turner, J. C. (2002). The role of theories in the formation of stereotype content. In C. McGarty, V. Y. Yzerbyt &amp; R. Spears (Eds), Stereotypes as explanations: The formation of meaningful beliefs about social groups. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of the role of normative fit in categorization, although a collection of individuals may be categorized as an entity on the basis of ''comparative fit'', they are only labelled using the specific social category of “science students” if perceived as hard working. That is, they fit the normative content of that category.

===Online category formation===
Self-categorization theorists posit “self-categorization is comparative, inherently variable, fluid and context dependent.”&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt; They reject the notion that self concepts are stored invariant structures that exist ready for application.&lt;ref name="Oakes &amp; Turner (1990)"/&gt; Where stability is observed in self perception this is not attributed to stored stable categories, but rather to stability in both the perceiver and the social context in which the perceiver is situated.&lt;ref name="Oakes et al. (1994)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."&gt;McGarty, C. (1999). Categorization in social psychology. Sage Publications: London, Thousand Oaks, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt; This variability is systematic and occurs in response to the changing context in which the perceiver is situated. As an example, the category of [[psychologists]] can be perceived quite differently if compared to [[physicists]] as opposed to [[artists]] (with variation perhaps on how [[Scientific method|scientific]] psychologists are perceived to be).&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt; In self-categorization theory contextual changes to the salient social category are sometimes referred to as shifting [[Self-categorization theory#Prototypicality|prototypicality]].

Although the theory accepts that prior categorization behaviour impacts present perception (i.e., as part of perceiver readiness), self-categorization theory has key advantages over descriptions of social categorization where categories are rigid and invariant cognitive structures that are stored in comparative isolation prior to application. One advantage is that this perspective removes the [[implausibility]] of storing enough categorical information to account for all the nuanced categorization that humans use daily.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Onorato (1998)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1994)."/&gt; Another advantage is that it brings social cognition in line with a [[Connectionism|connectionist approach]] to cognition.&lt;ref name="McGarty (2002)"/&gt; The connectionist approach is a neurologically plausible model of cognition where semantic units are not stored, but rather semantic information forms as a consequence of network pattern activation (both current and prior).&lt;ref name="Smith, E. R. (1996)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = E. R. | year = 1996 | title = What do connectionism and social psychology offer each other? | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 70 | issue = 5| pages = 893–912 | pmid = 8656338 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.5.893}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith, E.

===Prototypicality===
In social psychology a category [[prototype]] may be thought of as a “representative exemplar” of a category.&lt;ref name="Billig, M. (1987)"&gt;Billig, M. (1987). Arguing and thinking: A rhetorical approach to social psychology: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-categorization theory predicts that what is prototypical of a category is contingent on the context in which the category is encountered.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt; More specifically, when the [[Self-categorization theory#Comparative fit|comparative context]] changes (i.e., the psychologically available stimuli change) this has implications for how the self category is perceived and the nature of subsequent [[Self-categorization theory#Depersonalization and self-stereotyping|depersonalization]].  Self-categorization theory predicts that individuals adopt the features of a salient self category (self-stereotyping), and the content of the category they adopt depends on the present comparative context.

An individual’s degree of prototypicality also varies in relation to changes in the comparative context, and self-categorization theory expects this to have direct implications for interpersonal phenomenon. Specifically, prototypicality plays an important role in the social identity approach to [[Social identity approach#Leadership|leadership]],&lt;ref name="Platow, M. J. et al. (1997)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Platow | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Hoar | first2 = S. | last3 = Reid | first3 = S. Harley | last4 = Morrison | first4 = D. | last5 = Morrison | first5 = Dianne | year = 1997 | title = Endorsement of distributively fair and unfair leaders in interpersonal and intergroup situations | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 465–494 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0992(199707)27:4&lt;465::aid-ejsp817&gt;3.0.co;2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; influence, and [[interpersonal attraction]]. For example, on interpersonal attraction, self-categorization theory states that "self and others are evaluated positively to the degree that they are perceived as prototypical (representative, exemplary, etc.) of the next more inclusive (positively valued) self-category of which they are being compared".&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;

Levels of individual prototypicality may be gauged using the meta-contrast principle, and indeed it is this purpose the meta-contrast ratio is more often used for.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt; Furthermore, although prototypicality is most often discussed in relation to the perception of individuals within a group, groups may also be assessed in terms of how prototypical they are of a superordinate category.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, M. (2012). Group status is related to group prototypicality in the absence of social identity concerns. ''Journal of Social Psychology, 152, 386–389. doi: 10.1080/00224545.2011.614648''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.2011.614648 [View&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

===Social influence===
{{main|social influence}}

Self-categorization theory provides an account of social influence.&lt;ref name="Haslam, A. S. (2001)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam, et al. (2011)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1982)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. (1991)"&gt;Turner, J. C. (1991). Social influence. Milton Keynes: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This account is sometimes referred to as the theory of ''referent informational influence''.&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1982)"/&gt; According to self-categorization theory, as social identities become salient, and depersonalization and self-stereotyping occurs, people adopt the norms, beliefs, and behaviors of fellow ingroup members. They also distance themselves from the norms, beliefs, and behaviors of comparison outgroup members. When someone observes a difference between themselves and a fellow ingroup member that person will experience subjective uncertainty. That uncertainty can be resolved by either a) recategorizing people or the situation to reflect those perceived differences, or b) engaging in a social influence process whereby one person makes changes to become more similar to the other. Which person adopts the views or behaviors of the other (i.e. who influences who) is predicted to be that person who is most prototypical of the ingroup. In other words, the person who exemplifies the norms, values, and behaviors of the ingroup the most. The self-categorization theory account of social influence has received a large amount of empirical support.&lt;ref name="McGarty &amp; Turner (1992)."&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = McGarty|first1 = C.|last2=Turner|first2=J.

Self-categorization theory’s account of social influence differs from other social psychological approaches to social influence. It rejects the traditional distinction between [[informational influence]] and [[normative influence]],&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. (1991)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes, (1997)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Oakes | first2 = P. J. | editor1-last = McGarty | editor1-first = C. | editor2-last = Haslam | editor2-first = S. A. | year = 1997  | title = The socially structured mind | journal = The Message of Social Psychology | pages = 355–373 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where informational influence involves the assessment of social information based on its merit and normative influence involves public compliance to the expectations of group members. For self-categorization theory social information does not have merit independent of self-categorization. Instead, information is perceived as valid to the extent that it is perceived to be a normative belief of the ingroup. Normative influence, on the other hand, is not normative at all. Rather, it is counter-normative influence based compliance to expectations of psychological outgroup members. In a similar vein self-categorization theory also challenges the distinction between objective reality testing and social reality testing (e.g. the [[elaboration likelihood model]]).&lt;ref name="Oakes et al. (1994)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes (1986)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1982)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. (1991)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Oakes, (1997)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oakes &amp; Reynolds (1997)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oakes|first1=P. J.|last2=Reynolds|first2=R. J.|title=Asking the accuracy question: is measurement the answer?|journal=The Social Psychology of Stereotyping and Group Life|year=1997|pages=119–143|editor1-first=R.|editor1-last=Spears|editor2-first=P.J.|editor2-last=Oakes|editor3-first=N.|editor3-last=Ellemers|editor4-first=S.A.|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Haslam}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that there is no such thing as objective reality testing isolated from social reality testing. Sensory data is always interpreted with respect of the beliefs and ideas of the perceiver, which in turn are bound up in the psychological group memberships of that perceiver.

===Out-group homogeneity===
{{main|Out-group homogeneity}}

Outgroup homogeneity can be defined as seeing the outgroup members as more homogeneous than ingroup members.&lt;ref name="Quattrone &amp; Jones (1980)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quattrone|first1=George A.|last2=Jones|first2=Edward E.|title=The perception of variability within in-groups and out-groups: Implications for the law of small numbers.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=38|issue=1|year=1980|pages=141–152|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.38.1.141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-categorization accounts for the outgroup homogeneity effect as a function of perceiver motivation and the resultant [[Self-categorization theory#Comparative fit|comparative context]],&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt; which is a description of the psychologically available stimuli at any one time. The theory argues that when perceiving an outgroup the psychologically available stimuli include both ingroup and outgroup members. Under these conditions the perceiver is more likely to categorize in accordance with ingroup and outgroup memberships and is consequently naturally motivated to [[Self-categorization theory#Accentuation|accentuate]] intergroup differences as well as intragroup similarities. Conversely, when perceiving an ingroup the outgroup members may not be psychologically available. In such circumstances there is no ingroup-outgroup categorization and thus no accentuation. Indeed, accentuation of intragroup differences may occur under these circumstances for the same sense making reasons.

In line with this explanation it has been shown that in an intergroup context both the ingroup and outgroup is perceived as more homogeneous, while when judged in isolation the ingroup is perceived as comparatively [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]].&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1995)"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Haslam, et al. (1996)."&gt;Halsam, S. A., Oakes, P. J., Turner, J. C., &amp; McGarty, C. (1995). Social identity, self-categorization and the perceived homogeneity of ingroups and outgroups: the interaction between social motivation and cognition. In R. M. Sorrentino &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), Handbook of Motivation and Cognition (Vol. 3, pp. 182-222). New York: Guilford&lt;/ref&gt; This is also congruent with depersonalization, where under certain circumstances perceivers may see themselves as interchangeable members of the ingroup.&lt;ref name="De Cremer 138–146"&gt;{{cite journal| last=De Cremer| first=David| title= Perceptions of group homogeneity as a function of social comparison: The mediating role of group identity| journal=Current Psychology| date=1 August 2001| volume=20| issue=2| pages=138–146| doi=10.1007/s12144-001-1021-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The self-categorization theory eliminates the need to posit differing processing mechanisms for ingroups and outroups, as well as accounting for findings of outgroup homogeneity in the [[minimal group paradigm]].&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt;

==Controversies==

===Meta-theoretical debate===
The social identity approach explicitly rejects the metatheory of research that regards limited information processing as the cause of social stereotyping.&lt;ref name="Oakes et al. (1994)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty (2002)"&gt;{{cite journal |last= McGarty|first= C. |year= 2002|title= Stereotype formation as category formation |journal= Stereotypes as Explanations |pages= 16–37 |editor1-first= C.|editor1-last= McGarty |editor2-first= V.Y. |editor2-last= Yzerbyt |editor3-first= R. |editor3-last= Spears }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oakes &amp; Turner (1996)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oakes | first1 = Penny | last2 = Turner | first2 = John | editor-last = Stroebe | editor-first = Wolfgang | editor-link1= Wolfgang Stroebe|editor2-last = Hewstone | editor2-first = Miles | year = 1990 | title = Is limited information processing capacity the cause of social stereotyping? | journal = European Review of Social Psychology | volume = 1 | pages = 111–135 | doi=10.1080/14792779108401859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, where other researchers adopt the position that stereotyping is second best to other information processing techniques (e.g.,  individuation), social identity theorists argue that in many contexts a stereotypical perspective is entirely appropriate. Moreover, it is argued that in many intergroup contexts to take an individualistic view would be decidedly maladaptive and demonstrate ignorance of important social realities.&lt;ref name="Haslam et al. (1996)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslam &amp; Turner (1992)."/&gt;

===Category hierarchies===
Self-categorization theory emphasises the role of category hierarchies in social perception.&lt;ref name="Turner (1999)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. et al. (1987)."/&gt; That is, much like a biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], social groups at lower [[Self-categorization theory#Levels of abstraction|levels of abstraction]] are subsumed within social groups at higher levels of abstraction. A useful example comes from the world of [[team sport]]s, where a particular social group such as [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] [[Fan (person)|fans]] may be an ingroup for a perceiver who may compare with a relevant outgroup (e.g., [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans). However, at a higher level of abstraction, both social groups may be subsumed into the singular category of [[Association football|football]] fans. This is known as a superordinate category, and in this context those Liverpool fans once considered outgroup members are now considered fellow ingroup members. The new salient outgroup might instead be [[Rugby union|rugby]] fans. Awareness of category hierarchies has led to the development of the [[common ingroup identity]] model. This model suggests that conflict at one level of abstraction (e.g., between Manchester United fans and Liverpool fans) might be ameliorated by making salient a more inclusive superordinate ingroup.&lt;ref name=" (1993)."&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gaertner | first1 = S. L. | last2 = Dovidio | first2 = J. F. | last3 = Anastasio | first3 = P. A. | last4 = Bachman | first4 = B. A. | last5 = Rust | first5 = M. C. | year = 1993 | title = The common ingroup identity model: Recategorization and the reduction of intergroup bias | url = | journal = European Review of Social Psychology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 1–26 | doi=10.1080/14792779343000004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been noted, however, that very few social groups can be described in hierarchical terms. For example, [[Catholics|Catholic people]] in [[Germany]] cannot be always considered a subordinate category of Germans, as there are Catholic people throughout the globe. McGarty proposes that the theory's use of hierarchies as an organizing principle must be relaxed. The alternative proposition is that social psychologists should look to [[Venn diagram|Venn]]-like structures for descriptions of social structure.&lt;ref name="McGarty, C (1999)."/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty (2002)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGarty, C.

In R. J. Crisp and M. Hewstone (Eds.), Multiple Social Categorization: Processes Models and Applications (pp. 25-49). Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The awareness of crossed cutting social categories has allowed for the development of further intergroup conflict reduction strategies.&lt;ref name=" (2006)."&gt;Dovidio. J. F., Gaertner, S. L., Hodson, G., Riek, B. M., Johnson, K. M., &amp; Houlette, M. (2006).

Multiple social categorization: Processes, models and application (pp, 65-89). . New York: Psychology Press. .&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation in the theory===
Brewer and Brown describe self-categorization theory as a “version of social identity theory” that is heavily cognitive and is not attentive to many motivational and affective processes.&lt;ref name="Brewer &amp; Brown (1998)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = M. B. | last2 = Brown | first2 = R. J. | editor-last = Gilbert | editor-first = D. T. | editor2-last = Fiske | editor2-first = S. T. | editor3-last = Lindzey | editor3-first = G. | year = 1998 | title = Intergroup relations | journal = The Handbook of Social Psychology | volume = 2 | pages = 554–594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner and Reynolds, in response to this style of commentary, counter that describing self-categorization theory as a replacement to social identity theory is an error, and that self-categorization theory was always intended to complement social identity theory.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Turner | first1 = John C. | last2 = Reynolds | first2 =Katherine J. | editor1-last = Brown | editor1-first = Rupert  | editor2-last = Gaertner | editor2-first = Sam L. | year = 2001 | chapter = The Social Identity Perspective in Intergroup Relations: Theories, Themes, and Controversies |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNZHf3K4xzMC&amp;pg=PA133 | title = Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNZHf3K4xzMC | volume = 3 | issue = 1 |isbn=978-0-470-69270-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner and Reynolds also argue that such commentary unreasonably discounts the motivational concerns that are articulated in self-categorization theory.&lt;ref name="Turner &amp; Reynolds (2001)"/&gt; For example, the motivation to maintain positive self categories and the motivation to achieve ingroup consensus.&lt;ref name="Turner (1985)"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13548">The '''Strategic Environmental Assessment''' (SEA), is a process in [[Denmark]] for assessing the environmental effects of proposed government projects and programmes. Established in 1993 by an administrative order of Denmark's Prime Minister’s Office,&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton and Sadler, Strategic Environmental Assessment A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience, Earthscan, London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; this requirement was not initially enshrined in law, but was supported by a [[government circular]] which required an SEA to be carried out on “government proposals with major environmental effects”.&lt;ref&gt;Therival and Partidario (1996), The Practice of Strategic Environmental Assessment, Earthscan, London, p25.&lt;/ref&gt;  The SEA process was limited only to government proposals and did not extend to plans and programmes. SEAs were required to focus on the impacts proposals would have on physical, ecological, cultural, health and [[risk factors]].&lt;ref&gt;Therival and Partidario (1996), The Practice of Strategic Environmental Assessment, Earthscan, London.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the SEA requirement was extended to new parliamentary acts in addition to government proposals at the national level.

== Initial administrative order ==

The administrative order broadly outlined four steps in the SEA process.&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton and Sadler, Strategic Environmental Assessment A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience, Earthscan, London, 2005, pg 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Screening – using the checklist contained in the guidance ([[water]], [[air]], [[climate]], surface of the earth, [[soil]], [[flora]] and [[fauna]], landscape, resources, waste, historical buildings, [[population health]], safety and transport of harmful substances) proposals that were likely to have a significant environmental impact had to be identified.

2. Scoping – the cumulative effects of a bill or policy had to be identified.

3. Assessment – analysis of the effects that had been identified as significant in the previous stages. Crucially the guidance stated that it was not possible to give an overall description, so a list of factors to be referenced were included in the guidance.

4. Report – a separate report of the environmental effects had to be included, attached to the bill that was to be put before parliament. The report had to be non-technical and easy to understand – it also had to be made available to the public.

===Legal Framework===

The SEA Directive (2001/42/EC) was integrated into the Danish planning system in 2004. The SEA Directive now ensures that SEA has been extended to plans and programmes, rather than just government proposals. The Act on the [[Environmental impact assessment|Environmental Assessment]] of Plans and Programmes (Danish SEA Act) was passed into law in May 2004 and “is strictly in accordance with the requirements of the [2001/42/EC] directive”.&lt;ref&gt;Elling cited in: Jones et al., Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London, 2005, pg66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEA Act allows the Minister for the Environment a certain amount of discretion (as the administrative order of 1993 did), with the Minister able to determine whether or not a private or [[Public ownership|publicly owned]] company is required to carry out a SEA on their plan or programme, when they are acting in the capacity of a public authority (for example, the provision of utilities).&lt;ref&gt;Elling cited in: Jones et al., Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also important to note that the SEA Act can be overruled, as long as a plan or programme complies with the procedural and substantive requirements of the SEA Directive. This helps to avoid duplication with “land use plans that have been prepared in accordance with the [Danish] Planning Act”.&lt;ref&gt;Elling cited in: Jones et al., Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London, 2005, pg66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guidance Documents===

Despite the integration of the SEA Directive, SEA guidance was restricted to a publication called Strategic Environmental Assessment of Bills and Other Proposals: Examples and Experience issued in 1995 by the Ministry for the Environment. New guidance was prepared in 2002, but never published due to a change in government.&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton and Sadler, Strategic Environmental Assessment A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience, Earthscan, London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 guidance issues a six step approach with regards to the type of information that should be included within an SEA&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton and Sadler, Strategic Environmental Assessment A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience, Earthscan, London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blst.dk/Planlaegning/Miljoekonsekvenser/MiljoevurderingPlaner/, Danish Ministry for the Environment (2008), Miljøvurdering af planer og programmer (SEA Legislation &amp; Guidance), Retrieved 18/03/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Formulating the problem and describing the process of the proposal and the alternatives that have been considered
* Identifying the relevant environmental effects
* Describing the extent of the likely environmental effects
* Identifying mitigation measures and monitoring follow up programmes
* assessing and weighing the environmental effects in relation to policy objectives
* A statement with the summary of the main findings

In 2006, The Environment Ministry released up to date guidance that related to the SEA requirements for plans and programmes dating from 2004. Instruction number 9664 entitled 'Vejledning om miljøvurdering af planer og programmer' replaced the earlier guidance dating from 1995. The new guide was later supplemented, in 2007, by examples of SEAs that had been conducted.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=12953, Danish Ministry for the Environment (2008 (2)), Vejledning om miljøvurdering af planer og programmer, Retrieved 19/03/08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blst.dk/NR/rdonlyres/46372868-F4B7-4900-A743-063A553CB6E5/49265/Eksempelsamlingendeligudgave.pdf, Danish Ministry for the Environment (2008 (3)), Eksempelsamling for miljøvurdering af planer og programmer September 2007, Retrieved 19/03/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===SEA steps required===

SEA steps that are required are defined by the SEA Act and supplemented by the guidance.

The table sets out the specific SEA process as defined by 2006 and 2007 guidance from the [[Ministry of the Environment of Denmark|Danish Ministry of the Environment]]. The process is broadly split into nine main stages:

==Examples of SEAs produced so far==

Examples of Danish SEAs carried out following the introduction of [[European Union|the EU]] SEA Directive are “so far few".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danidadevforum.um.dk/en/menu/Topics/EnvironmentalSustainability/ToolsAndReferences/Guidelines/StrategicEnvironmentalAssessment/, Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (2007), Strategic Environmental Assessment, Retrieved 25/03/08.&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some examples of SEA that have been produced prior to the introduction of the EU SEA Directive.

===North Jutland Regional Development Plan (1995-1997)===

This was the very first SEA to be carried out in Denmark and was carried out before the introduction of the EU SEA Directive. As a result of this pilot SEA, the major concern amongst stakeholders was reconciling negative environmental impacts that resulted from planning activities. Overall, while stakeholders felt that no new knowledge was gained from carrying out an SEA, the planning process became more transparent. Politicians felt that there was more information on which they could make an informed decision about the choices presented to them. It was also decided that consultation should be carried out during the scoping process, rather than at later stages of the SEA process.&lt;ref&gt;Jones et al. (2005), Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional groundwater plan for Vejle County, Eastern Jutland (2002)===

This SEA was carried out as a consequence of the regional planning process (which included the requirement for SEAs) and is notable for the alternatives suggested. [[Groundwater]] extraction takes places beneath polluted [[urban area]]s and two strategies were devised – ’cleaning up’ or extracting water from rural areas. The resulting analysis found there was no clear best solution and therefore other factors, such as economic considerations, should be taken into account to aid the decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;Jones et al. (2005), Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional mineral extraction plan for Vejle County (2003)===

Extraction of minerals controlled under the plan were assessed under six criteria – transportation, economy, changes in landscape, landscape dynamics, pollution suffered by local residents and stress factors for local residents. This SEA clearly influenced the decision making process as the decision on the best alternative was deferred until suitable mitigation measures could be found.&lt;ref&gt;Jones et al. (2005), Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strengths and Weaknesses of the SEA system==

===Strengths===

Before the implementation of the SEA Directive into the Danish planning system, there had been a long history of consideration of the environmental effects that a planning process may have. Therefore, the transposition of the SEA Directive into Danish legislation conforms fully, and the supporting guidance (albeit late) ensures that SEAs conducted should be directive compliant. This historical approach has ensured that the SEA process has been institutionalised into the planning process. This ensures that environmental considerations are the subject of political debates and that parliamentary bills are prepared adequately with the SEA Directive and Danish SEA Act in mind.

The SEA process in Denmark is transparent and SEAs have a discernible influence upon the decision making process (Jones et al., 2005). There is a long tradition of public participation in the Danish planning system and this philosophy is no exception with regards to the SEA system. This is coupled with a feeling among planners and stakeholders, that despite the costs of SEA, overall it is a worthwhile and productive process.

===Weaknesses===

The major weakness in the Danish SEA system largely relates to government ministries – this is ironic given that they are responsible for the integration of the SEA Directive into Danish legislation.

* There is a lack of satisfactory scoping procedure when ministries prepare bills and conduct environmental assessments.
* There is an administrative failure of ministries excluding negative effects and including only positive effects.
* Political adaptation of environmental assessments often takes place within ministries, sometimes with the result that information on the environmental impact of bills is not submitted to Parliament.
* Further consideration should be given to how the public could play a more attentive role in the SEA process to help overcome issues of stakeholder dominance and political short-sightedness.
* The development of SEA at the plan and programme level should be monitored to evaluate its contribution on the policy level and to identify how the practice on both levels could complement and stimulate each other.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unece.org/env/eia/documents/PolicySEA/SEA%20of%20Policies%20volume.pdf, RECCEE (2005), Strategic Environmental Assessment at the Policy Level: Recent Progress, Current Status and Future Progress, Retrieved 25/03/08&lt;/ref&gt;

Monitoring systems currently in place need to be strengthened. Currently monitoring of environmental impacts is done only through informal communication instead of the Minister for the Environment issuing specific rules.&lt;ref&gt;Jones et al. (2005), Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8994">'''Strict scrutiny''' is the most stringent standard of [[judicial review]] used by [[United States]] courts. It is part of the hierarchy of standards that courts use to determine which is weightier, a constitutional right or principle or the government's interest against observance of the principle. The lesser standards are [[rational basis review]] and exacting or [[intermediate scrutiny]]. These standards are used to test statutes and government action at all levels of government within the United States.

The notion of "levels of judicial scrutiny", including strict scrutiny, was introduced in [[United States v. Carolene Products Co.#Footnote Four|Footnote 4]] of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' (1938), one of a series of decisions testing the constitutionality of [[New Deal]] legislation. The first and most notable case in which the Supreme Court applied the strict scrutiny standard and found the government's actions constitutional was ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'' (1944), in which the Court upheld the exclusion of [[Japanese American]]s from designated areas during [[World War II]].

== Applicability ==
U.S. courts apply the strict scrutiny standard in two contexts: when a fundamental constitutional right is infringed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/410/113/case.html Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 155 (1973) (Blackmun, J.)], accessed July 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; particularly those found in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and those the court has deemed a [[fundamental right]] protected by the [[Due Process Clause]] or "liberty clause" of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]], or when a government action applies to a "[[suspect classification]]", such as [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[national origin]]. 

To pass strict scrutiny, the law or policy must satisfy three tests:

* It must be justified by a [[government interest|compelling governmental interest]]. While the Courts have never [[bright line rule|brightly defined]] how to determine if an interest is compelling, the concept generally refers to something necessary or crucial, as opposed to something merely preferred. Examples include national security, preserving the lives of a large number of individuals, and not violating explicit constitutional protections.
* The law or policy must be [[narrow tailoring|narrowly tailored]] to achieve that goal or interest. If the government action encompasses too much ([[overbreadth doctrine|overbroad]]) or fails to address essential aspects of the compelling interest, then the rule is not considered narrowly tailored.
* The law or policy must be the least restrictive means for achieving that interest: there must not be a less restrictive way to effectively achieve the compelling government interest. The test will be met even if there is another method that is equally the least restrictive. Some legal scholars consider this "least restrictive means" requirement part of being narrowly tailored, but the Court generally evaluates it separately.

Legal scholars, including judges and professors, often say that strict scrutiny is "strict in theory, fatal in fact" since popular perception is that most laws subjected to the standard are struck down. However, an empirical study of strict scrutiny decisions in the federal courts found that laws survive strict scrutiny more than 30% of the time. In one area of law, religious liberty, laws that burden religious liberty survived strict scrutiny review in nearly 60% of cases. However, a discrepancy was found in the type of religious liberty claim, with most claims for exemption from law failing and no allegedly discriminatory laws surviving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=897360 Adam Winkler, "Fatal in Theory and Strict in Fact: An Empirical Analysis of Strict Scrutiny in the Federal Courts", ''Vanderbilt Law Review", Vol. 59, p. 793, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; See also the cases cited below, however; several appear to permit the exemption from laws based upon religious liberty.

The compelling state interest test is distinguishable from the [[rational basis]] test, which involves claims that do not involve a suspect class and involve a [[liberty interest]] rather than a fundamental right. It is also important to note that unlike the [[rational basis]] test, the burden of proof falls on the state, in cases that require strict scrutiny or [[intermediate scrutiny]].

==Suspect classification==
{{Main article|Suspect classification}}
The Supreme Court has established standards for determining whether a statute or policy's classification requires the use of strict scrutiny. The class must have experienced a history of discrimination, must be definable as a group based on "obvious, immutable, or distinguishing characteristics," be a minority or "politically powerless," and its characteristics must have little relationship to the government's policy aims or the ability of the group's members to contribute to society.[Citations needed.]

The Court has consistently found that classifications based on race, national origin, and alienage require strict scrutiny review. The Supreme Court held that all race-based classifications must be subjected to strict scrutiny in ''[[Adarand Constructors v. Peña]],'' 515 U.S. 200 (1995), overruling ''[[Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC]]'' (89-453), 497 U.S. 547 (1990), which had briefly allowed the use of intermediate scrutiny to analyze the Equal Protection implications of race-based classifications in the narrow category of affirmative-action programs established by the federal government in the broadcasting field.

==''De jure'' versus ''de facto'' discrimination==
As applied in ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'', which upheld the race-based [[Executive Order 9066|exclusion order]] and internment during [[World War II]] of [[Japanese American]]s who had resided on the West Coast of the United States, strict scrutiny was limited to instances of ''[[de jure]]'' discrimination, where a racial classification is written into the language of a statute.

The Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.]]'' provided further definition to the concept of intent and clarified three particular areas in which intent of a particular administrative or legislative decision becomes apparent, the presence of any of which demands the harsher equal protection test. The Court must use strict scrutiny if one of these tests, among others, is met:
# the impact is so "stark and dramatic" as to be unexplainable on non-racial grounds, as in ''[[Yick Wo v. Hopkins]]''
# the historical background of the decision suggests intent
# the legislative and administrative records leading up to the decision show intent

=== Notable cases ===
*''[[Skinner v. Oklahoma|Skinner v. State of Oklahoma]], [[ex rel|ex. rel.]] Williamson'', [[Case citation|316 U.S. 535]] (1942), cf. ''[[Buck v. Bell]]'' {{ussc|274|200|1927}}, banning [[Compulsory sterilization|forced sterilization]]
*''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', 347 U.S. 483 (1954), ending [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in public schools
*''[[One, Inc. v. Olesen]]'', 301 U.S. 340 (1958), ending censorship of homosexual publications
*''[[Sherbert v. Verner]]'', 374 U.S. 398 (1963), allowing someone fired because of religious conflicts to receive unemployment

*''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'', 897 U.S. 113 (1967), allowing people of different races to marry
*''[[Wisconsin v. Yoder]]'', 406 U.S. 205 (1972), allowing the [[Amish]] to remove their children from public schools after 8th grade
*''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113 (1973), allowing women to receive [[Abortion|abortions]]
*''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'', 494 U.S. 872 (1990), allowing states to deny unemployment benefits to those using illegal drugs for religious purposes
*''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', 380 U.S. 144 (1996), allowing local governments in Colorado to pass discrimination protections for homosexuals
*''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'', 521 U.S. 507 (1997), holding that some zoning laws may be an undue restriction of religious freedom
*''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal]]'', 546 U.S. 418 (2006), allowing religious use of illegal drugs

== History ==
The Noun Project was co-founded by Sofya Polyakov, Edward Boatman,  and Scott Thomas and is headed by Polyakov.&lt;ref name="TNP: About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About: Creating, Sharing and Celebrating the World's Visual Language|url=http://thenounproject.com/about/|publisher=The Noun Project|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boatman recalled his frustration while working at an architectural firm at the lack of a central repository for common icons, "things such as airplanes, bicycles and people." That idea morphed into a broader platform for visual communication. The site was launched on [[Kickstarter]] in December 2010, which raised more than $14,000 in donations, with symbols from the [[National Park Service]] and other sources whose content was in the [[public domain]]. Site design was by the firm Simple.Honest.Work, with mentoring from the Designer Fund.&lt;ref name=TheAtlantic /&gt;&lt;ref name="core77 interview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Casey|first=Valerie|title=Visualizing Change: An Interview with the Noun Project|url=http://www.core77.com/blog/graphic_design/visualizing_change_an_interview_with_the_noun_project_22924.asp|accessdate=24 April 2013|newspaper=Core77|date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FastCo&gt;{{cite news|last=Pavlus|first=John|title=The Noun Project Uncovers the Designers Behind Our Universal Symbols|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1662843/the-noun-project-uncovers-the-designers-behind-our-universal-symbols|accessdate=23 April 2013|newspaper=Fast Company|date=December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FastCompany: Iconathons" /&gt;

The Noun Project has generated interest and new symbols by hosting a series of "Iconathons", the first of which was held in the summer of 2011. The sessions typically run five hours and include graphic designers, content experts, and interested volunteers, all working in small groups that focus on a specific issue, such as democracy, transportation or nutrition. The idea for the event came from Chacha Sikes, who was at the time a fellow at [[Code for America]].&lt;ref name="FastCompany: Iconathons"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jao|first=Carren|title=Iconathon Lets Regular Joes Design Icons For City Problems|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/1664938/iconathon-lets-regular-joes-design-icons-for-city-problems#1|accessdate=24 April 2013|newspaper=Fast Company|date=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
Contributors come from around the world.  A 2012 [[New York Times]] story profiled one of them: Luis Prado, a graphic designer at the [[Washington State Department of Natural Resources]], who uploaded 83 icons he had created for his agency, including a pruning saw, a logging truck and a candidate symbol for [[global warming]], which he created when he couldn't find one online.&lt;ref name="NYT Global warming icon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Dylan|title=A Thousand Words on Global Warming|url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/a-thousand-words-on-global-warming/|accessdate=24 April 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has four stylistic guidelines: include only the essential characteristics of the idea conveyed, maintain a consistent design style, favor an industrial look over a hand-drawn one, and avoid conveying personal opinions, feelings and beliefs.&lt;ref name="TNP: Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|title=Design Guidelines for User Submissions|url=http://blog.thenounproject.com/post/13118286227/design-guidelines-for-user-submissions|publisher=The Noun Project|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributors select a public domain mark or a [[Creative Commons]] attribution license, which enables others to use the symbol with attribution, free of charge. The attribution requirement can be waived upon payment of a nominal fee, which is split between the artist and The Noun Project.&lt;ref name="TNP:Using Symbols" /&gt; The founders envisioned the site as being primarily useful for designers and architects, but the range of users includes people with [[autism]] and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], who sometimes favor a visual language, as well as business professionals incorporating the symbols into presentations.&lt;ref name="core77 interview" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8594">[[Max Weber]] distinguished three [[ideal type]]s of legitimate political leadership, domination and authority.  He wrote about these three types of domination in both his essay ''[[The Three Types of Legitimate Rule]]'' which was published in his masterwork ''[[Economy and Society]]'' (see Weber 1922/1978:215-216), and in his classic speech "[[Politics as a Vocation]]" (see Weber 1919/2015:137-138).
# '''[[charismatic authority]]''' (''character'', ''heroism'', ''leadership'', ''religious''),
# '''[[traditional authority]]''' (''patriarchs, patrimonialism, feudalism'') and
# '''[[legal authority]]''' (''modern law and state, bureaucracy'').

These three types are [[ideal type]]s and rarely appear in their pure form.

According to Weber, authority is power accepted as legitimate by those subjected to it. These three forms of authority are said to appear in an "hierarchical development order". [[Sovereign state|States]] progress from ''charismatic authority'', to ''traditional authority'', and finally reach the ''state of rational-legal authority'' which is characteristic of a modern [[liberal democracy]].

==Charismatic domination==
{{main|Charismatic domination}}
Charismatic authority grows out of the personal charm or the strength of an individual personality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.12manage.com/methods_weber_charismatic_leadership.html Charismatic Leadership (Weber)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was described by Weber in a lecture as "the authority of the extraordinary and personal gift of grace (charisma)"; he distinguished it from the other forms of authority by stating "Men do not obey him [the charismatic ruler] by virtue of tradition or statute, but because they believe in him."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ne.jp/asahi/moriyuki/abukuma/weber/lecture/politics_vocation.html Politics as a Vocation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the actual power or capabilities of the leader are irrelevant, as long as the followers believe that such power exists. Thus, according to Weber, it is particularly difficult for charismatic leaders to maintain their authority because the followers must continue to legitimize the authority of the leader.

Charismatic domination is insofar different from legal-rational and traditional power as it does not develop from established tradition but rather from the belief the followers have in the leader.

According to Weber, once the leader loses his charisma or dies, systems based on charismatic authority tend to transform into traditional or legal-rational systems.

==Traditional domination==
{{main|Traditional domination}}
In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the [[authority]] comes from [[tradition]] or custom; Weber described it as "the authority of the eternal yesterday" and identified it as the source of authority for [[monarchy|monarchies]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In this type of domination, the traditional rights of a powerful individual or group are accepted by the subordinate, or at least not challenged. The dominant individual could be a clan leader, eldest, the head of a family, a patriarchal figure or dominant elite. Historically this has been the most common type of government.

According to Weber, inequalities are created and preserved by traditional authority. Should this authority not be challenged, the dominant leader or group will stay in power. For Weber, traditional power blocked the development of rational-legal authority.

==Rational-legal domination==
{{main|Legal domination}}
Legal authority, also known as rational-legal authority, is where an individual or institution exerts power by virtue of the legal office that they hold. It is the authority that demands obedience to the office rather than the officeholder; once they leave office, their rational-legal authority is lost. Weber identified ''"rationally-created rules"''&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; as the central feature of this form of authority. Modern [[democracy|democracies]] contain many examples of legal-rational regimes. There are different ways in which legal authority can develop. Many societies have developed a system of laws and regulations and there exist many different principles of legality. With the development of a legal-rational system, the political system is likely to be rationalized similarly. [[Constitution]]s, written documents, established offices and regular elections are often associated with modern legal-rational political systems. These in the past have tended to develop in opposition to earlier traditional systems such as monarchies, where the set of rules are not well developed. As these systems develop in a rational manner, authority takes on a legal-rational form. Those who govern have the legitimate legal right to do so and those subordinated accept the legality of the rulers.

Albeit rational-legal authority may be challenged by those subordinated, it is unlikely to result in a quick change in the nature of the system. Such power struggles, according to Weber, are mostly political struggles and may be based on nationalism or ethnicity.

==The classification of authority in the context of history==
Weber also notes that legal domination is the most advanced, and that societies evolve from having mostly traditional and charismatic authorities to mostly rational and legal ones, because the instability of charismatic authority inevitably forces it to "routinize" into a more structured form of authority. Likewise he notes that in a pure type of traditional rule, sufficient resistance to a master can lead to a "traditional revolution". Thus he alludes to an inevitable move towards a rational-legal structure of authority, utilizing a bureaucratic structure. This ties to his broader concept of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] by suggesting the inevitability of a move in this direction. Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the [[social evolutionism]] theory.

In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the [[authority]] comes from [[tradition]], in charismatic authority from the personality and leadership qualities of the individual ([[charisma]]), and in legal (or rational-legal) authority from powers that are [[bureaucracy|bureaucratically]] and legally attached to certain positions. A classic example of these three types may be found in religion: [[priests]] (traditional), [[Jesus]] (charismatic), and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (legal-rational). Weber also conceived of these three types within his three primary modes of conflict: traditional authority within status groups, charismatic authority within [[social class|class]], and legal-rational authority within party organizations.

In his view every historical relation between rulers and ruled contained elements that can be analyzed on the basis of the above distinction.

The '''twenty-four kohanic gifts''' are a description in the [[Gemara]] tradition of offerings given to the Jewish priests.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Bavli: the Gemara: the classic Vilna edition Hersh Goldwurm - 2007 "A bechor is one of twenty-four "gifts" that the Torah awards to Kohanim (Rashi ; for a complete list of the twenty-four Kohanic gifts, see Gemara below, 110b)."&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective "kohanic" means "of a [[kohen]]", relating to a Jewish priest.

The [[Kohen|Kohanim]] were compensated for their service in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] - and to the nation - through twenty-four "priestly gifts".  The majority of these gifts were food items. Of these twenty-four gifts, ten gifts were given to the priests in the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], the "Holy House" (''beyth ha-miqdash''), four were to be consumed by the priests in [[Jerusalem]], and ten were to be given to the priests even outside the [[land of Israel]]. 

The gifts are usually not given today, when there is no Temple in Jerusalem. For example, most practising Jews today do not give first-born of their animals to modern Kohanim. Other practices may be followed, such as selling the mother animal to a non-Jew before it gives birth to the firstborn, and then buy back both the animal and its firstborn.&lt;ref&gt;Zeʾev Grinvald ''Shaarei Halachah: A Summary of Laws for Jewish Living'' (2001), pPage 384 "Firstborn male animals are one of the twenty-four gifts which were given to Kohanim. Many halachos apply to firstborn animals (e.g. one may not slaughter them, eat their meat, etc.). Today, when there is no Temple, first-born animals are not given to Kohanim, but it is customary to sell the mother cow, sheep, or goat to a non-Jew before she gives birth to her firstborn, and then buy back the mother and the firstborn."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gifts==
According to [[Tosefta]] Hallah, the ten gifts given in (or to be consumed in) the Temple area were portions of:{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}
:1. an animal brought as a [[sin offering]]
:2. [[guilt offering]]
:3. sacrifices of the communal [[Slaughter offering|peace offering]]
:4. a bird brought in as a sin offering
:5. the suspensive guilt offering&lt;ref&gt;Neusner ''The Comparative Hermeneutics of Rabbinic Judaism: Why this, not that?'' p115&lt;/ref&gt;
:6. the olive oil offering of a [[Leper|metzora]]&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Neusner ''Texts Without Boundaries: Sifra and Sifré to Numbers '' 2002 D. The [[sin offering]], guilt offering, sacrifices of peace offerings of the community, the hide of the burnt offering, the excess of the log of oil presented by the metzora, the excess of the sheaf of first barley, the two loaves and...&lt;/ref&gt;
:7. the two loaves of bread brought on [[Shavuot|Shavuot (first fruits)]]
:8. the [[showbread]]
:9. the left over portion of the [[meal offering]]
:10. the left over portion of grain from the offering of the [[Wave offering|first sheaf]], the [[Counting of the Omer|omer]] offering

Gifts given (or to be consumed) within the walls of Jerusalem were:
:11. firstborn of any domestic kosher animal
:12. [[First_Fruits#Hebrew_perspective|first fruits]]
:13. the inner organs of certain offerings, that which is removed from the [[Nazirite#Ending of the nazirite period|Nazirite offering]]
:14. the skins of certain offerings

Gifts which could be given (or consumed) outside Jerusalem were:
:15. [[Terumah|heave offering]] of a portion of the harvest
:16. [[Terumat hamaaser|heave offering of the tithe]] - a [[tithe]] of the Levite's tithe
:17. [[Challah|a portion of dough]]
:18. the first shearing of the sheep
:19. [[foreleg, cheeks and maw]] of all non-sanctified, ritually slaughtered domestic animals
:20. [[Pidyon haben|money given in exchange for redemption of a first-born son]] (Hebrew: ''pidyon haben'' פדיון הבן; redemption of the son) - in rabbinical practice five silver [[shekel]]s for the redemption of a firstborn [[Israelite]] son
:21. money (or a sheep or goat) redeemed in place of a firstborn donkey
:22. things declared [[Herem (priestly gift)|herem]], the hromim property or possession dedicated to the Temple without specifying to which use it is to be given
:23. inherited fields that were dedicated to the Temple and not reclaimed in the [[Jubilee (biblical)|Jubilee]] year
:24. that recovered which was stolen from a resident alien who has died, leaving no heirs

Females, who did not serve in the Tabernacle or the Temple, were permitted to consume and/or benefit from some of the twenty-four priestly gifts. But if a Kohen's daughter married a man from outside the Kohanic line, she was no longer permitted to benefit from the priestly gifts. Conversely, the daughter of a non-priest who married a priest took on the same rights as an unmarried daughter of a priest.

{{Distinguish|class (computer programming)}}

In [[computer science]], a '''type class''' is a [[type system]] construct that supports [[ad hoc polymorphism]]. This is achieved by adding constraints to type variables in [[parametric polymorphism|parametrically polymorphic]] types. Such a constraint typically involves a type class &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt; and a [[type variable]] &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, and means that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; can only be instantiated to a type whose members support the overloaded operations associated with &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;.

Type classes first appeared in the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell programming language]],&lt;ref&gt;"Type classes, first proposed during the design of the Haskell programming language, ..." —[http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jmorri14/pubs/morris-dissertation.pdf John Garrett Morris (2013), "Type Classes and Instance Chains: A Relational Approach" ]&lt;/ref&gt; and were originally conceived as a way of implementing [[operator overloading|overloaded arithmetic and equality operators]] in a principled fashion.&lt;ref name="kaes88parametric"&gt;{{cite conference

In contrast with the "eqtypes" of [[Standard ML]], overloading the equality operator through the use of type classes in Haskell does not require extensive modification of the compiler frontend or the underlying type system.&lt;ref name="appel91standard"&gt;{{cite conference

Since their creation, many other applications of type classes have been discovered.

== Overview ==
The programmer defines a type class by specifying a set of function or constant names, together with their respective types, that must exist for every type that belongs to the class. In Haskell, types can be parameterized; a type class &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; intended to contain types that admit equality would be declared in the following way:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
  (/=) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The type variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; has [[Kind (type theory)|kind]] &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; (also known as &lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt; in the latest [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]] release),&lt;ref&gt;[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.0.0/docs/Data-Kind.html#t:Type &lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt;] from &lt;code&gt;Data.Kind&lt;/code&gt; appeared in version 8 of the [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler]]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that the kind of &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; is

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
Eq :: Type -&gt; Constraint
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The declaration may be read as stating a "type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; belongs to type class &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; if there are functions named &lt;code&gt;(==)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;(/=)&lt;/code&gt;, of the appropriate types, defined on it." A programmer could then define a function &lt;code&gt;elem&lt;/code&gt; (which determines if an element is in a list) in the following way:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
elem :: Eq a =&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool
elem y []     = False
elem y (x:xs) = (x == y) || elem y xs
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The function &lt;code&gt;elem&lt;/code&gt; has the type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; with the context &lt;code&gt;Eq a&lt;/code&gt;, which constrains the types which &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; can range over to those &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; which belong to the &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; type class. (''Note'': Haskell &lt;code&gt; =&gt; &lt;/code&gt; can be called a 'class constraint'.)

A programmer can make any type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; a member of a given type class &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; by using an ''instance declaration'' that defines implementations of all of &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;'s methods for the particular type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;.  For instance, if a programmer defines a new data type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;, they may then make this new type an instance of &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; by providing an equality function over values of type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; in whatever way they see fit.  Once they have done this, they may use the function &lt;code&gt;elem&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;[t]&lt;/code&gt;, that is, lists of elements of type &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;.

Note that type classes are different from [[Class (computer science)|classes]] in object-oriented programming languages. In particular, &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt; is not a type: there is no such thing as a ''value'' of type &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt;.

Type classes are closely related to parametric polymorphism. For example, note that the type of &lt;code&gt;elem&lt;/code&gt; as specified above would be the parametrically polymorphic type &lt;code&gt;a -&amp;gt; [a] -&amp;gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt; were it not for the type class constraint "&lt;code&gt;Eq a =&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;".

== Higher-kinded polymorphism ==
A type class need not take a type variable of [[Kind (type theory)|kind]] &lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt; but can take one of any kind. These type classes with higher kinds are sometimes called constructor classes (the constructors referred to are type constructors such as &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, rather than data constructors such as &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt;). An example is the [[monad (functional programming)|&lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt;]] class:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
class Monad m where
  return :: a -&gt; m a
  (&gt;&gt;=)  :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The fact that m is applied to a type variable indicates that it has kind &lt;code&gt;Type -&gt; Type&lt;/code&gt;, i.e. it takes a type and returns a type, the kind of &lt;code&gt;Monad&lt;/code&gt; is thus:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
Monad :: (Type -&gt; Type) -&gt; Constraint
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Multi-parameter type classes ==
Type classes permit multiple type parameters, and so type classes can be seen as relations on types.&lt;ref&gt;[[Haskell']] page ''[http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime/wiki/MultiParamTypeClasses MultiParamTypeClasses]''.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]] standard library, the class &lt;code&gt;IArray&lt;/code&gt; expresses a general immutable array interface. In this class, the type class constraint &lt;code&gt;IArray a e&lt;/code&gt; means that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is an array type that contains elements of type &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt;. (This restriction on polymorphism is used to implement [[Object type (object-oriented programming)#Unboxing|unboxed]] array types, for example.)

Like [[multimethod]]s{{Citation needed|reason=Multimethod like lisp's one are evaluated at runtime, and haskell check types at compile time. Also, there is a thread on haskell mailing list (http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2007-August/030097.html) which seams to show that implementing static multimethod needs universal types.|date=June 2013}}, multi-parameter type classes support calling different implementations of a method depending on the types of multiple arguments, and indeed return types. &lt;!--They are more efficient than multimethods{{Citation needed|reason=This is a bold claim of specific implementations made without evidence. A multimethod implementation could cache the method implementation in much the same way as the proposed "method to call is stored in a dictionary" and avoid a search. It might also be using tracing JIT compilation to achieve even greater efficiency, though this technique could of course also apply to a type class. At best, any performance advantage here seems dependent on particular implementations, rather than being fundamental to the approach, and thus not particularly noteworthy. Type classes are an excellent concept – they have no need for inflated claims to justify them.|date=January 2017}} because they do not involve--&gt; Multi-parameter type classes do not require searching for the method to call on every call at runtime;&lt;ref&gt;In GHC, the C Core uses Girard &amp; Reynold's System F type signatures to identify a typed case for processing in the optimization phases. -- Simon Peyton-Jones "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR_VzYxvbxg Into the Core - Squeezing Haskell into Nine Constructors"] Erlang User Conference, Sep 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|minute 25:12}} rather the method to call is first compiled and stored in the dictionary of the type class instance, just as with single-parameter type classes.

Haskell code that uses multi-parameter type classes is not portable, as this feature is not part of the Haskell 98 standard.&lt;!-- outdated sentence, as Haskell 98 is not the most recent standard. --&gt; The popular Haskell implementations, GHC and [[Hugs]], support multi-parameter type classes.

== Functional dependencies ==
In Haskell, type classes have been refined to allow the programmer to declare functional dependencies between type parameters&amp;mdash;a concept [[functional dependency|inspired from relational database theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Jones. ''[http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/fundeps.html Type Classes with Functional Dependencies]''. From Proc. 9th European Symposium on Programming. March, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Haskell']] page ''[http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/haskell-prime/wiki/FunctionalDependencies FunctionalDependencies]''.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the programmer can assert that a given assignment of some subset of the type parameters uniquely determines the remaining type parameters. For example, general [[Monads in functional programming|monads]] &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; which carry a state parameter of type &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; satisfy the type class constraint &lt;code&gt;MonadState s m&lt;/code&gt;. In this constraint, there is a functional dependency &lt;code&gt;m -&gt; s&lt;/code&gt;. This means that for a given monad, the state type accessible from this interface is uniquely determined. This aids the compiler in [[type inference]], as well as aiding the programmer in [[type-directed programming]].

[[Simon Peyton-Jones]] has objected to the introduction of functional dependencies in Haskell on grounds of complexity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-prime/2006-February/000289.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Type classes and implicit parameters ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}

Type classes and implicit parameters are very similar in nature, although not quite the same.  A polymorphic function with a type class constraint such as:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="hs"&gt;sum :: Num a =&gt; [a] -&gt; a&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

can be intuitively treated as a function that implicitly accepts an instance of &lt;code&gt;Num&lt;/code&gt;:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="hs"&gt;sum_ :: Num_ a -&gt; [a] -&gt; a&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The instance &lt;code&gt;Num_ a&lt;/code&gt; is essentially a record that contains the instance definition of &lt;code&gt;Num a&lt;/code&gt;.  (This is in fact how type classes are implemented under the hood by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.)

However, there is a crucial difference: implicit parameters are more ''flexible'' – you can pass different instances of &lt;code&gt;Num Int&lt;/code&gt;.  In contrast, type classes enforce the so-called ''coherence'' property, which requires that there should only be one unique choice of instance for any given type.  The coherence property makes type classes somewhat antimodular, which is why orphan instances (instances that are defined in a module that neither contains the class nor the type of interest) are strongly discouraged.  On the other hand, coherence adds an additional level of safety to the language, providing the programmer a guarantee that two disjoint parts of the same code will share the same instance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIZxTQP1ifo Edward Kmett, ''Type Classes vs. the World'', Boston Haskell Meetup.]&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, an ordered [[set (abstract data type)|set]] (of type &lt;code&gt;Set a&lt;/code&gt;) requires a [[total order]]ing on the elements (of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;) in order to function.  This can be evidenced by a constraint &lt;code&gt;Ord a&lt;/code&gt;, which defines a comparison operator on the elements.  However, there can be numerous ways to impose a total order.  Since set algorithms are generally intolerant of changes in the ordering once a set has been constructed, passing an incompatible instance of &lt;code&gt;Ord a&lt;/code&gt; to functions that operate on the set may lead to incorrect results (or crashes).  Thus, enforcing coherence of &lt;code&gt;Ord a&lt;/code&gt; in this particular scenario is crucial.

Instances (or "dictionaries") in [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] type classes are just ordinary values in the language, rather than a completely separate kind of entity.&lt;ref name="scala-typeclasses"&gt;{{cite conference

As a result, Scala type classes do not satisfy the coherence property and are effectively a syntactic sugar for implicit parameters.

This is an example taken from the Cats &lt;ref&gt;[http://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses.html typelevel.org, Scala Cats]&lt;/ref&gt; documentation:

:&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="scala"&gt;
// A type class to provide textual representation
trait Show[A] {
  def show(f: A): String
}

// A polymorphic function that works only when there is an implicit 
// instance of Show[A] available
def log[A](a: A)(implicit s: Show[A]) = println(s.show(a))

// An instance for String
implicit val stringShow = new Show[String] {
  def show(s: String) = s
}

// The parameter stringShow was inserted by the compiler.
scala&gt; log("a string")
a string

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

[[Coq]] (version 8.2 onwards) also supports type classes by inferring the appropriate instances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labri.fr/perso/casteran/CoqArt/TypeClassesTut/typeclassestut.pdf A Gentle Introduction to Type Classes and Relations in Coq]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent versions of [[Agda (theorem prover)|Agda]] 2 also provide a similar feature, called "instance arguments".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php?n=ReferenceManual.ModellingTypeClassesWithInstanceArguments Modelling Type Classes With Instance Arguments]".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other approaches to operator overloading ==
In [[Standard ML]], the mechanism of "equality types" corresponds roughly to Haskell's built-in type class &lt;code&gt;Eq&lt;/code&gt;, but all equality operators are derived automatically by the compiler.  The programmer's control of the process is limited to designating which type components in a structure are equality types and which type variables in a polymorphic type range over equality types.

SML's and [[OCaml]]'s modules and functors can play a role similar to that of Haskell's type classes, the principal difference being the role of type inference, which makes type classes suitable for ''ad hoc'' polymorphism.&lt;ref name="dreyer06modular"&gt;{{cite journal

 | title = Modular Type Classes
 | booktitle = Technical Report TR-2006-03
 | date = April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The object oriented subset of [[OCaml]] is yet another approach which is somewhat comparable to the one of type classes.

== Related notions ==
An analogous notion for overloaded data (implemented in [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]]) is that of [[type family]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/Type_families&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rust (programming language)|Rust]] supports [[trait (computer programming)|traits]], which are a limited form of type classes with coherence.&lt;ref&gt;https://aturon.github.io/blog/2017/02/06/specialization-and-coherence/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mercury (programming language)|Mercury]] has typeclasses, although they are not exactly the same as in Haskell. {{Explain|date=May 2018}}

In [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], type classes are a [[programming idiom]] which can be implemented with existing language features such as implicit parameters, not a separate language feature per se. Because of the way they are implemented in Scala, it is possible to explicitly specify which type class instance to use for a type at a particular place in the code, in case of ambiguity. However, this is not necessarily a benefit as ambiguous type class instances can be error-prone.

The proof assistant [[Coq (proof assistant)|Coq]] has also supported type classes in recent versions. Unlike in ordinary programming languages, in Coq, any laws of a type class (such as the monad laws) that are stated within the type class definition, must be mathematically proved of each type class instance before using them.

'''United4Iran''' advocates for an end to [[human rights]] violations in [[Iran]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol%3DA%2F67%2F369%26referer%3D%2Fenglish%2F%26Lang%3DE |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305045148/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2F67%2F369&amp;referer=%2Fenglish%2F&amp;Lang=E |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and supports the movement for genuine democratic reform in the country. United for Iran works to raise awareness about human rights abuses and mobilizes pressure on the Iranian government to uphold human rights principles outlined in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml|title=The Universal Declaration of Human Rights|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; United for Iran undertakes programs and campaigns that aim to advance accountability for violations against Iranian citizens and increase the cost for human rights abuses.
Among its policy agenda, United for Iran calls on the Iranian government to:
• Release [[political prisoners]].
• End all restrictions that prevent citizens from accessing information and the Internet freely.
• Reform its laws and practices to adhere to international standards established in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], including the promotion of [[gender equality]]; respect for [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of expression]], and [[freedom of religion]]; and ensuring freedom from torture, arbitrary detention, and extrajudicial execution.
• Institute electoral and democratic reforms and hold genuine democratic elections open to international electoral observation.
• Establish a moratorium on the [[death penalty]] until due process rights are guaranteed and with a view toward joining the global movement toward abolition.
To advance this agenda, United for Iran will pursue the following objectives: contribute to NGO coalition-building and collaboration among organizations that work on human rights promotion in Iran; encourage cooperation by the Iranian government with the international human rights system; and exert international pressure on the Iranian government to carry about the above human rights objectives.
United for Iran is an independent non-profit organization formed in 2009 after the [[2009–2010 Iranian election protests]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/world/middleeast/30iran.html|title=Iran Lashes Out at West Over Protests|first=Nazila|last=Fathi|authorlink=Nazila Fathi|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group organized the July 25th, 2009, Global Day of Action for Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.amnestyusa.org/tag/united4iran/|title=United4Iran - Human Rights Now|work=amnestyusa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the support of major human rights organizations and several [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winners, including [[Desmund Tutu]], [[Shirin Ebadi]], and [[Jody Williams]], the impetus for the Global Day of Action spread around the world, gathering momentum as a grassroots movement in over 110 cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://united4iran.org/category/events/july-25th-gda/about-gda/United4Iran About July 25, 2009]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its first Global Day of Action, United4Iran has coordinated several more international days of action, including one for International Human Rights Day (2009), two to mark the anniversaries of Iran's disputed 2009 election (2010 and 2011), and one for Iran's Student Day (2010). 

United4Iran has partnered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://united4iran.org/about/supporters/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526235440/http://united4iran.org/about/supporters/ |archivedate=May 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with several prominent human rights organizations, activists, and NGOs, including
