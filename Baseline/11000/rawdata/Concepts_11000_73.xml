In [[electromagnetics]], an antenna's '''power gain''' or simply '''gain''' is a key performance number which combines the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]'s [[directivity]] and [[antenna efficiency|electrical efficiency]].  In a transmitting antenna, the gain describes how well the antenna converts input power into [[radio wave]]s headed in a specified direction. In a receiving antenna, the gain describes how well the antenna converts radio waves arriving from a specified direction into electrical power. When no direction is specified, "gain" is understood to refer to the peak value of the gain, the gain in the direction of the antenna's [[main lobe]].  A plot of the gain as a function of direction is called the [[radiation pattern]].

Antenna gain is usually defined as the ratio of the power produced by the antenna from a [[far-field]] source on the antenna's beam axis to the power produced by a hypothetical lossless ''[[Isotropic radiator#Antenna theory|isotropic antenna]]'', which is equally sensitive to signals from all directions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = IEEE Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=286098|journal = IEEE Std 145-1993|date = 1993-07-01|pages = 1–32|doi = 10.1109/IEEESTD.1993.119664|isbn = 978-0-7381-0555-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually this ratio is expressed in [[decibels]], and these units are referred to as "''decibels-isotropic''" (dBi). An alternative definition compares the received power to the power received by a lossless [[dipole antenna|half-wave dipole antenna]], in which case the units are written as ''dBd''.  Since a lossless dipole antenna has a gain of 2.15 dBi,  the relation between these units is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Gain(dBd)} = \mathrm{Gain(dBi)} - 2.15&lt;/math&gt; For a given frequency, the antenna's [[effective area]] is proportional to the power gain. An antenna's [[Antenna aperture#Effective length|effective length]] is proportional to the ''square root'' of the antenna's gain for a particular frequency and [[radiation resistance]]. Due to [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|reciprocity]], the gain of any reciprocal antenna when receiving is equal to its gain when transmitting.

[[Directive gain]] or [[directivity]] is a different measure which does ''not'' take an antenna's electrical efficiency into account. This term is sometimes more relevant in the case of a receiving antenna where one is concerned mainly with the ability of an antenna to receive signals from one direction while rejecting interfering signals coming from a different direction.

==Power gain==

'''Power gain''' (or simply '''gain''') is a unitless measure that combines an antenna's [[antenna efficiency|efficiency]] ''E&lt;sub&gt;antenna&lt;/sub&gt;'' and [[directivity]] ''D'':

:&lt;math&gt;G = E_{antenna} \cdot D.&lt;/math&gt;
The notions of efficiency and directivity depend on the following.

===Efficiency===

A transmitting antenna accepts '''input power''' &lt;math&gt;P_{in}&lt;/math&gt; at some point along the [[feedline]].  The point is typically taken to be at the antenna (the ''feedpoint''), thereby not counting power lost due to [[joule heating]] in the feedline and reflections back down the feedline.  The '''efficiency''' &lt;math&gt;E_{antenna}&lt;/math&gt; of an antenna is the '''[[Antenna gain#Total radiated power|total radiated power]]''' &lt;math&gt;P_o&lt;/math&gt; divided by the input power at the feedpoint
:&lt;math&gt;E_{antenna} = {P_o \over P_{in}}&lt;/math&gt;
The electromagnetic [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|reciprocity theorem]] guarantees that the electrical properties of an antenna, such as efficiency, directivity, and gain, are the same when the antenna is used for receiving as when it is transmitting.

===Directivity===

Antennas are invariably directional to a greater or lesser extent, according to how the output power is distributed in any given direction in [[three dimensions]].  We shall specify direction here in [[spherical coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the '''altitude''' or angle above a specified reference plane (such as the ground), while &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the '''azimuth''' as the angle between the projection of the given direction onto the reference plane and a specified reference direction (such as north or east) in that plane with specified sign (either clockwise or counterclockwise).

The distribution of output power as a function of the possible directions &lt;math&gt;(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; is given by its [[radiation intensity]] &lt;math&gt;U(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; (in [[SI units]]: watts per steradian, W⋅sr&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).  The output power is obtained from the radiation intensity by integrating the latter over all solid angles &lt;math&gt;d\Omega = \cos\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;P_o =\int_{-\pi}^\pi\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}U(\theta,\phi) \, d\Omega = \int_{-\pi}^\pi\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}U(\theta,\phi) \cos \theta \, d\theta \, d\phi.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''mean radiation intensity''' &lt;math&gt;\overline U&lt;/math&gt; is therefore given by
:&lt;math&gt;\overline U =\frac{P_o}{4\pi}~~&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; since there are 4&amp;pi; steradians in a sphere
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;=\frac{E_{antenna}\cdot P_{in}}{4\pi}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; using the first formula for &lt;math&gt;P_o&lt;/math&gt;.

The directive gain or '''directivity''' &lt;math&gt;D(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; of an antenna in a given direction is the ratio of its radiation intensity &lt;math&gt;U(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; in that direction to its mean radiation intensity &lt;math&gt;\overline U&lt;/math&gt;.  That is,

:&lt;math&gt;D(\theta,\phi)=\frac{U(\theta,\phi)}{\overline U}.&lt;/math&gt;
An isotropic antenna, meaning one with the same radiation intensity in all directions, therefore has directivity 1 in all directions independently of its efficiency.  More generally the maximum, minimum, and mean directivities of any antenna are always at least 1, at most 1, and exactly 1.  For the [[half-wave dipole]] the respective values are 1.64 (2.15 [[Decibel|dB]]), 0, and 1.

When the directivity &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of an antenna is given independently of direction it refers to its maximum directivity in any direction, namely
:&lt;math&gt;D=\max_{\theta, \, \phi}D(\theta,\phi).&lt;/math&gt;

===Gain===

The power gain or simply '''gain''' &lt;math&gt;G(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; of an antenna in a given direction takes efficiency into account by being defined as the ratio of its radiation intensity &lt;math&gt;U(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; in that direction to the mean radiation intensity of a perfectly efficient antenna.  Since the latter equals &lt;math&gt;P_{in}/4\pi&lt;/math&gt;, it is therefore given by

:&lt;math&gt;G(\theta,\phi)=\frac{U(\theta,\phi)}{P_{in}/4\pi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;=E_{antenna}\cdot\frac{U(\theta,\phi)}{\overline U}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; using the second equation for &lt;math&gt;\overline U&lt;/math&gt;
:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;=E_{antenna}\cdot D(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; using the equation for &lt;math&gt;D(\theta,\phi).&lt;/math&gt;

As with directivity, when the gain &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of an antenna is given independently of direction it refers to its maximum gain in any direction.   Since the only difference between gain and directivity in any direction is a constant factor of &lt;math&gt;E_{antenna}&lt;/math&gt; independent of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the fundamental formula of this section:

:&lt;math&gt;G=E_{antenna}\cdot D.&lt;/math&gt;

===Summary===

If only a certain portion of the electrical power received from the transmitter is actually radiated by the antenna (i.e. less than 100% efficiency), then the directive gain compares the power radiated in a given direction to that reduced power (instead of the total power received), ignoring the inefficiency. The directivity is therefore the maximum directive gain when taken over all directions, and is always ''at least'' 1.  On the other hand, the power gain takes into account the poorer efficiency by comparing the radiated power in a given direction to the actual power that the antenna receives from the transmitter, which makes it a more useful figure of merit for the antenna's contribution to the ability of a transmitter in sending a radio wave toward a receiver.  In every direction, the power gain of an isotropic antenna is equal to the efficiency, and hence is always ''at most'' 1, though it can and ideally should exceed 1 for a [[directional antenna]].

Note that in the case of an [[impedance matching|impedance mismatch]], ''P&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'' would be computed as the transmission line's incident power minus reflected power. Or equivalently, in terms of the rms voltage ''V'' at the antenna terminals:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{in} = V^2 \cdot Re \left\lbrace \frac{1}{Z_{in}} \right\rbrace&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Z&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Antenna (radio)#Impedance|feedpoint impedance]].

==Gain in decibels==
Published numbers for antenna gain are almost always expressed in [[decibels]] (dB), a logarithmic scale.  From the gain factor G, one finds the gain in decibels as:
:&lt;math&gt;G_{dBi} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}\left(G\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, an antenna with a peak power gain of 5 would be said to have a gain of 7 dBi. "dBi" is used rather than just "dB" to emphasize that this is the gain according to the basic definition, in which the antenna is compared to an isotropic radiator.

When actual measurements of an antenna's gain are made by a laboratory, the field strength of the test antenna is measured when supplied with, say, 1 watt of transmitter power, at a certain distance. That field strength is compared to the field strength found using a so-called ''reference antenna'' at the same distance receiving the same power in order to determine the gain of the antenna under test. That ratio would be equal to G if the reference antenna were an isotropic radiator(irad).

However a true isotropic radiator cannot be built, so in practice a different antenna is used. This will often be a half-wave dipole, a very well understood and repeatable antenna that can be easily built for any frequency. The directive gain of a half-wave dipole is known to be 1.64 and it can be made nearly 100% efficient. Since the gain has been measured with respect to this reference antenna, the difference in the gain of the test antenna is often compared to that of the dipole. The "gain relative to a dipole" is thus often quoted and is denoted using "dBd" instead of "dBi" to avoid confusion. Therefore, in terms of the true gain (relative to an isotropic radiator) G, this figure for the gain is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;G_{dBd} = 10 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{G}{1.64}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, the above antenna with a gain G=5 would have a gain with respect to a dipole of 5/1.64 = 3.05, or in decibels one would call this 10&amp;nbsp;log(3.05) = 4.84&amp;nbsp;dBd. In general:
:&lt;math&gt;G_{dBd} = G_{dBi} - 2.15dB &lt;/math&gt;
Both dBi and dBd are in common use. When an antenna's maximum gain is specified in decibels (for instance, by a manufacturer) one must be certain as to whether this means the gain relative to an isotropic radiator or with respect to a dipole. If it specifies "dBi" or "dBd" then there is no ambiguity, but if only "dB" is specified then the fine print must be consulted. Either figure can be easily converted into the other using the above relationship.

Note that when considering an antenna's directional pattern, "gain with respect to a dipole" does ''not'' imply a comparison of that antenna's gain in each direction to a dipole's gain in that direction. Rather, it is a comparison between the antenna's gain in each direction to the ''peak'' gain of the dipole (1.64). In any direction, therefore, such numbers are 2.15&amp;nbsp;dB smaller than the gain expressed in dBi.

==Partial gain==
'''Partial gain''' is calculated as power gain, but for a particular [[Antenna (radio)#Polarization|polarization]].  It is defined as the part of the [[radiation intensity]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to a given polarization, divided by the total radiation intensity of an isotropic antenna.

:&lt;math&gt;G_{\theta} = 4\pi\left(\frac{U_\theta}{P_{\mathrm{in}}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G_{\phi} = 4\pi\left(\frac{U_\phi}{P_{\mathrm{in}}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U_{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U_{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; represent the radiation intensity in a given direction contained in their respective E field component.

As a result of this definition, we can conclude that the total gain of an antenna is the sum of partial gains for any two orthogonal polarizations.

:&lt;math&gt;G = G_{\theta} + G_{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;

==Example calculation==
Suppose a lossless antenna has a radiation pattern given by:

:&lt;math&gt;U = B_0\,\sin^3(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

Let us find the gain of such an antenna.

'''Solution''':

First we find the peak radiation intensity of this antenna:

:&lt;math&gt; U_{\mathrm{max}} = B_0&lt;/math&gt;

The total radiated power can be found by integrating over all directions:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{rad}} = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi}U(\theta,\phi)\sin(\theta) \, d\theta \,d\phi = 2 \pi B_0 \int_0^{\pi}\sin^4(\theta) \, d\theta = B_0\left(\frac{3\pi^2}{4} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;D = 4\pi\left(\frac{U_{\mathrm{max}}}{P_{\mathrm{rad}}}\right) = 4\pi\left[\frac{B_0}{B_0\left(\frac{3\pi^2}{4}\right)}\right] = \frac{16}{3\pi} = 1.698&lt;/math&gt;

Since the antenna is specified as being lossless the radiation efficiency is 1. The maximum gain is then equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;G = E_{antenna} \, D = (1)(1.698) = 1.698&lt;/math&gt; .

:&lt;math&gt;G_{dBi} = 10 \, \log_{10}(1.698) = 2.30 \, \mathrm{dBi}&lt;/math&gt;

Expressed relative to the gain of a half-wave dipole we would find:

:&lt;math&gt;G_{dBd} = 10 \, \log_{10}(1.698/1.64) = 0.15 \, \mathrm{dBd}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Realized Gain ==
According to IEEE Standard 145-1993,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; '''Realized Gain''' differs from the above definitions of gain in that it is "reduced by the losses due to the mismatch of the antenna input impedance to a specified impedance."  This mismatch induces losses above the dissipative losses described above; therefore, Realized Gain will always be less than Gain.

Gain may be expressed as '''absolute gain''' if further clarification is required to differentiate it from Realized Gain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Total radiated power (TRP)==
'''Total radiated power''' is the sum of all RF power radiated by the antenna when the source power is included in the measurement.  TRP is expressed in Watts, or equivalent logarithmic expressions, often dBm or dBW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ctia.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/ctia_ota_test_plan_rev_3_4_2.pdf?sfvrsn=2|title = CTIA Test Plan for Wireless Device Over-the-Air Performance Rev. 3.4.2|date = May 2015|accessdate = |website = Certification Test Plans|publisher = CTIA|last = |first = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160216175131/http://www.ctia.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/ctia_ota_test_plan_rev_3_4_2.pdf?sfvrsn=2|archivedate = 2016-02-16|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TRP can be measured while in the close proximity of power-absorbing losses such as the body and hand of the Mobile Device Under Test User.&lt;ref name="Ref_a"&gt;Mobile Broadband Multimedia Networks: Techniques, Models and Tools for 4G by Luís M. Correia&lt;/ref&gt;

The TRP can be used to determine Body Loss (BoL). The Body Loss is considered as the ratio of TRP measured in the presence of losses and TRP measured while in free space.

'''Aparoksha'''  ([[Sanskrit]]: अपरोक्ष), a Sanskrit adjective meaning not invisible or perceptible,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit de.|url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B7&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to direct intuitive [[Vidya (Knowledge)|knowledge]] which is one of the seven stages of knowledge or conditions of [[Chidabhasa]], the first three being the sources of bondage and the rest four being the processes of liberation; and to the continuation of the deepening of conventional knowledge. It removes sorrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of the Panchdasi|author=Swami Krishnanda|publisher=The Divine Life Society|url= http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/panch/panch_07.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Indian Philosophy]], the three traditional kinds of knowledge are – ''[[pratyaksha]]'' (empirical), ''[[paroksha]]'' (conventional, universal) and ''aparoksha'' (transcendental).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Eastern Anthropologist, Vol.49| publisher= Ethnographic and Folk Culture Society|page=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5oiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=aproksha&amp;dq=aproksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RwW-U7yeHY25uATW4YH4AQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwCQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aparoksha'' is the highest kind of knowledge which cannot be gained without the practice of morality that converts ''paroksha'' knowledge from which unity of existence is derived. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Five years of Theosophy| publisher= Theosophical Pub.

Aparoksha is ''[[savikalpa]] jnana'' (knowledge) when one re-recognizes the non-dual nature of the ever-realized Self ([[Tat Tvam Asi]]), it is the immediate knowledge gained through the ''[[pramana]]s''; practice of ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]]'' (meditation) removes all ''vikalpas'' (varied thoughts) and leads to ''[[nirvikalpa]]'' or the thoughtless state, which is the highest experience, the immediate realization of Truth. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Wisdom of Sri Dattatreya|author =K.N.Subramanian| publisher= Sura Books| pages= 80,81| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=wbeg45SMdagC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=aproksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RwW-U7yeHY25uATW4YH4AQ&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=aproksha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the method of cessation from individual and collective perception leading to the position of neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyber temple of the Beautiful Lord – The Bhagavata|url= http://www.mahaprabhu.net/bhag2.html  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sarvam khalvidam Brahman'' (all this is Brahman) is ''paroksha'' knowledge, but the understanding  that ''[[Aham Brahman Asmi]]'' (I am Brahman) is ''aparoksha'' knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self Knowledge|url= http://www.vijnana.org/2009/04/shravanammananamnidhidhyasanam.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Attentional control''' refers to an individual's capacity to choose what they pay [[attention]] to and what they ignore.&lt;ref name="Astle_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Astle | first1 = D. E. | last2 = Scerif | first2 = G. | year = 2009 | title = Using Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience to Study Behavioral and Attentional Control | url = | journal = Developmental Psychobiology | volume = 51 | issue = 2| pages = 107–118 | doi = 10.1002/dev.20350 | pmid = 18973175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also known as [[endogeny|endogenous]] attention or [[executive functions|executive]] attention. In lay terms, attentional control can be described as an individual's ability to concentrate. Primarily mediated by the [[frontal lobes|frontal]] areas of the brain including the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], attentional control is thought to be closely related to other [[executive functions]] such as [[working memory]].&lt;ref name="posner_peterson_1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Posner | first1 = M.

==General overview of research==
Sources of attention in our brain create a system of three networks: [[alertness]] (maintaining awareness), orientation (information from sensory input), and executive control (resolving conflict).&lt;ref name="posner_peterson_1990" /&gt; These three networks have been studied using experimental designs involving adults, children, and monkeys, with and without abnormalities of attention.&lt;ref name="Fan 2002 340–347"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fan|first=Jan|author2=Et. al.|title=Testing the Efficiency and Interdependence of Attenional Networks|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|year=2002|volume=14|issue=3|pages=340–347|doi=10.1162/089892902317361886|pmid=11970796}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research designs include the [[Stroop effect|Stroop task]]
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markman|first=Art|title=Disgust, Morality, and Attention|journal=Ulterior Motives|date=11 September 2012|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ulterior-motives/201209/disgust-morality-and-attention|accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eriksen flanker task|flanker task]], which study executive control with analysis techniques including event-related [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional magnetic resonance image]] (fMRI). While some research designs focus specifically on one aspect of attention (such as executive control), others experiments view several areas, which examine interactions between the alerting, orienting, and executive control networks.&lt;ref name="Fan 2002 340–347"/&gt; More recently, the Attention Network Test (ANT), designed by Fan and Posner, has been used to obtain efficiency measures of the three networks, and allow their relationships to be examined. It was designed as a behavioural task simple enough to obtain data from children, patients, and animals.&lt;ref name="Fan 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fan|first=J.|author2=McCandliss, B. |author3=Sommer, T. |author4=Raz, A. |author5=Posner, M. |title=Testing the efficiency and independence of attentional networks|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=2002|volume=14|issue=3|pages=340–347|doi=10.1162/089892902317361886 |pmid=11970796}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task requires participants to quickly respond to cues given on a computer screen, while having their attention fixated on a center target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adólfsdóttir|first=Steinunn|author2=Et. al.|title=The Attention Network Test: A Characteristic Pattern of Deficits in Children with ADHD|journal=Behavioral and Brain Functions|year=2008|url=http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/4/1/9|accessdate=20 October 2012|doi=10.1186/1744-9081-4-9|volume=4|pages=9|pmid=18269768|pmc=2265730|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
{{see also|Neurobiological effects of physical exercise#Cognitive control and memory}}

===Infancy===
Early researchers studying the development of the [[frontal cortex]] thought that it was functionally silent during the first year of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bell | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Wolfe | first2 = C. D. | year = 2007 | title = Changes in brain functioning from infancy to early childhood: Evidence from EEG power and coherence during working memory tasks | url = | journal = Developmental Neuropsychology | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 21–38 | doi = 10.1207/s15326942dn3101_2 | pmid = 17305436 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, early research suggested that infants aged one year or younger are completely passive in the allocation of their attention, and have no capacity to choose what they pay attention to and what they ignore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colombo | first1 = J | year = 2001 | title = The development of visual attention in infancy | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 337–367 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.337 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is shown, for example, in the phenomenon of 'sticky fixation', whereby infants are incapable of disengaging their attention from a particularly [[Salience (neuroscience)|salient]] target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hood | first1 = B. M. | last2 = Atkinson | first2 = J. | year = 1993 | title = DISENGAGING VISUAL-ATTENTION IN THE INFANT AND ADULT | url = | journal = Infant Behavior &amp; Development | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 405–422 | doi=10.1016/0163-6383(93)80001-o}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has suggested, however, that even very young infants do have some capacity to exercise control over their allocation of attention, albeit in a much more limited sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = M. H. | year = 1995 | title = THE INHIBITION OF AUTOMATIC SACCADES IN EARLY INFANCY | url = | journal = Developmental Psychobiology | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 281–291 | doi=10.1002/dev.420280504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colombo | first1 = J. | last2 = Cheatham | first2 = C. L. | year = 2006 | title = The emergence and basis of endogenous attention in infancy and early childhood | url = | journal = Advances in Child Development and Behavior | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 283–322 | doi=10.1016/s0065-2407(06)80010-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===
As the [[frontal lobes]] mature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gogtay | first1 = N. | last2 = Giedd | first2 = J. N. | last3 = Lusk | first3 = L. | last4 = Hayashi | first4 = K. M. | last5 = Greenstein | first5 = D. | last6 = Vaituzis | first6 = A. C. | last7 = Nugent Iii | first7 = T. F. | last8 = Herman | first8 = D. H. | last9 = Clasen | first9 = L.

C. | last2 = Amso | first2 = D. | last3 = Cruess Anderson | first3 = L. | last4 = Diamond | first4 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Development of cognitive control and executive functions from 4 to 13 years: Evidence from manipulations of memory, inhibition, and task switching | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 44 | issue = 11| pages = 2037–2078 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.02.006 | pmid = 16580701 | pmc = 1513793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some children show impaired development of attentional control abilities, thought to arise from the relatively slower development of frontal areas of the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shaw | first1 = P. Lerch | last2 = Greenstein | first2 = D. | last3 = Sharp | first3 = W. | last4 = Clasen | first4 = L. | last5 = Evans | first5 = A. | last6 = Giedd | first6 = J. | last7 = Xavier Castellanos | first7 = F. | last8 = Rapoport | first8 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Longitudinal Mapping of Cortical Thickness and Clinical Outcome in Children and Adolescents With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder | url = | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 540–549 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.5.540 | pmid=16651511}}&lt;/ref&gt; which sometimes results in a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

===Elderly===
Some studies of aging and cognition focus on working memory processes and declines in attentional control. One study used fMRI measures during a Stroop task comparing neural activity of attentional control in younger (21–27 years) and older participants (60–75 years). Conditions included increased competition and increased conflict. Results showed evidence of decreases in responsiveness in brain areas associated with attentional control for the older group. This result suggests that older people may have decreases in their ability to utilize attentional control in their everyday lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milham|first=M.|author2=Erickson, K. |author3=Banich, M. |author4=Kramer, A. |author5=Webb, A. |author6=Wszalek, T. |author7=Cohen, N. |title=Attentional control in the aging brain: Insights from an fMRI study of the stroop task|journal=Brain Cogn.|date=2002|volume=49|issue=3|pages=277–296 |doi=10.1006/brcg.2001.1501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banich 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Banich|first=M.|title=Executive function: The search for an integrated account|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=2009|volume=18|pages=89–94|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01615.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abnormal development==

Disrupted attentional control has been noted not just in the early development of conditions for which the core deficit is related to attention such as ADHD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sonuga-Barke | first1 = E. J. S. | last2 = Koerting | first2 = J. | last3 = Smith | first3 = E. | last4 = McCann | first4 = D.

A. | last2 = Nix | first2 = R. L. | last3 = Blair | first3 = C. | last4 = Bierman | first4 = K. L. | last5 = Nelson | first5 = K.

The patterns of disrupted attentional control relate to findings of disrupted performance on [[executive functions]] tasks such as [[working memory]] across a wide number of different disorder groups.&lt;ref name="Astle_2009" /&gt; The question of why the [[executive functions]] appear to be disrupted across so many different disorder groups remains, however, poorly understood.

===Relevance to mental illness===
Studies have shown that there is a high probability that those who suffer from low attentional control also experience other mental conditions. Low attentional control is more common among those with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD),"a disorder with persistent age-inappropriate symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that are sufficient to cause impairment in major life activities".&lt;ref name="Mash"&gt;Mash, Eric, J. (2013). Abnormal Child Psychology. Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Also low attentional control is common in individuals with [[Schizophrenia]] and &lt;ref name="Durham 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Durham|first=N.C.|title=New Study Identifies Brain Centers For Attention Control|journal=ScienceDaily|date=24 February 2000|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/02/000224075505.htm|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alzheimer's disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coubard|first=Olivier|author2=Et. al.|title=Attentional Control in Normal Aging and Alzheimer's Disease|journal=Neuropsychology|date=May 2011|volume=25|issue=3|pages=353–367|doi=10.1037/a0022058|pmid=21417533}}&lt;/ref&gt; those with [[social anxiety]], [[trait anxiety]], and [[Mood disorder|depression]],&lt;ref name="Bowler 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowler|first=Jennifer|author2=Et. at.|title=A Comparison of Cognitive Bias Modification for Interpretation and Computerized Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Effects on Anxiety, Depression, Attentional Control, and Interpretive Bias|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|date=10 September 2012|doi=10.1037/a0029932|volume=80|issue=6|pages=1021–33|pmid=22963595|pmc=3516492}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attention difficulties following a stroke.&lt;ref name="Durham 2000"/&gt; Individuals also respond quicker, and have better overall executive control when they have low levels of anxiety and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarter|first=Martin|author2=Giovanna Paolone|title=Deficits in Attentional Control: Cholinergic Mechanisms and Circuitry-Based Treatment Approaches|journal=Behavioral Neuroscience|date=December 2011|volume=125|issue=6|pages=825–835|doi=10.1037/a0026227|pmc=3235713|pmid=22122146}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Low levels of attentional control are also thought to increase chances of developing a psychopathology because the ability to shift one’s focus away from threat information is important in processing emotions.&lt;ref name="Fergus 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fergus|first=Thomas|author2=Et. al.|title=Attentional Control Moderates the Relationship between Activation of the Cognitive Attentional Syndrome and Symptoms of Psychopathology|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=August 2012|volume=53|issue=3|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2012.03.017|pages=213–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More researchers are also accounting for attentional control in studies that might not necessarily focus on attention by having participants fill out an Attentional Control Scale (ACS)&lt;ref name="Bowler 2012"/&gt; or a Cognitive Attentional Syndrome-1 (CAS1),&lt;ref name="Fergus 2012"/&gt; both of which are self-reporting questionnaires measuring attention focusing and attention shifting.&lt;ref name="Bowler 2012"/&gt; Researchers are also suggesting others in the field use experimental and longitudinal designs to address the relationship between ACS, emotional functioning, CAS, and attention to threat. This is due to the increasing problematic occurrences experts are seeing in the field regarding attentional control in relation to other mental illnesses.&lt;ref name="Durham 2000"/&gt;

Attention problems are also characteristic of anxiety disorders like PTSD. Attentional bias causes a person to processes emotionally negative information preferentially over emotionally positive information. Participants were selected after being measured on scales for PTSD, anxiety proneness, attentional control, and attentional bias. Results indicated attentional control was inversely related to attentional bias. PTSD patients with higher attentional control exhibited less attentional bias. Individual differences in attentional control had an effect on anxiety problems in PTSD.&lt;ref name="Schoorl 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schoorl|first=M. |author2=Putman, P. |author3=Van Der Werff, S. |author4=Van Der Does A. |title=Attentional bias and attentional control in posttraumatic stress disorder|journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders|date=2014|volume=28|pages=203–210|doi=10.1016/j.janxdis.2013.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Performance===

Attentional control theory focuses on anxiety and cognitive performance. The assumption of this theory is that the effects of anxiety on attentional control are key to understanding the relationship between anxiety and performance. In general, anxiety inhibits attentional control on a specific task by impairing processing efficiency.&lt;ref name="Eysenck 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eysenck|first=M.|author2=Kerakshan, N. |author3=Santos, R. |author4=Galvo, M. |title=Anxiety and cognitive performance: Attentional control theory|journal=Emotion|date=2007|volume=7|issue=2|pages=336–353 |doi=10.1037/1528-3542.7.2.336}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three functions associated with this theory. The inhibition function prevents stimuli unrelated to a task and responses from disrupting performance. The shifting function is used to allocate attention to the stimuli that are most relevant to the task. The updating function is used to update and monitor information in working memory.&lt;ref name="Eysenck 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miyake 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miyake|first=A.|author2=Priedman, N. |author3=Emerson, M. |author4=Witzki, A. |author5=Howerter, A. |title=The unity and diversity of executive functions and their contributions to complex "frontal lobe" tasks: A latent variable analysis|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=2000|volume=41|pages=49–100 |doi=10.1006/cogp.1999.0734 |pmid=10945922 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three main hypotheses associated with attentional control theory. First, the efficiency of the central executive is impaired by anxiety. Second, anxiety impairs the inhibition function, and third, anxiety impairs the shifting function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eysenck|first=M.|author2=Derakshan, N.|title=New perspectives in attentional control theory|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=2011|volume=50|pages=955–960|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.08.019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	Studies related to attentional control and performance take two differing approaches. Specifically, research on attentional capture has two modes: voluntary and reflexive. The voluntary mode is a top down approach where attention is shifted according to high-level cognitive processes. The reflexive mode is a bottom up approach where attention shifts involuntarily based on a stimulus’s attention attracting properties.&lt;ref name="Pashler 2001" /&gt; These modes are important to understanding how attentional control works.

===Mindfulness===
Even four days of [[mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] meditation training can significantly improve visuo-spatial processing, working memory and executive functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chiesa|first=A.|author2=Serretti, A.|title=A systematic review of neurobiological and clinical features of mindfulness meditations|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=27 November 2009|volume=40|issue=8|pages=1239–1252|doi=10.1017/S0033291709991747|pmid=19941676}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeidan|first=Fadel|author2=Johnson, Susan K.|author3= Diamond, Bruce J.|author4= David, Zhanna|author5= Goolkasian, Paula|title=Mindfulness meditation improves cognition: Evidence of brief mental training|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=1 June 2010|volume=19|issue=2|pages=597–605|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.03.014|pmid=20363650}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research has indicated that mindfulness does not affect attentional control directly. Participants did tasks of sustained attention, inhibition, switching, and object detection. These tasks were done before and after an 8-week mindfulness based stress reduction course (MBSR), and were compared to a control group. There were no significant differences between the groups, meaning that the MBSR course did not affect attentional control.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2007" /&gt; Mindfulness influences non-directed attention and other things like emotional well-being.&lt;ref name="Anderson 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=N.|author2=Lau, M. |author3=Segal, Z. |author4=Bishop, S. |title=Mindfulness-based stress reduction and attentional control|journal=Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy|date=2007|volume=14|pages=449–463 |doi=10.1002/cpp.544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning===
[[Modularity of mind|Modular]] approaches view cognitive development as a [[mosaic]]-like process, according to which [[cognitive]] faculties develop separately according to genetically predetermined maturational timetables. Prominent authors who take a modular approach to cognitive development include [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Elizabeth Spelke]] and [[Steven Pinker]]. In contrast, other authors such as [[Annette Karmiloff-Smith]], [[Mark H. Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] and [http://psych.indiana.edu/faculty/smith4.php Linda Smith] have instead advocated taking a more [[interactive specialization|interactive]] or [[dynamical systems]] approaches to cognitive development. According to these approaches, which are known as [[neuroconstructivism|neuroconstructivist]] approaches, cognitive systems interact over developmental time as certain cognitive faculties are required for the subsequent acquisition of other faculties in other areas.

Amongst authors who take [[neuroconstructivism|neuroconstructivist]] approaches to development, particular importance has been attached to attentional control, since it is thought to be a domain-general process that may influence the subsequent acquisition of other skills in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scerif | first1 = G. | year = 2010| title = Attention trajectories, mechanisms and outcomes: at the interface between developing cognition and environment | url = | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 805–812 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2010.01013.x | pmid = 20977552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to regulate and direct attention releases the child from the constraints of only responding to environmental events, and means they are able actively to guide their attention towards the information-rich areas key for [[learning]]. For example, a number of authors have looked at the relationship between an infants' capacity to exercise attentional control and their subsequent performance during [[language acquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kannass | first1 = K.

Working memory capacity has been studied to understand how memory functions. The ability to predict the effectiveness of someone’s working memory capacity comes from attentional control mechanisms. These mechanisms help with the regulation of goals, behavior, and outside distractions, which are all important for effective learning.&lt;ref name="McVay 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McVay|first=J.|author2=Kane, M.|title=Conducting the train of thought: Working memory capacity, goal neglect, and mind wandering in an executive-control task|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=2009|volume=35|issue=1|pages=196–204|doi=10.1037/a0014104|pmid=19210090|pmc=2750806}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson-Riegler|first=Bridget|title=Cognitive psychology: Applying the science of the mind|date=2011|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-0-205-05006-2|pages=130–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Visual Attentional Control}} Visual attentional control==
Our brains have distinct [[attention]] systems that have been shaped throughout time by evolution. Visual [[attention]] operates mainly on three different representations: location&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Siegel M, Donner TH, Oostenveld R, Fries P, Engel AK |title=Neuronal synchronization along the dorsal visual pathway reflects the focus of spatial attention |journal=[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]] |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=709–719 |date=Mar 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2008.09.010 |pmid=19038226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When directing attention to a feature like motion, neuronal activity increases in areas specific for the feature. When visually searching for a non-spatial feature or a perceptual feature, selectively enhancing the sensitivity to that specific feature plays a role in directing attention.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=J.|author2=Chelazzi, L.|title=Attentional modulation of visual processing|journal=Annu.

According to [[fMRI]] studies of the brain and behavioral observations, visual attention can be moved independently of moving eye position. Studies have had participants fixate their eyes on a central point and measured brain activity as stimuli were presented outside the visual [[Fixation (visual)|fixation]] point. [[fMRI]] findings show changes in brain activity correlated with the shift in spatial attention to the various stimuli. Behavioral studies have also shown that when a person knows where a stimulus is likely to appear, their attention can shift to it more rapidly and process it better.&lt;ref name="Bear"&gt;Bear, Connors, Paradiso, Mark, Barry, Michael (2007). Neuroscience Exploring the Brain. Baltimore, MD: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. {{ISBN|9780781760034}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have demonstrated that perceptual and [[cognitive load]] affect spatial focusing of [[attention]].  These two mechanisms interact oppositely so that when cognitive load is decreased, perceptual load must be high to increase spatial attention focusing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linnell|first=Karina J.|author2=Serge Caparos|title=Perceptual and Cognitive Load interact to Control the Spatial Focus of Attention|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|date=18 July 2011|volume=37|series=5|pages=1643–1648|pmid=21767051|issue=5|doi=10.1037/a0024669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditory alertness==
The [[cocktail party effect]] is the phenomenon that a person hears his or her name even when not attending to the conversation. To study this, a screening measure for attentional control was given that tested a person’s ability to keep track of words while also doing math problems. Participants were separated into two groups---low and high span attentional control ability groups. They listened to two word lists read simultaneously by a male and a female voice and were told to ignore the male voice. Their name was read by the “ignored” male voice. Low span people were more likely to hear their name compared to high span people. This result suggests that people with lower attentional control ability have more trouble inhibiting information from the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name="Conway 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conway|first=A.|author2=Cowan, N. |author3=Bunting, M. |title=The cocktail party phenomenon revisited: The importance of WM capacity|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date=2001|volume=8|pages=331–335|doi=10.3758/bf03196169|pmid=11495122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''axis mundi''' (also '''cosmic axis''', '''world axis''', '''world pillar''', '''center of the world''', '''world tree'''), in certain beliefs and philosophies, is the world center, or the connection between [[Heaven]] and [[Earth]]. As the [[celestial pole]] and [[geographic pole]], it expresses a point of connection between sky and earth where the four compass directions meet. At this point travel and correspondence is made between higher and lower realms.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.48-51&lt;/ref&gt; Communication from lower realms may ascend to higher ones and blessings from higher realms may descend to lower ones and be disseminated to all.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr.

The image relates to the center of the earth (perhaps like an [[umbilical cord|umbilical]] providing nourishment){{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}. It may have the form of a natural object (a [[mountain]], a [[tree]], a [[vine]], a [[Plant stem|stalk]], a column of [[smoke]] or [[fire]]) or a product of human manufacture (a staff, a [[tower]], a [[ladder]], a [[staircase]], a [[maypole]], a [[cross]], a [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]], a [[rope]], a [[totem pole]], a [[Column|pillar]], a [[spire]]). Its proximity to heaven may carry implications that are chiefly religious ([[pagoda]], [[temple mount]], [[minaret]], [[church (building)|church]]) or secular ([[obelisk]], [[lighthouse]], [[rocket]], [[skyscraper]]). The image appears in religious and secular contexts.&lt;ref name="Alain Gheerbrandt 1982. pp.61-63"&gt;[[Jean Chevalier (writer)|Jean Chevalier]] and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.61-63, 173-175&lt;/ref&gt; The ''axis mundi'' symbol may be found in cultures utilizing [[shamanism|shamanic]] practices or [[animism|animist]] belief systems, in major world religions, and in technologically advanced "urban centers". In [[Mircea Eliade]]'s opinion, "Every Microcosm, every inhabited region, has a Centre; that is to say, a place that is sacred above all."&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1991. p.39"&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.39&lt;/ref&gt; The axis mundi is often associated with [[mandalas]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Background==
[[File:FujiSunriseKawaguchiko2025WP.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mount Fuji]], [[Japan]]]]
The symbol originates in a natural and universal psychological perception: that the spot one occupies stands at "the center of the world". This space serves as a microcosm of order because it is known and settled. Outside the boundaries of the microcosm lie foreign realms that, because they are unfamiliar or not ordered, represent chaos, death or night.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.37-39&lt;/ref&gt; From the center one may still venture in any of the four cardinal directions, make discoveries, and establish new centers as new realms become known and settled. The name of [[China]], meaning "Middle Nation" ({{lang|zh|中国}} [[pinyin]]: ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|Zhōngguó}}''), is often interpreted as an expression of an ancient perception that the Chinese polity (or group of polities) occupied the center of the world, with other lands lying in various directions relative to it.&lt;ref name="Alain Gheerbrandt 1982. pp.61-63"/&gt;

Within the central known universe a specific locale-often a mountain or other elevated place, a spot where earth and sky come closest gains status as center of the center, the '''axis mundi'''. High mountains are typically regarded as sacred by peoples living near them. Shrines are often erected at the summit or base.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.41-43&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Mount Kunlun]] fills a similar role in China.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Chong. ''Lunheng Part I: Philosophical Essays of Wang Ch'ung''. Trans. Alfred Forke. London: Luzac &amp; Co., 1907. p.337.&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Hebrews [[Mount Zion]] expressed the symbol.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Sioux]] beliefs take the [[Black Hills]] as the axis mundi.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Mount Kailash]] is holy to [[Hinduism]] and several religions in [[Tibet]]. The [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]] people in central Australia consider [[Uluru]] to be central to both their world and culture. In ancient [[Mesopotamia]] the cultures of ancient [[Sumer]] and [[Babylon]] erected artificial mountains, or [[ziggurat]]s, on the flat river plain. These supported staircases leading to temples at the top. The Hindu temples in India are often situated on high mountains. E.g. [[Amarnath Temple|Amarnath]], [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple|Tirupati]], [[Vaishno Devi]] etc. The pre-Columbian residents of [[Teotihuacán]] in [[Mexico]] erected huge [[pyramid]]s featuring staircases leading to heaven. These [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] temples were often placed on top of caves or subterranean springs, which were thought to be openings to the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art of Colonial Latin America|last=Bailey|first=Gauvin Alexander|publisher=Phaidon Press Limited|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York (NY)|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob's Ladder]] is an axis mundi image, as is the [[Temple Mount]]. For Christians the [[Cross]] on Mount [[Calvary]] expresses the symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.680-685&lt;/ref&gt; The Middle Kingdom, China, had a central mountain, [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun]], known in [[Taoism|Taoist literature]] as "the mountain at the middle of the world." To "go into the mountains" meant to dedicate oneself to a spiritual life.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.681&lt;/ref&gt; Monasteries of all faiths tend, like shrines, to be placed at elevated spots. Wise religious teachers are typically depicted in literature and art as bringing their revelations at world centers: mountains, trees, temples.

Because the axis mundi is an idea that unites a number of concrete images, no contradiction exists in regarding multiple spots as "the center of the world". The symbol can operate in a number of locales at once.&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1991. p.39"/&gt; [[Mount Hermon]] was regarded as the axis mundi in [[Caananite]] tradition, from where the sons of God are introduced descending in [[1 Enoch]] (1En6:6).&lt;ref name="Bautch2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kelley Coblentz Bautch|title=A Study of the Geography of 1 Enoch 17-19: "no One Has Seen what I Have Seen"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FPNFEtWNrQC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=28 June 2011|date=25 September 2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-13103-3|pages=62–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Urartu|ancient Armenians]] had a number of holy sites, the most important of which was [[Mount Ararat]], which was thought to be the home of the gods as well as the center of the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peopleofar.com/2013/08/11/noahs-ark-in-the-mountains-of-armenia/&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] regarded several sites as places of earth's ''[[omphalos]]'' (navel) stone, notably the oracle at [[Delphi]], while still maintaining a belief in a cosmic [[world tree]] and in [[Mount Olympus]] as the abode of the gods. Judaism has the [[Temple Mount]], Christianity has the [[Mount of Olives]] and [[Calvary]], Islam has [[Ka'aba]], said to be the first building on earth, and the [[Temple Mount]] ([[Dome of the Rock]]).  In [[Hinduism]], [[Mount Kailash]] is identified with the mythical [[Mount Meru]] and regarded as the home of [[Shiva]]; in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], Mount Kailash is recognized as the most sacred place where all the [[Ley line|dragon currents]] converge and is regarded as the gateway to [[Shambhala]].  In [[Shinto]], the [[Ise Shrine]] is the omphalos.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}  In addition to the [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun Mountains]], where it is believed the [[peach tree of immortality]] is located, the [[Chinese folk religion]] recognizes four other specific mountains as pillars of the world.

Sacred places constitute world centers ([[omphalos]]) with the [[altar]] or place of prayer as the axis. Altars, incense sticks, candles and torches form the axis by sending a column of smoke, and prayer, toward heaven. The architecture of sacred places often reflects this role. "Every temple or palace--and by extension, every sacred city or royal residence--is a Sacred Mountain, thus becoming a Centre."&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1971. p.12"&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Willard Trask). 'Archetypes and Repetition' in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return. Princeton, 1971. {{ISBN|0691017778}}. p.12&lt;/ref&gt; The [[stupa]] of [[Hinduism]], and later [[Buddhism]], reflects [[Mount Meru]]. Cathedrals are laid out in the form of a [[cross]], with the vertical bar representing the union of earth and heaven as the horizontal bars represent union of people to one another, with the altar at the intersection. [[Pagoda]] structures in Asian temples take the form of a stairway linking earth and heaven. A [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]] in a church or a [[minaret]] in a mosque also serve as connections of earth and heaven. Structures such as the [[maypole]], derived from the [[Saxons]]' [[Irminsul]], and the [[totem pole]] among [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] also represent world axes. The [[calumet (pipe)|calumet]], or sacred pipe, represents a column of smoke (the soul) rising form a world center.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.'' Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.148-149&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mandala]] creates a world center within the boundaries of its two-dimensional space analogous to that created in three-dimensional space by a shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.52-54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Yggdrasil]], the World Ash in Norse myths]]

===Plants===
Plants often serve as images of the axis mundi. The image of the [[Cosmic Tree]] provides an axis symbol that unites three planes: sky (branches), earth (trunk) and underworld (roots).&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.42-45&lt;/ref&gt; In some [[Pacific island]] cultures the [[banyan]] tree, of which the [[Bodhi tree]] is of the [[Sacred Fig]] variety, is the abode of ancestor spirits. In Hindu religion, the banyan tree is considered sacred and is called ''ashwath vriksha'' ("I am banyan tree among trees" - ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''). It represents eternal life because of its seemingly ever-expanding branches.  The Bodhi tree is also the name given to the tree under which [[Gautama Siddhartha]], the historical [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], sat on the night he attained [[Bodhi|enlightenment]]. The [[Yggdrasil]], or World Ash, functions in much the same way in [[Norse mythology]]; it is the site where [[Odin]] found enlightenment. Other examples include [[Jievaras]] in [[Lithuanian mythology]] and [[Thor's Oak]] in the myths of the pre-Christian [[Germanic peoples]]. The [[Tree of Life]] and the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] present two aspects of the same image. Each is said to stand at the center of the [[Garden of Eden|Paradise garden]] from which four rivers flow to nourish the whole world. Each tree confers a boon. [[Bamboo]], the plant from which Asian calligraphy pens are made, represents knowledge and is regularly found on Asian college campuses. The [[Christmas tree]], which can be traced in its origins back to pre-Christian [[Europe]]an beliefs, represents an axis mundi.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Chevalier, Jean and Gheerbrandt, Alain.

Penguin Books: London, 1996. {{ISBN|0140512543}}. pp.1025-1033&lt;/ref&gt; {{clarify span|[[Entheogen]]s (psychoactive substances) are often{{who|date=November 2012}} regarded as world axes|date=November 2012}}, such as the [[Fly Agaric]] mushroom among the [[Evenks]] of [[Russia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In China, traditional cosmography sometimes depicts the world center marked with the Jian tree ({{lang|zh|建木}}). Two more trees are placed at the East and West, corresponding to the points of sunrise and sunset, as described in the ''[[Huainanzi]]''. The [[Mesoamerican world tree]] connects the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Mary  |authorlink=Mary Miller (art historian) |author2=[[Karl Taube]]  |year=1993 |title=The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=186|isbn=0500050686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human figure===
The human body can express the symbol of world axis.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Symbolism of the Centre' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more abstract Tree of Life representations, such as the ''[[sefirot]]'' in [[Kabbalism]] and in the ''[[chakra]]'' system recognized by Hinduism and Buddhism, merge with the concept of the human body as a pillar between heaven and earth. Disciplines such as [[yoga]] and [[tai chi]] begin from the premise of the human body as axis mundi. The Buddha represents a world centre in human form.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade (tr. Philip Mairet). 'Indian Symbolisms of Time and Eternity' in ''Images and Symbols. Princeton, 1991. {{ISBN|069102068X}}. p.76&lt;/ref&gt; Large statues of a meditating figure unite the human figure with the symbolism of temple and tower. [[Astrology]] in all its forms assumes a connection between human health and affairs and the orientation of these with celestial bodies. World religions regard the body itself as a temple and prayer as a column uniting earth to heaven. The ancient [[Colossus of Rhodes]] combined the role of human figure with those of portal and skyscraper. The image of a human being suspended on a tree or a cross locates the figure at the axis where heaven and earth meet. The Renaissance image known as the [[Vitruvian Man]] represented a symbolic and mathematical exploration of the human form as world axis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Homes===
Homes can represent world centers. The symbolism for their residents is the same as for inhabitants of palaces and other sacred mountains.&lt;ref name="Mircea Eliade 1971. p.12"/&gt; The hearth participates in the symbolism of the [[altar]] and a central [[garden]] participates in the symbolism of primordial [[Garden of Eden|paradise]]. In Asian cultures houses were traditionally laid out in the form of a square oriented toward the four compass directions. A traditional Asian home was oriented toward the sky through [[feng shui]], a system of [[geomancy]], just as a palace would be. Traditional Arab houses are also laid out as a square surrounding a central fountain that evokes a primordial garden paradise. Mircea Eliade noted that "the symbolism of the pillar in [European] peasant houses likewise derives from the 'symbolic field' of the ''axis mundi''. In many archaic dwellings the central pillar does in fact serve as a means of communication with the heavens, with the sky."&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade. 'Brâncuși and Mythology' in ''Symbolism, the Sacred, and the Arts. Continuum, 1992. {{ISBN|0826406181}}. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;  The nomadic peoples of Mongolia and the Americas more often lived in circular structures.

===Shamanic function===
A common [[shamanism|shamanic]] concept, and a universally told story, is that of the healer traversing the axis mundi to bring back knowledge from the other world. It may be seen in the stories from [[Odin]] and the [[Yggdrasil|World Ash Tree]] to [[the Garden of Eden]] and [[Jacob's Ladder]] to [[Jack and the Beanstalk]] and [[Rapunzel]]. It is the essence of the journey described in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri]]. The epic poem relates its hero's descent and ascent through a series of spiral structures that take him from through the core of the earth, from the depths of Hell to celestial Paradise.
It is also a central tenet in the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |  last = Townsend | first = Richard F. |  title = [[Hero, Hawk, and Open Hand]]| publisher = [[Yale University Press]] | year = 2004 |  isbn = 0-300-10601-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone or anything suspended on the axis between heaven and earth becomes a repository of potential knowledge. A special status accrues to the thing suspended: a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], a victim of crucifixion or hanging, a rod, a fruit, [[mistletoe]]. Derivations of this idea find form in the [[Rod of Asclepius]], an emblem of the medical profession, and in the [[caduceus]], an emblem of correspondence and commercial professions. The staff in these emblems represents the axis mundi while the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]] act as guardians of, or guides to, knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt.

{{Synthesis|date=November 2008}}
Axis mundi symbolism continues to be evoked, even in modern societies, through various art forms and has a deep rooted spiritual inspiration that transcends time.

The idea has proven consequential in the realm of [[architecture]].  Structures that have a spiritual meaning, that inspire and create a connection between the spiritual world and the physical world, that are erected as monuments to commemorate are achievements can be considered to be inspired by the axis mundi. The pyramids that have been erected throughout human history serve as perfect examples of axis mundi.  A [[skyscraper]], as the term itself suggests, suggests the connection of earth and sky, as do [[spire]] structures of all sorts. Such buildings come to be regarded as "centers" of an inhabited area, or even the world, and serve as icons of its ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Dupré. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog &amp; Leventhal, 1998/2008. p.137&lt;/ref&gt; The first skyscraper of modern times, the [[Eiffel Tower]], exemplifies this role. The structure was erected in 1889 in [[Paris]], [[France]], to serve as the centerpiece for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]], making it a symbolic world center from the planning stages. It has served as an iconic image for the city and the nation ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Dupré. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog &amp; Leventhal, 1998/2008. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Landmark skyscrapers often take names that clearly identify them as centers.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Dupré. 'Skyscrapers: A History of the World's Most Extraordinary Buildings.' Black Dog &amp; Leventhal, 1998/2008. pp. 45, 69, 81, 91, 97,135, 136, 143&lt;/ref&gt; 

Artistic representations of the axis mundi are plentiful. Just one example of these is the ''Colonne sans fin'' (''[[The Endless Column]]'', 1938) an abstract [[sculpture]] by Romanian [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. The column takes the form of a "sky pillar" ({{lang|ro|{{vanchor|columna cerului}}}}) upholding the heavens even as its rhythmically repeating segments invite climb and suggest the possibility of ascension.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade. 'Brâncuși and Mythology' in ''Symbolism, the Sacred, and the Arts. Continuum, 1992. {{ISBN|0826406181}}. p.99-100&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual representation of the axis mundi in contemporary art is currently being achieved by photographer Jennifer Westjohn.  By the process of mirror symmetry of a single photograph the artist exposes an entirely new image: the 5th point.  The viewer is then introduced to a coalescing of nature and the universe which lends new perspective to the original image.  This artistic representation of axis mundi opens the mind up to a new visual dimension both energistic and shamanic.&lt;ref&gt; Jennifer Westjohn. Photographer. "jenniferwestjohn.com" "the5thpoint.com" 2013-2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Axis mundi symbolism exists in modern [[Spaceflight|space travel]]. &lt;ref&gt;Jean Chevalier and Alain Gheerbrandt. ''A Dictionary of Symbols.''

The [[Apollo 13]] insignia stated it succinctly: ''Ex luna scientia'' ("From the Moon, knowledge").&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/history/apollo/apollo-13/apollo-13.html Nasa Apollo Mission: Apollo 13. 2007-08-25]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13521">The '''biophilia hypothesis''' also called BET suggests that humans possess an innate tendency to seek connections with [[nature]] and other forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;"biophilia hypothesis." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]]  introduced and popularized the hypothesis in his book, ''Biophilia'' (1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Edward O.|title=Biophilia|year=1984|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]|isbn=0-674-07442-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He defines biophilia as "the urge to affiliate with other forms of life".&lt;ref&gt;Kellert &amp; Wilson 1995, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Love of living systems ==
The term "biophilia" means "love of life or living systems." It was first used by [[Erich Fromm]] to describe a [[Erich Fromm|psychological orientation]] of being attracted to all that is alive and vital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fromm|first=Erich|title=The Heart of Man|year=1964|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson uses the term in the same sense when he suggests that biophilia describes "the connections that human beings subconsciously seek with the rest of life." He proposed the possibility that the deep affiliations humans have with other life forms and nature as a whole are rooted in our biology. Unlike [[phobia]]s, which are the aversions and fears that people have of things in their environment, [[philia]]s are the attractions and positive feelings that people have toward organisms, species, habitats, processes and objects in their natural surroundings. 
Although named by Fromm, the concept of biophilia has been proposed and defined many times over. Aristotle was one of many to put forward a concept that could be summarized as "love of life". Diving into the term ''philia'', or friendship, Aristotle evokes the idea of reciprocity and how friendships are beneficial to both parties in more than just one way, but especially in the way of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;SANTAS, ARISTOTELIS. "Aristotelian Ethics And Biophilia." Ethics &amp; The Environment 19.1 (2014): 95-121. GreenFILE. Web. 24 Feb. 2015 http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=2ed69cd6-0f3e-47aa-b03a-a284b3619652%40sessionmgr113&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=116&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Children and Nature: Psychological, Sociocultural, and Evolutionary Investigations'' edited by Peter Kahn and Stephen Kellert,&lt;ref name="childrennature"&gt;{{cite book|title=Children and nature: psychological, sociocultural, and evolutionary investigations|first=Peter |last=Kahn|first2=Stephen |last2=Kellert|year=2002 |publisher=[[MIT Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCjdKjI_qIcC&amp;pg=PA153|isbn=0-262-11267-1 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; the importance of animals, especially those with which a child can develop a nurturing relationship, is emphasized particularly for early and middle childhood. Chapter 7 of the same book reports on the help that animals can provide to children with autistic-spectrum disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Animals in Therapeutic Education: Guides into the Liminal State|first=Aaron|last=Katcher|title=Children and Nature: Psychological, Sociocultural, and Evolutionary Investigations|year=2002|editor1-last=Kahn|editor1-first=Peter H.|editor2-last=Kellert|editor2-first=Stephen R|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCjdKjI_qIcC&amp;pg=PA179|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-11267-1|accessdate=January 30, 2013|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product of biological evolution ==
Human preferences toward things in [[nature]], while refined through experience and culture, are hypothetically the product of biological evolution. For example, adult mammals (especially humans) are generally attracted to baby mammal faces and find them [[Cuteness|appealing]] across species. The large eyes and small features of any young mammal face are far more appealing than those of the mature adults.

Similarly, the hypothesis helps explain why ordinary people care for and sometimes risk their lives to save domestic and wild animals, and keep plants and flowers in and around their homes. In other words, our natural love for life helps sustain life.

Very often, flowers also indicate potential for food later. Most fruits start their development as flowers. For our ancestors, it was crucial to spot, detect and remember the plants that would later provide nutrition.

==Biophilia and conservation==
Because of our technological advancements and more time spent inside buildings and cars, it is argued that the lack of biophilic activities and time spent in nature may be strengthening the disconnect of humans from nature. Although, it also has shown strong urges among people to reconnect with nature. 
The concern for a lack of connection with the rest of nature outside of us, is that a stronger disregard for other plants, animals and less appealing wild areas could lead to further ecosystem degradation and species loss. Therefore, reestablishing a connection with nature has become more important in the field of conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rogers|first1=Kara|title=Biophilia Hypothesis|url=http://www.britannica.com/science/biophilia-hypothesis|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |accessdate=10 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2016}} Examples would be more available green spaces in and around cities, more classes that revolve around nature and implementing smart design for greener cities that integrate ecosystems into them such as biophilic cities. These cities can also become part of wildlife corridors to help with migrational and territorial needs of other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biophilic Cities | url=http://biophiliccities.org|website=Biophilic Cities|accessdate=10 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The hypothesis has since been developed as part of theories of [[evolutionary psychology]] in the book ''The Biophilia Hypothesis'' edited by Stephen R. Kellert and Edward O. Wilson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kellert|first=Stephen R. (ed.)|title=The Biophilia Hypothesis|publisher=[[Island Press]]|year=1993|isbn=1-55963-147-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Lynn Margulis]].  Also, Stephen Kellert's work seeks to determine common human responses to perceptions of, and ideas about, plants and animals, and to explain them in terms of the conditions of human evolution.

==Biophilic design==
In [[architecture]], biophilic design is a [[sustainable design]] strategy that incorporates reconnecting people with the natural environment. It may be seen as a necessary complement to [[Sustainable architecture|green architecture]], which decreases the environmental impact of the built world but does not address human reconnection with the natural world.&lt;ref name="kellert-film"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stephenrkellert.net/biophilic-design.html | title=Biophilic Design: The Architecture of Life | work=www.stephenrkellert.net | accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gangemi Editore  [http://www.gangemieditore.com/dettaglio/partecipazione-ict/4248/2] {{ISBN|9788849225365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biophilic architecture is characterized by the following elements: i) the naturalistic dimension; (ii) the Wholeness &lt;ref&gt;C.

Having a window looking out to plants is also claimed to help speed up the healing process of patients in hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nature-that-nurtures/ Windows looking out to plants helping the healing process]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, having plants in the same room as patients in hospitals also speeds up their healing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=19715461 | doi=10.1089/acm.2009.0075 | volume=15 | title=Ornamental indoor plants in hospital rooms enhanced health outcomes of patients recovering from surgery | year=2009 | journal=J Altern Complement Med | pages=975–80 | last1 = Park | first1 = SH | last2 = Mattson | first2 = RH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biophilia in fiction==
Canadian author [[Hilary Cunningham Scharper|Hilary Scharper]] explicitly adapted [[E. O. Wilson|E.O. Wilson]]'s  concept of biophilia for her ecogothic novel, ''Perdita''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Arousing Biophilia|url = http://arts.envirolink.org/interviews_and_conversations/EOWilson.html|website = arts.envirolink.org|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel, Perdita (meaning "the lost one") is a [[mythology|mythological figure]] who brings biophilia to humanity.

'''Common sense''' is sound practical judgment concerning everyday matters, or a basic ability to [[Perception|perceive]], [[Nous|understand]], and [[Phronesis|judge]] that is shared by ("common to") nearly all people.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' gives: "sound and prudent judgment based on a simple perception of the situation or facts." [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/common+sense], Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary. The [[Cambridge Dictionary]] defines it as, "the basic level of practical knowledge and judgment that we all need to help us live in a reasonable and safe way."[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/common-sense], Cambridge Dictionaries Online. {{harvtxt|van Holthoorn|Olson|1987|page=9}} say that "common sense consists of knowledge, judgement, and taste which is more or less universal and which is held more or less without reflection or argument." C.S. {{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}} wrote that what common sense "often means" is "the elementary mental outfit of the normal man."&lt;/ref&gt; The first type of common sense, good sense, can be described as "the knack for seeing things as they are, and doing things as they ought to be done." The second type is sometimes described as [[folk wisdom]], "signifying unreflective knowledge not reliant on specialized training or deliberative thought." The two types are intertwined, as the person who has common sense is in touch with common-sense ideas, which emerge from the lived experiences of those commonsensical enough to perceive them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Emotional Common Sense as Constitutional Law|volume=62|pages=851|date=2009|journal=Vanderbilt Law Review|author=Maroney, Terry A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a psychology context, Smedslund defines common sense as "the system of implications shared by the competent users of a language" and notes, "A proposition in a given context belongs to common sense if and only if all competent users of the language involved agree that the proposition in the given context is true and that its negation is false."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smedslund, Jan|title=Common sense as psychosocial reality: A reply to Sjöberg|journal=Scandinavian journal of psychology|date=September 1982|volume=23|issue=1|pages=79-82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The everyday understanding of common sense derives from historical philosophical discussion involving several European languages. Related terms in other languages include Latin '''{{lang|la|sensus communis}}''', Greek {{lang|grc|αἴσθησις κοινὴ}} ('''{{transl|grc|aísthēsis koinḕ}}'''), and French '''{{lang|fr|bon sens}}''', but these are not straightforward translations in all contexts. Similarly in English, there are different shades of meaning, implying more or less education and wisdom: "good sense" is sometimes seen as equivalent to "common sense", and sometimes not.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Thomas Reid]] contrasted common sense and good sense to some extent. See {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010|page=340}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|right|Aristotle, the first person known to have discussed "common sense", described it as the ability with which animals (including humans) process sense-perceptions, memories and imagination ({{lang|grc|φρονεῖν}}, {{transl|grc|phroneîn}}) in order to reach many types of basic judgments. In his scheme, only humans have real reasoned thinking ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:νοεῖν#Ancient Greek|νοεῖν]]}}, {{transl|grc|noeîn}}), which takes them beyond their common sense.]]
"Common sense" also has at least two specifically philosophical meanings. One is a capability of the animal soul ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ψυχή#Ancient Greek|ψῡχή]]}}, {{transl|grc|psūkhḗ}}) proposed by [[Aristotle]], which enables different individual senses to collectively perceive the characteristics of physical things such as movement and size, which all physical things have in different combinations, allowing people and other animals to distinguish and identify physical things. This common sense is distinct from basic sensory perception and from human rational thinking, but cooperates with both.

The second special use of the term is Roman-influenced and is used for the natural human sensitivity for other humans and the community.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'' of 1973 gives 4 meanings of "common sense": (1) An archaic meaning is "An internal sense which was regarded as the common bond or centre of the five senses"; (2) "Ordinary, normal, or average understanding" without which a man would be "foolish or insane" (3) "The general sense of mankind, or of a community" (two sub-meanings of this are good sound practical sense and general sagacity) (4) A philosophical meaning, the "faculty of primary truths".&lt;/ref&gt; Just like the everyday meaning, both of these refer to a type of basic awareness and ability to judge that most people are expected to share naturally, even if they cannot explain why.

All these meanings of "common sense", including the everyday ones, are interconnected in a complex history and have evolved during important political and philosophical debates in modern [[Western civilisation]], notably concerning [[science]], politics and [[economics]].&lt;ref&gt;See the body of this article concerning (for example) Descartes, Hobbes, Adam Smith, and so on. [[Thomas Paine]]'s pamphlet named ''"[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]"'' was an influential publishing success during the period leading up to the [[American revolution]].&lt;/ref&gt; The interplay between the meanings has come to be particularly notable in English, as opposed to other western European languages, and the English term has become international.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{Harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011|page=282}}; {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010}}; and {{harvtxt|van Kessel|1987|page=117}}: "today the Anglo-Saxon concept prevails almost everywhere".&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Age of Enlightenment]] the term "common sense" has frequently been used for [[rhetoric]]al effect, sometimes pejorative, and sometimes appealed to positively, [[Argument from authority|as an authority]]. It can be negatively equated to [[wikt:vulgar|vulgar]] [[prejudice]] and [[superstition]], or on the contrary it is often positively contrasted to them as a standard for [[good taste]] and as the source of the most basic [[axiom]]s needed for science and logic.&lt;ref name="hund"&gt;{{harvtxt|Hundert|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the beginning of the eighteenth century that this old philosophical term first acquired its modern English meaning: "Those plain, self-evident truths or conventional wisdom that one needed no sophistication to grasp and no proof to  accept  precisely  because  they  accorded  so  well  with  the  basic  (common sense) intellectual capacities and experiences of the whole social body" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Sophia|title=Common sense : a political history.|date=2014|publisher=Harvard Univ Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=9780674284166|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This began with [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' criticism of it, and what came to be known as the dispute between "[[rationalism]]" and "[[empiricism]]". In the opening line of one of his most famous books, ''[[Discourse on Method]]'', Descartes established the most common modern meaning, and its controversies, when he stated that everyone has a similar and sufficient amount of common sense ({{lang|fr|bon sens}}), but it is rarely used well. Therefore, a skeptical logical method described by Descartes needs to be followed and common sense should not be overly relied upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Part I of the ''Discourse on Method''. NOTE: The term in French is "{{lang|fr|bon sens}}" sometimes translated as "good sense". The opening lines in English translation read: {{Quote|"Good Sense is, of all things among men, the most equally distributed; for every one thinks himself so abundantly provided with it, that those even who are the most difficult to satisfy in everything else, do not usually desire a larger measure of this quality than they already possess. And in this it is not likely that all are mistaken: the conviction is rather to be held as testifying that the power of judging aright and of distinguishing [[Truth]] from [[Error]], which is properly what is called [[Good Sense]] or [[Reason]], is by nature equal in all men; and that the diversity of our opinions, consequently, does not arise from some being endowed with a larger share of Reason than others, but solely from this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways, and do not fix our attention on the same objects. For to be possessed of a vigorous mind is not enough; the prime requisite is rightly to apply it. The greatest minds, as they are capable of the highest excellencies, are open likewise to the greatest aberrations; and those who travel very slowly may yet make far greater progress, provided they keep always to the straight road, than those who, while they run, forsake it."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing 18th century [[Enlightenment era|Enlightenment]], common sense came to be seen more positively as the basis for modern thinking. It was contrasted to [[metaphysics]], which was, like [[Cartesianism]], associated with the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien Régime]]}}. [[Thomas Paine]]'s polemical pamphlet ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' (1776) has been described as the most influential political pamphlet of the 18th century, affecting both the [[American revolution|American]] and [[French revolution]]s.&lt;ref name="hund" /&gt; Today, the concept of common sense, and how it should best be used, remains linked to many of the most perennial topics in [[epistemology]] and [[ethics]], with special focus often directed at the philosophy of the modern [[social sciences]].

==Aristotelian==
The origin of the term is in the works of [[Aristotle]]. The best-known case is ''[[De Anima]]'' [http://www.mikrosapoplous.gr/aristotle/psyxhs/3_01.html Book III, chapter 1], especially at line 425a27.&lt;ref&gt;There are other places in the works of Aristotle uses the same two words together: ''[[De memoria et reminiscentia]]'' 1450a, ''[[De Partibus Animalium]]'' IV.10 686a, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' I.1 981b, ''[[Historia Animalium]]'' I.3 489a. See {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage is about how the animal mind converts raw sense perceptions from the [[Five wits|five specialized]] [[sense perception]]s, into perceptions of real things moving and changing, which can be thought about. According to Aristotle's understanding of perception, each of the five senses perceives one type of "perceptible" or "sensible" which is specific ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἴδιος#Ancient Greek|ἴδια]]}}, {{transl|grc|idia}}) to it. For example, sight can see colour. But Aristotle was explaining how the animal mind, not just the human mind, links and categorizes different tastes, colours, feelings, smells and sounds in order to perceive real things in terms of the "common sensibles" (or "common perceptibles"). In this discussion, "common" ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:κοινός#Ancient Greek|κοινή]]}}, {{transl|grc|koiné}}) is a term opposed to specific or particular ({{transl|grc|idia}}). The Greek for these common sensibles is {{transl|grc|tá koiná}} ({{lang|grc|τά κοινᾰ́}}, {{literal translation|'that which is common to many'|lk=on}}), which means shared or common things, and examples include the oneness of each thing, with its specific shape and size and so on, and the change or movement of each thing.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle lists change, shape, magnitude, number and unity, but he notes that we perceive shape, magnitude, and the rest by first being able to perceive change or movement (Greek uses one word for both: {{lang|grc|[[wikt:κίνησις#Ancient Greek|κῑ́νησῐς]]}}, {{transl|grc|kī́nēsis}}), and number is perceived by perceiving a lack of unity. (''De Anima'' 425a16, just before the famous mention of "common sense".) As {{harvtxt|Lee|2011}} explains, Aristotle is talking about what [[Robert Boyle]] and [[John Locke]] referred to as "[[primary qualities]]" (not to be confused with Aristotle's use of the term "primary qualities"). Plato is not so clear. In the equivalent passage in Plato's ''Theaetetus'' 185c–d, he talks about what is common in all things, and in specific things, and by which we say that things for example "are" versus "are not"; are "similar" versus "dissimilar"; are the "same" versus being "different"; being one or a higher number; odd or even.&lt;/ref&gt; Distinct combinations of these properties are common to all perceived things.&lt;ref&gt;These "common sensibles" or {{transl|grc|koiná}} are in other words one Platonic-Aristotelian version of what are today called "[[universals]]", although it should be noted that Aristotle distinguishes the {{transl|grc|koiná}} perceived by common sense, from the [[Theory of forms|forms]] or ideas seen by the {{transl|grc|[[Nous|noûs]]}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:νοῦς#Ancient Greek|νοῦς]]}}). See for example {{citation|title=A Companion to Aristotle
|editor-first= Georgios |editor-last=Anagnostopoulos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nlfBVrDmlgC&amp;pg=PT215|isbn= 9781118610633 |date= 2013-03-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this passage, Aristotle explained that concerning these {{transl|grc|koiná}} (such as movement) we already have a sense, a "common sense" or sense of the common things ({{transl|grc|aísthēsis koinḕ}}), which does not work by [[accident (philosophy)|accident]] ({{lang|grc|κᾰτᾰ́ σῠμβεβηκός}}, {{transl|grc|katá sumbebēkós}}). And there is no specific ({{transl|grc|idéā}}) sense perception for movement and other {{transl|grc|koiná}}, because then we would not perceive the {{transl|grc|koiná}} at all, except by accident. As examples of perceiving by accident Aristotle mentions using the specific sense perception vision on its own to see that something is sweet, or to recognize a friend by their distinctive color. {{harvtxt|Lee|2011|page=31}} explains that "when I see Socrates, it is not insofar as he is Socrates that he is visible to my eye, but rather because he is coloured". So the normal five individual senses do sense the common perceptibles according to Aristotle (and Plato), but it is not something they necessarily interpret correctly on their own. Aristotle proposes that the reason for having several senses is in fact that it increases the chances that we can distinguish and recognize things correctly, and not just occasionally or by accident.&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'' line 425a47, just after the famous mention of "common sense".&lt;/ref&gt; Each sense is used to identify distinctions, such as sight identifying the difference between black and white, but, says Aristotle, all animals with perception must have "some one thing" that can distinguish black from sweet.&lt;ref&gt;''De Anima'' column 427a. Plato, in his ''Theaetatus'' 185a–c uses the question of how to judge if sound or colour are salty.&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is where this comparison happens, and this must occur by comparing impressions (or symbols or markers; {{lang|grc|[[wikt:σημεῖον#Ancient Greek|σημεῖον]]}}, {{transl|grc|sēmeîon}}, {{literal translation|'sign, mark'|lk=on}}) of what the specialist senses have perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sachs|2011|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is therefore also where a type of [[consciousness]] originates, "for it makes us aware of having sensations at all". And it receives physical picture imprints from the imaginative faculty, which are then memories that can be recollected.&lt;ref name="brann43" /&gt;

The discussion was apparently intended to improve upon the account of Aristotle's friend and teacher [[Plato]] in his [[Socratic dialogue]], the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Approximately [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Theaet.+185a&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171 185a]–[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0171%3Atext%3DTheaet.%3Asection%3D187a 187a].&lt;/ref&gt; But Plato's dialogue presented an argument that recognizing {{transl|grc|koiná}} is an active thinking process in the rational part of the human soul, making the senses instruments of the thinking part of man. Plato's Socrates says this kind of thinking is not a kind of sense at all. Aristotle, trying to give a more general account of the souls of all animals, not just humans, moved the act of perception out of the rational thinking soul into this {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, which is something like a sense, and something like thinking, but not rational.&lt;ref name="greg"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Avicenna-miniatur.jpg|thumb|right|Avicenna became one of the greatest medieval authorities concerning Aristotelian common sense, both in Islamic and Christian lands.]]

The passage is difficult to interpret and there is little consensus about many of the details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007}}, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|pages=204–205}} has argued that this may be because Aristotle did not use the term as a standardized technical term at all. For example, in some passages in his works, Aristotle seems to use the term to refer to the individual sense perceptions simply being common to all people, or common to various types of animals. There is also difficulty with trying to determine whether the common sense is truly separable from the individual sense perceptions and from imagination, in anything other than a conceptual way as a capability. Aristotle never fully spells out the relationship between the common sense and the [[imagination|imaginative faculty]] ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φαντασία#Ancient Greek|φᾰντᾰσῐ́ᾱ]]}}, {{transl|grc|phantasíā}}), although the two clearly work together in animals, and not only humans, for example in order to enable a perception of time. They may even be the same.&lt;ref name="brann43"&gt;{{harvtxt|Brann|1991|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greg" /&gt; Despite hints by Aristotle himself that they were united, early commentators such as [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] and [[Al-Farabi]] felt they were distinct, but later, [[Avicenna]] emphasized the link, influencing future authors including Christian philosophers.&lt;ref name="hr42" /&gt;&lt;ref name="walz"&gt;{{citation|title=Al-Farabi on the Perfect State|first=Richard |last=Walzer| isbn=1871031761|year=1998|page=389}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=205}} argues that Aristotle used the term "common sense" both to discuss the individual senses when these act as a unity, which Gregorić calls "the perceptual capacity of the soul", or the higher level "sensory capacity of the soul" that represents the senses and the imagination working as a unity. According to Gregorić, there appears to have been a standardization of the term {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}} as a term for the perceptual capacity (not the higher level sensory capacity), which occurred by the time of Alexander of Aphrodisias at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to Plato, Aristotle's understanding of the soul ({{transl|grc|psūkhḗ}}) has an extra level of complexity in the form of the {{transl|grc|[[Nous|noûs]]}} or "intellect"—which is something only humans have and enables humans to perceive things differently from other animals. It works with images coming from the common sense and imagination, using [[reason]]ing ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λόγος#Ancient Greek|λόγος]]}}, {{transl|grc|[[Logos|lógos]]}}) as well as the ''[[active intellect]]''. The {{transl|grc|noûs}} identifies the true [[Formal cause|forms of things]], while the common sense identifies shared aspects of things. Though scholars have varying interpretations of the details, Aristotle's "common sense" was in any case not rational, in the sense that it implied no ability to explain the perception. [[Reason]] or [[rationality]] ({{transl|grc|lógos}}) exists only in man according to Aristotle, and yet some animals can perceive "common perceptibles" such as change and shape, and some even have imagination according to Aristotle. Animals with imagination come closest to having something like reasoning and {{transl|grc|noûs}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' II.19.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato, on the other hand was apparently willing to allow that animals could have some level of thought, meaning that he did not have to explain their sometimes complex behavior with a strict division between high-level perception processing and the human-like thinking such as being able to form opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|pages=5–6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregorić additionally argues that Aristotle can be interpreted as using the verbs {{transl|grc|phroneîn}} and {{transl|grc|noeîn}} to distinguish two types of thinking or awareness, the first being found in animals and the second unique to humans and involving reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gregorić|2007}}, Part II, chapter 3, which concerns a passage in ''[[De Partibus Animalium]]'' IV, but also refers to other passages in the corpus. See footnote 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in Aristotle (and the medieval Aristotelians) the universals used to identify and categorize things are divided into two. In medieval terminology these are the {{lang|la|species sensibilis}} used for perception and imagination in animals, and the {{lang|la|species intelligibilis}} or apprehendable forms used in the human intellect or {{transl|grc|noûs}}.

Aristotle also occasionally called the {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}} (or one version of it) the {{transl|grc|prôton aisthētikón}} ({{lang|grc|πρῶτον αἰσθητῐκόν}}, {{literal translation|'first of the senses'|lk=no}}). (According to Gregorić, this is specifically in contexts where it refers to the higher order common sense that includes imagination.) Later philosophers developing this line of thought, such as [[Themistius]], [[Galen]], and [[Al-Farabi]], called it the {{em|ruler}} of the senses or {{em|ruling}} sense, apparently a metaphor developed from a section of Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (70b).&lt;ref name="walz" /&gt; [[Augustine]] and some of the Arab writers, also called it the "inner sense".&lt;ref name="hr42" /&gt; The concept of the inner senses, plural, was further developed in the [[Middle Ages]]. Under the influence of the great Persian philosophers [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]], several inner senses came to be listed. "Thomas Aquinas and [[John of Jandun]] recognized four internal senses: the common sense, [[imagination]], {{lang|la|vis cogitativa}}, and memory. Avicenna, followed by [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Albert the Great]], and [[Roger Bacon]], argued for five internal senses: the common sense, imagination, fantasy, {{lang|la|vis aestimativa}}, and memory."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=10}}. The "cogitative" or "estimative" capacity, {{lang|la|vis aestimativa}}, "enables the animal to extract vital information about its environment from the form processed by the common sense and imagination."&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of [[Descartes]] and [[Hobbes]], in the 1600s, the inner senses had been standardized to ''[[five wits]]'', which complemented the more well-known five "external" senses.&lt;ref name="hr42"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this medieval scheme the common sense was understood to be seated not in the heart, as Aristotle had thought, but in the anterior [[Galen]]ic [[Ventricular system|ventricle]] of the brain. The great anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius]] however found no connections between the anterior ventricle and the sensory nerves, leading to speculation about other parts of the brain into the 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=11}}. See below concerning Descartes.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008}} writes that "In different ways the philosophers of medieval Latin and Arabic tradition, from Al-Farabi to Avicenna, [[Averroës]], [[Albertus Magnus|Albert]], and [[Thomas of Aquinas|Thomas]], found in the ''De Anima'' and the ''[[Parva Naturalia]]'' the scattered elements of a coherent doctrine of the "central" faculty of the sensuous soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "one of the most successful and resilient of Aristotelian notions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gregorić|2007|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman==
[[File:Marcus Aurelius statue.01.JPG|right|thumb|Marcus Aurelius, emperor and Stoic philosopher, and an important influence upon the concept of "humanist" common sense.]]
"{{lang|la|Sensus communis}}" is the Latin translation of the Greek {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, which came to be recovered by Medieval [[scholastics]] when discussing Aristotelian theories of perception. However, in earlier Latin during the Roman empire the term had taken a distinct ethical detour, developing new shades of meaning. These especially Roman meanings were apparently influenced by several Stoic Greek terms with the word {{transl|grc|koinḗ}} ({{lang|grc|κοινή}}, {{literal translation|'common, shared'}}); not only {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, but also such terms as {{transl|grc|koinós noûs}} ({{lang|grc|κοινός νοῦς}}, {{literal translation|'common mind/thought/reason'|lk=no}}) {{transl|grc|koinḗ énnoia}} ({{lang|grc|κοινή ἔννοιᾰ}}), and {{transl|grc|koinonoēmosúnē}}, all of which involve {{transl|grc|noûs}}—something, at least in Aristotle, that would not be present in "lower" animals.&lt;ref name="Bugter1987"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{transl|grc|Koinḗ énnoia}} is a term from [[Stoic philosophy]], a Greek philosophy, influenced by Aristotle, and influential in [[Rome]]. This refers to shared notions, or common conceptions, that are either in-born or imprinted by the senses on to the soul. Unfortunately few true Stoic texts survive, and our understanding of their technical terminology is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Prolepsis and Ennoia in the Early Stoa|first= Henry |last=Dyson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1AXMNpIgJ4C| year=2009| publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn= 9783110212297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{transl|grc|Koinós noûs}} is a term found in [[Epictetus]] (III.vi.8), a Stoic philosopher. C.S. {{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}} believed this to be close to a modern English meaning of "common sense", "the elementary mental outfit of the normal man", something like [[intelligence]]. He noted that {{lang|la|sensus}} could be a translation of {{transl|grc|noûs}}, (for example in the [[Vulgate Bible]]), but he only found one clear case of a Latin text showing this apparent meaning, a text by [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus the fable writer]].
* {{transl|grc|Koinonoēmosúnē}} is found only in the work of the emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (''[[Meditations]]'' I.16), also known as a Stoic. (He uses the word on its own in a list of things he learned from his adopted father.) Shaftesbury and others felt it represented the Stoic Greek original, which gave the special Roman meaning of {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, especially when used to refer to someone's public spirit. Shaftesbury explained the change of meaning as being due to the specific way that Stoics understood perception and intellect, saying that one should "consider withal how small the distinction was in that Philosophy, between the {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὑπόληψις|ὑπόληψις]]}} [conjecture], and the vulgar {{lang|grc|[[wikt:αἴσθησις|αἴσθησις]]}} [perception]; how generally Passion was by those Philosophers brought under the Head of Opinion".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Shaftesbury|2001}}, volume I, part III, section I, first footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another link between Latin {{lang|la|communis sensus}} and Aristotle's Greek was in [[rhetoric]], a subject that Aristotle was the first to systematize. In rhetoric, a prudent speaker must take account of opinions ({{lang|grc|δόξαι}}, {{transl|grc|[[Doxa|dóxai]]}}) that are widely held.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] saw Aristotle's rhetorical work as having formed a continuity with his ethical and political work, all sharing a focus upon {{transl|grc|[[Phronesis|phrónēsis]]}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:φρόνησις#Ancient Greek|φρόνησῐς]]}}, {{literal translation|'practical wisdom'|lk=no}}), and a connection to what Vico saw in the concept of common sense. See {{citation|title=Gadamer's Hermeneutics and the Art of Conversation| editor-first=Andrzej |editor-last=Wierciński| first=John|last=Arthos| chapter=Gadamer's dialogical imperative: Linking Socratic dialogue to Aristotle's ''PHRONESIS''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lE268UbRQsC| isbn=9783643111722 | year=2011 }} and {{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle referred to such commonly held beliefs not as {{transl|grc|koinaí dóxai}} ({{lang|grc|κοιναί δόξαι}}, {{literal translation|'common opinions'|lk=no}}), which is a term he used for self-evident logical axioms, but with other terms such as {{transl|grc|[[Endoxa|éndóxa]]}} ({{lang|grc|ἔνδόξα}}).

In his ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' for example Aristotle mentions "{{transl|grc|koinōn&amp;nbsp;[...] tàs písteis}}" or "common beliefs", saying that "our proofs and arguments must rest on generally accepted principles, [...] when speaking of converse with the multitude".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|ἀνάγκη διὰ τῶν κοινῶν ποιεῖσθαι τὰς πίστεις καὶ τοὺς λόγους}} [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0059%3Abekker+page%3D1355a ''Rhetoric'' 1355a]&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar passage in his own work on rhetoric, ''[[De Oratore]]'', [[Cicero]] wrote that "in oratory the very cardinal sin is to depart from the language of everyday life and the usage approved by the sense of the community". The sense of the community is in this case one translation of "{{lang|la|communis sensus}}" in the Latin of Cicero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0120:book=1:section=12&amp;highlight=communis%2Csensus ''De Oratore'', I, 3, 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the Latin writers such as [[Cicero]] deliberately used this Aristotelian term in a new more peculiarly Roman way, probably also influenced by Greek Stoicism, therefore remains a subject of discussion. {{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=112}} has proposed for example that the [[Roman republic]] maintained a very "oral" culture whereas in Aristotle's time rhetoric had come under heavy criticism from philosophers such as Socrates. {{harvtxt|Peters Agnew|2008}} argues, in agreement with [[Shaftesbury]] in the 18th century, that the concept developed from the Stoic concept of ethical virtue, influenced by Aristotle, but emphasizing the role of both the individual perception, and shared communal understanding. But in any case a complex of ideas attached itself to the term, to be almost forgotten in the Middle Ages, and eventually returning into ethical discussion in 18th-century Europe, after Descartes.

As with other meanings of common sense, for the Romans of the classical era "it designates a sensibility shared by all, from which one may deduce a number of fundamental judgments, that need not, or cannot, be questioned by rational reflection".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But even though Cicero did at least once use the term in a manuscript on Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (concerning a primordial "sense, one and common for all [...] connected with nature"), he and other Roman authors did not normally use it as a technical term limited to discussion about sense perception, as Aristotle apparently had in ''De Anima'', and as the Scholastics later would in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bugter|1987|pages=91–92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of referring to all animal judgment, it was used to describe pre-rational, widely shared human beliefs, and therefore it was a near equivalent to the concept of {{lang|la|[[humanitas]]}}. This was a term that could be used by Romans to imply not only [[human nature]], but also humane conduct, good breeding, refined manners, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bugter|1987|page=93}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Cicero, [[Quintilian]], [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], [[Horace]] and some of the most influential Roman authors influenced by Aristotle's rhetoric and philosophy used the Latin term "{{lang|la|sensus communis}}" in a range of such ways.&lt;ref name=rethink&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[C. S. Lewis]] wrote:
{{Quote|Quintilian says it is better to send a boy to school than to have a private tutor for him at home; for if he is kept away from the herd ({{lang|la|congressus}}) how will he ever learn that {{lang|la|sensus}} which we call {{lang|la|communis}}? (I, ii, 20). On the lowest level it means tact. In Horace the man who talks to you when you obviously don't want to talk lacks {{lang|la|communis sensus}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lewis|1967|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Compared to Aristotle and his strictest medieval followers, these Roman authors were not so strict about the boundary between animal-like common sense and specially human reasoning. As discussed above, Aristotle had attempted to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, imagination and the sense perception which both use the sensible {{transl|grc|koiná}}, and which animals also have; and, on the other hand, {{transl|grc|noûs}} (intellect) and reason, which perceives another type of {{transl|grc|koiná}}, the intelligible forms, which (according to Aristotle) only humans have. In other words, these Romans allowed that people could have animal-like shared understandings of reality, not just in terms of memories of sense perceptions, but in terms of the way they would tend to explain things, and in the language they use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|van Holthoon|1987}}, chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartesian==
[[File:Descartes mind and body.gif|thumb|200px|right|[[René Descartes]]' illustration of perception. Sensations from the senses travel to {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, seated in the pineal gland inside the brain, and from there to the immaterial spirit.]]
One of the last notable philosophers to accept something like the Aristotelian "common sense" was [[Descartes]] in the 17th century, but he also undermined it. He described this inner faculty when writing in Latin in his ''[[Meditations on first philosophy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Chapter: MEDITATION II.: Of the Nature of the Human Mind ; and that It is More Easily Known than the Body.&lt;/ref&gt; The common sense is the link between the body and its senses, and the true human mind, which according to Descartes must be purely immaterial. Unlike Aristotle, who had placed it in the heart, by the time of Descartes this faculty was thought to be in the brain, and he located it in the [[pineal gland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Descartes|1901}} Chapter: MEDITATION VI.: Of the Existence of Material Things, and of the Real Distinction Between the Mind and Body of Man.&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes' judgement of this common sense was that it was enough to persuade the human consciousness of the existence of physical things, but often in a very indistinct way. To get a more distinct understanding of things, it is more important to be methodical and mathematical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Brann|1991|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This line of thought was taken further, if not by Descartes himself then by those he influenced, until the concept of a faculty or organ of common sense was itself rejected.
{{Quote|René Descartes is generally credited with making obsolete the notion that there was an actual faculty within the human brain that functioned as a {{lang|la|sensus communis}}. The French philosopher did not fully reject the idea of the inner senses, which he appropriated from the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]. But he distanced himself from the Aristotelian conception of a common sense faculty, abandoning it entirely by the time of his ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'' (1649).&lt;ref name="rosenfeld21" /&gt;}}

Contemporaries such as [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]] and [[Hobbes]] went beyond Descartes in some ways in their rejection of Aristotelianism, rejecting explanations involving anything other than matter and motion, including the distinction between the animal-like judgement of sense perception, a special separate common sense, and the human mind or {{transl|grc|noûs}}, which Descartes had retained from Aristotelianism.&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKFXRA2HPkoC&amp;pg=PA83|page=83|title=The Mechanisation of Aristotelianism: The Late Aristotelian Setting of Thomas Hobbes' Natural Philosophy| first=Cees |last=Leijenhorst| publisher=Brill|isbn=9004117296|year=2002}}. Hobbes (like Gassendi) wrote scornfully of the complex old distinctions, and in particular the medieval concept of sensible "species" (a concept derived from Aristotle's perceptibles):
{{Quote|Some say the Senses receive the Species of things, and deliver them to the Common-sense; and the Common Sense delivers them over to the Fancy, and the Fancy to the Memory, and the Memory to the Judgement, like handing of things from one to another, with many words making nothing understood. ({{citation|first=Thomas |last=Hobbes| title= The English Works of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury; Now First Collected and Edited by Sir William Molesworth, Bart., 11 vols.| volume=3 (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'')  |chapter= II.: of imagination| publication-place=London |publisher=Bohn| url= http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/585/89820/2025312}}).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Descartes who "found it unacceptable to assume that sensory representations may enter the mental realm from without"...
{{Quote|According to Hobbes [...] man is no different from the other animals. [...] Hobbes' philosophy constituted a more profound rupture with [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] thought. He accepted mental representations but [...] "All sense is fancy", as Hobbes famously put it, with the only exception of extension and motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Spruit|1995|pages=403–404}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Descartes portrait.jpg|thumb|right|René Descartes is the source of the most common way of understanding the "common sense" as a widely spread type of judgement.]]
But Descartes used two different terms in his work, not only the Latin term "{{lang|la|sensus communis}}", but also the French term {{lang|fr|bon sens}}, with which he opens his ''Discourse on Method''. And this second concept survived better. This work was written in French, and does not directly discuss the Aristotelian technical theory of perception. {{lang|fr|Bon sens}} is the equivalent of modern English "common sense" or "good sense". As the Aristotelian meaning of the Latin term began to be forgotten after Descartes, his discussion of {{lang|fr|bon sens}} gave a new way of defining {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in various European languages (including Latin, even though Descartes himself did not translate {{lang|fr|bon sens}} as {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, but treated them as two separate things).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011}}, p.&amp;nbsp;282. English is unusual in keeping one term that unites the classical and modern meanings, and philosophical and everyday meanings, so clearly. Italian has {{lang|it|senso comune}} and also {{lang|it|buon senso}}; German has {{lang|de|gemeiner Verstand}}, {{lang|de|gesunder Menschenverstand}}, and {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}}, used by Kant and others. French also has {{lang|fr|sens commun}}, used by [[Étienne Gilson]] and others. See {{harvtxt|Wierzbicka|2010}}, who also notes that according to Gilson, Descartes himself always referred to {{lang|fr|bon sens}} as {{lang|la|bona mens}} in Latin, never {{lang|la|sensus communis}} (p.&amp;nbsp;340).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=2}} writes that "Descartes is the source of the most common meaning of ''common sense'' today: practical judgment". Gilson noted that Descartes actually gave {{lang|fr|bon sens}} two related meanings, first the basic and widely shared ability to judge true and false, which he also calls {{lang|fr|raison}} ({{literal translation|'reason'|lk=on}}); and second, wisdom, the perfected version of the first. The Latin term Descartes uses, {{lang|la|bona mens}} ({{literal translation|'good mind'}}), derives from the Stoic author [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] who only used it in the second sense. Descartes was being original.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDpKI8JoLPAC&amp;pg=PA82|page=82| title=Discours de la méthode| chapter=Première Partie; Commentaire Historique| first=Etienne |last=Gilson| year=1925|isbn=9782711601806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that now became influential, developed in both the Latin and French works of Descartes, though coming from different directions, is that common good sense (and indeed sense perception) is not reliable enough for the new Cartesian method of [[skeptical]] [[reason]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heller-Roazen|2008|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cartesian project to replace common good sense with clearly defined mathematical reasoning was aimed at certainty, and not mere probability. It was promoted further by people such as Hobbes, [[Spinoza]], and others and continues to have important impacts on everyday life. In France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy, it was in its initial florescence associated with the administration of Catholic empires of the competing [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbon]], and [[Habsburg dynasty|Habsburg]] dynasties, both seeking to centralize their power in a modern way, responding to [[Machiavelli]]anism and [[Protestantism]] as part of the so-called [[counter reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|van Kessel|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Cartesian theory offered a justification for innovative social change achieved through the courts and administration, an ability to adapt the law to changing social conditions by making the basis for legislation "rational" rather than "traditional".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} So after Descartes, critical attention turned from Aristotle and his theory of perception, and more towards Descartes' own treatment of common good sense, concerning which several 18th-century authors found help in Roman literature.

==The Enlightenment after Descartes==

===Epistemology: versus claims of certainty===
During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Descartes' insistence upon a mathematical-style method of thinking that treated common sense and the sense perceptions sceptically, was accepted in some ways, but also criticized. On the one hand, the approach of Descartes is and was seen as radically sceptical in some ways. On the other hand, like the Scholastics before him, while being cautious of common sense, Descartes was instead seen to rely too much on undemonstrable metaphysical assumptions in order to justify his method, especially in its separation of mind and body (with the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} linking them). Cartesians such as [[Henricus Regius]], [[Geraud de Cordemoy]], and [[Nicolas Malebranche]] realized that Descartes's logic could give no evidence of the "external world" at all, meaning it had to be taken on faith.&lt;ref name="gil1"&gt;{{harvtxt|Gilson|1939}}, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Though his own proposed solution was even more controversial, Berkeley famously wrote that enlightenment requires a "revolt from metaphysical notions to the plain dictates of nature and common sense".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Concept of Humanity in an Age of Globalization|first=Longxi |last=Zhang| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUeeHSwEWCcC&amp;pg=PA131|page=131 |isbn=9783862349180 |date=2011-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes and the Cartesian "[[rationalists]]", rejected reliance upon experience, the senses and [[inductive reasoning]], and seemed to insist that certainty was possible. The alternative to induction, deductive reasoning, demanded a mathematical approach, starting from simple and certain assumptions. This in turn required Descartes (and later rationalists such as Kant) to assume the existence of innate or "{{lang|la|[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]}}" [[knowledge]] in the human mind—a controversial proposal.

In contrast to the rationalists, the "[[Empiricism|empiricists]]" took their orientation from [[Francis Bacon]], whose arguments for methodical science were earlier than those of Descartes, and less directed towards mathematics and certainty. Bacon is known for his doctrine of the "[[idols of the mind]]", presented in his ''[[Novum Organum]]'', and in his ''[[Essays (Francis Bacon)|Essays]]'' described normal human thinking as biased towards believing in lies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Francis |last=Bacon |title=On Truth |url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/bacon_essays.html |access-date=2013-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629183522/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/bacon/bacon_essays.html |archive-date=2013-06-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But he was also the opponent of all metaphysical explanations of nature, or over-reaching speculation generally, and a proponent of science based on small steps of experience,  experimentation and methodical induction. So while agreeing upon the need to help common sense with a methodical approach, he also insisted that starting from common sense, including especially common sense perceptions, was acceptable and correct. He influenced [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Pierre Bayle]], in their critique of metaphysics, and in 1733 [[Voltaire]] "introduced him as the "father" of the [[scientific method]]" to a French audience, an understanding that was widespread by 1750. Together with this, references to "common sense" became positive and associated with modernity, in contrast to negative references to metaphysics, which was associated with the {{lang|fr|[[Ancien Régime]]}}.&lt;ref name="hund" /&gt;

As mentioned above, in terms of the more general epistemological implications of common sense, modern philosophy came to use the term common sense like Descartes, abandoning Aristotle's theory. While Descartes had distanced himself from it, [[John Locke]] abandoned it more openly, while still maintaining the idea of "common sensibles" that are perceived. But then [[George Berkeley]] abandoned both.&lt;ref name="rosenfeld21"&gt;{{harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011|page=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hume]] agreed with Berkeley on this, and like Locke and Vico saw himself as following Bacon more than Descartes. In his synthesis, which he saw as the first Baconian analysis of man (something the lesser known Vico had claimed earlier), common sense is entirely built up from shared experience and shared innate emotions, and therefore it is indeed imperfect as a basis for any attempt to know the truth or to make the best decision. But he defended the possibility of science without absolute certainty, and consistently described common sense as giving a valid answer to the challenge of [[Pyrrhonian skepticism|extreme skepticism]]. Concerning such sceptics, he wrote:
{{Quote|But would these prejudiced reasoners reflect a moment, there are many obvious instances and arguments, sufficient to undeceive them, and make them enlarge their maxims and principles. Do they not see the vast variety of inclinations and pursuits among our species; where each man seems fully satisfied with his own course of life, and would esteem it the greatest unhappiness to be confined to that of his neighbour? Do they not feel in themselves, that what pleases at one time, displeases at another, by the change of inclination; and that it is not in their power, by their utmost efforts, to recall that taste or appetite, which formerly bestowed charms on what now appears indifferent or disagreeable? [...] Do you come to a philosopher as to a cunning man, to learn something by magic or witchcraft, beyond what can be known by common prudence and discretion?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hume|1987}} Chapter: ESSAY XVIII: THE SCEPTIC&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ethics: "humanist"===
[[File:Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3. Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|right|thumb|Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury, and proponent of a Roman-inspired concept of common sense.]]
Once Thomas Hobbes and [[Spinoza]] had applied Cartesian approaches to [[political philosophy]], concerns about the inhumanity of the deductive approach of Descartes increased. With this in mind, [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and, much less known at the time, [[Giambattista Vico]], both presented new arguments for the importance of the Roman understanding of common sense, in what is now often referred to, after [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], as a [[Renaissance Humanist|humanist]] interpretation of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=19–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their concern had several inter-related aspects. One ethical concern was the deliberately simplified method that treated human communities as made up of selfish independent individuals ([[methodological individualism]]), ignoring the ''[[sense of community]]'' that the Romans understood as part of common sense. Another connected epistemological concern was that by considering ''common good sense'' as inherently inferior to Cartesian conclusions developed from simple assumptions, an important type of wisdom was being arrogantly ignored.

Shaftesbury's seminal 1709 essay ''Sensus Communis: An Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour'' was a highly erudite and influential defense of the use of irony and humour in serious discussions, at least among men of "Good Breeding". He drew upon authors such as [[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]], [[Juvenal]], [[Horace]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]], for whom, he saw, common sense was not just a reference to widely held vulgar opinions, but something cultivated among educated people living in better communities. One aspect of this, later taken up by authors such as Kant, was good taste. Another very important aspect of common sense particularly interesting to later British political philosophers such as [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] was what came to be called ''moral sentiment'', which is different from a tribal or factional sentiment, but a more general fellow feeling that is very important for larger communities:
{{Quote|A {{Not a typo|public|k}} Spirit can come only from a social Feeling or ''Sense of Partnership'' with Human Kind. Now there are none so far from being ''Partners'' in this ''Sense'', or sharers in this ''common Affection'', as they who scarcely know ''an {{Not a typo|Equal|l}}'', nor consider themselves as subject to any law of ''Fellowship'' or ''Community''. And thus Morality and good Government go together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Shaftesbury|2001}}, Volume I, Part III, section 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hutcheson described it as, "a Publick Sense, viz. "our Determination to be pleased with the Happiness of others, and to be uneasy at their Misery."" which, he explains, "was sometimes called {{lang|grc|κοινονοημοσύνη}}&lt;ref&gt;Although Greek, this term {{lang|grc|koinonoēmosúnē}} is from the ''Meditations'' of the Roman emperor-philosopher, Marcus Aurelius, and was possibly coined by him. However Shaftesbury and others suspect it is a Stoic term. (Not many Stoic texts have survived.)&lt;/ref&gt; or Sensus Communis by some of the Antients".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Francis |last=Hutcheson| title=An Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions and Affections, with Illustrations on the Moral Sense, ed. Aaron Garrett |publication-place=Indianapolis| publisher=Liberty Fund|year= 2002| chapter= section i: A general Account of our several Senses and Desires, Selfish or Publick|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/885/65922/1605681 |accessdate= 2013-07-25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A reaction to Shaftesbury in defense of the Hobbesian approach of treating communities as driven by individual self-interest, was not long coming in [[Bernard Mandeville]]'s controversial works. Indeed, this approach was never fully rejected, at least in economics. And so despite the criticism heaped upon Mandeville and Hobbes by Adam Smith, Hutcheson's student and successor in Glasgow university, Smith made self-interest a core assumption within nascent modern economics, specifically as part of the practical justification for allowing free markets.

By the late enlightenment period in the 18th century, the communal sense or empathy pointed to by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had become the "moral sense" or "[[moral sentiment]]" referred to by Hume and [[Adam Smith]], the latter writing in plural of the "moral sentiments" with the key one being ''[[sympathy]]'', which was not so much a public spirit as such, but a kind of extension of self-interest. [[Jeremy Bentham]] gives a summary of the plethora of terms used in British philosophy by the nineteenth century to describe common sense in discussions about ethics:
{{Quote|Another man comes and alters the phrase: leaving out moral, and putting in ''common'', in the room of it. He then tells you, that his common sense teaches him what is right and wrong, as surely as the other's moral sense did: meaning by common sense, a sense of some kind or other, which he says, is possessed by all mankind: the sense of those, whose sense is not the same as the author's, being struck out of the account as not worth taking.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter II, "OF PRINCIPLES ADVERSE TO THAT OF UTILITY", in "[http://oll.libertyfund.org/title/278/20719/941780 An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]".&lt;/ref&gt;}} This was at least to some extent opposed to the Hobbesian approach, still today normal in economic theory, of trying to understand all human behaviour as fundamentally selfish, and would also be a foil to the new ethics of Kant. This understanding of a moral sense or public spirit remains a subject for discussion, although the term "common sense" is no longer commonly used for the sentiment itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In several European languages, a separate term for this type of common sense is used. For example, French {{lang|fr|sens commun}} and German {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}} are used for this feeling of human solidarity, while {{lang|fr|bon sens}} (good sense) and {{lang|de|gesunder Verstand}} (healthy understanding) are the terms for everyday "common sense".

According to Gadamer, at least in French and British philosophy a moral element in appeals to common sense (or {{lang|fr|bon sens}}), such as found in Reid, remains normal to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=25–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; But according to Gadamer, the civic quality implied in discussion of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in other European countries did not take root in the German philosophy of the 18th and 19th centuries, despite the fact it consciously imitated much in English and French philosophy. "{{lang|la|Sensus communis|italic=no}} was understood as a purely theoretical judgment, parallel to moral consciousness ([[conscience]]) and [[taste]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} "was emptied and intellectualized by the German enlightenment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; But German philosophy was becoming internationally important at this same time.

Gadamer notes one less-known exception—the [[Württemberg pietism]], inspired by the 18th century [[Swabia]]n churchman, M. [[Friedrich Christoph Oetinger]], who appealed to Shaftesbury and other Enlightenment figures in his critique of the Cartesian rationalism of [[Leibniz]] and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]], who were the most important German philosophers before Kant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=27–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giambattista Vico===
[[File:Giovan Battista Vico.jpg|right|thumb|Giambattista Vico. A defender of classical education in rhetoric, who analysed evidence of ancient wisdom in common sense.]]
Vico, who taught classical rhetoric in [[Naples]] (where Shaftesbury died) under a Cartesian-influenced Spanish government, was not widely read until the 20th century, but his writings on common sense have been an important influence upon [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Antonio Gramsci#Hegemony|Antonio Gramsci]].&lt;ref name="Bugter1987" /&gt; Vico united the Roman and Greek meanings of the term {{lang|la|communis sensus}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990|page=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Vico's initial use of the term, which was of much inspiration to Gadamer for example, appears in his ''On the Study Methods of our Time'', which was partly a defense of his own profession, given the reformist pressure upon both his University and the legal system in Naples. It presents common sense as something adolescents need to be trained in if they are not to "break into odd and arrogant behaviour when adulthood is reached", whereas teaching Cartesian method on its own harms common sense and stunts intellectual development. Rhetoric and elocution are not just for legal debate, but also educate young people to use their sense perceptions and their perceptions more broadly, building a fund of remembered images in their imagination, and then using ingenuity in creating linking metaphors, in order to make [[enthymeme]]s. Enthymemes are reasonings about uncertain truths and probabilities—as opposed to the Cartesian method, which was skeptical of all that could not be dealt with as [[syllogism]]s, including raw perceptions of physical bodies. Hence common sense is not just a "guiding standard of [[eloquence]]" but also "the standard of [[practical judgment]]". The imagination or fantasy, which under traditional Aristotelianism was often equated with the {{transl|grc|koinḕ aísthēsis}}, is built up under this training, becoming the "fund" (to use Schaeffer's term) accepting not only memories of things seen by an individual, but also metaphors and images known in the community, including the ones out of which language itself is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its mature version, Vico's conception of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} is defined by him as "judgment without reflection, shared by an entire class, an entire people, and entire nation, or the entire human race". Vico proposed his own anti-Cartesian methodology for a new Baconian science, inspired, he said, by [[Plato]], [[Tacitus]],&lt;ref&gt;As remarked by several commentators such as Croce and [[Leo Strauss]], during this period citation of Tacitus is referred to as [[Tacitean]]ism, and was often a veiled way of showing the influence of [[Machiavelli]]. Citing Plato on the other hand, shows the typical rejection in this period of Aristotle and scholasticism, but not classical learning in its entirety.&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Bacon and [[Grotius]]. In this he went further than his predecessors concerning the ancient certainties available within vulgar common sense. What is required, according to his new science, is to find the common sense shared by different people and nations. He made this a basis for a new and better-founded approach to discuss [[Natural Law]], improving upon Grotius, [[John Selden]], and [[Pufendorf]] who he felt had failed to convince, because they could claim no authority from nature. Unlike Grotius, Vico went beyond looking for one single set of similarities amongst nations but also established rules about how natural law properly changes as peoples change, and has to be judged relative to this state of development. He thus developed a detailed view of an evolving wisdom of peoples. Ancient forgotten wisdoms, he claimed, could be re-discovered by analysis of languages and myths formed under the influence of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Vico|1968}}, I.ii "Elements" (§§141-146) and I.iv "Method" (§§347-350).&lt;/ref&gt; This is comparable to both [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[Spirit of the Laws]]'', as well as much later [[Hegel]]ian [[historicism]], both of which apparently developed without any awareness of Vico's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cklawreview.com/wp-content/uploads/vol83no3/Bayer.pdf|last=Bayer|journal=Chicago-Kent Law Review|volume=83|issue=3|year=1990|title=Vico's principle of ''sensus communis'' and forensic eloquence}}. Also see {{Harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, p.&amp;nbsp;3, and Gadamer.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Reid and the Scottish school===
[[File:ThomasReid.jpg|right|thumb|Thomas Reid, founder of the Scottish school of Common Sense.]]
Contemporary with Hume, but critical of Hume's scepticism, a so-called [[Scottish Common Sense Realism|Scottish school of Common Sense]] formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, [[Thomas Reid]]:
{{Quote|If there are certain principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take for granted in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Cuneo |editor2-last=Woudenberg|title=The Cambridge companion to Thomas Reid|year=2004| page= 85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpQAg6CTl3QC&amp;pg=PA85|isbn=9780521012089}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thomas Reid was a successor to Francis Hutcheson and Adam Smith as [[Professor of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow]]. While Reid's interests lay in the defense of common sense as a type of self-evident knowledge available to individuals, this was also part of a defense of natural law in the style of Grotius. He believed that the term common sense as he used it did encompass both the social common sense described by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, and the perceptive powers described by Aristotelians.

Reid was criticised, partly for his critique of Hume, by Kant and [[J. S. Mill]], who were two of the most important influences in nineteenth century philosophy. He was blamed for over-stating Hume's scepticism of commonly held beliefs, and more importantly for not perceiving the problem with any claim that common sense could ever fulfill Cartesian (or Kantian) demands for absolute knowledge. Reid furthermore emphasized inborn common sense as opposed to only experience and sense perception. In this way his common sense has a similarity to the assertion of {{lang|la|a priori}} knowledge asserted by rationalists like Descartes and Kant, despite Reid's criticism of Descartes concerning his theory of ideas. Hume was critical of Reid on this point.

Despite the criticism, the influence of the Scottish school was notable for example upon American [[pragmatism]], and modern [[Thomism]]. The influence has been particularly important concerning the epistemological importance of a {{lang|la|sensus communis}} for any possibility of rational discussion between people.

==Kant: In aesthetic taste==
[[File:Kant foto.jpg|right|thumb|Immanuel Kant proposed that {{lang|la|sensus communis}} ({{lang-de|Gemeinsinn}}) was a useful concept for understanding aesthetics, but he was critical of the Scottish school's appeals to ordinary widely shared common sense ({{lang|de|gesunden Verstand}}) as a basis of real knowledge.]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] developed a new variant of the idea of {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, noting how having a sensitivity for what opinions are widely shared and comprehensible gives a sort of standard for judgment, and objective discussion, at least in the field of [[aesthetics]] and taste:

{{Quote|multiline=y|''The common Understanding of men'' [{{lang|de|gemeine Menschenverstand}}], which, as the mere sound (not yet cultivated) Understanding, we regard as the least to be expected from any one claiming the name of man, has therefore the doubtful honour of being given the name of common sense [{{lang|de|Namen des Gemeinsinnes}}] ({{lang|la|sensus communis}}); and in such a way that by the name common (not merely in our language, where the word actually has a double signification, but in many others) we understand vulgar, that which is everywhere met with, the possession of which indicates absolutely no merit or superiority.

But under the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} we must include the Idea of a ''communal'' sense [{{lang|de|eines gemeinschaftlichen Sinnes}}], i.e. of a faculty of judgement, which in its reflection takes account ({{lang|la|a priori|italic=no}}) of the mode of representation of all other men in thought; in order as it were to compare its judgement with the collective Reason of humanity, and thus to escape the illusion arising from the private conditions that could be so easily taken for objective, which would injuriously affect the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kant|1914}}. Key German terms are added in square brackets. See [http://www.korpora.org/Kant/aa05/293.html German text].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kant saw this concept as answering a particular need in his system: "the question of why aesthetic judgments are valid: since aesthetic judgments are a perfectly normal function of the same faculties of cognition involved in ordinary cognition, they will have the same universal validity as such ordinary acts of cognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/kantaest/|title=Kant's Aesthetics|first=Douglas |last=Burnham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But Kant's overall approach was very different from those of Hume or Vico. Like Descartes, he rejected appeals to uncertain sense perception and common sense (except in the very specific way he describes concerning aesthetics), or the prejudices of one's "{{lang|de|[[Weltanschauung]]}}", and tried to give a new way to certainty through methodical logic, and an assumption of a type of {{lang|la|[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]}} knowledge. He was also not in agreement with Reid and the Scottish school, who he criticized in his ''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics]]'' as using "the magic wand of common sense", and not properly confronting the "metaphysical" problem defined by Hume, which Kant wanted to be solved scientifically—the problem of how to use reason to consider how one ought to act.

Kant used different words to refer to his aesthetic {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, for which he used Latin or else German {{lang|de|Gemeinsinn}}, and the more general English meaning which he associated with Reid and his followers, for which he used various terms such as {{lang|de|gemeinen Menscheverstand}}, {{lang|de|gesunden Verstand}}, or {{lang|de|gemeinen Verstand}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rosenfeld|2011}}, p.&amp;nbsp;312, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gadamer, in contrast to the "wealth of meaning" that Vico and Shaftesbury brought from the Roman tradition into their humanism, Kant "developed his moral philosophy in explicit opposition to the doctrine of "moral feeling" that had been worked out in English philosophy". The [[moral imperative]] "cannot be based on feeling, not even if one does not mean an individual's feeling but common moral sensibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=32–34}}. Note: The source makes it clear that "English" includes Scottish authors.&lt;/ref&gt; For Kant, the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} only applied to taste, and the meaning of taste was also narrowed as it was no longer understood as any kind of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taste, for Kant, is universal only in that it results from "the free play of all our cognitive powers", and is communal only in that it "abstracts from all subjective, private conditions such as attractiveness and emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gadamer|1989|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant himself did not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give knowledge a more solid basis, but as [[Richard J. Bernstein]] remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:
{{Quote|Once we begin to question whether there is a common faculty of taste (a {{lang|la|sensus communis}}), we are easily led down the path to [[relativism]]. And this is what did happen after Kant—so much so that today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Richard| last=Bernstein| title=Beyond Objectivism and Relativism: Science, Hermeneutics, and Praxis| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=guJ0-eBoFAEC| year=1983| isbn=0812205502}}, p.&amp;nbsp;120.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Contemporary philosophy==

===Epistemology===
Continuing the tradition of Reid and the enlightenment generally, the common sense of individuals trying to understand reality continues to be a serious subject in philosophy. In America, Reid influenced [[C. S. Peirce]], the founder of the philosophical movement now known as [[Pragmatism]], which has become internationally influential. One of the names Peirce used for the movement was "Critical Common-Sensism". Peirce, who wrote after [[Charles Darwin]], suggested that Reid and Kant's ideas about inborn common sense could be explained by evolution. But while such beliefs might be well adapted to primitive conditions, they were not infallible, and could not always be relied upon.

Another example still influential today is from [[G. E. Moore]], several of whose essays, such as the 1925 "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]", argued that individuals can make many types of statements about what they judge to be true, and that the individual and everyone else knows to be true. [[Michael Huemer]] has advocated an epistemic theory he calls ''[[phenomenal conservatism]]'', which he claims to accord with common sense by way of [[Internalism and externalism|internalist]] [[intuition]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/phen-con/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics: what the community would think===
In twentieth century philosophy the concept of the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as discussed by Vico and especially Kant became a major topic of philosophical discussion. The theme of this discussion questions how far the understanding of eloquent rhetorical discussion (in the case of Vico), or communally sensitive aesthetic tastes (in the case of Kant) can give a standard or model for political, ethical and legal discussion in a world where forms of [[relativism]] are commonly accepted, and serious dialogue between very different nations is essential. Some philosophers such as [[Jacques Rancière]] indeed take the lead from [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and refer to the "[[postmodern]]" condition as one where there is "{{lang|la|dissensus communis}}".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor1-last=van Haute|editor2-last=Birmingham|title=Dissensus Communis: Between Ethics and Politics|year=1995|publisher=Kok Pharos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BK9OTGZ62NEC|isbn=9789039004036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hannah Arendt cropped.jpg|right|thumb|Hannah Arendt, who proposed an adaptation of Kant's aesthetic concept of common sense as having broader relevance to political philosophy.]]

[[Hannah Arendt]] adapted Kant's concept of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as a faculty of aesthetic judgement that imagines the judgements of others, into something relevant for political judgement. Thus she created a "Kantian" political philosophy, which, as she said herself, Kant did not write. She argued that there was often a banality to evil in the real world, for example in the case of someone like [[Adolf Eichmann]], which consisted in a lack of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} and thoughtfulness generally. Arendt and also [[Jürgen Habermas]], who took a similar position concerning Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}}, were criticised by Lyotard for their use of Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as a standard for real political judgement. Lyotard also saw Kant's {{lang|la|sensus communis}} as an important concept for understanding political judgement, not aiming at any consensus, but rather at a possibility of a "[[euphony]]" in "dis-sensus". Lyotard claimed that any attempt to impose any {{lang|la|sensus communis}} in real politics would mean imposture by an empowered faction upon others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Judging Lyotard| editor-first=Andrew |editor-last=Benjamin| year=1992| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qy17kj4oFocC| isbn=9781134940622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a parallel development, [[Antonio Gramsci]], Benedetto Croce, and later Hans-Georg Gadamer took inspiration from Vico's understanding of common sense as a kind of wisdom of nations, going beyond Cartesian method. It has been suggested that Gadamer's most well-known work, ''[[Truth and Method]]'', can be read as an "extended meditation on the implications of Vico's defense of the rhetorical tradition in response to the nascent methodologism that ultimately dominated academic enquiry".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gadamer and Ricoeur: Critical Horizons for Contemporary Hermeneutics| editor1-first=Francis J. |editor1-last=Mootz III| editor2-first= George H. |editor2-last=Taylor| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIj4Gi11pJgC|page=84|last=Mootz|chapter=Gadamer's Rhetorical Conception of Hermeneutics as the key to developing a Critical Hermeneutics| isbn=9781441175991 | date=2011-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Gadamer, this was in specific contrast to the {{lang|la|sensus communis}} concept in Kant, which he felt (in agreement with Lyotard) could not be relevant to politics if used in its original sense.

Gadamer came into direct debate with his contemporary Habermas, the so-called {{lang|de|[[Hermeneutikstreit]]}}. Habermas, with a self-declared Enlightenment "prejudice against prejudice" argued that if breaking free from the restraints of language is not the aim of dialectic, then social science will be dominated by whoever wins debates, and thus Gadamer's defense of {{lang|la|sensus communis}} effectively defends traditional prejudices. Gadamer argued that being critical requires being critical of prejudices including the prejudice against prejudice. Some prejudices will be true. And Gadamer did not share Habermas' acceptance that aiming at going beyond language through method was not itself potentially dangerous. Furthermore, he insisted that because all understanding comes through language, hermeneutics has a claim to universality. As Gadamer wrote in the "Afterword" of ''[[Truth and Method]]'', "I find it frighteningly unreal when people like Habermas ascribe to rhetoric a compulsory quality that one must reject in favor of unconstrained, rational dialogue".

[[Paul Ricoeur]] argued that Gadamer and Habermas were both right in part. As a hermeneutist like Gadamer he agreed with him about the problem of lack of any perspective outside of history, pointing out that Habermas himself argued as someone coming from a particular tradition. He also agreed with Gadamer that hermeneutics is a "basic kind of knowing on which others rest."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_KoqK3bl2MAC&amp;pg=PA149|page=149|title=Theology After Ricoeur: New Directions in Hermeneutical Theology
|first= Dan |last= Stiver|year=2001|isbn=9780664222437}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he felt that Gadamer under-estimated the need for a dialectic that was critical and distanced, and attempting to go behind language.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Gadamer and Ricoeur: Critical Horizons for Contemporary Hermeneutics| editor1-first= Francis J. |editor1-last=Mootz III| editor2-first=George H. |editor2-last=Taylor| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nIj4Gi11pJgC|chapter=Paul Ricoeur's and Hans-Georg Gadamer's diverging reflections on recognition|last=Vessey| isbn= 9781441175991 | date= 2011-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Paul Ricoeur: The Promise and Risk of Politics|first= Bernard |last= Dauenhauer|year=1998|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ifdWn6SuswMC|isbn= 9780585177724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent commentator on Vico, John D. Schaeffer has argued that Gadamer's approach to {{lang|la|sensus communis}} exposed itself to the criticism of Habermas because it "privatized" it, removing it from a changing and oral community, following the Greek philosophers in rejecting true communal rhetoric, in favour of forcing the concept within a [[Socratic dialectic]] aimed at truth. Schaeffer claims that Vico's concept provides a third option to those of Habermas and Gadamer and he compares it to the recent philosophers [[Richard J. Bernstein]], [[Bernard Williams]], [[Richard Rorty]], and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and the recent theorist of rhetoric, [[Richard Lanham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schaeffer|1990}}, chapters 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Moral sense" as opposed to "rationality"===
The other Enlightenment debate about common sense, concerning common sense as a term for an emotion or drive that is unselfish, also continues to be important in discussion of social science, and especially [[economics]]. The axiom that communities can be usefully modeled as a collection of [[homo economicus|self-interested individuals]] is a central assumption in much of modern [[mathematical economics]], and mathematical economics has now come to be an influential tool of political decision making.

While the term "common sense" had already become less commonly used as a term for the empathetic moral sentiments by the time of Adam Smith, debates continue about [[methodological individualism]] as something supposedly justified philosophically for methodological reasons (as argued for example by [[Milton Friedman]] and more recently by [[Gary Becker|Gary S. Becker]], both members of the so-called [[Chicago school of economics]]).&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Albert O. Hirschman]], "Against Parsimony: Three Easy Ways of Complicating Some Categories of Economic Discourse." Bulletin of the ''American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' 37, {{abbr|no.|number}} 8 (May '''1984'''): 11–28.&lt;/ref&gt; As in the Enlightenment, this debate therefore continues to combine debates about not only what the individual motivations of people are, but also what can be known about scientifically, and what should be usefully assumed for methodological reasons, even if the truth of the assumptions are strongly doubted. Economics and social science generally have been criticized as a refuge of Cartesian methodology. Hence, amongst critics of the methodological argument for assuming self-centeredness in economics are authors such as [[Deirdre McCloskey]], who have taken their bearings from the above-mentioned philosophical debates involving Habermas, Gadamer, the anti-Cartesian [[Richard Rorty]] and others, arguing that trying to force economics to follow artificial methodological laws is bad, and it is better to recognize social science as driven by rhetoric.

==Catholic theology==
Among Catholic theologians, writers such as theologian [[François Fénelon]] and philosopher [[Claude Buffier]] (1661–1737) gave an anti-Cartesian defense of common sense as a foundation for knowledge. Other catholic theologians took up this approach, and attempts were made to combine this with more traditional Thomism, for example [[Jean-Marie de Lamennais]]. This was similar to the approach of Thomas Reid, who for example was a direct influence on [[Théodore Simon Jouffroy|Théodore Jouffroy]]. This however meant basing knowledge upon something uncertain, and irrational. [[Matteo Liberatore]], seeking an approach more consistent with Aristotle and Aquinas, equated this foundational common sense with the {{transl|grc|koinaí dóxai}} of Aristotle, that correspond to the {{lang|la|communes conceptiones}} of Aquinas.&lt;ref name="gil1" /&gt; In the twentieth century, this debate is especially associated with [[Étienne Gilson]] and [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]].&lt;ref name="murph"&gt;{{citation|title= Art and Intellect in the Philosophy of Etienne Gilson| first= Francesca |last= Aran Murphy|year= 2004| publisher= University of Missouri Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix8sIb9w1tsC| isbn= 9780826262387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilson pointed out that Liberatore's approach means categorizing such common beliefs as the existence of God or the immortality of the soul, under the same heading as (in Aristotle and Aquinas) such logical beliefs as that it is impossible for something to exist and not exist at the same time. This, according to Gilson, is going beyond the original meaning. Concerning Liberatore he wrote:

{{Quote|Endeavours of this sort always end in defeat. In order to confer a technical philosophical value upon the common sense of orators and moralists it is necessary either to accept Reid's common sense as a sort of unjustified and unjustifiable instinct, which will destroy Thomism, or to reduce it to the Thomist [[nous|intellect]] and reason, which will result in its being suppressed as a specifically distinct faculty of knowledge. In short, there can be no middle ground between Reid and St. Thomas.&lt;ref name="gil1" /&gt;}}

Gilson argued that Thomism avoided the problem of having to decide between Cartesian innate certainties and Reid's uncertain common sense, and that "as soon as the problem of the existence of the external world was presented in terms of common sense, Cartesianism was accepted".&lt;ref name="murph" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2939">A '''Darwin machine''' (a 1987 coinage by [[William H. Calvin]], by [[analogy]] to a [[Turing machine]]) is a machine that, like a Turing machine, involves an [[iteration]] process that yields a high-quality result, but, whereas a Turing machine uses [[logic]], the Darwin machine uses rounds of variation, [[Selection (biology)|selection]], and [[inheritance]].
 
In its original connotation, a Darwin machine is any process that [[Bootstrapping|bootstrap]]s quality by utilizing all of the six essential features of a Darwinian process:  A ''pattern'' is ''copied'' with ''variations'', where populations of one variant pattern ''compete'' with another population, their relative success biased by a ''multifaceted environment'' ([[natural selection]]) so that winners predominate in producing the further variants of the next generation (Darwin's ''inheritance principle'').

More loosely, a Darwin machine is a process that utilizes some subset of the Darwinian essentials, typically [[natural selection]] to create a non-reproducing pattern, as in [[neural Darwinism]]. Many aspects of [[neural development]] utilize overgrowth followed by pruning to a pattern, but the resulting pattern does not itself create further copies.

''Darwin machine'' has been used multiple times to name computer programs after [[Charles Darwin]].

In classical [[Freudian]] [[psychoanalytic theory]], the '''death drive''' ({{lang-de|Todestrieb}}) is the [[Drive theory|drive]] toward death and self-destruction. It was originally proposed by [[Sabina Spielrein]] in her paper "Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spielrein |first=Sabina |date=April 1994 |title=Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being |journal=Journal of Analytical Psychology |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=155–186 |doi=10.1111/j.1465-5922.1994.00155.x}} [http://www.arizonapsychoanalyticsociety.com/downloads/sabrina.pdf Free pdf of the full essay] by the Arizona Psychoanalytic Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spielrein |first=Sabina |year=1995 |title=Destruction as Cause of Becoming |journal=Psychoanalysis and Contemporary Thought |volume=18 |issue= |pages=85–118|doi= |url=http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=pct.018.0085a}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens'')&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite journal |last=Spielrein |first=Sabina |year=1912 |title=''Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens'' |journal=Jahrbuch für Psychoanalytische und Psychopathologische Forschungen |volume=IV |issue= |pages=465–503 |doi= |url=https://archive.org/stream/JahrbuchFuumlrPsychoanalytischeUndPsychopathologischeForschungenIv_509/JdP_IV_1912_1_Haelfte#page/n467/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1912, which was then taken up by [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1920 in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]].'' This concept has been translated as "opposition between the ego or death [[instinct]]s and the sexual or life instincts".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Beyond the Pleasure Principle" in ''On Metapsychology'' (Middlesex 1987), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Pleasure Principle'', Freud used the plural "death drives" (''Todestriebe'') much more frequently than in the singular.&lt;ref&gt;See occurrences of [https://books.google.com/?id=LQcUz3FVkNQC&amp;q=%22death+drives%22 "death drives"] and of [https://books.google.com/?id=LQcUz3FVkNQC&amp;q=%22death+drive%22 "death drive"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The death drive opposes [[Eros (concept)#Sigmund Freud|Eros]], the tendency toward survival, propagation, sex, and other creative, life-producing drives. The death drive is sometimes referred to as "[[Thanatos]]" in post-Freudian thought, complementing "Eros", although this term was not used in Freud's own work, being rather introduced by [[Wilhelm Stekel]] in 1909 and then by [[Paul Federn]] in the present context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Ernest |authorlink=Ernest Jones |title=The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud.

The Standard Edition of Freud's works in English confuses two terms that are different in German, ''Instinkt'' ("instinct") and ''Trieb'' ("drive"), often translating both as ''instinct''; for example, "the hypothesis of a ''death instinct'', the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "The Ego and the Id", in ''On Metapsychology'' (Middlesex, 1987), p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; "This equating of ''instinkt'' and ''Trieb'' has created serious misunderstandings".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'', (London, 1946), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (1988) [1973]. "[https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=%22Instinct+(or+Drive)+=+I.+D.:+Instinkt%22%22D.:+Trieb%22 Instinct (or Drive) (pp. 214-7).]"&lt;/ref&gt; Freud actually refers to the term "instinkt" in explicit use elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Instinct and Drive (pp. 19ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=qbWuAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=%22Instinct+and+Drive%22 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Theory of Instincts |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qbWuAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2014 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=qnowAAAAIAAJ 1970] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |isbn=978-1-317-67045-2 |id={{ISBN|1-31767045-0}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so while the concept of "instinct" can loosely be referred to as a "drive," any essentialist or naturalist connotations of the term should be put in abeyance. In a sense, the death drive is a force that is not essential to the life of an organism (unlike an "instinct") and tends to denature it or make it behave in ways that are sometimes counter-intuitive. In other words, the term death "drive" is simply a false representation of death instinct. The term is almost universally known in scholarly literature on Freud as the "death drive", and Lacanian psychoanalysts often shorten it to simply "drive" (although Freud posited the existence of other drives as well, and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] explicitly states in Seminar XI that all drives are partial to the death drive).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The four fundamental concepts of psychoanalysis|last=|first=|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=|isbn=9780393317756|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary Penguin translations of Freud translate ''Trieb'' and ''Instinkt'' as "drive" and "instinct" respectively.

==Origin of the theory: ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle''==
{{Main|Beyond the Pleasure Principle}}
{{Anchors|origin}}It was a basic premise of Freud's that "the course taken by mental events is automatically regulated by the pleasure principle...[associated] with an avoidance of unpleasure or a production of pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond the Pleasure Principle", p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Three main types of conflictual evidence, difficult to explain satisfactorily in such terms, led Freud late in his career to look for another principle in mental life ''beyond'' the [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]]—a search that would ultimately lead him to the concept of the death drive.

The first problem Freud encountered was the phenomenon of repetition in (war) trauma. When Freud worked with people with [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] (particularly the trauma experienced by soldiers returning from [[World War I]]), he observed that subjects often tended to repeat or re-enact these traumatic experiences: "dreams occurring in traumatic have the characteristic of repeatedly bringing the patient back into the situation of his accident",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to the expectations of the pleasure principle.

A second problematic area was found by Freud in children's [[Play (activity)|play]] (such as the ''Fort/Da'' [Forth/here] game played by Freud's grandson, who would stage and re-stage the disappearance of his mother and even himself). "How then does his repetition of this distressing experience as a game fit in with the pleasure principle?"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third problem came from clinical practice.  Freud found his patients, dealing with painful experiences that had been repressed, regularly "obliged to ''repeat'' the repressed material as a contemporary experience instead of [...] ''remembering'' it as something belonging to the past".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond" p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with what he called "the compulsion of destiny [...] come across [in] people all of whose human relationships have the same outcome",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond" p. 294 and p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; such evidence led Freud "to justify the hypothesis of a compulsion to repeat—something that would seem more primitive, more elementary, more instinctual than the pleasure principle which it over-rides".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

He then set out to find an explanation of such a compulsion; in Freud's own words, "What follows is speculation, often far-fetched speculation, which the reader will consider or dismiss according to his individual predilection".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking a new instinctual paradigm for such problematic repetition, he found it ultimately in "''an urge in organic life to restore an earlier state of things''"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;—the inorganic state from which life originally emerged. From the conservative, restorative character of instinctual life, Freud derived his death drive, with its "pressure towards death", and the resulting "separation of the death instincts from the life instincts"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", pp. 316 and 322.&lt;/ref&gt; seen in Eros. The death drive then manifested itself in the individual creature as a force "whose function is to assure that the organism shall follow its own path to death".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking further potential clinical support for the existence of such a self-destructive force, Freud found it through a reconsideration of his views of masochism—previously "regarded as sadism that has been turned round upon the subject's own ego"—so as to allow that "there ''might'' be such a thing as primary masochism—a possibility which I had contested"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; before. Even with such support, however, he remained very tentative to the book's close about the provisional nature of his theoretical construct: what he called "the whole of our artificial structure of hypotheses".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Spielrein's paper was published in 1912, Freud initially resisted the concept as he considered it to be too Jungian. Nevertheless, Freud eventually adopted the concept, and in later years would build extensively upon the tentative foundations he had set out in ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle''. In ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923) he would develop his argument to state that "the death instinct would thus seem to express itself—though probably only in part—as an ''instinct of destruction'' directed against the external world".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Ego/Id", p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he would spell out more clearly that the "libido has the task of making the destroying instinct innocuous, and it fulfils the task by diverting that instinct to a great extent outwards [...]. The instinct is then called the destructive instinct, the instinct for mastery, or the will to power",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "The Economic Problem of Masochism" in ''On Metapsychology'', p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; a perhaps much more recognisable set of manifestations.

At the close of the decade, in ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1930), Freud acknowledged that "To begin with it was only tentatively that I put forward the views I have developed here, but in the course of time they have gained such a hold upon me that I can no longer think in any other way".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Civilization and Its Discontents", in ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (Middlesex, 1987), p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{see also|Arthur Schopenhauer#Philosophy of the "Will"{{!}}Philosophy of the "Will" in Schopenhauer}}
From a philosophical perspective, the death drive may be viewed in relation to the work of the German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. His philosophy, expounded in ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (1818) postulates that all exists by a metaphysical "will" (more clearly, a '''will to live'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Schopenhauer |first=Arthur |title=The World as Will and Presentation |others=Translated by Richard E. Aquila and David Carus |location= New York |publisher= Longman |year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and that pleasure affirms this will. Schopenhauer's [[pessimism]] led him to believe that the affirmation of the "will" was a negative and immoral thing, due to his belief of life producing more suffering than happiness. The death drive would seem to manifest as a natural and psychological negation of the "will".

Freud was well aware of such possible linkages. In a letter of 1919, he wrote that regarding "the theme of death, [that I] have stumbled onto an odd idea via the drives and must now read all sorts of things that belong to it, for instance Schopenhauer".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Peter Gay, ''Freud: A life for our time'' (London, 1989), p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, [[Ernest Jones]] (who like many analysts was not convinced of the need for the death drive, over and above an instinct of aggression) considered that "Freud seemed to have landed in the position of Schopenhauer, who taught that 'death is the goal of life'".&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (London, 1964), p. 508.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as Freud put it to the imagined auditors of his ''New Introductory Lectures'' (1932), "You may perhaps shrug your shoulders and say: "That isn't natural science, it's Schopenhauer's philosophy!" But, ladies and gentlemen, why should not a bold thinker have guessed something that is afterwards confirmed by sober and painstaking detailed research?"&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (London, 1991), pp. 140-1.&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on to add that "what we are saying is not even genuine Schopenhauer....we are not overlooking the fact that there is life as well as death. We recognise two basic instincts and give each of them its own aim".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural application: ''Civilization and Its Discontents''==
{{Main|Civilization and Its Discontents}}
Freud applied his new theoretical construct in ''Civilization and Its Discontents'' (1930) to the difficulties inherent in [[western culture|Western civilization]]—indeed, in civilization and in social life as a whole. In particular, given that "a portion of the [death] instinct is diverted towards the external world and comes to light as an instinct of aggressiveness', he saw 'the inclination to aggression [...] [as] the greatest impediment to civilization".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'' pp. 310 and 313.&lt;/ref&gt; The need to overcome such aggression entailed the formation of the [cultural] superego: "We have even been guilty of the heresy of attributing the origin of conscience to this diversion inwards of aggressiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Why War?" in ''Civilization'', p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence thereafter in the individual of the superego and a related sense of guilt—"Civilization, therefore, obtains mastery over the individual's dangerous desire for aggression by [...] setting up an agency within him to watch over it"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'', p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;—leaves an abiding sense of uneasiness inherent in civilized life, thereby providing a structural explanation for 'the suffering of civilized man'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London, 1997), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud made a further connection between [[Group (sociology)|group]] life and innate aggression, where the former comes together more closely by directing aggression to other groups, an idea later picked up by group analysts like [[Wilfred Bion]].

==Continuing development of Freud's views==
In the closing decade of Freud's life, it has been suggested, his view of the death drive changed somewhat, with "the stress much more upon the death instinct's manifestations ''outwards''".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Dickson, "Editor's Introduction", ''Civilization'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;  Given "the ubiquity of non-erotic aggressivity and destructiveness", he wrote in 1930, "I adopt the standpoint, therefore, that the inclination to aggression is an original, self-subsisting instinctual disposition in man".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'', pp. 311 and 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 he conceded of his original formulation of the death drive 'the improbability of our speculations.  A queer instinct, indeed, directed to the destruction of its own organic home!'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote moreover that "Our hypothesis is that there are two essentially different classes of instincts: the sexual instincts, understood in the widest sense—Eros, if you prefer that name—and the aggressive instincts, whose aim is destruction".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, he went so far as to suggest privately that 'We should have a neat schematic picture if we supposed that originally, at the beginning of life, all libido was directed to the inside and all aggressiveness to the outside'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud quoted by Dickson, ''Civilization'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his last writings, it was the contrast of "two basic instincts, ''Eros'' and ''the destructive instinct'' [...] our two primal instincts, ''Eros'' and ''destructiveness'',&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Standard Edition'' vol. xxiii (London 1964), pp. 148 and 246.&lt;/ref&gt; on which he laid stress.  Nevertheless, his belief in "the death instinct [...] [as] a return to an earlier state [...] into an inorganic state"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''SE'', xxiii, pp. 148-9.&lt;/ref&gt; continued to the end.

==Analytic reception==
As Freud wryly commented in 1930, "The assumption of the existence of an instinct of death or destruction has met with resistance even in analytic circles".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'', p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Ernest Jones would comment of ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'' that the book not only "displayed a boldness of speculation that was unique in all his writings" but was "further noteworthy in being the only one of Freud's which has received little acceptance on the part of his followers".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Life'', p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto Fenichel in his compendious survey of the first Freudian half-century concluded that "the facts on which Freud based his concept of a death instinct in no way necessitate the assumption [...] of a genuine self-destructive instinct".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London, 1946), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinz Hartmann]] set the tone for [[ego psychology]] when he "chose to [...] do without 'Freud's other, mainly biologically oriented set of hypotheses of the "life" and "death instincts"'".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gay, ''Freud'', pp. 402-3n.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[object relations theory]], among the independent group 'the most common repudiation was the loathsome notion of the death instinct'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Appignanesi, ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge, 2006), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, "for most analysts Freud's idea of a primitive urge towards death, of a primary masochism, was [...] bedevilled by problems".&lt;ref&gt;Gay, ''Freud'', p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the concept has been defended, extended, and carried forward by some analysts, generally those tangential to the psychoanalytic mainstream; while among the more orthodox, arguably of "those who, in contrast to most other analysts, take Freud's doctrine of the death drive seriously, K. R. Eissler has been the most persuasive—or least unpersuasive".&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 768.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melanie Klein]] and her immediate followers considered that "the infant is exposed from birth to the anxiety stirred up by the inborn polarity of instincts—the immediate conflict between the life instinct and the death instinct";&lt;ref name=Segal&gt;[[Hanna Segal]], ''Introduction to the work of Melanie Klein'' (London, 1964), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kleinians indeed built much of their theory of early childhood around the outward deflection of the latter. "This deflection of the death instinct, described by Freud, in Melanie Klein's view consists partly of a projection, partly of the conversion of the death instinct into aggression".&lt;ref name=Segal /&gt;

French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]], for his part, castigated the "refusal to accept this culminating point of Freud's doctrine [...] by those who conduct their analysis on the basis of a conception of the ''ego'' [...] that death instinct whose enigma Freud propounded for us at the height of his experience".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically, he stressed the linguistic aspects of the death drive: "the symbol is substituted for death in order to take possession of the first swelling of life [...]. There is therefore no further need to have recourse to the outworn notion of primordial masochism in order to understand the reason for the repetitive games in [...] his ''Fort!'' and in his ''Da!''."&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' pp. 124 and 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Berne]] too would proudly proclaim that he, "besides having repeated and confirmed the conventional observations of Freud, also believes right down the line with him concerning the death instinct, and the pervasiveness of the [[repetition compulsion]]".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You say After You Say Hello?'' (London, 1975) pp. 399-400.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the twenty-first century, "the death drive today [...] remains a highly controversial theory for many psychoanalysts [...] [almost] as many opinions as there are psychoanalysts".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (London, 2005), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud's conceptual opposition of death and eros drives in the human psyche was applied by Walter A. Davis in ''Deracination: Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative''&lt;ref name=Adams01&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Walter A.|title=Deracination; Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative|date=2001|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0-79144834-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Death's Dream Kingdom: The American Psyche since 9/11.''&lt;ref name=Adam02&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Walter A.|title=Death's Dream Kingdom|date=2006|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-74532468-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis described social reactions to both Hiroshima and 9/11 from the Freudian viewpoint of the death force. Unless they consciously take responsibility for the damage of those reactions, Davis claims that Americans will repeat them.

== Activism ==
Reynaga became a sex worker at 19.  After being a victim of institutional violence and experiencing imprisonment multiple times in Argentinar, she travelled to work in Spain for a time. She   returned to Argentina and founded AMMAR in 1994  in response to police harassment and violence. 

According to the organization, between 1996 and 2001, 41 member of AMMAR were murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ammar.org.ar/-Quienes-somos-.html|title=ammar.org.ar|website=www.ammar.org.ar|access-date=2018-06-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016135956/http://www.ammar.org.ar/-Quienes-somos-.html|archivedate=2017-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMMAR operates as a trade union and since 1995 it has been an affiliated member of the [[Argentine Workers' Central Union]] (''Central de Trabajadores de la Argentina''). AMMAR has also been part of RedTraSex since 1997;  Reynaga has been its Executive Secretary since 1999. The organization works for the defence, promotion, recognition and respect for human rights of sex workers in fifteen countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redtrasex.org/-Sobre-Nosotras-|title=RedTraSex|website=www.redtrasex.org|access-date=2018-06-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205234300/http://www.redtrasex.org/-Sobre-Nosotras-|archivedate=2017-12-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reynaga co-edited  ''Un Movimiento de Tacones Altos'' (The High Heels Movement) a manual for the defense of sex workers' rights published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.redtrasex.org/IMG/pdf/armado-manual.pdf|title=El Movimiento de Tacones Altos|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608115936/https://www.redtrasex.org/IMG/pdf/armado-manual.pdf|archivedate=2018-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Buenos Aires legislature recognised Reynaga as "Outstanding Public Figure for the Human Rights of Women" (in Spanish “Personalidad Destacada de los Derechos Humanos de las Mujeres”).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/sociedad/3-132708-2009-10-01.html|title=Página/12 :: Sociedad :: Una distinción para Elena Reynaga|website=www.pagina12.com.ar|language=es|access-date=2018-05-29|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124031410/http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/sociedad/3-132708-2009-10-01.html|archivedate=2010-01-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 she was recognised by the Argentinian Senate for her human rights work and leadership against discrimination and stigma, as well as the reclamation of female sex workers as workers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cta.org.ar/elena-reynaga-fue-galardonada-por.html?rubrique5|title=Elena Reynaga fue galardonada por el Senado de la Nación Argentina|website=Central de Trabajadores de la Argentina|access-date=2018-06-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608115936/http://www.cta.org.ar/elena-reynaga-fue-galardonada-por.html?rubrique5|archivedate=2018-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cta.org.ar/elena-reynaga-fue-galardonada-por.html?rubrique5|title=Elena Reynaga fue galardonada por el Senado de la Nación Argentina|website=Central de Trabajadores de la Argentina|access-date=2018-05-29|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608115936/http://www.cta.org.ar/elena-reynaga-fue-galardonada-por.html?rubrique5|archivedate=2018-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 she was elected onto a UN advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/democraciaabierta/piers-purdy-and-natalia-umansky-with-elena-reynaga/if-i-were-born-again-i-would-st|title="If I were born again, I would still be a sex worker"|date=2016-10-25|website=openDemocracy|language=en|access-date=2018-06-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226065641/https://www.opendemocracy.net/democraciaabierta/piers-purdy-and-natalia-umansky-with-elena-reynaga/if-i-were-born-again-i-would-st|archivedate=2017-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ethnic conflict''' is a conflict between two or more contending [[ethnic group]]s.  While the source of the conflict may be [[political]], social, economic or religious, the individuals in conflict must expressly fight for their ethnic group's position within society. This final criterion differentiates ethnic conflict from other forms of struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethnic Conflict and Civic Life : Hindus and Muslims in India|last=Varshney|first=Ashutosh|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic politics of ethnic war|last=Kaufman|first=Stuart J.|publisher=Cornell University. Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Ithaca|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic conflict does not necessarily have to be [[Violence|violent]]. In a multi-ethnic society where freedom of speech is protected, ethnic conflict can be an everyday feature of plural democracies. For example, ethnic conflict might be a non-violent struggle for resources divided among ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dynamics of Ethnic Competition and Conflict|last=Olzak|first=Susan|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=Stanford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the subject of the confrontation must be either directly or symbolically linked with an ethnic group. In healthy multi-ethnic democracies, these conflicts are usually institutionalized and "channeled through parliaments, assemblies and bureaucracies or through non-violent demonstrations and strikes."&lt;ref name="Varshney2007"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ashutoshvarshney.net/wp-content/files_mf/varshneyethnicityandethnicconflict.pdf|title=Ethnicity and Ethnic Conflict|last=Varshney|first=Ashutosh|date=2007|website=|publisher=Oxford handbook of comparative politics|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While democratic countries cannot always prevent ethnic conflict flaring up into violence, institutionalized ethnic conflict does ensure that ethnic groups can articulate their demands in a peaceful manner, which reduces the likelihood of violence. On the other hand, in authoritarian systems, ethnic minorities are often unable to express their grievances. Grievances are instead allowed to fester which might lead to long phases of ethnic silence followed by a violent outburst.&lt;ref name="Varshney2007" /&gt; Therefore, ethnic peace is an absence of violence, not an absence of conflict. Another consequence is that violent ethnic rebellions often result in political rights for previously marginalized groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koos|first=Carlo|date=2016-02-01|title=Does violence pay? The effect of ethnic rebellion on overcoming political deprivation|url=http://cmp.sagepub.com/content/33/1/3|journal=Conflict Management and Peace Science|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=3–24|doi=10.1177/0738894214559670|issn=0738-8942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic explanations of ethnic conflict generally fall into one of three schools of thought: [[primordialism|primordialist]], [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] or [[social constructivism|constructivist]]. Recently, several political scientists have argued for either top-down or bottom-up explanations for ethnic conflict. Intellectual debate has also focused on whether ethnic conflict has become more prevalent since the end of the [[Cold War]], and on devising ways of managing conflicts, through instruments such as [[consociationalism]] and [[Federalism|federalisation]].

==Theories of causes==
The causes of ethnic conflict are debated by [[political scientists]] and [[sociologists]]. Explanations generally fall into one of three schools of thought: primordialist, instrumentalist, and constructivist. More recent scholarship draws on all three schools.{{year needed|date=August 2013}}{{who|date=August 2013}}

===Primordialist accounts===
Proponents of primordialist accounts argue that "[e]thnic groups and nationalities exist because there are traditions of belief and action towards primordial objects such as biological features and especially territorial location".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Steven|last=Grosby|year=1994|title=The verdict of history: The inexpungeable tie of primordiality&amp;nbsp;– a response to Eller and Coughlan|journal=[[Ethnic and Racial Studies]]|volume=17|issue=1|pages=164–171 [p. 168]|doi=10.1080/01419870.1994.9993817}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primordialist accounts rely on strong ties of kinship among members of ethnic groups. [[Donald L. Horowitz]] argues that this kinship "makes it possible for ethnic groups to think in terms of family resemblances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald L.|last=Horowitz|year=1985|title=Ethnic Groups in Conflict|location=Berkeley, CA|publisher=University of California Press|page=57|isbn=0520053850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clifford Geertz]], a founding scholar of primordialism, asserts that each person has a natural connection to perceived kinsmen. In time and through repeated conflict, essential ties to one's ethnicity will coalesce and will interfere with ties to civil society. Ethnic groups will consequently always threaten the survival of civil governments but not the existence of nations formed by one ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Old societies and new States; the quest for modernity in Asia and Africa.|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|publisher=Free Press of Glencoe|year=1963|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when considered through a primordial lens, ethnic conflict in multi-ethnic society is inevitable.

A number of political scientists argue that the root causes of ethnic conflict do not involve ethnicity ''per se'' but rather institutional, political, and economic factors.  These scholars argue that the concept of ethnic war is misleading because it leads to an [[essentialism|essentialist]] conclusion that certain groups are doomed to fight each other when in fact the wars between them that occur are often the result of political decisions.&lt;ref name="RefError"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Constructing Grievance: Ethnic Nationalism in Russia's Republics|last=Giuliano|first=Elise|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, primordial accounts  do not account for the spatial and temporal variations in ethnic violence. If these "ancient hatreds" are always simmering under the surface and are at the forefront of people's consciousness, then ethnic groups should constantly be ensnared in violence. However, ethnic violence occurs in sporadic outbursts. For example, Varshney points out that although Yugoslavia broke up due to ethnic violence in the 1990s, it had enjoyed a long peace of decades before the USSR collapsed. Therefore, some scholars claim that it is unlikely that primordial ethnic differences alone caused the outbreak of violence in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="RefError"/&gt;

Primordialists have reformulated the "ancient hatreds" hypothesis and have focused more on the role of human nature. Peterson argues that the existence of hatred and animosity does not have to be rooted in history for it to play a role in shaping human behavior and action: "If "ancient hatred" means a hatred consuming the daily thoughts of great masses of people, then the "ancient hatreds" argument deserves to be readily dismissed. However, if hatred is conceived as a historically formed "schema" that guides action in some situations, then the conception should be taken more seriously."&lt;ref name="Varshney2007" /&gt;

===Instrumentalist accounts===
[[Anthony D. Smith|Anthony Smith]] notes that the instrumentalist account "came to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s in the United States, in the debate about (white) ethnic persistence in what was supposed to have been an effective melting pot".&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony|last=Smith|year=2001|title=Nationalism: Theory, Ideology, History|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity|pages=54–55|isbn=0745626580}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new theory sought explained persistence as the result of the actions of community leaders, "who used their cultural groups as sites of mass mobilization and as constituencies in their competition for power and resources, because they found them more effective than social classes".&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; In this account of ethnic identification, ethnicity and race are viewed as instrumental means to achieve particular ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen|last=Cornell|first2=Douglas|last2=Hartmann|year=1998|title=Ethnicity and Race: Making Identities in a Changing World|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|publisher=Pine Forge|page=59|isbn=0761985018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] is a fixed perception or not is not crucial in the instrumentalist accounts. Moreover, the scholars of this school generally do not oppose the view that ethnic difference plays a part in many conflicts. They simply claim that ethnic difference is not sufficient to explain conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schlichting|first=Ursel|chapter=Conflict Between Different Nationalities: Chances for and Limits to Their Settlement|editor1-first=Andreas|editor1-last=Klinke|editor2-first=Ortwin|editor2-last=Renn|editor3-link=Jean Paul Lehners|editor3-first=Jean Paul|editor3-last=Lehners|title=Ethnic Conflicts and Civil Society|location=Aldershot|publisher=Ashgate|year=1997|isbn=1840144556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Handbook/Articles/smith_handbook.pdf|last=Smith|first=Dan|year=2003|chapter=Trends and Causes of Armed Conflicts|editor1-first=Alexander|editor1-last=Austin|editor2-first=Martina|editor2-last=Fischer|editor3-first=Norbert|editor3-last=Ropers|title=Berghof Handbook for Conflict Transformation|location=Berlin|publisher=Berghof Research Centre for Constructive Conflict Management/Berghof Foundation|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass mobilization of ethnic groups can only be successful if there are latent ethnic differences to be exploited, otherwise politicians would not even attempt to make political appeals based on ethnicity and would focus instead on economic or ideological appeals. Hence, it is difficult to completely discount the role of inherent ethnic differences. Additionally, ethnic entrepreneurs, or elites, could be tempted to mobilize ethnic groups in order to gain their political support in democratizing states.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Voting to Violence: Democratization and Nationalist Conflict|last=Snyder|first=Jack|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instrumentalists theorists especially emphasize this interpretation in ethnic states in which one ethnic group is promoted at the expense of other ethnicities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Can Liberalism Be Exported?|last=Kymlicka|first=Wil|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, ethnic mass mobilization is likely to be plagued by collective action problems, especially if ethnic protests are likely to lead to violence. Instrumentalist scholars have tried to respond to these shortcomings. For example, Hardin{{Who|date=August 2017}} argues that ethnic mobilization faces problems of coordination and not collective action. He points out that a charismatic leader acts as a focal point around which members of an ethnic group coalesce. The existence of such an actor helps to clarify beliefs about the behavior of others within an ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=bCcEJte1irEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=Peace+Studies:+Critical+Concepts+in+Political+Science,+Volume+3+By+Matthew+Evangelista&amp;ots=pXiCfd_4X9&amp;sig=0DzZtwPvp5Mo1NSjnA5zfr-onEk#v=onepage&amp;q=Peace%20Studies%3A%20Critical%20Concepts%20in%20Political%20Science%2C%20Volume%203%20By%20Matthew%20Evangelista&amp;f=false|title=Peace studies: Critical concepts in political science.|last=Evangelista|first=Matthew|date=2005|website=|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructivist accounts===
A third, constructivist, set of accounts stress the importance of the socially constructed nature of ethnic groups, drawing on [[Benedict Anderson]]'s concept of the [[imagined community]]. Proponents of this account point to [[Rwanda]] as an example because  the [[Tutsi]]/[[Hutu]] distinction was codified by the [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian colonial power]] in the 1930s on the basis of cattle ownership, physical measurements and church records. Identity cards were issued on this basis, and these documents played a key role in the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]] of 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mahmood|last=Mamdani|year=2001|title=When Victims Become Killers: Colonialism, Nativism, and the Genocide in Rwanda|location=Princeton, NJ|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691058210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that constructivist narratives of historical master cleavages are unable to account for local and regional variations in ethnic violence. For example, Varshney highlights that in the 1960s "racial violence in the USA was heavily concentrated in northern cities; southern cities though intensely politically engaged, did not have riots".&lt;ref name="Varshney2007" /&gt; A constructivist master narrative is often a country level variable whereas we often have to study incidences of ethnic violence at the regional and local level.

Scholars of ethnic conflict and [[civil war]]s have introduced theories that draw insights from all three traditional schools of thought. In ''The Geography of Ethnic Violence'', for example, Monica Duffy Toft shows how ethnic group settlement patterns, socially constructed identities, charismatic leaders, issue indivisibility, and state concern with precedent setting can lead rational actors to escalate a dispute to violence, even when doing so is likely to leave contending groups much worse off.&lt;ref name="Toft"&gt;{{cite book |first=Monica Duffy|last=Toft|year=2003|title=The Geography of Ethnic Violence: Identity, Interests, and the Indivisibility of Territory|location=Princeton, NJ|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691113548}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such research addresses empirical puzzles that are difficult to explain using primordialist, instrumentalist, or constructivist approaches alone. As Varshney notes, "pure essentialists and pure instrumentalists do not exist anymore".&lt;ref name="Varshney2007" /&gt;

== Study in the post-Cold War world ==
The end of the Cold War thus sparked interest in two important questions about ethnic conflict: whether ethnic conflict was on the rise and whether given that some ethnic conflicts had escalated into serious violence, what, if anything, could scholars of large-scale violence (security studies, strategic studies, interstate politics) offer by way of explanation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

One of the most debated issues relating to ethnic conflict is whether it has become more or less prevalent in the post–Cold War period. At the end of the Cold War, academics including [[Samuel P. Huntington]] and [[Robert D. Kaplan]] predicted a proliferation of conflicts fueled by [[Clash of Civilizations|civilisational clashes]], [[Tribalism]], [[Natural resource|resource]] [[scarcity]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Samuel P. |last=Huntington |year=1993 |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html |title=The clash of civilizations? |journal=[[Foreign Affairs]] |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=22–49 |doi=10.2307/20045621 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629022856/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html |archivedate=2007-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert D.|last=Kaplan|year=1994|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideastour/archive/kaplan.mhtml|title=The coming anarchy|journal=[[The Atlantic Monthly]]|volume=273|issue=2|pages=44–76|access-date=2017-03-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724054203/http://www.theatlantic.com/ideastour/archive/kaplan.mhtml|archive-date=2008-07-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post–Cold War period has witnessed a number of ethnically-informed [[secessionist movements]], predominantly within the former communist states. Conflicts have involved secessionist movements in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]], [[Transnistria]] in [[Moldova]], [[Armenians]] in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]] and [[Ossetians]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Outside the former communist bloc, ethno-separatist strife in the same period has occurred in areas such as [[Sri Lanka]], [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]], [[Chiapas]], [[East Timor]], the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], [[Catalonia]], [[Southern Sudan]] and Hazaras in Afghanistan under the Taliban.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

However, some theorists contend that this does not represent a rise in the incidence of ethnic conflict, because many of the [[proxy wars]] fought during the Cold War as ethnic conflicts were actually  hot spots of the Cold War. Research shows that the fall of [[Communism]] and the increase in the number of capitalist states were accompanied by a decline in total warfare, interstate wars, [[ethnic]] wars, [[revolutionary]] wars, and the number of [[refugees]] and [[displaced person]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter|last=Wallensteen|first2=Margareta|last2=Sollenberg|year=1995|doi=10.1177/0022343395032003007|title=After the Cold War: Emerging patterns of armed conflict 1989–94|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=32|issue=3|pages=345–360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Lotta|last=Harbom|first2=Peter|last2=Wallensteen|year=2005|url=http://info.uu.se/press.nsf/166B1EC86A3FAF93C125706D0037D2E3/$File/JPRarticle.pdf|title=Armed conflict and its international dimensions, 1946–2004|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=42|issue=5|pages=623–635|doi=10.1177/0022343305056238|access-date=2007-02-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616093316/http://info.uu.se/press.nsf/166B1EC86A3FAF93C125706D0037D2E3/$File/JPRarticle.pdf|archive-date=2007-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.aol.com/CSPmgm/conflict.htm|title=Measuring systemic peace|publisher=Center for Systemic Peace|date=30 October 2006|accessdate=18 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, some scholars have questioned whether the concept of ethnic conflict is useful at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bruce|last=Gilley|year=2004|doi=10.1080/0143659042000256959|title=Against the concept of ethnic conflict|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=25|issue=6|pages=1155–1166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have attempted to test the "clash of civilisations" thesis, finding it to be difficult to operationalise and that civilisational conflicts have not risen in intensity in relation to other ethnic conflicts since the end of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jonathan|last=Fox|year=2002|doi=10.1017/S0007123402000170|title=Ethnic minorities and the Clash of Civilizations: A quantitative analysis of Huntington's thesis|journal=British Journal of Political Science|volume=32|issue=3|pages=415–434}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Giacomo|last=Chiozza|year=2002|jstor=1555255|title=Is there a Clash of Civilizations?

A key question facing scholars who attempt to adapt their theories of interstate violence to explain or predict large-scale ethnic violence is whether  ethnic groups could be considered "rational" actors.&lt;ref name="Kalyvas"&gt;{{cite book 
|first=Stathis N.|last=Kalyvas|year=2006|title=The Logic of Violence in Civil War|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521854091}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to the end of the Cold War, the consensus among students of large-scale violence was that ethnic groups should be considered irrational actors, or semi-rational at best. If true, general explanations of ethnic violence would be impossible. In the years since, however, scholarly consensus has shifted to consider that ethnic groups may in fact be counted as rational actors, and the puzzle of their apparently irrational actions (for example, fighting over territory of little or no intrinsic worth) must therefore be explained in some other way.&lt;ref name="Toft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalyvas" /&gt; As a result, the possibility of a general explanation of ethnic violence has grown, and collaboration between comparativist and international-relations sub-fields has resulted in increasingly useful theories of ethnic conflict.

== Public goods provision ==
A major source of ethnic conflict in multi-ethnic democracies is over the access to state patronage. Conflicts over state resources between ethnic groups can increase the likelihood of ethnic violence. In ethnically divided societies, demand for public goods decreases as each ethnic group derives more utility from benefits targeted at their ethnic group in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolev, Wang|first=|date=2010|title=Ethnic Group Divisions and Clientelism|ssrn=1644406|journal=APSA Annual Meeting Paper|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These benefits would be less valued if all other ethnic groups had access to them.Targeted benefits are more appealing because ethnic groups can solidify or heighten their social and economic status relative to other ethnic groups whereas broad programmatic policies will not improve their relative worth. Politicians and political parties in turn, have an incentive to favor co-ethnics in their distribution of material benefits. Over the long run, ethnic conflict over access to state benefits is likely to lead to the ethnification of political parties and the party system as a whole where the political salience of ethnic identity increase leading to a self-fulfilling equilibrium: If politicians only distribute benefits on an ethnic basis, voters will see themselves primarily belonging to an ethnic group and view politicians the same way. They will only vote for the politician belonging to the same ethnic group. In turn, politicians will refrain from providing public goods because it will not serve them well electorally to provide services to people not belonging to their ethnic group. In democratizing societies, this could lead to ethnic outbidding and lead to extreme politicians pushing out moderate co-ethnics.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Patronage politics and ethnic politics eventually reinforce each other, leading to what Chandra terms a "patronage democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://politics.as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/2587/Chandra2007-CountingHeads.pdf|title=Patrons, clients, and policies: Patterns of democratic accountability and political competition|last=Kitschelt|first=Herbert|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of patronage networks between local politicians and ethnic groups make it easier for politicians to mobilize ethnic groups and instigate ethnic violence for electoral gain since the neighborhood or city is already polarized along ethnic lines. The dependence of ethnic groups on their co-ethnic local politician for access to state resources is likely to make them more responsive to calls of violence against other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="Berenschot2010"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berenschot|first=Ward|date=2010|title=The Spatial Distribution of Riots: Patronage and the Instigation of Communal Violence in Gujarat, India|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0305750X10002019/1-s2.0-S0305750X10002019-main.pdf?_tid=6f3d0cfa-1365-11e6-820c-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1462523886_331783388|journal=World Development|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.029|access-date=|volume=39|pages=221–230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the existence of these local patronage channels generates incentives for ethnic groups to engage in politically motivated violence.&lt;ref name="Berenschot2010" /&gt;

While the link between ethnic heterogeneity and under provision of public goods is generally accepted, there is little consensus around the causal mechanism underlying this relationship. To identify possible causal stories, Humphreys and Habyarimana ran a serious of behavioral games in Kampala, Uganda that involved several local participants completing joint tasks and allocating money amongst them.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habyaimana|first=James|date=November 2007|title=Why does ethnic diversity undermine public goods provision?|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~mh2245/papers1/HHPW.pdf|journal=American Political Science Review|doi=10.1017/S0003055407070499|access-date=|volume=101|pages=709–725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the conventional wisdom, they find that participants did not favor the welfare of their co-ethnics disproportionately. It was only when anonymity was removed and everyone's ethnicity was known did co-ethnics decide to favor each other. Humphreys and Habyarimana argue that cooperation among co-ethnics is primarily driven by reciprocity norms that tend to be stronger among co-ethnics.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The possibility of social sanctions compelled those who would not otherwise cooperate with their co-ethnics to do so. The authors find no evidence to suggest that co-ethnics display a greater degree of altruism towards each other or have the same preferences. Ethnic cooperation takes place because co-ethnics have common social networks and therefore can monitor each other and can threaten to socially sanction any transgressors.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Institutional ethnic conflict resolution ==
A number of scholars have attempted to synthesize the methods available for the [[conflict resolution|resolution]], [[conflict management|management]] or [[conflict transformation|transformation]] of their ethnic conflict. [[John Coakley]], for example, has developed a [[wiktionary:Typology|typology]] of the methods of conflict resolution that have been employed by states, which he lists as: [[indigenization]], accommodation, [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[acculturation]], [[population transfer]], boundary alteration, [[genocide]] and ethnic suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coakley | first1 = John | year = 1992 | title = The resolution of ethnic conflict: Towards a typology | url = http://ips.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/13/4/343 | journal = International Political Science Review | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 343–358 | doi=10.1177/019251219201300401}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McGarry]] and [[Brendan O'Leary]] have developed a taxonomy of eight macro-political ethnic conflict regulation methods, which they note are often employed by states in combination with each other.&lt;ref&gt;John McGarry and Brendan O’Leary (1993) 'Introduction: The macro-political regulation of ethnic conflict’, in John McGarry and Brendan O’Leary (eds.) ''The Politics of Ethnic Conflict Regulation: Case Studies of Protracted Ethnic Conflicts'', London: Routledge, pp. 1-40&lt;/ref&gt; They include a number of methods that they note are clearly morally unacceptable.

With increasing interest in the field of ethnic conflict, many policy analysts and political scientists theorized potential resolutions and tracked the results of institutional policy implementation. As such, theories often focus on which [[Institutions]] are the most appropriate for addressing ethnic conflict.

=== Consociationalism ===
Consociationalism is a [[power sharing]] agreement which coopts the leaders of ethnic groups into the central state's government. Each nation or ethnic group is represented in the government through a supposed spokesman for the group. In the power sharing agreement, each group has veto powers to varying degrees, dependent on the particular state. Moreover, the norm of proportional representation is dominant: each group is represented in the government in a percentage that reflects the ethnicity's demographic presence in the state.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Containing Nationalism|last=Hechter|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another requirement for [[Arend Lijphart]] is that the government must be composed of a "grand coalition" of the ethnic group leaders which supposes a top-down approach to conflict resolution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stroschein|first=Sherrill|date=November 2014|title=Consociational Settlements and Reconstruction: Bosnia in Comparative Perspective (1995- Present)|url=|journal=Annals of the American Academy|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, this leads to self governance and protection for the ethnic group. Many scholars&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nationalism Reframed|last=Brubaker|first=Roger|publisher=Cambridge|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Stuart|date=Fall 1996|title=Spiraling to Ethnic War: Elites, Masses, and Moscow in Moldova's Civil War|url=|journal=International Security|doi=10.1162/isec.21.2.108|volume=21|pages=108–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintain that since ethnic tension erupts into ethnic violence when the ethnic group is threatened by a state, then veto powers should allow the ethnic group to avoid legislative threats. Switzerland is often characterized as a successful consociationalist state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A recent example of a consociational government is the post-conflict [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian government]] that was agreed upon in the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]] in 1995. A tripartite presidency was chosen and must have a Croat, a Serb, and a Bosniak. The presidents take turns acting as the forefront executive in terms of 8 months for 4 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many have credited this compromise of a consociational government in Bosnia for the end of the violence and the following long-lasting peace.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In contrast to Lijphart, several political scientists and policy analysts have condemned consociationalism.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=Lisa Morje|date=October 2012|title=The Ethnocracy Trap|url=|journal=Journal of Democracy|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reconstructing Multiethnic Societies: The Case of Bosnia-Hercegovina|last=Bieber|first=Florian|publisher=Ashgate Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=109–121|chapter=Challenge of Democracy in Divided Societies: Lessons from Bosnia-- Challenges for Kosovo}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the many critiques is that consociationalism locks in ethnic tensions and identities. This assumes a primordial stance that ethnic identities are permanent and not subject to change.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Furthermore, this does not allow for any "others" that might want to partake in the political process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  As of 2012 a Jewish Bosnian is suing the Bosnian government from precluding him from running for presidential office since only a Croat, Serb, or Bosniak can run under the consociational government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guss|first=Jason|last2=Siroky|first2=David S.|date=2012|title=Living with Heterogeneity: Bridging the Ethnic Divide in Bosnia|url=|journal=Comparative Sociology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining ethnic identities in advance and implementing a power sharing system on the basis of these fixed identities is inherently discriminatory against minority groups that might be not be recognized.&lt;ref name="RefError"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lijphart|first=Arend|date=Winter 2001|title=Constructivism and Consociational Theory|url=http://comparativenewsletter.com/files/archived_newsletters/2001_winter.pdf|journal=Newsletter of the Organized Section in Comparative Politics of the American Political Science Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it discriminates against those who do not choose to define their identity on an ethnic or communal basis. In power sharing-systems that are based on pre-determined identities, there is a tendency to rigidly fix shares of representation on a permanent basis which will not reflect changing demographics over time.&lt;ref name="RefError"/&gt; The categorization of individuals in particular ethnic groups might be controversial anyway and might in fact fuel ethnic tensions.

The inherent weaknesses in using pre-determined ethnic identities to form power sharing systems has led Ljiphart to argue that adopting a constructivist approach to consociationalism can increase its likelihood of success.&lt;ref name="RefError"/&gt; The self-determination of ethnic identities is more likely to be "non-discriminatory, neutral, flexible and self-adjusting."&lt;ref name="RefError"/&gt; For example, in South Africa, the toxic legacy of apartheid meant that successful consociation could only be built on the basis of the self-determination of groups. Ljiphart claims that because ethnic identities are often "unclear, fluid and flexible,"&lt;ref name="RefError"/&gt; self-determination is likely to be more successful than pre-determination of ethnic groups.  A constructivist approach to consociational theory can therefore strengthen its value as a method to resolve ethnic conflict.

Another critique points to the privileging of ethnic identity over personal political choice.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Howard has deemed consociationalism as a form of ethnocracy and not a path to true pluralistic democracy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Consociationalism assumes that a politician will best represent the will of his co-ethnics above other political parties. This might lead to the polarization of ethnic groups and the loss of non-ethnic ideological parties.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stroschein|first=Sherill|date=December 2008|title=Making or Breaking Kosovo: Applications of Dispersed State Control|url=|journal=Perspectives on Politics|doi=10.1017/s153759270808184x|pmid=|access-date=|volume=6|page=655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horowitz has argued that a single transferable vote system could prevent the ethnification of political parties because voters cast their ballots in order of preference.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Democratic South Africa? Constitutional Engineering in a Divided Society|last=Horowitz|first=Donald|publisher=University of California Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=167–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a voter could cast some of his votes to parties other than his co-ethnic party.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; This in turn would compel political parties to broaden their manifestos to appeal to voters across the ethnic divide to hoover up second and third preference votes.

=== Federalism ===
The theory of implementing federalism in order to curtail ethnic conflict assumes that self-governance reduces "demands for sovereignty".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hechter argues that some goods such as language of education and bureaucracy must be provided as local goods, instead of statewide, in order to satisfy more people and ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some political scientists such as Stroschein contend that [[ethnic federalism|ethnofederalism]], or federalism determined along ethnic lines, is "asymmetric" as opposed to the equal devolution of power found in non-ethnic federal states, such as the United States. In this sense, special privileges are granted to specific minority groups as concessions and incentives to end violence or mute conflict.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] divided its structure into ethno-federal sub-states termed [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Union Republics]]. The sub-state was named after a titular minority who inhabited the area as a way to Sovietize nationalist sentiments during the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Revenge of the Past Nationalism, Revolution, and the Collapse of the Soviet Union|last=Suny|first=Ronald|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brubaker asserts that these titular republics were formed in order to absorb any potential elite led nationalist movements against the Soviet center by incentivizing elite loyalty through advancement in the Soviet political structure.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Thus, federalism provides some self-governance for local matters in order to satisfy some of the grievances which might cause ethnic conflict among the masses. Moreover, federalism brings in the elites and ethnic entrepreneurs into the central power structure; this prevents a resurgence of top-down ethnic conflict.

Nevertheless, after the fall of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] many critiques of federalism as an institution to resolve ethnic conflict emerged. The devolution of power away from the central state can weaken ties to the central state.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Moreover, the parallel institutions created to serve a particular nation or ethnic group might provide significant resources for [[Secession]] from the central state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bunce|first=Valerie|date=1998|title=Subversive Institutions: The End of Soviet State in Comparative Perspective|url=|journal=Post-Soviet Affairs|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Derluguian|first=Georgi M.|date=1999|title=Ethnofederalism and Ethnonationalism: The Separatist politics of Chechnya and Tatarstan: Sources or Resources?|url=|journal=International Journal of Public Administration|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As most states are unwilling to give up an integral portion of their territory, secessionist movements may trigger violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rights of Minority Cultures|last=Buchanan|first=Allen|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=|editor-last=Kymlicka|editor-first=Will|location=|pages=|chapter=Morality of Secession}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some competing elite political players may not be in power; they would remain unincorporated into the central system. These competing elites can gain access through federal structures and their resources to solidify their political power in the structure.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to V.P. Gagnon this was the case in the former [[Yugoslavia]] and its violent disintegration into its ethno-federal sub-states. Ethnic entrepreneurs were able to take control of the institutionally allocated resources to wage war on other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="RefError2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Myth of Ethnic War: Serbia and Croatia in the 1990s|last=Gagnon|first=V.P.|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100628500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-territorial autonomy ===
A recent theory of ethnic tension resolution is non-territorial autonomy or NTA. NTA has emerged in recent years as an alternative solution to ethnic tensions and grievances in places that are likely to breed conflict.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osipov|first=Alexander|date=2013|title=Non-Territorial Autonomy during and after Communism: In the Wrong or Right Place?|url=|journal=Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, NTA has been promoted as a more practical and state building solution than consociationalism.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; NTA, alternatively known as non-cultural autonomy (NCA), is based on the difference of ''[[jus soli]]s'' and ''jus sanguinis,'' the principles of territory versus that of personhood.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coakley|first=John|date=1994|title=Approaches to the Resolution of Ethnic Conflict: The Strategy of Non-territorial Autonomy|url=|journal=International Political Science Review|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives rights to ethnic groups to self-rule and govern matters potentially concerning but limited to: education, language, culture, internal affairs, religion, and the internally established institutions needed to promote and reproduce these facets.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stefanwolff.com/files/ConsociationalTheoryPaper.pdf|title=A Consociational Theory of Conflict Management|last=Wolff|first=Stefan|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to federalism, the ethnic groups are not assigned a titular sub-state, but rather the ethnic groups are dispersed throughout the state unit. Their group rights and autonomy are not constrained to a particular territory within the state. This is done in order not to weaken the center state such as in the case of ethnofederalism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The origin of NTA can be traced back to the Marxists works of [[Otto Bauer]] and [[Karl Renner]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Challenge of Non-Territorial Autonomy: Theory and Practice|last=Smith|first=David J.|publisher=Peter Lang|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Challenges of Non-Territorial Autonomy in Contemporary Central and Eastern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; NTA was employed during the interwar period, and the League of Nations sought to add protection clauses for national minorities in new states.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In the 1920s, [[Estonia]] granted some cultural autonomy to the German and Jewish populations in order to ease conflicts between the groups and the newly independent state.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In Europe, most notably in [[Belgium]], NTA laws have been enacted and created parallel institutions and political parties in the same country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalle Mulle|first=Emmanuel|date=2016|title=Belgium and the Brussels Question: The Role of Non-Territorial Autonomy|url=|journal=Ethnopolitics|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Belgium, NTA has been integrated within the federal consociational system.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Some scholars of ethnic conflict resolution claim that the practice of NTA will be employed dependent on the concentration and size of the ethnic group asking for group rights.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Other scholars, such as Clarke, argue that the successful implementation of NTA rests on the acknowledgement in a state of "universal" principles: true [[Rule of law|Rule of Law]], established [[human rights]], stated guarantees to minorities and their members to use their own quotidien language, religion, and food practices, and a framework of anti-discrimination legislation in order to enforce these rights.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Challenge of Non-Territorial Autonomy|last=Clarke|first=Charles|publisher=Peter Lang|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Preface: Using the Ideas of 'Non-Territorial Autonomy' to Avoid Violent Conflict and Meet the Modern Challenges of Nationalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, no individual can be forced to adhere, identify, or emphasize a particular identity (such as race, gender, sexuality, etc.) without their consent in order for NTA to function for its purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Identity and Violence: The Illusion of Destiny|last=Sen|first=Amartya|publisher=Penguin|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Clarke critiques the weaknesses of NTA in areas such as education, a balance between society wide norms and intracommunity values; policing, for criminal matters and public safety; and political representation, which limits the political choices of an individual if based solely on ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Furthermore, the challenge in evaluating the efficacy of NTA lies in the relatively few legal implementations of NTA.

===Cultural rights===
Emphasizing the limits of approaches that focus mainly on institutional answers to ethnic conflicts—which are essentially driven by ethnocultural dynamics of which political and/or economic factors are but elements—Gregory Paul Meyjes urges the use of intercultural communication and cultural-rights based negotiations as tools with which to effectively and sustainably address inter-ethnic strife. Meyjes argues that to fully grasp, preempt, and/or resolve such conflicts—whether with or without the aid of territorial or non-territorial institutional mechanism(s) -- a [[cultural rights]] approach grounded in intercultural knowledge and skill is essential.&lt;ref&gt;Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes), Gregory Paul (2012) 'Multi-Ethnic Conflicts in U.S. Military Theatres Overseas: Intercultural Imperatives', in Volker Franke and Robert H. "Robin" Dorff (eds.) ''Conflict Management: A Tool for U.S. National Security Strategy'', Carlisle, PA: Strategic Studies Institute, U.S. Army War College, pp. 381-438&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes), Gregory Paul (2007) 'Plan "C" is for Culture: out of Iraq – Opportunity,' Landpower Essay 07-4, May 2007, Arlington, VA: Association of the United States Army.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethnic conflict resolution outside formal institutions ==

=== Informal inter-ethnic engagement ===
Institutionalist arguments for resolving ethnic conflict often focus on national-level institutions and do not account for regional and local variation in ethnic violence within a country. Despite similar levels of ethnic diversity in a country, some towns and cities have often found to be especially prone to ethnic violence. For example, Ashutosh Varshney, in his study of ethnic violence in [[India]], argues that strong inter-ethnic engagement in villages often disincentivizes politicians from stoking ethnic violence for electoral gain.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Varshney|first=Ashutosh|date=April 2001|title=Ethnic Conflict and Civil Society: India and Beyond|url=http://www.cridaq.uqam.ca/IMG/pdf/varshney_civil_society_copy_1_Jacques_Bertrand.pdf|journal=World Politics|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal interactions include joint participation in festivals, families from different communities eating together or allowing their children to play with one another.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Varshney|first=Ashutosh|date=April 2001|title=Ethnic Conflict and Civil Society: India and Beyond|url=http://www.cridaq.uqam.ca/IMG/pdf/varshney_civil_society_copy_1_Jacques_Bertrand.pdf|journal=World Politics|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every day engagement between ethnic groups at the village level can help to sustain the peace in the face of  national level shocks like an ethnic riot in another part of the country.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; In times of ethnic tension, these communities can quell rumors, police neighborhoods and come together to resist any attempts by politicians to polarize the community.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The stronger the inter-ethnic networks are, the harder it is for politicians to polarize the community even if it may be in their political interest to do so.

=== Formal inter-ethnic associations ===
However, in cities, where the population tends to be much higher, informal interactions between ethnic groups might not be sufficient to prevent violence. This is because many more links are needed to connect everyone, and therefore it is much more difficult to form and strengthen inter-ethnic ties.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; In cities, formal inter-ethnic associations like trade unions, business associations and professional organizations are more effective in encouraging inter-ethnic interactions that could prevent ethnic violence in the future.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; These organizations force ethnic groups to come together based on shared economic interests that overcomes any pre-existing ethnic differences. For example, inter-ethnic business organizations serve to connect the business interests of different ethnic groups which would increase their desire to maintain ethnic harmony. Any ethnic tension or outbreak of violence will go against their economic interests and therefore, over time, the salience of ethnic identity diminishes.

Interactions between ethnic groups in formal settings can also help countries torn apart by ethnic violence to recover and break down ethnic divisions. Paula Pickering, a political scientist, who studies peace-building efforts in Bosnia, finds that formal workplaces are often the site where inter-ethnic ties are formed.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pickering|first=Paula|date=January 2006|title=Generating social capital for bridging ethnic divisions in the Balkans: Case studies of two Bosniak cities|url=http://people.wm.edu/~pmpick/research/EthnicRacialStudiesPickering.pdf|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|doi=10.1080/01419870500352397|pmid=|access-date=|volume=29|pages=79–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that mixed workplaces lead to repeated inter-ethnic interaction where norms of professionalism compel everyone to cooperate and to treat each other with respect, making it easier for individuals belonging to the minority group to reach out and form relationships with everyone else.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Nevertheless, Giuliano's research in Russia has shown that economic grievances, even in a mixed workplace, can be politicized on ethnic lines.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

[[Category:Wars by type]]

&lt;!--for some reason we have a category called "Ethnic conflict" and another called"Ethnic conflicts". The reason is presumably the polysemy of the term "conflict", the former is indending the wider sense of 'conflict' as any clash of interests, the second is using it in the sense of "armed, open conflict". This should be fixed, the categories should be named more clearly --&gt;

Starting in the 18th century, ideas of aesthetic pleasure have tried to define "taste". [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[David Hume|Hume]] both argued that there was universal good taste, which made aesthetic pleasure. A feminist line of logic about these attempts is that, because [[fine art]] was a leisure activity at this time, those who could afford to make art or produce supposed universal truths about how it is enjoyed would do so in a way that creates class and sex division.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; Even when those universal aesthetists did address gender, they categorized aesthetics into two categories: [[beauty]] and [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]]; with beauty being small and delicate (feminine) and sublimity being large and awe-inspiring (masculine).&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; Feminist aesthetics analyzes why "feminine" traits are subservient compared to "masculine" traits in art and aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415266581|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation for the male-domination of forming aesthetic theory is that feminists express their aesthetic pleasure differently than non-feminist aesthetes for "whom the pleasure of theorizing [...] is a form of [[jouissance]]". Instead, a feminist is less likely to view the object as a disinterested interpreter, and intellectualize the sensation (Hilde Hein).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critics of feminist art argue that politics have no place in art, however, many art forms contain politics, but because of their subject position, the critics are unable to perceive it. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aesthetics in Feminist Perspective|last=Hein|first=Hilde|last2=Korsmeyer|first2=Carolyn|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=Bloomington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the ''creative genius'' is inspected in feminist aesthetics. In particular, women artists are often excluded from being creative or artistic geniuses.&lt;ref name=":0" group="encycl"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Genius and Feminism|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aesthetics|publisher=Oxford University Press|last=Battersby|first=Christine|date=1998|editor-last=Kelly|editor-first=Michael|isbn=9780195113075}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exclusion in part stems from the traditional masculine definitions of genius.&lt;ref name=":0" group="encycl" /&gt; Christine Battersby has critiqued the fact that women are excluded from being known as geniuses because female artists will be separated from their art, and instead their art will be called genius, instead of the artist.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, women were also excluded because they lacked the opportunities for artistic education required to be recognized as artists and geniuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=2004|isbn=9780203646632|series=Understanding Feminist Philosophy|location=London|pages=59|chapter=Amateurs and Professionals}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the idea of the creative genius itself celebrates individualism – which Christine Battersby calls "a kind of masculine heroism" – and overlooks the work of joint collaborations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender and Genius: Towards a Feminist Aesthetics|last = Battersby|first = Christine|publisher = The Women's Press Ltd.|year = 1989|isbn = 978-0704343009|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic theories that make a distinction between "arts" and "crafts" can be viewed as anti-feminist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Differencing the Canon: Feminism and the Writing of Art's Histories|last=Pollock|first=Griselda|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=9780415066990|location=New York|pages=25|chapter=Differencing: Feminism's encounter with the canon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, art usually refers to ''fine art'' and crafts refers to everything else which has ''[[Everyday Aesthetics|everyday aesthetics]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Art forms traditionally used by women, such as embroidery or sewing, are perceived as crafts and not art, because of their domestic uses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Feminist aesthetics focuses on all objects created by women, whether or not they are seen as "art".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since those craft practices occur in the home where many women continue to work, their creativity is overlooked by the perception of "art", because their domain is marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Extraordinary in the Ordinary: The aesthetics of everyday life|last = Leddy|first = Thomas|publisher = Broadview Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[optics]], '''Fermat's principle''' or the '''principle of least time''', named after French mathematician [[Pierre de Fermat]], is the principle that the path taken between two points by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time.  This principle is sometimes taken as the definition of a ray of light.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Schuster]], ''An Introduction to the Theory of Optics'', London: Edward Arnold, 1904 [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC03146755&amp;id=X0AcBd-bcCwC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=fermat%27s-principle online].&lt;/ref&gt; However, this version of the principle is not general; a more modern statement of the principle is that rays of light traverse the path of stationary optical length with respect to variations of the path.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a ray of light prefers the path such that there are other paths, arbitrarily nearby on either side, along which the ray would take almost exactly the same time to traverse.

Fermat's principle can be used to describe the properties of light rays [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] off mirrors, [[refraction|refracted]] through different media, or undergoing [[total internal reflection]]. It follows mathematically from [[Huygens' principle]] (at the limit of small [[wavelength]]). Fermat's text ''Analyse des réfractions'' exploits the technique of [[adequality]] to derive [[Snell's law]] of [[refraction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[law of reflection]].

Fermat's principle has the same form as [[Hamilton's principle]] and it is the basis of [[Hamiltonian optics]].

==Modern version==
The time T a point of the electromagnetic wave needs to cover a path between the points '''A''' and '''B''' is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;T=\int_{\mathbf{t_0}}^{\mathbf{t_1}} \, dt = \frac{1}{c} \int_{\mathbf{t_0}}^{\mathbf{t_1}} \frac{c}{v} \frac{ds}{dt}\, dt = \frac{1}{c} \int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n\, ds&lt;/math&gt;

''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, ''ds'' an infinitesimal displacement along the ray, ''v'' = ''ds''/''dt'' the speed of light in a medium and ''n'' = ''c''/''v'' the [[refractive index]] of that medium, &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the starting time (the wave front is in '''A'''), &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; is the arrival time at '''B'''. The optical path length of a ray from a point '''A''' to a point '''B''' is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;S=\int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n\, ds&lt;/math&gt;

and it is related to the travel time by ''S'' = ''cT''. The optical path length is a purely geometrical quantity since time is not considered in its calculation. An [[extremum]] in the light travel time between two points '''A''' and '''B''' is equivalent to an extremum of the optical path length between those two points. The historical form proposed by Fermat is incomplete. A complete modern statement of the variational Fermat principle is that {{quote|the optical length of the path followed by light between two fixed points, '''A''' and '''B''', is an extremum. The optical length is defined as the physical length multiplied by the refractive index of the material."&lt;ref&gt;R. Marques, F. Martin, and M. Sorolla. Metamaterials with Negative Parameters. Wiley, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the context of [[calculus of variations]] this can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta S= \delta\int_{\mathbf{A}}^{\mathbf{B}} n \, ds =0 &lt;/math&gt;

In general, the refractive index is a [[scalar field]] of position in space, that is, &lt;math&gt;n=n\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; in [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[euclidean space]]. Assuming now that light has a component that travels along the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; axis, the path of a light ray may be parametrized as &lt;math&gt;s=\left(x_1\left(x_3\right),x_2\left(x_3\right),x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;nds=n \frac{\sqrt{dx_1^2+dx_2^2+dx_3^2}}{dx_3}dx_3=n \sqrt{1+\dot{x}_1^2+\dot{x}_2^2} \ dx_3&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_k=dx_k/dx_3&lt;/math&gt;. The principle of Fermat can now be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\delta S= \delta\int_{x_{3A}}^{x_{3B}} n\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\right) \sqrt{1+\dot{x}_1^2+\dot{x}_2^2}\, dx_3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \delta\int_{x_{3A}}^{x_{3B}} L\left(x_1\left(x_3\right),x_2\left(x_3\right),\dot{x}_1\left(x_3\right),\dot{x}_2\left(x_3\right),x_3\right)\, dx_3=0&lt;/math&gt;

which has the same form as [[Hamilton's principle]] but in which ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; takes the role of time in [[classical mechanics]]. Function &lt;math&gt;L\left(x_1,x_2,\dot{x}_1,\dot{x}_2,x_3\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the optical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] from which the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian (as in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]) formulations of geometrical optics may be derived.&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] |  year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation==

Classically, Fermat's principle can be considered as a mathematical consequence of [[Huygens' principle]]. Indeed, of all secondary waves (along all possible paths) the waves with the extremal (stationary) paths contribute most due to constructive interference. Suppose that light waves propagate from A to B by all possible routes AB&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, unrestricted initially by rules of geometrical or physical optics. The various optical paths AB&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; will vary by amounts greatly in excess of one wavelength, and so the waves arriving at B will have a large range of phases and will tend to interfere destructively. But if there is a shortest route AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the optical path varies smoothly through it, then a considerable number of neighboring routes close to AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will have optical paths differing from AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; by second-order amounts only and will therefore interfere constructively. Waves along and close to this shortest route will thus dominate and AB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will be the route along which the light is seen to travel.&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Lipson, Stephen G. Lipson, Henry Lipson, ''Optical Physics 4th Edition'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-49345-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fermat's principle is the main principle of [[quantum electrodynamics]] which states that any particle (e.g. a photon or an electron) propagates over all available, unobstructed paths and that the interference, or superposition, of its wavefunction over all those paths at the point of observation gives the probability of detecting the particle at this point. Thus, because the extremal paths (shortest, longest, or stationary) cannot be completely canceled out, they contribute most to this interference. In humans, for example, Fermat's principle can be demonstrated in a situation when a lifeguard has to find the fastest way to traverse both beach and water in order to reach a drowning swimmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nautil.us/blog/to-save-drowning-people-ask-yourself-what-would-light-do | title=To Save Drowning People, Ask Yourself "What Would Light Do?" | author=Aatish Bhatia | date=24 March 2014 | publisher=Nautilus | access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle has been tested in studies with ants, in which the ants' nest is on one end of a container and food is on the opposite end, but the ants choose to follow the path of least time, rather than the most direct path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://phys.org/news/2013-04-ants-fermat-principle.html | title=Ants follow Fermat's principle of least time | author=Lisa Zyga | date=1 April 2013 | publisher=Phys.org | access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[classic mechanics]] of [[wave]]s, Fermat's principle follows from the [[extremum principle of mechanics]] (see [[variational principle]]).

==History==
[[Euclid]], c. 320 BCE in his [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics%201/EuclidCatoptrics.1.html Catoptrics] (on [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics.19/Catoptrics.19.html mirrors], including [http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/hmendel/Ancient%20Mathematics/Euclid/Catoptrics/Catoptrics.30/Catoptrics.30.html spherical mirrors]) and Optics, laid the foundations for reflection, which was repeated by [[Ptolemy]], and then in his more detailed books that have surfaced, [[Hero of Alexandria]] (Heron) (c. 60) described the principle of reflection, which stated that a ray of light that goes from point A to point B, suffering any number of reflections on flat mirrors in the same medium, has a smaller path length than any nearby path.&lt;ref&gt;History of Geometric Optics/Richard Fitzpatrick&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen), in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021), expanded the principle to both reflection and refraction, and expressed an early version of the principle of least time. His experiments were based on earlier works on refraction carried out by the Greek scientist [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;Pavlos Mihas (2005). [http://www.ihpst2005.leeds.ac.uk/papers/Mihas.pdf Use of History in Developing ideas of refraction, lenses and rainbow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032208/http://www.ihpst2005.leeds.ac.uk/papers/Mihas.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}, Demokritus University, Thrace, Greece.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pierre de Fermat2.png|thumb|140px|Pierre de Fermat]]
The generalized principle of least time in its modern form was stated by Fermat in a letter dated January 1, 1662, to [[Cureau de la Chambre]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Sean Mahoney]], ''The Mathematical Career of Pierre de Fermat, 1601-1665'', 2nd edition (Princeton University Press, 1994), p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; It was met with objections by [[Claude Clerselier]] in May 1662, an expert in optics and leading spokesman for the Cartesians at the time. Amongst his objections, Clerselier states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''... The principle which you take as the basis for your proof, namely that Nature always acts by using the simplest and shortest paths, is merely a moral, and not a physical one.  It is not, and cannot be, the cause of any effect in Nature.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The original French, from Mahoney, is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Le principe que vous prenez pour fondement de votre démonstration, à savoir que la nature agit toujours par les voies les plus courtes et les plus simples, n’est qu’un principe moral et non point physique, qui n’est point et qui ne peut être la cause d’aucun effet de la nature.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Fermat's principle does not hold standing alone, we now know it can be derived from earlier principles such as [[Huygens' principle]].

Historically, Fermat's principle has served as a guiding principle in the formulation of physical laws with the use of variational calculus (see [[Principle of least action]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15798">The '''Fishman Affidavit''' is a set of court documents submitted by ex-Scientologist [[Steven Fishman]] in 1993 in the federal case, ''Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz'' (Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx) [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]]).

The [[affidavit]] contained criticisms of the [[Church of Scientology]] and substantial portions of the [[Operating Thetan]] [[auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] and course materials.

==Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz==
The documents were brought as exhibits attached to a declaration by Steven Fishman on 9 April 1993 as part of ''Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz''. Along with [[Kendrick Moxon]] and Laurie Bartilson, [[Tim Bowles|Timothy Bowles]] was one of the lead attorneys for the Church of Scientology in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Fishman told the court that he had committed crimes on behalf of the Church. He also attested that he was assigned to [[murder]] his psychologist, Dr. Uwe Geertz, and then commit [[suicide]].&lt;ref name="greed"&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Behar |authorlink=Richard Behar |title=The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972865-1,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher= |id= |date=1991-05-06 |accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doublecrossed"&gt;{{cite web | first = Tony | last = Ortega | title = Double Crossed | url = http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-12-23/news/double-crossed/full | work = [[Phoenix New Times]] | publisher = [[Village Voice Media]] | date = 1999-12-23 | accessdate = 2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;Fishman received a mail fraud conviction three years earlier, and he claimed being brainwashed by the Church and that he had committed the crime to cover the cost of his Scientology sessions. The court rejected Fishman’s defense and he was soon after sued for libel by Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cowan |first1=Douglas E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=91me_xjHB_gC&amp;vq=fishman&amp;dq=Scientology+xenu+internet+OT&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Religion Online: Finding Faith on the Internet |editor-last=Cowan |editor-first=Douglas E. |editor2-last=Dawson |editor2-first=Lome L. |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |accessdate=2015-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As evidence, Fishman submitted course materials he said that he purchased from Ellie Bolger, a fellow Scientologist, and [[Richard Ofshe]], an expert witness for his defense. The Church says the documents were stolen and considers them to be [[copyright]]ed and a [[trade secret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/cyberlaw/scientology3.html |title=Court TV Library |date=1999-11-28 |accessdate=2007-08-22 |work=Court TV Online Legal Documents |quote=Plaintiff claims that these documents are protected from both unauthorized use and unauthorized disclosure under the copyright laws of the United States and under trade secret laws, respectively. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718105816/http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/cyberlaw/scientology3.html |archivedate=2007-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other materials, the [[affidavit]] contains 61 pages of the allegedly trade-secret and copyrighted story of [[Xenu]].

The Fishman Affidavit contains much text from the old versions of the Operating Thetan levels. The versions of OT I to OT VII in the Fishman Affidavit are considered authentic as the church's [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC) brought [[copyright]] lawsuits over their release on the [[Internet]]. Fishman's description of [[OT VIII]] contains the accusation that [[Jesus]] was a [[pedophile]]. After initially asserting copyright to all the OT level descriptions in the affidavit, RTC amended its claim to remove the OT VIII description, calling it a forgery. Fishman stated that he had obtained his copy of OT VIII from Ofshe, a different source than his copies of the other OT Levels, purchased from a fellow Scientologist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Fishman/fishman.html Press Release by Steven Fishman], "Press Release: Scientology upper level references (OT materials) affirmed unsealed and in the public domain by United States Court of Appeals.", Pages 1-7., April 28, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology dropped its libel case against Fishman and Geertz in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Wayne | last = Garcia | title = Church of Scientology settles suit with PR firm | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/51847739.html?dids=51847739:51847739&amp;FMT=FT | work = | publisher = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = 1994-07-07 | quote=Earlier this year, Scientology dropped its libel case against former Scientologist Steve Fishman and his therapist, Uwe Geertz. | accessdate = 2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important side aspect of the case was the fact that several high-ranking Scientology officials and lead attorneys for the organization and former high-ranking Scientologists submitted declarations on their activities for the Church of Scientology, giving thereby insight into the internal ongoings of the Scientology management.

Among others, declarations were submitted by:

* Richard Aznaran &amp; Vicki Aznaran, former executives of the [[Religious Technology Center]]
* Jonathan Epstein, at that time International [[Finance Director]] of the [[Church of Scientology International]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Declaration Jonathan Epstein 1994.pdf|Declaration of Jonathan Epstein, Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman &amp; Uwe Geertz, Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx), U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Los Angeles, February 7th, 1994]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posting to the Internet==
Although the Church of Scientology attempted to prevent others from receiving the document by continuously borrowing it, the text of this declaration and its exhibits were scanned, [[Optical character recognition|converted to text]], and posted onto the [[Usenet]] newsgroup [[alt.religion.scientology]] by ex-Scientologist [[Arnaldo Lerma|Arnie Lerma]].&lt;ref name="rtcvlerma"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.eff.org/legal/cases/Scientology_cases/brinkema_rtc_washpost_112895.opinion |title = Civil Action No. 95-1107-A |accessdate = 2007-10-10 |publisher = [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The material was then placed on the [[World Wide Web]] by [[David S. Touretzky]].

Lerma's newsgroup posting resulted in the August 1995 [[Scientology and the Internet|raid of his home]] for copyright violation on the materials, and the resulting lawsuit ''Religious Technology Center (Scientology) vs Arnaldo Lerma, Richard Leiby, and The Washington Post''.&lt;ref name="rtcvlerma"/&gt; U.S. Federal Judge [[Leonie Brinkema]] ruled that while Richard Leiby and the [[Washington Post]] had not violated copyright, Lerma was liable and fined $2,500 but with no costs awarded to Scientology. Judge Brinkema also stated that the primary motivation for the case was "to stifle criticism of Scientology in general and to harass its critics."&lt;ref name=nightmare&gt;{{cite web | first = Alan | last = Prendergast | title = Nightmare on the Net | url = http://www.westword.com/1997-03-06/news/nightmare-on-the-net/full | work = [[Westword|Denver Westword]] | publisher = [[Village Voice Media]] | date = 1997-03-06 | accessdate = 2008-07-08 }}

After being posted to the newsgroup, the documents were mirrored on hundreds of websites worldwide.&lt;ref name="scholarship"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/OTIII |title=OT III Scholarship Page |accessdate = 2007-10-10 |publisher = David S. Touretzky}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology responded by [[lawsuit|suing]] a number of people and their [[Internet service provider]]s for [[Scientology and the Internet|copyright infringement]]. The defendants responded by challenging the church to prove it was actually the copyright holder of the disputed documents.

The other notable case in connection with this was against [[Netherlands|Dutch]] writer [[Karin Spaink]]. The Church brought suit on copyright violation grounds for reproducing the source material, and claimed rewordings would reveal a trade secret. In 2003, Spaink won the case, with the court holding that her quotation of Scientology works was acceptable and expressing concern about Scientology's attempts to prevent discussion of its doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Wendy M. | last = Grossman | title = The mills of Xenu grind exceeding slow | url = http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=11516 | work = | publisher = [[The Inquirer]] | date = 2003-09-12 | accessdate = 2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church appealed but dropped the case after a negative advice on the appeal from the Attorney-General to the court in March 2005. In December 2005 the court dismissed the appeal, making the previous ruling final. The Church has no further possibility for appeal due to their dropping the case. The ruling also reversed earlier decisions affecting [[Hyperlinks|hyperlinking]].&lt;ref name="zdnetuk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/itmanagement/0,1000000308,39116197,00.htm |title = Hyperlinks remain legal after Scientology defeat |accessdate = 2007-10-10 |publisher = ZDNet UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the church have accused it of intentionally using lawsuits in these and other cases as [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|SLAPP]] suits, intended to silence their opposition. Critics of Steven Fishman have produced the affidavit of Kenneth D. Long, a Scientology executive, which states that Fishman received services from a Scientology mission, did a few introductory courses, never worked for the Church or [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights|CCHR]], and did not get any auditing or do any courses at the main Miami church, which would conflict with his claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whyaretheydead.net/krasel/aff_kl.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516095709/http://www.whyaretheydead.net/krasel/aff_kl.html |archivedate=2008-05-16 |df= }} Affidavit of Kenneth D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7325">'''The Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse''' is a term for [[internet]] [[criminal]]s, or the [[image]]ry of internet criminals.

==Popular usage==
A play on [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], it refers to types of criminals who use the internet to facilitate crime and consequently jeopardize the rights of honest internet users. There does not appear to be an exact definition for who the Horsemen are, but they are usually described as [[Terrorism|terrorist]]s, [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealer]]s, [[Pedophilia|pedophile]]s, and [[organized crime]]. Other sources use slightly different descriptions but generally refer to the same types of criminals. The term was [[Neologism|coined]] by [[Timothy C. May]] in 1988, who referred to them as "child pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{quotation|8.3.4. "How will privacy and anonymity be attacked?"
&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;
* like so many other "computer hacker" items, as a tool for the "Four Horsemen": drug-dealers, money-launderers,  terrorists, and pedophiles.

&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;
* Newspapers are complaining about the Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse:

}}

The term seems to be used less often in discussions about online criminal activity, but more often in discussions about the negative, or [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effects]] such activity has had on regular users' daily experiences online.
It is also used frequently to describe the political tactic "[[Think of the children]]".  A message from the [[Cypherpunk|same]] mailing list states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{quotation|How to get what you want in 4 easy stages:
# Have a target "thing" you wish to stop, yet lack any moral, or practical reasons for doing so?
# Pick a fear common to lots of people, something that will evoke a gut reaction: terrorists, pedophiles, serial killers.
# Scream loudly to the media that "thing" is being used by perpetrators.  (Don't worry if this is true, or common to all other things, or less common with "thing" than with other long established systems—payphones, paper mail, private hotel rooms, lack of bugs in all houses etc.)
# Say that the only way to stop perpetrators is to close down "thing", or to regulate it to death, or to have laws forcing en masse tapability of all private communications on "thing".  Don't worry if communicating on "thing" is a constitutionally protected right, if you have done a good job in choosing and publicising the horsemen in 2, no one will notice, they will be too busy clamouring for you to save them from the supposed evils.

==Examples==

In 2013, the director of the Safe Internet League (a voluntary [[Internet censorship in Russia|censorship group in Russia]]) claimed that pedophiles, perverts, drug dealers “and other creeps”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia’s FSB mulls ban on ‘Tor’ online anonymity network|url=https://www.rt.com/politics/russia-tor-anonymizer-ban-571/|website=Russia Today|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; were using the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] anonymity software, as a reason why the software should be outlawed.  This list did not mention terrorists or money-launderers directly, but did use the catch-all phrase "other creeps" that potentially includes them.

In 2015, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservative party]] claimed that their proposed “new communications data legislation will strengthen our ability to disrupt terrorist plots, criminal networks and organised child grooming gangs”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gayle|first1=Damien|title=Right to privacy 'could be meaningless in 10 years under Tory and Labour plans'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/22/right-to-privacy-could-be-meaningless-in-10-years-under-tory-and-labour-plans|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; echoing the "child pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, etc." quote of Timothy C. May.

Later in 2015, [[Gamma Group]] released a statement claiming that their surveillance technology is used "against terrorist threats, drug cartels, other major organised crime, and paedophile rings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Nick Hopkins|author2=Jake Morris|title=UK firm's surveillance kit 'used to crush Uganda opposition'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34529237|website=BBC News|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as justification for concerns that it was being used to target opposition politicians and media groups in [[Uganda]].  With money-laundering treated as a major organised crime, this quote matches very closely with the list given in the Cypherpunk FAQ.

'''''Freedom Evolves''''' is a 2003 popular science and philosophy book by [[Daniel C. Dennett]].  Dennett describes the book as an installment of a lifelong philosophical project, earlier parts of which were ''[[The Intentional Stance]]'', ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' and ''[[Elbow Room (book)|Elbow Room]]''. It attempts to give an account of [[free will]] and [[morality|moral]] responsibility which is complementary to Dennett's other views on [[consciousness]] and personhood.

== Synopsis ==
As in ''Consciousness Explained'', Dennett advertises the controversial nature of his views extensively in advance. He expects hostility from those who fear that a skeptical analysis of freedom will undermine people's belief in the reality of moral considerations; he likens himself to an interfering crow who insists on telling [[Dumbo]] he doesn't really need the feather he believes is allowing him to fly.

=== Free will  and altruism===

Dennett's stance on [[free will]] is [[compatibilism]] with an evolutionary twist &amp;ndash; the view that, although in the strict physical sense our actions might be pre-determined, we can still be free in all the ways that matter, because of the abilities we evolved.  Free will, seen this way, is about [[agency (philosophy)|freedom to make decisions]] without duress (and so is a version of Kantian positive practical free will, i.e., Kantian autonomy), as opposed to an impossible and unnecessary freedom from causality itself.  To clarify this distinction, he uses the term 'evitability' (the opposite of 'inevitability'), defining it as the ability of an agent to anticipate likely consequences and act to avoid undesirable ones. ''Evitability'' is entirely compatible with, and actually requires, human action being deterministic.
Dennett moves on to [[altruism]], denying that it requires acting to the benefit of others without gaining any benefit yourself.  He argues that it should be understood in terms of helping yourself by helping others, expanding the self to be more inclusive as opposed to being selfless.  To show this blend, he calls such actions 'benselfish', and finds the roots of our capacity for this in the [[evolution]]ary pressures that produced [[kin selection]].  
In his treatment of both free will and altruism, he starts by showing why we should not accept the traditional definitions of either term.

===Beneficial mutual arrangements===

Dennett also suggests that adherence to high [[ethical]] standards might pay off for the individual, because if others know your behaviour is restricted in these ways, the scope for certain beneficial mutual arrangements is enhanced.  This is related to [[Game theory|game theoretical]] considerations: in the famous [[Prisoner's Dilemma]], 'moral' agents who cooperate will be more successful than 'non-moral' agents who do not cooperate.  Cooperation wouldn't seem to naturally arise since agents are tempted to 'defect' and restore a [[Nash equilibrium]], which is often not the best possible solution for all involved.  Dennett concludes by contemplating the possibility that people might be able to opt in or out of moral responsibility: surely, he suggests, given the benefits, they would choose to opt in, especially given that opting out includes such things as being imprisoned or institutionalized.

===Libet's experiments===
Daniel Dennett also argues that no clear conclusion about volition can be derived from [[Benjamin Libet]]'s experiments supposedly demonstrating the non-existence of conscious volition. According to Dennett, ambiguities in the timings of the different events are involved. Libet tells when the readiness potential occurs objectively, using electrodes, but relies on the subject reporting the position of the hand of a clock to determine when the conscious decision was made. As Dennett points out, this is only a report of where it ''seems'' to the subject that various things come together, not of the objective time at which they actually occur.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suppose Libet knows that your readiness potential peaked at millisecond 6,810 of the experimental trial, and the clock dot was straight down (which is what you reported you saw) at millisecond 7,005. How many milliseconds should he have to add to this number to get the time you were conscious of it? The light gets from your clock face to your eyeball almost instantaneously, but the path of the signals from  retina through lateral geniculate nucleus to striate cortex takes 5 to 10 milliseconds&amp;mdash;a paltry fraction of the 300 milliseconds offset, but how much longer does it take them to get to ''you''. (Or are you located in the striate cortex?) The visual signals have to be processed before they arrive at wherever they need to arrive for you to make a conscious decision of simultaneity. Libet's method presupposes, in short, that we can locate the ''intersection'' of two trajectories:
* the rising-to-consciousness of signals representing the decision to flick
* the rising to consciousness of signals representing successive clock-face orientations
so that these events occur side-by-side as it were in  place where their simultaneity can be noted.&lt;ref&gt;"Freedom Evolves" by Daniel Dennett, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/SelfasaResponding.pdf Dennett, D. ''The Self as Responding and Responsible Artefact'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Robert Kane===
Dennett spends a chapter criticising [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]]'s theory of [[libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian free will]]. Kane believes freedom is based on certain rare and exceptional events, which he calls self-forming actions or SFA's. Dennett notes that there is no guarantee such an event will occur in an individual's life. If it does not, the individual does not in fact have free will at all, according to Kane. Yet they will seem the same as anyone else. Dennett finds an essentially ''indetectable'' notion of free will to be incredible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5766">[[Image:Gridcosm-795-796-zoom.png|thumb|Creation of new level on Gridcosm. (Click for more info)]] '''Gridcosm''' is a [[collaborative]] art project of the online [[art collective]] [[SITO]], in which artists from around the world contribute images to a compounding series of graphical squares. Each ''level'' of Gridcosm is made up of nine square images arranged into a 3-by-3 grid. The middle image is a one-third size version of the previous level. Artists add images around that center image until a new 3-by-3 grid is completed, then that level itself shrinks and becomes the "seed" for the next level. This process creates an ever-expanding tunnel of images, the newest level a direct result of the previous level which is a result of the previous level... and so on.

As of March 2018, 365 artists have contributed more than 4260 levels (over 34,081 individual images) to the project.

==Gridcosm origins==
The Gridcosm was started March 30, 1997 by founder of SITO, Ed Stastny. The project built upon the ideas and experiences with previous SITO collaborative projects ("Synergy" projects), many of which were grid-based.

There have been many changes to the infrastructure of the Gridcosm since its 1997 inception.
* Process of generating new level changed from manual to automatic after the first few levels
* Software rewrite and move to [[database]]: mid-2000
* After 8 years, the background color of the Gridcosm page is changed from black to white: July 2005
* The ability for users to add "[[Tag (metadata)|tags]]" to current and past levels: April 2006

[[Image:Gridcosm-795-artistmap.png|thumb|Artist map of level 795. (Click for more info)]]

==Grid poem==
In addition to the images in the gridcosm, there is a text element as well. When submitting a square to the grid, the user adds a text fragment which becomes associated with that square. Before submitting the text, the user can preview any text that comes before or after. This allows the user to choose words or fragments of sentences, allowing them to "blend" the text of the poem if they choose. Hyperlinks can also be added to the submitted text, although this is infrequent.
* An example of a completed grid poem: "When you find yourself plummeting, please jump right in clawwing the age haw if sis first time with the gimp, not as smooth as pshop and it goes like this, tirelessly toiling with trumpets and fanfare." - Level 2819 [http://www.sito.org/cgi-bin/gridcosm/gridcosm?level=2819]

Additionally, when a new level is created, there must be some "seed" of text for users to add on to. This text is created by an algorithim. In earlier levels of the Gridcosm this "seed" of text was not as random as it is now. Various phrases such as "groblin attack" and "this should have been something better" were often used.

==Gridcosm Activity report==
The details of the Gridcosm are captured with every piece added to the level and information about the work and the participants can be viewed using the Gridcosm [http://www.sito.org/cgi-bin/gridcosm/cosmost Activity Report]. A report can be viewed on the Gridcosm as a whole, with such information as the number of levels, the overall number of artists and much more.

There are also Individual artist reports which break down the contributions any given artist into categories such as number of pieces, average time between pieces, position popularity and much more.

==Significant Gridcosm firsts==
* First use of coordinate as graphic element: User AUS [http://www.sito.org/cgi-bin/gridcosm/cosmost?id=AUS], Level 1 [http://www.sito.org/cgi-bin/gridcosm/gridcosm?level=1]

* Current Forum Debut: 2000-01-12 03:12:17 [http://www.sito.org/cgi-bin/discussion/discuss?num=51]

=="Fly-through" animation==
The structure of the project lends itself to animated traversals, called "fly-throughs". These can take the form of a zoom-in, going into the past, or a zoom-out, moving toward the present day. Notably, Lenara Verle produced a high quality animation of the first 1000 levels of Gridcosm, which was scored with a [[soundtrack]] made by SITO artists. In 2005, this animation won an International Media Award [http://www.goethe.de/ins/es/bar/acv/med/2005/de954475v.htm].

Higher-order theories are distinguished from other [[Cognition|cognitive]]/representational accounts of consciousness which suggest that merely first-order mentality of certain sorts constitutes consciousness.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

==Motivation==

Higher-order theory can account for the distinction between unconscious and conscious brain processing. Both types of mental operations involve first-order manipulations, and according to higher-order theory, what makes cognition conscious is a higher-order observation of the first-order processing.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

In [[neuroscience]] terms, higher-order theory is motivated by the distinction between first-order information in early sensory regions versus higher-order representations in [[Prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] and [[Parietal lobe|parietal cortices]].&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|365–66}}

==Types==

===Higher-order perception theory===

Also called '''inner-sense theory''', this version of higher-order theory proposes that phenomenal consciousness consists not in immediate sensations but in higher-level sensing of those [[Sensation (psychology)|sensations]]. Or put another way:
: A phenomenally conscious mental state is a state with analog/non-conceptual [[Intentionality|intentional]] content, which is in turn the target of a higher-order analog/non-conceptual intentional state, via the operations of a faculty of 'inner sense'.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;
One motivation for this approach is that it accounts for phenomenal consciousness absent beliefs or behaviors associated with those experiences—so that, e.g., someone could feel pain without necessarily exhibiting functional reactions to pain.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

===Actualist higher-order thought theory===

[[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David Rosenthal]] is a foremost advocate of this view. It claims that a mental state is conscious when it's the subject of a '''higher-order thought''' (HOT). Phenomenal consciousness in particular corresponds to certain kinds of mental states (e.g., visual inputs) that are the subjects of HOTs. Rosenthal excludes the special case in which one learns about one's lower-order states by conscious deduction. For instance, if [[psychoanalysis]] could reveal one's unconscious motives, this would not suddenly make them conscious.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

===Dispositionalist higher-order thought theory===

The dispositionalist mirrors the actualist view except that the first-order mental state needn't actually be thought about—it only needs to be available to potentially be thought about.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

While actualist accounts would seem to require immense higher-order computation on all first-order percepts, dispositionalist accounts do not; they merely require ''availability'' of first-order information. Such availability could come from, e.g., global broadcasting as in the [[Global Workspace Theory]].&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;

===Self-representational higher-order theories===

Self-representational higher-order theories consider the higher-order state to be ''constitutive'' or ''internal'' to its first-order state.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt; This may be either because
# the first-order and higher-order states are identical, with the same state serving two different roles, or
# the first-order and higher-order states are part of the same whole, and the whole complex is what becomes conscious.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;
An example of the second, "part-whole" self-representational theory is Vincent Picciuto's "quotational theory of consciousness" in which consciousness consists of "mentally quoting" a first-order perception.&lt;ref name=Picciuto2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Picciuto|first1=Vincent|title=Consciousness and Mental Quotation: An intrinsic higher-order approach|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1903/15231|website=Digital Repository at the University of Maryland|accessdate=31 August 2014|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher-order statistical inference view===

In this theory, higher-level processing determines that a first-order representation is reliable.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|366}}

===Radical plasticity thesis===

Similar to a HOT view, this theory proposes that the brain "learns" when there exists a trustworthy lower-level representation.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|366}}

==Scientific perspectives==

Higher-order theories originated in philosophy, but they have also gained some scientific defenders.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hakwan Lau|author2=David Rosenthal|title=Empirical support for higher-order theories of conscious awareness|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=Aug 2011|volume=15|issue=8|pages=365–373|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2011.05.009|url=http://www.summer12.isc.uqam.ca/page/docs/readings/Lau-Hakwan/Lau-Rosenthal-Empirical-support-for-higher-order-theories-of-conscious-awareness.pdf|pmid=21737339}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|365}} Here are some examples of evidence supporting higher-order views:
* Reporting of conscious experience seems in some studies to occur serially following unconscious processing rather than in parallel with it.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|368}}
* Unconscious processing is quite powerful on its own, so it's not obvious that task performance requires consciousness. Higher-order views agree with this, unlike, e.g., global-workspace views.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|368}}
* Impairments to the prefrontal cortex may impair subjective reports without affecting task performance. If the prefrontal cortex were mainly serving an attentional role, performance should degrade along with reportability.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|369}}
* Some interpretations of certain disorders of consciousness suggest that they operate by affecting the prefrontal cortex, where higher-order thoughts are assumed to take place.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|370–71}}

[[Edmund Rolls]] defends a higher-order account of consciousness. He argues that consciousness consists in higher-order thoughts allowing one to monitor and correct errors and "that the brain systems that are required for consciousness and language are similar."&lt;ref name=Rolls2005&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edmund T. Rolls|title=Emotion Explained|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0198570035}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|404–05}} [[Qualia]] like pain become conscious when "they enter into a specialized linguistic symbol-manipulation system, which is part of a higher-order thought system" that helps with, inter alia, "flexible planning of actions."&lt;ref name=Rolls2005 /&gt;{{rp|407}}

==Criticisms==

===Against inner-sense and actualist HOT views===

Scott Sturgeon argues against inner-sense theory on the grounds that it could give rise to disorders in which, e.g., one has a first-order perception of red which mis-triggers a second-order sense of "looks orange". But we don't see any such disorders in [[neurology]].&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sturgeon2000&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sturgeon|first1=Scott|title=Matters of Mind: Consciousness, Reason and Nature|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, inner-sense and actualist views face the "targetless higher-order representation problem" in which there might be, e.g., a higher-order experience/thought about perceiving red without a corresponding first-order redness percept.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt; One reply is that this is no more a problem for higher-order theories than for other neuroscientific theories of consciousness, which also involve many layers of processing that could theoretically be inconsistent.&lt;ref name=LauRosenthal2011 /&gt;{{rp|370}}

[[Peter Carruthers (philosopher)|Peter Carruthers]] points out that inner sense of or actualist HOTs about first-order percepts might greatly increase the computing power required to consciously process stimuli, for not only does one need to have a perception, but one then needs to have another (perhaps highly detailed) perception or thought about that perception.&lt;ref name=Carruthers2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Carruthers2000&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carruthers|first1=Peter|title=Phenomenal Consciousness: A Naturalistic Theory|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against any higher-order view===

The "rock objection" notes that thinking about a rock doesn't cause the rock to "light up" with consciousness, so why does thinking about a first-order percept cause it to light up? Higher-order theorists reply that first-order states need to be mental states, which rocks are not.

{{terrorism}}
The '''history of terrorism''' is a history of well-known and historically significant individuals, entities, and incidents associated, whether rightly or wrongly, with [[terrorism]]. Scholars agree that terrorism is a [[definition of terrorism|disputed term]], and very few of those labeled terrorists describe themselves as such. It is common for opponents in a violent conflict to describe the other side as terrorists or as practicing terrorism.&lt;ref name=tws11janbcvc&gt;{{cite news|author1=Paul Reynolds |author2=quoting David Hannay |author3=Former UK ambassador |title= UN staggers on road to reform|quote= This would end the argument that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter...|publisher= BBC News|date= 14 September 2005|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4244842.stm|accessdate= 2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on how broadly the term is defined, the roots and practice of terrorism can be traced at least to the 1st-century AD [[Sicarii Zealots]], though some dispute whether the group, which [[assassination|assassinated]] collaborators with Roman rule in the province of [[Judea]], was in fact terrorist. The first use in English of the term 'terrorism' occurred during the [[French Revolution]]'s [[Reign of Terror]], when the [[Jacobins]], who ruled the revolutionary state, employed violence, including mass executions by guillotine, to compel obedience to the state and intimidate regime enemies.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/opinion/28furstenberg.html|title=Opinion - Bush’s Dangerous Liaisons|first=François|last=Furstenberg|date=28 October 2007|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association of the term only with state violence and intimidation lasted until the mid-19th century, when it began to be associated with non-governmental groups. [[Anarchism]], often in league with rising [[nationalism]] and [[anti-monarchism]], was the most prominent ideology linked with terrorism. Near the end of the 19th century, anarchist groups or individuals committed assassinations of a Russian Tsar and a U.S. President.

In the 20th century, terrorism continued to be associated with a vast array of anarchist, socialist, fascist and nationalist groups, many of them engaged in '[[third world]]' anti-colonial struggles. Some scholars also labeled as terrorist the systematic internal violence and intimidation practiced by states such as the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)|Stalinist Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="NaziTerror"&gt;{{Citation|title=Nazi Terror Begins |publisher=United States Holocaust Museum |date=20 June 2014 |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005686}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foundations"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin A.

The term terrorist is believed to have originated during the [[Reign of Terror]] (September 5, 1793{{snds}}July 28, 1794) in France. It was a period of eleven months during the [[French Revolution]] when the ruling [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] employed violence, including mass executions by [[guillotine]], in order to intimidate the regime's enemies and compel obedience to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/recent/sept_11/changing_faces_01.shtml|title=BBC - History - The Changing Faces of Terrorism|date=|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jacobins, most famously Robespierre, sometimes referred to themselves as "terrorists".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; Some modern scholars, however, do not consider the Reign of Terror a form of terrorism, in part because it was carried out by the French state.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chialand, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early terrorism==
[[File:Asabah2.jpg|thumb|right|Artistic rendering of [[Hassan-i Sabbah]]]]

Scholars dispute whether the roots of terrorism date back to the 1st century and the [[Sicarii Zealots]], to the 11th century and the Al-[[Hashshashin]], to the 19th century and the [[Fenian Brotherhood]] and [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]], or to other eras.&lt;ref name="cdi.org"&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/friendlyversion/printversion.cfm?documentID=1502 History of Terrorism article by Mark Burgess] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511140810/http://www.cdi.org/friendlyversion/printversion.cfm?documentID=1502 |date=2012-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The Sicarii and the Hashshashin are described below, while the Fenian Brotherhood and Narodnaya Volya are discussed in the 19th Century sub-section. Other pre-Reign of Terror historical events sometimes associated with terrorism include the [[Gunpowder Plot]], an attempt to destroy the English [[Palace of Westminster|Parliament]] in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berr.gov.uk/fireworks/download/FW1434_Keystage2_07.pdf] http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090609003228/http://www.berr.gov.uk/fireworks/download/FW1434_Keystage2_07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1st century CE, the [[Zealotry|Jewish Zealots]] in [[Judaea Province]] rebelled, killing prominent collaborators with Roman rule.&lt;ref name="cdi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.56&lt;/ref&gt; In 6 CE, according to contemporary historian [[Josephus]], [[Judas of Galilee]] formed a small and more extreme offshoot of the Zealots, the [[Sicarii]] ("dagger men").&lt;ref name="Chaliand, Gerard 2007. p.68"/&gt; Their efforts were also directed against Jewish "collaborators," including temple priests, [[Sadducees]], [[Herodians]], and other wealthy elites.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josephus, the Sicarii would hide short daggers under their cloaks, mingle with crowds at large festivals, murder their victims, and then disappear into the panicked crowds. Their most successful assassination was of the [[List of High Priests of Israel|High Priest of Israel]] Jonathan.&lt;ref name="Chaliand, Gerard 2007. p.68"/&gt;

In the late 11th century, the [[Hashshashin]] (a.k.a. the Assassins) arose, an offshoot of the [[Isma'ili]] sect of [[Shia]] [[Muslim]]s.&lt;ref name="Rapoport, David 1984. p.658"&gt;Rapoport, David. "Fear and Trembling: Terrorism in Three Religious Traditions." ''American Political Science Review'', 1984. p.658&lt;/ref&gt; Led by [[Hassan-i Sabbah]] and opposed to [[Fatimid]] rule, the Hashshashin militia seized Alamut and other fortress strongholds across Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, Peter. ''The Castles of the Assassins''. New York: Linden Press, 2001. p.19&lt;/ref&gt; Hashshashin forces were too small to challenge enemies militarily, so they assassinated city governors and military commanders in order to create alliances with militarily powerful neighbors. For example, they killed Janah al-Dawla, ruler of [[Homs]], to please [[Ridwan of Aleppo]], and assassinated [[Mawdud]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] emir of [[Mosul]], as a favor to the regent of [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;Daftary, Farhad. ''The Assassin Legends: Myths of the Isma'ilis''. London: I. B. Tauris, 1995. p.42&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hashshashin]] also carried out assassinations as retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, Marshall G. S. ''The Secret Order of Assassins: The Struggle of the Early Nizari Ismai'lis Against the Islamic World''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2005. p.83&lt;/ref&gt; Under some definitions of terrorism, such [[assassinations]] do not qualify as terrorism, since killing a political leader does not intimidate political enemies or inspire revolt.&lt;ref name="cdi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaliand, Gerard 2007. p.68"&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sons of Liberty]] was a clandestine group that formed in [[Boston]] and [[New York City]] in the 1770s. It had a political agenda of independence of Britain's American colonies. The groups engaged in several acts that could be considered terroristic and used the deeds for propaganda purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.varsitytutors.com/earlyamerica/early-america-review/volume-1/sons-liberty-patriots-terrorists|title=Sons of Liberty: Patriots or Terrorists? - Archiving Early America|website=www.varsitytutors.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, 1605, a group of conspirators led by [[Robert Catesby]] attempted to destroy the English Parliament on its State Opening by King James I. They planned in secret to detonate a large quantity of [[gunpowder]] placed beneath the [[Palace of Westminster]]. The gunpowder was procured and placed by [[Guy Fawkes]]. The group intended to enact a coup by killing King James I and the members of both houses of Parliament. The conspirators planned to make one of the king's children a puppet monarch and then restore the Catholic faith to England. The conspirator leased a coal cellar beneath the House of Lords and began stockpiling gunpowder in 1604. As well as its primary targets, it would have killed hundreds, if not thousands, of Londoners – the most devastating act of terrorism in Britain's history, plunging the nation into a religious war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/4671842/gunpowder-plot-1605-robert-catesby-guy-fawkes-houses-of-parliament/|title=How Britain's first terrorists almost changed the course of history with the Gunpowder Plot|date=5 November 2017|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; English spymasters uncovered the plot and caught Guy Fawkes with the gunpowder beneath Parliament. The other conspirators fled to Holbeach in Staffordshire. A shoot out on November 8 with authorities led to the deaths of Robert Catesby, Thomas Percy and the brothers Christopher and John Wright. The rest were captured.  Fawkes and seven others were tried and executed in January 1606.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/simon-adams/gunpowder-plot-terror-and-toleration|title=The Gunpowder Plot: Terror and Toleration - History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planned attack has become known as the Gunpowder Plot and is commemorated in Britain every November 5 with fireworks displays and large bonfires with effigies of Guy Fawkes and [[the Pope]] are often burned.

[[File:Fenian guy fawkesr1867reduced.png|thumb|250px|"The Fenian Guy Fawkes" by [[John Tenniel]], published in [[Punch magazine]], on 28 December 1867]]

One of the earliest groups to utilize modern terrorist techniques was arguably the [[Fenian Brotherhood]] and its offshoot the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/adulted/coursesbycode/hn258/|title=Terrorism: From the Fenians to Al Qaeda|accessdate=2014-01-09}}http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/terrorism/&lt;/ref&gt; They were both founded in 1858 as revolutionary, militant nationalist and Catholic groups, both in Ireland and amongst the emigre community in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Freedom, by Richard English Publisher: Pan Books (2 November 2007), {{ISBN|0-330-42759-8}} p179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irish Freedom, by Richard English Publisher: Pan Books (2 November 2007), {{ISBN|0-330-42759-8}} p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

After centuries of continued British rule, and influenced most recently from the devastating effects of the 1840s [[Irish potato famine]], these revolutionary fraternal organisations were founded with the aim of establishing an independent republic in Ireland, and began carrying out frequent acts of violence in metropolitan Britain to achieve their aims through intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Freedom, by Richard English Publisher: Pan Books (2 November 2007), {{ISBN|0-330-42759-8}} p3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, members of the movement's leadership were arrested and convicted for organizing an [[Fenian Rising|armed uprising]]. While being transferred to [[Belle Vue Gaol|prison]], the police van in which they were being transported was intercepted and a [[police]] sergeant was shot in the rescue. A bolder rescue attempt of another Irish radical incarcerated in [[Clerkenwell Prison]], was made in the same year: an explosion to demolish the prison wall killed 12 people and caused many injuries. The bombing enraged the British public, causing a panic over the Fenian threat.

Although the Irish Republican Brotherhood condemned the Clerkenwell Outrage as a "dreadful and deplorable event", the organisation returned to bombings in Britain in 1881 to 1885, with the [[Fenian dynamite campaign]], beginning one of the first modern terror campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whelehan|first=Niall|title=The Dynamiters: Irish Nationalism and Political Violence in the Wider World 1867–1900|year=2012|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of earlier forms of terrorism based on political assassination, this campaign used modern, timed explosives with the express aim of sowing fear in the very heart of metropolitan Britain, in order to achieve political gains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theirishstory.com/2012/02/13/one-skilled-scientist-is-worth-an-army-the-fenian-dynamite-campaign-1881-85/#.UkniH3-tbXQ|title=The Fenian Dynamite campaign 1881–85|accessdate=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; – ([[Prime minister]] [[William Ewart Gladstone]] was partly influenced to disestablish the [[Anglican Church in Ireland]] as a gesture by the Clerkenwell bombing). The campaign also took advantage of the greater global integration of the times, and the bombing was largely funded and organised by the [[Fenian Brotherhood]] in the United States.

The first police unit to combat terrorism was established in 1883 by the [[Metropolitan Police]], initially as a small section of the [[Criminal Investigation Department]]. It was known as the [[Special Irish Branch]], and was trained in counter terrorism techniques to combat the Irish Republican Brotherhood. The unit's name was changed to Special Branch as the unit's remit steadily widened over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Secret War Exhibition, Imperial War Museum London&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anarchism and "propaganda of the deed"===
[[File:I Grinevizky.jpg|170px|thumb|right|[[Ignacy Hryniewiecki]], a terrorist who assassinated Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]]]]

The concept of "[[propaganda of the deed]]" (or "propaganda by the deed", from the French ''propagande par le fait'') advocated physical [[violence]] or other provocative public acts against political enemies in order to inspire mass rebellion or [[revolution]]. One of the first individuals associated with this concept, the Italian revolutionary [[Carlo Pisacane]] (1818{{ndash}}1857), wrote in his "Political Testament" (1857) that "ideas spring from deeds and not the other way around". [[Anarchist]] [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1814{{ndash}}1876), in his "Letters to a Frenchman on the Present Crisis" (1870) stated that "we must spread our principles, not with words but with deeds, for this is the most popular, the most potent, and the most irresistible form of propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1870/letter-frenchman.htm|title=Works of Mikhail Bakunin 1870|author=Mikhail Bakunin|date=|work=marxists.org|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French [[anarchist]] [[Paul Brousse]] (1844{{ndash}}1912) popularized the phrase "propaganda of the deed"; in 1877 he cited as examples the 1871 [[Paris Commune]] and a workers' demonstration in [[Berne]] provocatively using the socialist red flag.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas]]''&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s, the slogan had begun to be used{{by whom|date=April 2015}} to refer to bombings, [[regicide]]s and [[tyrannicide]]s. Reflecting this new understanding of the term, in 1895 Italian anarchist [[Errico Malatesta]] described "propaganda by the deed" (which he opposed the use of) as violent communal insurrections meant to ignite an imminent revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm|title=Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume One - ,  - Black Rose Books|date=|work=blackrosebooks.net|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in Russia in 1878, [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]] (''Народная Воля'' in Russian; ''People's Will'' in English) was a revolutionary anarchist group inspired by [[Sergei Nechayev]] and by "propaganda by the deed" theorist Pisacane.&lt;ref name="cdi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoffman, Bruce 1998. p. 5"/&gt; The group developed ideas—such as [[targeted killing]] of the "leaders of oppression"—that would become the hallmark of subsequent violence by small non-state groups, and they were convinced that the developing technologies of the age—such as the invention of dynamite, which they were the first anarchist group to make widespread use of&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Terrorism'', by Walter Laqueur, Transaction Publishers, 2000, {{ISBN|0-7658-0799-8}}, p. 92 [https://books.google.com/books?id=RlqQHKpLfL8C&amp;dq=dynamite+terrorism+history&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt;—enabled them to strike directly and with discrimination.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; Attempting to spark a popular revolt against Russian Tsardom, the group killed prominent political figures by gun and bomb, and on March 13, 1881, assassinated Russia's Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].&lt;ref name="cdi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoffman, Bruce 1998. p. 5"&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The assassination, by a bomb that also killed the Tsar's attacker, [[Ignacy Hryniewiecki]], failed to spark the expected revolution, and an ensuing crackdown brought the group to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual Europeans also engaged in politically motivated violence. For example, in 1893, [[Auguste Vaillant]], a French [[Anarchism|anarchist]], threw a bomb in the French [[Chamber of Deputies]] in which one person was injured.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1894/02/06/archives/the-guillotines-sure-work-details-of-the-execution-of-vaillant-the.html The Guillotine's Sure Work; Details of the Execution of Vaillant, the Anarchist]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1984-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to Vaillant's bombing and other bombings and assassination attempts, the French government restricted [[freedom of the press]] by passing a set of [[law]]s that became pejoratively known as the ''[[lois scélérates]]'' ("villainous laws"). In the years 1894 to 1896 anarchists killed President of France [[Marie Francois Carnot]], Prime Minister of Spain [[Antonio Cánovas del Castillo]], and the Empress of Austria-Hungary, [[Elisabeth of Bavaria]].

===The United States===
Prior to the [[American Civil War]], [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] (1800{{ndash}}1859) advocated and practiced armed opposition to [[slavery]], leading several attacks between 1856 and 1859, the most famous attack was launched in 1859 against the [[Harpers Ferry Armory|armory]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]]. Local forces soon recaptured the fort and Brown was tried and executed for [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/04/22/AR2005042201172_pf.html | work=The Washington Post | title=The Good Terrorist | first=David W. | last=Blight |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biographer of Brown has written that Brown's purpose was "to force the nation into a new political pattern by creating terror."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Scott, ''The Secret Six: John Brown and the Abolitionist Movement'' (Murphys, Calif.: Uncommon Books, 1979, 1983), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the 150th anniversary of Brown's death, prominent news publications debated over whether or not Brown should be considered a terrorist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2009/dec/02/john-brown-civil-war| work=The Guardian (UK) |title=Let's debate John Brown: terrorist, or no?| first=Michael|last=Tomasky|date=December 2, 2009|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/opinion/02reynolds.html?ref=opinion&amp;_r=0|work=New York Times| title=Freedom's Martyr|first=David S.|last=Reynolds|date=December 1, 2009|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/opinion/02horwitz.html?ref=opinion|work=New York Times| title=The 9/11 of 1859|first=Tony|last=Horwitz|date=December 1, 2009|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kkk-carpetbagger-cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|A cartoon threatening that the KKK will [[lynching in the United States|lynch]] [[carpetbagger]]s, in the ''Independent Monitor'', [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]], 1868]]

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], on December 24, 1865, six [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veterans created the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK).&lt;ref&gt;Horn, 1939, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The KKK used violence, lynching, murder and acts of intimidation such as [[cross burning]] to oppress [[African Americans]] in particular, and it created a sensation with its masked forays' dramatic nature.&lt;ref name="Jackson 1992 ed., pp. 241-242"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/filelink.html?file=/publications/terror/terror2000_2001.pdf|title=Terrorism 2000/2001|accessdate=2009-03-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320174902/https://www.fbi.gov/publications/terror/terror2000_2001.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's politics were [[white supremacy|white supremacist]], [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]], [[racism|racist]], [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]], and [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]].&lt;ref name="Jackson 1992 ed., pp. 241-242"&gt;Jackson 1992 ed., pp. 241–242.&lt;/ref&gt; A KKK founder boasted that it was a nationwide organization of 550,000 men and that it could muster 40,000 Klansmen within five days' notice, but as a secret or "[[Invisible dictatorship|invisible]]" group with no membership rosters, it was difficult to judge the Klan's actual size. The KKK has at times been politically powerful, and at various times it controlled the governments of [[Tennessee]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Indiana]] and [[South Carolina]], as well as several legislatures in [[Southern United States|the South]].&lt;ref&gt;Marty Gitlin, ''The Ku Klux Klan: A Guide to an American Subculture'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/library/2848.htm|title=ISL: Ku Klux Klan in Indiana|website=www.in.gov|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ottoman Empire===
Several nationalist groups used violence against an [[Ottoman Empire]] in apparent decline. One was the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (in Armenian ''Dashnaktsuthium'', or "The Federation"), a revolutionary movement founded in [[Tiflis]] (Russian Transcaucasia) in 1890 by [[Christapor Mikaelian]]. Many members had been part of [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]] or the [[Hunchakian Revolutionary Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Balakian, Peter. ''The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response.'' New York: Harper Perennial, 2004. p.104&lt;/ref&gt; The group published newsletters, smuggled arms, and hijacked buildings as it sought to bring in European intervention that would force the Ottoman Empire to surrender control of its Armenian territories.&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.193&lt;/ref&gt; On August 24, 1896, 17-year-old Babken Suni led twenty-six members in [[1896 Ottoman Bank Takeover|capturing the Imperial Ottoman Bank in Constantinople]]. The group demanded European intervention in order to stop the [[Hamidian massacres]] and the creation of an Armenian state, but backed down on a threat to blow up the bank. An ensuing security crackdown destroyed the group.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Bruce. ''Inside Terrorism''. New York: Columbia University Press, 2006. Page 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also inspired by Narodnaya Volya, the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) was a revolutionary movement founded in 1893 by Hristo Tatarchev in the Ottoman-controlled Macedonian territories.&lt;ref name="Ross, Jeffrey Ian 2006. p.34"&gt;Ross, Jeffrey Ian. ''Political Terrorism: An Interdisciplinary Approach''. New York: Peter Lang Press, 2006. p.34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Robert. ''Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History''. New York: Picador, 2005. p.56&lt;/ref&gt; Through assassinations and by provoking uprisings, the group sought to coerce the Ottoman government into creating a Macedonian nation.&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.189&lt;/ref&gt; On July 20, 1903, the group incited the Ilinden uprising in the Ottoman villayet of Monastir. The IMRO declared the town's independence and sent demands to the [[European Powers]] that all of Macedonia be freed.&lt;ref&gt;Danforth, Loring. ''The Macedonian Conflict.'' Princeton University Press, 1997. p.87&lt;/ref&gt; The demands were ignored and Turkish troops crushed the 27,000 rebels in the town two months later.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Robert. ''Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History''. New York: Picador, 2005. p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==
[[File:Minutos previos al atentado en Sarajevo.jpg|thumb|The assassination of the heir to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] throne, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], precipitated a [[First World War|global war]]]]
[[File:Nathuram godse.jpg|thumb|[[Nathuram Godse]], the assassin of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in 1948 was the first terrorist of independent [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=rUYyhMxHqnQC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=godse+first+Terrorist&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEjoz-04HeAhWIvo8KHbZwC7AQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=godse%20first%20Terrorist&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pressreader.com/india/the-times-of-india-mumbai-edition/20170725/281762744320909&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Revolutionary nationalism continued to motivate political violence in the 20th century, much of it directed against western colonial powers. The [[Irish Republican Army]] campaigned against the British in the 1910s and inspired the [[Zionism|Zionist]] groups [[Hagannah]], [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] to fight the British throughout the 1930s in the Palestine mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, J. Bowyer. ''Terror Out of Zion: Irgun Zvai Leumi, Lehi and the Palestine Underground, 1929–1949''.

''The Society of the Muslim Brothers in Egypt: The Rise of an Islamic Mass Movement 1928–1942''. Ithaca Press, 2006. p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

The women's [[suffrage movement]] in the UK also committed terrorist attacks prior to the [[First World War]]. There were three phases of [[Women's Social and Political Union|WSPU]] militancy in 1905, 1908, 1913; including civil disobedience, destruction of public property and arson and bombings. Most notably, The WSPU burned down Government Minister, and future Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]]'s house&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Rowland|first= Peter|authorlink= Peter Rowland|title= David Lloyd George:a biography|publisher= Macmillan|page= 228|year= 1978|url= https://books.google.com/?id=u5WfAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; (despite his support for women's suffrage).

Political assassinations continued, resulting in the assassinations of King [[Umberto I of Italy]], killed in July 1900 and US President [[William McKinley]] in September 1901. Political violence became especially widespread in [[Imperial Russia]], and several ministers were killed in the opening years of the 20th century. The highest-ranking was prime minister [[Pyotr Stolypin]], killed in 1911 by Dmitry Bogrov, a spy for the secret police in several anarchist, socialist and other revolutionary groups.&lt;ref&gt;Fontanka 16: The Tsars' Secret Police, by Charles A. Ruud, Sergei A. Stepanov&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 1914, [[Gavrilo Princip]], one of a group of six assassins, shot and killed [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], heir to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] throne, and his wife, [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg]], in [[Sarajevo]], the capital of the Condominion  of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The assassinations produced widespread shock across Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/100-years-since-the-assassination-of-archduke-franz-ferdinand-the-shot-that-sparked-the-first-world-9570029.html|title=100 years since the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand: How did|date=28 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting in motion a series of events which led to [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/08/first-world-war-franz-ferdinand-sarajevo|title=First World War: Reports of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo|date=8 November 2008|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the [[Nazi]] regime in Germany and [[Stalin]]'s rule in [[the Soviet Union]] practiced [[state terror]] systematically and on a massive and unprecedented scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Hitler vs. Stalin: Who Was Worse?|publisher= New York Review of Books|date= 27 January 2011|url= http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2011/jan/27/hitler-vs-stalin-who-was-worse/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Stalin regime branded its opponents with the label "terrorist".&lt;ref&gt;

===Irish independence===
In an action called the [[Easter Rising]] or [[Easter Rebellion]], on April 24, 1916, members of the [[Irish Volunteers]] and the [[Irish Citizen Army]] seized the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|Dublin General Post Office]] and several other buildings, proclaiming an independent Irish Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.185&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion failed militarily but was a success for [[physical force Irish republicanism]], leaders of the uprising becoming Irish heroes after their eventual execution by the British government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/easterrising/aftermath/af01.shtml|title= BBC - History - 1916 Easter Rising - Aftermath - The Executions|date= |work= bbc.co.uk|accessdate= 27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sackville Street (Dublin) after the 1916 Easter Rising.JPG|left|thumb|Rubble in the streets of [[Dublin]] after the failed [[Easter Rising]] in 1916 against British rule]]

Shortly after the rebellion, [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] and others founded the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA), which from 1916 to 1923{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} carried out numerous attacks against symbols of British power. For example, it attacked over 300 police stations simultaneously just before Easter 1920,&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, p.185: "Just before Easter 1920, the IRA simultaneously attacked more than 300 police stations..."&lt;/ref&gt; and, in November 1920, publicly killed a dozen police officers and burned down the Liverpool docks and warehouses, an action that became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]].&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Peter. ''Mick: The Real Michael Collins''. p.241&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of warfare, London agreed to the 1921 Anglo-Irish treaty creating a free Irish state encompassing 26 of the island's 32 counties.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, Tim. ''Michael Collins: The Man Who Made Ireland.'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002. p.92&lt;/ref&gt; IRA tactics were an inspiration to other groups, including the [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine Mandate]]'s [[Zionism|Zionists]],&lt;ref name="Colin Shindler p.177"&gt;Colin Shindler, ''The Land Beyond Promise:Israel, Likud and the Zionist Dream'', I.B.Tauris, 2001 p.177&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Special Operations Executive|British special operations]] during World War II.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Hugh Dalton letter to Lord Halifax 2/7/1940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thefirstpost.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/5754,opinion,how-churchill-helped-britain-perfect-terrorism] article by Matthew Carr Author The Infernal Machine: A History of Terrorism {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081202161231/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/5754,opinion,how-churchill-helped-britain-perfect-terrorism |date= December 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRA are considered by some the innovators of modern terrorism as the British would replicate and build upon the tactics used against by the IRA in World War II. [[Tony Geraghty]] in ''The Irish War: The Hidden Conflict Between the IRA and British Intelligence'' wrote:

{{quote|The Irish [thanks to the example set by Collins and followed by the SOE] can thus claim that their resistance provide the originating impulse for resistance to tyrannies worse than any they had to endure themselves.

R. D. Foot]], who wrote several official histories of SOE}}

From January 1939 to March 1940, the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) carried out a campaign of bombing and [[sabotage]] against the civil, economic, and military infrastructure of Britain. It was known as the [[S-Plan|S-Plan or Sabotage Campaign]]. During the campaign, the IRA carried out almost 300 attacks and acts of sabotage in Britain, killing seven people and injuring 96.&lt;ref&gt;Dingley, James. ''The IRA: The Irish Republican Army''. ABC-CLIO, 2012. p.82&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the casualties occurred in the [[1939 Coventry bombing|Coventry bombing]] on 25 August 1939.

===Mandatory Palestine===
{{see also|Jewish insurgency in Palestine|1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|List of killings and massacres in Mandatory Palestine}}

Following the [[1929 Hebron massacre]] of 67 Jews in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], the [[Zionism|Zionist]] militia [[Haganah]] transformed itself into a paramilitary force. In 1931, however, the more militant [[Irgun]] broke away from Haganah, objecting to Haganah's policy of [[Havlagah|restraint]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard.

Operating in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] in the 1930s, [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]] (1882–1935) organized and established the [[Black Hand (Palestine)|Black Hand]], a Palestinian nationalist militia. He recruited and arranged military training for [[peasant]]s, and by 1935 had enlisted between 200 and 800 men. Al-Qassam obtained a [[fatwa]] from Shaykh Badr al-Din al-Taji al-Hasani, the [[Mufti]] of [[Damascus]], authorizing armed resistance against the British and against the Jews of Palestine. Black Hand cells were equipped with bombs and firearms, which they used to kill Jews.&lt;ref name=segev&gt;{{cite book |last= Segev |first= Tom |authorlink= Tom Segev |title= One Palestine, Complete |year= 1999 |publisher= Metropolitan Books |isbn= 0-8050-4848-0 |pages= 360–362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shai Lachman, "Arab Rebellion and Terrorism in Palestine 1929-39: The Case of Sheikh Izz al-Din al-Qassam and His Movement", in ''Zionism and Arabism in Palestine and Israel'', edited by Elie Kedourie and Sylvia G. Haim, Frank Cass, London, 1982, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Although al-Qassam's revolt was unsuccessful in his lifetime, many organizations gained inspiration from his example.&lt;ref name=segev/&gt; He became a popular hero and an inspiration to subsequent Arab militants, who in the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936{{ndash}}39 Arab revolt]], called themselves Qassamiyun, followers of al-Qassam. The [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]], the military wing of [[Hamas]], as well as the [[Qassam rocket|rockets]] they developed, take their names after Qassam.

[[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] (''Lohamei Herut Yisrael'', a.k.a. "Freedom Fighters for Israel", a.k.a. the Stern Gang) was a [[Revisionist Zionism|revisionist Zionist]] group that splintered off from [[Irgun]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=hoffman1998-26/&gt; [[Abraham Stern]] formed Lehi from disaffected Irgun members after Irgun agreed to a truce with Britain in 1940.&lt;ref name="Sachar, Howard 2007.

For example, on November 6, 1944, [[Lord Moyne]], the [[uK|British]] Minister of State for the Middle East, was assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. P. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; The act was controversial among Zionist militant groups, [[Hagannah]] sympathizing with the British and launching [[the Hunting Season|a massive man-hunt]] against members of Lehi and Irgun. After Israel's 1948 founding, Lehi formally dissolved and its members became integrated into the [[Israeli Defense Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;Pedahzur, Ami.

===Resistance during WWII===
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}
Some of the tactics of the [[Resistance during World War II|guerrilla, partisan, and resistance movements]] organised and supplied by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during [[World War II]], according to historian M. R. D. Foot, can be considered terrorist.&lt;ref&gt;Resistance - An Analysis of European Resistance to Nazism 1940–1945, by M. R. D. Foot&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Keegan as quoted in The Irish War, by Tony Geraghty&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin Gubbins]], a key leader within the British [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE), made sure the organization drew much of its inspiration from the IRA.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thefirstpost.co.uk"/&gt;

On the eve of [[Normandy landings|D-Day]], the [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] organised with the [[French Resistance]] the complete destruction of the rail&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/c-d/cross.html|title= Programmes - Most Popular - All 4|date= |work= Channel 4|accessdate= 27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and communication infrastructure of western France&lt;ref&gt;SOE in France. An Account of the Work of the British Special Operations Executive in France 1940–1944. By M. R. D. Foot (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; the largest coordinated attack of its kind in history&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Churchill's Secret Army, Carlton UK, Channel 4, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Allied supreme commander [[Dwight Eisenhower]] later wrote that "the disruption of enemy rail communications, the harassing of German road moves and the continual and increasing strain placed on German security services throughout occupied Europe by the organised forces of Resistance, played a very considerable part in our complete and final victory".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/soe_04.shtml] http://www.bbc.co.uk/news&lt;/ref&gt;

The SOE also conducted operations in Africa, the Middle East and the Far East.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The work of the SOE received recognition in 2009 with a memorial in London, however there are differing views on the morality of the SOE's actions; the British military historian [[John Keegan]] wrote:
{{quote|We must recognise that our response to the scourge of terrorism is compromised by what we did through SOE. The justification&amp;nbsp;... That we had no other means of striking back at the enemy&amp;nbsp;... is exactly the argument used by the Red Brigades, the Baader-Meinhoff gang, the PFLP, the IRA and every other half-articulate terrorist organisation on Earth. Futile to argue that we were a democracy and Hitler a tyrant. Means besmirch ends. SOE besmirched Britain.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Anti-colonial struggles (Cold War)==
After World War II, largely successful [[anti-imperialism|anti-colonial]] campaigns were launched against the collapsing European empires, as many World War II resistance groups became militantly anti-colonial. The [[Viet Minh]], for example, which had fought against the Japanese, now fought against the returning [[First Indochina War|French]] colonists. In the Middle East, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] used bombings and assassinations against British rule in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Lia, Brynjar 2006. p.53"/&gt; Also during the 1950s, the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) in French-controlled Algeria and the [[EOKA]] in British-controlled Cyprus waged [[guerrilla]] and open war against colonial powers.&lt;ref name="Hoffman, Bruce 1998. p. 33"&gt;Hoffman 1998, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1964 Brinks Hotel bombing.JPG|thumb|Aftermath of the [[1964 Brinks Hotel bombing]] in Vietnam.]]
In the 1960s, inspired by [[Mao Zedong|Mao's]] Chinese revolution of 1949 and [[Fidel Castro|Castro's]] [[Cuban revolution]] of 1959, national independence movements often fused nationalist and [[socialism|socialist]] impulses. This was the case with Spain's [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], the [[Front de libération du Québec]], and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]]{{Clarify|date=April 2009}}.&lt;ref name="Chaliand, Gerard 2007. p.227"&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. p.227&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s and 1970s violent [[left-wing politics|left wing]] and revolutionary groups were on the rise, sympathizing with [[Third World]] guerrilla movements and seeking to spark anti-capitalist revolts. Such groups included the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] in Turkey{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}, Armenia's [[ASALA]],&lt;ref name="Chaliand, Gerard 2007. p.227"/&gt; the [[Japanese Red Army]], the [[German Red Army Faction]], the [[Italian Red Brigades]], and, in the United States, the [[Weather Underground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terrorism.about.com/od/originshistory/a/LeftWingTerror.htm|title=Where Did Left Wing Terrorism Go?|author=Amy Zalman|date=|work=About.com News &amp; Issues|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalist groups such as the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] and the [[Tamil tigers]] also began operations at this time.

Throughout the [[Cold War]], both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] made extensive use of violent nationalist organizations to carry on a war by proxy. For example, Soviet and Chinese military advisers provided training and support to the [[Viet Cong]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam: A History, Stanley Karnow,1983&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union also provided military support to the [[PLO]] during the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/12/how-the-soviet-union-transformed-terrorism How the Soviet Union Transformed Terrorism]/250433/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fidel Castro]] during the [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/98822/Fidel-Castro|title=Fidel Castro|date=|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States funded groups such as the [[Contras]] in Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/PS157/assignment%20files%20public/TOWER%20EXCERPTS.htm|title=Tower Commission Report Excerpts|date=|work=ucsb.edu|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Islamic Terrorism|violent Islamic militants]] of the late 20th and early 21st century had been funded in the 1980s by the United States and the UK because they were fighting the USSR in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;''The Power of Nightmares'', BBC, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crile|first=George|title=Charlie Wilson's War|publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press |year=2004|pages=111–112|isbn=0-8021-4124-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1928 as a nationalist social-welfare and political movement in British-controlled Egypt, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] began to attack British soldiers and police stations in the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Lia, Brynjar.

RAND Corporation Press, 2006. P. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The FLN was one of the first anti-colonial groups to use large-scale compliance violence. The FLN would establish control over a rural village and coerce its peasants to execute any French loyalists among them.&lt;ref name="Hoffman, Bruce 1998. p. 33"/&gt; On the night of October 31, 1954, in a coordinated wave of seventy bombings and shootings known as the [[Toussaint attacks]], the FLN attacked French military installations and the homes of Algerian loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;Chaliand, Gerard. ''The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to al Qaeda''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007. P. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, the group gained significant support for an uprising against loyalists in [[Philippeville]]. This uprising, and the heavy-handed response by the French, convinced many Algerians to support the FLN and the independence movement.{{Citation needed|date= March 2009}} The FLN eventually secured Algerian independence from France in 1962, and transformed itself into Algeria's ruling party.&lt;ref&gt;Millar, S.N.

The [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF) was a [[New Left]] group founded in 1968 by [[Andreas Baader]] and [[Ulrike Meinhof]] in West Germany. Inspired by [[Che Guevara]], Maoist socialism, and the [[Vietcong]], the group sought to raise awareness of the Vietnamese and Palestinian independence movements through kidnappings, taking embassies hostage, bank robberies, assassinations, bombings, and attacks on U.S. air bases. The group is best known for 1977's "[[German Autumn]]". The buildup leading to [[German Autumn]] began on April 7, when the RAF shot Federal Prosecutor [[Siegfried Buback]]. On July 30, it shot [[Jürgen Ponto]], then head of the Dresdner Bank, in a failed kidnapping attempt; on September 5, the group kidnapped [[Hanns Martin Schleyer]] (a former SS officer and an important West German industrialist), executing him on October 19.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenau, Bernhard.

The [[Red Brigades]] were a New Left group founded by [[Renato Curcio]] and [[Alberto Franceschini]] in 1970 that sought to create a revolutionary state. The group carried out a series of bombings and kidnappings until Curcio and Franceschini were arrested in the mid-1970s. Their successor as leader, [[Mario Moretti]], led the group toward more militarized and violent actions, including the kidnapping of former Prime Minister [[Aldo Moro]] on March 16, 1978. Moro was killed 56 days later. This led to an all-out assault on the group by Italian law enforcement and security forces and condemnation from Italian left-wing radicals and even imprisoned ex-leaders of the Brigades. The group lost most of its social support and public opinion turned strongly against it. In 1984, the group split, the majority faction becoming the Communist Combatant Party (Red Brigades-PCC) and the minority faction reconstituting itself as the Union of Combatant Communists (Red Brigades-UCC). Members of these groups carried out a handful of assassinations before almost all were arrested in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ed Vulliamy]], [http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/vinciguerra.p2.etc_graun_5dec1990.html Secret agents, freemasons, fascists... and a top-level campaign of political 'destabilisation'], ''[[The Guardian]]'', December 5, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Laporte was killed a week later. After these events support for violence in order to attain Quebec's independence declined, and support increased for the Parti Québécois, which took power in Quebec in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/front-de-liberation-du-quebec/ Front de libération du Québec].

The [[Weather Underground]] (a.k.a. the Weathermen) began as a militant faction of the leftist [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) organization, and in 1969 took over the organization. Weathermen leaders, inspired by China's [[Maoism|Maoists]], the [[Black Panthers]], and the [[May 1968 in France|1968 student revolts in France]], sought to raise awareness of its revolutionary anti-capitalist and anti-[[Vietnam War]] platform by destroying symbols of government power.

===Africa===
In Kenya, because of the seeming ongoing failure of the Kenyan African Union to obtain political reforms from the British through peaceful means, radical activists within the KAU set up a splinter group and organised a more militant kind of nationalism. By 1952 The Mau Mau consisted of Kikuyu fighters, along with some Embu and Meru recruits. The Mau Mau carried out attacks on political opponents, loyalist villages, raiding white settler farms and destroying livestock. The British colonial administration declared a state of emergency and British forces were sent to Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1952/oct/21/mau-mau-terrorism-in-kenya|title=MAU MAU TERRORISM IN KENYA|date=|work=millbanksystems.com|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of fighting was between loyalist and Mau Mau Kikuyu, so many scholars today now consider it a Kikuyu civil war.

This period also saw the rise of what is sometimes categorized as [[Single issue terrorism]]. If terrorism is the extension of domestic politics by other means, just as war is for diplomacy, then this represents the extension of [[pressure groups]] into violent action. Notable examples that grow in this period are [[Anti-abortion terrorism]] and [[Environmental terrorism]].

[[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] (a.k.a. ''[[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya|Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiyya]]'') is a militant Egyptian [[Islamist]] movement dedicated to the establishment of an [[Islamic republic|Islamic state]] in Egypt. The group was formed in 1980 as an umbrella organization for militant student groups which were formed after the leadership of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] renounced violence. It is led by [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]], who has been accused of participation in the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. In 1981, the group assassinated Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]]. On November 17, 1997, in what became known as the [[Luxor massacre]], it attacked tourists at the Temple of [[Hatshepsut]] ([[Deir el-Bahri]]); six men dressed as police officers machine-gunned 58 Japanese and European vacationers and four Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Lawrence, ''Looming Tower'', Knopf, 2006, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Moscow theatre hostage crisis]] was the seizure of a crowded [[Moscow]] theatre on 23 October 2002 by some 40 to 50 armed [[Chechen people|Chechens]] who claimed allegiance to the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Islamist militant separatist movement in Chechnya]]. They took 850 hostages and demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from [[Chechnya]] and an end to the [[Second Chechen War]]. The siege was officially led by [[Movsar Barayev]].

On September 1, 2004, in what became known as the [[Beslan school hostage crisis]], 32 Chechen separatists took 1,300 children and adults hostage at [[Beslan]]'s School Number One. When Russian authorities did not comply with the rebel demands that Russian forces withdraw from Chechnya, 20 adult male hostages were shot. After two days of stalled negotiations, Russian special forces stormed the building. In the ensuing melee, over 300 hostages died, along with 19 Russian servicemen and all but perhaps one of the rebels.

It was concluded that the bombs were carried on the trains hidden in backpacks, While many went off three were found later that did not detonate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/terrorists-bomb-trains-in-madrid|title=Terrorists bomb trains in Madrid - Mar 11, 2004 - HISTORY.com|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official investigation by the Spanish judiciary found that the attacks were directed by an al-Qaeda-inspired terrorist cell.

The [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] (often referred to as 7/7) were a series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks in central London which targeted civilians using the public transport system during the morning rush hour. On the morning of Thursday, 7 July 2005, four Islamist extremists separately detonated three bombs in quick succession aboard London Underground trains across the city and, later, a fourth on a double-decker bus in Tavistock Square. Fifty-two civilians were killed and over 700 more were injured in the attacks. Later a dozen unexploded bombs were found in a car located in North London. 3 out of the 4 suspects were identified Mohammed Silique Khan, Germaine Morris Lindsay, Shahzad Tawnier where they are found to be in cohorts with Osama Bin Laden and eventually documents are leaked showing that Osama bin laden and Rashid Ruff planned the London bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/06/world/europe/july-7-2005-london-bombings-fast-facts/|title=July 7 2005 London Bombings Fast Facts|first=CNN|last=Library|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway in 2011 two sequential lone wolf terrorist attacks by right-wing extremist Anders Behring Breivik were carried out against the government, the civilian population, and a Workers' Youth League (AUF)-run summer camp in Norway on 22 July 2011. The attacks claimed a total of 77 lives. The first part of the attack was a van bomb in Oslo. The van was placed in front of the office block housing the office of Prime Minister and other government buildings. The explosion killed eight people and injured at least 209 people, twelve of them seriously. He followed this attack by impersonating a police officer to access the island on which the AUF summer camp was being held and proceeded to go on a shooting spree that killed 69 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/07/29/norway.attacks/|title=Norway honors victims of terrorist attacks|date=|work=cnn.com|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the British government branded the [[murder of Lee Rigby|killing of a serviceman]] in a [[Woolwich]] street, a terrorist attack. One of his attackers made political statements which were later broadcast with blood still on his hands from the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2013-05-22/exclusive-video-man-with-bloodied-hands-speaks-at-woolwich-scene/|title=Exclusive video: Man with bloodied hands speaks at Woolwich scene|date=|work=ITV News|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two men responsible for the attack remained on the scene until incapacitated by armed police.

On 13 November, 28 hours after the [[2015 Beirut bombings|Beirut attack]], three groups of ISIS terrorists performed mass killings in various places in Paris' Xe and XIe arrondissements. They killed a total of more than 130 citizens.

On March 22, 2016 yet another terrorist attack happened within the confines of Europe. Three nail bombs went off at the same time in Belgium, two happened at Brussels Airport in Zaventem approximately 40 seconds apart. The other nail bomb was at Maalbeck metro station also in Brussels about an hour after the airport attacks The act was carried out by 3 suicide bombers, killing 31 people and injuring 300 people in the process. The three men were claimed as members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria known as ISIS.  The third nail bomb at the metro station failed to explode during the terrorist act that Tuesday and was safely deactivated. The two men who hit the Brussels Airport were brothers Ibrahim El Bakraoui and Khalid El Bakraoui while a third person was with them  Najim Laachraoui who was believed to be the bomb maker also died, the suspect who had the bomb at the metro station has not yet been identified. The Brothers were both killed during the explosions along with the bomb maker, while the unidentified terrorist fled for he had the bomb that did not explode in the metro station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/03/23/belgian-state-tv-names-brussels-attack-suspects/82153446/|title=One 35-pound bomb in Brussels attack failed to go off; suicide note found|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brussels responded to this attack with a level 4 alert the highest it had had since the Paris attacks mentioned above. World leaders responded by unifying and offering their aid along with sorrows for the tragedy that happened there on March 22, 2016. 28 heads of state in the European union agreed to fight the War on Terror to better and protect the Union.

The United States responded to the attacks by launching the [[War on Terror]]. Specifically, on October 7, 2001, it invaded Afghanistan to depose [[the Taliban]], which had harbored al-Qaeda terrorists. On October 26, 2001, the U.S. enacted the [[USA PATRIOT Act|Patriot Act]] that expanded the powers of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Many countries followed with similar legislation. Under the Obama administration, the U.S. changed tactics moving away from ground combat with large numbers of troops, to the use of drones and special forces. This campaign eliminated much of al-Qaeda's most senior members, including a strike by [[Seal Team Six]] that resulted in the death of Osama Bin Laden in 2011.

As the Islamic state of Syria and Iraq increases in size and power their attacks are affecting all parts of the world even in their own back yard of Turkey. Taking place in [[Istanbul]] a suicide bomber once again detonated a car bomb killing 4 people and injuring 31. No extremist group took responsibility for the attack but the attacker Mehmet Ozturk was linked to have ties with ISIS. This was just days after the car bomb attack in Turkeys capital of Ankara killing 37 people. The U.S. security council asked for the repeated terror attacks on Turkey to stop, and that the War on Terror will just become stronger due actions like these killing innocent people. Since the attacks Israel has requested that its citizens not travel to Turkey unless its necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/20/europe/turkey-blast/|title=Istanbul bomber had ISIS links, minister says|first=Gul Tuysuz, Faith Karimi and Greg Botelho,|last=CNN|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 27, 2007 two time elected Pakistani Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] was assassinated during a gathering she was having with her supporters. A suicide bomber detonated a bomb along with other extremists against her shooting off guns killing the prime minister and 14 other people. She was immediately rushed to the hospital and was pronounced dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/12/27/pakistan.sharif/|title=Benazir Bhutto assassinated - CNN.com|website=www.cnn.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was believed to be target because she was warning Pakistan along with the world of the uprising [[Jihadist]] groups and extremist groups gaining power. The responsibility of her death falls on the president of the time [[Pervez Musharraf]] who also was the ex- military chief, She had several conversations with Musharraf about upping her security due to the increase of death threats she was receiving and he denied her request. Although AL-Qaeda took responsibility for her death it is seen in the eye of the people as former President's Pervez Musharraf's fault for not taking her concerns seriously. However, during his trial he denies that no conversation happened between him and Benzair Bhutto about the security of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/benazir-bhutto-assassination-case-musharraf-responsible-pakistan-prime-ministers-2145412|title=Benazir Bhutto Assassination Case: Musharraf Responsible For Pakistan Prime Minister's Death, Witness Siegel Claims|date=17 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2008 Mumbai attacks]] were more than ten coordinated shooting and bombing attacks across [[Mumbai]], India's largest city, by [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]], a Pakistani [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorist]] organization with ties to [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]], Pakistan's secret service. The six main targets were 
# Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus – formerly known as Victoria Station
# The Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel – six explosions were reported in the hotel,200 hostages were rescued from the burning building. A group of European Parliament committee members were staying at the hotel at the time but none were injured. Two attackers held hostages in the hotel. 
# Leopold Café – a popular cafe and bar on the Causeway that was one of the first places to be attacked resulting in the death of 10 people
# The Trident-Oberoi Hotel – one explosion was heard here where the President of Madrid was eating, he was not injured
# Nariman House, a Jewish community center – had a hostage situation by two attackers eventually the hostages became freed when an aerial view of the building was displayed and NSG's stormed the building eventually killing the two attackers.
# Cama Hospital – the attacks were carried out by 10 gunman that arrived on speed boats boat from Pakistan, separating going building to building grabbing hostages, setting bombs up and mass murdering with guns. Eventually 9 out of the 10 gunman were killed. Pakistan denied that the men were a part of their country but eventually released documents that 3 of the men were from Pakistan and that cases would be opened against them&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/mumbai-massacre-background-information/502/|title=Mumbai Massacre - Background Information - Secrets of the Dead - PBS|date=24 November 2009|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2016 a series of terrorist attacks took place in [[Jakarta, Indonesia]] resulting in 8 dead. The responsibility of these attacks were claimed by ISIS Counter terrorism has named this type of attack 'Marauding Terrorist Firearms Attack' because of the fast reaction needed by local policemen to stop the gunfire attack from the terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35309195,&lt;/ref&gt; The attack on Jakarta is linked to a bigger picture of terror in the Indonesian country for those of ISIS. Indonesia is home of the "largest regional terror groups" housing seven Islamist extremist groups. Leaving the thoughts that ISIS is trying to establish a satellite city in Indonesia, due to the fact that it has the largest Muslim population. Although ISIS branches have not yet reached the land of Southeast Asia in big masses, there is the fear that it is only a matter of time until Indonesias small extremist groups grow in masses once direct contact with ISIS is made. Once contact is established [[local terror groups]] will quickly mobilize to carry out the tasks that ISIS asks of them. ISIS will turn to Southeast Asia because it is only evident that they will lose control of the middle east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atimes.com/2016/01/jakarta-terror-attacks-will-parts-of-southeast-asia-become-isis-satellite-cities/|title=Jakarta terror attacks: Will parts of Southeast Asia become ISIS’ satellite cities?|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===
2001 also saw the second acknowledged act of [[bioterrorism]] with the [[2001 anthrax attacks]] (the first being [[1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack|intentional food poisoning]] conducted in [[The Dalles, Oregon]] by [[Rajneesh movement|Rajneeshee]] followers in 1984), when letters carrying anthrax spores were posted to several major American media outlets and two [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politicians. This resulted in several of the first fatalities attributed to a bioterror attack.

The more recent terrorist attack in the United States have included the [[2015 San Bernardino attack]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/06/us/san-bernardino-shooter-tashfeen-malik/|title=Tashfeen Malik, the San Bernardino shooter: Who was she? - CNN|first=Pat St. Claire, Greg Botelho and Ralph Ellis,|last=CNN|publisher=|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bombing of Boston Marathon by Islamic terrorists, the shooting of police officers in sniper ambushes by members of Black Lives Matter movement, and the shooting of multiple black parishioners at church and car attack on anti-fascist protesters in Charlottesville by right-wing extremists and white supremacists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18649">The [[type theory]] was initially created to avoid paradoxes in a variety of formal [[mathematical logic|logic]]s and [[rewrite system]]s.  Later, type theory referred to a class of [[formal systems]], some of which can serve as alternatives to [[naive set theory]] as a foundation for all mathematics.

It has been tied to formal mathematics since ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' to today's [[proof assistant]]s.

== 1900–1927 ==

=== Origin of Russell's theory of types ===

In a letter to [[Gottlob Frege]] (1902) Russell announced his discovery of the paradox in Frege's [[Begriffsschrift]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell's (1902) ''Letter to Frege'' appears, with commentary, in van Heijenoort 1967:124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; Frege promptly responded, acknowledging the problem and proposing a solution in a technical discussion of "levels". To quote Frege:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Incidentally, it seems to me that the expression "a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] is predicated of itself" is not exact. A predicate is as a rule a first-level function, and this function requires an object as argument and cannot have itself as argument (subject). Therefore I would prefer to say "a concept is predicated of its own extension".&lt;ref&gt;Frege (1902) ''Letter to Russell'' appears, with commentary, in van Heijenoort 1967:126–128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He goes about showing how this might work but seems to pull back from it. &lt;!--(In a footnote, van Heijenoort notes that Frege, in his ''Grundgesetze der Arithmetik'' (1893), had used the symbol ∩ "for reducing second-level functions to first-level functions"&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:128&lt;/ref&gt;).--&gt; As a consequence of what has become known as [[Russell's paradox]] both Frege and Russell had to quickly amend works that they had at the printers. In an Appendix B that Russell tacked onto his ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903) one finds his "tentative" theory of types. The matter plagued Russell for about five years.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Quine's commentary before Russell (1908) ''Mathematical Logic as based on the theory of types'' in van Heijenoort 1967:150&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willard Quine]]&lt;ref&gt;cf. commentary by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] before Russell's (1908) ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types'' in van Hiejenoort 1967:150–153&lt;/ref&gt; presents a historical synopsis of the origin of the theory of types and the "ramified" theory of types: after considering abandoning the theory of types (1905), Russell proposed in turn three theories:
{{ordered list|list_style_type=lower-roman
| the zigzag theory
| theory of limitation of size,
| the no-class theory (1905–1906) and then,
| readopting the theory of types (1908ff)
}}

Quine observes that Russell's introduction of the notion of "apparent variable" had the following result:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the distinction between 'all' and 'any': 'all' is expressed by the bound ('apparent') variable of universal quantification, which ranges over a type, and 'any' is expressed by the free ('real') variable which refers schematically to any unspecified thing irrespective of type.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quine dismisses this notion of "bound variable" as "''pointless apart from a certain aspect of the theory of types''".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Quine's commentary before Russell (1908) ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types'' in van Heijenoort 1967:151&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 1908 "ramified" theory of types ===

Quine explains the ''ramified'' theory as follows: "It has been so called because the type of a function depends both on the types of its arguments and on the types of the apparent variables contained in it (or in its expression), in case these exceed the types of the arguments".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Stephen Kleene]] in his 1952 ''Introduction to Metamathematics'' describes the ''ramified'' theory of types this way:

:The primary objects or individuals (i.e. the given things not being subjected to logical analysis) are assigned to one type (say ''type 0''), the properties of individuals to ''type 1'', properties of properties of individuals to ''type 2'', etc.; and no properties are admitted which do not fall into one of these logical types (e.g. this puts the properties 'predicable' and 'impredicable' ... outside the pale of logic). A more detailed account would describe the admitted types for other objects as relations and classes. Then to exclude [[impredicativity|impredicative]] definitions within a type, the types above type 0 are further separated into orders. Thus for type 1, properties defined without mentioning any totality belong to ''order 0'', and properties defined using the totality of properties of a given order belong to the next higher order. ... But this separation into orders makes it impossible to construct the familiar analysis, which we saw above contains impredicative definitions. To escape this outcome, Russell postulated his ''[[axiom of reducibility]]'', which asserts that to any property belonging to an order above the lowest, there is a coextensive property (i.e. one possessed by exactly the same objects) of order 0. If only definable properties are considered to exist, then the axiom means that to every impredicative definition within a given type there is an equivalent predicative one (Kleene 1952:44–45).

=== The axiom of reducibility and the notion of "matrix" ===

But because the stipulations of the ramified theory would prove (to quote Quine) "onerous", Russell in his 1908 ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types''&lt;ref&gt;Russell (1908) ''Mathematical Logic as based on the theory of types'' in van Heijenoort 1967:153–182&lt;/ref&gt; also would propose his ''[[axiom of reducibility]]''. By 1910 Whitehead and Russell in their ''Principia Mathematica'' would further augment this axiom with the notion of a '' matrix '' — a fully extensional specification of a function. From its matrix a function could be derived by the process of "generalization" and vice versa, i.e. the two processes are reversible — (i) generalization from a matrix to a function (by using apparent variables) and (ii) the reverse process of reduction of type by courses-of-values substitution of arguments for the apparent variable. By this method impredicativity could be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;cf. in particular p. 51 in Chapter II ''The theory of Logical Types'' and *12 ''The Hierarchy of Types and the Axiom of Reducibility'' pp. 162–167. Whitehead and Russell (1910–1913, 1927 2nd edition) ''Principia Mathematica''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Truth tables ===

Eventually [[Emil Post]] (1921) would lay waste to Russell's "cumbersome"&lt;ref&gt;Post (1921) ''Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions'' in van Heijenoort 1967:264–283, in particular p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of Types with his "truth functions" and their truth tables. In his "Introduction" to his 1921 Post places the blame on Russell's notion of apparent variable: "Whereas the complete theory [of Whitehead and Russell (1910, 1912, 1913)] requires for the enunciation of its propositions real and apparent variables, which represent both individuals and [[propositional function]]s of different kinds, and as a result necessitates the cumbersome theory of types, this subtheory uses only real variables, and these real variables represent but one kind of entity, which the authors have chosen to call elementary propositions".

At about the same time [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] made short work of the theory of types in his 1922 work [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]] in which he points out the following in parts 3.331–3.333:

{{quote|3.331 From this observation we get a further view – into Russell's Theory of Types. Russell's error is shown by the fact that in drawing up his symbolic rules he has to speak of the meanings of his signs.

3.332 No proposition can say anything about itself, because the propositional sign cannot be contained in itself (that is the whole "theory of types").

3.333 A function cannot be its own argument, because the functional sign already contains the prototype of its own argument and it cannot contain itself...}}

Wittgenstein proposed the truth-table method as well. In his 4.3 through 5.101, Wittgenstein adopts an unbounded [[Sheffer stroke]] as his fundamental logical entity and then lists all 16 functions of two variables (5.101).

The notion of matrix-as-truth-table appears as late as the 1940–1950s in the work of Tarski, e.g. his 1946 indexes "Matrix, see: Truth table"&lt;ref&gt;Tarski 1946, ''Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences'', Dover republication 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russell's doubts ===

Russell in his 1920 ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'' devotes an entire chapter to "The axiom of Infinity and logical types" wherein he states his concerns: "Now the theory of types emphatically does not belong to the finished and certain part of our subject: much of this theory is still inchoate, confused, and obscure. But the need of ''some'' doctrine of types is less doubtful than the precise form the doctrine should take; and in connection with the axiom of infinity it is particularly easy to see the necessity of some such doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1920:135&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russell abandons the axiom of reducibility''': In the second edition of ''Principia Mathematica'' (1927) he acknowledges Wittgenstein's argument.&lt;ref&gt;cf. "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xiv and Appendix C&lt;/ref&gt; At the outset of his Introduction he declares "there can be no doubt ... that there is no need of the distinction between real and apparent variables...".&lt;ref&gt;cf. "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:i&lt;/ref&gt; Now he fully embraces the matrix notion and declares "A ''function can only appear in a matrix through its values''" (but demurs in a footnote: "It takes the place (not quite adequately) of the axiom of reducibility"&lt;ref&gt;cf. "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xxix&lt;/ref&gt;). Furthermore, he introduces a new (abbreviated, generalized) notion of "matrix", that of a "logical matrix . . . one that contains no constants. Thus ''p''|''q'' is a logical matrix".&lt;ref&gt;The vertical bar " | " is the Sheffer stroke; cf. "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Russell has virtually abandoned the axiom of reducibility,&lt;ref&gt;"The theory of classes is at once simplified in one direction and complicated in another by the assumption that functions only occur through their values and by the abandonment of the axiom of reducibility"; cf. "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xxxix&lt;/ref&gt; but in his last paragraphs he states that from "our present primitive propositions" he cannot derive "Dedekindian relations and well-ordered relations" and observes that if there is a new axiom to replace the axiom of reducibility "it remains to be discovered".&lt;ref&gt;These quotes from "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xliv–xlv.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of simple types ===
In the 1920s, [[Leon Chwistek]]&lt;ref&gt;L. Chwistek, Antynomje logikiformalnej, ''Przeglad Filozoficzny'' 24 (1921) 164–171&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frank P. Ramsey]]&lt;ref&gt;F. P. Ramsey, The foundations of mathematics, ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society'', Series 2 25 (1926) 338–384.&lt;/ref&gt; noticed that, if one is willing to give up the [[vicious circle principle]],
the hierarchy of levels of types in the "ramified theory of types" can be collapsed.

The resulting restricted logic is called the theory of simple types&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1944, pages 126 and 136–138, footnote 17: "Russell's mathematical logic" appearing in ''Kurt Gödel: Collected Works: Volume II Publications 1938–1974'', Oxford University Press, New York NY, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514721-6}}(v.2.pbk).&lt;/ref&gt; or, perhaps more commonly, simple type theory.&lt;ref&gt;This does not mean the theory is "simple", it means that the theory is ''restricted'': types of different orders are not to be mixed: "Mixed types (such as classes containing individuals and classes as elements) and therefore also transfinite types (such as the class of all classes of finite types) are excluded." Gödel 1944, pages 127, footnote 17: "Russell's mathematical logic" appearing in ''Kurt Gödel: Collected Works: Volume II Publications 1938–1974'', Oxford University Press, New York NY, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514721-6}}(v.2.pbk).&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed formulations of simple type theory were published in the late 1920s and early 1930s
by R. Carnap, F. Ramsey, W.V.O. Quine, and A. Tarski. In 1940 [[Alonzo Church]] (re)formulated it as [[simply typed lambda calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Church, A formulation of the simple theory of types, Journal of Symbolic Logic 5 (1940) 56–68.&lt;/ref&gt; and examined by Gödel in 1944. A survey of these developments is found in Collins (2012).&lt;ref&gt;J. Collins, A History of the Theory of Types: Developments after the Second Edition of 'Principia Mathematica'. LAP Lambert Academic Publishing (2012). {{ISBN|978-3-8473-2963-3}}, esp. chs. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1940s–present ===
&lt;!--&gt;Quine reports that Ramsey 1931 urged the "dropping of the ramification and the axiom of reducibility"; Quine opines that "Russell's failure [was] due to this failure to distinguish between propositional functions as notations and propositional functions as attributes and relations.[Quine's commentary before Russell 1908 in van Heijenoort 1967:151–152]."&lt;/!--&gt;

==== Gödel 1944 ====
[[Kurt Gödel]] in his 1944 ''Russell's mathematical logic'' gave the following definition of the "theory of simple types" in a footnote:
:By the theory of simple types I mean the doctrine which says that the objects of thought (or, in another interpretation, the symbolic expressions) are divided into types, namely: individuals, properties of individuals, relations between individuals, properties of such relations, etc. (with a similar hierarchy for extensions), and that sentences of the form: " ''a'' has the property ''φ'' ", " ''b'' bears the relation ''R'' to ''c'' ", etc. are meaningless, if ''a, b, c, R, φ'' are not of types fitting together. Mixed types (such as classes containing individuals and classes as elements) and therefore also transfinite types (such as the class of all classes of finite types) are excluded. That the theory of simple types suffices for avoiding also the epistemological paradoxes is shown by a closer analysis of these. (Cf. ''Ramsey 1926'' and ''Tarski 1935'', p. 399).".&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1944:126 footnote 17: "Russell's mathematical logic" appearing in ''Kurt Gödel: Collected Works: Volume II Publications 1938–1974'', Oxford University Press, New York NY, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514721-6}}(v.2.pbk).&lt;/ref&gt;

He concluded the (1) theory of simple types and (2) axiomatic set theory, "permit the derivation of modern mathematics and at the same time avoid all known paradoxes" (Gödel 1944:126); furthermore, the theory of simple types "is the system of the first ''Principia'' [''Principia Mathematica''] in an appropriate interpretation. . . . [M]any symptoms show only too clearly, however, that the primitive concepts need further elucidation" (Gödel 1944:126).

==== Curry–Howard correspondence, 1934–1969 ====
The [[Curry–Howard correspondence]] is the interpretation of proofs-as-programs and formulae-as-types.  The idea starting in 1934 with [[Haskell Curry]] and finalized in 1969 with [[William Alvin Howard]].  It connected the "computational component" of many type theories to the derivations in logics.

Howard showed that the typed lambda calculus corresponded to intuitionistic [[natural deduction]].  (That is, natural deduction without the [[Law of excluded middle]].)  The connection between types and logic lead to a lot of subsequent research to find new type theories for existing logics and new logics for existing type theories.

==== de Bruijn's AUTOMATH, 1967–2003 ====
[[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn]] created the type theory [[Automath]] as a mathematical foundation for the Automath system, which could verify the correctness of proofs.  The system developed and added features over time as type theory developed.

==== Martin-Löf's Intuitionistic type theory, 1971–1984 ====
[[Per Martin-Löf]] found a type theory that corresponded to [[predicate logic]] by introducing [[dependent types]], which became known as [[intuitionistic type theory]] or Martin-Löf type theory.

Martin-Löf's theory uses inductive types to represent unbounded data structures, such as natural numbers.

==== Barendregt's lambda cube, 1991 ====
The [[lambda cube]] was not a new type theory but a categorization of existing type theories.  The eight corners of the cube included some existing theories with [[simply typed lambda calculus]] at the lowest corner and the [[calculus of constructions]] at the highest.

[[Image:Greek hoplite.png|right|thumb|A Greek hoplite, armed with spear and shield]]
'''Hoplology''' is a science that studies human combative behavior and performance.

==Etymology and history of the term==
The word ''hoplology'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] terms ''hoplos'' (a mythical plate-armored animal) and ὅπλον ''hóplon'', a wooden shield carried by some warriors in ancient Greece.  The word ''[[hoplite]]'', derived from ''hoplon'', is the term for the classical Greek [[warrior]] who carried such a shield. The field originates in the 19th century with [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]]; although the origin of the word is often attributed to Burton, there are earlier references to it.&lt;ref name="hacc1" /&gt;  Despite the work of Burton and a few others, it was not until the 1960s that hoplology took shape as an academic field of study under the leadership of [[Donn F. Draeger]].&lt;ref name="hacc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoplology.com/articles_detail.asp?id=9|title=Hoplology and Combative Culture: Part 1|accessdate=2009-03-07|last=Wiley|first=Mark V.|publisher=The International Hoplology Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoplology was at some time defined as the science of "arms and weapons of offense and defence, human and bestial" (Burton, 1884),&lt;ref&gt;Richard Francis Burton - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MGmbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=History+of+swords&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMI6e-j2pL8xgIVAu8UCh2lYglG#v=onepage&amp;q=History%20of%20swords&amp;f=false The Book of the Sword: A History of Daggers, Sabers, and Scimitars from Ancient Times to the Modern Day - 7th page of ''Chapter 1 - Preamble: on the Origin of Weapons''] published by [[Skyhorse Publishing]], Inc. 20 November 2013, 336 pages, {{ISBN|1628738472}} [Retrieved 2015-07-27]&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently as "the study of the basis, patterns, relationships, and significances of combative behavior at all levels of social complexity" (Draeger, 1982).&lt;ref name="hoplology.com"&gt;International Hoplology Society - [http://www.hoplology.com/about.htm home-page] published by the International Hoplology Society, Inc. 1998-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Sid Campbell, a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] level, [[tenth dan]]-ranked in [[karate]], defines hoplology as "the study of the evolution and development of human combatitive behaviour and performance ... the study of how people fight, why they fight, and how different cultures manifest those behaviours."&lt;ref&gt;Sid Campbell - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZHdRcezT3bwC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=hoplology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgeahUKEwitmv7B2YHHAhVC1hQKHUIMDg8#v=onepage&amp;q=hoplology&amp;f=false Warrior Arts and Weapons of Ancient Hawai'i] Blue Snake Books 2006, 266 pages, {{ISBN|1583941606}} [Retrieved 2015-07-30]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The International Hoplology Society==
Founded by Major Donn F. Draeger (USMC Ret.) (1922-1982), the International Hoplology Society ("IHS") exists to study the evolution and development of human combative behavior. Draeger had prior research and personal experience of classical fighting systems.

Draeger's student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, carries on the hoplological tradition as director of IHS. He is a leading authority on combative behavior and performance. He has trained in numerous Asian and Western martial arts from a young age. He has spent a lifetime studying hoplology and related areas, including functional conditioning for combat. He currently trains military and law enforcement around the world in these areas. He works closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]] (MCMAP).

In recent years, with the advent of the [[Modern Army Combatives]] (MAC) Program in the [[US Army]] and the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP), there has been a rapid growth in both scientific and academic research. With [[Matt Larsen]], the father of the MAC program, as a catalyst, research departments are growing at universities across the United States. One of the first such programs was at [[Kansas State University]]; the program is currently defunct.&lt;ref&gt;The Collegian - [http://www.kstatecollegian.com/news/modern-combatives-program-cancelled-due-to-budget-concerns-1.2165227 Modern combatives program cancelled due to budget concerns] published by The Collegian Feb 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Hoplology encompasses the segment of human culture concerned with weapons, armor, combative accouterments and fighting systems, in regard to their technical characteristics and the ways in which they interact with the economic, political, social and religious institutions of human societies, and  has three main research areas: technological, functional, and behavioral.

* Technological hoplology studies the development of weapons, armor, and other combative tools in relation to the contexts in which they are created.
*Functional hoplology delves into the structure, development, and organization of combative systems and their relationship to the application of fighting and weapons.
* Behavioral hoplology encompasses the psychological and physiological factors that affect human’s combative behavior and development of combative capabilities such as weapons or fighting systems. The broad subject range of behavioral hoplology means it also includes the effects that culture has had on man’s evolution as a group-social animal.

There are three widely accepted axioms in hoplological studies.&lt;ref name="hoplology.com"/&gt;

* human combative behavior is rooted in man’s [[Human evolution|evolution]]. 
* humans exhibit two types of aggression: affective aggression and predatory aggression. Both forms evolved from different survival needs as both a group-social animal and as a hunting animal. 
* the evolution of human combative behavior is directly linked to the use of weapons. That is to say that the use of weapons is linked with and reflects combative performance and behavior.

A variation on the pragmatics of hoplological understanding is found in theatrical representations of combat.&lt;ref name="Meron Langsner"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dMUXQMBPyq4C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=hoplology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBmoVChMI7uLa-eaKxwIVSNEUCh0JCAfT#v=onepage&amp;q=hoplology&amp;f=false|author=Meron Langsner|title=Text &amp; Presentation, 2006|publisher=McFarland, 5 Feb 2007, 260 pages, (edited by Stratos E. Constantinidi), {{ISBN|0786455411}}, ''Volume 3 of The Comparative Drama Conference Series''|accessdate=2015-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While hoplology is still in its infancy, it has become an accepted area of study by scholars in several related disciplines such as [[combative psychology]], [[killology]], [[anthropology]], and [[military history]].

==The hoplological view on violence==
The entrenched nature of violence in human behavior is generally well understood. The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side "…the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy." (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006.

'''Human shields''' may be civilians used against their will to deter attacks on military targets during an international armed conflict or they may be civilians who voluntarily protect either military or civilian targets from attack. The use of human shields is forbidden by ''[[Protocol I]]'' of the [[Geneva Conventions]]. It is also a [[specific intent]] [[war crime]] as codified in the ''[[Rome Statute]]'', which was adopted in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(ICC), art.8(20)(f) July 17, 1998, 2187 U.N.T.S. 3; {{bluebook journal |last=Schmitt |first=Michael |title=Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/cjtl47&amp;start_page=292&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=298 |year=2009 |volume=47 |journal=Colum. J. Transnat'l L. |page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the ''Rome Statute'' prohibits "utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas, or military forces immune from military operations."&lt;ref&gt;International Criminal Court, Elements of Crimes, art.8(2)(b)(xxiii), U.N. Doc. PCINICC/2000/1/Add.2 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the law of armed conflict only applied to sovereign states. Non-international conflicts were governed by the domestic law of the State concerned. Under the current terms of the ''Rome Statute'' the use of human shields is defined as a war crime only in the context of an international armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;International Criminal Court, Elements of Crimes, art.8(2)(b)(xxiii), U.N. Doc. PCINICC/2000/1/Add.2 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of World War II, non-international armed conflicts have become more commonplace. The ''Customary International Humanitarian Law'' guide suggests that rules prohibiting use of civilians as human shields are "arguably" customary in non-international armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website |last=Henckaerts |first=Jean-Marie | last2=Doswald-Beck | first2=Louise |title=Customary International Humanitarian Law |publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/customary-international-humanitarian-law-i-icrc-eng.pdf |date=2005}};[hereinafter CIHL]&lt;/ref&gt;  The development and application of humanitarian law to modern asymmetric warfare is currently being debated by legal scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website| last=Marauhn |first=Thilo |title=Armed Conflict, Non-International |publisher=MPEPIL |url=http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e243?result=1&amp;rskey=gZ7eSJ&amp;prd=OPIL |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|Human shield}}
The laws of war first began to develop the [[Distinction (law)|distinction]] between military and civilian targets at The Second Hague Peace Conference of 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Reynolds |first=Jefferson D. |title=Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/airfor56&amp;start_page=1&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=5 |year=2005 |volume=56 |journal=A.F. L. Rev.| page=1}}, at 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War I, the concept of total war permitted most actions that supported the war effort. In "total war" targeting civilians was allowed, if it would support a military objective to demoralize the enemy. Indiscriminate bombing was considered an acceptable method to achieve the military advantage of defeating enemy morale and eroding popular support for the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.,''{{bluebook journal |last=Artz |first=Margaret |title=Chink in the Armor: How a Uniform Approach to Proportionality Analysis Can End the Use of Human Shields |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/vantl45&amp;start_page=1447&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=1469 |year=2012 |volume=45 |journal=Vand.

L. Rev.|page=56}}, at 10;&lt;/ref&gt; Early attempts to protect civilians as a class were largely unsuccessful. World War II was also fought within the framework of the total war concept.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,''{{Smallcaps|Horst Boog, Et al.,7 Germany and the Second World War 10 (2006).}}(quoting the Casablanca Directive, which described Allied strategy as "the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial, and economic system, and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened")&lt;/ref&gt;

The Geneva Conventions of 1949 were the first significant protections for civilians in war. These protections were expanded by the Additional Protocols in 1977. Protocol I requires that attacks be limited to military objectives, which are defined as targets that make an "effective contribution to military action" where the destruction of the target provides a "definite military advantage" to the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Protocol I, art. 52(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal doctrine ==
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=Attacks shall be strictly limited to military objectives.

Military necessity can justify the use of force in certain circumstances, where there is a military advantage to be gained by an attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Reynolds |first=Jefferson D. |title=Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/airfor56&amp;start_page=1&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=5 |year=2005 |volume=56 |journal=A.F. L. Rev.| page=1}}, at 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the use of force is excessive relative to its anticipated military advantage it is said to be disproportionate. Disproportionate force is prohibited under international law.

Risk to civilians does not bar military action, but the principle of proportionality requires that precautions be taken to minimize the harm to these protected persons. This analysis includes considerations like whether circumstances permit the attacker to time a military action to minimize the presence of civilians at the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Bartels |first=Rogier |title=Dealing with the Principle of Proportionality in Armed Conflict in Retrospect: The Application of the Principle in International Criminal Trials |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/israel46&amp;start_page=271&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=275 |year= |volume=46 |journal=Israel Law Review |page=271}}, at 303&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Rome Statute using protected persons as shields in an international armed conflict is a war crime.&lt;ref&gt;International Criminal Court, Elements of Crimes, art.8(2)(b)(xxiii), U.N. Doc. PCINICC/2000/1/Add.2 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently debate amongst legal scholars about whether traditional proportionality analysis should be modified to take into account the culpability of actors who use human shields to gain a strategic advantage. In modern asymmetric warfare it has become difficult to distinguish between military targets and civilians, but State actors still rely on traditional principles that present challenges when applied to asymmetric conflicts. Non-state forces, like guerillas and terrorists, conceal themselves among civilian populations and may take advantage of this position to launch attacks. When military action targeting these unconventional combatants results in civilian deaths, State actors may blame the deaths on enemy forces who use human shields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website |last=Cassese |first=Antonio |title=Current Challenges to International Humanitarian Law |publisher=Oxford  |url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/law/9780199559695.001.0001/law-9780199559695-e-1 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proportionate proportionality analysis ===
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=Military necessity permits a belligerent, subject to the laws of war, to apply any amount and kind of force to compel the complete submission of the enemy with the least possible expenditure of time, life, and money . . . it permits the destruction of life, of armed enemies and other persons whose destruction is incidentally unavoidable . . . but does not permit the killing of innocent inhabitants for purposes of revenge or the satisfaction of a lust to kill. |source=—''United States v.

Some scholars, including Ammon Rubinstein and Yaniv Roznai, argue that the use of human shields should be a factor in determining whether the use of force was justifiable under the guiding principles of [[Distinction (law)|distinction]] and [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]]. In their view, the use of human shields undermines an attackers right to self defense because the military necessity of self-defense must be a consideration in the excessive force analysis. Rubinstein and Roznai have described this analysis as a "proportionate proportionality."&lt;ref&gt;''See''{{bluebook journal |last1=Rubinstein |first=Ammon |last=Roznai |first2=Yaniv |title=Human Shields in Modern Armed Conflicts: The Need for a Proportionate Proportionality |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/stanlp22&amp;start_page=93&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=95 |year=2011|volume=22 |journal=Stan.

Rubinstein and Roznai argue that an attack that would be disproportionate ought to be considered proportionate, if the presence of civilians is due to the wrongful actions of the enemy.  They use the term "impeded party" to describe the burden placed on the attacking party under International Humanitarian Law norms. They point out that "attacking party" has traditionally been synonymous with the aggressor, but that it is often the attacker who is "defending democracy" and acting in self-defense when they use force in response to a prior attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last1=Rubinstein |first=Ammon |last=Roznai |first2=Yaniv |title=Human Shields in Modern Armed Conflicts: The Need for a Proportionate Proportionality |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/stanlp22&amp;start_page=93&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=95 |year=2011|volume=22 |journal=Stan.

Douglas Fischer believes that the increase of civilian casualties that began with the Vietnam War is partially due to an increased use of "illegal and perfidious" tactics in modern warfare, including the use of civilians as human shields.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Fischer |first=Douglas H. |title=Human Shields,a Homicides, and House Fires: How a Domestic Law Analogy Can Guide International Law Regarding Human Shield Tactics in Armed Conflict |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/aulr57&amp;start_page=479&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=492 |year=2007 |volume=57 |journal=Am.

U. L. Rev. |page=479}}, at 488-89 (arguing that attackers can not meet Article 57 obligations to take "precationary measures" unless defenders separate civilian and military targets.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voluntary and involuntary ===
Combatants in an armed conflict are prohibited from using protected civilians as involuntary human shields to support an unjust war effort. Civilians who are used as involuntary human shields by unlawful combatants do not lose their basic rights.&lt;ref name=OHEW&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Haque |first=Adil Ahmed |editor-last=Lazar |editor-first=Seth  |encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Ethics and War |title=Human Shields |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-994341-8|}}; {{bluebook journal |last=Schmitt |first=Michael |title=Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/cjtl47&amp;start_page=292&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=298 |year=2009 |volume=47 |journal=Colum. J. Transnat'l L. |page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of involuntary human shields does not release the other party from legal obligations to not target civilians or inflict excessive collateral damage.

Voluntary human shields may be considered "direct participants in hostilities," if they shield targeted personnel or properties. This could also be considered treason. However, if they are shielding protected personnel or properties, they may still retain their protected status. This debated area of customary international law has not yet been codified.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=al-Duaij |first=Nada |title=The Volunteer Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/porril12&amp;start_page=117&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=121 |year=2010 |volume=12 |journal=Or. Rev. Int'l L. |page=117}}, at 117-122&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and the European Union are considered the main sources for voluntary human shields. In 2003, human rights activists travelled to Baghdad to serve as human shields and protest the unpopular U.S. invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=al-Duaij |first=Nada |title=The Volunteer Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/porril12&amp;start_page=117&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=121 |year=2010 |volume=12 |journal=Or. Rev. Int'l L. |page=117}}, at 117-120&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in 2003, American peace activist [[Rachel Corrie]] was killed after she was crushed to death by an Israeli army bulldozer in [[Rafah]] while volunteering with the [[International Solidarity Movement]] as a human shield to prevent the demolition of homes in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Maalouf |first=Kristina |title=The Political Question Doctrine in the Ninth Circuit and Why it Should not have Barred the Adjudication of ''Corrie v.

Rev |page=35}}, at 36&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current limitations of IHL ===
While IHL does prohibit attacks on civilians, the precautions a power must take before an attack remain ill-defined. Proportionality remains a nebulous standard that does not set a predictable standard of when a military action would be considered lawful. There is a lack of enforcement, and the increasing role of private actors and contractors on the battlefield presents new challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website |last=Cassese |first=Antonio |title=Current Challenges to International Humanitarian Law |publisher=Oxford  |url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/law/9780199559695.001.0001/law-9780199559695-e-1 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. law ===
During the Civil War, the United States adopted the [[Lieber Code]], recognized by many scholars as the first detailed code governing conduct in war. Dr. [[Francis Lieber]] articulated an early version of the principle of proportionality: that civilians were not to be targeted, but were also not immune in all circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Artz |first=Margaret |title=Chink in the Armor: How a Uniform Approach to Proportionality Analysis Can End the Use of Human Shields |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/vantl45&amp;start_page=1447&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=1469 |year=2012 |volume=45 |journal=Vand. J. Transnat'l L. |page=1447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of human shields is prohibited and defined as a war crime by several U.S. military manuals. It is also defined as a crime triable by military commission under the US Military Commissions Act (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website |title=Customary IHL – Practice Relating to Rule 97.

== Modern warfare tactic ==
If the belligerent attacks in areas where human shields are used, this can weaken international and domestic support by exploiting harmed civilians. For nations that are particularly sensitive to collateral damage, an enemy's use of shields may effectively deter or delay military actions.

There have been numerous documented incidents where this tactic has not been successful in deterring attacks, including the [[Amiriyah shelter bombing]] during the [[Persian Gulf War|First Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=al-Duaij |first=Nada |title=The Volunteer Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/porril12&amp;start_page=117&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=121 |year=2010 |volume=12 |journal=Or.

In philosophy and theology, '''infinity''' is explored in articles under headings such as [[the Ultimate (philosophy)|the Ultimate]], the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]], [[God]], and [[Zeno's paradoxes]]. In [[Greek philosophy]], for example in [[Anaximander]], 'the Boundless' is the origin of all that is. He took the beginning or first principle to be an endless, unlimited primordial mass (ἄπειρον, ''apeiron''). The [[Jainism|Jain]] metaphysics and mathematics was the first to define and delineate different "types" of infinities. The work of the mathematician [[Georg Cantor]] first placed infinity into a coherent mathematical framework. Keenly aware of his departure from traditional wisdom, Cantor also presented a comprehensive historical and philosophical discussion of infinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newstead|first=A.|title=Cantor on Infinity in Nature, Number, and the Divine Mind|journal=American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly|publication-date=2009|volume=83|issue=4|page=|pages=533–553.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Judeo-Christian]] theology, for example in the work of [[Duns Scotus]], the infinite nature of God invokes a sense of being without constraint, rather than a sense of being unlimited in quantity. In [[ethics]] infinity plays an important role designating that which cannot be defined or reduced to knowledge or power.

====Aristotle and after====

Aristotle, alive for the period 384–322 BCE, is credited with being the root of a field of thought, in his influence of succeeding thinking for a period spanning more than one subsequent millennium, by his rejection of the idea of [[actual infinity]].&lt;ref name=" Rudy Rucker "&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/infinity-mathematics |author=Rudy Rucker |title=Infinity: Mathematics |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date= |isbn= |page=|accessdate=2016-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Book 3 of the work entitled [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]], written by [[Aristotle]], Aristotle deals with the [[concept]] of infinity in terms of his notion of [[actuality]] and of [[potentiality]].&lt;ref name="[[Wolfgang Achtner]]"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVNbIGS37wMC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Aristotle+Infinity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gT2HVdSWNoPTU_LhgIAF&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Aristotle%20Infinity&amp;f=false|author=[[Wolfgang Achtner]]|title=Infinity: New Research Frontiers - Chapter 1 : Infinity as a Transformative concept in Science and Theology (p.22) |publisher=Cambridge University Press, 7 Feb 2011 {{ISBN|1139495569}},  edited by [[Michał Heller|Revd Dr Michael Heller]], [[W.

{{quotation|... It is always possible to think of a larger number: for the number of times a magnitude can be bisected is infinite.  Hence the infinite is potential, never actual; the number of parts that can be taken always surpasses any assigned number.|''Physics'' 207b8}}

This is often called potential infinity; however, there are two ideas mixed up with this. One is that it is always possible to find a number of things that surpasses any given number, even if there are not actually such things. The other is that we may quantify over infinite sets without restriction. For example, &lt;math&gt;\forall n \in \mathbb{Z} (\exists m \in \mathbb{Z} [m &gt; n \wedge P(m)] )&lt;/math&gt;, which reads, "for any [[integer]] n, there exists an integer m &gt; n such that P(m)". The second view is found in a clearer form by medieval writers such as [[William of Ockham]]:

{{quotation|''Sed omne continuum est actualiter existens. Igitur quaelibet pars sua est vere existens in rerum natura. Sed partes continui sunt infinitae quia non tot quin plures, igitur partes infinitae sunt actualiter existentes.''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But every continuum is actually existent. Therefore any of its parts is really existent in nature. But the parts of the continuum are infinite because there are not so many that there are not more, and therefore the infinite parts are actually existent.}}

The parts are actually there, in some sense. However, on this view, no infinite magnitude can have a number, for whatever number we can imagine, there is always a larger one: "There are not so many (in number) that there are no more."

Aristotle's views on the continuum foreshadow some topological aspects of modern mathematical theories of the continuum. Aristotle's emphasis on the connectedness of the continuum may have inspired—in different ways—modern philosophers and mathematicians such as Charles Sanders Peirce, Cantor, and LEJ Brouwer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aristotle and modern mathematical theories of the continuum, in Aristotle and Contemporary Science II|last=Newstead|first=A.G.J.|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2001|isbn=|location=Frankfurt|pages=113–129.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Continuous and the Discrete|last=White|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the scholastics, [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] also argued against the idea that infinity could be in any sense complete or a totality.

Aristotle deals with infinity in the context of the [[prime mover theory|prime mover]], in Book 7 of the same work, the reasoning of which was later studied and commented on by [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]].&lt;ref name="R. Sorabji (C. Hagen)"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3JcjAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=R. Sorabji (C.

====Augustine====

[[Augustine]] thought infinity to be "incomprehensible for the human mind".&lt;ref name=" Dr Adam Drozdek "/&gt;

===Early Indian thinking===

The [[Jainism|Jain]] upanga [[Jain Agamas|āgama]] [[Sūryaprajñapti|Surya Prajnapti]] (c. 400 BC) classifies all numbers into three sets: enumerable, innumerable, and infinite. Each of these was further subdivided into three orders:

* Enumerable: lowest, intermediate and highest
* Innumerable: nearly innumerable, truly innumerable and innumerably innumerable
* Infinite: nearly infinite, truly infinite, infinitely infinite

[[File:Number theory 1.jpg|thumb|Jain theory of numbers (See IIIrd section for various infinities)]]
The Jains were the first to discard the idea that all infinities were the same or equal. They recognized different types of infinities: infinite in length (one [[dimension]]), infinite in area (two dimensions), infinite in volume (three dimensions), and infinite perpetually (infinite number of dimensions).

According to Singh (1987), Joseph (2000) and Agrawal (2000), the highest enumerable number ''N'' of the Jains corresponds to the modern concept of [[Aleph number|aleph-null]] &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; (the [[cardinal number]] of the infinite set of integers 1, 2, ...), the smallest cardinal [[transfinite number]]. The Jains also defined a whole system of infinite cardinal numbers, of which the highest enumerable number ''N'' is the smallest.

In the Jaina work on the [[Set theory|theory of sets]], two basic types of infinite numbers are distinguished. On both physical and [[Ontology|ontological]] grounds, a distinction was made between {{IAST|''asaṃkhyāta''}} ("countless, innumerable") and ''ananta'' ("endless, unlimited"), between rigidly bounded and loosely bounded infinities.

==Views from the Renaissance to modern times==

===Galileo===
{{main article|Galileo's paradox}}

[[Galileo Galilei]] (February 1564 - January 1642 &lt;ref name=" O'Connor, Robertson "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Galileo.html |author=J.J.  O'Connor, E.F. Robertson|title=Galileo Galilei|publisher=St Andrews University|date=2002|accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;)   discussed the example of comparing the [[square number]]s {1, 4, 9, 16, ...} with the [[natural number]]s {1, 2, 3, 4, ...} as follows:
: 1 → 1&lt;br&gt; 2 → 4&lt;br&gt; 3 → 9&lt;br&gt; 4 → 16&lt;br&gt; …

It appeared by this reasoning as though a "set" (Galileo did not use the terminology) which is naturally smaller than the "set" of which it is a part (since it does not contain all the members) is in some sense the same "size". Galileo found no way around this problem:

{{quotation|So far as I see we can only infer that the totality of all numbers is infinite, that the number of squares is infinite, and that the number of their roots is infinite; neither is the number of squares less than the totality of all numbers, nor the latter greater than the former; and finally the attributes "equal," "greater," and "less," are not applicable to infinite, but only to finite, quantities.|''On two New Sciences'', 1638}}

The idea that size can be measured by one-to-one correspondence is today known as [[Hume's principle]], although Hume, like Galileo, believed the principle could not be applied to the infinite. The same concept, applied by [[Georg Cantor]], is used in relation to infinite sets.

Famously, the ultra-empiricist [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] ( April 1588 -  December 1679 &lt;ref name="  Sorell"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Hobbes|author=T. Sorell |title=Thomas Hobbes (English philosopher)|publisher=Britannica |date=30 October 2014 |accessdate=2016-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)  tried to defend the idea of a potential infinity in light of the discovery, by [[Evangelista Torricelli]], of a figure ([[Gabriel's Horn]]) whose [[surface area]] is infinite, but whose [[volume]] is finite.  Not reported, this motivation of Hobbes came too late as [[curve]]s having infinite length yet bounding finite areas were known much before.

===John Locke===
[[John Locke|Locke]] ( August 1632 - October 1704  &lt;ref name=" Rogers214 "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Locke |author=G.A.J. Rogers |title=John Locke, English philosopher |publisher=Brittanica |date=2015-12-14 |accessdate=2016-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) in common with most of the [[empiricist]] philosophers, also believed that we can have no proper idea of the infinite.  They believed all our ideas were derived from [[sense data]] or "impressions," and since all sensory impressions are inherently finite, so too are our thoughts and ideas.  Our idea of infinity is merely negative or privative.

{{quotation|Whatever ''positive'' ideas we have in our minds of any space, duration, or number, let them be never so great, they are still finite; but when we suppose an inexhaustible remainder, from which we remove all bounds, and wherein we allow the mind an endless progression of thought, without ever completing the idea, there we have our idea of infinity... yet when we would frame in our minds the idea of an infinite space or duration, that idea is very obscure and confused, because it is made up of two parts very different, if not inconsistent.  For let a man frame in his mind an idea of any space or number, as great as he will, it is plain the mind rests and terminates in that idea; which is contrary to the idea of infinity, which consists in a supposed endless progression.|Essay,  II. xvii. 7., author's emphasis}}

He considered that in considerations on the subject of eternity, which he classified as an infinity, humans are likely to make mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GZkDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=Locke&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5DIXVZa1LtT3ar-qgOgP&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Locke&amp;f=false Philosophical beauties selected from the works of John Locke - p.237] T.Hurst 1802 [Retrieved 2015-3-28](ed. Locke writes: And hence it is, that in disputes and reasonings concerning eternity, or any other infinite, we are apt to blunder, and involve ourselves in manifest absurdities...)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern philosophical views==
Modern discussion of the infinite is now regarded as part of set theory and mathematics. Contemporary philosophers of mathematics engage with the topic of infinity and generally acknowledge its role in mathematical practice. But, although set theory is now widely accepted, this was not always so.  Influenced by L.E.J Brouwer and verificationism in part, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] (April 1889  Vienna - April  1951 Cambridge, England &lt;ref name="  Monk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Ludwig-Wittgenstein|author=R. Monk|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein, British philosopher|publisher=Britannica |date=8 April 2016 |accessdate=2016-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), made an impassioned attack upon [[axiomatic set theory]], and upon the idea of the actual infinite, during his "middle period".&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite web | title=  Logic of antinomies | url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ndjfl/1093891610 | accessdate=July 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Does the relation &lt;math&gt;m = 2n&lt;/math&gt; correlate the class of all numbers with one of its subclasses? No. It correlates any arbitrary number with another, and in that way we arrive at infinitely many pairs of classes, of which one is correlated with the other, but which are never related as class and subclass.  Neither is this infinite process itself in some sense or other such a pair of classes... In the superstition that &lt;math&gt;m = 2n&lt;/math&gt; correlates a class with its subclass, we merely have yet another case of ambiguous grammar.|''Philosophical Remarks'' § 141, cf ''Philosophical Grammar'' p. 465}}

Unlike the traditional empiricists, he thought that the infinite was in some way given to [[empirical evidence|sense experience]].

{{quotation|... I can see in space the possibility of any finite experience... we recognize [the] essential infinity of space in its smallest part."  "[Time] is infinite in the same sense as the three-dimensional space of sight and movement is infinite, even if in fact I can only see as far as the walls of my room.}}

{{quotation|... what is infinite about endlessness is only the endlessness itself.}}

===Emmanuel Levinas===
The philosopher [[Emmanuel Levinas]] ( January 1906, Lithuania -   December 25 1995, Paris    &lt;ref name="  Bergo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/levinas/#LifCar |author=Bergo, Bettina|title=Emmanual Levinas |publisher=Stanford University |date=23 July 2006 |accessdate=2016-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; )  uses infinity to designate that which cannot be defined or reduced to knowledge or power.  In Levinas' magnum opus [[Totality and Infinity]] he says :

{{quotation|
...infinity is produced in the relationship of the same with the other, and how the particular and the personal, which are unsurpassable, as it were magnetize the very field in which the production of infinity is enacted...

The idea of infinity is not an incidental notion forged by a subjectivity to reflect the case of an entity encountering on the outside nothing that limits it, overflowing every limit, and thereby infinite.  The production of the infinite entity is inseparable from the idea of infinity, for it is precisely in the disproportion between the idea of infinity and the infinity of which it is the idea that this exceeding of limits is produced.  The idea of infinity is the mode of being, the infinition, of infinity... All knowing qua intentionality already presupposes the idea of infinity, which is preeminently non-adequation.|p. 26-27}}

Levinas also wrote a work entitled ''Philosophy and the Idea of Infinity'', which was published during 1957.&lt;ref&gt;E. Levinas - [https://books.google.com/books?id=kH9vvm-AHfUC&amp;pg=PA47 Collected Philosophical Papers (p.47)] (Translated by A. Lingis) Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 31 March 1987 {{ISBN|9024733952}} [Retrieved 2015-05-01]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Movement Writing Alphabet''' (IMWA) is a set of symbols that can be used to describe and record movement. Its creator, Valerie Sutton, also invented ''MovementWriting'', which employs IMWA in four general application areas: [[SignWriting]] for [[sign language]], [[DanceWriting]] as a form of [[dance notation]], MimeWriting for classic [[mime]], and SportsWriting for [[ice skating]] and [[gymnastics]].

==Identification numbers==
The IMWA has more than 27,000 elements that are represented by unique identification numbers. Each identification number specifies six attributes—{{clarify span|category, group, symbol, variation, fill, and rotation|date=April 2014}}—as dash-separated values. The symbol is specified with a three-digit value whereas all other attributes use a two-digit value (e.g., 01-01-001-01-01-01).

There are eight categories: hand, movement, face, head, upper body, full body, space, and punctuation.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}

There are 40 groups{{clarify|date=April 2014}}. The {{clarify span|keyboard design and symbol palette|date=April 2014}} are based on the 40 groups.

==History==
[[File:Explaining ase Wikipedia at SDPL jeh.jpg|thumb|Valerie Sutton]]
The IMWA was originally designed for describing sign language and consequently was named ''Sutton's Sign Symbol Sequence'' (SSS) by its inventor, Valerie Sutton. The original symbol set, SSS-95, was limited in size due to memory constraints in personal computers at the time. The SSS-99 symbol set expanded the number of symbols, and the SSS-2002 set was the first to use the current identification numbering system. The final version, SSS-2004, was renamed ''International Movement Writing Alphabet'' (SSS-IMWA) to reflect its usefulness in applications beyond sign language.

== Early life ==
Dalanon was born on 1981 in [[Cebu City]] to Capt. Benjamin Dalanon Jr., a retired master mariner, and Mrs. Angelina Dalanon, a retired teacher. He is the eldest among four siblings. He spent his preschool days at the Sacred Heart School for Boys, elementary at the [[University of San Carlos]] Boys School, and was a scholar at the [[Cebu City National Science High School]].

He finished his dental degree in 2005 at the Southwestern University PHINMA. After passing the Professional Regulation Commission's licensure examination for dentists, he studied Nursing for Health Allied Professions for a year at the [[Cebu Normal University]] while undergoing a postgraduate training in orthodontics and temporomandibular joint dysfunction management at the Center for Advance Dental Studies in [[Quezon City|Quezon City, Philippines]]. He then took up and finished a certificate course in [[Professional education|Professional Education]] in 2008, Diploma in  [[Special education|Special Education]] in 2009, [[Master of Arts in Teaching]] Special Education in 2010, and [[Doctor of Education]] in [[Educational Management Administration &amp; Leadership|Educational Management]] in 2014.

== Academic and professional career ==
In 2014 he was invited by the dean of the school of dentistry and the chief of clinics of Southwestern University PHINMA to join the faculty. As a specialist in special needs dentistry, he frequently lectures for the Philippine Dental Association Cebu Chapter and the [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Department of Health]] Regional Office VII (DOH RO VII) for the Public Health Dentists of Bohol, Cebu, Negros Oriental and Siquijor.  One of these lectures was during the 1st Public Health Dental Congress in Central Visayas on June 14 and 15, 2016 at Sarrosa International Hotel and Residential Suites, Kasambagan, Cebu City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ro7.doh.gov.ph/links-2/22-press-release/274-1st-public-health-dental-congress-in-central-visayas|title=1st Public Health Dental Congress in Central Visayas|last=Villas|first=Edsel Roseus|date=July 18, 2016|website=Republic of the Philippines Department of Health - Regional Office VII|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 he became the youngest president of the Philippine Dental Association Cebu Chapter and subsequently the youngest to receive a national award as one of only 10, Philippine Dental Association's most outstanding chapter presidents. Together with then president of the National Association of Dental Traders, Inc., Mrs. Lourdes Villaroman, they organized the 1st Philipine Dental Exposition on July 28-29, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dentisty.org/the-1st-philippine-dental-exposition--nadti.html|title=The 1st philippine dental exposition – nadti|website=dentisty.org|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his term of office, he has been a frequent source of information regarding dental health in various radio and television programs like [[ABS-CBN (TV network)|ABS-CBN]]'s [[TV Patrol Central Visayas|TV Patrol]] and DYAB Cebu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=DYAB Cebu|title=DYAB Cebu Live Streaming (Saturday, February 27, 2016)|date=2016-02-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN2CQz6khHk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=898|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Katrin Hattenhauer''' (born  10 November 1968 in [[Nordhausen]], [[Thueringen]]) is a German [[painter]] and [[civil rights activist]]. In the late 1980s she was a member of the [[GDR-opposition movement]]. On 4 September 1989 she demonstrated "For an Open Country with Free People", marking the beginning of the [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstrations]] in [[Leipzig]]. Her paintings and social sculptures have been exhibited in Europe.

== Life and work ==

Katrin Hattenhauer was not allowed to sit the Abitur, Germany's secondary-school examinations. Upon completing her school education she worked as a puppeteer at the local theatre in her home town [Nordhausen]. She moved on to working for the [[Wittenberg]] research centre of the East-German churches and completed an internship at the [[Zionsparish]] in Dresden. In 1988 she took up her studies at the church run theological university in [[Leipzig]]. However, due to her increased political activity – among other things she had distributed pamphlets for a demonstration in January 1989 - the GDR government pressured the church to force her to leave the university, which she ultimately did.  Katrin Hattenhauer was an active member of the [[‘Arbeitskreis Gerechtigkeit’]] (Working Committee Justice), an independent Leipzig-based opposition group that was part of the network [[‘Initiative Frieden und Menschenrechte’]] (Initiative Peace and Human Rights). Moreover, she was active in the [[Monday Peaceprayers]] at the [[Nikolaichurch]], which were coordinated by pastor [[Christoph Wonneberger]].

Together with the former songwriter Jochen Läßig, who had been ex-matriculated from the theological university Leipzig due to his political activity, she organised the first street music festival in the city centre of Leipzig. The festival took place on 10 June 1989. However, the festival had been illegal and numerous contributors, visitors, and pedestrians were arrested. Importantly, the street festival was the first occasion in the GDR on which passers-by solidarised themselves with political dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lieberwirth|first1=Steffen|title=wer eynen spielmann zy Tode schlaegt ... Ein mittelalterliches Zeitdokument anno 1989|date=1990|location=Leipzig|isbn=978-3-369-00272-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stasi]] (Staatsicherheitsdienst, state security service) maintained the operational identity check ([[Operative Personenkontrolle]]) 'Meise' (Tit) for the surveillance of Katrin Hattenhauer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sturm|first1=Daniel|title=Ich will Täterin bleiben|date=November 1999|publisher=Kreuzer|location=Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, despite the regular Stasi-interrogations and an order that prevented her from earning a living almost entirely, she continued to commit herself to political change in the GDR. She went on hunger strike at the Thomas-church Leipzig and criticised the constitutional capacity of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] directly and openly. Referring to [[Vaclav Havel]] she called for the 'bond-slaves' in a system of paternalism' to 'renounce resignation in the society': 'We pray for wisdom and courage, so that what is limited to narrowness and prison for so many may become our home country again'.

On 4 September 1989 she initiated, together with Gesine Oltmanns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Bärbel Bohley, Gerald Praschl, Rüdiger|title=Mut : Frauen in der DDR : mit Fotos und Dokumenten|date=2005|publisher=Herbig|location=München|isbn=978-3-7766-2434-2|pages=194–220, esp. 216–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; a demonstration in front of the Nikolaichurch, after the Monday Peace Prayer held there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beckenbach|first1=Niels|editor1-last=Beckenbach|editor1-first=Niels|title=Fremde Brüder : der schwierige Weg zur deutschen Einheit|date=2008|publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-428-12727-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both women had prepared four banners, had smuggled them into the church circumventing their surveillants from the Stasi. Coming out into the public square the two women then unfolded their banner that called for 'Für ein offenes Land mit freien Menschen' (For an Open Country with Free People),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindner (Hrsg.)|first1=Bernd|title=Zum Herbst 89 : demokratische Bewegung in der DDR|date=1994|publisher=Forum Verlag|location=Leipzig|isbn=978-3-86151-062-8|pages=9–10|edition=1. Aufl.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Speech of the German president Joachim Gauk on the German unity day, Gewandhaus Leipzig 2015&lt;/ref&gt; while more activists followed them with the other banners.

About 50 activists and 250 people who wanted to emigrate from the GDR joined behind them in a first attempt to move on demonstrating, some shouting 'we want to get out', others 'we stay'. Western TV teams, which had been allowed into Leipzig to cover the fair, had secretly been informed that something would be happening in front of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jankowski|first1=Martin|title=Der Tag, der Deutschland veränderte : 9.

Aufl.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the following Monday, 11 September, Katrin Hattenhauer was targeted demonstrating on [[Nikolaisquare]] and arrested together with other protesters and put in the [[Stasi-prison at Leipzig Beethoven Strasse]], where she was imprisoned until 13.10.1089. In prison she was kept in solitary confinement for most of the time and interrogated brutally. Yet, on each following Monday more and more people joined the Mondaydemonstrations in [[Leipzig]], contributing decisively to the eventual downfall of the GDR regime. Regular services and public vigils in different cities of the GDR called for the release of the unjustly imprisoned. Thus, focal points of protest developed, accelerating the democratic revolution.
Katrin Hattenhauer was well known in opposition-circles and church-groups in the GDR, she had participated in the [[Oecomenical Convention]] and taken part in trans-regional ecological seminars. She was the Leipzig contact person to the [[ecological library]] (Umweltbibliothek) a meeting point of the opposition groups in East-Berlin.

In 1991 she helped to establish the Archiv [[Bürgerbewegung Leipzig]] (The Archiv Bürgerbewegung received the German National Award in 2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archiv Bürgerbewegung, Deutscher Nationalpreis, 2014|url=http://www.nationalstiftung.de/nationalpreis2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; working on the board. On 8 October 2000 she and Jochen Läßig, another dissident, opened the "Lichtfest" (Festival of Light) in Leipzig, speaking in front of 200.000 people to remember the crucial turning point in 1989.  On 7 November 2014 Katrin Hattenhauer spoke at Germany's ceremonial act, celebrating the 25 year anniversary of the fall of the wall and German reunification at the [[Brandenburg Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Welt&amp;nbsp;Online, November 9th 2009|url=https://beta.welt.de/regionales/berlin/article5138142/20-Jahre-Mauerfall-so-feierte-Berlin.html?wtrid=crossdevice.welt.desktop.vwo.article-spliturl&amp;betaredirect=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, she addressed the younger generation, urging them to 'take their freedom and live their dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Höher|first1=Sabine|title=Die Welt, November 11th 2009|url=https://beta.welt.de/welt_print/debatte/article5166203/Wenn-sich-einer-die-Freiheit-nimmt-Katrin-Hattenhauer.html?wtrid=crossdevice.welt.desktop.vwo.article-spliturl&amp;betaredirect=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; The touring exhibition 'Revolution is female'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Archiv Bürgerbewegung|url=http://www.archiv-buergerbewegung.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=98:revolution-ist-weiblich&amp;catid=36:ausstellungen&amp;Itemid=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes her and other women's contributions to the Peaceful Revolution 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Annika|title=Heldinnen der friedlichen Revolution|journal=[[EMMA (magazine)|EMMA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katrin Hattenhauer often comments on the Peaceful Revolution 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wir mussten uns dieses Land zurückerobern|url=http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/montagsdemo-ddr-am-4-september-1989-a-989176.html|website=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; and questions of German unity. Similarly, she speaks on radio, TV and frequently at schools, answering questions about civil courage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Katrin Hattenhauer interviewed by Christhardt Läpple: „Helden“, ZDF, aired 14.12.2013,|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvCQ_DAKrgo|website=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is serving on the board of the [[Kreisau-Initiative]] and on the historical commission of the [[Krzyzowa/Kreisau foundation]] in Poland. In October 2015 she initiated an open letter of former East-German dissidents to [[Angela Merkel]], supporting a policy of open borders for refugees who seek political asylum. The letter was published by the Deutsche Welle in English, French, Russian and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former GDR rights activists support Merkel's refugee policy|url=http://www.dw.com/en/former-gdr-rights-activists-support-merkels-refugee-policy/a-18802792|website=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Der offene Brief an Merkel im Wortlaut, the open letter to Merkel|url=http://www.dw.com/de/der-offene-brief-an-merkel-im-wortlaut/a-18801502|website=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has got one son and is living together with her husband in Berlin and Oxford.

==Work as an artist==

In the wake of the Peaceful Revolution Katrin Hattenhauer became an artist. Her first exhibition "Magical Theatre"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Freiheit wagen|journal=booklet of the 1999 exhibition at Nikolaichurch Leipzig}}&lt;/ref&gt; was opened in her flat in Leipzig on 9.December 1989. She has had exhibitions in numerous places in Europe and in the United States. The secretary-general of the biennial national Protestant gathering (Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag), [[Ellen Ueberschär]], described her art as follows: "Hattenhauer´s art is not GDR-art, not art of the GDR, it is an answer to the GDR, it is the 'even though' of an art that says 'Yes' to freedom against all odds.” Her figurative paintings focus on human emotion, freedom, and civil engagement. The late [[Freya von Moltke]] wrote about her: In the time before and around 1989, Katrin Hattenhauer has dared to demand freedom and has experienced what that can mean for the personal future. Stemming from this experience her paintings express great courage and joy in life." Katrin Hattenhauer, continually works with young people, using her art to approach questions of personal freedom and civil courage. In the last years Katrin Hattenhauer has turned towards and focused on installation art addressing various political and societal topics. "Lichtgestalten" about role models, Mannheim 2012,  "Müllwiese" (Rubbish Meadow) Hamburg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Translation of an article by E.Dunckel for Sueddeutsche Zeitung online|url=http://www.katrin-hattenhauer.de/rubbish_meadow_en.html|website=www.katrin-hattenhauer.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; shed and artistic light on the pollution of the oceans through plastic waste, while 'Über das Verschwinden (On Disappearing),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Disappearing - Art Project, Katrin Hattenhauer on Deutsche Welle|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT2AlzYWXMU|website=Youtube|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; London and Leipzig, raised awareness of the murder of political dissidents. At the moment she is linked with the Social Sculpture Unit, [[Brookes University]] Oxford.

Katrin Hattenhauer was awarded the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Officer´s Cross of the German Order of Merit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech of the German Federal President|url=http://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Berichte/DE/Joachim-Gauck/2015/10/151001-Verdienstorden-Tag-der-deutschen-Einheit.html?nn=1891680|website=www.bundespraesident.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], there are eight ''aśtopāyas'', or eight ways of attaining [[moksha]], and ''Mārdava'' is one of them, the other seven being – ''[[Yajna]]'' (यज्ञ) (sacrifices), ''[[Dāna]]'' (दान) (charity), ''Vedadhyayana'' (the study of the Vedas), ''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]]'' (तप) (penance, deep meditation), ''[[Uparati|Dama]]'' (दम)  (subduing the senses by restraining the sense-organs), ''[[Satya]]'' (सत्य) (truth in speech and act), and ''[[Tyāga]]'' (त्याग) (renunciation of desire).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World Vol.3|publisher=Concept Publishing|page=744|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=0U2QRpDv2KMC&amp;pg=PA744&amp;lpg=PA744&amp;dq=mardava++hinduism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k1KkDvZVz4&amp;sig=JrPZW-iyRWPazoaz1S0oL9iE_3E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VsECVdrPLc-VuASym4GQCA&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mardava%20%20hinduism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Jainism]], ''mārdava'' or compassion or supreme tenderness or humility, which is part of Right Belief, is a means to destroy vanity or egotism which gives rise to many evils which defile the virtues of our soul; it is held that humility is the foundation of compassion and the basis for salvation. With the eight kinds of pride totally avoided, knowledge brings humility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uttama Mardava Dharma|publisher=Jain Heritage Centres|url=http://www.jainheritagecentres.com/index.php/jainism/jain-festivals/dashalakshana-parva/1149-uttama-mardava-dharma-supreme-tenderness|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114511/http://www.jainheritagecentres.com/index.php/jainism/jain-festivals/dashalakshana-parva/1149-uttama-mardava-dharma-supreme-tenderness|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tattvārthasūtra]] (IX.6) lists ''mārdava'' (modesty) as one of the ten aspects of the highest '' [[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]] ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Philosophy from 350 to 600 A.D.|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=64|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5WHHJ6O7b-IC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=mardava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=coQBVdy-C4-0uATY9ICoAg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=mardava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Bhagavad Gita]] (XVI.1-3) also classifies ''mārdava'' as a divine quality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Astadala Yogamala Vol.1|author=B.K.S.Iyengar|publisher=Allied Publishers|page=124|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zp3n--MlL9wC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=mardava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CoUBVd-wHc3iuQSJp4GoAg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBTge#v=onepage&amp;q=mardava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Buddhist]]s consider ''mārdava'' as the realization of [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] (''dharma-pratipatti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism|author=Bibhuti Barua|publisher=Sarup &amp; sons|page=13|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=s1PZAMD13SMC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=mardava+++buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UoMCVYqnAczauQSZzoK4DA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=mardava%20%20%20buddhism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patanjali]] mentions ''mārdava'' as a low pitch along with ''anvavavasarga'' and ''udutā khasya''; he explains this word as ''svarasya mridutā'' or ''snigdhatā'' (smoothness of sound).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Astadhyayi of Panini|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=51|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EmW96v4gvycC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=mardava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j4MBVYDnM9C1uQSeyIGwAg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mardava&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10274">'''Modified Stave Notation (MSN)''' is an alternative way of notating music that was developed in the [[UK]] where it is widely used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnib.org.uk/livingwithsightloss/leisureculture/music/readingmusic/Pages/modstave.aspx Modified Stave Notation - RNIB]&lt;/ref&gt; MSN is intended to be used by people who cannot easily read ordinary musical [[Staff (music)|stave notation]] (or staff notation&lt;ref&gt;''Staff'' is more common in [[American English]], ''stave'' in [[British English]]. The plural is ''staves'' in either case; ''stave'' is, in fact, a [[back-formation]] from ''staves''. (Pam Peters, The Cambridge Guide to English Usage, p. 514.)&lt;/ref&gt;), even if it is enlarged, or for some people reduced in size. Such users include those with [[visual impairment]]s and those who are [[Dyslexia|dyslexic]].

== History of Modified Stave Notation ==

In the 1990s the then [[Royal National Institute of Blind People|Royal National Institute for the Blind]], negotiated with the [[Music Publishers Association (UK)|Music Publishers' Association]] an agreement to permit partially sighted people to enlarge music, providing only one copy was made and the enlarged music was not re-sold. For each item enlarged, permission was needed from the work's publisher who would then supply a yellow sticker with "MPA approved '''large print''' music copy RNIB" written over a five line stave. It was noted, however, at this time that enlargement produced new problems, notably with the extra space between symbols and the production of either unwieldy large and flimsy [[Sheet music|sheets]] or scores requiring more page turns and not necessarily in convenient places. So examples of music in which all signs equally enlarged but compacted horizontally were created.&lt;ref&gt;Ockelford, A. (1994) "Music in large print" Royal National Institute for the Blind and The Music Publishers' Association Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 1990s some music publishers started producing music in [[Large-print|large print]] fonts, taking layouts used widely for children's beginner tutor books and extending these to short [[Musical repertoire|repertoire pieces]], particularly for [[keyboard instrument]]s. The National Music and Disability Information Service&lt;ref&gt;National Music and Disability Information Service 1982 to 1998, based at Dartington Hall. This service was then taken under the umbrella of Soundsense, in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. [http://www.soundsense.org/ Sound sense]&lt;/ref&gt; kept a resource paper "RP14 Information on Music for People with Partial Sight" which listed some of these publishers.

With the advent of sophisticated [[Scorewriter|music notation software]], such as MuseScore,&lt;ref&gt;[https://musescore.org/en/tutorials/modified-stave-notation musescore.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the production of MSN became easier, with the ability to save preferred settings of each user. The Royal National Institute of Blind People is the largest formal producer of MSN in the world, with a production team based in [[Ivybridge]], [[Devon]]. MSN has become an accepted standard for public examinations in England and Wales, for [[GCSE]] and [[A level]] music and music technology papers, under general special arrangements authorised by the [[Joint Council for Qualifications]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcq.org.uk/ Joint Council for Qualifications]&lt;/ref&gt; and worldwide for sight reading tests for grade examination boards such as the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://gb.abrsm.org/en/exam-booking/special-needs/guidelines-for-candidates-with-dyslexia-dyspraxia-or-other-learning-difficulties/ Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Trinity College London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinitycollege.co.uk/site/?id=1315 Trinity College London]&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates requiring Modified Print copies of the [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]] may ask for MSN scores, sometimes in a standard format, sometimes tailor made to match a submitted example.

== Standards for Modified Stave Notation ==

Formalising standards for MSN in the UK involved:
* discussion amongst producers 
* experiments with users and
* examination with software producers of the variables within packages. 
The work was underpinned by links with [[RNIB| RNIB's]] general print guidelines for making information accessible for blind and partially sighted people, "See it Right".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnib.org.uk/professionals/accessibleinformation/pages/see_it_right.aspx See It Right - RNIB]&lt;/ref&gt; Reading music notation is more complex than reading prose involving complex [[Eye movement in music reading|eye movements]]. Not only are there many symbols of different shapes and sizes, but the signs are placed in [[vertical direction|vertical]] as well as [[horizontal plane|horizontal]] dimensions, some having effect for lines of music whilst others just apply to single features. Often the reader needs to read "in time" rather than at his or her own speed, alongside the execution of complex physical skills to render the symbols into sound via an [[musical instrument|instrument]]. Usually music is placed further away than ordinary print, allowing for an instrument to be placed between player and the printed music. There may also be the need to see a [[musical director]] in the middle distance. With [[E-book reader|eReading devices]] it is easy to obtain ordinary print consistently in one's preferred font size and type face. However, stave notation comes in all kinds of densities, type faces and relative symbols size. Modified Stave Notation can enable users to have consistent size and layout.

== Guidelines for Modified Stave Notation ==

Guidelines for the production of Modified Stave Notation are published by the UK Association for Accessible Formats (UKAAF)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukaaf.org UK Association for Accessible Formats (UKAAF)]&lt;/ref&gt;  in document "G009 UKAAF Modified Stave Notation meeting individual needs for large print music".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukaaf.org/members-area/guidance-documents/#G009 G009 UKAAF Modified Stave Notation meeting individual needs for large print music]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamentals of producing Modified Stave Notation are: 
* clear printing of symbols with no overlapping of different signs
* evening out the symbol size and density
* reducing redundant space
* placing symbols used around the stave at a consistent distance from the lines and the notes to which they refer (so once one is located, the reader can reasonably expect to find them in the same place later in the piece), and, 
* describe in words in a preface the location of sporadic or unusual symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, S-A. (2004) "Modified Stave Notation - An Approach to Making Stave Notation More Accessible to Users Who Are Partially Sighted" in K.Miesenberger et al. [Eds.] ICCHP 2004, LNCS 3118, pp. 236-239 Springer-Verlag: Berlin and Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other factors assisting accessibility ==

In addition to the alteration of stave notation layout in MSN, other factors affecting [[accessibility]] include binding, colour of background paper (as stave notation is conventionally in black ink) and lighting. The use of multimedia can also increase accessibility. For example, the music seen can also be heard electronically with a variety of levels of "interpretation" from just the pitch and note lengths, to full nuance and stylistic detail. Lastly, analysis and development of reading and memorisation techniques, pertinent to the user's requirements, may aid fluency.

== General principles of clear print used in Modified Stave Notation ==

Some principles from RNIB's guidelines 'See It Right' are transferred directly to stave notation in MSN. The staves and note stem thickness correspond to a thickness of letters in 16 [[Point (typography)|point]] typefaces. Spaces between systems&lt;ref&gt;The distance between the sets of music lines (2 for piano music, usually, or 3 for voice and piano, for example)&lt;/ref&gt; and between staves within a system are sufficiently large, although more use is made of left and right margins. Text is [[sans-serif|sans serif]],&lt;ref&gt;That is, without the "curly" edges to letters common in fonts such as Times New Roman&lt;/ref&gt; semi-bold or bold.

== Other modification in Modified Stave Notation ==

Numerals are used in music for all kinds of purposes: in MSN page numbers are distinguished from bar numbers, by being placed in circles, for example. In MSN the use of full size numerals for fingering rather than subscript size is a particular feature. Fingering numbers are also often place in a horizontal line rather than dipping up and down to follow the contour of the [[melody]], enabling a user to memorise the melody and then just follow the fingering numbers.

The need for text to follow easily from column to column, page to page, is especially important in MSN where page turns need to occur where possible at a place where there are bars or at least at suitable musical breaks. Many users of modified print materials read them with additional technological help, such as a closed circuit television screen: for this, the pages need to be able to lie flat. Much music is written in portrait format,&lt;ref&gt;Portrait format is that in which the longer sides of a sheet of paper is at the sides, whereas landscape format is where the longer sides of the paper are at the top and bottom&lt;/ref&gt; whereas landscape is preferred for MSN to reduce the number of times the reader has to track back to the beginning of a new system.

MSN using music notation software enables dyslexic and partially sighted people who struggle to use the huge variety of formats of stave notation to have their music produced in a consistent layout, according to certain conventions, allowing more fluent use.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, E.

He also served as the [[Organisation of African Unity]]'s Assistant Secretary General, the [[Arab League]]'s Assistant Secretary-general, the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]'s Special Representative for Somalia in 1992 and the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]'s Special Representative for the [[Great Lakes region of Africa]] in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unosom1backgr2.html|title=UNITED NATIONS OPERATION IN SOMALIA I (UNOSOM I) - Background (Full text)|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Press release of the United Nations on 27 January 1997: Mohamed Sahnoun of Algeria nominated UN/OAU special representative for great lakes region of Africa [https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1997/19970127.sga626.html]&lt;/ref&gt; before continuing to work for peace and reconciliation through various UN-related&lt;ref&gt;UPEACE – [[University for Peace]] [http://www.upeace.org/about/history.cfm]&lt;/ref&gt; or independent charities.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] {{cite web |url=http://www.iisd.org/about/staffbio.aspx?id=640 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231142216/http://www.iisd.org/about/staffbio.aspx?id=640 |archivedate=31 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = marshall&gt;[[Initiatives of Change]], interview with Katherine Marshall [http://www.iofc.org/mohamed-sahnoun-cfhs-interview-katherine-marshall]&lt;/ref&gt; He particularly focused on developing intercultural and inter-religious dialogues and on healing wounded memories from past conflicts.&lt;ref name = marshall/&gt;

==Early years and Algerian War==
Mohamed Sahnoun was born in 1931 in [[Chlef]] (known as [[Castellum Tingitanum]] during [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, [[Al Asnam]] during the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] period and from 1962 to 1980 as well as [[Orléansville]] during the French colonization), in [[Algeria]]. He first studied at the Lycée of Algiers and then went on at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris. He was there on the day of [[Algerian War#Beginning of hostilities|the first hostilities of the Algerian War]] (1 November 1954). As an activist of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]], he responded to the call to strike launched by the  '’Union générale des étudiants musulmans algériens (Ugema)'’ on 19 May 1956,&lt;ref&gt;Henry Clement-Moore, L'Ugema (1955–1962) : témoignages, Casbah Éditions, Alger, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; stopped studying in Paris and came back home in Algeria.

There, he started to work in the 'Social Centers' created by former French Resistance fighter [[Germaine Tillon]] with the agreement of [[Jacques Soustelle]] (then Governor General of Algeria) in order to alleviate misery, squalor and illiteracy in Algerian populations.&lt;ref name = Chapeu &gt;Sybille Chapeu, Des Chrétiens dans la Guerre d'Algérie: l'action de la mission de France, Éditions « Atelier Ed De L'», Paris, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1957, the organisation was raided and searched by police, who arrested and detained twelve Christians (among which priests) and twenty-three Muslims. Being one of the managers of the 'Social Centers', Mohamed Sahnoun was part of this group, which was charged with conspiracy and tried in a fairly loudly-trumpeted trial, nicknamed the “Progressive Christians” trial.&lt;ref name = Chapeu/&gt; Mohamed Sahnoun was subsequently detained in the infamous "{{ill|Villa Sésini|fr}}", the torture and detention centre of the [[1st Foreign Parachute Regiment]] during the [[Battle of Algiers (1956–57)|Battle of Algiers]]. He himself was subjected to torture.&lt;ref&gt;''Les ennemis complémentaires: guerre d'Algérie'', par Germaine Tillon, Éditions Tirésias, 2005, {{p.|216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released for lack of conclusive evidence, Mohamed Sahnoun then sought refuge in metropolitan France, in [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine|Clichy]] then in Switzerland in [[Lausanne]]. He was unable to go back to Algeria before independence.

During his early years Mohamed Sahnoun also got acquainted with the pacifist NGO [[Service Civil International]] in Algeria in 1952–53; he participated in several of their international workcamps and even became the head of their Algerian branch for some time. This provided him with an enduring philosophical background (see infra) and also with an important network of trusted friends who would be of great assistance to him through the events of the 1950s. Mohamed Sahnoun then resumed his studies at [[New York University]] where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master of Arts degrees, both in political science.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Diplomatic career ==

===At the service of Algeria===
Mohamed Sahnoun first became diplomatic advisor of the [[Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic]]. In 1962 he travelled with [[Ahmed Ben Bella|president Ben Bella]] on his first official visit to the USA, where he met with [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy|president John Kennedy]] who had been one of the supporters of the cause of Algerian independence.  As the Algerian delegation was then due to travel to [[Cuba]], Kennedy showed Ben Bella the first secret pictures taken by [[Lockheed U-2|U2 planes]] showing [[Cuban Missile Crisis|Russian missiles launch pads in Cuba]]. In the name of peace and human security, Ben Bella agreed to convey a message to [[Fidel Castro]] making clear how much the American regarded this situation as a ''casus belli''&lt;ref&gt;''Ainsi était le "Che"'' par Ahmed Ben Bella, Le Monde diplomatique, novembre 1997 [http://www.mai68.org/textes/lecheparbenbella/benbella.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;Interview de Mohamed Sahnoun par Katherine Marshall dans le Huffington Post le 10 mai 2011 [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/katherine-marshall/mohamed-sahnoun-interview-healing-memories_b_993262.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Mohamed Sahnoun then held the following positions:
*Deputy Secretary-General of the [[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) (1964–1973)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/people/mohamed-sahnoun|title=Mohamed Sahnoun|website=berkleycenter.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Deputy Secretary-General of the [[League of Arab States]] in charge of Arab-Africa dialogue (1973–1975).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
*Algerian Ambassador to [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (1975–1979)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Algerian Ambassador to France (1979–1982). Under his leadership, an agreement was reached between France and Algeria regarding social security and retirement settlement for Algerian workers in France.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
*Head of the Algerian diplomatic mission to the United States (1982–1984)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Algerian Ambassadeur d'Algérie to the United States (1984–1989). During his tenure, he organised a state visit by president [[Chadli Bendjedid]] to Ronald Reagan, the first official visit ever of an Algerian head of state to the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*In 1989, Sahnoun is called to take over urgently as Algeria's Ambassador to [[Morocco]], in order to succeed ambassadeur [[Abdelhamid Mehri]], who is himself urgently requested to take the presidency of [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] after the [[1988 October riots]] in Algeria; he becomes simultaneously Algerian Ambassador to Morocco and secretary of the [[Arab Maghreb Union]] (1989–1990).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
*His name was mentioned as a possible recourse candidate for the [[Algerian presidential election, 1999|Algerian presidential election of April 1999]] but it is finally [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], a former foreign minister who had retired from public office since 1981, who stood as a " free candidate " for and from [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]].&lt;ref name = naylor&gt;Phillip C. Naylor, Historical Dictionary of Algeria, Scarecrow Press, Oxford, 2006 ; {{p.|400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== At the service of the United Nations ===
*Senior Adviser to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED).&lt;ref name=ONU&gt;Source : United Nations press release, 27 January 1997, last consulted 7 March 2015 [https://www.un.org/press/en/1997/19970127.sga626.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to Somalia (April to November 1992).&lt;ref name=ONU/&gt; In this position, the efficiency of his diplomatic style is unanimously recognised and promising results are achieved;&lt;ref name = naylor/&gt; however his peacebuilding action was interrupted by the lack of efficient backing from the UN&lt;ref&gt;In his book entitled "Somalia: The Missed Opportunities", Mohamed Sahnoun clearly showed that when the United Nations tried to provide [[humanitarian assistance]], they were totally outperformed by NGOs, whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the United Nations' excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies, their main Somalia envoys operating from the safety of their desks in Nairobi. The refusal of [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], then [[UN Secretary General]] to accept this criticism led to the early end of Mohamed Sahnoun's mission in Somalia&lt;/ref&gt; and by the US military impatience to intervene. Mohamed Sahnoun resigned in protest. The intervention led by the US-backed [[Unified Task Force]] (code-named Operation Restore Hope) actually ended in utter disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Interview of Mohamed Sahnoun et [[Cornelio Sommaruga]] by Richard Werly and François d'Alançon, in ''Oser la Paix'', Éditions Autrement, Paris, 2011, {{ISBN|978-2-7467-3053-3}}, p. XVI.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the OAU in the Congo (1993).&lt;ref name=ONU/&gt;
*Special Adviser to the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for the Culture of Peace Programme (1995–1997).&lt;ref name=ONU/&gt;
*United Nations/[[Organization of African Unity]] (OAU) Special Representative for the Great Lakes region of Africa (1997).&lt;ref name=ONU/&gt;

==Studies and reports==
*Mohamed Sahnoun was a member of the [[Brundtland Commission]] on environment and development and co-author of the [[Our Common Future|Brundtland report]], which coined the expression [[sustainable development]] and its definition.  
*Co-chair with [[Gareth John Evans|Gareth Evans]] of the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]] (ICISS), whose report, entitled '’The Responsibility to Protect'’ was published in December 2001 with the support of the [[Canadian government]]. (Following the [[Rwanda genocide]], the [[Canadian government]] established the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]] (ICISS) in September 2000 under the joint presidency of [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]] and Mohamed Sahnoun. In February 2001, the ICISS suggested the phrase "responsibility to protect" as a way to avoid the "right to intervene" or "obligation to intervene" doctrines and yet keep a degree of duty to act to resolve humanitarian crises.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, Steven; Kassimeris, George, ed. (2010), "Chapter 18, Humanitarian Intervention: Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and the Use of Force", The Ashgate research companion to modern warfare, Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing Ltd, pp. 307–329, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-7410-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Pearson fellow with the International Development Research Centre in Ottawa, Canada (1994).&lt;ref name=ONU/&gt;
*Member of the Special Advisory Group of the War-torn Societies Project, a joint endeavour of the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) and of and the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva.&lt;ref name=ONU/&gt;

==Books==
*In 1994, Mohamed Sahnoun published "Somalia: The Missed Opportunities",&lt;ref&gt;USIP Press Books, octobre 1994, {{ISBN|978-1-878379-35-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention in [[Somalia]]; he shows in particular that, between the start of the Somali civil war in 1988 and the fall of the [[Siad Barre]] regime in January 1991, the United Nations missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies. When the United Nations tried to provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by NGOs, whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the United Nations' excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies. If radical reform was not undertaken, warned Mohamed Sahnoun, then the United Nations would continue to respond to such crisis in a climate of inept improvisation.&lt;ref&gt;Book Review by Gail M. Gerhart in ''Foreign Affairs'', March/April 1995 [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/50763/gail-m-gerhart/somalia-the-missed-opportunities]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2007, Mohamed Sahnoun also published (in French) a largely autobiographic novel set in [[Algeria]] in 1954, ''Mémoire blessée'' ('’Hurt Memory'’); its main character, Salem, '’a man of faith and dialogue'’, is jailed and tortured because of his convictions. He is however rescued by French people, some civilian, some military and some ecclesiactic – who all take great risks to shield him.  The book is clearly an evocation of the events which marked the author's younger years (see above the early years and Algeria wars section), but it also calls for human solidarity and the protection of the weaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|fr|Mémoire blessée : Algérie, 1957}}; Presses de la Renaissance, Paris, 2007, {{ISBN|978-2750902988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Mohamed Sahnoun met [[pacifism]] in 1952 in Alger through the [[Service Civil International]] NGO.  He had read the book by [[Pierre Ceresole]], the Swiss founder of this organisation, and even more importantly the book by [[Romain Rolland]] on [[Gandhi]], "which was practically my bedside book at the time.&lt;ref name=SCI&gt;Interview dans Breaking down barriers 1945–1975, 30 years of voluntary service for peace with [[Service Civil International]], Olivier Bertrand, Paris, 2008 (in French) [http://www.archives.sciint.org/sahnoun-mohamed_fr]&lt;/ref&gt;"
These ideas stayed with him through his long professional career, where he was from the onset a man of dialogue, trying for instance to establish appropriate communication between communities about [[Congo-Kinshasa|Congo]] through the UNESCO-backed World Assembly of Youth (WAY), or as a leading figure of the [[OAU]], particularly when African countries were confronted with the problems stemming from the borders inherited from [[colonialism]], or in his different missions for the UN.
His participation for several years in the very international and religiously mixed [[Service Civil International]] NGO also played a role in his understanding the sources of conflict and brought him to invest in how to heal the memory injuries resulting from past conflicts.&lt;ref name=SCI/&gt; 
He reinforces further this reflection in his later career years as he more and more commits in favour of human security, for instance though ''The Responsibility to Protect'' project (2001) or through his organizing from 2008 to 2012 of the Caux Forum for Human Security, with the following five themes: Healing Memory, Just Governance, Living Sustainably, Inclusive Economics and Intercultural Dialogue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cauxforum.net/about/holistic#sthash.iBxTC4QC.dpuf|title=Holistic Approach {{!}} Caux Forum for Human Security|website=www.cauxforum.net|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Very committed to interreligious diversity and dialogue, Mohamed Sahnoun rose strongly against the idea of [[Clash of Civilizations]], saying for example: "I said to [[Samuel P. Huntington|Huntington]] during a discussion in Washington, there is no such clash. Take the Somalian example: from a religious point of view, Somalis are more or less all on the same wavelength. But because of total insecurity, they split into clans and sub-clans. That's why I want to develop intercultural and inter-religious dialogue. "&lt;ref name = Le_Temps/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4002">'''Motivating operation''' ('''MO''') is a [[behaviorism|behavioristic]] concept introduced by [[Jack Michael]] in 1982. It is used to explain variations in the effects in the consequences of behavior.  Most importantly, a MO affects how strongly the person is reinforced or punished by the consequences of their behavior. For example, food deprivation is a motivating operation; if a person is hungry, food is strongly reinforcing, but if a person is satiated, food is less reinforcing. &lt;ref&gt;Laraway, S., Snycerski, S., Michael, J., &amp; Poling. (2003). Motivating operations and terms to describe them: some further refinements. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis. 36. 407-414.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Laraway suggested subdividing MOs into those that increase the reinforcing or punishing effects of a stimulus, which are termed establishing operations, and MOs that decrease the reinforcing or punishing effects of a stimulus, which are termed abolishing operations.

==Theory==
The concept of motivating operation deals with the observation that behavior depends not only on the stimuli present in the current situation and the organism's past experience with those stimuli, but also on the organism's recent past history of deprivation, satiation, pain, or other such influences. Such a past history can have two effects: it can change the value of a consequence by making it more or less reinforcing, and/or it can change the probability of behaviors that have produced that consequence. For example, food deprivation changes the value of food, making it more reinforcing, and it also evokes learned behaviors that have obtained food. Likewise, food satiation reduces the both the reinforcing effect of food and the probability of food-getting behaviors.

Note that a motivating operation differs from a discriminative stimulus (Sd). A discriminative stimulus signals the availability of reinforcement, while a motivating operation changes the effectiveness of a reinforcer.&lt;ref&gt;Michael, J. (1982) Distinguishing between discriminative and motivational functions of stimuli. Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior. 37. 149-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine main '''unconditioned''' (i.e. not learned) motivating operations, have been identified in humans. Deprivation of food, water, sleep, activity, or oxygen; becoming too warm or too cold; and increase of a painful stimulus all function as establishing operations for related behaviors, and increase the effect of positive or negative reinforcement related to them. Conversely, being satiated with food, water, sleep, activity, oxygen and sex; getting cooler after being too warm or warmer after too cold; and decrease of a  painful stimulus all function as abolishing operations for related behavior and reinforcement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applied Behavior Analysis|last = Cooper|first = John O|publisher = Pearson Education|year = 2007|isbn = 0-13-129327-3|location = Upper Saddle River, NJ, USA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also '''conditioned''' motivating operations that result from the learning history of the organism. Three kinds of conditioned operations have been identified: a '''surrogate''', '''reflexive''', and '''transitive'''.  A surrogate MO has the same effect as the MO it was paired with when it was learned; a reflexive MO acts as a reinforcement when it is removed; a transitive MO make something else effective as reinforcement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It should be noted that there is some debate as to whether an organism can be deprived or satiated from conditioned reinforcers.

==Theoretical note==
The concept of motivational operations has been applied to [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, A. (1943). A theory of human motivation. Psychological Review, Vol 50(4). 370-396. doi: 10.1037/40054346.&lt;/ref&gt; by describing the lower two levels as involving unconditioned MOs and the upper three levels as involving conditioned MOs.

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Muri'''''|[[wikt:無理|無理]]}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word meaning "unreasonableness; impossible; beyond one's power; too difficult; by force; perforce; forcibly; compulsorily; excessiveness; immoderation",&lt;ref&gt;''Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary'' (2003), 5th edition, Tokyo: Kenkyusha, p. 2537.&lt;/ref&gt; and is a key concept in the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS) as one of the three types of waste (''[[muda (Japanese term)|muda]]'', ''[[mura (Japanese term)|mura]]'', ''muri'').&lt;ref name = emiliani-better-thinking&gt;{{cite book | title = Better thinking, better results: case study and analysis of an enterprise-wide lean transformation | first1 = Bob  | last1 = Emiliani  | first2 = David | last2 = Stec | first3 = Lawrence  | last3 = Grasso  | first4 = James | last4 = Stodder | location =  Kensington, Conn  | publisher = Center for Lean Business Management | year = 2007 | edition = 2nd | ISBN = 978-0-9722591-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avoidance of muri in Toyota manufacturing==
Muri is one of three types of waste ([[muda (Japanese term)|muda]], [[mura (Japanese term)|mura]], muri) identified in the [[Toyota Production System]]. Waste reduction is an effective way to increase profitability.

Muri can be avoided through ''standardized work''.  To achieve this a ''standard condition'' or output must be defined to assure effective judgment of quality.  Then every process and function must be reduced to its simplest elements for examination and later recombination.
The process must then be standardized to achieve the standard condition. This is done by taking simple work elements and combining them, one-by-one into standardized work sequences.  In manufacturing, this includes:
* Work flow, or logical directions to be taken,
* Repeatable process steps and machine processes, or rational methods to get there, and
* [[Takt time]] (combined with production/demand leveling to provide for reasonable lengths of time and endurance allowed for a process e.g. if the takt is 10 minutes while there is no realistic way for a process to do its work in less than 20 minutes, Muri is the natural outcome).

When everyone knows the standard condition, and the standardized work sequences, the results observed include:
* Heightened employee morale (due to close examination of ergonomics and safety)
* Higher quality
* Improved productivity
* Reduced costs

== Implementation ==

In fact{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} the big contribution of [[Henry Ford]] and his manufacturing techniques was the reduction of Muri and not so much the [[production line]] itself. In order for the production line to function each station on the line had to achieve standard work because the next station was only equipped to work on standard condition components.

The Ford production line approximates to an implementation of [[Takt time]] which gives enough time to perform the standard work...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11241">The "'''Peaceful Evolution" theory''' in international political thought refers to the alleged attempt to effect a political transformation of the Chinese [[socialism|socialist system]] by peaceful means, primarily by the United States. 

The phrase was formulated by [[United States Secretary of State]] [[John Foster Dulles]] during the [[Cold War]] in the 1950s chiefly in the context of the Soviet Union, but has not subsequently featured in official discussions of U.S. China policy. Chinese analyses of U.S. foreign policy, however, hold that it has constituted part of the theoretical foundation for the United States' relations with the [[People's Republic of China]] since then.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/NA11Ad02.html|title = Hu warns successors over 'peaceful evolution'|date = January 11, 2012|accessdate = June 8, 2014|website = Asia Times Online|publisher = |last = Wu|first = Zhong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the thesis, the United States maintains a strategy to infiltrate and subvert socialist countries, notably China, by spreading Western political ideas and lifestyles, inciting discontent, and encouraging groups to challenge the Party leadership. The hoped for aim of this process, according to Chinese readings of the alleged policy, is that the socialist system is transformed from within.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = China's response to the downfall of Communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union|last = Zhang|first = Jialin|publisher = Hoover Press, Stanford University|year = 1994|isbn = |location = |pages = 6–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) has resisted the idea of Peaceful Evolution, beginning when the idea was first raised in the Mao era. The Party sees such a process as "the biggest threat to its continuous rule".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Successive generations of CPC leaders have struggled against the Peaceful Evolution theory, including [[Mao Zedong]], [[Deng Xiaoping]], [[Hu Jintao]], and [[Jiang Zemin]]. The theory is not currently part of the United States' official policy approach to the PRC, but communist military strategists consider it a [[Silent Contest|cause of ongoing concern]].

== Origins ==
The precise locution "peaceful evolution" was a modification, by John Foster Dulles, of the doctrine originally outlined by [[George F. Kennan]], who, in his [[Long Telegram]] of February 22, 1946, proposed that the socialist and capitalist blocs could reach a state of "peaceful coexistence."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Great Walls of Discourse and Other Adventures in Cultural China|last = Saussy|first = Haun|publisher = Harvard Univ Asia Center|year = 2001|isbn = |location = |pages = 237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was augmented by Dulles over a decade later, in speeches of 1957-58, to "promoting peaceful evolution towards democracy."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In a speech, Dulles referred to "the use of peaceful means" to "accelerate the evolution of government policies within the Sino-Soviet bloc" in order to "shorten the expected life span of communism."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = China's Security Interests in the Post-Cold War Era|last = Ong|first = Russell|publisher = Routledge|year = December 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = 117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western assistance and commerce were said to be two of the chief instruments of this plan to create a more liberal government in China.

According to Bo Yibo (father of ousted Politburo member Bo Xilai) Mao Zedong heard about Dulles's remarks and took them seriously, ordering top Party cadres to study the speeches.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Return of the Dragon: Rising China and Regional Security|last = Roy|first = Denny|publisher = Columbia University Press|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao saw the idea of Peaceful Evolution as a serious policy threat, a "much more deceptive tactic" to corrupt China, and a war against the socialist powers by military means.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Mao felt that the war was already being waged, with some effect, against the Soviet Union. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Chinese communists became more concerned about the strategy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Uses of the term ==
The term Peaceful Evolution has been used in the context of China and modernization outside the sphere of [[international relations]]. Scholars of China's media environment have used it to refer to the marketization of the press in China, where state control by the Communist Party lessens while the forces of commercialization take hold—though whether the media sphere in China has really evolved along such lines is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Power, Money, and Media: Communication Patterns and Bureaucratic Control in Cultural China|last = Lee|first = Chin-Chuan|publisher = Northwestern University Press;|year = 2000|isbn = 0810117878|location = |pages = 95–104|last2 = Pan|first2 = Zhongdang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Peaceful Evolution ideas are often attributed to the foes of China, observers have suggested that some officials in the Chinese communist system—such as [[Wen Jiabao]]—support the process. These allegedly reform-oriented officials, however, are not considered part of the Communist Party's mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-gardels/wei-jingsheng-blocking-pe_b_768579.html|title = Wei Jingsheng: Blocking 'Peaceful Evolution' Will Lead to Instability in China|date = October 19, 2010|accessdate = June 8, 2014|website = The World Post|publisher = The Huffington Post|last = Gardels|first = Nathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have argued that the typical Chinese uses of the term—as a conspiratorial plot—are too "vague and all embracing; its meaning ranges from dark conspiracies involving the alleged plotters of the counter revolutionary rebellion [a reference to the [[Tiananmen Square massacre]]] to the broad spectrum of cultural, social, and economic exchanges with the outside world."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The overall utility of the term for Chinese analysts is that it sums up a range of the threats to the regime's political security, faced by the Party in the post-Cold War era. These threats are mostly connected with the United States, and are seen as part of the United States' own foreign policy after the collapse of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

However, the term is now often used by Chinese scholars to condemn any foreign activities (including cultural, economic, social) that are seen as problematic for the Communist Party—not just those that are actually intended to undermine it. It is also used to dismiss out of hand United States criticism on the Chinese government's human rights record, on the theory that the West is simply attempting to undermine the Chinese people's respect for the Communist Party.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Post-Tiananmen massacre ===
Chinese sensitivities to the idea of a Peaceful Evolution strategy by foreign powers were heightened by the post-Tiananmen crackdown climate of 1989, and the series of regime collapses in Eastern Europe later that year. Initially, Chinese communist leaders deemed the regime changes in the European countries as an "internal affair." In their own meetings, however, they declared them a matter of foreign subversion, also known as peaceful evolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Wang Zhen sought to arm Chinese troops with the ideological shield to guard against Western idea—while on a military inspection tour of Xinjiang he said "unswervingly follow the socialist road... the road may be winding and the struggle fierce... In our opposition to peaceful evolution, a key tenet is to fortify the brains of the entire party with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Jiang Zemin, the Party leader after June 4, said that peaceful evolution posed a "major danger" for communist countries.

A three-part article was published in the ''People's Daily'' after the massacre titled "On Peaceful Evolution." It argued that the collapse of communist regimes in Europe were a result of "bourgeois liberalization," which refers to Peaceful Evolution, and that the democracy protests in China had also been an attempt to "negate party leadership by political pluralism, and negate public ownership in the economy by privatization." The CPC's crackdown was able to "crush the peaceful evolution strategy of the imperialists," according to scholar Jialin Zhang.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Perceptions in China ==
Among state-affiliated intellectuals and strategists in the PRC, the term and theory of Peaceful Evolution is a threat and an attempt to undermine the Communist Party's rule. The hard line scholar Huo Shiliang of the Chinese Academy of Social Science's says that after Dulles, the Americans' policy of attempting to peaceful transform China has simply accelerated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before June 4 China considered the United States as a trustworthy and friendly country, but since June 4 the United States has become the main source of instability in China. Peaceful evolution is the main threat to China's stability today. The ideological struggle will be the most important factor in future Sino-American relations. The U.S. will again become the major threat to China, but not a military one. The Taiwan problem will remain important. but the ideological struggle—particularly peaceful evolution—will be primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Beautiful Imperialist: China Perceives America, 1972-1990|last = Shambaugh|first = David|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1993|isbn = |location = |pages = 275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theory of Peaceful Evolution is a key part of Chinese official assessments of the collapse of the Soviet Union. In bracing themselves against the Americans' "soft power" approaches, and attempts to undermine the regime, they have advocated a series of countermeasures. According to Li Jingjie, the director of the former Soviet-Eastern Europe Institute at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, there are eight lessons that China must draw from the Soviet collapse, due in part to the infiltration of Peaceful Evolution:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = China's Communist Party: Atrophy and Adaptation|last = Shambaugh|first = David|publisher = University of California Press|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = 76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Jacobs was born in Montreal on 3 December 1939. His parents were both natives of [[New York City]]: Jacob Joseph Jacobs graduated from New York University as a chemical engineer and Francis Alexander graduated from Barnard College in ancient languages. His interest in nature and the landscape was nurtured during summer family trips to the ocean and others in the northern boreal forest. His commitment to the urban landscape was derived from his experience of the cultural diversity and convivial social energy of Montreal. He is married to Ellen Vineberg Jacobs, distinguished professor emerita of Concordia University in Montreal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.recherche.umontreal.ca/la-recherche-a-ludem/la-vitrine-des-professeurs/informations/chercheur/495/pid/16/|title=Portail de la recherche: Informations|website=www.recherche.umontreal.ca|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobs graduated from Antioch College with a bachelor's degree (1961) in engineering and fine arts. He continued his studies at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], where he obtained a Masters of Architecture degree (1964) followed by a Master of Landscape Architecture degree (1968).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; He then pursued a program of special studies in human ecology at Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiv.umontreal.ca/P0000/P0397.html|title=P0397 Fonds Peter Jacobs- Université de Montréal – Division de la gestion de documents et des archives|website=www.archiv.umontreal.ca|language=fr|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his studies, Jacobs pursued both an academic and professional career. After first practicing architecture, he concentrated on landscape planning and urban design. In 1971 he was promoted to associate professor and in 1979 to full professor in the School of Landscape Architecture, Universite de Montreal. He was the school's first director (1978) and the first associate dean of research of the Faculte de l’Amenagement (1977–1984).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web |title=P0397 Fonds Peter Jacobs- Université de Montréal – Division de la gestion de documents et des archives|url=http://www.archiv.umontreal.ca/P0000/P0397.html|last=Udem|first=Archives|website=www.archiv.umontreal.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; He was named Emeritus professor in 2016.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Peter Jacobs is Fellow and past president of the [[Canadian Society of Landscape Architects]] (CSLA) (1978–1980), Fellow of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA), and served as the Canadian delegate to the [[International Federation of Landscape Architects]] (IFLA) (1986–1995). In 2016, he was named Chair of the Montreal Heritage Council.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/article/2016/12/02/peter-jacobs-nomme-a-la-presidence-du-conseil-du-patrimoine-de-montreal/|title=Peter Jacobs nommé à la présidence du Conseil du patrimoine de Montréal|date=2017-03-17|access-date=2017-04-03|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main achievements and contributions ==

=== Pedagogical development of a new field of studies ===
Jcobs' teaching is based on the structure and meaning of the urban and rural landscape as well as the use of criteria such as belonging, equity, and integrity in the design of landscape form. Due to his expertise, Peter Jacobs has been invited to evaluate numerous academic programs in Canada, Israel, Columbia, France, China and Spain. He has also given intensive courses and design studios in more than 50 universities around the world.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

His research and community activities have focused on the sustainable and equitable development and conservation of the landscape in association with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with the Kativik Environmental Quality Commission as Chair of the Commission (KEQC) since 1979,&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mddelcc.gouv.qc.ca/evaluations/cqek.htm|title=Commission de la qualité de l'environnement Kativik (CQEK)|website=www.mddelcc.gouv.qc.ca|language=fr|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as Chair of the Public Advisory Council for the Canadian State of the Environment Report (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of Canada's Environment|last=|first=|publisher=Government of Canada, Canada Communication Group|year=1991|isbn=0-660-14237-6|location=the University of California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early stages of environmental evaluation ===
Jacobs was one of the early participants in a variety of environmental evaluation formats related to urban development and the North, both as a chair and a member of numerous public commissions. He chaired the public consultation process on the future of Lancaster Sound in the Canadian arctic (1980) and has Chaired the Kativik Environmental Quality Commission in [[Nunavik]] (since 1981).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; He also co-Chaired the public hearings related to the environmental impacts of the [[James Bay Hydroelectric Project|Great Whale Hydoelectric Project]] flowing into [[James Bay]], Quebec (1992–1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nunavik : un environnement en évolution|last=Jacobs|first=Peter|last2=Berrouard|first2=Daniel|last3=Paul|first3=Mireille|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Commission de la qualité de l’environnement Kativik|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the urban context, he has participated as a commissioner for the Bureau de consultation de Montreal and the Office de consultation Publique de Montreal on files related to the development of urban neighborhoods, urban infrastructure, and the planning and design of large metropolitan parks and nature reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ocpm.qc.ca/commissaire/peter-jacobs|title=Peter Jacobs|date=2015-12-14|work=OCPM|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In 1990, as a member of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Research Council (CEARC), he co-edited and was one of the chief architects of a research report on ''Sustainable Development and Environmental Assessment : Perspectives on Planning for a Common Future''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sustainable Development and Environmental Assessment : Perspectives on Planning for a Common Future|last=Jacobs|first=Peter|last2=Sadler|first2=Barry|publisher=Canadian Environmental Assessment Research Council|year=1988|isbn=|location=Hull, Quebec|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, he has served as a consultant for programs sponsored by [[UNESCO]], MAB, UNU, and [[IUCN protected area categories|IUCN]].

=== Relationship of landscape and culture ===
One of the principal research fields developed by Jacobs is linked to the impact of culture and cultural values to the perception and management of landscapes. Numerous international missions in Africa, Latin America, Australia, and Europe as well as the arctic landscapes of Northern Quebec have provided a rich array of conditions and experiences that contribute to a diversity of cultural perspectives as to how the landscape is perceived and managed.

His prolonged research visits to Dumbarton Oaks as chair of the Senior Fellows of the Landscape and Garden Studies program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doaks.org/research/garden-landscape|title=Garden and Landscape Studies  — Dumbarton Oaks|last=admin|website=www.doaks.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and subsequently as Beatrix Farrand Distinguished Fellow provided further material with which to evaluate the diverse cultural visions of the landscape.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doaks.org/library-archives/dumbarton-oaks-archives/historical-records/oral-history-project/peter-jacobs|title=Peter Jacobs — Dumbarton Oaks|last=gabrielas|website=www.doaks.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community service ===
Jacobs' commitment to the community is marked by his desire to integrate professional practice with academic research in the service of community growth and development. As chair of the Environmental Planning Commission&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; from 1978–1990, he helped formulate nature conservation programs and action plans for numerous countries. His environmental activities have focused on nature conservancy, the preservation of urban open space, and the development of policy, programs, and plans in support of equitable and sustainable development.

He has served as vice-president of the Solomon Schecter Academy (1973–1976), advisor to the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, member of the intercultural advisory committee of the City of Montreal, and president of the Jewish Public Library of Montreal(1996–2000)&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.federationcja.org/media/singles/1191342115.pdf|title=Rapport Annuel|last=Federation CJA|first=|date=2006–2007|website=www.federationcja.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also served as Chair of the community planning and allocations committee and as a Director of the Federation of Jewish Community Agencies, the United Israel Agencies of Canada and the Canadian Jewish National Fund.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

{{Contract law}}
The '''posting rule''' (or '''mailbox rule''' in the United States, also known as the "postal rule" or "deposited acceptance rule") is an exception to the general rule of [[contract law]] in [[common law]] countries that [[offer and acceptance|acceptance of an offer]] takes place when communicated.  Under the posting rule, that acceptance takes effect when a letter is posted (that is, dropped in a [[post box]] or handed to a postal worker).&lt;ref&gt;The post office will be the [[universal service]] provider, such as the [[Royal Mail]] or [[Australia Post]] or [[United States Postal Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[plain English]], the "meeting of the minds" necessary to contract formation occurs at the exact moment word of acceptance is ''sent'' via post by the person accepting it, rather than when that acceptance is ''received'' by the person who offered the contract.

The rules of contracts by post (postal rules) include the following:
# An offer made by post/letter is not effective until received by the offeree.
# Acceptance is effective as soon as it is posted.
# For revocation to be effective, it must be received by the offeree before they post their letter of acceptance.

One rationale given for the rule is that the offeror nominates the post office as his or her implied agent, and thus receipt of the acceptance by the post office is regarded as receipt by the offeror. The main effect of the posting rule is that the risk of acceptance being delivered late or lost in the post is placed upon the offeror. If the offeror is reluctant to accept this risk, he can always expressly require actual receipt as a condition before being legally bound by his offer.

==English case law==

The rule was established by a series of 19th century cases, starting with ''[[Adams v Lindsell]]'' (1818) B &amp; Ald 681, which was later confirmed and expanded in ''[[Dunlop v Higgins]]'' (1848) 1 HL Cas 381, ''[[Household Fire and Carriage Accident Insurance Co Ltd v Grant]]'' (1879) 4 Ex D 216 and ''[[Henthorn v Fraser]]'' [1892] 2 Ch 27.

The posting rule applies only to acceptance.  Other contractual letters (such as one revoking the offer) do not take effect until the letter is delivered, as in ''[[Stevenson, Jacques &amp; Co v McLean]]'' (1880) 5 QBD 346. The implication of this is that it is possible for a letter of acceptance to be posted after a letter of revocation of the offer has been posted but before it is delivered, and acceptance will be complete at the time that the letter of acceptance was posted—the offeror's revocation would be inoperative.

Example 1:
* Day 1: A makes an offer to B.
* Day 2: A decides to revoke the offer and puts a letter in the mail to B revoking the offer.
* Day 3: B puts a letter accepting the offer in the mail. 
* Day 4: B receives A's revocation letter.
:* The letter of revocation can be effective only when received, that is Day 4.
:* However, a contract was formed on Day 3 when the letter of acceptance was posted.
:* It is too late for A to revoke the offer.

Example 2:
* Day 1: A makes an offer to B.
* Day 2: B intends to ''reject'' the offer by putting a letter in the mail to A rejecting the offer. 
* Day 3: B changes his mind and sends a [[fax]] to A accepting the offer.
:* In this situation, whichever communication A receives first will govern.

Example 3:
* Day 1: A makes an offer to sell a parcel of land to B.
* Day 2: B mails her acceptance.
* Day 3: Before A receives B's acceptance, B telephones A and states she wishes to reject the offer.
* Day 4: B's original letter of acceptance arrives, A then records the contract as a sale.
:* B's acceptance of the offer means there is a binding contract -- she is obliged to pay for the land or be liable for damages.
:* B is just rejecting the offer, she did not actually revoke her acceptance

Under the posting rule, performance is a means of acceptance. If A orders 1000 blue coathangers and B ships them out, that shipment is considered to be a conveyance of acceptance of A's offer to buy the coathangers. Defective performance is also an acceptance, unless accompanied by an explanation. For example, if A orders 1000 blue coathangers, and B mistakenly ships 1000 red coathangers, this is still an acceptance of the contract. However, if B ships the red coathangers with a note that they sent these because they had run out of blue coathangers, this is not an acceptance, but rather an [[Accommodation (law)|accommodation]], which is a form of [[counter-offer]].

An interesting implication of the operation of the posting rule is that an acceptance is complete once the letter of acceptance is posted; it makes no difference whether the offeror actually receives the letter. This was demonstrated in ''[[Byrne v Van Tienhoven]]'' (1880) 5 CPD 344. If a letter of acceptance were to be lost, acceptance has still taken place.  An exception to this would be if the [[offeree]] knows or has reason to know that the letter of acceptance never reached the [[offeror]]. For example, if A brings a letter of acceptance to the local post office and A sees the post office burn down a moment later, there is no acceptance.

Further the posting rule does not apply to instantaneous forms of communications.  For example, in ''[[Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corporation]]'' [1955] 2 QB 327, the Court held that the posting rule did not apply to an acceptance by [[telex]] as the Court regarded it as an instantaneous form of communication. The general principle that acceptance takes place when communicated applies to instantaneous forms of communication. Courts have similarly held that the posting rule does apply to acceptances by [[telephone]] or [[fax]]. 

The courts are yet to decide whether [[e-mail]] should be regarded as an instantaneous form of communication. If the offeree were to convey acceptance by commercially ''un''reasonable means - by cross-country [[pony express]], for example - the acceptance would not be effective until it had actually been received.

A letter is regarded as "posted" only when it is in the possession of the [[Post Office]]; this was established in the case of ''[[Re London &amp; Northern Bank]]'' [1900] 1 Ch 220. A letter of acceptance is not considered "posted" if it is handed to an agent to deliver, such as a courier. This is not the case under the Uniform Commercial Code.

The posting rule does '''not''' apply to option contracts or irrevocable offers where acceptance is still effective only upon receipt. This is because the offeree no longer needs protection against subsequently mailed revocations of the offer.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Where parties are at distance from one another, and an offer is sent by mail, it is universally held in this country [United States] that the reply accepting the offer may be sent through the same medium, and, if it is so sent, the contract will be complete when the acceptance is mailed,...and beyond the acceptor's control; the theory being that, when one makes an offer through the mail, he authorizes the acceptance to be made through the same medium his agent to receive his acceptance; that the acceptance, when mailed, is then constructively communicated to the offeror.

–Excerpt of an opinion by Judge Kimmelman (718 A.2d 1223)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==American case law==

In the United States, the majority rule is that the mailbox rule does not apply to [[option contracts]].  By default, an option contract is accepted when the offeror receives the acceptance, not when the offeree mails it.  However, because the [[California Civil Code]] applies the mailbox rule to all contracts, California follows the minority rule, under which the mailbox rule also applies to [[option contract]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3879211402999684820 ''Palo Alto Town &amp; Country Village, Inc. v. BBTC Company''], 11 Cal. 3d 494, 113 Cal. Rptr. 705, 521 P.2d 1097 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian case law==
In ''Tallerman &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Nathan's Merchandise'' (1957) 98 CLR 93, 111-112&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studymode.com/essays/Tallerman-Co-Pty-Ltd-v-135644.html Tallerman &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Nathan's Merchandise'' (1957) 98 CLR 93]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Dixon|Dixon CJ]] and Fullagar J took a more restrictive view. "The general rule is that a contract is not completed until acceptance of an offer is actually communicated to the offeror, and a finding that a contract is completed by the posting of a letter of acceptance cannot be justified unless it is to be inferred that the offeror contemplated and intended that his offer might be accepted by the doing of that act." The High Court included the element of intention.

==Civil law jurisdictions==
Civil law jurisdictions do not follow the postal rule. The classical civil law position is that acceptance, like any expression of will, can only be effective if it was communicated to the addressee, unless the lack of communication can be attributed to the latter.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Article 3:37 of the [[Dutch Civil Code]], Article 130 of the [[German Civil Code]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods|The Vienna Convention on the International Sale of Goods]] chooses a compromise between the two approaches: According to article 18(2) of the Convention, an acceptance is effective when it reaches the offeror. However, article 16(1) of the Convention provides for the most important consequence of the common law "posting rule", that is, an offer may not be revoked if the revocation reaches the offeree after it has dispatched an acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;See Articles 18 and 16(1) of the Vienna Convention&lt;/ref&gt;

==UNCITRAL model law==
{{main|United Nations Commission on International Trade Law}}
Many countries have enacted legislation based on the UNCITRAL Model Law of Electronic Commerce.  Such legislation is often entitled the Electronic Transactions Act.  Among other issues, this legislation deals a default rule for the time that email (electronic communications) is sent and when it is received.  However it is mistaken to suggest that it deals with a clarification of the postal acceptance rule for electronic communications. There are two schools of thought.

# Ask if the postal acceptance rule applies to emails (electronic communications). If your answer is yes, then the relevant Electronic Transaction Act (ETA) can help. The postal acceptance rule states that there is a contract when posted – so we should apply the "sent" rule under the ETA. If the answer is no; then either apply the "received" rule under the ETA or ignore it and use the contract rule of communication.
# Instead, treat the Electronic Transactions Act as an intended substitute and statutory replacement of the postal acceptance rule; in which case the "received" rule should apply. The problem with this second school of thought is that there is nothing in the Model Law of Electronic Commerce, nor the ETAs which suggests that it was intended to replace the postal acceptance rule. We are still waiting for a court to decide.

The UNCITRAL rules on time of sending and receiving are:
# Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the dispatch of a data message occurs when it enters an information system outside the control of the originator or of the person who sent the data message on behalf of the originator.
#  Unless otherwise agreed between the originator and the addressee, the time of receipt of a data message is determined as follows:
:: (a) if the addressee has designated an information system for the purpose of receiving data messages, receipt occurs:
::: (i) at the time when the data message enters the designated information system; or
::: (ii) if the data message is sent to an information system of the addressee that is not the designated information system, at the time when the data message is retrieved by the addressee;
:: (b) if the addressee has not designated an information system, receipt occurs when the data message enters an information system of the addressee.

'''Project Eagle''' is an interactive art demo of a colony on [[Mars]], developed by [[Blackbird Interactive]] in collaboration with [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/homeworld-deserts-of-kharaks-creators-worked-with-nasa-1792565700 |title=Homeworld: Deserts Of Kharak's Creators Worked With NASA On A Cool Mars Project |publisher=Kotaku.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on 27 November 2018, in honor of the successful ''[[InSight]]'' landing.

== Production ==

Project Eagle was built in the [[Unity (Game Engine)]] and utilizes design elements similar to that of the [[Real-time strategy|RTS]] game ''[[Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak]]'', including the sensors manager view and camera systems.

The Martian terrain was generated using [[radar]] data from NASA's [[HiRISE]] camera on board the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackbirdinteractive.com/news/project-eagle/ |title=Project Eagle |publisher=Blackbird Interactive |date=2017-02-22 |accessdate=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Project Eagle'' is set in 2117 in a hypothetical future after the first human colonists arrive on Mars in the year 2034 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcgamer.com/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak-devs-partner-with-nasa-to-build-interactive-mars-colony/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/02/22/dice-2017-homeworld-creators-reveal-project-eagle-in-collaboration-with-nasas-jpl&lt;/ref&gt; The fictional "Eagle Base" is located at the foot of [[Mount Sharp]] (Aeolis Mons), in Quad 51 of [[Aeolis Palus]] in [[Gale Crater]], near the site of the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]] landing. The ''Curiosity'' landing site is marked with a [[plinth]] in Project Eagle.&lt;ref&gt;http://ca.ign.com/articles/2017/02/22/dice-2017-homeworld-creators-reveal-project-eagle-in-collaboration-with-nasas-jpl&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''R (Begum) v Governors of Denbigh High School''''' [2006] is a [[House of Lords]] case on the legal regulation of religious symbols and dress under the [[Human Rights Act 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/15.html UKHL 15, House of Lords Decisions] Retrieved 2014-06-25&lt;/ref&gt;

The case involved Shabina Begum, a Muslim pupil at [[Denbigh High School, Luton|Denbigh High School]] in [[Luton]], UK, who sued her school.&lt;ref name="Emon2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFbWEPGx7SkC&amp;pg=PA291|title=Religious Pluralism and Islamic Law: Dhimmis and Others in the Empire of Law|author=Anver M.

==The case==
Shabina Begum ({{lang-bn|শবিনা বেগম}}; born in the UK, aged 16 at the time and of [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]] origin), was a pupil at [[Denbigh High School, Luton|Denbigh High School]] in [[Luton]], [[Bedfordshire]]. Four out of the six parent governors were Muslims, the Chair of the Luton Council of Mosques was a community governor and three of the LEA governors were also Muslims. However the school also contained a significant number of pupils of other faiths and the school wished to be inclusive in serving the needs of this diverse community and regarded the school uniform as promoting a sense of communal identity. In addition to uniforms incorporating trousers or skirts, female pupils are also offered a uniform based on the [[Pakistan]]i or [[Punjab region|Punjabi]] [[shalwar kameez]] with optional [[khimar]]. The school uniform was decided upon in consultation with local mosques, religious organisations and parents. The School considered the shalwar kameez ideal as it was worn by several faith groups and, accordingly, helped to minimise the differences between them.

For two years, Ms. Begum attended the school without complaint, wearing the shalwar kameez, but in September 2002, Ms. Begum, accompanied by her brother and another young male, went to the school and asked that she be allowed to wear the long coat-like garment known as the [[jilbāb]]. In the opinion of Begum and her supporters, the particular form of shalwar kameez offered by the school was relatively close-fitting with short sleeves, and was therefore not compliant with the requirements of [[Sartorial hijab|Islamic dress]] as they are stated in [[Sharia]] law. Shabina refused to attend for three years unless she was allowed to wear the jilbab to school. She said she believed that this was required by her [[Muslim]] faith, but also in contravention of the [[school uniform]] policy. In addition, the jilbab was, in the opinion of Begum and her supporters, a more culturally-neutral form of Islamic attire.

The school's supporters claimed that after Begum's parents had died, she had come under the undue influence of her brother Shuweb Rahman. They also argued that if Begum was allowed to attend classes wearing jilbab, other pupils would feel under pressure to adopt stricter forms of Islamic dress.{{fact?|date=December 2016}}

Begum, with her brother, issued a claim for judicial review of the school's decision not to allow her to wear the jilbab at school.  The claim was made on the grounds that the school had interfered with her right to manifest her religion (Article 9 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]) and her right to education (Article 2(1) of the first protocol).

==Judgment==

===Appeals===
Begum lost the case in the [[EWHC|High Court]], but later won on appeal to the [[EWCA|Court of Appeal]]. The school [[appeal]]ed against this decision, and the case was heard by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Judicial Committee of the House of Lords]]. The [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]] was allowed to make submissions in the hearing in the House of Lords.  The House of Lords ruled in favour of the school. Begum was represented in the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords by the former Prime Minister's wife [[Cherie Blair|Cherie Blair QC]].

===House of Lords===
[[Tom Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Lord Bingham of Cornhill]] stressed at the outset of his judgment that,

{{Cquote|this case concerns a particular pupil and a particular school in a particular place at a particular time.  It must be resolved on facts which are now, for purposes of the appeal, agreed.  The House is not, and could not be, invited to rule on whether Islamic dress, or any feature of Islamic dress, should or should not be permitted in the schools of this country.}}

The Law Lords took the view that a person's right to hold a particular religious belief was absolute (i.e. could not be interfered with), but that a person's right to manifest a particular religious belief was qualified (i.e. it could be interfered with if there was a justification).

Three of the five Law Lords held that Begum's rights had not been interfered with&lt;ref&gt;{{Halsbury|88A|School uniform, curriculum and discipline.|444|6}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Lord Bingham, [[Lord Scott of Foscote]] and [[Lord Hoffmann]]), and two held that they had ([[Lord Nicholls|Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead]] and [[Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond|Baroness Hale of Richmond]]).

All five agreed, however, that in this particular case there were justifiable grounds for interference, one of the grounds being to protect the rights of other female students at the school who would not wish to be pressured into adopting a more extreme form of dress.

'''Rhizome''' is a philosophical concept developed by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in their ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'' (1972–1980) project. It is what Deleuze calls an "image of thought," based on the [[rhizome|botanical rhizome]], that apprehends [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicities]].

==As a mode of knowledge and model for society==
Deleuze and Guattari use the terms "rhizome" and "rhizomatic" to describe theory and research that allows for multiple, non-hierarchical entry and exit points in data representation and interpretation. In ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'', they oppose it to an [[arborescent]] (hierarchic, tree-like) conception of knowledge, which works with dualist categories and binary choices. A rhizome works with planar and trans-species connections, while an arborescent model works with vertical and linear connections. Their use of the "orchid and the wasp" is taken from the biological concept of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], in which two different species interact together to form a [[multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]] (i.e. a unity that is multiple in itself). [[Hybridisation (biology)|Hybridization]] or [[horizontal gene transfer]] would also be good illustrations.

"As a model for culture, the rhizome resists the organizational structure of the root-tree system which charts causality along chronological lines and looks for the original source of 'things' and looks towards the pinnacle or conclusion of those 'things.' A rhizome, on the other hand, is characterized by 'ceaselessly established connections between semiotic chains, organizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts, sciences, and social struggles.' Rather than narrativize history and culture, the rhizome presents history and culture as a map or wide array of attractions and influences with no specific origin or genesis, for a 'rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo.' The planar movement of the rhizome resists chronology and organization, instead favoring a nomadic system of growth and propagation.

"In this model, culture spreads like the surface of a body of water, spreading towards available spaces or trickling downwards towards new spaces through fissures and gaps, eroding what is in its way. The surface can be interrupted and moved, but these disturbances leave no trace, as the water is charged with pressure and potential to always seek its equilibrium, and thereby establish smooth space."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhizomes.net/issue5/poke/glossary.html Rhizomes.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

Deleuze and Guattari introduce ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' by outlining the concept of the rhizome (quoted from ''A Thousand Plateaus''):

*1 and 2. Principles of connection and heterogeneity: "...any point of a rhizome can be connected to any other, and must be";
*3. Principle of multiplicity: it is only when the multiple is effectively treated as a substantive, "multiplicity", that it ceases to have any relation to the One;
*4. Principle of asignifying rupture: a rhizome may be broken, but it will start up again on one of its old lines, or on new lines;
*5 and 6. Principle of cartography and [[decalcomania]]: a rhizome is not amenable to any structural or generative model; it is a "map and not a tracing".

'''Roscoe Dunjee''' (1883–1965) was an American civil rights activist, journalist, and editor in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. He founded the ''[[Black Dispatch]]'' in 1915, the first black newspaper in Oklahoma City, and used it as a platform to support civil rights and reveal injustices. Long active in the local chapter of the NAACP, in 1932 he brought together several chapters to found the state chapter or branch of the [[NAACP]]. He served as its president for 16 years, and was also on the national board of the NAACP.

Dunjee was a leader in Oklahoma City, using his newspaper to advance racial integration in housing, university admission, education, transportation and other public accommodations. He worked for fair jury selection and against lynchings.&lt;ref name=Sheeler /&gt;

==Early life==
Roscoe Dunjee was born June 21, 1883 in [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], [[Jefferson County, West Virginia]].&lt;ref name=Sheeler&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheeler|first1=Reuben|title=Dunjee, Roscoe (1883–1965)|url=http://www.blackpast.org/saw/dunjee-roscoe-1883-1965|website=Black Past|accessdate=7 Feb 2015}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Reverend [[John Dunjee|John William]], who worked at [[Storer College]], a historically black college,, and his mother was Lydia Ann Dunjee.&lt;ref name=Rummel&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rummel|first1=Jack|title=African American Social Leaders and Activists|date=2003|publisher=Facts on File Inc|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780816048403|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His family migrated to Oklahoma in 1892, as his father was representing the [[Baptist Home Missionary Society]]. Roscoe had a brother, Irving, and three sisters, Ella, [[Drusilla Dunjee Houston|Drusilla]], and Blanche. In 1903, when the young Dunjee was 20&lt;ref name="Sullins, William S"&gt;{{cite web|title=Roscoe Dunjee and the Oklahoma City Black Dispatch|url=http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/handle/2097/10618|website=Kansas state University Libraries|publisher=Sullins, William S|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; their father died.

He returned from [[Langston University|Langston College]], a [[historically black college]] in [[Langston, Oklahoma]] that then emphasized technical and industrial trades. Dunjee had learned to set type by working after hours in the print shop of ''The Langston Herald,'' a small community paper.&lt;ref name=Rummel /&gt; Dunjee took on the responsibility of earning a living to support his mother and a younger brother and sister. The family farm had produced vegetables for the family. Young Dunjee decided to enlarge the operation and become a truck farmer, selling directly to the public. He also worked as a bellhop at the Stewart Hotel in Oklahoma City, but looked for more opportunities. He educated himself also by reading widely in his father's 1500-volume library.

==Career==
Interested in the growing movement of black fraternalism, Dunjee joined the [[Pythian Grand Lodge]] and began lecturing in its behalf throughout the state. He also enlisted new members, and his reputation as an organizer grew. When Dunjee was traveling throughout Oklahoma, he could see the difficult conditions of black migrant sharecroppers and tenant farmers. Not only was the Negro unable to earn a living wage, the state had passed discriminatory laws related to segregation of transportation and other public accommodations. Dunjee began thinking seriously about establishing a newspaper that could tell the Negro story and reply to white racism.

In 1915, when he was 32 years of age,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roscoe Dunjee on education|url=http://hdl.handle.net/11244/4927|website=open-access repository of research by members of Oklahoma Higher Education|publisher=Hadley,Worth J.|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had a chance to purchase a job printing plant from Oliva J. Abby, an instructor in the Oklahoma City public schools, whose printer husband had become ill. He founded his own newspaper, the ''[[Black Dispatch]]'', the first black newspaper in Oklahoma City. He used this as a platform to publish editorials against segregation and report unfair treatment of blacks. The newspaper grew from a local publication to a national one, at one point boasting nearly 20,000 subscribers. Dunjee would regularly report on [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings of blacks]] in both Oklahoma and Texas.

He worked to change voter laws that prohibited or constrained black voters from the polls. Oklahoma's new 1908 constitution, passed after statehood, had raised barriers to voter registration, effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising blacks and other minority]] voters. It joined former states of the Confederacy across the South in taking such action. In 1916 the state passed a [[grandfather clause]] that enabled white voters to escape certain restrictions related to literacy. Dunjee's efforts contributed to court challenges; ultimately lawyers of the NAACP ([[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]]) overturned the grandfather clause in the US Supreme Court case ''[[Guinn v. Allwright]]''.

Dunjee publicized the murder trial of [[Hollins v. State of Oklahoma|Jess Hollins]]. He was a black man arrested for the rape of a white woman, to which he confessed without having seen counsel. He was rapidly sentenced to death four days after the alleged attack in December 1931. Dunjee reported on the case, supporting an appeal. The judge said he moved fast because he feared another [[Tulsa Race Riot]], as had taken place in 1921. The state court ruled that Hollins deserved a jury trial. He was convicted by an [[all-white jury]] in 1934 and again sentenced to death. The case was appealed to the US Supreme Court, which ruled in ''[[Hollins v. State of Oklahoma]]'' (1935), that the systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury had been grounds for reversing Hollins' conviction.&lt;ref name=Rummel /&gt; It directed a new trial. Hollins was convicted by another all-white jury and sentenced to life in prison. He died in 1950, and is now widely believed to have been innocent.

In 1916 the Oklahoma Board of Commissioners passed an ordinance forbidding black residents from moving into a house on a block occupied by at least 75% white residents. Dunjee funded the cases of several black residents who were attempting to integrate areas not zoned for blacks. William Floyd was a black shoemaker who purchased a home in a majority-white neighborhood. Floyd was jailed four times for attempting to occupy his newly purchased home. Dunjee bailed Floyd out each time and encouraged him to return to the home. In this period the US Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]'' (1917) that racially discriminatory state and local ordinances for housing were unconstitutional. A judge in Oklahoma ruled the state law was unconstitutional on those grounds.&lt;ref name=Lackmeyer&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lackmeyer|first1=Steve|title=Roscoe Dunjee: Fighter for Equality|url=http://www.okchistory.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=185:roscoe-dunjee-fighter-for-equality&amp;catid=41:people&amp;Itemid=78|website=OKC History|accessdate=7 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunjee was active in the NAACP, the Oklahoma Youth Legislature, the National Negro Democratic Association, and the Negro Business League.&lt;ref name=Rummel /&gt; He played a vital role in desegregating Oklahoma State University in 1948 (Rummel).

Dunjee never married,&lt;ref name=LaMotte&gt;{{cite web|last1=LaMotte|first1=Janet|title=Roscoe Dunjee|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/128172399|website=Find A Grave|accessdate=7 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor had any known children. Although he sold the newspaper in 1954 to another publisher, he worked there until his death in 1965.

==Legacy and honors==
*In 1969 he was inducted posthumously into the Oklahoma Journalist Hall of Fame at [[University of Central Oklahoma|Central State University]].&lt;ref name=Sheeler /&gt;

==Black Dispatch newspaper==
Roscoe Dunjee published Oklahoma City’s first black newspaper, the ''Black Dispatch'', from 1915 to 1954. Its name refers to "[[Black Dispatches]]", the term during the American Civil War for intelligence given to the Union by free or enslaved African Americans in the South.)

The ''Black Dispatch''&lt;ref name="Sullins, William S"/&gt; was a member of the Western Negro Press Association during its formative years. It later subscribed to the [[Associated Negro Press]], which boasted of having 112 member newspapers in 1921. Dunjee added the Crusader Service, the Pacific Coast News Bureau, and Preston News Service, among others. In the 21st century, the ''Black Dispatch'' continues to be operated, the oldest continuously published black newspaper in Oklahoma.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="985">'''Site-based conservation''' is an approach to [[nature conservation]] that relies on the designation of important or representative examples of sites supporting key habitats or species, such as [[Key Biodiversity Areas]] (KBAs) or [[Important Bird Area]]s (IBAs). Whilst a rational way of ensuring that the very best resources are protected, it is open to a number of criticisms:
* It tends to focus resources and protection on only the best sites.
* With a changing climate, the best sites now may not be the best ones to protect for the future.
* Wildlife is ignorant of lines drawn on maps by humans.
On balance, site-based conservation is an essential part of nature conservation, along with initiatives such as environmental subsidies and planning controls that protect biodiversity across the whole landscape (the broad and shallow approach), and the more holistic ideas of [[landscape-scale conservation]].

[[File:Skew-T.gif|300px|thumb|right|Black-and-white skew-T log-P diagram]]
[[File:Skew-T-color-blank.svg|300px|thumb|right|Color skew-T log-P diagram, with the temperature grid lines in red slanted to the right. Click for more details.]]

A '''skew-T log-P diagram''' is one of four [[thermodynamic diagrams]] commonly used in [[weather]] analysis and forecasting. In 1947, N. Herlofson proposed a modification to the [[emagram]] that allows straight, horizontal [[Contour line#Barometric pressure|isobars]] and provides for a large angle between [[Contour line#Temperature and related subjects|isotherms]] and dry [[adiabat]]s, similar to that in the [[tephigram]]. It was thus more suitable for some of the newer analysis techniques being invented by the [[United States Air Force]].

Such a diagram has pressure plotted on the vertical axis, with a [[logarithmic scale]] (thus the "log-P" part of the name), and the temperature plotted [[skew coordinates|skewed]], with isothermal lines at 45° to the plot (thus the "skew-T" part of the name). Plotting a hypothetical set of measurements with constant temperature for all altitudes would result in a line angled 45° to the right. In practice, since temperature usually drops with altitude, the graphs are usually mostly vertical (see examples linked to below).

The major use for skew-T log-P diagrams is the plotting of [[Atmospheric sounding|radiosonde soundings]], which give a vertical profile of the [[temperature]] and [[dew point]] temperature throughout the [[troposphere]] and lower [[stratosphere]]. The [[isopleth]]s on the diagram can then be used to simplify many tedious calculations involved, which were previously performed by hand or not at all. Many skew-T log-P diagrams also include a vertical representation of the wind speed and direction using wind barbs. Important atmospheric characteristics such as [[Dew point|saturation]], [[atmospheric instability]], and [[wind shear]] are critical in severe weather forecasting, by which skew-T log-P diagrams allow quick visual analysis. The diagrams are widely used by [[gliding|glider pilots]] to forecast the strength of [[thermal]]s and the height of the base of the associated cumulus clouds.

'''''Son et lumière''''' {{IPA-fr|sɔ̃n e lymjɛʁ}} (French, lit. "sound and light"), or a '''sound and light show''', is a form of nighttime entertainment that is usually presented in an outdoor venue of historic significance.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |title=son et lumière |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/554172/son-et-lumiere |accessdate=30 March 2010 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Special [[lighting]] effects are projected onto the façade of a building or [[ruin]] and synchronized with recorded or live [[narration]] and music to dramatize the history of the place.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;  The invention of the concept is credited to Paul Robert-Houdin, who was the [[curator]] of the [[Château de Chambord]] in France, which hosted the world's first ''son et lumière'' in 1952.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;  Another was established in the early 1960s at the site of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in Egypt.

This nighttime medium naturally lends itself to ecclesiastical buildings, stately homes and ruins,{{Citation needed|date=March 2010|reason=The unattributed claim that the nighttime "naturally lends itself..." gives the impression of being an original claim (see "Wikipedia:No original research") in the absence of a reference.}} and has rapidly become very popular in France where about 50 annual productions take place,&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt; principally in the [[Loire Valley]], at the [[Palace of Versailles]] and at [[Les Invalides]] in Paris.

The format usually involves no active participation by actors but a recorded narrative of the history of the building concerned by one or a cast of voices. To this is added music or [[sound effect]]s as appropriate, all of which is synchronised to lighting and/or projection effects which provide the visual dimension. [[Pyrotechnic]] effects are occasionally included for added spectacle.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;

A relatively recent variation is that, rather than the music and narration coming through a concert-like sound system, they may use [[Headset (audio)|headsets]], such as in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania's "Lights of Liberty". This allows an audience to move through a historic district as the show proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitphilly.com/history/philadelphia/lights-of-liberty/ Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corporation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102130036/http://www.visitphilly.com/history/philadelphia/lights-of-liberty/ |date=2011-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performances around the world==

In France, ''son et lumière'' shows are performed in and around France's historical [[château]]x. 

In neighboring [[Luxembourg]], a ''son et lumière'' event took place in 2007 at the Chateau de Septfontaines. 

In other countries, ''son et lumière'' has been mounted at the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] in Rome and at the [[Parthenon]] in Athens. 

In the United States, the first such presentation took place at [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]] in 1962. Another presentation took place at George Washington's [[Mount Vernon]] in May 1976 as France's bicentennial gift to the United States. The opening performance was attended by French President [[Giscard d'Estaing]] and American President [[Gerald Ford]].

Further afield, the first African production was at the [[Pyramids of Giza]] at [[Cairo]], Egypt, in 1961, while the first in Asia was the [[Red Fort]] in [[Delhi]], India in 1965 by the [[India Tourism Development Corporation]]. 

[[Canterbury Cathedral]] in England featured a ''son et lumière'' in 1965 and more recently in 2005, along with [[Rochester Cathedral]] and [[Rochester Castle|Castle]] as part of the European "Cathedrales en Lumière" project.

In Britain, where the majority of such productions have been staged at churches, [[cathedral]]s and [[abbey]]s, indoor presentations are frequently preferred, particularly as architectural gems might otherwise not be shown to best advantage.  The first British production was at [[Greenwich Palace]] in south London in 1957. In England in particular, where ''son et lumière'' is as well received as it is in France, many of the nations's principal historic houses and church buildings have enjoyed such a production.  Of particular interest have been the ones at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] (produced as part of the European "Cathedrales en Lumière" events), [[Rochester Castle]], [[St Augustine's Abbey]], [[St. George's Hall, Liverpool]], [[Tewkesbury Abbey]], [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Hampton Court Palace]], and at [[Chartwell]], the country home of [[Winston Churchill]]. Part of the [[London 2012 Olympic bid]] involved the use of ''son et lumière'' inspired light projections of [[sportsperson|athletes]] upon various London buildings. 

In [[India]], popular shows are at [[Red Fort]], [[Amer Fort]], [[Akbari Quila]], [[Ajmer]], [[Jantar Mantar, Jaipur]], [[Purana Qila, Delhi]], and [[Golconda Fort]]. In [[Peru]], a ''son et lumière'' show opened in [[Park of the Reserve]], Lima in 2007, called "Circuito Mágico del Agua" (''magic water circuit'') which has a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness record]] as the world's largest water source exposed in a public park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amarengo.org/articulos/circuito Circuito Mágico del Agua] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212205457/http://amarengo.org/articulos/circuito |date=2010-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Canada, the [[National Capital Commission]] has sponsored a sound and light show on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]] every year since 1984, from early July to mid-September.

In Australia, ''Blood Under the Southern Cross'', shown at [[Sovereign Hill]] in [[Ballarat]] since 1992, depicts the events of the 1854 [[Eureka Rebellion]].

In Israel, a son et lumière production is presented both at the [[Tower of David]] in the Citadel of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]], and at the desert butte of [[Masada]]. 

Composers who have produced son et lumière shows include [[Jacqueline Nova]] and [[Halim El-Dabh]]. French electronic music composer [[Jean Michel Jarre]] has incorporated son et lumière productions into his live concerts, which often take place outdoors at historical sites, sometimes with more than one million spectators.

'''Space tethers''' are long cables which can be used for propulsion, momentum exchange, stabilization and [[attitude control]], or maintaining the relative positions of the components of a large dispersed satellite/[[spacecraft]] sensor system.&lt;ref name= "handbook" /&gt; Depending on the mission objectives and altitude, [[spaceflight]] using this form of [[spacecraft propulsion]] is theorized to be significantly less expensive than spaceflight using [[rocket engine]]s.

==Main techniques==
Tether satellites might be used for various purposes, including research into [[Momentum exchange tether|tether propulsion]], [[Gravity-gradient stabilization|tidal stabilization]] and orbital plasma dynamics. Five main techniques for employing space tethers are in development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finckenor|first=Miria|author2=AIAA Technical Committee |title=Space Tether|journal=Aerospace America|date=December 2005|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bilen|first=Sven|author2=AIAA Technical Committee |title=Space Tethers|journal=Aerospace America|date=December 2007|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Electrodynamic tether]]s'''
:Electrodynamic tethers are primarily used for propulsion.  These are conducting tethers that carry a current that can generate either [[thrust]] or [[aerodynamic drag|drag]] from a [[planetary magnetic field]], in much the same way as an [[electric motor]] does.
'''[[Momentum exchange tether]]s'''
:These can be either rotating tethers, or [[Skyhook (structure)|non-rotating tethers]], that capture an arriving spacecraft and then release it at a later time into a different orbit with a different velocity.  Momentum exchange tethers can be used for [[orbital maneuver]]ing, or as part of a planetary-surface-to-orbit / orbit-to-escape-velocity space transportation system.
'''[[Tethered formation flying]]'''
:This is typically a [[insulator (electrical)|non-conductive]] tether that accurately maintains a set distance between multiple space vehicles flying in formation.
'''[[Electric Sail|Electric sail]]'''
:A form of [[solar wind]] sail with electrically charged [[tether]]s that will be pushed by the momentum of solar wind [[ion]]s.
'''[[Universal Orbital Support System]]'''
:A concept for suspending an object from a tether orbiting in space.

Many uses for space tethers have been proposed, including deployment as [[space elevator]]s, as [[Skyhook (structure)|skyhooks]], and for doing propellant-free orbital transfers.

== History ==

[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] once proposed a tower so tall that it reached into space, so that it would be held there by the rotation of the [[Earth]]. However, at the time, there was no realistic way to build it.

To try to solve the problems in ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' (July 31, 1960), another Russian, [[Yuri Artsutanov]], wrote in greater detail about the idea of a tensile cable to be deployed from a [[geosynchronous satellite]], downwards towards the ground, and upwards away, keeping the cable balanced. This is the [[space elevator]] idea, a type of synchronous tether that would rotate with the earth. However, given the materials technology of the time, this too was impractical on Earth.

In the 1970s, [[Jerome Pearson]] independently conceived the idea of a space elevator, sometimes referred to as a synchronous tether,&lt;ref name="Pearson 2005"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/1032Pearson.pdf| last=Pearson| date=2005| title=Lunar Space Elevators for Cislunar Space Development: Phase I Final Technical Report| first=Jerome| author2=Eugene Levin| author3=John Oldson| author4=Harry Wykes| last-author-amp=yes| format=PDF| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194808/http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/1032Pearson.pdf| archivedate=2016-03-03| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in particular, analyzed a [[lunar elevator]] that can go through the [[Lagrange point|L1 and L2 points]], and this was found to be possible with materials then existing.

In 1977, [[Hans Moravec]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/1976.skyhook/papers/scable.pox|title=The Journal of the Astronautical Sciences, v25#4, pp. 307-322, Oct-Dec 1977|author=|date=|website=cmu.edu|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003034448/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/1976.skyhook/papers/scable.pox|archivedate=3 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Robert L. Forward]] investigated the physics of non-synchronous [[Skyhook (structure)|skyhooks]], also known as rotating skyhooks, and performed detailed simulations of tapered rotating tethers that could pick objects off, and place objects onto, the [[Moon]], [[Mars]] and other [[planets]], with little loss, or even a net gain of energy.&lt;ref name="nonsynch"&gt;{{Cite web |first=Hans |last=Moravec |url=http://www.mxertether.com/papers/architectures/nonsynch-skyhook-materials.pdf |title=Orbital Bridges |date=1986 |accessdate=Oct 10, 2010}}{{dead link |date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moravec87"&gt;Hans Moravec, [http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1987/skyhook.ltx "Non-Synchronous Orbital Skyhooks for the Moon and Mars with Conventional Materials"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.li/19991012232419/http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1987/skyhook.ltx |date=1999-10-12 }} (Hans Moravec's thoughts on skyhooks, tethers, rotovators, etc., as of 1987) (accessed 10 October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Missions ===

[[Image:TiPS lg.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Graphic of the US Naval Research Laboratory's TiPS tether satellite. Only a small part of the 4&amp;nbsp;km tether is shown deployed.]]

{{main article|Space tether missions}}

A '''tether satellite''' is a [[satellite]] connected to another by a space tether. A number of satellites have been launched to test tether technologies, with varying degrees of success.

==Types==

There are many different (and overlapping) types of tether.

===Momentum exchange tethers, rotating===
{{main article|Momentum exchange tether}}

[[Momentum]] Exchange Tethers are one of many applications for space tethers.  Momentum Exchange Tethers come in two types; rotating and non-rotating.  A rotating tether will create a controlled force on the end-masses of the system due to centrifugal acceleration.  While the tether system rotates, the objects on either end of the tether will experience continuous acceleration; the magnitude of the acceleration depends on the length of the tether and the rotation rate. Momentum exchange occurs when an end body is released during the rotation.  The transfer of momentum to the released object will cause the rotating tether to lose energy, and thus lose velocity and altitude.  However, using [[electrodynamic tether]] thrusting, or [[ion propulsion]] the system can then re-boost itself with little or no expenditure of consumable reaction mass.

===Skyhook===
{{main article|Skyhook (structure)}}
[[File:Skyhooks.gif|thumb|right|A rotating and a tidally stabilised skyhook in orbit]]
A skyhook is a theoretical class of orbiting [[tether propulsion]] intended to lift payloads to high altitudes and speeds.&lt;ref&gt;H. Moravec, "A non-synchronous orbital skyhook".

===Electrodynamics===
[[Image:STS-75 Tethered Satellite System deployment.jpg|thumb|right|Medium close-up view, captured with a 70&amp;nbsp;mm camera, shows [[Tethered Satellite System]] deployment.]]
{{main article|Electrodynamic tether}}
'''Electrodynamic tethers''' are long conducting wires, such as one deployed from a [[tether satellite]], which can operate on electromagnetic principles as [[electrical generator|generators]], by converting their [[kinetic energy]] to [[electrical energy]], or as [[electric motor|motors]], converting electrical energy to kinetic energy.&lt;ref name= "handbook" /&gt; Electric potential is generated across a conductive tether by its motion through the earth's magnetic field. The choice of the metal [[electrical conductor|conductor]] to be used in an electrodynamic tether is determined by a variety of factors. Primary factors usually include high [[electrical conductivity]] and low [[density]]. Secondary factors, depending on the application, include cost, strength, and melting point.

An electrodynamic tether was profiled in the documentary film ''[[Orphans of Apollo]]'' as technology that was to be used to keep the Russian space station ''[[Mir]]'' in orbit.&lt;ref name="Orphans of Apollo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Orphans of Apollo|url=http://orphansofapollo.wordpress.com/|publisher=World Press|accessdate=30 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621125917/http://orphansofapollo.wordpress.com/|archivedate=21 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Foust&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foust|first=Jeff|title=Preview: Orphans of Apollo|journal=The Space Review|date=July 23, 2001|url=http://thespacereview.com/article/1176/1|accessdate=30 January 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205193306/http://thespacereview.com/article/1176/1|archivedate=5 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation flying===
{{main article|Tethered formation flying}}

This is the use of a (typically) non-conductive tether to connect multiple spacecraft. A proposed 2011 experiment to study the technique is the [[tempo3|Tethered Experiment for Mars inter-Planetary Operations (TEMPO³)]].

===Universal Orbital Support System===
{{main article|Universal Orbital Support System}}
[[File:Universal Orbital Support System.png|thumb|Example of a possible layout using the Universal Orbital Support System.]]
A theoretical type of non-rotating tethered satellite system, it is a concept for providing space-based support to things suspended above an astronomical object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2017/0329/A-20-mile-long-spacescraper-dangling-from-an-asteroid-Could-it-work|title=A 20-mile long 'spacescraper' dangling from an asteroid: Could it work?|last=Wood|first=Charlie|date=29 March 2017|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331170132/https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2017/0329/A-20-mile-long-spacescraper-dangling-from-an-asteroid-Could-it-work|archivedate=31 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orbital system is a coupled mass system wherein the upper supporting mass (A) is placed in an orbit around a given celestial body such that it can support a suspended mass (B) at a specific height above the surface of the celestial body, but lower than (A).

==Technical difficulties==

===Gravitational gradient stabilization===

[[File:Fig11 Gravitational Gradient.PNG|thumb|right|Description of the forces contributing towards maintaining a gravity gradient alignment in a tether system]]

{{main article|Gravity-gradient stabilization}}

Instead of rotating end for end, tethers can also be kept straight by the slight difference in the strength of gravity over their length.

A non-rotating tether system has a stable orientation that is aligned along the local vertical (of the earth or other body). This can be understood by inspection of the figure below where two spacecraft at two different altitudes have been connected by a tether. Normally, each spacecraft would have a balance of gravitational (e.g. F&lt;sub&gt;g1&lt;/sub&gt;) and centrifugal (e.g. F&lt;sub&gt;c1&lt;/sub&gt;), but when tied together by a tether, these values begin to change with respect to one another. This phenomenon occurs because, without the tether, the higher-altitude mass would travel slower than the lower mass. The system must move at a single speed, so the tether must therefore slow down the lower mass and speed up the upper one.  The centrifugal force of the tethered upper body is increased, while that of the lower-altitude body is reduced. This results in the centrifugal force of the upper body and the gravitational force of the lower body being dominant.  This difference in forces naturally aligns the system along the local vertical, as seen in the figure.&lt;ref name=ref18&gt;Cosmo, M. L., Lorenzini, E. C., "Tethers in Space Handbook", NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, 1997, pp. 274-1-274 {{clarify|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atomic oxygen===
{{details|Atomic oxygen}}
Objects in low Earth orbit are subjected to noticeable erosion from atomic oxygen due to the high [[orbital speed]] with which the molecules strike as well as their high reactivity. This could quickly erode a tether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=539QDxp-rtQC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=space+tether+atomic+oxygen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=T-u1bwY-WT&amp;sig=mT5zDCbORbM-5CBNgAyEnnZEVgg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibvsig94jNAhUELhoKHS5QAAkQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=space%20tether%20atomic%20oxygen&amp;f=false|title=Space Tethers and Space Elevators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Micrometeorites and space junk===

Simple single-strand tethers are susceptible to [[meteoroid|micrometeoroids]] and [[space debris|space junk]]. Several systems have since been proposed and tested to improve debris resistance:
* The US [[US Naval Research Laboratory|Naval Research Laboratory]] has successfully flown a long term 6&amp;nbsp;km long, 2-3mm diameter tether with an outer layer of Spectra 1000 braid and a core of acrylic yarn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellite_missions/list_of_satellites/tipn_general.html |title=TiPS: Missuion Objectives |accessdate=2011-10-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708055545/http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellite_missions/list_of_satellites/tipn_general.html |archivedate=July 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This satellite, the Tether Physics and Survivability Experiment (TiPS), was launched in June 1996 and remained in operation over 10 years, finally breaking in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satobs.org/noss.html NOSS Launch Data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928140415/http://www.satobs.org/noss.html |date=2011-09-28 }} (see NOSS 2-3, which deployed TiPS)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Robert P. Hoyt|Dr. Robert P. Hoyt]] patented an engineered circular net, such that a cut strand's strains would be redistributed automatically around the severed strand. This is called a [[Hoytether]].  Hoytethers have theoretical lifetimes of decades.
* Researchers with [[JAXA]] have also proposed net-based tethers for their future missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Large pieces of junk would still cut most tethers, including the improved versions listed here, but these are currently tracked on radar and have predictable orbits. A tether could be wiggled to dodge known pieces of junk, or thrusters used to change the orbit, avoiding a collision.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

== Construction ==

===Properties of useful materials===

[[Image:TSS-1R tether composition.png|thumb|right|alt=TSS-1R.|TSS-1R tether composition [NASA].]]

Tether properties and materials are dependent on the application. However, there are some common properties. To achieve maximum performance and low cost, tethers would need to be made of materials with the combination of high strength or electrical conductivity and low density. All space tethers are susceptible to space debris or micrometeroids. Therefore, system designers will need to decide whether or not a protective coating is needed, including relative to [[Ultraviolet|UV]] and [[atomic oxygen]]. Research is being conducted to assess the probability of a collision that would damage the tether [http://pdf.aiaa.org/getfile.cfm?urlX=4%3A7I%276D%26XY%22O%2CRA7KW4%5B%5DV%3A%5B%3D5%3A%28%20%0A&amp;urla=%25%2ARH%23%23P8%20%0A&amp;urlb=%21%2A%20%20%20%0A&amp;urlc=%21%2A0%20%20%0A&amp;urld=%28%2A%22%40%20%23%20%2AJUA%5C%20%0A&amp;urle=%27%28%22X%20%22%20%22%40T0%20%20%0A MAST].

For applications that exert high tensile forces on the tether, the materials need to be strong and light. Some current tether designs use crystalline plastics such as [[ultra high molecular weight polyethylene]], [[aramid]] or carbon fiber. A possible future material would be [[carbon nanotube]]s, which have an estimated [[tensile strength]] between 140 and 177 [[Orders of magnitude (pressure)|GPa]] (20.3-25.6 million psi), and a proven tensile strength in the range 50-60 GPa for some individual nanotubes. (A [[monocrystalline whisker|number of other materials obtain 10 to 20 GPa]] in some samples on the nano scale, but translating such strengths to the macro scale has been challenging so far, with, as of 2011, CNT-based ropes being an order of magnitude less strong, not yet stronger than more conventional carbon fiber on that scale).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science-wired.blogspot.com/2010/04/nanotube-fibers.html|title=Nanotube Fibers|author=|date=|website=science-wired.blogspot.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201233204/http://science-wired.blogspot.com/2010/04/nanotube-fibers.html|archivedate=1 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v74/i21/p3152_s1?isAuthorized=no Tensile tests of ropes of very long aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722130146/http://apl.aip.org/resource/1/applab/v74/i21/p3152_s1?isAuthorized=no |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121219010021/https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mfyu/www/Documents/Publications/PRL1-2000.pdf Tensile Loading of Ropes of Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes and their Mechanical Properties]&lt;/ref&gt;

For some applications, the tensile force on the tether is projected to be less than 15&amp;nbsp;lbs (&lt; 65 N)&lt;ref name= "TSS-1R Failure Investigation"&gt;NASA, [http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19970011947 TSS-1R Mission Failure Investigation Board], Final Report, May 31, 1996 (accessed 7 April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Material selection in this case depends on the purpose of the mission and design constraints. Electrodynamic tethers, such as the one used on TSS-1R,{{clarify|date=March 2018}} may use thin copper wires for high conductivity (see [[Electrodynamic tether|EDT]]).

There are design equations for certain applications that may be used to aid designers in identifying typical quantities that drive material selection.

Space elevator equations typically use a "characteristic length", L&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, which is also known as its "self-support length" and is the length of untapered cable it can support in a constant 1 ''g'' gravity field.
:&lt;math&gt;L_c = \frac{\sigma}{\rho g}&lt;/math&gt;,
where σ is the stress limit (in pressure units) and ρ is the density of the material.

Hypersonic skyhook equations use the material's "specific velocity" which is equal to the maximum tangential velocity a spinning hoop can attain without breaking:
:&lt;math&gt;V = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma}{\rho}}&lt;/math&gt;

For rotating tethers (rotovators) the value used is the material’s ‘characteristic velocity’ which is the maximum tip velocity a rotating untapered cable can attain without breaking,
:&lt;math&gt;V_c = \sqrt{\frac{2\sigma}{\rho}}&lt;/math&gt;
The characteristic velocity equals the specific velocity multiplied by the square root of two.

These values are used in equations similar to the [[rocket equation]] and are analogous to specific impulse or exhaust velocity. The higher these values are, the more efficient and lighter the tether can be in relation to the payloads that they can carry. Eventually however, the mass of the tether propulsion system will be limited at the low end by other factors such as momentum storage.

===Practical materials===

===Shape===

====Tapering====

For gravity stabilised tethers, to exceed the self-support length the tether material can be tapered so that the cross-sectional area varies with the total load at each point along the length of the cable. In practice this means that the central tether structure needs to be thicker than the tips. Correct tapering ensures that the tensile stress at every point in the cable is exactly the same. For very demanding applications, such as an Earth space elevator, the tapering can reduce the excessive ratios of cable weight to payload weight.

====Thickness====

For rotating tethers not significantly affected by gravity, the thickness also varies, and it can be shown that the area, A, is given as a function of r (the distance from the centre) as follows:&lt;ref name=lunarforward&gt;[http://www.tethers.com/papers/LEO2Lunar%2792.pdf "Tether Transport from LEO to the Lunar Surface", R. L. Forward, AIAA Paper 91-2322, 27th Joint Propulsion Conference, 1991] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517191711/http://www.tethers.com/papers/LEO2Lunar'92.pdf |date=2011-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A(r) = \frac {M v^2} {T R} \mathrm{e} ^ { \frac {\delta} {T} \frac {v^2} {2} \left( 1-\frac {r^2} {R^2} \right) } &lt;/math&gt;
where R is the radius of tether, v is the velocity with respect to the centre, M is the tip mass, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the material density, and T is the design tensile strength ([[Young's modulus]] divided by safety factor).

====Mass ratio====

[[File:Spinning tethers.png|thumb|right|Graph of tether mass to payload ratio versus the tip speed in multiples of the characteristic speed of the material]]

Integrating the area to give the volume and multiplying by the density and dividing by the payload mass gives a payload mass / tether mass ratio of:&lt;ref name=lunarforward/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac M m = \sqrt { \pi \frac { \delta } T \frac {V^2} {2} } \mathrm{e}^{ \left( \frac { \delta } T \frac {V^2} {2} \right) } \mathrm{erf} \left( \sqrt { \frac { \delta } T \frac { V^2 } {2} } \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where erf is the normal probability [[error function]].

Let &lt;math&gt;V_r = V / V_c \,&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;V_c = \sqrt { \frac {2 T} \delta }&lt;/math&gt;
then:&lt;ref&gt;Non-Synchronous Orbital Skyhooks for the Moon and Mars with Conventional Materials - [[Hans Moravec]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac M m = \sqrt { \pi } V_r \mathrm{e}^{ {V_r}^2 } \mathrm{erf} ( {V_r} ) &lt;/math&gt;
This equation can be compared with the [[rocket equation]], which is proportional to a simple exponent on a velocity, rather than a velocity squared. This difference effectively limits the delta-v that can be obtained from a single tether.

===Redundancy===

In addition the cable shape must be constructed to withstand micrometeorites and [[space debris|space junk]]. This can be achieved with the use of redundant cables, such as the [[Hoytether]]; redundancy can ensure that it is very unlikely that multiple redundant cables would be damaged near the same point on the cable, and hence a very large amount of total damage can occur over different parts of the cable before failure occurs.

===Material strength===

Beanstalks and rotovators are currently limited by the strengths of available materials.  Although ultra-high strength plastic fibers ([[Kevlar]] and [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene#Fiber applications|Spectra]]) permit rotovators to pluck masses from the surface of the Moon and Mars, a rotovator from these materials cannot lift from the surface of the Earth. In theory, high flying, [[supersonic]] (or [[hypersonic]]) aircraft could deliver a payload to a rotovator that dipped into Earth's upper atmosphere briefly at predictable locations throughout the tropic (and temperate) zone of Earth. As of May 2013, all mechanical tethers (orbital and elevators) are on hold until stronger materials are available.&lt;ref name="on hold"&gt;Jillian Scharr, "Space Elevators On Hold At Least Until Stronger Materials Are Available, Experts Say", Huffington Post, May 29, 2013 {{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/space-elevators-stronger-materials_n_3353697.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302234815/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/space-elevators-stronger-materials_n_3353697.html |archivedate=2014-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cargo capture===

Cargo capture for rotovators is nontrivial, and failure to capture can cause problems. Several systems have been proposed, such as shooting nets at the cargo, but all add weight, complexity, and another failure mode. At least one lab scale demonstration of a working grapple system has been achieved however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2005/05-108.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126035813/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2005/05-108.html |archivedate=2010-11-26 |df= }} NASA Engineers, Tennessee College Students Successfully Demonstrate Catch Mechanism for Future Space Tether&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life expectancy===

Currently, the strongest materials in tension are plastics that require a coating for protection from UV radiation and (depending on the orbit) erosion by atomic oxygen. Disposal of [[waste heat]] is difficult in a [[vacuum]], so [[thermal shock|overheating]] may cause tether failures or damage.

==Control and modelling==

===Pendular motion instability===

Electrodynamic tethers deployed along the local vertical ('hanging tethers') may suffer from dynamical instability. Pendular motion causes the tether vibration amplitude to build up under the action of electromagnetic interaction. As the mission time increases, this behavior can compromise the performance of the system. Over a few weeks, electrodynamic tethers in Earth orbit might build up vibrations in many modes, as their orbit interacts with irregularities in magnetic and gravitational fields.

One plan to control the vibrations is to actively vary the tether current to counteract the growth of the vibrations. Electrodynamic tethers can be stabilized by reducing their current when it would feed the oscillations, and increasing it when it opposes oscillations.  Simulations have demonstrated that this can control tether vibration.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} This approach requires sensors to measure tether vibrations, which can either be an [[inertial navigation system]] on one end of the tether, or [[satellite navigation]] systems mounted on the tether, transmitting their positions to a receiver on the end.

Another proposed method is to use spinning electrodynamic tethers instead of hanging tethers. The gyroscopic effect provides passive stabilisation, avoiding the instability.

===Surges===
As mentioned earlier, conductive tethers have failed from unexpected current surges. Unexpected [[electrostatic discharge]]s have cut tethers (e.g. see Tethered Satellite System Reflight (TSS‑1R) on [[STS-75|STS‑75]]), damaged electronics, and welded tether handling machinery. It may be that the Earth's magnetic field is not as homogeneous as some engineers have believed.

===Vibrations===

Computer models frequently show tethers can snap due to vibration.

Mechanical tether-handling equipment is often surprisingly heavy, with complex controls to damp vibrations.  The one ton climber proposed by Dr. Brad Edwards for his Space Elevator may detect and suppress most vibrations by changing speed and direction. The climber can also repair or augment a tether by spinning more strands.

The vibration modes that may be a problem include skipping rope, transverse, longitudinal, and pendulum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/tether/dynamics.html Tether dynamics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717015440/http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/academy/TETHER/Dynamics.html |date=2007-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tethers are nearly always tapered, and this can greatly amplify the movement at the thinnest tip in whip-like ways.

===Other issues===

A tether is not a spherical object, and has significant extent. This means that as an extended object, it is not directly modelable as a point source, and this means that the [[center of mass]] and [[center of gravity]] are not usually colocated. Thus the inverse square law does not apply except at large distances, to the overall behaviour of a tether. Hence the orbits are not completely Keplerian, and in some cases they are actually chaotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/3453325/Ultra_Long_Orbital_Tethers_Behave_Highly_Non-Keplerian_and_Unstable |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004124204/http://www.academia.edu/3453325/Ultra_Long_Orbital_Tethers_Behave_Highly_Non-Keplerian_and_Unstable |archivedate=2017-10-04 |df= }} Ultra Long Orbital WSEAS TRANSACTIONS on MATHEMATICS: Tethers Behave Highly Non-Keplerian and Unstable- Daniele Mortari&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Non-rocket spacelaunch#Bolo|bolus]] designs, rotation of the cable interacting with the non linear gravity fields found in elliptical orbits can cause exchange of orbital angular momentum and rotation angular momentum. This can make prediction and modelling extremely complex.

'''Strikes! Labor History Encyclopedia of the Pacific Northwest''' is a clearinghouse of information on the labor history of the region developed by the [[University of Washington]] and Professor James N. Gregory as part of the [[Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights History Projects]]. The Encyclopedia covers the major industries of [[Washington (state)|Washington State]], major unions and worker struggles, civil rights activism among many ethnic communities, radical organizations, the [[Great Depression]] and the [[New Deal]] and the region's rich history of labor and radical newspapers.

==Content==
The site is organized into thematic categories, focusing on the core industries and movements that have shaped the social history of the region. These include the timber, waterfront, aerospace, construction, farm  industries. Outside of unions and strikes, other aspects of workers and their struggles are examined, from everyday life in the Great Depression to labor culture and art. A particular focus is also given to the intertwined history of radical organizations with labor struggles, including the Industrial Workers of the World, the Communist Party and the United Construction Workers Association. Civil rights organizations and the struggles of black, Asian-American, women, and Latino workers for jobs, housing and equal rights is also cataloged. Much of the content is housed by the individual projects of the [[Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights History Projects|Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights History]] initiative, which has gathered thousands of oral histories, rare photos, vintage newspapers and original academic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dublin|first=Thomas|title=The New Labor History, the New Media, and New Challenges|journal=Labor: Studies in Working-Class History of the Americas|date=Summer 2010|volume=7|issue=2|pages=83–96 |url=http://depts.washington.edu/labhist/labor_review.pdf|doi=10.1215/15476715-2009-078}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=James|author2=Trevor Griffey |title=Teaching a City about Its Civil Rights History: A Public History Success Story|journal=Perspectives|date=April 2007|volume=45|issue=4|url=http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2007/0704/index.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''torture chamber''' is a room where [[torture]] is inflicted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Torture%20chamber Torture chamber.

Wordnetweb.princeton.edu. Retrieved on 2011-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval torture chamber was windowless and often built underground, was lit by a few candles and was specifically designed to induce "horror, dread and despair" to anyone but those possessing a strong mind and "nerves of steel".&lt;ref name="Ryley Scott"/&gt;

Historically, torture chambers were located in royal palaces, in castles of the nobility and even buildings belonging to the church. They featured secret trap-doors which could be activated to throw victims into dark [[dungeon]]s where they remained and eventually died. The skeletal remains of people who disappeared were strewn on the floor of the hidden dungeons. Other times the dungeons under the trap-doors included pits of water where the victim was thrown to drown after a lengthy torture session in the chamber above.&lt;ref name="Alger1889"/&gt;

In Peru, the torture chambers of the [[Inquisition]] were specifically constructed with thick walls so that the screams of the victims could not penetrate them and no sound could be heard from the outside. Other more sophisticated designs used principles of [[acoustics]] to muffle the screams of the tortured and included walls which recessed and protruded  in such a fashion as to reflect the screams of the victims so that the sounds would not be carried to the exterior.

The mere presence of the torture chamber was used as a form of intimidation and coercion. The victims were first shown the chamber and if they confessed they would not be tortured inside it. Other times the torture chamber was used as the final destination in a series of prison cells where the victims would gradually be moved from one type of cell to another, under progressively worsening conditions of incarceration, and if they did not recant in the earlier stages they would finally reach the torture chamber. The final stage of actually going to the torture chamber itself, just prior to the initiation of torture, was euphemistically called the "Question".&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Tower of London, Traitors Gate.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Tower of London and Traitors Gate. In the [[Middle ages]], torture was carried out in its chambers]]
Throughout history torture chambers have been used in a multiplicity of ways starting from [[Torture#Torture in the past|Roman]] times. Torture chamber use during the Middle Ages was frequent. Religious, social and political persecution led to the widespread use of torture during that time. Torture chambers were also used during the [[Spanish Inquisition]] and at the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref name="Spanish"&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/torquemada/index.html Torquemada and the Spanish Inquisition:Chapter 3.

Another example of a torture chamber, not known by many, is "The Thieves Tower" in the [[Alsace, France|Alsace]] region of France. Once a tower used for torture, it is now a small museum displaying instruments used upon the prisoners to get them to confess crimes.&lt;ref name="alsace-route-des-vins.com"&gt;[http://www.oconus.com/Main/eArticle.asp?205 Overseas Military Portal website.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104181353/http://www.oconus.com/Main/eArticle.asp?205 |date=4 November 2006 }} quote:''The Thieves Tower wasn’t a hideout for medieval criminals, but a place where they would pay for their crimes.

In [[Venice]], the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Palazzo Ducale]] had its own torture chamber, which was deemed to be of such importance that renovations started in 1507 so that the chamber walls could be kept strong and secure: "''considerata la grandissima importantia de j cameroti di la Camera del tormento che siano forti e securi''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard John Goy|title=Building Renaissance Venice: patrons, architects and builders, c. 1430–1500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCUkqUZOTc8C&amp;pg=PA231|accessdate=30 August 2011|year=2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-11292-4|pages=231–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ashoka's Hell===
{{main article|Ashoka's Hell}}
According to the narrations of [[Ashokavadana]], King [[Ashoka]], prior to his conversion to Buddhism, was a fierce and sadistic ruler, known as ''Ashoka the Fierce'', who built a palatial torture chamber known as ''Ashoka's Hell''. The legend of the torture palace is detailed in the writings of the Ashokavadana.

According to Ashokavadana, Ashoka asked Girika, who was the official executioner of his kingdom, to design an elaborate torture chamber disguised as a beautiful and "enticing" palace adorned with all kinds of decorations and full of amenities such as exclusive baths decorated with flowers,  fruit trees and many ornaments. It was artfully designed to make people long to just look at it.&lt;ref name="A History Of Ancient India"/&gt;

According to legend, beneath the veneer of beauty deep inside the  exclusive mansion, torture chambers were constructed  which were full of the most sadistic and cruel instruments of torture including furnaces producing molten metal.&lt;ref name="SaranMishi2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mishi Saran|author2=Mishi|title=Chasing the Monk's Shadow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hkOBNbnOGYC&amp;pg=PA274|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=1 July 2012|publisher=Penguin Books India|isbn=978-0-14-306439-8|page=274|quote=By Xuanzang's account, King Ashoka was at first a horrid man. He had custom-built torture chambers that he enclosed in high walls. There were furnaces of molten metal, ugly sharp instruments. Every criminal in the land was consigned to this compound, all who crossed its threshold had to die.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the accounts contained in the Ashokavadana, Girika, the architect of the chamber, was inspired by descriptions of the five tortures of the [[Buddhist hell]] for the design of the torture chamber and of the torture methods he inflicted upon his victims.&lt;ref name="Scharfstein1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben-Ami Scharfstein|title=Amoral Politics: The Persistent Truth of Machiavellism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ibkxwtmP7_UC&amp;pg=PA61|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-1886-5|pages=61–62|quote=The executioner persuades Ashoka to build a prison in which the tortures imitate those suffered in Buddhist hell [...] In response the executioner wants to kill Ashoka-on the grounds that the king has promised that no one who has entered the prison will leave it alive-...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Obeyesekere2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gananath Obeyesekere|title=Imagining Karma: Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yllblMkRgMMC&amp;pg=PA172|accessdate=18 April 2013|year=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-23243-3|pages=172–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The torture chamber was so terrifying, that King Ashoka himself was thought to have visited [[hell]] so that he could perfect its evil design.&lt;ref name="Vittachi2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nury Vittachi|title=The Kama Sutra of Business: Management Principles from Indian Classics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xK5CBu0UBygC&amp;pg=PT162|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=13 April 2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-82223-4|page=162|quote=He apparently built a torture chamber that was so horrible that people said he had descended to Hell itself to pick up design ideas.

The process of being tied and led to the torture rack inside the torture chamber was a form of intimidation and was called ''territio realis'' as opposed to ''territio verbalis oder lexis'' which was the verbal threat of torture being made at the judgment hall. ''Territio realis'' as well as the actual torture session were called ''examen rigorosum''.&lt;ref name=Review&gt;{{cite book|title=The Contemporary Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AosFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA688|year=1880|publisher=A.

In the book ''Crime and criminal justice in Europe and Canada'' it is mentioned that fear was a factor in the process of torture and that there was a form of torture known as ''La présentation de la question'' or simply the "Question",&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt; where the prisoner was led to the torture chamber and was shown the implements of torture. While at the chamber, sentence to full torture was pronounced but, immediately after, the prisoner was taken back to the prison cell, without actually having been tortured.&lt;ref name="Criminal Justice"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Hamilton Baker|author2=Louis A.

Press|isbn=978-0-88920-118-7|pages=59–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The torture chamber was specifically designed to evoke fear in the victims.&lt;ref name="History of Torture Throughout the Ages"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Ryley Scott|title=History of Torture Throughout the Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tj7vbMmuvhYC&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=30 August 2011|date=10 March 2003|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-7661-4063-9|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was usually built underground and only dimly lit. Inside the chamber waited the executioner, his face completely covered apart from two holes in the garment to enable him to peer through and wearing a black hood; his menacing appearance being described as "most diabolical" and "satanic".&lt;ref name="History of Torture Throughout the Ages"/&gt;

When during the Question, the view of the chamber, the torture implements and the executioner did not cause the victim to confess, a full-scale torture session was planned. To prepare for torture, the victim was stripped naked with hands tied. The penultimate step to torture included a repetition of the questions asked earlier of the victims. If the victims still proclaimed their innocence, full torture was initiated.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History of Torture Throughout the Ages"/&gt;

The most common instrument of torture was the ''[[strappado]]'',&lt;ref name="Inquisition from Its Establishment"/&gt; which was a simple rope and [[pulley]] system. With the pulley attached to ceiling of the chamber, the lifting rope was tied to the wrist of the victim, whose hands were tied behind their back. Subsequently, the victim was raised to the ceiling and then lowered using a jerking motion causing dislocation of the [[shoulder joint]]s. To increase the suffering caused by the strappado, weights were attached to the feet of the victim.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Inquisition from Its Establishment"/&gt;

Church doctrine protected human life so it was problematic if a victim were to die, especially before they confessed. In difficult cases, when a victim would not readily confess or was too weak to continue in an uninterrupted torture session, breaks were allowed between torture sessions because Inquisition regulations only allowed one torture session per victim. That way, a torture session could resume after a break to allow time for the victim to recover or reconsider their opposition to confessing, and it was considered to have been the continuation of the previous torture session and not a new one.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt;

Because confession under torture was not acceptable, the victim had to sign a written confession after they had made their oral confession under torture. Typically, during confession, the inquisitors demanded that the prisoner  implicate as many people as possible and not only themselves. If the prisoner resisted signing, the inquisitors could always resume the torture by claiming that they had just halted the session, just for the signing, but did not really put an end to it.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt;

The method of construction of the torture chamber of the [[Palais des Papes|papal palace]] at [[Avignon]], used during the Inquisition, has been described as ingenious.&lt;ref name="Heckethorn2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles William Heckethorn|title=The Secret Societies of All Ages &amp; Countries - Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yr-8FypJ7ekC&amp;pg=PA179|date=November 2005|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=978-1-59605-436-3|volume=1|pages=179–|quote=The next move of the prisoner was to the torture chamber. The torture chamber in the papal palace at Avignon was constructed with diabolical ingenuity. To cause the shrieks and groans of those tortured to remain confined within the hall, each wall projects and recedes in such a manner as to exhibit a face in a different direction to that of the wall on the opposite side, and in this way the solid mass of masonry of each wall is carried upwards, the result of which peculiar structure is that shrieks were thrown back from wall to wall, and thus never could reach the outside, nor disturb the pope, toying with his concubines in the adjoining palace.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of some of the torture chambers at Avignon was based on principles of [[Acoustics]], specifically designed to muffle the screams and cries of the tortured.&lt;ref name="Crétineau-Joly1863"/&gt; The walls of the torture chamber recessed and protruded in a complementary fashion to the walls on the opposite side so as to reflect the screams of the victims locally, ensuring that their shrieks would not be carried to the exterior.&lt;ref name="Heckethorn2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crétineau-Joly1863"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jacques Crétineau-Joly|Jacques Augustin M.

There were secret staircases and hidden spaces which were used to overhear the discussions in the prison cells.

In [[Nuremberg]] and [[Salzburg]] the torture chambers featured [[trapdoors]] on their floors.

The torture chamber was the final destination in a progression of four cell types during incarceration at the Palace of the Inquisition. The palace contained the Judgement Hall, the offices of the employees, the private apartments of the [[Grand Inquisitor]] and the detention cells adjacent to the apartments.&lt;ref name="Heckethorn2005"/&gt; The detention cell gradations started with the ''cells of mercy'' reserved mainly for rich transgressors who upon bequeathing all their property to the Inquisition were normally let go after a time of detention in the cells.

For more difficult prisoners the next cell stage was the ''cell of penitence''. These were situated in small round towers of about 3 metres (ten feet) in diameter. They were painted white and included rudimentary furniture such as a stool and a bed. Very little light was allowed in. If the prisoner did not cooperate, the next step in the detention process was the [[dungeon]]. The dungeon had walls 1.5 metres (five feet) thick, double doors and was in complete darkness. No conversation of any type was allowed in the dungeon.&lt;ref name="P and R"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heckethorn2005"/&gt; The food allowance for prisoners was less than a penny a day including the profit of the warden while any human refuse was removed every four days.  After a stay in the dungeon, uncooperative prisoners were moved to their final destination: the torture chamber.&lt;ref name="Heckethorn2005"/&gt;

=== In art, entertainment, and media===

====Film====
In film the torture chamber is also known as the '''chamber of horrors''', with the word ''horror'' implying ''torture'' as well as ''[[murder]]'', or a combination of both. Classic films focusing on the torture chamber include:
*''[[The Pit and the Pendulum (1961 film)|The Pit and the Pendulum]]'' (1961).
*''[[Chamber of Horrors (1966 film)|Chamber of Horrors]]'' (1966).
* ''[[The Pendulum, the Pit and Hope]]'' (1983). Directed by [[Jan Švankmajer]]
*''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' (2005)
* ''The Cell Zero'' ({{when|date=June 2016}}), a film about the [[Greek Military Police]] torture chambers{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
*''[[The Blood Demon|The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism]]'' (1967; Die Schlangengrube und das Pendel). A German adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's novel "The Pit and the Pendulum".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvddrive-in.com/reviews/t-z/torturechamberdeathsmiles6773.htm The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism (1967)]. Dvddrive-in.com. Retrieved on 2011-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Literature====
*There is a torture chamber In [[George Orwell]]'s famous novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949), [[Room 101]].
*In [[Gaston Leroux]]'s novel ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (serialised in ''[[Le Gaulois]]'' from September 23, 1909, to January 8, 1910), [[Erik_(The_Phantom_of_the_Opera)|Erik]] (the Phantom's) chamber of torture consisted of a hexagonal room lined with [[mirror]]s on each wall.  Temperatures vary inside the room, and soon, without food or water, people trapped in there begin having [[hallucination]]s.  There is an iron tree in there with a [[lasso]] under it with which one can commit [[suicide]], which is the only way out.
*Harold T. Wilkins' article in the September 1929 issue of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', titled "Secrets of Ancient Torture Chambers", describes the [fictitious] shrinking torture chamber at the Tolfi castle in [[Sicily]]  as an example of an ancient torture chamber and proposes a mechanical model to account for the contracting action of the chamber.&lt;ref name="Shrinking chamber"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xt4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA402|accessdate=30 August 2011|date=September 1929|publisher=Hearst Magazines|pages=402–404|issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[William Mudford]]'s most famous tale{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} is the short story "[[The Iron Shroud]]", a classic predicament story, describes the plight of a noble Italian hero who is confined in a continuously and imperceptibly contracting iron torture chamber at Tolfi castle. The chamber walls and ceiling are slowly contracting, day by day, through mechanical means, to the point of eventually crushing and enveloping the victim, thus metaphorically becoming his iron shroud. 
*Mulford's story provided Edgar Allan Poe with the idea of the shrinking cell in his short story "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]" (1842).

====Opera====
*In ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'' the torture chamber is introduced with its own music while there is a dramatic scene where Judith and Bluebeard make reference to the torture chamber and the red light of its interior that escapes through its open door. The torture chamber musical introduction possesses a circular form with the introduction repeating, in a shorter form, at the conclusion of the torture chamber scene. This is in contrast to the rest of the musical composition of the opera which is ''[[through-composed]]''.&lt;ref name="Carolina1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greensboro Carl S. Leafstedt Assistant Professor of Music University of North Carolina|title=Inside Bluebeard's Castle : Music and Drama in Bela Bartok's Opera: Music and Drama in Bela Bartok's Opera|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNVAmHBbULgC&amp;pg=PA91|date=11 October 1999|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-535505-5|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Video games====
*The protagonist in [[Exidy]]'s [[light gun]] shooter ''[[Chiller (video game)|Chiller]]'' (1986) is a torturer who advances through dungeon levels, maiming and killing helpless enemies. When it was [[Porting|ported]] from arcades to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], the enemies were [[dehumanization|portrayed as]] undead monsters, risen by an evil force and threatening a village. Both versions sold poorly, due to their gratuitous [[graphic violence]], which was uncommon in [[Western world|Western]] mass media at the time.

This is a high-tech torture chamber, complete with loops of heavy chain, bone-crushing presses, fiery furnaces and thick electrical cables that snake ominously across the floor. The good news is that all of these cruel devices are used solely on…aircraft components."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Uncanny valley.png|thumb|350px|An empirically estimated uncanny valley for static robot face images&lt;ref name="Mathur2016"/&gt;]]

In [[aesthetics]], the '''uncanny valley''' is a hypothesized relationship between the degree of an object's resemblance to a human being and the emotional response to such an object. The concept of the uncanny valley suggests [[humanoid]] objects which appear almost, but not exactly, like real human beings elicit [[uncanny]], or strangely familiar, feelings of eeriness and revulsion in observers.&lt;ref name="MacDormanIshiguro2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacDorman | first1 = K. F. | last2 = Ishiguro | first2 = H. | year = 2006 | title = The uncanny advantage of using androids in social and cognitive science research | url = | journal = Interaction Studies | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 297–337 | doi = 10.1075/is.7.3.03mac | title-link = Android (robot) }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Valley'' denotes a dip in the human observer's affinity for the replica, a relation that otherwise increases with the replica's human likeness.&lt;ref name="MacDormanChattoPadhyay2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacDorman | first1 = K.

Examples can be found in robotics, 3D computer animations, and lifelike dolls among others.  With the increasing prevalence of virtual reality, augmented reality, and photorealistic computer animation, the 'valley' has been cited in the popular press in reaction to the [[verisimilitude]] of the creation as it approaches indistinguishability from reality. The uncanny valley hypothesis predicts an entity appearing almost human risks eliciting cold, eerie feelings in viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacDorman|first=Karl F.|last2=Chattopadhyay|first2=Debaleena|title=Categorization-based stranger avoidance does not explain the uncanny valley effect|journal=Cognition|volume=161|pages=132–135|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2017.01.009|pmid=28109534|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The concept was identified by the robotics professor [[Masahiro Mori (roboticist)|Masahiro Mori]] as ''bukimi no tani genshō'' ({{lang|ja|不気味の谷現象}}) in 1970.&lt;ref name="Mori2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mori | first = M. | translator1-last = MacDorman | translator1-first = K.

==Hypothesis==
Mori's original hypothesis states that as the appearance of a robot is made more human, some observers' emotional response to the robot becomes increasingly positive and [[empathy|empathetic]], until it reaches a point beyond which the response quickly becomes strong revulsion. However, as the robot's appearance continues to become less distinguishable from a human being, the emotional response becomes positive once again and approaches human-to-human empathy levels.&lt;ref name=mori33&gt;

This area of repulsive response aroused by a robot with appearance and motion between a "barely human" and "fully human" entity is the uncanny valley. The name captures the idea that an almost human-looking robot seems overly "strange" to some human beings, produces a feeling of [[uncanniness]], and thus fails to evoke the empathic response required for productive [[human–robot interaction]].&lt;ref name=mori33/&gt;

==Theoretical basis==

A number of theories have been proposed to explain the cognitive mechanism underlying the phenomenon:
* '''Mate selection.''' Automatic, stimulus-driven appraisals of uncanny stimuli elicit aversion by activating an evolved [[cognitive]] mechanism for the avoidance of [[Mate choice|selecting mates]] with low [[fertility]], poor [[Endocrine system|hormonal health]], or ineffective [[immune system]]s based on visible features of the face and body that are predictive of those traits.&lt;ref name=Green2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = R.

A. (eds) (2002). Facial Attractiveness: Evolutionary, Cognitive, and Social Perspectives, Ablex Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Mortality salience]].''' Viewing an "uncanny" robot elicits an innate fear of death and culturally-supported defenses for coping with death’s inevitability.... [P]artially disassembled androids...play on subconscious fears of reduction, replacement, and annihilation: (1) A mechanism with a human façade and a mechanical interior plays on our subconscious fear that we are all just soulless machines. (2) Androids in various states of mutilation, decapitation, or disassembly are reminiscent of a battlefield after a conflict and, as such, serve as a reminder of our mortality. (3) Since most androids are copies of actual people, they are [[doppelgänger]]s and may elicit a fear of being replaced, on the job, in a relationship, and so on. (4) The jerkiness of an android’s movements could be unsettling because it elicits a fear of losing bodily control."&lt;ref&gt;MacDorman &amp; Ishiguro, 2006, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Pathogen]] avoidance.''' Uncanny stimuli may activate a cognitive mechanism that originally evolved to motivate the avoidance of potential sources of pathogens by eliciting a disgust response. "The more human an organism looks, the stronger the aversion to its defects, because (1) defects indicate disease, (2) more human-looking organisms are more closely related to human beings genetically, and (3) the probability of contracting disease-causing [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], and other [[parasite]]s increases with genetic similarity."&lt;ref name="Rhodes, G. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDorman, Green, Ho, &amp; Koch, 2009, p. 696.&lt;/ref&gt; The visual anomalies of androids, robots, and other animated human characters cause reactions of alarm and revulsion, similar to corpses and visibly diseased individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=S. Craig|title=Applied Evolutionary Psychology|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199586073|page=423}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Sorites paradox]]es.''' Stimuli with human and nonhuman traits undermine our sense of human identity by linking qualitatively different categories, human and nonhuman, by a quantitative metric, degree of human likeness.&lt;ref&gt;Ramey, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Violation of human norms.''' The uncanny valley may "be symptomatic of entities that elicit a model of a human other but do not measure up to it".&lt;ref&gt;MacDorman &amp; Ishiguro, 2006, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; If an entity looks sufficiently nonhuman, its human characteristics are noticeable, generating empathy. However, if the entity looks almost human, it elicits our model of a human other and its detailed normative expectations. The nonhuman characteristics are noticeable, giving the human viewer a sense of strangeness. In other words, a robot stuck inside the uncanny valley is no longer judged by the standards of a robot doing a passable job at pretending to be human, but is instead judged by the standards of a human doing a terrible job at acting like a normal person. This has been linked to perceptual uncertainty and the theory of predictive coding.&lt;ref name = "SayginSCAN"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Saygin| first=A.P.|title=The Thing That Should Not Be: Predictive Coding and the Uncanny Valley in Perceiving Human and Humanoid Robot Actions. |journal=Social Cognitive Affective Neuroscience| year=2011 | volume = 7| issue=4| pages = 413–22| url=http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/413 | doi=10.1093/scan/nsr025| pmid=21515639| pmc=3324571}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=UCSD News|title=Your Brain on Androids|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/soc/20110714BrainAndroids.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Religious definition of human identity.''' The existence of artificial but humanlike entities is viewed by some as a threat to the concept of human identity.&lt;ref&gt;MacDorman, K. F., Vasudevan, S. K., &amp; Ho, C.-C., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; An example can be found in the theoretical framework of psychiatrist [[Irvin Yalom]]. Yalom explains that humans construct psychological defenses in order to avoid existential anxiety stemming from death. One of these defenses is ''specialness'', the irrational belief that aging and death as central premises of life apply to all others but oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Yalom, Irvin D. (1980) "Existential Psychotherapy", Basic Books, Inc., Publishers, New York&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of the very humanlike "living" robot can be so rich and compelling that it challenges humans' notions of "specialness" and existential defenses, eliciting existential anxiety. In folklore, the creation of human-like, but soulless, beings is often shown to be unwise, as with the [[golem]] in Judaism, whose absence of human empathy and spirit can lead to disaster, however good the intentions of its creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472117598-intro.pdf|title=Introduction to ''The Golem Returns''|author=Cathy S. Gelbin|year=2011|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Conflicting perceptual cues.''' The negative effect associated with uncanny stimuli is produced by the activation of conflicting cognitive representations. Perceptual tension occurs when an individual perceives conflicting cues to [[Categorization|category]] membership, such as when a humanoid figure moves like a robot, or has other visible robot features. This cognitive conflict is experienced as psychological discomfort (i.e., "eeriness"), much like the discomfort that is experienced with [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref name="Ferrey2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferrey | first1 = A.

Mathur and Reichling found that the time subjects took to gauge a robot face's human- or mechanical-resemblance peaked for faces deepest in the uncanny valley, suggesting that perceptually classifying these faces as "human" or "robot" posed a greater cognitive challenge.&lt;ref name="Mathur2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mathur | first1 = Maya B. | last2 = Reichling | first2 = David B.| year = 2016 | title = Navigating a social world with robot partners: a quantitative cartography of the Uncanny Valley | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027715300640 | format = PDF | journal = Cognition | volume = 146 | issue = | pages = 22–32 | doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2015.09.008 | pmid=26402646}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they found that while perceptual confusion coincided with the uncanny valley, it did not mediate the effect of the uncanny valley on subjects' social and emotional reactions—suggesting that perceptual confusion may not be the mechanism behind the uncanny valley effect.

===Research===
A series of studies experimentally investigated whether uncanny valley effects exist for static images of robot faces. Mathur MB &amp; Reichling DB&lt;ref name="Mathur2016"/&gt; used two complementary sets of stimuli spanning the range from very mechanical to very human-like: first, a sample of 80 objectively chosen robot face images from Internet searches, and second, a morphometrically and graphically controlled 6-face series set of faces. They asked subjects to explicitly rate the likability of each face. To measure trust toward each face, subjects completed a one-shot investment game to indirectly measure how much money they were willing to "wager" on a robot's trustworthiness. Both stimulus sets showed a robust uncanny valley effect on explicitly-rated likability and a more context-dependent uncanny valley on implicitly-rated trust. Their exploratory analysis of one proposed mechanism for the uncanny valley, perceptual confusion at a category boundary, found that category confusion occurs in the uncanny valley but does not mediate the effect on social and emotional responses.

One study conducted in 2009 examined the evolutionary mechanism behind the aversion associated with the uncanny valley. A group of five monkeys were shown three images: two different 3D&amp;nbsp;monkey faces (realistic, unrealistic), and a real photo of a monkey's face. The monkeys' eye-gaze was used as a proxy for preference or aversion. Since the realistic 3D&amp;nbsp;monkey face was looked at less than either the real photo, or the unrealistic 3D&amp;nbsp;monkey face, this was interpreted as an indication that the monkey participants found the realistic 3D&amp;nbsp;face aversive, or otherwise preferred the other two images. As one would expect with the uncanny valley, more realism can lead to less positive reactions, and this study demonstrated that neither human-specific cognitive processes, nor human culture explain the uncanny valley. In other words, this aversive reaction to realism can be said to be evolutionary in origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kitta MacPherson |url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S25/53/99A37/index.xml?section=topstories |title=Monkey visual behavior falls into the uncanny valley |publisher= Princeton University |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design principles==
A number of design principles have been proposed for avoiding the uncanny valley:
* '''Design elements should match in human realism.''' A robot may look uncanny when human and nonhuman elements are mixed.&lt;ref&gt;Ho, MacDorman, Pramono, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, both a robot with a synthetic voice or a human being with a human voice have been found to be less eerie than a robot with a human voice or a human being with a synthetic voice.&lt;ref name="Mitchell et al., 2011"&gt;Mitchell et al., 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For a robot to give a more positive impression, its degree of human realism in appearance should also match its degree of human realism in behavior.&lt;ref name="Goetz, Kiesler, &amp; Powers, 2003"&gt;Goetz, Kiesler, &amp; Powers, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; If an animated character looks more human than its movement, this gives a negative impression.&lt;ref&gt;Vinayagamoorthy, Steed, &amp; Slater, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Human neuroimaging studies also indicate matching appearance and motion kinematics are important.&lt;ref name="SayginSCAN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saygin2010"&gt;Saygin, A.P., Chaminade, T., Ishiguro, H. (2010) The Perception of Humans and Robots: Uncanny Hills in Parietal Cortex. Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 2716-2720).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saygin2011"&gt;Saygin et al., 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reducing conflict and uncertainty by matching appearance, behavior, and ability.''' In terms of performance, if a robot looks too appliance-like, people expect little from it; if it looks too human, people expect too much from it.&lt;ref name="Goetz, Kiesler, &amp; Powers, 2003"/&gt; A highly human-like appearance leads to an expectation that certain behaviors are present, such as humanlike motion dynamics. This likely operates at a sub-conscious level and may have a biological basis. Neuroscientists have noted "when the brain's expectations are not met, the brain...generates a 'prediction error'. As human-like artificial agents become more commonplace, perhaps our perceptual systems will be re-tuned to accommodate these new social partners. Or perhaps, we will decide "it is not a good idea to make [robots] so clearly in our image after all."&lt;ref name="SayginSCAN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saygin2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gaylord|first=Chris|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Tech/2011/0914/Uncanny-Valley-Will-we-ever-learn-to-live-with-artificial-humans|title=Uncanny Valley: Will we ever learn to live with artificial humans?|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Human facial proportions and photorealistic texture should only be used together.''' A photorealistic human texture demands human facial proportions, or the computer generated character can fall into the uncanny valley. Abnormal facial proportions, including those typically used by artists to enhance attractiveness (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;larger eyes), can look eerie with a photorealistic human texture. Avoiding a photorealistic texture can permit more leeway.&lt;ref name="MacDorman, Green 2009"&gt;MacDorman, Green, Ho, &amp; Koch, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
A number of criticisms have been raised concerning whether the uncanny valley exists as a unified phenomenon amenable to scientific scrutiny:
* '''Good design can lift human-looking entities out of the valley.''' [[David Hanson (robotics designer)|David Hanson]] has criticized Mori's hypothesis that entities approaching human appearance will necessarily be evaluated negatively.&lt;ref name="Hanson, 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hanson | first1 = David | last2 = Olney | first2 = Andrew | last3 = Pereira | first3 = Ismar A. | last4 = Zielke | first4 = Marge | year = 2005 | title = Upending the Uncanny Valley | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 1728–1729 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has shown that the uncanny valley that Karl MacDorman and Hiroshi Ishiguro&lt;ref&gt;MacDorman &amp; Ishiguro, 2006, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; generated – by having participants rate photographs that morphed from humanoid robots to android robots to human beings – could be flattened out by adding [[Neoteny|neotenous]], cartoonish features to the entities that had formerly fallen into the valley.&lt;ref name="Hanson, 2005"/&gt; This approach uses the fact that humans find characteristics appealing that are reminiscent of the young of our own (as well as many other) species, as used in cartoons.
* '''The uncanny appears at any degree of human likeness.''' Hanson has also pointed out that uncanny entities may appear anywhere in a spectrum ranging from the abstract (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[MIT]]'s robot Lazlo) to the perfectly human (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;cosmetically atypical people).&lt;ref name="Hanson, 2005"/&gt; [[Capgras delusion]] is a relatively rare condition in which the sufferer believes that people (or, in some cases, things) have been replaced with duplicates. These duplicates are rationally accepted as identical in physical properties, but the irrational belief is held that the "true" entity has been replaced with something else. Some sufferers of Capgras delusion claim that the duplicate is a robot. Ellis and Lewis argue that the delusion arises from an intact system for overt recognition coupled with a damaged system for covert recognition, which leads to conflict over an individual being identifiable but not familiar in any emotional sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = H. | last2 = Lewis | first2 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Capgras delusion: A window on face recognition | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 149–156 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01620-x| pmid = 11287268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the view that the uncanny valley could arise due to issues of categorical perception that are particular to the way the brain processes information.&lt;ref name="Saygin2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollick, F. In Search of the Uncanny Valley. Analog communication: Evolution, brain mechanisms, dynamics, simulation. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press: The Vienna Series in Theoretical Biology (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The uncanny valley is a [[wikt:heterogeneous|heterogeneous]] group of phenomena.''' Phenomena labeled as being in the uncanny valley can be diverse, involve different sense modalities, and have multiple, possibly overlapping causes, which can range from evolved or learned circuits for early face perception&lt;ref name="MacDorman, Green 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDorman &amp; Ishiguro, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to culturally-shared psychological constructs.&lt;ref&gt;MacDorman, Vasudevan &amp; Ho, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; People's cultural backgrounds may have a considerable influence on how androids are perceived with respect to the uncanny valley.&lt;ref&gt;Bartneck Kanda, Ishiguro, &amp; Hagita, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The uncanny valley may be generational.''' Younger generations, more used to CGI, robots, and such, may be less likely to be affected by this hypothesized issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Annalee |last=Newitz |url=http://io9.com/is-the-uncanny-valley-a-myth-1239355550 |title=Is the "uncanny valley" a myth? |publisher=Io9.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar effects==
An effect similar to the uncanny valley was noted by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1839:
{{quote|The expression of this &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Lachesis muta|Trigonocephalus]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; snake’s face was hideous and fierce; the pupil consisted of a vertical slit in a mottled and coppery iris; the jaws were broad at the base, and the nose terminated in a triangular projection. I do not think I ever saw anything more ugly, excepting, perhaps, some of the [[vampire bat]]s. I imagine this repulsive aspect originates from the features being placed in positions, with respect to each other, somewhat proportional to the human face; and thus we obtain a scale of hideousness.|Charles Darwin|''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]''&lt;ref&gt;Charles Darwin. ''The Voyage of the Beagle ''. New York: Modern Library. 2001. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A similar "uncanny valley" effect could, according to the ethical-futurist writer Jamais Cascio, show up when humans begin modifying themselves with [[transhuman]] enhancements (cf. [[body modification]]), which aim to improve the abilities of the human body beyond what would normally be possible, be it [[eyesight]], [[muscle]] strength, or [[cognition]].&lt;ref name=openthefuture&gt;Jamais Cascio, [http://www.openthefuture.com/2007/10/the_second_uncanny_valley.html The Second Uncanny Valley]&lt;/ref&gt; So long as these enhancements remain within a perceived norm of human behavior, a negative reaction is unlikely, but once individuals supplant normal human variety, revulsion can be expected. However, according to this theory, once such technologies gain further distance from human norms, "[[transhuman]]" individuals would cease to be judged on human levels and instead be regarded as separate entities altogether (this point is what has been dubbed "[[posthuman]]"), and it is here that acceptance would rise once again out of the uncanny valley.&lt;ref name=openthefuture /&gt; Another example comes from "pageant retouching" photos, especially of children, which some find disturbingly doll-like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Erinhurt |url=http://viz.cwrl.utexas.edu/node/235 |title=Retouching memories? |publisher=University of Texas |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2011-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226082858/http://viz.cwrl.utexas.edu/node/235 |archive-date=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to rapid advancements in the areas of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[affective computing]], cognitive scientists have also suggested the possibility of an "Uncanny Valley of Mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-10-01|title=Feeling robots and human zombies: Mind perception and the uncanny valley|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027712001278|journal=Cognition|language=en|volume=125|issue=1|pages=125–130|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2012.06.007|pmid=22784682|issn=0010-0277|last1=Gray|first1=Kurt|last2=Wegner|first2=Daniel M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-03-01|title=Venturing into the uncanny valley of mind—The influence of mind attribution on the acceptance of human-like characters in a virtual reality setting|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027716303055|journal=Cognition|language=en|volume=160|pages=43–50|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2016.12.010|pmid=28043026|issn=0010-0277|last1=Stein|first1=Jan-Philipp|last2=Ohler|first2=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, people might experience strong feelings of aversion if they encounter highly advanced, emotion-sensitive technology. Among the possible explanations for this phenomenon, both a perceived loss of human uniqueness and expectations of immediate physical harm are discussed by contemporary research.

==In computer animation and special effects==
A number of films that use [[computer-generated imagery]] to show characters have been described by reviewers as giving a feeling of revulsion or "creepiness" as a result of the characters looking too realistic. Examples include the following:

* According to roboticist [[Dario Floreano]], the baby character Billy in [[Pixar]]'s groundbreaking 1988 animated short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'' provoked negative audience reactions, which first led the film industry to take the concept of the uncanny valley seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Dario Floreano]] | url=http://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/resource/view.php?inpopup=true&amp;id=41111 | title=Bio-Mimetic Robotics }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]]. http://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/resource/view.php?inpopup=true&amp;id=41121{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2001 film ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'', the first [[photorealistic]] computer-animated feature film, provoked negative reactions from some viewers due to its near-realistic yet imperfect visual depictions of human characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eveleth|first=Rose|title=BBC – Future – Robots: Is the uncanny valley real?|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130901-is-the-uncanny-valley-real|publisher=BBC.com|date=September 2, 2013|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wissler|first=Virginia|title=Illuminated Pixels: The Why, What, and How of Digital Lighting|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|date=2013|location=|page=171|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8XcLAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;dq=final+fantasy+the+spirits+within+uncanny+valley#v=onepage&amp;q=final%20fantasy%20the%20spirits%20within%20uncanny%20valley&amp;f=false|doi=|id=|isbn=978-1-4354-5635-8|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plantec|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Plantec|title=Crossing the Great Uncanny Valley – Animation World Network|url=http://www.awn.com/vfxworld/crossing-great-uncanny-valley|publisher=AWN.com|date=December 19, 2007|accessdate=August 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' critic [[Peter Bradshaw]] stated that while the film's animation is brilliant, the "solemnly realist human faces look shriekingly phoney precisely because they're almost there but not quite".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/aug/03/culture.reviews1|title=Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within – Film – The Guardian|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Bradshaw|date=August 2, 2001|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' critic [[Peter Travers]] wrote of the film, "At first it's fun to watch the characters, […] But then you notice a coldness in the eyes, a mechanical quality in the movements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/final-fantasy-20010706|title=Final Fantasy – Rolling Stone|last=Travers|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Travers|date=July 6, 2001|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Several reviewers of the 2004 animated film ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'' called its animation eerie. CNN.com reviewer [[Paul Clinton]] wrote, "Those human characters in the film come across as downright... well, creepy. So ''The Polar Express'' is at best disconcerting, and at worst, a wee bit horrifying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2004-11-10/entertainment/review.polar.express_1_polar-express-film-series-sensors?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ | title=Polar Express a creepy ride | publisher=CNN.com | date=Nov 10, 2004 | accessdate=Nov 21, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810181308/http://articles.cnn.com/2004-11-10/entertainment/review.polar.express_1_polar-express-film-series-sensors?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ | archive-date=2011-08-10 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "eerie" was used by reviewers [[Kurt Loder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1493616/kurt-loder-on-polar-express.jhtml |title='The Polar Express' Is All Too Human |publisher=MTV |date=November 10, 2004 |first=Kurt |last=Loder}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Manohla Dargis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/10/movies/do-you-hear-sleigh-bells-nah-just-tom-hanks-and-some-train.html?_r=0|title=Do You Hear Sleigh Bells? Nah, Just Tom Hanks and Some Train |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 10, 2004 |first=Manohla |last=Dargis}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. ''[[Newsday]]'' reviewer John Anderson called the film's characters "creepy" and "dead-eyed", and wrote that "The Polar Express is a zombie train".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/movie-review-1.620836|title='Polar Express' derails in zombie land |publisher=Newsday |date=November 10, 2004 |first=John |last=Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animation director Ward Jenkins wrote an online analysis describing how changes to the ''Polar Express'' characters' appearance, especially to their eyes and eyebrows, could have avoided what he considered a feeling of deadness in their faces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wardomatic.blogspot.com/2004/12/polar-express-virtual-train-wreck_18.html The Polar Express: A Virtual Train Wreck (conclusion)], Ward Jenkins, ''Ward-O-Matic'' blog, December 18, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a review of the 2007 animated film ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'', ''[[New York Times]]'' technology writer David Gallagher wrote that the film failed the uncanny valley test, stating that the film's villain, the monster [[Grendel]], was "only slightly scarier" than the "closeups of our hero [[Beowulf (hero)|Beowulf]]'s face... allowing viewers to admire every hair in his 3-D digital stubble".&lt;ref name="digital in beowulf"&gt;[http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/digital-actors-in-beowulf-are-just-uncanny/ Digital Actors in ‘Beowulf’ Are Just Uncanny] - ''New York Times'', November 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some reviewers of the 2009 animated film ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'' criticized its animation as creepy. Joe Neumaier of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' said of the film, "The motion-capture does no favors to co-stars [Gary] Oldman, Colin Firth and Robin Wright Penn, since, as in 'Polar Express,' the animated eyes never seem to focus. And for all the photorealism, when characters get wiggly-limbed and bouncy as in standard Disney cartoons, it's off-putting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Neumaier|first=Joe|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/blah-humbug-christmas-carol-3-d-spin-dickens-parts-lacks-spirit-article-1.414317|title=Blah, humbug!

* In the 2010 live-action film ''[[The Last Airbender]]'', the character [[Appa (character)|Appa]], the flying bison, has been called "uncanny". [[Geekosystem]]'s Susana Polo found the character "really quite creepy", noting "that prey animals (like bison) have eyes on the sides of their heads, and so moving them to the front without changing rest of the facial structure tips us right into the uncanny valley".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Susana|last=Polo|title=New ''Airbender'' TV Spot: Appa's Creepy Face|url=http://www.geekosystem.com/airbender-appa-creepy-face|date=June 20, 2010|accessdate=December 11, 2012|publisher=Geekosystem}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2010 live-action film ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'' features a computer-generated young version of actor [[Jeff Bridges]] (as a young [[List of Tron characters#Kevin Flynn|Kevin Flynn]] and [[List of Tron characters#Clu 2|Clu]]), which reviewers have criticized as creepy. Vic Holtreman of Screen Rant wrote, "Finally we get to the CGI recreation of Jeff Bridges as a young man. Have we finally gotten past the 'uncanny valley' (where the mind/eye discerns that something is just not quite 'real')? Sadly, no. As long as young Kevin Flynn wasn’t talking, the face looked great – but as soon as he spoke, the creepy factor pops up. He looked like he had a face full of Botox […] One could argue that Clu was a computer program and should have been 'stiff' compared to a human, but even in the opening scene of the film where we see the real-world young Kevin Flynn, the same effect is present".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/tron-legacy-reviews-vic-92655/|title='TRON: Legacy' Review – Screen Rant|last=Holtreman|first=Vic|date=December 16, 2010|publisher=Screenrant.com|access-date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the appearance of young Kevin was "a simulacrum that here looks like an animated death mask".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|author-link=Manohla Dargis|date=December 16, 2010|title=Following in Father’s Parallel-Universe Footsteps|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/movies/17tron.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amy Biancolli of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' wrote, "Regarding Bridges' digital de-aging: It's creepy. It's a little less creepy on Clu's face (he's not human, anyway) than on Kevin's in a scene from 1989, but on either of them it has the waxen look of storefront [[mannequins]] - or over-Botoxed socialites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Biancolli|first=Amy|date=December 16, 2010|title=TRON: Legacy – Houston Chronicle|url=http://www.chron.com/entertainment/movies/article/TRON-Legacy-1712822.php|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|access-date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2011 animated film ''[[Mars Needs Moms]]'' was widely criticized for being creepy and unnatural because of its style of animation.

* Reviewers had mixed opinions regarding whether the 2011 animated film ''[[The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn]]'' was affected by the uncanny valley. Daniel D. Snyder of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote, "Instead of trying to bring to life Herge’s beautiful artwork, Spielberg and co. have opted to bring the movie into the 3D era using trendy motion-capture technique to recreate Tintin and his friends. Tintin’s original face, while barebones, never suffered for a lack of expression. It’s now outfitted with an alien and unfamiliar visage, his plastic skin dotted with pores and subtle wrinkles." He added, "In bringing them to life, Spielberg has made the characters dead.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Snyder|first=Daniel D.|date=December 26, 2011|title='Tintin' and the Curious Case of the Dead Eyes|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/12/tintin-and-the-curious-case-of-the-dead-eyes/250432/|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; N.B. of ''[[The Economist]]'' called elements of the animation "grotesque", writing, "Tintin, Captain Haddock and the others exist in settings that are almost photo-realistic, and nearly all of their features are those of flesh-and-blood people.

* The 2015 live-action film ''[[Terminator Genisys]]'' contains a scene featuring a computer-generated young version of actor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] (as a young [[Terminator (character)|T-800 Terminator]]), which some reviewers thought was affected by the uncanny valley. Eric Mungenast of the ''[[East Valley Tribune]]'' wrote of the film, "One notable technological problem stems from the attempt to make old Schwarzenegger look young again with some digital manipulation — it definitely doesn’t cross over the uncanny valley".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mungenast|first=Eric|date=July 2, 2015|title='Terminator Genisys' more than adequate|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/get_out/movies/article_7657c5c0-2103-11e5-b073-1fba99814591.html|newspaper=[[East Valley Tribune]]|access-date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and reviewer Simon Prior wrote of the film, "Even the 'Synthespian' version of Arnie isn’t as horrific as you might expect, although it’s still clear that CGI hasn’t yet conquered the Uncanny Valley issue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonprior.com/terminator-genisys-2015/|title=Terminator: Genisys (2015) review|last=Prior|first=Simon|date=February 2, 2016|publisher=Simonprior.com|access-date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The film's predecessor, 2009's ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'', also has a scene with a CG young Schwarzenegger that provoked similar reactions from some viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideonexus.com/2009/10/15/will-james-camerons-avatar-escape-the-uncanny-valley/|title=Will James Cameron's Avatar Escape the Uncanny Valley?|last=Somma|first=Ryan|date=October 15, 2009|publisher=Ideonexus.com|access-date=March 20, 2016|quote=''Terminator: Salvation'' took advantage of the spooky effect, intentionally or not, with a computer animated Arnold Schwarzenegger cameo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/blogs/members/b/shootist2600_blog/archive/2009/12/07/scaling-the-uncanny-valley.aspx|title=Scaling the Uncanny Valley|last=Wadsworth|first=Kyle|date=December 7, 2009|publisher=[[Gameinformer.com]]|access-date=March 20, 2016|quote=This would be a welcome counterpoint to the relatively poor rendering of a virtual Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator Salvation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but unlike in the newer film, this earlier version does not speak.)
* The 2016 live-action film ''[[Rogue One]]'' features the CGI likenesses of the deceased [[Peter Cushing]] and a young [[Carrie Fisher]] "reprising" their respective roles of [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] and [[Princess Leia]]. Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote, "The Tarkin that appears in Rogue One is a mix of CGI and live-action, and it… doesn't work. — In fact, for a special effect that's still stuck in the depths of the uncanny valley, it's surprising just how much of the movie Tarkin appears in, quietly undermining every scene he's in by somehow seeming less real than the various inhuman aliens in the movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|date=December 18, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|title='Rogue One': That Familiar Face Isn't Familiar Enough|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rogue-one-grand-moff-tarkins-familiar-face-isnt-familiar-957178|access-date=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly Lawler of ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote, "the Leia cameo is so jarring as to take the audience completely out of the film at its most emotional moment.

[[File:Leafyseadragon2276ppx PLW edit.JPG|thumb|237px|[[Leafy sea dragon]] avoids recognition by predators, with alga-like coloration, protuberances and behaviour]]

'''Underwater camouflage''' is the set of methods of achieving [[crypsis]]—avoidance of observation—that allows otherwise visible aquatic [[organism]]s to remain unnoticed by other organisms such as [[predator]]s or [[prey]].

[[Camouflage]] in large bodies of water differs markedly from camouflage on land. The environment is essentially the same on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable background{{efn|The zoologist [[Peter Herring]] notes that even the word "background" is land-based.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–195}} But the sea surface is continually changing.}} to compare with trees and bushes. Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and [[counter-illumination]]. Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.

Camouflage in relatively shallow waters is more like terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by many animals. For example, self-decoration is employed by [[decorator crab]]s; [[mimesis]] by animals such as the [[leafy sea dragon]]; [[countershading]] by many fish including [[shark]]s; distraction with [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]] by many fish; [[active camouflage]] through ability to change colour rapidly in [[fish]] such as the flounder, and [[cephalopod]]s including [[octopus]], [[cuttlefish]], and [[squid]].

== Context ==
{{main article|Camouflage}}

The ability to camouflage oneself provides a survival advantage in the constant struggle between [[predator]]s and [[prey]]. [[Natural selection]] has produced a wide variety of methods of survival in the oceans.&lt;ref name="Sewell"&gt;{{cite web |title=Aquarium Fish: Physical Crypsis: Mimicry and Camouflage |author=Sewell, Aaron |date=March 2010 |url=http://www.advancedaquarist.com/2010/3/fish2 |accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Aristotle]] commented on the color-changing abilities, both for camouflage and for signalling, of [[cephalopod]]s including the [[octopus]], in his ''[[Historia animalium]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]]. ''[[Historia Animalium]]''. IX, 622a: 2-10. About 400 BC. Cited in Luciana Borrelli, [[Francesca Gherardi]], Graziano Fiorito. ''A catalogue of body patterning in Cephalopoda''.

These methods of camouflage are described in turn below.

===Transparency===
[[File:Expl0469 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Many animals of the open sea, like this ''[[Aurelia labiata]]'' jellyfish, are largely transparent.]]

Transparency is common, even dominant, in animals of the open sea, especially those that live in relatively shallow waters. It is found in [[plankton]] of many species, as well as larger animals such as [[jellyfish]], [[salps]] (floating [[tunicates]]), and [[comb jellies]].{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–195}}
Many marine animals that float near the surface are highly [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]], giving them almost perfect camouflage.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} However, transparency is difficult for bodies made of materials that have different [[refractive index|refractive indices]] from seawater. Some marine animals such as [[jellyfish]] have gelatinous bodies, composed mainly of water; their thick mesogloea is acellular and highly transparent. This conveniently makes them [[buoyancy|buoyant]], but it also makes them large for their muscle mass, so they cannot swim fast.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} Gelatinous [[plankton]]ic animals are between 50 and 90 per cent transparent. A transparency of 50 per cent is enough to make an animal invisible to a predator such as [[cod]] at a depth of {{convert|650|m|ft}}; better transparency is required for invisibility in shallower water, where the light is brighter and predators can see better. For example, a cod can see prey that are 98 per cent transparent in optimal lighting in shallow water. Therefore, transparency is most effective in deeper waters.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}}

[[File:2 - Aphia minuta 03-11-06 DSCF4095.jpg|thumb|The [[transparent goby]]]]

Some tissues such as [[muscle]]s can be made transparent, provided either they are very thin or organised as regular layers or fibrils that are small compared to the wavelength of visible light. Familiar examples of transparent body parts are the lens and [[cornea]] of the vertebrate [[eye]]. The lens is made of the protein [[crystallin]]; the [[cornea]] is made of the protein [[collagen]].{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} Other structures cannot be made transparent, notably the [[retina]]s or equivalent light-absorbing structures of eyes — they must absorb light to be able to function. The [[camera]]-type eye of vertebrates and cephalopods must be completely opaque.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} Finally, some structures are visible for a reason, such as to lure prey. For example, the [[nematocyst]]s (stinging cells) of the transparent [[siphonophore]] ''[[Agalma okenii]]'' resemble small [[copepod]]s.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}} Examples of transparent marine animals include a wide variety of [[larva]]e, including [[coelenterates]], siphonophores, salps, [[gastropoda|gastropod molluscs]], [[polychaete]] worms, many shrimplike [[crustaceans]], and fish; whereas the adults of most of these are opaque and pigmented, resembling the seabed or shores where they live.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=190–191}}{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=6}} Adult comb jellies and jellyfish are mainly transparent, like their watery background.{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=6}} The small [[Amazon river]] fish ''[[Microphilypnus amazonicus]]'' and the shrimps it associates with, ''[[Pseudopalaemon gouldingi]]'', are so transparent as to be "almost invisible"; further, these species appear to select whether to be transparent or more conventionally mottled (disruptively patterned) according to the local background in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1679-62252006000200008&amp;script=sci_arttext | title=The almost invisible league: crypsis and association between minute fishes and shrimps as a possible defence against visually hunting predators |author1=Carvalho, Lucélia Nobre |author2=Zuanon, Jansen |author3=Sazima, Ivan | journal=[[Neotropical Ichthyology]] |date=April–June 2006 | volume=4 | issue=2 | pages=219–224 | doi=10.1590/S1679-62252006000200008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reflection===
[[File:Herringadultkils2.jpg|thumb|left|The adult herring,''[[Clupea harengus]]'', is a typical silvered fish of medium depths.]]
[[File:Herring Silvering.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|The herring's reflectors are nearly vertical for camouflage from the side.]]

Many fish are covered with highly reflective scales, giving the appearance of [[silver]]ed [[mirror]] glass. Reflection through silvering is widespread or dominant in fish of the open sea, especially those that live in the top 100 metres. Where transparency cannot be achieved, it can be imitated effectively by silvering to make an animal's body highly reflective. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side. Most fish in the upper ocean such as [[sardine]] and [[herring]] are camouflaged by silvering.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=193–195}}

The [[marine hatchetfish]] is extremely flattened laterally (side to side), leaving the body just millimetres thick, and the body is so silvery as to resemble [[aluminium foil]]. The mirrors consist of microscopic structures similar to those used to provide [[structural coloration]]: stacks of between 5 and 10 crystals of [[guanine]] spaced about ¼ of a wavelength apart to interfere constructively and achieve nearly 100 per cent reflection. In the deep waters that the hatchetfish lives in, only blue light with a wavelength of 500 nanometres percolates down and needs to be reflected, so mirrors 125 nanometres apart provide good camouflage.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=193–195}}

In fish such as the herring which live in shallower water, the mirrors must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks with a range of different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=193–195}} Silvering is found in other marine animals as well as fish. The [[cephalopods]], including squid, octopus and cuttlefish, have multi-layer mirrors made of protein rather than guanine.{{sfn|Herring|2002|pages=193–195}}

===Counter-illumination===
[[File:Squid Counterillumination.png|thumb|Principle of squid [[counter-illumination]]]]
{{main article|Counter-illumination}}
Counter-illumination through [[bioluminescence]] on the underside (ventral region) of the body is found in many species that live in the open ocean down to about 1000 metres. The generated light increases an animal's brightness when seen from below to match the brightness of the ocean surface; it is an effective form of [[active camouflage]]. It is notably used by some species of [[squid]], such as the [[Abralia veranyi|midwater squid]], ''Abralia veranyi''. These have light-producing organs ([[photophores]]) scattered all over their undersides, creating a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below.&lt;ref name="Abralia with photo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-photos/midwater-squid-abralia-veranyi | title=Midwater Squid, Abralia veranyi | publisher=[[Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]] | accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-illumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/1983/00000033/00000004/art00003 | title=Oceanic Bioluminescence: an Overview of General Functions | author=Young, Richard Edward | journal=[[Bulletin of Marine Science]] |date=October 1983 | volume=33 | issue=4 | pages=829–845}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to detect prey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Long-wave sensitivity in deep-sea stomiid dragonfish with far-red bioluminescence: evidence for a dietary origin of the chlorophyll-derived retinal photosensitizer of Malacosteus niger |author1=Douglas, RH |author2=Mullineaux, CW |author3=Partridge, JC | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |date=September 2000 | volume=355 | issue=1401 | pages=1269–1272 | pmc=1692851 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0681 | pmid=11079412}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for signalling.

===Countershading===
[[File:Adelie Penguin2.jpg|thumb|[[Adelie penguin]]s, ''Pygoscelis adeliae'', are white below and dark above.]]
{{main article|Countershading}}

Top/bottom countershading is common in fish including [[shark]]s, [[marlin]], and [[mackerel]], and animals in other groups such as dolphins, turtles and penguins. These animals have dark upper sides to match the ocean depths, and light undersides to avoid appearing dark against the bright sea surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rowland | first=Hannah M.  | jstor=40485817 | title=Abbott Thayer to the present day: what have we learned about the function of countershading?| journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] | year=2009 | volume=364 | pages=519–527 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0261 | pmid=19000972 | pmc=2674085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ruxton, Graeme D |author2=Speed, Michael P |author3=Kelly, David J | title=What, if anything, is the adaptive function of countershading?|journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] | year=2004 | volume=68 | pages=445–451 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.12.009| url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/biology/jbasil/documents/COUNTERSHADINGCLASS10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mimesis===
&lt;!--[[File:Leaf Scorpionfish in Kona.jpg|thumb|Leaf scorpionfish mimics vegetation swaying in a current.]]--&gt;
[[File:Juvenile rockmover in Kona.jpg|thumb|left|Juvenile rockmover, ''[[Novaculichthys taeniourus]]'', mimics algae]]
{{main article|Mimicry}}

Mimesis is practised by animals such as the [[leafy sea dragon]], ''Phycodurus eques'', and the [[Taenianotus triacanthus|leaf scorpionfish]], ''Taenianotus triacanthus'', which resemble parts of plants, and gently rock their bodies as if swayed by a current.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=341–342}}&lt;ref name="Leaf Scorpionfish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Leaf Scorpionfish |url=http://ocean.nationalgeographic.com/ocean/photos/undersea-camouflage/#camouflage07-leaf-scorpionfish_13513_600x450.jpg |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eight interesting facts about the Leaf Scorpionfish"&gt;{{cite web |title=Eight interesting facts about the Leaf Scorpionfish |url=http://www.daveharasti.com/articles/speciesspotlight/leafscorpionfish.htm |accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fish species ''[[Novaculichthys taeniourus]]'', the rockmover or dragon wrasse, there is a striking difference in appearance between the adults and the juveniles. A juvenile Rockmover resembles a loose piece of [[sea weed]]. It swims in a vertical position with its head pointing downwards, and behaves in a way that perfectly resembles the movement of a piece of seaweed: moving back and forth in the surge, as if it was inanimate.&lt;ref name="Rockmover Wrasse"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Dragon Wrasse: The Good, The Bad, and The Beautiful |url=http://www.fishchannel.com/fish-magazines/aquarium-fish-international/april-2011/dragon-wrasse.aspx |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-decoration===
[[File:Sea urchin decorated with shells.jpg|thumb|Self-decorated [[sea urchin]]]]

Self-decoration is employed by animals in different groups, including [[decorator crab]]s, which attach materials from their environment, as well as living organisms, to camouflage themselves. For example, the Japanese hermit crab, ''[[Eupagurus constans]]'', has the hydroid ''[[Hydractinia sodalis]]'' growing all over the shell that it lives in. Another hermit crab, ''[[Eupagurus cuanensis]]'', has the [[aposematic]] orange sponge ''[[Suberites domuncula]]'' which is bitter-tasting and not eaten by fish.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=361–362}}

Similarly, [[sea urchin]]s use their tube feet to pick up debris from the bottom and attach it to their upper surfaces. They use shells, rocks, algae and sometimes [[sea anemone]]s.&lt;ref name="Echinoderms"&gt;{{cite web | title=Echinoderms | url=http://www.starfish.ch/reef/echinoderms.html | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distraction===
[[File:Four-Eye Butterflyfish.jpg|thumb|Four-Eye Butterflyfish, ''[[Chaetodon capistratus]]'', showing its concealed eye and false eyespot near the tail]]

Many fish have eyespots near their tails, a form of [[automimicry]], to distract attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye. For example, ''[[Chaetodon capistratus]]'' has both a (disruptive) eyestripe to conceal the eye, and a large eyespot near its tail, giving the impression that the head is at the tail end of the body.{{sfn|Cott|1940|pages=372–374}}

===Disruption of outlines===
{{main article|Disruptive coloration}}

Fish such as ''[[Dascyllus aruanus]]'' have bold disruptive patterns on their sides, breaking up their outlines with strong contrasts. Fish like ''[[Heniochus macrolepidotus]]'' have similar bands of colour that extend into fins projecting far from the body, distracting attention from the true shape of the fish.{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=73}}

Some fish which mimic seaweeds such as the [[frogfish]]es ''[[Antennarius marmoratus]]'' and ''[[Pterophryne tumida]]'' have elaborate projections and spines which are combined with complex disruptive coloration. These have the effect of destroying the signature "fish" outline of these animals, as well as helping them to appear as pieces of algae.{{sfn|Cott|1940|page=341}}

===Adaptive coloration===
[[File:Octopus cyaneain Kona.jpg|thumb|The big blue octopus hunts by day, changing its colours and pattern to be cryptic or for signalling]]
{{further information|Active camouflage}}

A variety of marine animals possess [[active camouflage]] through their ability to change colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish such as the flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid similarly use colour change, in their case both for camouflage and signalling.&lt;ref name="Cephalopod dynamic camouflage"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hanlon, Roger |journal=Current Biology |volume=17 |issue=11 |title=Cephalopod dynamic camouflage |url=http://www.mbl.edu/pspb/files/2014/05/hanlon_currentbiol_2007.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011091531/http://www.mbl.edu/pspb/files/2014/05/hanlon_currentbiol_2007.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-10-11 |accessdate=2010-04-28 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.03.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[big blue octopus]], ''Octopus cyanea'', hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.&lt;ref name="DayOctopus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Day Octopuses, Octopus cyanea|url=http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=553|publisher=MarineBio|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peacock Flounder Bothus mancus in Kona.jpg |thumb |left |Four frames of a [[peacock flounder]] taken a few minutes apart]]

Like all flounders, [[Peacock flounder]]s, ''Bothus mancus'', have excellent adaptive camouflage. They use cryptic coloration to avoid being detected by both prey and predators. Whenever possible rather than swim, they crawl on their fins along the bottom while constantly changing colours and patterns to match their background. In a study, some flounders demonstrated the ability to change pattern in eight seconds. They were able to match the pattern of checkerboards that they were placed on. Changing pattern is an extremely complex process involving the flounder's vision and [[hormone]]s. If one of the fish's eyes is damaged, or covered by the sand, the flounder has difficulties in matching its pattern to its surroundings. Whenever the fish is hunting or hiding from predators, it buries itself into the sand, leaving only the eyes protruding.&lt;ref name="Camouflage under water"&gt;{{cite web | title=Camouflage under water | url=http://www.seafriends.org.nz/indepth/camouflage.htm | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The fisherman's ocean"&gt;{{cite book | title=The fisherman's ocean |author = Ross, David A | page=136 |year=2000 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hz9AWzpJydoC&amp;pg=PA136 |location=Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania |isbn=9780811727716 |publisher=[[Stackpole Books]] | accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peacock Flounder"&gt;{{cite web |title=Peacock Flounder |url=https://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/discover/species-profiles/bothus-lunatus |accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6430">The '''Unified Soil Classification System''' ('''USCS''') is a [[soil classification]] system used in [[engineering]] and [[geology]] to describe the [[Texture (geology)|texture]] and [[Particle size|grain size]] of a [[soil]]. The classification system can be applied to most [[unconsolidated]] materials, and is represented by a two-letter symbol. Each letter is described below (with the exception of '''Pt'''):

&lt;!-- Two tables side-by-side --&gt;

|}&lt;!-- End of tables --&gt;

If the soil has 5–12% by weight of fines passing a #200 sieve (5% &lt; P&lt;sub&gt;#200&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 12%), both grain size distribution and plasticity have a significant effect on the engineering properties of the soil, and dual notation may be used for the group symbol. For example, GW-GM corresponds to "well-graded gravel ''with silt''."

If the soil has more than 15% by weight retained on a #4 sieve (R&lt;sub&gt;#4&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 15%), there is a significant amount of gravel, and the suffix "with gravel" may be added to the group name, but the group symbol does not change. For example, SP-SM could refer to "poorly graded SAND with silt" or  "poorly graded SAND with silt and gravel."

'''Viral dynamics''' is a field of [[applied mathematics]] concerned with describing the progression of viral infections within a host organism.&lt;ref name="VDbook" &gt;{{cite book |last1=Nowak |first1=Martin |last2=May |first2=Robert |date=2001 |title=Virus Dynamics: mathematical principles of immunology and virology | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Kixhc3IiCy4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=virus+dynamics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9yXeVIHfH4a8yQTipIGYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=virus%20dynamics&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It employs a family of [[mathematical model]]s that describe changes over time in the populations of cells targeted by the virus and the [[viral load]]. These equations may also track competition between different viral strains and the influence of immune responses. The original viral dynamics models were inspired by compartmental [[epidemic model]]s (e.g. the SI model), with which they continue to share many common mathematical features, such as the concept of the [[basic reproduction number|basic reproductive ratio]] (''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). The major distinction between these fields is in the scale at which the models operate: while epidemiological models track the spread of infection between individuals within a population (i.e. "between host"), viral dynamics models track the spread of infection between cells within an individual (i.e. "within host"). Analyses employing viral dynamic models have been used extensively to study [[HIV]],&lt;ref name="VDbook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perelson|first1=Alan S|last2=Ribeiro|first2=Ruy M|title=Modeling the within-host dynamics of HIV infection|journal=BMC Biology|date=2013|volume=11|issue=1|page=96|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-11-96|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/11/96/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hepatitis B virus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowak|first1=MA|last2=Bonhoeffer|first2=S|last3=Hill|first3=AM|last4=Boehme|first4=R|last5=Thomas|first5=HC|last6=McDade|first6=H|title=Viral dynamics in hepatitis B virus infection|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=1996|volume=93|pages=4398–4402| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/93/9/4398.short|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.9.4398|pmc=39549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ciupe|first1=SM|last2=Ribeiro|first2=RM|last3=Nelson|first3=PW|last4=Perelson|first4=AS|title=Modeling the mechanisms of acute hepatitis B virus infection|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=2007|volume=247|issue=1|pages=23–35|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2007.02.017|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519307000938|pmc=1994818}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hepatitis C virus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neumann|first1=A|last2=Lam|first2=NP|last3=Dahari|first3=H|last4=Gretch|first4=DR|last5=Wiley|first5=TE|last6=Layden|first6=TJ|last7=Perelson|first7=AS|title=Hepatitis C Viral Dynamics in Vivo and the Antiviral Efficacy of Interferon-α Therapy|journal=Science|date=1998|volume=282|issue=5386|pages=103–107|doi=10.1126/science.282.5386.103|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/282/5386/103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chatterjee|first1=A|last2=Smith|first2=PF|last3=Perelson|first3=AS|title=Hepatitis C Viral Kinetics: The Past, Present, and Future|journal=Clinics in Liver Disease|date=2013|volume=17|issue=1|pages=13–26|doi=10.1016/j.cld.2012.09.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089326112000992|pmc=3584572}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other infections

{{InfoMaps}}
The '''visual language''' is a system of communication using visual elements. Speech as a means of communication cannot strictly be separated from the whole of human communicative activity which includes the visual&lt;ref&gt;Colin Cherry, On Human Communication, MIT, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; and the term 'language' in relation to vision is an extension of its use to describe the perception, comprehension and production of visible signs.

== Overview ==
An image which dramatizes and communicates an idea presupposes the use of a visual [[language]]. Just as people can 'verbalize' their thinking, they can 'visualize' it. A [[diagram]], a [[map]], and a [[painting]] are all examples of uses of visual language. Its structural units include line, shape, colour, form, motion, texture, pattern, direction, orientation, scale, angle, space and proportion.

The elements in an image represent concepts in a spatial context, rather than the linear form used for words. Speech and visual communication are parallel and often interdependent means by which humans exchange information.

== Visual language ==
Visual units in the form of lines and marks are constructed into meaningful shapes and structures or signs. Different areas of the cortex respond to different elements such as colour and form. [[Semir Zeki]]&lt;ref&gt;Semir Zeki, Inner Vision: an Exploration of Art and the Brain, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; has shown the responses in the brain to the paintings of [[Michelangelo]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]].

=== Imaging in the mind ===
What we have in our minds in a waking state and what we imagine in dreams is very much of the same nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hiller|first=Susan (ed.)|title=Dream Machines|year=2000|publisher=Hayward Gallery|location=London|isbn=1-85332-202-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dream images might be with or without spoken words, other sounds or colours. In the waking state there is usually, in the foreground, the buzz of immediate perception, feeling, mood and as well as fleeting memory images.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Gerald and Giulio Tononi, Consciousness: How Matter Becomes Imagination, 2000,Allen Lane,London {{ISBN|0-14-028147-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a mental state between dreaming and being fully awake is a state known as 'day dreaming' or a meditative state, during which "the things we see in the sky when the clouds are drifting, the centaurs and stags, antelopes and wolves" are projected from the imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, Ernst, Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation, 1960, Phaidon Press, London&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudolf Arnheim]]&lt;ref&gt;in Kepes, Gyorgy,ed., Sign, Image and Symbol,1966, Studio Vista, London&lt;/ref&gt; has attempted to answer the question: what does a mental image look like? In Greek philosophy, the School of Leucippus and Democritus believed that a replica of an object enters the eye and remains in the soul as a memory as a complete image. Berkeley explained that parts, for example, a leg rather than the complete body, can be brought visually to the mind. Arnheim considers the psychologist, [[Edward B. Titchener]]'s account to be the breakthrough in understanding something of how the vague incomplete quality of the image is 'impressionistic' and carries meaning as well as form.

=== Meaning and expression ===
[[Abstract art]] has shown that the qualities of line and shape, proportion and colour convey meaning directly without the use of words or pictorial representation. [[Wassily Kandinsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Wassily Kandinsky, Point and Line to Plane : Contribution to the Analysis of the Pictorial Elements, 1947, trans, Howard Deastyne and Hilla Rebay, Solomon Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; showed how drawn lines and marks can be expressive without any association with a representational image. From the most ancient cultures and throughout history visual language has been used to encode meaning: "The Bronze Age Badger Stone on Ilkly Moor is covered in circles, lines, hollow cups,winged figures, a spread hand, an ancient swastika, an embryo, a shooting star? … It's a story-telling rock, a message from a world before (written) words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyatt|first=Derek|date=Autumn 1995|title=To Strengthen the Tribe|journal=Modern Painters|volume=8|issue=3|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Gregory]] suggests that, "Perhaps the ability to respond to absent imaginary situations," as our early ancestors did with paintings on rock, "represents an essential step towards the development of abstract thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gregory|first=R. L.|authorlink=Richard Gregory|title=The Intelligent Eye|year=1970|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=0-297-00021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perception ===
The sense of sight operates selectively. [[Perception]] is not a passive recording of all that is in front of the eyes, but is a continuous judgement of scale and colour relationships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Itten|first=Johannes|authorlink=Johannes Itten|title=The Elements of Color: A Treatise on the '''Colour System''' of Johannes Itten Based on his Book "The Art of Colour"|year=1983|origyear=1970|others=trans. Ernst van Hagen|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|location=Wokingham|isbn=0-442-30581-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes making categories of forms to classify images and shapes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnheim|first=Rudolf|authorlink=Rudolf Arnheim|title=Visual Thinking|year=1970|publisher=Faber|location=London|isbn=0-571-09365-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children of six to twelve months are to be able through experience and learning to discriminate between circles, squares and triangles.The child from this age onwards learns to classify objects, abstracting essential qualities and comparing them to other similar objects. Before objects can be perceived and identified the child must be able to classify the different shapes and sizes that a single object may appear to have when it is seen in varying surroundings and from different aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon, M D, The Psychology of Perception, Penguin, London, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innate structures in the brain===
The perception of a shape requires the grasping of the essential structural features, to produce a "whole" or ''[[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]]''. The theory of the ''gestalt'' was proposed by [[Christian von Ehrenfels]] in 1890. He pointed out that a melody is still recognisable when played in different keys and argued that the whole is not simply the sum of its parts but a total structure. [[Max Wertheimer]] researched von Ehrenfels' idea, and in his "Theory of Form" (1923) – nicknamed "the dot essay" because it was illustrated with abstract patterns of dots and lines – he concluded that the perceiving eye tends to bring together elements that look alike (similarity groupings) and will complete an incomplete form (object hypothesis). An array of random dots tends to form configurations (constellations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Behrens|first=Roy R.|year=1998|title=Art, Design and Gestalt Theory|journal=Leonardo|volume=31|issue=4|pages=299–303|doi=10.2307/1576669|jstor=1576669|publisher=Leonardo, Vol. 31, No. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these innate abilities demonstrate how the eye and the mind are seeking pattern and simple whole shapes. When we look at more complex visual images such as paintings we can see that art has been a continuous attempt to "notate" visual information.

=== Visual thinking ===
{{main article|Visual thinking}}
Thought processes are diffused and interconnected and are cognitive at a sensory level. The mind thinks at its deepest level in sense material, and the two hemispheres of the brain deal with different kinds of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R Blakeslee, ''The right brain: a new understanding of the unconscious mind and its creative power'', Macmillan, London, 1980. {{ISBN|0-333-29090-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brain is divided into two hemispheres and a [[Corpus callosum|thick bundle of nerve fibres]] enable these two halves to communicate with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Roger W Sperry, Some effects of disconnecting the cerebral hemispheres, Nobel Lecture, Science 217, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gazzaniga, Tales from Both Sides of the Brain, Hopewell, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In most people the ability to organize and produce speech is predominantly located in the left side. Appreciating spatial perceptions depends more on the right hemisphere, although there is a left hemisphere contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solbaram.org/articles/humind.html|title=How the Human Brain Developed and How the Human Mind Works|last=Davidmann|first=Manfred|date=1998-04-20|work=Towards a Better Future: The Works of Manfred Davidmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to understand how designers solve problems, [[L. Bruce Archer]] proposed "that the way designers (and everybody else, for that matter) form images in their [[mind's eye]], manipulating and evaluating ideas before, during and after externalising them, constitutes a cognitive system comparable with but different from, the verbal language system. Indeed we believe that human beings have an innate capacity for cognitive modelling, and its expression through sketching, drawing, construction, acting out and so on, that is fundamental to human thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Archer|first=L. Bruce|authorlink=L. Bruce Archer|year=1979|title=Whatever Became of Design Methodology?|journal=Design Studies|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–18|doi=10.1016/0142-694X(79)90023-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art in education===
The visual language begins to develop in babies as the eye and brain become able to focus, and be able to recognize patterns. Children's drawings show a process of increasing perceptual awareness and range of elements to express personal experience and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Betty Edwards, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain, Tarcher, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the visual aspect of language communication in education has been referred to as [[graphicacy]],&lt;ref&gt;Visual Education, Schools Council, York, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; as a parallel discipline to literacy and numeracy. The ability to think and communicate in visual terms is part of, and of equal importance in the learning process, with that of literacy and numeracy. The visual artist, as [[Michael Twyman]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Twyman, Graphic Images in Relation to Learning, Typography Unit, Reading University, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; has pointed out, has developed the ability to handle the visual language to communicate ideas. This includes both the understanding and conception and the production of concepts in a visual form.

'''Wikiprogress''' is an online platform for sharing information on the measurement of social, economic and environmental [[Progress (history)|progress]]. It is thought to facilitate sharing on ideas, initiatives and knowledge on "measuring the progress of societies". It is, like Wikipedia, open to all members and communities for contribution – anyone interested in "progress" can register.

==About==
Wikiprogress is the official platform for the [[OECD]]-hosted [http://www.wikiprogress.org/index.php/Global_Project Global Project on "Measuring the Progress of Societies".] The core mission of wikiprogress is "to create global information tool supported by a worldwide partnership of organisations and individuals wishing to develop new, smarter measures of progress. Wikiprogress aims to provide a health check for all societies that enables every citizen to better understand the economic, social and environmental factors that determine whether or not their lives are getting better." 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikiprogress.org/about-wikiprogress/|title=About Wikiprogress|work=Wikiprogress}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is not just to develop progress indicators, but creating a community working together to determine what and how we measure the well-being of societies. Such decisions can not be taken by a single organisation or NSO, but by individuals, governments, and organisations all over the world.

The Global Project is closely linked to the Istanbul Declaration signed at the [http://www.oecd.org/document/51/0,3746,en_21571361_31938349_37115187_1_1_1_1,00.html 2nd OECD World Forum on "Measuring and Fostering the Progress of Societies"] in 2007. The [http://www.oecd.org/document/23/0,3746,en_21571361_31938349_39161687_1_1_1_1,00.html Istanbul Declaration] was signed by organisations such as the [[European Commission]], OECD, Organisation of the Islamic conference, [[United Nations]], [[United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP), and the [[World Bank]]. The Declaration was also signed by AFRISTAT, [[EFTA]], [[International Labour Office]] (ILO), [[UNESCO]], [[UNICEF]], and the United Nations University - Comparative Regional Integration Studies. Furthermore, many high-ranking individuals also signed the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/23/0,3746,en_21571361_31938349_39161687_1_1_1_1,00.html|title=People and Organisations who signed the Istanbul Declaration|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wikiprogress was presented in beta in 2009 at the OECD World Forum on Statistics, Knowledge and Policy in Busan, Korea.
The wikiprogress platform also hosts the [http://www.wikiprogress.org/index.php/Child_well-being wikichild], a wiki dedicated to child well-being. Child well-being can be considered an important part of a society's well-being into the future. Their well-being is key to the sustainability of our societies.

The project has an important and growing number of [http://www.wikiprogress.org/index.php/Correspondents correspondents] that support and contribute to the network.

The [[OECD]] hosts a world forum every two or three years in co-operation with a selected host country. The 4th OECD World Forum will be held in India in 2012.
