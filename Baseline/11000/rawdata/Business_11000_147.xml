      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2467">'''Akberali Moawalla''' is a prominent businessman, notable for his business connections to the [[Bin Laden family]] of [[Saudi Arabia]]. He is a former business partner of [[Yeslam bin Ladin]], half-brother of the more famous [[Osama bin Laden]], and of the Geneva-based [[Saudi Investment Company]] (SICO), which represents the worldwide business interests of the [[Saudi Binladin Group]].

== Interesting transactions ==
On December 5, 2001, French authorities opened an investigation into financial transfers executed in Paris between firms under SICO's umbrella, which also aroused the interest of investigative authorities in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, the chief investigator noted a €241 million transfer made to Pakistan in 2000 from an account belonging to an SBG subsidiary company called Cambridge, which was opened at [[Deutsche Bank]] in Geneva, according to ''[[Le Monde]]''.  {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} U.S. authorities were aware of the existence of those funds, which they believe were transferred into an account belonging jointly to Osama bin Laden and someone of Pakistani nationality, according to the French paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{For|the Russian footballer|Anatoli Demidov}}
[[Image:1831. Anatole Demidov.jpg|thumb|right|Anatole Demidov by [[Karl Briullov|Karl Brulloff]], 1831, Florence, [[Palazzo Pitti]]]]
[[File:Demidov herb.jpg|thumb|Arms as [[Prince of San Donato]]]]
'''Count Anatoly Nikolaievich Demidov, 1st Prince of [[Villa San Donato|San Donato]]''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Анатолий Николаевич Демидов}}; 5 April OS: 24 March 1813 &amp;ndash; 29 April 1870) was a Russian industrialist, diplomat and arts patron of the [[Demidov]] family.

==Life==

===Early life===
Born in [[Saint Petersburg]] or [[Moscow]], he was the second surviving son of Count [[Nikolai Nikitich Demidov]] and Baroness [[Elisabeta Alexandrovna Stroganova]]. He grew up in Paris, where his father was ambassador. He served briefly as a diplomat himself in Paris (living in the hôtel built by [[Charles de Wailly]] for the sculptor [[Augustin Pajou]], at 87 [[rue de la Pépinière]], now the [[rue La Boétie]]), Rome and [[Venice]]. Upon his father's death in 1828, Anatole settled for good in western Europe, returning to Russia as little as possible. This attitude alienated him from tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]], who always had an antipathy towards him.

===Scholarly endeavours===
In 1837–38, he organised a scientific expedition of 22 scholars, writers and artists (of which [[Auguste Raffet]] and the critic [[Jules Janin]] became Demidov's friends) to southern Russia and the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]], headed up by [[Frédéric Le Play]]. It cost 500,000 francs and its results were published as ''Voyage dans la Russie méridionale et la Crimée'' (4 vol., 1840–1842), with 100 original lithographs by [[Auguste Raffet|Raffet]] and dedicated to the tsar despite his not having taken any interest in the book (irritated as he was that most of the expedition's members had been French). Demidov also financed a trip to Russia by [[André Durand]] to relieve the peasants, the results of which were published as ''Voyage pittoresque et archéologique en Russie'' (1839).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shapero.com/images/Image/PDF/50FineBooks.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411094713/http://www.shapero.com/images/Image/PDF/50FineBooks.pdf |archive-date=2009-04-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, Demidov himself published a series of articles on Russia in the ''[[Journal des Débats]]'' – these were collected as ''Lettres sur l’Empire de Russie'' (1840) with the aim of fighting certain received French ideas about Russia. Nevertheless, these works irritated Nicholas I due to their description of Russia's feudal system. In 1847 Demidov made a trip to Spain with Raffet, publishing an account of it later as ''Etapes maritimes sur les côtes d’Espagne'' (1858). In 1842, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

===Art collector===
[[File:Anatol Demidov by Jeanne-Mathilde Herbelin.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Anatol Demidov by [[Jeanne-Mathilde Herbelin]]]]
[[Image:La princesse Mathilde (1820-1904) par Dubufe en 1861.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Mathilde-Létizia Bonaparte|Mathilde Bonaparte]]]]

He also considerably expanded the [[Demidov collection]] assembled by his father at the [[Villa San Donato]] near [[Florence]], being particularly interested in [[Romanticism|Romantic art]]. In the [[Paris Salon]] of 1834 he acquired [[Paul Delaroche]]'s ''[[The Execution of Lady Jane Grey]]'' (now in the [[National Gallery, London]]). In 1833, he bought [[François Marius Granet]]'s ''The Death of Poussin'', which caused a sensation at the 1834 Salon. He commissioned paintings from [[Eugène Delacroix]] and watercolours from [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] and [[Théodore Géricault]], as well as Briullov's ''[[The Last Day of Pompeii]]''. His collection was split up in public sales in Paris in 1863 and shortly before the prince's death in 1870.

===Marriage and separation===
Like his parents, Demidov was a great admirer of [[Napoleon I of France]]. He built a museum below the house of San Martino on [[Isle of Elba|Elba]], where Napoleon had lived during his first exile, and he caused a mass to be sung at [[Portoferraio]] every 5th of May (which is still sung today). In 1839, he was introduced by [[Jules Janin]] into the circle of [[Jérôme Bonaparte]], former king of Westphalia, who was living in exile at the [[Villa di Quarto]] in [[Florence]]. A plan to marry Jérôme's daughter princess [[Mathilde-Létizia Bonaparte]] to Demidov was quickly formed. It was agreed that she would receive a dowry of 50,000 francs in jewels (bought by Demidov for 1 million francs from Jérôme, always short of money) and 240,000 francs in money, payable in instalments. A decree of 20 October 1840 also made Demidov the [[Prince of San Donato]] to allow the princess to hold onto her title, though Demidov's princely title was never recognised in Russia. The marriage took place in [[Rome]] or [[Florence]] on 1 November 1840.

In March 1841, the couple went to Saint Petersburg, where the Tsar was full of attention for his cousin (through the Württembergs) the princess and losing no opportunity to humiliate Demidov by any means possible. In spite of this, Anatole began his own infidelities. On 17 August 1841, the couple arrived in Paris, where they lived at hôtel Demidoff at 109 [[rue Saint-Dominique]] until June 1842, when they moved to spend a year in Saint Petersburg before finally setting up home at the Villa San Donato. Their relationship soon soured, with the princess taking Count [[Émilien de Nieuwerkerke]] as a lover, and Demidov taking [[Valentine de Sainte-Aldegonde]], duchesse de Dino, as a mistress.

Mathilde made a violent scene with Valentine during a ball and in reply Demidov slapped her twice in public. Separated since 1843, in September 1846 Mathilde fled to Paris to take refuge with Nieuwerkerke, taking with her the jewels from her dowry. Even so, Demidov was condemned by a tribunal in Saint Petersburg to send Mathilde an annual pension of 200,000 francs and was never able to recover his jewels. In many ways, Demidov felt he deserved such punishment, and their separation was authorised in 1847 by a personal decision of tsar Nicholas I. Demidov's many other mistresses included [[Maria Calergis]], considered one of the most beautiful women of her era, [[Ernestine Duverger]], and Fanny de la Rochefoucauld (daughter of [[François XIII de La Rochefoucauld|Francois]], 8th duc de la Rochefoucauld, with whom he had an illegitimate son).

===Later life===
Demidov tried to repair the damage the separation had done to his social standing by increasing his charitable donations. He created hospitals, orphanages and started an international committee to aid prisoners of the [[Crimean War]], as well as giving 1 million roubles to finance that war (for which [[Alexander II of Russia]] made him chamberlain and councillor of state). In 1860, he, the [[Charles Auguste Louis Joseph, duc de Morny|duc de Morny]] and doctor Oliffe made up the consortium of investors which founded the bathing resort at [[Deauville]], and he took part in the famous [[Carnival de Paris]] (a painting at the [[musée Carnavalet]] shows his team taking part).

A bon viveur, two chicken dishes were named after him, including Chicken Demidoff (elaborately stuffed, smothered, tied up and garnished), and the Demidoff name is also applied to dishes of rissoles and red snapper. He died in 1870 of a pulmonary congestion in his hotel on rue Saint-Dominique in Paris. Dying without legitimate issue, his title of Prince of San Donato passed to his nephew [[Pavel Pavlovitch Demidov]].

'''Bizzarrini S.p.A.''' was an Italian [[Automobile|automotive]] [[Manufacturing|manufacturer]] in the 1960s founded by former [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Ferrari]] and [[Iso (automobile)|Iso]] engineer [[Giotto Bizzarrini]]. The company built a small number of highly developed and advanced sport and racing automobiles before failing in 1969. Notable models include the [[Bizzarrini Strada|5300 GT Strada]] and the [[Bizzarrini P538|P538S]].

Originally Prototipi Bizzarrini s.r.l., the name was changed to Bizzarrini S.p.A. in 1966. The Bizzarrini marque has been revived with a number of [[concept car]]s in the 2000s.

==Giotto Bizzarrini==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
{{Main|Giotto Bizzarrini}}
[[Giotto Bizzarrini]] was born in [[Livorno]], Italy in 1926. His father was a rich landowner who came from a family with strong roots in Tuscany and the city of Livorno. His grandfather, also named Giotto Bizzarrini, was a biologist who had worked with [[Guglielmo Marconi]] on his inventions, especially the radio, following which one of the Livorno Library sections was named The Bizzarrini Library.
[[File:SC06 Ferrari 195 Inter 250 GT California Spyder and 250 GT Boano.jpg|right|thumb|1959 GT Boano]]
Bizzarrini graduated as an engineer in the [[University of Pisa]] in 1953. He taught briefly before joining Alfa Romeo in 1954. He worked for [[Alfa Romeo]] from 1954 to 1957. He began working for [[Ferrari]] in 1957, eventually becoming controller of experimental, Sports and GT car development. He worked at Ferrari as a developer, designer, test driver, and chief engineer for five years. His developments there included  the [[Ferrari TR|Ferrari 250 TR]], the [[Ferrari 250|Ferrari 250 GT]] SWB (''Short Wheelbase Berlinetta or Berlinetta Passo Corto''), and the 1962 [[Ferrari 250 GTO]].

Bizzarrini was fired by Ferrari during the [[History of Ferrari#1961 - The great walkout|"palace revolt" of 1961]]. He became part of [[Automobili Turismo e Sport]] (ATS)), a company started by the ex-Ferrari engineers to build a Formula 1 single seater and a GT sport car, the A.T.S. Serenissima.

One of ATS's financial backers, Count [[Giovanni Volpi]], owner of [[Scuderia Serenissima]], hired Bizzarrini to upgrade a Ferrari 250 GT SWB, with chassis number #2819GT to GTO specifications. This resulted in the [[Ferrari 250 GT SWB Breadvan|Ferrari 250 GT SWB Drogo]] also known as the "Breadvan".

Bizzarrini's engineering company, Societa Autostar, was commissioned to design a V-12 engine for a GT car to be built by another dissatisfied Ferrari customer, [[Ferruccio Lamborghini]]. Lamborghini considered the resulting engine to be too highly strung, and ordered that it be detuned.

==Iso Rivolta==
[[File:Iso Rivolta IR 300 GT.jpg|thumb|right|1967 Iso Rivolta IR 300 GT Coupe]]
[[File:Bizzarrini Iso Grifo 5300 Corsa.jpg|thumb|right|1964 Bizzarrini Iso Grifo Berlinetta 5300 Corsa (Grifo AC3 body and Corvette {{convert|327|cuin|cc|abbr=on}} engine).]]

Bizzarrini worked since 1964 for [[Iso (automobile)|Iso Rivolta]] and developed three models: Iso Rivolta GT, [[Iso Grifo]] both A3L and A3C versions. His work was to develop a pressed steel frame chassis for Iso cars. Renzo Rivolta hired him as consultant to the Iso Gordon GT project which became the Iso Rivolta GT. The Iso Gordon GT prototype was developed from the [[Gordon-Keeble]]. The Gordon Keeble GT was designed in 1960 by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. Bizzarrini tested the car and was impressed by the powerful V8 Corvette engine and the rear [[De Dion tube]] suspension used for the GT:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Rivolta had me test the prototype. I liked its De Dion tube and especially the Corvette engine. It was the first time I had driven one. It was superior to Ferrari's engines, having the same power, but with a more immediate throttle response."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Iso Rivolta GT was a Giugiaro-designed four-seater with beautiful body, speed, comfort and handling, and was a successful car for Iso, with 799 units sold. Powered by a 327&amp;nbsp;in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (5.36&amp;nbsp;L) Chevrolet Corvette V8 engine with a classic De Dion rear suspension design with pressed steel monocoque bodywork over pressed steel frame chassis. Unveiled to the press in 1963, production continued until 1970.
[[File:Iso Grifo Rear.JPG|left|thumb|Iso Grifo Series I, rear view]]

===Iso Grifo===
The [[Iso Grifo|Iso Grifo A3L]] was a monstrous idea for a super coupé, the L coming from ''Lusso''. The result of the brilliant Giugiaro and Bizzarrini working together, it was based on a shortened Iso Rivolta GT chassis and was debuted at the 1963 Turin show. The Grifo epitomised the 1960s Italian style with its handsome low and wide handmade bodywork. It was the fastest production car tested by [[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar Magazine]] in 1966 with a top speed of {{convert|160|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Later versions of the Grifo were powered by a big block [[Chevrolet Corvette]] {{convert|435|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} engine. These 90 handbuilt units are distinguishable by the raised "pagoda style" scoop bonnet. Some of these [[Iso Grifo|Iso Grifo 7 Litri]] units were rebuilt later with even bigger engines.

The idea of Bizzarrini was to use the 3AL cars for competition. The competition versions of the Grifo were named Iso Grifo A3C, C for Competizione or Corsa. A new lightweight riveted aluminium body was designed and built by [[Piero Drogo]]. It was an aggressively-designed machine, oriented to endurance races. It uses normal Iso underpinnings but the engine was moved further back in the chassis frame than the Grifo A3L, protruding well into the driver's cabin, fitted with hot cams and fed by four big [[Weber carburetor]]s, giving more than {{convert|400|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.

Around 29 A3C sport cars were built under the Iso name. Five of these 29 cars were bodied in plastic/fiberglass by Piero Drogo at [[Carrozzeria Sports Cars]] in [[Modena]]. A3Cs were widely raced. Some cars entered the 1964 and 1965 [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans 24 hour]], 1965 [[Nürburgring]] 1000 and 1965 [[12 Hours of Sebring|Sebring]]. It achieved a Le Mans class win in both years and a 9th overall in [[1965 24 Hours of Le Mans|1965]] with no factory support. A3Cs were one of the fastest cars on Le Mans' [[Mulsanne Straight]] in both years.

==Bizzarrini S.p. A==
Due to the complicated deal with Iso, Bizzarrini left in 1964 and founded Societa Prototipi Bizzarrini (Bizzarrini S.p. A), which produced some 140 cars through 1969 at its [[Livorno]] factory.

===Racing===
Giotto Bizzarrini was a dedicated race car designer and builder. Likely one of the sources of disagreement between Renzo Rivolta and Giotto Bizzarrini was Bizzarrini’s desire to build race cars and Renzo Rivolta’s desire to build high quality GT cars and family transportation cars. They decided to part ways in 1964.

Bizzarrini had mixed success in racing. The lowlight for Bizzarrini must certainly have been the Sebring 12 Hours on March 27, 1965 where both Iso/Bizzarrini race cars were heavily crashed and totaled.

The highlight came later that same year at the 24 Hours of Le Mans on June 19–20, 1965 where an Iso Grifo/Bizzarrini won the 5000&amp;nbsp;cc and over class and was ninth overall.

;Sebring 12 Hours 1965
C. Rino Argento helped Bizzarrini manage the race cars during that terrible week in June 1965 at Sebring. He has written a detailed account of that week, which was originally published in the Griffon, the magazine of the Iso &amp; Bizzarrini Owner’s Club.&lt;ref name="mycarquest.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mycarquest.com/2013/04/two-crashed-iso-grifobizzarrini-race-cars-are-still-missing-sebring-12-hours-1965-part-1.html|title=Two Crashed Iso Grifo/Bizzarrini Race Cars Are Still Missing - Sebring 12 Hours 1965 - Part 1|work=mycarquest.com|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Car No. 8, driven by Silvio Moser, went off track due to brake failure and crashed into a Volkswagen bus. Nobody was injured, but the car was a total loss.

Later during a very heavy rain storm car No. 9, driven by Mike Gammino, aquaplaned, hit the pedestrian bridge and split in two. The car split right behind the driver and Mike Gammino did not realize how close he came to being killed until he stepped out of the car.

The famous California race car builder Max Balchowsky was also at Sebring helping the Bizzarrini team. He took all of the pieces of these two Iso/Bizzarrini race cars back to his shop in Southern California with the intention to build one Iso/Bizzarrini from the pieces of the two destroyed cars. This recreated Iso/Bizzarrini race car has never been seen again.

There was a morbid end to the week: a plane crash killed Iso and Bizzarrini supporter Mitch Michelmore and his son as they were on their way back to California. Michelmore "had a Chevrolet dealership in Reseda, California and he had sold quite a few Iso Rivoltas; he was enthusiastic about the cars and interested in the racing version (the Grifos) and was seriously considering a sales activity for them in this country", according to C. Rino Argento.

Argento summed up the week: “This was the end of a terrible week and the pain was unbearable for me, the organizer of this adventure! In great part because of my initiative and planning all these people had congregated at Sebring for what was supposed to be a fun, interesting, successful, and profitable race and it turned out to be a human and material disaster!”&lt;ref name="mycarquest.com" /&gt;

===5300 Strada===
{{Main|Bizzarrini Strada}}
In 1966 Bizzarrini S.p.A. released a stunning street legal Grifo A3C as the ''[[Bizzarrini Strada|Bizzarrini 5300 GT Strada]]'' (or ''Bizzarrini 5300 GT America'', depending on the market). The body shape and mechanical parts were the much the same as the Iso A3Cs, resulting in a power-packed yet sensuous coupe that is 43" in height.&lt;ref name="arcadiadreams"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcadiadreams.com/images/ad_automobili/Bizzarrini_5300GT_1969.jpg|date=4 June 2004|title=Image: Bizzarrini_5300GT_1969.jpg, (800 × 638 px)|publisher=arcadiadreams.com|access-date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bizzarrini GT 5300 No. 0256.jpg|thumb|1966 Bizzarrini GT 5300 Chassis No. 0256]]

At least three 5300s were turned out as Style Italia-designed spyder/targa versions, all of which survive and are currently owned by the same person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mycarquest.com/2012/07/the-three-bizzarrini-spyders-are-a-big-hit-in-the-poconos.html|title=The Three Bizzarrini Spyders Were A Big Hit In The Poconos!|work=mycarquest.com|access-date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1900 GT Europa===
{{Main|Bizzarrini Europa}}
Bizzarrini also managed a scaled-down 5300 GT project. Designed for GM-Opel, it was based on Opel 1900 platform. Bizzarrini's proposal was more aggressive and attractive in appearance, like a small 5300 GT. The production [[Opel GT]] was designed by factory stylists and was less aggressive, but still beautiful. Bizzarrini then decided to build the car on his own. Around 17 prototypes were completed. The car is officially named as the Bizzarrini 1900 GT Europa. One of these cars has a ''[[barchetta]]'' ("little boat") body. Some cars are powered by 1300-litre and 1600-litre four-cylinder engines sourced from General Motors, Alfa Romeo and [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]]. There is even a highly developed racing version with a [[SPICA]] fuel injection system.

===P538S===
{{Main|Bizzarrini P538}}
[[File:SC06 1967 Bizzarrini P538.jpg|right|thumb|1967 [[Bizzarrini P538]]]]
[[File:Bizzarrini Manta Front.jpg|thumb|right|The custom-built Bizzarrini Manta]]
Bizzarrini's advanced ideas emerged again with the superb [[Bizzarrini P538S]], ''P'' for posteriore, ''53'' for the 5300 cc Corvette engine, ''8'' for V8 engine and ''S'' for Sportcar. The first V-12 car was ordered by American racer [[Mike Gammino]].

This ultra low barchetta raced in the 1966 Le Mans (DNF) and was even entered in 1967, but did not start (DNQ). In 1966, after a spin at the start line, it lasted less than a half an hour and retired due to a cracked oil line. During the short race time, the P538 was clocked as one of the fastest cars on the Mulsanne Straight.

In 1968, Giugiaro rebuilt one of the P538 bodies as the famous [[Bizzarrini Manta]]. After some years in [[Sweden]], it was dismantled for an extensive restoration. Later featured in various classics car events, it is now in the United States.

==Post Bizzarrini S.p. A==
===AMX/3===
Seven complete AMX/3 cars and nine chassis are known to survive. Bizzarrini used the 8th AMX/3 chassis to build the Iso Varedo. The 9th chassis was used to build the AMX Spider. This was the ultimate evolution of the P538 chassis.

===P538S===
Officially, three or four chassis were originally built in period, destined to race in the United States by Mike Gammino and Le Mans. Today, not less than a dozen (or more) chassis are in existence, some of these replicas claiming to be the real cars raced in Le Mans. At least two of the replicas are [[Lamborghini]] V12 powered. These V12 powered cars were truly the long-awaited Bizzarrini dream&amp;nbsp;— his own engine and chassis.

===BZ-2001===
In 1990, Bizzarrini was involved in the design of a one-off supercar model. Based on [[Ferrari Testarossa]] components, Bizzarrini and his team designed a superb car. The Bizzarrini BZ-2001 is the true successor of the P538. The car was the first one of a planned production run, but only one more car was completed.

===Picchio Barchetta===
In 1989 a group of young friends living in Ascoli Piceno, with a strong passion for motor sport, had the idea to establish a company constructing "copies" of the cars manufactured in the past by Giotto Bizzarrini. During their first encounter, the Tuscan motor genius expressed a kind of animosity towards this idea; he refused to support the project and he turned the group of friends out. Nevertheless, their motivation was so strong that, after a short briefing of about half an hour, they presented an alternative proposal&amp;nbsp;— to construct a sports car. The result was the [[Picchio Racing Cars|Picchio Barchetta]], powered by [[BMW]] engines. The cars were successfully raced in the [[Italian Hillclimb Championship]] and [[Italian Sport Championship]].

===Kjara===
[[File:kjara.jpg|right|thumb|1998 [[Bizzarrini Kjara]]]]
The Kjara project was born in 1998. The Scuderia Bizzarrini built this sport barchetta in close collaboration with Leone Martellucci of University La Sapienza of Roma. The car is powered by a parallel hybrid propulsion system with a 2.5 litre TurboDiesel [[Lancia]] engine and a {{convert|40|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} AC electric drive; it was shown at [[Turin Auto Show]] 2000.

==Bizzarrini today==
Mr. Bizzarrini is still busy with personal projects and conferences.

At the 2005 Geneva show, the new owner of the marque Bizzarrini showed the new [[GT Strada 4.1 concept]], a two-door GT with a 4.1-litre {{convert|550|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} plant, producing a maximum speed {{convert|360|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}, 0–100&amp;nbsp;km/h in 3.8&amp;nbsp;seconds, and was planned for production in 2007.

Since 2008, Giotto Bizzarrini has been working in Livorno, building replicas P538 for American customers.

Today, he is still very busy, teaching and collaborating with the Roma University developing advanced projects and designing, building and developing his own sport cars. He often said: "I'm not a car designer, I am a worker".

On October 23, 2012, the occasion of the inauguration of the University of Florence new Design Campus in Calenzano, Professor Giotto Bizzarrini was given the Honoris Causa Degree in Industrial Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mycarquest.com/2012/10/giotto-bizzarrini-receives-an-honorary-doctorate-from-the-university-of-florence-italy.html|title=Giotto Bizzarrini Receives An Honorary Doctorate From the University of Florence (Italy)|work=mycarquest.com|access-date=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}

A '''bonus clause''' is a clause in a contract that rewards the contractor for doing more than the letter of the contract; particularly, to finish the job early. It is in apposition to a [[Penal damages|penalty clause]] where the contractor loses by providing less than the letter of the contract, or providing it later than agreed.

The aim of a bonus clause is to give a [[win-win situation]] whereby the contractor wins by getting more money for finishing early, and the holder of the contract wins by having a product earlier to market.

'''BrowserChoice.eu''' was a [[website]] created by [[Microsoft]] in March 2010 following a decision in the [[European Union Microsoft competition case]]. The case involved legal proceedings by the [[European Union]] against Microsoft and found that, by including [[Internet Explorer]] with their market-dominant [[Microsoft Windows|Windows operating system]], Microsoft had used this dominance to create a similar market position in the [[web browser]] market. The BrowserChoice.eu website was created to allow users that had not made, or were unaware of, a choice to try other browsers, and thus comply with the [[European Commission]]'s ruling.

However, Microsoft's obligation to display the Browser Choice screen to Windows users expired in December 2014.&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/12/windows-browser-ballot-comes-to-an-end-as-ec-obligation-expires |title=Windows Browser Ballot comes to an end as EC obligation expires |last=Bright |first=Peter |date=18 December 2014 |work=Ars Technica |publisher=Condé Nast |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BrowserChoice.eu website was discontinued as early as the next year, showing a notice advising users to "[visit] the websites of web browser vendors directly," before going offline completely.&lt;ref name="website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=18 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208004146/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archivedate=8 February 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2018|November}}, the site is still offline.

==Web browser choice screen==
The ''web browser choice screen'', also known as the ''web browser ballot box'', was a screen displayed in [[Internet Explorer]] that offered ten to twelve browsers in a random order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_on_the_issues/archive/2010/02/19/the-browser-choice-screen-for-europe-what-to-expect-when-to-expect-it.aspx |title=The Browser Choice Screen for Europe: What to Expect, When to Expect It |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |last=Heiner |first=Dave |date=19 February 2010 |accessdate=24 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The screen was presented only to Windows users whose default web browser is Internet Explorer. It affected the [[European Economic Area]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2009/dec09/12-16Statement.mspx |title=Microsoft Statement on European Commission Decision |publisher=Microsoft |date=16 December 2009 |accessdate=14 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217083729/http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2009/dec09/12-16Statement.mspx# |archive-date=17 December 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Croatia]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/ff606439.aspx |title=Browser Choice FAQ |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2013-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patch was made available via [[Windows Update]] to provide the screen to users. It was displayed to anyone who had not chosen another browser as their default browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Microsoft-liefert-Web-Browser-Auswahlfenster-ab-17-Maerz-aus-935566.html |title=Microsoft liefert Web-Browser-Auswahlfenster ab 17.

==Browsers listed==
The browser choice screen listed 10 to 12 browsers in random order; the top tier of five were immediately visible and the remaining ones could be seen by scrolling the list. The order of the browsers on the page was initially planned to be alphabetical, but after criticism a random system was used with two groups.

The first group included the five most used browsers ‒ [[Internet Explorer]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Google Chrome]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and initially [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] but later [[Maxthon]] ‒ representing the four major rendering engines ([[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]], [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]], [[Blink (layout engine)|Blink]] and [[WebKit]]). The second group contained less well-known browsers, also in random order: at different times this group included [[Avant Browser]], [[Comodo Dragon (web browser)|Comodo Dragon]], [[Flock (web browser)|Flock]], [[GreenBrowser]], [[K-Meleon]], [[Lunascape (web browser)|Lunascape]], [[Maxthon]], [[Rockmelt]], [[SRWare Iron]], [[Sleipnir (web browser)|Sleipnir]], and [[SlimBrowser]].

The initial March 2010 list had [[Internet Explorer]], [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]], [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] in the first tier, with [[Avant Browser]], [[Flock (web browser)|Flock]], [[GreenBrowser]], [[K-Meleon]], [[Maxthon]], [[Sleipnir (web browser)|Sleipnir]] and [[SlimBrowser]] in the second tier.

In August 2010 Microsoft removed GreenBrowser and Sleipnir from the choices, replacing them with [[Lunascape (web browser)|Lunascape]] and [[SRWare Iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822062000/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=22 August 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828094328/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=28 August 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011 Microsoft reduced the number of second tier browsers from the previous seven to six. They removed Flock and SlimBrowser, but re-established Sleipnir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103214224/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=3 November 2011 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012 Microsoft increased the number of second tier browsers to seven: [[Comodo Dragon (web browser)|Comodo Dragon]] and [[Rockmelt]] were added, while Sleipnir was removed again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224114437/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=24 February 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012 Microsoft removed Apple Safari from the first tier due to the browser's discontinuation on Windows, and replaced it with Maxthon. SlimBrowser was added back to the second tier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919182030/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=19 September 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013 Microsoft removed SlimBrowser from the second tier and replaced it with Sleipnir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226201610/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=26 February 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 Microsoft removed Rockmelt from the second tier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |accessdate=30 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530112827/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archivedate=30 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2014 Microsoft had removed Comodo Dragon from the second tier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |accessdate=18 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516183141/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archivedate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014 Comodo was returned to the second tier, replacing Avant Browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |accessdate=18 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903235102/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archivedate=3 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 the website was discontinued and no longer lists any browsers.&lt;ref name="ars" /&gt;&lt;ref name="website" /&gt;

==Results==
Competing browsers saw their traffic increase,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/08/technology/08browser.html |title=Microsoft Gives Rival Browsers a Lift |last=Pfanner |first=Eric |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=7 March 2010 |accessdate=7 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that these smaller competing developers were gaining users. However, long-term trends show browsers such as Opera and Firefox losing market share in Europe, calling into question the usefulness of the browser choice screen.&lt;ref name="ars" /&gt;

==Criticism==
The source code of the page itself came under criticism. The order of the browsers on screen was at first insufficiently random, which led to uneven distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/22/microsoft-ballot-screen |title=How Random Is Microsoft's Random Browser Choice Screen In Europe? |publisher=TechCrunch |last=Wauters |first=Robin |date=22 February 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/03/coding-error-leads-to-uneven-eu-browser-ballot-distribution |title=Coding error leads to uneven EU browser ballot distribution |publisher=Ars Technica |last=Bright |first=Peter |date=2 March 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later fixed by Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/09/microsoft_browser_ballot_update |title=Microsoft rejiggers EU browser ballot after complaints |publisher=[[The Register]] |last=Metz |first=Cade |date=9 March 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of browsers was also criticised.&lt;ref name="bbcLimited"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8545237.stm |title=Microsoft browser ballot criticised for being 'limited' |publisher=BBC |last=Ward |first=Mark |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its inception, half of the suggested browsers use Internet Explorer's [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]] rendering engine, thus users who choose web browsers other than Internet Explorer for the intention of avoiding it might still end up using IE's layout engine.&lt;ref name="bbcLimited" /&gt; This has resulted in criticism amongst the web development community even though Microsoft was adhering to the court agreement's methodology.&lt;ref name="bbcLimited" /&gt;

Finally, the overall ability for users to access the site was criticised. [[Opera Software]] complained that the ballot screen could not be reached in some cases because of the start configuration screens of IE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/04/03/windows_ie_browser_ballot_screen |title=Opera alerts EU to hidden Windows browser-ballot |last=Clarke |first=Gavin |date=3 April 2010 |publisher=[[The Register]] |accessdate=8 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Microsoft had issues with both Windows 7 and Windows 8 no longer leading new users in the [[European Union]] to the page. The [[Windows7#Service Pack 1|Windows 7 SP1]] retail release was initially missing BrowserChoice.eu functionality, affecting 28 million computers. The error remained unpatched for 14 months, and as a result in March 2013 the European Commission fined Microsoft €561 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21684329 |title=Microsoft fined by European Commission over web browser |publisher=BBC |date=6 March 2013 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows 8]] was also released without the browser choice screen functionality and patched several days after the release. [[Mozilla]]'s general counsel estimated that 6-9 million downloads of Firefox web browser alone were lost due to the mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.com/firefox-lost-6-9-million-downloads-in-eu-browser-choice-glitch-7000006670/ |title=Firefox lost 6-9 million downloads in EU browser choice 'glitch' |last=Whittaker |first=Zach |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |date=31 October 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/10/3307564/windows-8-browser-choice-europe-windows-update |title=Windows 8 browser choice update now available in Europe |last=Warren |first=Tom |publisher=[[The Verge]] |date=10 September 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petition==
Makers of the second-tier browsers [[Flock (web browser)|Flock]], [[Avant Browser|Avant]], [[GreenBrowser]], [[Maxthon]], [[Sleipnir (web browser)|Sleipnir]], and [[SlimBrowser|Slim]] sent a petition to the EU to get [[Microsoft]] to add text or a graphic (rather than just the slider) indicating that there are more than five browsers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flock.com/petition_to_the_european_commission.pdf Petition To The European Commission]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030021348/http://flock.com/petition_to_the_european_commission.pdf |date=30 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft responded by stating: ''"We (Microsoft) do not plan on making any changes at this time."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20000129-264.html |title=Minor browsers seek more prominence in Europe |publisher=CNET |last=Shankland |first=Stephen |date=5 March 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11347">'''Buzz monitoring''' is the monitoring of consumer responses to commercial services and products in order to establish the [[marketing buzz]] surrounding a new or existing offer. Similar to [[media monitoring]] it is becoming increasingly popular as a base for strategic insight development alongside other forms of [[market research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-buzz-monitoring.htm|work=wiseGEEK|title=What Is Buzz Monitoring?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buzz monitoring involves the checking and analysis of myriad online sources such as [[internet forum]]s, [[blog]]s, and [[social network]]s. Data can be provided in real time, which means that critical issues can be picked up instantly. It is also comparatively inexpensive compared to other [[market research]] tools and can actually guide further product and service developments.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} [[Social influence|Influence]] is a key question in buzz monitoring – does this particular person and/or this particular piece of content matter and is it influencing others? Hence, the influence of a source is an important buzz monitoring [[Software metric|metric]] that should be benchmarked.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Buzz monitoring is implemented by businesses for a variety of reasons, namely to improve efficiency, reaction times and identify future opportunities. Insights gained can help guide marketing and communications, identify positive and negative customer experiences, assess product and service demand, tackle [[crisis management]], round off [[competitor analysis]], establish [[brand equity]] and predict [[market share]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==Tools==
In the era of the technological prosperity, [[social network]]s have become an essential tool for buzz monitoring, due to the large scale of opinions and information shared between users.&lt;ref name=Cuvelier&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cuvelier|first1=Etienne|last2=Aufaure|first2=Marie-Aude|title=A buzz and e-reputation monitoring tool for twitter based on galois lattices|date=2011|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|location=Berlin, Germany|pages=91–103|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-22688-5_7|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the growing interest in monitoring and scrutinizing opinions shared on-line was the subject of a TREC Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ounis|last2=de Rijke|last3=Mishne|last4=Soboroff|title=Overview of the trec 2006 blog track|journal=The Fifteenth Text Retrieval Conference Proceedings|date=2006|volume=272|pages=17–31|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA512714|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the main advantages of using social networks for buzz monitoring is price availability, as this method could be considered cheap compared to other sources of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Blogging4Business report|journal=Strategic Direction|date=2006|volume=22|issue=9|pages=18–20|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/02580540610686504?journalCode=sd#|accessdate=27 October 2014|doi=10.1108/02580540610686504}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many types of social networks have added specific features which allow people to observe the on-line activity of their friends or followers. One of the first examples is the "Hot Topics" section on [[Blogspot]], which was added to the website in 2009.&lt;ref name=Cuvelier/&gt; Other social networks, including Google with "[[Google Alerts]]", [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and [[Yahoo]] have also added similar services. Twitter, which uses the [[micro-blogging]] platform, could be reasonably considered as one of the most powerful free tool for buzz monitoring.&lt;ref name=Cuvelier/&gt;  With its micro-blogging facilities, users can share their thoughts quickly and promptly, view the latest trending topics, and search the profiles of people without the need to "follow" them. 
Other widely used tools such as [[Mention (company)|Mention]], Alterian-SM2, BrandWatch and Converseon are designed specifically for monitoring information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savrakantonakis|title=An approach for evaluation of social media monitoring tools|journal=Common Value Management|date=2012|volume=52|url=http://wiki.iao.fraunhofer.de/images/studien/proceedings-common-value-management.pdf#page=52|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These online tools are not available for free; however, they provide more features and are more complicated and sophisticated than online platforms such as Google Alerts.   
When deciding which tool would better suit a specific product, one needs to carefully consider some features such as which market segment one wants to consider and what type of data one is expecting to collect.  For example, if someone wished to define the strategy for the future, they would probably be looking for the tool that allows them to track information during the past several months or years.   
The collected information can then be restrained using data analysis tools, built on [[Structured Query Language]] (SQL) for later use.&lt;ref name=Kirby&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirby|first1=Justin|last2=Marsden|first2=Paul|title=Connected Marketing: The Viral, Buzz and Word of Mouth Revolution|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of buzz==
The direct correlation between the consumer response and the success of the brand or product has recently been determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reichheld |first1=F.F. |title=The one number you need to grow |journal=Harvard Business Review |date=2003 |volume=81 |issue=12 |pages=26–54 |url=https://www2.aap.org/qualityimprovement/quiin/workspaces/MedHome/Tools/one_question.pdf |accessdate=27 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104173523/https://www2.aap.org/qualityimprovement/quiin/workspaces/MedHome/Tools/one_question.pdf |archivedate=4 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The buzz around the certain product can be divided into several groups: positive buzz, sometimes called "white buzz", negative buzz, also called "black buzz", and neutral buzz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strapparava|last2=Guerini|last3=Ozbal|title=Persuasive language and virality in social networks|date=2011|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|location=Berlin, Germany|pages=357–366}}&lt;/ref&gt; The white and the black buzz correspondingly can be calculated using binaryEnotion and following formulas:

:White Buzz = (Positive &gt; (Neutral + Negative))
:Black Buzz =  (Negative &gt; (Neutral + Positive))&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guerini|last2=Strapparava|last3=Ozbal|title=Exploring Text Virality in Social Neworks|url=http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM11/paper/viewFile/2820/3235|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abovementioned notations can be best described by the assumption that the white buzz is formed when the total amount of positive comments is greater than the sum of neutral and negative ones. The same can be applied in the case of the black buzz.  To obtain more accurate data, it might be prudent to search as much information as possible, as the correctness of data is directly proportional to the amount of the consumers' responses examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fensel|first1=Dieter|last2=Kett|first2=Holger|last3=Grobelnik|first3=Marko|title=Common Value Management 1st International Workshop on Common Value Management|url=http://cvm2012.sti-innsbruck.at|publisher=ESWC2012|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have indicated that the impact of negative comments tends to be higher than that of positive ones as they think they are more credible. However, it might depend on customer's reaction on different type of comments.&lt;ref name=Shin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shin|last2=Hanssens|last3=Gajula|title=The impact of positive vs. negative online buzz on retail prices|date=2008|publisher=UCLA working paper|location=CL, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People are also more inclined to share a negative experience than a positive one in order to raise public awareness and prevent their friends and relatives from using the same service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diener|last2=Greyser|title=Cosumer views of redress needs|journal=J. Marketing|date=1978|volume=42|pages=21–27|doi=10.2307/1250081}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, it might be recommended for a big company to reduce the black buzz around the product or brand rather than increasing the amount of positive comments.&lt;ref name=Kirby/&gt;

==Effects==
Buzz, also sometimes referred to as a "[[word-of-mouth]] phenomenon", has always been around and can have a great effect on a product's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walter|first1=J. Carl|title=What's all the buzz about?: Everyday communication and relational bases of Word-of-Mouth and Buzz marketing practices|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|date=May 2006|volume=19|pages=601–634}}&lt;/ref&gt; While advertisements get more obsolete and hard to understand, communication between the user and producer is becoming more and more common.&lt;ref name=Kirby/&gt; Managers of the company should always be aware of the buzz surrounding their product, work in cooperation with the audience and be constantly prepared to stop any enormous negative attack from the core. Having collected all necessary information from the customers, managers should compare the functioning in the market of their own product to the competitor's one and to determine the further strategy, defining strong and weak sides of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mattern|first1=F.|last2=Huhn|first2=W.|last3=Perrey|first3=J.|last4=Dorner|first4=K.|last5=Lorenz|first5=J.|last6=Spillecke|first6=D.|title=Turning buzz into gold. How pioneers create value from media|date=2012|publisher=McKinsey&amp;Company|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As suggested, there are exactly two pathways of the response to an online buzz from the different point of views. Managers of the companies affected by an existing buzz would try to reduce or increase the costs of the product depending on what kind of reviews they have received; they also might try to improve the service or goods in case of prevailing amount of negative opinions. Customers would likewise make their decisions about the product, deciding to either buy it in future or avoid further usage. Both pathways directly affect the company's profitability and brand image.&lt;ref name=Shin/&gt;  When used in the right way, buzz monitoring could also increase the public awareness of the product.

However, there are also some disadvantages linked to buzz monitoring. As online buzz is getting more important and easy to access, marketing agents are trying to increase the ratio of positive reviews and to create the great amount of buzz around the certain product or service they need to sell in order to increase the profit and public awareness.

'''Chang Jung-fa''' [[CBE]] ({{zh|c=張榮發|p=Zhāng Róngfā}}; 6 October 1927 – 20 January 2016) was a Taiwanese businessman. He founded and chaired the [[Evergreen Group]].

== Biography ==
Chang was born in [[Su'ao]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/01/21/2003637689|archivedate=21 January 2016|last1=Sun|first1=Yu-Huay|title=Chang Yung-fa, Taiwan's Evergreen Group Founder, Dies at 88|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-20/chang-yung-fa-founder-of-taiwan-s-evergreen-group-dies-at-88|accessdate=20 January 2016|work=Bloomberg|date=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan was under Japanese rule]]. When he was seven, the family moved to [[Keelung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Shu-fen|last2=Liu|first2=Claudia|last3=Wu|first3=Lilian|title=Evergreen Group founder passes away|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201601200021.aspx|accessdate=20 January 2016|agency=Central News Agency|date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Taipei Commercial High School at the age of 18, he went to work in the [[Taipei]] office of a Japanese shipping line. He continued his education by taking night classes at a vocational school in Taipei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2016/01/20/taiwans-evergreen-marine-billionaire-founder-chang-yung-fa-dies/#2715e4857a0b7b408c823cc0|title=Taiwan's Evergreen Marine Billionaire Founder Chang Yung-fa Dies|author=Russell Flannery|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], he joined the seagoing staff of a local shipping company as [[third mate|third officer]]. His subsequent career was spent with various local companies and he progressed through the ranks to [[Captain (nautical)|captain]].

In 1961, Chang and some friends jointly established a shipping company and, having helped this company to develop, he decided to branch out on his own, establishing Evergreen Marine Corporation on 1 September 1968 with just one secondhand 15,000 ton vessel, Central Trust.

Over the next four years, Chang built his fleet up to twelve, running them empty when necessary to convince his customers his services were regular and reliable. Within a year, he had expanded to the Middle East. Within three, Chang was dispatching Evergreen ships to the Caribbean.

In 1975, Chang realised that containerisation was the way forward. He built four advanced S-type container ships and launched his [[US East Coast]] service. Fifteen months later, he added the [[West coast of the United States]] to his network. Europe followed in 1979.

By 1984, he started his most ambitious service yet- two 80-day round-the-world services, one circling the globe in an easterly direction, the other westward. Departing every 10 days, the 20 G-type container ships he employed had a capacity of 2,728 containers each and could travel at a speed of 20.5 [[knot (unit)|knots]].

The Evergreen Group has expanded beyond the shipping industry to encompass operations in heavy industrial development, air transport, hotels and resorts services.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;Jennings, Ralph.

Retrieved 27 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Evergreen Group, with over 27,000 employees and more than 220 offices worldwide, now comprises about 30 major corporations worldwide, 3 of which are listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. During the 2012 Republic of China presidential election, Mr Chang expressed his disapproval of the so-called [[Taiwan Consensus]]. The China Post reported that he said that the ""Taiwan Consensus" smacks of Taiwan independence" which the paper said was "not his cup of tea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ting|first1=David Kan|title=Taiwan's Re-Election of KMT's Ma Is Nod|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/the-china-post/david-ting/2012/01/20/329564/Taiwans-re-election.htm|accessdate=21 January 2016|work=China Post|date=20 January 2012|archiveurl=https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1P3-2564902241/taiwan-s-re-election-of-kmt-s-ma-is-nod|archivedate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, it was reported that Chang had pledged "to give away all his wealth" (approximately US$1.69&amp;nbsp;billion), primarily via the [[Chang Yung-fa Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2012/02/08/330949/Evergreen-founder.htm "Evergreen founder to donate entire fortune"], ''China Post'', 8 February 2012. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chang was married twice, first to Lin Chin-chih, with whom he had four children. His second wife Lee Yu-mei bore him one son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wei|first1=Shu|last2=Chang|first2=S.C.|title=Evergreen group 'regrets' Chang Kuo-wei's announcement of taking helm|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201602180032.aspx|accessdate=18 February 2016|agency=Central News Agency|date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 January 2016, Chang died at the age of 88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=As of 2:22&amp;nbsp;am |url=http://www.todayonline.com/business/chang-yung-fa-founder-taiwans-evergreen-group-dies-88 |title=Chang Yung-fa, founder of Taiwan's Evergreen Group, dies at 88 |work=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cleanability''' is a term used in clean productions (e.g. to assess the cleanability of technical surfaces).

In order to ensure optimum cleanability of the surfaces of machines and equipment, they must fulfill certain requirements. Where surfaces come into contact with media, no deposits may be formed which could impair product quality. Therefore, the surface roughness of such areas should be below 0.8 [[µm]] (see [[EHEDG]] doc. 8). If the degree of roughness is exceeded, resistances may develop during disinfection processes. These occur when microorganisms only come into contact with disinfectants but are not killed by them. When ascertaining the cleanability of a surface with regard to particles, the analysis can be carried out in correlation with the surface cleanliness classes described in VDI 2083 Part 9.1. Surface roughness can be measured, for example, using profile methods (DIN EN ISO 11562) or AFM (atomic force microscope). However, no norm is currently in existence which describes a standardized AFM procedure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1724">The '''Comisión Federal de Competencia''' (CFC), or '''Federal Competition Commission''', is an agency of the government of [[Mexico]], under the Ministry of Economy. Established in 1993, it is responsible for implementation of the [[Federal Economic Competition Law]] (LFCE).

The CFC was established in 1993. It is headed by five commissioners who serve 10-year terms, who are appointed by the [[President of Mexico|Mexican president]]. One commissioner serves as president of the commission. The CFC also employs 175 other people, including 41 support staff.

The mission of the CFC is to "protect the process of competition and free access to markets, through the prevention and elimination of monopolistic practices and other restrictions to market efficiency, in order to contribute to societal welfare." Functions of the CFC include approval of [[mergers and acquisitions]], investigating and penalizing [[monopoly|monopolistic]] conduct, authorizing business activities in regulated sectors, and advocacy for competition in the marketplace. Article 28 of [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexico's constitution]] prohibits monopolies, but a more complete competition policy was set out in the LFCE (1993).

In 1621, he helped negotiate a peace treaty for Morocco with France.&lt;ref name=Moroccan /&gt;

From 1630 onwards, he took over from his brother Abraham as unofficial Dutch consul in Safi, Morocco.&lt;ref name=Moroccan /&gt;

He also served as agent to France, where in 1634 when [[Louis XIII of France]] demanded his father's extradition, after which David succeeded him in 1637.&lt;ref name=Woordenboek /&gt;

In 1634, apparently to clear some debts, he became involved commercially with Michael Spinoza (father of philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]).&lt;ref name=Moroccan /&gt;

==Personal and death==

The scholarly biography ''A Man of Three Worlds: Samuel Pallache, a Moroccan Jew in Catholic and Protestant Europe'' did not find intermarriage between the Pallache brothers or sons and members of the Portuguese Sephardic community in the Netherlands.  In fact, it documents the contrary, e.g., that sons Isaac and Joshua did not go make such marriages.  "It seems significant that no male member of the Pallache family ever married a woman from the Portuguese community...  it is surely significant that neither Samuel nor any of his heirs were ever to marry into the great trading families of 'the Portuguese nation'."&lt;ref name=three&gt;

However, he would be best known for a 10-year stint with German [[Bundesliga]] outfit [[Hertha BSC]], where he would be a defensive mainstay for a side that participated in five [[UEFA Cup]] editions and the [[1999–2000 UEFA Champions League]] (as a result of a third league place in [[1998–99 Bundesliga|1998–99]], with Van Burik subsequently appearing in ten Champions League contests, as Hertha reached the second group stage).

Van Burik was dismissed by Hertha after the club accused him of playing a role in the departure of teammate [[Jérôme Boateng]], who was a client of van Burik's father and football agent Karel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.trouw.nl/home/wegen-van-burik-en-hertha-bsc-scheiden~a00cb2ff/ Wegen Van Burik en Hertha BSC scheiden] - Trouw {{nl|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently retired in June 2007.

[[File:Francisco Hernandez Giron 2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Francisco Hernández Girón]] was a Spanish ''encomendero'' in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] who protested the [[New Laws]] in 1553. These laws, passed in 1542, gave certain rights to indigenous peoples and protected them against abuses. Drawing by [[Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala]].]]
{{Slavery|Region}}
'''''Encomienda''''' ({{IPA-es|eŋkoˈmjenda}}) was a Spanish labor system. It rewarded  conquerors with the labor of particular groups of subject people. It was first established in Spain during the Roman period, but used also following the Christian conquest of Muslim territories. It was applied on a much larger scale during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] and the [[Philippines]]. Conquered peoples were considered vassals of the [[Spanish monarch]]. The Crown awarded an ''encomienda'' as a grant to a particular individual. In the conquest era of the sixteenth century, the grants were considered to be a monopoly on the labor of particular groups of Indians ([[indigenous peoples]]), held in perpetuity by the grant holder, called the ''encomendero'', and his descendants.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart and Stuart Schwartz, ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Encomiendas were a form of "communal" slavery. In the ''encomienda'', the Spanish Crown granted a person a specified number of natives from a specific community, but did not dictate which individuals in the community would have to provide their labor. Indigenous leaders were charged with mobilizing the assessed tribute and labor. In turn, ''encomenderos'' were to ensure that the encomienda natives were given instruction in the Christian faith and Spanish language, and protect them from warring tribes or pirates; they had to suppress rebellion against Spaniards, and maintain infrastructure. In return, the natives would provide tributes in the form of metals, maize, wheat, pork, or other agricultural products.

With the ouster of [[Christopher Columbus]], the Spanish crown sent a royal governor, Fray [[Nicolás de Ovando]], who established the formal ''encomienda'' system.&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases natives were forced to do hard labor and subjected to extreme punishment and death if they resisted.&lt;ref name="encslav"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion|page=184|volume=1|first=Junius P.|last=Rodriguez|year=2007|isbn=978-0-313-33272-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g_kuS42BxIYC&amp;pg=PA184}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]] of Castile forbade Indian slavery and deemed the indigenous to be "free vassals of the crown".&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, 143&lt;/ref&gt; Various versions of the ''Leyes de Indias'' or [[Laws of the Indies]] from 1512 onwards attempted to regulate the interactions between the settlers and natives. Both natives and Spaniards appealed to the [[Real Audiencia]]s for relief under the ''encomienda'' system.

''Encomiendas'' had often been characterized by the geographical displacement of the enslaved and breakup of communities and family units, but in Mexico, the ''encomienda'' ruled the free vassals of the crown through existing community hierarchies, and the natives were allowed to keep in touch with their families and homes.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule,'' Stanford, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The heart of ''encomienda'' and ''encomendero'' lies in the Spanish verb ''encomendar'', "to entrust". The ''encomienda'' was based on the ''[[reconquista]]'' institution in which ''[[adelantado]]s'' were given the right to extract tribute from Muslims or other [[peasant]]s in areas that they had conquered and resettled.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;
The ''encomienda'' system traveled to America as the result of the implantation of Castilian law over the territory. The system was created in the Middle Ages and was pivotal to allow for the repopulation and protection of frontier land during the [[reconquista]]. The encomienda established a relationship similar to a feudal relationship, in which military protection was traded for certain tributes or by specific work. It was especially prevalent among military orders that were entrusted with the protection of frontier areas. The king usually intervened directly or indirectly in the bond, by guaranteeing the fairness of the agreement and intervening militarily in case of abuse.

The ''encomienda'' system in Spanish America differed from the Peninsular institution. The ''encomenderos'' did not own the land on which the natives lived. The system did not entail any direct land tenure by the ''encomendero''; Indian lands were to remain in the possession of their communities. This right was formally protected by the crown of Castile because the rights of administration in the [[New World]] belonged to this crown and not to the [[Catholic monarchs]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Meredith, "[http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html The Encomienda System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218180735/http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/papers/scott-m.html |date=2005-12-18 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Encomenderos''==
[[File:Hernán_Cortés_(Meister_von_Saldana).gif|thumb|right|[[Hernán Cortés]], conqueror of the Aztecs and premier encomendero of [[New Spain]]]]
The first grantees of the ''encomienda'' or ''encomenderos'' were usually conquerors who received these grants of labor by virtue of participation in a successful conquest. Later, some receiving ''encomiendas'' in [[New Spain]] (Mexico) were not conquerors themselves but were sufficiently well connected that they received grants.

In his study of the ''encomenderos'' of early colonial Mexico, Robert Himmerich y Valencia divides conquerors into those who were part of [[Hernán Cortés]]' original expedition, calling them "first conquerors", and those who were members of the later [[Pánfilo de Narváez|Narváez]] expedition, calling them "conquerors". The latter  were incorporated into Cortes' contingent. Himmerick designated as ''pobladores antiguos'' (old settlers), a group of undetermined number of ''encomenderos'' in New Spain, men who had resided in the Caribbean region prior to the Spanish conquest of Mexico.

Holders of ''encomiendas'' also included women and indigenous elite. Doña Maria Jaramillo, the daughter of [[La Malinche|Doña Marina]] and conqueror Juan Jaramillo, received income from her deceased father's ''encomiendas''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain, 1521-1555'', Austin: University of Texas Press, 1991 p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Moctezuma's daughters, Doña [[Isabel Moctezuma]] and her younger sister, Doña Leonor Moctezuma, were granted extensive ''encomiendas'' in perpetuity by Hernan Cortes. Doña Leonor Moctezuma married in succession two Spaniards, and left the ''encomiendas'' to her daughter by her second husband.&lt;ref&gt;Himmerich y Valencia (1991), ''The Encomenderos'', pp. 195-96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Samora |first=Julian |author2=Patricia Vandel Simon |title=A History of the Mexican-American People |url=http://www.jsri.msu.edu/museum/pubs/MexAmHist/chapter3.html#five |accessdate=2009-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402165741/http://www.jsri.msu.edu/museum/pubs/MexAmHist/chapter3.html |archivedate=April 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Himmerich y Valencia (1991), 27&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vassal]] Inca rulers appointed after the conquest also sought and were granted ''encomiendas''.

The status of humans as [[Ward (law)|wards]] of the trustees under the ''encomienda'' system served to "define the status of the Indian population": the natives were free men, not slaves or serfs.{{cn|date=November 2018}} But some Spaniards treated them as poorly as slaves.

The ''encomienda'' was essential to the Spanish crown's sustaining its control over North, Central and South America in the first decades after the colonization. It was the first major organizational law instituted on the continent, which was affected by war, widespread disease epidemics caused by Eurasian diseases, and resulting turmoil. The settler-conquistadors were confronted by the fury of the aroused Indian lords; voyagers, explorers, and the friars did not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Inga Clendinnen|Clendinnen, Inga]]; ''Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatán, 1517–1570''. (p. 83) {{ISBN|0-521-37981-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the ''encomienda'' system was devised to meet the needs of the early agricultural economies in the Caribbean. Later it was adopted to the mining economy of [[Peru]] and [[Upper Peru]]. The ''encomienda'' lasted from the beginning of the sixteenth century to the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9032596|title= Encomienda|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online|date= 26 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip II, enacted a law on 11 June 1594 to establish the ''encomienda'' in the [[Philippines]], where he made grants to the local nobles (''[[principalía]]''). They used the ''encomienda'' to gain ownership of large expanses of land, many of which (such as [[Makati]]) continue to be owned by affluent families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Dr. Eric A|title=The encomienda in early Philippine colonial history|year=1976|publisher=Journal of Asian Studies|location=Quezon City|pages=27–32|url=http://asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-14-2-1976/anderson-encomienda-philippine-history.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Establishment ==
In 1501 [[Isabella of Castile|Queen Isabella]] declared Native Americans as subjects to the crown, and so, as Castilians and legal equals to Spanish Castilians. This implied that enslaving them was illegal except on very specific conditions. It also allowed the establishment of encomiendas, since the encomienda bond was a right reserved to full subjects to the crown.
In 1503, the crown began to formally grant ''encomiendas'' to conquistadors and officials as rewards for service to the crown. The system of ''encomiendas'' was aided by the crown's organizing the indigenous into small harbors known as ''[[Indian Reductions|reducciones]]'', with the intent of establishing new towns and populations.

Each ''reducción'' had a native chief responsible for keeping track of the laborers in his community. The ''encomienda'' system did not grant people land, but it indirectly aided in the settlers' acquisition of land. As initially defined, the ''encomendero'' and his heirs expected to hold these grants in perpetuity. After a major crown reform in 1542, known as the [[New Laws]], encomendero families were restricted to holding the grant for two generations. When the crown attempted to implement the policy in Peru, shortly after the 1535 Spanish conquest, Spanish recipients rebelled against the crown, killing the viceroy, Don [[Blasco Núñez Vela]].

In Mexico, viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] decided against implementing the reform, citing local circumstances and the potential for a similar conqueror rebellion. To the crown he said, "I obey crown authority but do not comply with this order."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Aiton, ''Antonio de Mendoza, First Viceroy of New Spain,'' Durham: Duke University Press 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''encomienda'' system was ended legally in 1720, when the crown attempted to abolish the institution. The ''encomenderos'' were then required to pay remaining ''encomienda'' laborers for their work.

The ''encomiendas'' became very corrupt and harsh. In the neighborhood of La Concepción, north of Santo Domingo, the ''[[adelantado]]'' of Santiago heard rumors of a 15,000-man army planning to stage a rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=guarionex+revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CQw5TLT7NYGC8ga_zYWoBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=15%2C000&amp;f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing this, the Adelantado captured the ''[[cacique]]s'' involved and had most of them hanged.

Later, a chieftain named [[Guarionex]] laid havoc to the countryside before an Indian-Spanish army of about 3,090 routed the [[Ciguana people]] under his leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=guarionex+revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CQw5TLT7NYGC8ga_zYWoBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&amp;q=three%20thousand%20islanders&amp;f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although expecting Spanish protection from warring tribes, the islanders &lt;!-- where are we? I thought this was about Mexico --&gt;sought to join the Spanish forces. They helped the Spaniards deal with their ignorance of the surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=De Orbe Novo, the Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera | author=Pietro Martire D'Anghiera | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7hU_LePtIQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=water%20extreme%20heat&amp;f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As noted, the change of requiring the ''encomendado'' to be returned to the crown after two generations was frequently overlooked, as the colonists did not want to give up the labor or power. The ''Codice Osuna'', one of many colonial-era [[Aztec codices]] (indigenous manuscripts) with native pictorials and alphabetic text in [[Nahuatl]], there is evidence that the indigenous were well aware of the distinction between indigenous communities held by individual encomenderos and those held by the crown.&lt;ref&gt;''Codice Osuna,'' Ediciones del Instituto Indigenista Interamericano, Mexico 1947, pp. 250-254&lt;/ref&gt; In 1574, the Viceroy of Peru [[Diego López de Zúñiga, 4th Count of Nieva|Diego Lopez de Velasco]] investigated the ''encomiendas''. He concluded there were 32,000 Spanish families in the New World, 4,000 of whom had ''encomiendas''. They oversaw 1,500,000 natives paying tribute, and 5 million "civilized" natives.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, John A. ''The Epic of Latin America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "''sin indios no hay Indias''" (without Indians, there are no Indies – i.e. America), popular in Spanish America especially in the 16th century, emphasizes the economic importance and appeal of this [[indentured labor]]. It was ranked higher than allocations of precious metals or other natural resources. Land awardees customarily complained about how "worthless" territory was without a population of ''encomendados''.

===Encomienda and epidemics===

The native people of Mexico experienced a series of outbreaks of disease in the wake of European conquest, including a catastrophic epidemic that began in 1545 which killed an estimated 5 million to 15 million people, or up to 80% of the native population of Mexico, followed by a second epidemic from 1576 to 1578 killing an additional 2 to 2.5 million people, or about 50% of the remaining native population. Recent research suggests that these infections appear to have been aggravated by the extreme climatic conditions of the time and by the poor living conditions and harsh treatment of the native people under the encomienda system of New Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo Acuna-Soto, David W. Stahle, Malcolm K. Cleaveland,  and Matthew D. Therrell (April 2002). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730237/ "Megadrought and Megadeath in 16th Century Mexico"], ''Emerg Infect Dis.'', 8(4), pp. 360–362. doi:  10.3201/eid0804.010175. Retrieved 16 Jan. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethnocide====
[[Raphael Lemkin]] (coiner of the term [[genocide]]) considers Spain's abuses of the [[Amerindian|Native]] population of the Americas to constitute cultural and even outright [[genocide]] including the abuses of the Encomienda system. He described slavery as "cultural genocide par excellence" noting "it is the most effective and thorough method of destroying culture, of desocializing human beings." He considers colonist guilty due to failing to halt the abuses of the system despite royal orders. He also notes the [[genocidal rape|sexual abuse]] of Spanish colonizers of Native women as acts of "biological [[genocide]]."&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Lemkin's History of Genocide and Colonialism&lt;br&gt;
Holocaust Memorial Museum https://www.ushmm.org/confront-genocide/speakers-and-events/all-speakers-and-events/raphael-lemkin-history-of-genocide-and-colonialism&lt;/ref&gt; Yale University's [[genocide studies]] program supports this view, citing the decline of the [[Taíno]] population of [[Hispaniola]] in 1492 to 1514 as an example noting their population declined from 1,000,000 to 100,000 to only 32,000 a decline of 68% to over 96%.&lt;ref&gt;Hispaniola Case Study: Colonial Genocides&lt;br&gt;Date range of image:1492 to 1514 https://gsp.yale.edu/case-studies/colonial-genocides-project/hispaniola&lt;/ref&gt; Those numbers are largely based on the accounts of Las Casas and the letters that  wrote during the epidemics. [[Darcy Ribeiro]] considers that native exploitation was the fuel of the productivity of the Spanish Colonies and, [[H. F. Dobyns]] estimated 95%.

Since 1960 several Hispanists and anthropologists, like [[Julian Juderias]] or [[Cook y Borah]] have challenged both the numbers and the causes offered by Raphael Lemkin. [[Frequency distribution of the main mtDNA American haplogroups in Native American populations|Recent genetic studies]] Their genetic testing of the present-day American native population showed that a 96% decline did not occur, based on the remaining genetic diversity of the native populace tested.&lt;ref&gt;Various Authors. A global analysis of Y-chromosomal haplotype diversity for 23 STR loci. Forensic Science International: Genetics Volume 12, September 2014, Pages 12-23&lt;/ref&gt; Their study allowed for a maximum possible decline of 25% in the population based on their findings. Brendan D. O'Fallona and Lars Fehren-Schmitz separately estimated a historic native mortality of about 50% loss with a quick recovery and little loss in diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Brendan D. O'Fallona and Lars Fehren-Schmitz. ''Native Americans experienced a strong population bottleneck coincident with European contact.'' Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Dec 20; 108(51): 20444–20448. Published online 2011 Dec 5. doi:  10.1073/pnas.1112563108 {{PMC|3251087}} {{PMID|22143784}} Anthropology&lt;/ref&gt; Quentin D Atkinson Cook and Borah [[Universidad de California en Berkeley]] conducted a decade long study on the historical native demographics of Mexico and estimated that the overall decrease in native population was only 3%.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, S. F. y W. W. Borah (1963), The Indian population of Central Mexico, Berkeley (Cal.), University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenblat estimates a lower number for Mexico and Colombia. Acuna-Soto R1, Romero LC, and Maguire JH suggested the rate of mortality from disease in native American populations at around 45%.&lt;ref&gt;Acuna-Soto R1, Romero LC, Maguire JH. Large epidemics of hemorrhagic fevers in Mexico 1545-1815.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the specific number, it is widely agreed that the peak in mortality started in 1545 and peaked some years later after the New Laws were put in place, the encomienda system was abolished, and women, and more importantly children, were allowed to migrate. What mortality of the native population did occur was mainly attributable to disease. Most scholars agree that the main culprits were European infantile diseases like smallpox, measles, and chicken pox.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Guerra. Origen de las epidemias en la conquista de América&lt;/ref&gt; Elsa Malvido suggests that the plague caused the hemorrhagic fevers described by the Spanish physicians, while a recent, controversial study recently proposed by microbiologist [[Rodolfo Acuna-Soto]] suggests that the diseases that decimated the population were actually a native hemorrhagic plague carried by rats.&lt;ref&gt;RODOLFO ACUNA-SOTO, LETICIA CALDERON ROMERO, AND JAMES H.

==Abolition==
===Previously===
The ''encomienda'' system was the subject of controversy in Spain and its territories almost from its start. In 1510, an [[Hispaniola]] ''encomendero'' named Valenzuela murdered a group of Native American leaders who had agreed to meet for peace talks in full confidence. The Taíno Cacique [[Enriquillo]] rebelled against the Spaniards between 1519 and 1533. In 1538, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], realizing the seriousness of the Taíno revolt, changed the laws governing the treatment of Indians laboring in the encomiendas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Columbus and Las Casas: the conquest and Christianization of America, 1492–1566 | author=David M. Traboulay | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Jmi4Wb1DdsC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=enriquillo+revolt&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=S08sTP7LHMXflgeajv2hCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=enriquillo%20revolt&amp;f=false | accessdate=10 July 2010 | page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceding to Las Casas's viewpoint, the peace treaty between the Taínos and the ''[[Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo|audiencia]]'' was eventually disrupted in four to five years. The crown also made two failed attempts to end the abuses of the ''encomienda'' system, through the Law of Burgos (1512–13) and the [[New Laws|New Law of the Indies (1542)]]. Furthermore, these laws were indeed beneficial to the authorities.

The priest of Hispaniola and former ''encomendero'' [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] underwent a profound conversion after seeing the abuse of the native people.&lt;ref&gt;Bartolomé de Las Casas, who arrived in the New World in 1502, averred that greed was the reason Christians “murdered on such a vast scale,” killing “anyone and everyone who has shown the slightest sign of resistance,” and subjecting “all males to the harshest and most iniquitous and brutal slavery that man has ever devised for oppressing his fellow-men, treating them, in fact, worse than animals.” Reséndez, Andrés. The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story of Indian Enslavement in America (Kindle Locations 338-341). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; He dedicated his life to writing and lobbying to abolish the ''encomienda'' system, which he thought systematically enslaved the native people of the New World. Las Casas participated in an [[Valladolid debate|important debate]], where he pushed for the enactment of the New Laws and an end to the ''encomienda'' system.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Keen, ''Bartolome de las Casas in history: toward an understanding of the man and his work''. (DeKalb: Northern Illinois University, 1971), 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt; The Laws of Burgos and the New Laws of the Indies failed in the face of colonial opposition and, in fact, the New Laws were postponed in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. When [[Blasco Núñez Vela]], the first viceroy of Peru, tried to enforce the New Laws, which provided for the gradual abolition of the ''encomienda'', many of the ''encomenderos'' were unwilling to comply with them and revolted against him.

===The New Laws of 1542===
{{Main|New Laws}}

When the news of this situation and of the abuse of the institution reached Spain, the [[New Laws]] were passed to regulate and gradually abolish the system in America, as well as to reiterate the prohibition of enslaving Native Americans. By the time the new laws were passed, 1543, the Spanish crown had acknowledged their inability to control and properly ensure compliance of traditional laws overseas, so they granted to Native Americans specific protections not even Spaniards had, such as the prohibition of enslaving them even in the case of crime or war. This extra protections were an attempt to avoid the proliferation of irregular claims to slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Suárez Romero. LA SITUACIÓN JURÍDICA DEL INDIO DURANTE LA CONQUISTA ESPAÑOLA EN AMÉRICA. REVISTA DE LA FACULTAD DE DERECHO DE MÉXICO TOMO LXVIII, Núm.270 (Enero-Abril 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repartimiento==
Nevertheless, the ''encomienda'' system was generally replaced by the crown-managed ''[[repartimiento]]'' system throughout Spanish America after mid-century.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Like the ''encomienda'', the new ''repartimento'' did not include the attribution of land to anyone, rather only the allotment of native workers. But they were directly allotted to the crown, who, through a local crown official, would assign them to work for settlers for a set period of time, usually several weeks. The ''repartimiento'' was an attempt "to reduce the abuses of forced labour".&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; As the number of [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives declined]] and mining activities were replaced by agricultural activities in the seventeenth century, the [[hacienda]], or large landed estates in which laborers were directly employed by the hacienda owners (''hacendados''), arose because land ownership became more profitable than acquisition of forced labor.&lt;ref&gt;Tindall, George Brown &amp; David E. Shi (1984). ''America: A Narrative History'' (Sixth ed.). W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''encomienda'' was strongly based on the ''encomendado''{{'}}s tribal identity. Mixed-race ([[Mestizo]]) individuals, for example, could not by law be subjected to the ''encomienda''. This moved many Amerindians to deliberately seek to dilute their tribal identity and that of their descendants as a way for them to escape the service, by seeking intermarriage with people from different [[ethnic group|ethnicities]], especially Spaniards or Creoles. In this way the ''encomienda'' somewhat weakened Amerindians' tribal identification and ethnicity, which in turn diminished the pool of available ''encomendados''.

The '''European Business History Association''' (EBHA) is an [[Academic|academic association]] devoted to [[business history]] in Europe. It holds annual congresses (called conferences until 2013) and a bi-annual doctoral summer school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EBHA Summer School|url=http://www.ebha.org/?seite=summer%20school|website=www.ebha.org|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is registered as a [[Scottish charity]]. Its constitution states its objectives as "''to advance the education of the public concerning all aspects of the history of business and management in Europe and in the environment in which they operate and to promote research into all such aspects''".
Its aim is the organization of conferences and seminars, the publication of a newsletter and other materials, the encouragement of research in all aspects of business history, and specifically the promotion of collaborative projects based in several European countries such as The Performance of European Business in the 20th Century project per instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Performance of European Business in the 20th Century|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/BHU/research/performanceEB.aspx|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The association was established to enhance inter-European contacts and promote extra-European links among business historians, to encourage the exchange of business history graduate students and to promote teaching and interest in all such aspects.

== History of the association ==

The discussions to establish a European Business History Association followed in the wake of the successful foundation of the [[Association of Business Historians]] in Britain . Informal talks between [[Hans Pohl]] ([[University of Bonn]]), Geoffrey Jones (then at the [[University of Reading]]), and Tony Slaven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Glasgow story|url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH2159&amp;type=P|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[University of Glasgow]]) resulted in an invited meeting of representatives from a number of European countries in October 1993. This meeting was hosted and chaired by Tony Slaven at the Centre for Business History in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre for business history in Scotland|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/socialpolitical/research/economicsocialhistory/businesshistory/aboutus/|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants were not representative in any objective sense, but were those known to the organisers. They were [[Rolv Petter Amdam]] (BI Norwegian Business School, Norway), Michael Bibikov (Russia), Per Boje (Denmark), Hans Pohl (Germany), Keetie Sluyterman ([[University of Utrecht]], Netherlands), Mary Rose, Geoff Jones and Tony Slaven (UK). That meeting reviewed models for an EBHA, objectives, and necessary steps to shape and establish a new association. Subsequent meetings chaired by Tony Slaven followed rapidly in Bonn in February 1994 and in Rotterdam in June 1994. By this time the initial group had been joined by [[François Crouzet]] (France), Ulf Olsson (Sweden), and [[Even Lange]] (Norway). The meeting in Rotterdam at [[Erasmus University]] in June 1994 established the first draft of objectives, the conditions of membership, the structure to be adopted for office bearers and members of council, and election procedures. The Erasmus meeting also decided that it was necessary to take the proposals to a wider forum to gain support for the creation of a European Business History Association; it was also decided to establish a steering committee to plan a first conference.

The Business History Conference held at [[Erasmus University]] in October 1994 was taken as the opportunity to present the proposals to a large representative group of business historians drawn from many European countries. Tony Slaven acted as spokesman for the steering group and presented proposals to a general meeting at the Erasmus conference. The conference gave its support to the proposals and to the existing planning group to act as a steering committee to bring the European Business History Association into being. The first newsletter was planned for October 1995 and an inaugural conference was planned for August/September 1996. The working group was established as an interim council of the proposed EBHA for a period of two years from October 1995. Further planning meetings of the interim council took place in the University of Reading in March 1995 and Matthias Kipping was adopted as the first editor of the EBHA Newsletter. At that meeting in Reading it was agreed to hold the inaugural conference in August 1996 to be hosted by Ulf Olsson in the [[University of Gothenburg]]. A subsequent meeting in London in July 1996 was held to discuss potential collaboration with Manfred Pohl representing the new established Centre for European Business History based in Frankfurt. At that time, however, it was agreed to develop the interests of the new groups independently.

== Membership ==

'''
Membership is open to any individual interested in business history.
EBHA has over 200 members drawn from 29 different European and non-European countries.

== The Alliance of Centres for Business History in Europe ==

At the EBHA congress in Uppsala (2013), Centres for Business History and Business History Groups at European Universities and Business Schools have created a network in order to
(1.) improve communication and exchange between the large research groups in Business History;
(2.) improve cooperation and institutional support in research and teaching;
(3) improve PhD education in Business History.
The Alliance is a network under the umbrella of the EBHA and it is open to all European research environments in Business History with at least four [[Tenured|tenured positions]] within the respective University/Business School. These centres/groups are facing common challenges within their University/Business School, and they provide environments allowing for collaboration beyond conventional academic networking.
The Alliance meets annually in connection to the EBHA Congress.

Established in 1997 and part of Henley Business School at the University of Reading, the Centre for International Business History (CIBH) is the largest business history centre in the United Kingdom. CIBH strives to promote the study of the evolution of business and management in an international and comparative context. The Centre’s nine members mainly focus on various aspects of international business history, particularly on topics related to retailing, consumer goods industries, entrepreneurship, intellectual property, industrial finance, small firms, creative industries, and industrial clusters/districts. CIBH staff play active roles in various national and international business and economic history associations and are active participants at the main international conferences in these areas.

* Rotterdam, The Netherlands: Business History @ Erasmus [University of Rotterdam]

Business History @ Erasmus brings together researchers with an interest in the history of business. The platform is an initiative by the School of History, Culture &amp; Communication and the Rotterdam School of Management, both at Erasmus University Rotterdam, in the Netherlands.

* Uppsala, Sweden: Uppsala Centre for Business History (UCBH)

Uppsala Centre for Business History (UCBH) is organizationally and economically associated with the Department of Economic History at Uppsala University.
A large part of the research focuses on questions about the establishment and development of organizations and markets, primarily within the banking and financial sector of the economy. The dynamic interaction between organizations and institutions, both formal and informal, is considered an important factor in the analysis of development.

* Utrecht, The Netherlands: Business History at Utrecht University

Business History at Utrecht University focuses on the historical development of companies and entrepreneurs in their institutional context. As part of Economic and Social History (ESH) business history links to the central debate on the question why some countries are poor and others are rich. What is the role of business in economic growth and prosperity? Business History at UU is therefore closely related to the Centre for Global Economic History, the platform of the UU for pioneering research into the long term evolution of the world economy and its components. Business history is also an important part of the Commissioned Research group, which conducts research for third parties. This research often focuses on individual companies or sectors in their relationship to society. From these two perspectives business historians in Utrecht find their strength in the interaction between the scientific debate and individual case studies.

* York, UK: Centre for the evolution of Global Business and Institutions (CEGBI)

The Centre for Evolution of Global Business and Institutions (CEGBI) was inaugurated in 2009 with the aim of contributing with research to the understanding of how businesses and institutions around the world evolve, and also of helping to inform current management and policy issues. CEGBI’s main areas of research are international business history; global marketing; and governance, entrepreneurship and social enterprise. Distinctive features of CEGBI’s research include its interdisciplinarity and methodologies. It engages with topics of interest to business and management, economics, history, sociology, and law.

==Conferences==
The inaugural conference in Gothenburg in August 1996 attracted over 230 participants by which time the initial paid up membership of the new EBHA was 214 members. First nominations and elections for council added [[Franco Amatori]] ([[Bocconi University]]) , Albert Carreras ([[Pompeu Fabra University]]), [[Wilfried Feldenkirchen]], Ritta Hjerppe ([[Helsinki School of Economics]]), and Matthias Kipping to the first formally elected council. Tony Slaven was adopted as first President of EBHA with Geoff Jones as the first Secretary/Treasurer. It was decided in 1998 to hold an annual conference beginning with that held at Terni. Since then the association has met annually.

'''''Fox Business Happy Hour''''' was an American financial program aired on the [[Fox Business Network]] weekdays from 5-6pm [[Eastern Time]] and was hosted by [[Rebecca Diamond]], [[Cody Willard]] and [[Eric Bolling]].  

==About the program==
Debuting on October 15, 2007, this program takes viewers outside work to get the inside story of what's making news inside and outside the business world.  This show, which originally consisted of 2 co-hosts, Rebecca Gomez (now Rebecca Diamond) and Cody Willard, is set in a bar as it is produced at the Bull &amp; Bear pub in the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City.  The show concluded its run on June 4, 2010; to be replaced by "The Willis Report," anchored by [[Gerri Willis]] three days later. 

[[Eric Bolling]], who was previously a panelist on CNBC's ''Fast Money'' and is now a co-host of [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[The Five (TV program)|The Five]]'' and a host of Fox Business Network's ''Follow the Money'', joined the show as a panelist in August 2008 until he became the show's third co-host in November of that same year.

==Segments==
Some of the regular segments of this show (listed alphabetically) include the following:

*'''Cody's Shot Clock'''
*'''The Diamond District'''
*'''Street Meat'''
*'''So you think you're an Entrepreneur'''

==Special broadcasts==
On February 1, 2008, ''Fox Business Happy Hour'' was broadcast live from [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] (a [[suburb]] of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]).  This first-ever remote broadcast on location aired 2 days before [[Super Bowl XLII]].

On March 13 and 14, 2008, this program was broadcast live from Miami.  The March 14 broadcast covered that day's 195-point plunge on the Dow.

Short segments of the program are shown during [[New York Yankees]] game broadcasts on the [[YES Network]].

'''Frederick Irving Herzberg''' (April 18, 1923 – January 19, 2000&lt;ref name="desnews20000122"/&gt;) was an American [[psychologist]] who became one of the most influential names in business management.&lt;ref name="Biography - Frederick I. Herzberg (1923-2000)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.uwo.ca/programs/generalbusiness/herzberg.html |title=Biography - Frederick I.

I. Herzberg, 76, Professor And Management Consultant" /&gt;   He is most famous for introducing [[job enrichment]] and the [[Motivator-Hygiene theory]].  His 1968 publication "One More Time, How Do You Motivate Employees?" had sold 1.2 million reprints by 1987 and was the most requested article from the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''.&lt;ref name="Herzberg1987"&gt;{{cite journal |title=One More Time: How Do You Motivate Employees? |journal=Harvard Business Review |first=Frederick |last=Herzberg |volume=65 |issue=5 |date=September–October 1987 |oclc=23349159}} (''note: the reference to sales numbers is in the abstract written by the editors.'')&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|109–120}}

==Personal life==

Herzberg was born in 1923 in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], to Gertrude and Lewis Herzberg, who were Lithuanian immigrants. He enrolled at the [[City College of New York]] in 1939. He did not finish his studies as he enlisted in the army. In 1944 he married Shirley Bedell.

He finally finished his studies and graduated from the [[City College of New York]] in 1946. He then decided to move to the [[University of Pittsburgh]] where he earned a master's degree in science and public health. He completed a Ph.D. at Pittsburgh focused on electric shock therapy.

==Research==

Herzberg started his research on organizations in the 1950s. He worked at the [[University of Utah]], where he remained until he retired. Prior to his move to Utah, Herzberg was professor of management at Case Western Reserve University, where he established the Department of Industrial Mental Health.

In his lifetime, Herzberg had consulted for many organizations as well as for the United States and other foreign governments. He has a son who currently lives in West New York.&lt;ref name="F. I. Herzberg, 76, Professor And Management Consultant"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/01/business/f-i-herzberg-76-professor-and-management-consultant.html |title=F. I.

==Motivator-Hygiene Theory==
{{main|Two-factor theory}}

Herzberg proposed the motivator-hygiene theory, also known as the ''[[two-factor theory]]'' of job satisfaction. According to his theory, people are influenced by two sets of factors.

The idea is that hygiene factors will not motivate, but if they are not there, they can lower motivation. These factors could be anything from clean toilets and comfortable chairs, to a reasonable level of pay and job security. The theory deals with satisfaction and dissatisfaction in jobs which are not affected by the same set of needs, but instead occur independently of each other. Herzberg's theory challenged the assumption that "dissatisfaction was a result of an absence of factors giving rise to satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Does Herzberg's motivation theory have staying power? |journal=Journal of Management Development |last1=Bassett-Jones |first1=Nigel |last2=Lloyd |first2=Geoffrey C. |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=929–943 |date=2005 |doi=10.1108/02621710510627064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivational factors will not necessarily lower motivation, but can be responsible for increasing motivation. These factors could involve job recognition, potential for promotion or even the work in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Motivation to Work |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |first1=Frederick |last1=Herzberg |first2=Bernard |last2=Mausner |first3=Barbara B. |last3=Snyderman |edition=2nd |year=1959 |isbn=0-471-37389-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herzberg (1987) describes the growth factors (or ''motivators'') as "achievement, recognition for achievement, the work itself, responsibility, and growth or advancement," which are intrinsic.&lt;ref name="Herzberg1987" /&gt;{{rp|13}} Intrinsic factors include "orientations toward money, recognition, competition, and the dictates of other people, and the latter includes challenge, enjoyment, personal enrichment, interest, and self-determination."&lt;ref name="Stead1972"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Berlo's Communication Process Model as Applied to the Behavioral Theories of Maslow, Herzberg, and McGregor |journal=The Academy of Management Journal |first=Bette Ann |last=Stead |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=389–394 |date=September 1972 |jstor=254868}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hygiene factors (or dissatisfaction-avoidance), which are extrinsic to the job, are "company policy and administration, supervision, interpersonal relationships, working conditions, salary, status, and security".&lt;ref name="Herzberg1987" /&gt;  This extrinsic factor "refers to doing something because it leads to a distinct outcome, something external you expect to receive, and the latter refers to doing something because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable, an internal reward."&lt;ref name="Stead1972" /&gt;

'''Gerard Endenburg''' (born 1933) is a Dutch entrepreneur, who developed the [[Sociocracy|Sociocratic]] Circle Organisation Method (SCM), which is a decision-making method for governing and managing organizations and societies based on [[wikt:equivalence|equivalence]] and draws inspiration from [[cybernetics]]. Endenburg was inspired by the idea of [[sociocracy]] of [[Kees Boeke]].



==Biography==
Endenburg was born in [[Rotterdam]] in 1933.&lt;ref name="Quarter" /&gt; He was a [[Quaker]], and attended a Quaker boarding school, the "Werkplaats Kindergemeenschap" (Children's Community Workshop), where he was influenced by Kees Boeke and his wife Betty Cadbury and the ideas of sociocracy.&lt;ref name="Quarter" /&gt; The school involved students in consensus decision-making.

He became general manager of his family's engineering company, Endenburg Elektrotechniek BV, in the mid-1960s, and in the 1970s started pioneering and applying the sociocratic method of organizing within the company.&lt;ref name="Quarter"&gt;Quarter, J. (2000) ''Beyond the Bottom Line: Socially Innovative Business Owners'', Greenwood Press, p. 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, Endenburg founded the Sociocratic Center Netherlands to develop and implement the sociocratic approach in other organizations, serving as its director.&lt;ref name="Quarter" /&gt; In 1992, Endenburg obtained a doctoral degree from the [[University of Twente]], based on his dissertation "Sociocratie als Sociaal Ontwerp" (later translated and published in English as 'Sociocracy as Social Design').&lt;ref&gt;Endenburg, G. (1998). ''Sociocracy as Social Design''. Delft, Netherlands: Eburon.&lt;/ref&gt; Endenburg was an honorary professor in Organizational Learning at [[Maastricht University]].&lt;ref name="HDM"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mqoVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR18&amp;lpg=PR18&amp;dq=Endenburg+honorary+professor+in+Organizational+Learning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=24RUUapNLX&amp;sig=IdwWW261ORSQ69RuKh72aNjKCLo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivyp6alK7TAhVsCMAKHWgqCOsQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Endenburg%20honorary%20professor%20in%20Organizational%20Learning&amp;f=false |title=The Handbook of Design Management |last=Cooper |first=Rachel |last2=Junginger |first2=Sabine |last3=Lockwood |first3=Thomas |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hoo Ah Kay''' ({{zh|c=胡亞基|p=Hú Yàjī}}; 1816 - 27 March 1880), {{small|[[Order of St Michael and St George|C.M.G]]}}, better known as '''Whampoa''' ({{zh|c=黃埔|p=Huángbù}}), was a Singaporean businessman and community leader. An immigrant to [[Singapore]] from China, he held many high-ranking posts in Singapore, including [[Consul (representative)#Honorary consul|honourable consul]] to Japan, Russia and China.

==Early life==
Hoo Ah Kay (Hu Hsuan-tse{{Sfn|Godley|2002|p=217}}) was born 1816, in [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Whampoa]], near [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (now known as Huangpu district, Guangzhou city) in China.{{Sfn|Godley|2002|p=67}} He immigrated to Singapore in 1830.&lt;ref name="Edu 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learnat.edumall.sg/learnat/slot/u101/singaporerivertrail/sec/G041_Dunman_Sec/pioneers_of_singapore.htm |title=Business Giants from the Singapore River |publisher=Edumall |accessdate=26 May 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially working with his businessman father at food supplier Whampoa and Co., Hoo inherited the establishment after his father died.&lt;ref name="French 1"/&gt;

==Career==
Hoo received the honorific ''Mr. Whampoa'' for his political achievements and contributions to the Singaporean society.{{Sfn|Godley|2002|p=67}} He is cited as both "the first Japanese honorable consul in Singapore" and "the first Chinese consul [in Singapore]", two posts he was given in 1879 and 1877 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;pg=PA681 |page=681 |first=Keat Gin |last=Ooi |title=Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to Timor. R–Z |volume=3 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2004 |isbn=9781576077702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1859, Hoo played a key role in establishing the [[Singapore Botanic Gardens]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/botanic-gardens-gets-pioneer-hoo-ah-kays-artefacts |title=Botanic Gardens gets pioneer Hoo Ah Kay's artefacts |last=Zaccheus |first=Melody |date=2013-10-29 |work=The Straits Times |access-date=2018-08-21 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]). In 1869, he was announced as the first Legislative Council member of Chinese ethnicity by the British,{{Sfn|Godley|2002|p=68}} albeit an unofficial one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vhBMmG9yXgYC&amp;pg=PA57 |last=Corfield |first=Justin |pages=57– |title=Historical Dictionary of Singapore |year=2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810873872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a retail dealer specialising in ships working for the [[British Royal Navy]].&lt;ref name="French 1"/&gt; For a period of time he ran a business supplying ice imported from the United States to Singapore; it folded in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2bMuAQAAIAAJ |title=The eagle in the Lion City: America, Americans and Singapore |first=James Michael |last=Baker |pages=45– |publisher=Landmark Books |year=2005 |isbn=9789814189040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoo was hailed as "one of the most influential Chinese (Cantonese) tycoons in Singapore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6mfCzrbOn80C&amp;pg=PA13 |pages=13– |title=The Japanese in colonial Southeast Asia |last=Takashi |first=Shiraishi |year=1993 |publisher=SEAP |isbn=9780877274025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Order of St Michael and St George]], Class Companion (CMG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RuI9TouoM58C&amp;pg=PA257 |page=257 |title=Studies in the Social History of China and South-East Asia: Essays in Memory of Victor Purcell |year=2010 |first=Nicholas |last=Tarling |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521133746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, he became the first Asian member of the [[Legislative Council of Singapore|Legislative Council]] and within a few years was made an extraordinary member of the [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]], the only Chinese to have held this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uCRUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37 |page=37 |title=The Swiss in Singapore |year=2013 |first= Andreas |last=Zangger |publisher=Didier Millet |isbn=9814385689 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hoo was described as having led a rich and glamorous lifestyle, occasionally organizing elaborate meals, mostly intended for overseas visitors. He would hire many dancers to perform for him, as well as personal servants to fan him, as depicted in an illustration by English painter Edward Cree.&lt;ref name="French 1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nnEqCeicbEC&amp;pg=PA43 |pages=43– |title=The French in Singapore: An Illustrated History (1819–today) |last=Pilon |first=Maxime |publisher=Editions Didier Millet |year=2012 |isbn=9789814260442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also owned a few race horses; one of them reportedly earned him about a hundred thousand dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ob2zM78cLhYC&amp;pg=PA72 |pages=72– |title=Sport in Asian Society: Past and Present |last=Mangan |first=James A. |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780714653426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoo frequently let the public at large visit his residence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYczRd6N5CwC&amp;pg=PA156 |page=156 |title=Singapore in Global History |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |year=2007 |isbn=9789048514373 |first=Derek |last=Thiam }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was depicted as sprawling with lush greenery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SePs8fNILS0C&amp;pg=PA75 |page=75 |title=Singapore: City of Gardens |first=William |last=Warren |publisher=Tuttle |year=2000 |isbn=9789625931555 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being eloquent in the English language, he maintained a Chinese personality, preferring to wear Chinese robes. His son Hoo Ah Yip ({{zh|c=胡亞業|p=Hú Yàyè}}), was educated in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. When his son snipped off his [[Queue (hairstyle)|ponytail]] and converted to Christianity, Hoo Ah Kay was written to have been "outraged".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S2EXN8JTwAEC&amp;pg=PA292 |page=292 |first=P.J. |last=Marshall |title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the British Empire |year=2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521002547 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''JasperReports''' is an [[open-source software|open source]] [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[report]]ing tool that can write to a variety of targets, such as: screen, a printer, into [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[HTML]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], [[OpenDocument|ODT]], [[Comma-separated values]] or [[XML]] files.

It can be used in Java-enabled applications, including [[Java EE]] or [[web application]]s, to generate dynamic content. It reads its instructions from an XML or .jasper file.

''JasperReports'' is part of the [[Lisog]] open source stack initiative.

==Features==
JasperReports is an open source reporting library that can be embedded into any Java application. Features include:
 
* Scriptlets may accompany the report definition,&lt;ref name="jw-09-2002"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2002/jw-0920-opensourceprofile.html|title=Reports made easy with JasperReports|work=JavaWorld.com|author=Erik Swenson|date= 2002-09-20|accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the report definition can invoke at any point to perform additional processing.  The scriptlet is built using Java, and has many hooks that can be invoked before or after stages of the report generation, such as Report, Page, Column or Group.
* Sub-reports&lt;ref name="jspk200701"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.oio.de/public/opensource/JS_01_07_Reporting.pdf | title = Freie Reporting-Tools im Vergleich |author1=Christian Brell |author2=Tobias Kieninger | work = [[Orientations in Objects]]; [[JavaSpektrum]] | date = January 2007 | accessdate = 2007-07-14 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For users with more sophisticated report management requirements, reports designed for JasperReports can be easily imported into the ''JasperServer'' - the interactive report server.

Teodor Danciu began work on JasperReports in June 2001, the [[sf.net]] project was registered in September 2001&lt;ref name="rp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rootprompt.org/article.php3?article=8332|title=An Interview with Teodor Danciu of JasperReports|work=RootPrompt|date=February 16, 2005|accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and JasperReports 0.1.5 was released on November 3, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freshmeat.net/projects/jasperreports/#comment-12052 freshmeat.net: Project details for JasperReports:Comment]&lt;/ref&gt;

JasperReports Version 1.0 was released on July 21, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=35381|title=JasperReports 1.0 released|work=theserverside|accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The code was originally licensed under a copyleft ''JasperReports License''&lt;ref name="rp"/&gt; and later moved to [[LGPL]].

Jaspersoft was originally called Panscopic, and was founded by Al Campa, CEO, and Raj Bhargava, VP of Products in 2001.  Panscopic raised $23M from Doll Capital, Discovery Ventures, Morgenthaler Ventures, and Partech. In 2004 Panscopic teamed up with Teodor Danciu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/can-an-open-source-project-get-acquired-one-just-did/|title=Can an open source project get acquired? One just did.|work=zdnet blogs|date= April 25, 2005|accessdate=2006-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; acquired the intellectual property of JasperReports, and changed the name of the company to Jaspersoft.  Brian Gentile became CEO in 2007.

Jaspersoft provides commercial software around the JasperReports product, and negotiate contracts with software developers that wish to embed the JasperReports engine into a closed source product.

Jaspersoft's main related product is JasperReports Server, a Java EE [[web application]] that provides advanced report server capabilities such as report scheduling and permissions. It is available under an open source license for use in conjunction with open source infrastructure such as [[MySQL]] and [[JBoss]], or a commercial license for enterprise deployments involving commercial databases and application servers.

Jaspersoft is a gold partner with MySQL,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solutions.mysql.com/solutions/partner.php?partner=1102 |title=MySQL AB :: Jaspersoft |date=2006-06-27 |accessdate=2007-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101043646/http://solutions.mysql.com/solutions/partner.php?partner=1102 |archivedate=2007-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and JasperReports was included in the [[PostgreSQL]] distribution ''Bizgres'' version 0.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizgres.org/articles.php?id=9 |title=Bizgres 0.7 Released |date=August 3, 2005 |work=bizgres.org |accessdate=2007-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217065559/http://www.bizgres.org/articles.php?id=9 |archivedate=December 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2005/08/03/postgre_bi/|title=Bizgres gets down to business with open source BI stack|author=Gavin Clarke|work=RegDeveloper|date= 3 August 2005|accessdate=2007-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osdbmigration.org/misc/case_datawarehouse.pdf |author=Jutta Horstmann |title=Migrating to Open Source Databases: The Data Warehouse Case Study |date=November 10, 2005 |accessdate=2007-01-11 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929043853/http://www.osdbmigration.org/misc/case_datawarehouse.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2014, [[TIBCO]] announced it had acquired Jaspersoft for  approximately $185 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tibco.com/company/news/releases/2014/press1341.jsp TIBCO Software Acquires Jaspersoft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501140250/http://www.tibco.com/company/news/releases/2014/press1341.jsp |date=2014-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==JRXML==
JasperReports reports are defined in an XML file format, called JRXML, which can be hand-coded, generated, or designed using a tool. The file format is defined by a [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD) or [[XML schema]] for newer versions, providing limited interoperability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ensode.net/jasperreports_intro.html|title=JasperReports Tutorial/Getting Started Guide|author=David R. Heffelfinger|accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; JRXML files have the filename extension ''.jrxml''.

A ''.jasper'' file is a compiled version of a ''.jrxml'' file. iReport does the compilation on the fly, but the compilation can also get achieved at runtime using the JasperCompileManager class.

== IDE integration ==
Several Java [[Integrated Development Environment|IDE]]s, such as [[NetBeans]], [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] and  [[IBM Websphere Studio Application Developer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/library/techarticles/0411_olivieri/0411_olivieri.html|title=Generating online reports using JasperReports and WebSphere Studio|author=Ricardo Olivieri|work=[[IBM developerWorks]]|date=17 November 2004|accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide instructions for users wishing to integrate JasperReports into a project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jasperforge.org/jaspersoft/opensource/business_intelligence/ireport/ JasperReports Project Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johann Fugger the Elder''' or '''Hans Fugger''' (1 June 1583 - 28 April 1633, [[Telfs]]) was a German businessman, landowner and noble of the [[Fugger]] family&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [[Götz Freiherr von Pölnitz|Götz von Pölnitz]]: ''Die Fugger.'' 6. Auflage. Mohr, Tübingen 1999, {{ISBN|3-16-147013-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. He was Lord of [[Fuggerschloss Babenhausen|Schloss Babenhausen]] and [[Boos, Bavaria|Boos]].

He was one of the sons of [[Jakob III. Fugger]] and his wife Anna [[Ilsung]]&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Heinz Wember: [http://www.heinz-wember.de/gen/fugger/linien.html The Fugger Line]&lt;/ref&gt;. After his father's death in 1598 he managed the lordships of Babenhausen and Boos among others. The Fugger lordships were divided up in 1620 and exchanged among the family shortly afterwards. Johann became lord of Boos whilst his brother Maximilian (1587–1629) became lord of Babenhausen, Johann Herr zu Boos&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [[Franz Herre]]: ''Die Fugger in ihrer Zeit.'' 12. Auflage.

'''John Chuang Tiong Choon''' (born 1948) is a [[Singapore|Singaporean]] business magnate best known as the co-founder of chocolate confectionery organisation Petra Foods, which is allegedly one of the world's biggest cocoa-producing firms. He now serves as the company's Group chief executive officer.

==Early life and education==
John Chuang Tiong Choon&lt;ref name="Petra 1"/&gt; was born 1948 in Singapore.&lt;ref name="Forbes 1"/&gt; He attended the England-based [[University of Liverpool]] and graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in 1973. Two years later in 1975, he completed his Masters in Business Administration course at the Cranfield Business School.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=13590659&amp;ticker=FXB:GR|title=Tiong Choon Chuang|accessdate=29 September 2013|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Chuang co-founded Petra Foods, a manufacturer of cocoa goods, in 1984 with his two brothers Joseph and William.&lt;ref name="Forbes 1"/&gt; Prior to establishing Petra Foods, Chuang tried his hand at other industries. Among others, he served as both the California-based Wardley Development's President and the Independence Bank of California's Vice-President from 1979 to 1983.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg 1"/&gt; On 5 November 2004, Chuang was appointed as Group chief executive officer of Petra Foods.&lt;ref name="Petra 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petrafoods.com/about_leadership.html|title=Leadership|publisher=Petra Foods|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petra Foods now claims to be the third-largest cocoa producer in the world.&lt;ref name="Forbes 2"/&gt;

==Wealth and recognition==
Chuang's net worth in 2011 was an estimated $510 million. That year, [[Forbes]] ranked him as the twenty-fourth richest man in Singapore.&lt;ref name="Forbes 2"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=29 September 2013|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/79/singapore-billionaires-11_John-Chuang_75J3.html|title=#24 John Chuang}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he dropped in ranking to number twenty-seven. In 2013, his net worth was estimated to be $965 million, increasing his rank to number twenty-two.&lt;ref name="Forbes 1"/&gt; Chuang's rise in wealth was attributed to part of Petra Foods being purchased by the Switzerland-based [[Barry Callebaut]] for some $950 million.&lt;ref name="Forbes 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/john-chuang/|title=John Chuang|publisher=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his contributions to the cocoa industry, the title of "Businessman of the Year 2011" was bestowed upon Chuang during the 2012 Singapore Business Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sph.com.sg/pradmin/upload/ijdkrdgg_SBA%202012%20-%20BOY%20-%20John%20Chuang_CEO_Petra%20Foods.pdf|title=John Chuang Tiong Choon|publisher=Singapore Business Awards|accessdate=29 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002032835/http://www.sph.com.sg/pradmin/upload/ijdkrdgg_SBA%202012%20-%20BOY%20-%20John%20Chuang_CEO_Petra%20Foods.pdf|archivedate=2 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9580">The '''McDonalds''' were a wealthy family of [[California]] during the 19th and 20th centuries. Descended from Mark Lindsay McDonald (1833-1917), they built and owned the historic residence "Mableton", also known as the "[[McDonald Mansion]]", in [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]].

Colonel Mark L. McDonald was born in [[Kentucky]] but settled in California during the 1850s. He made his money in road construction, and later in [[property development]] in Santa Rosa. He was married to Ralphine North McDonald (1843-1918), from [[Mississippi]], and among their seven children it was Mark McDonald Jr. (died 1932) who became heir to Mableton. Mark Jr. was also a successful businessman, running a water works and a fruit packing plant. He and his wife Isabelle, ''{{nee}}'' Juilliard (died 1960), made alterations to Mableton during the 1920s. They had three children, including their son Juilliard who died childless in 1946, and his sister Marcia later became the last McDonald heir. Upon Marcia's death in 1971, Mableton passed to the City of Santa Rosa.

Colonel Mark L. McDonald, Sr., a [[Kentucky]] native, came west as captain of a [[wagon train]] in the early 1850s. Trained in engineering, he first built roadways servicing gold and silver mines. His early successes allowed him to buy a seat on the [[Pacific Exchange|San Francisco Stock Exchange]], during which time he joined the ranks of the rich and powerful, including [[George Hearst]], [[Leland Stanford]] and [[Charles Crocker]].&lt;ref name=Tuomey1926&gt;Tuomey, Honoria.

''Santa Rosa: A Nineteenth Century Town''. 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Connor1970&gt;Connor, Ann M. ''Mableton''. 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1860s, McDonald had begun to apply his wealth, influence and entrepreneurial spirit to new business opportunities in [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]]. These included purchase and subdivision of {{convert|160|acre|km2}} of land in what was known as McDonald’s Addition. During the 1870s, the new development flourished and [http://santarosa.about.com/od/neighborhoodslandmarks/ig/McDonald-Ave--in-Santa-Rosa/ McDonald Avenue] became the premier residential street of Santa Rosa. The neighborhood’s popularity was enhanced by a range of amenities including gas and water service, a new streetcar line established by Colonel McDonald, and an extensive tree planting program implemented with the assistance of famed local [[Horticulture|horticulturist]] [[Luther Burbank]].&lt;ref  name=LeBaronetal1985/&gt;&lt;ref name=Connor1970/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Connor, Ann M. ''McDonald Avenue, A Century of Elegance''. 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

McDonald was active in civic affairs and was instrumental in the development of numerous local improvements, including Santa Rosa’s first library, the first steam railroad brought to Santa Rosa and operation of the Santa Rosa Water Works Company, an early private utility. He capitalized and built the nearby reservoir known as [[Lake Ralphine]], which was named for McDonald’s wife. His other business interests included fruit packing plants and drying yards in the area.&lt;ref name=Tuomey1926/&gt;&lt;ref name=Irvine1905/&gt;&lt;ref  name=LeBaronetal1985/&gt;

The McDonalds’ primary residence was in [[San Francisco]] and '''Mableton''', later known and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the '''[[McDonald Mansion]]''', was built as their summer home. The couple had seven children, although two of their daughters (Ralphine and Alice) died during childhood. Those surviving into adulthood included Mark L. McDonald, Jr., Stewart, Mabel, Edith and Florence.&lt;ref name=Connor1970/&gt;

Mark McDonald Jr. married Isabelle Juilliard, and it was they who would eventually own Mableton. Stewart McDonald died of tuberculosis in 1907. Mabel was an accomplished horsewoman who married William H. Hamilton of San Francisco. Edith married wealthy Selah Chamberlain, a socially prominent San Franciscan. Florence was also an excellent horsewoman who married Maxwell McNutt, of San Francisco.&lt;ref name=Tuomey1926/&gt;&lt;ref name=Connor1970/&gt;

Mark L. McDonald Sr. died in 1917 in San Francisco at the age of 84. Following his death, his wife Ralphine resided at Mableton, where she died in 1918 at the age of 75. The couple is buried at the north end of McDonald Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ci.santa-rosa.ca.us/departments/recreationandparks/parks/cityparks/cemetery/Pages/default.aspx Santa Rosa Rural Cemetery]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of the senior McDonalds, the eldest son Mark Jr. and his wife Isabelle eventually became sole owners of Mableton, and made it their primary residence. In his career, Mark Jr. followed the example of his father, and found success running the Santa Rosa Water Works, and the M. L. McDonald Jr. and Co. Fruit Packing plant. He also had extensive holdings in orchard land and other real estate.

Like her husband, Isabelle was a native Californian with family roots dating back to the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]]. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Frederick Juilliard, settled in Santa Rosa. The site of their family home was donated to the city by Isabelle’s father, and survives today as Juilliard Park in downtown Santa Rosa. Isabelle’s privileged upbringing included private East Coast schooling and several years of residence in [[Tuxedo Park, New York]] with her wealthy uncle [[Augustus D. Juilliard]], who was the founder of the [[Juilliard School|Juilliard School of Music]].

By the early 1920s, Mark and Isabelle had begun to extensively remodel Mableton to suit their own tastes. Among the changes they implemented were alterations to the rear of the house, installation of additional bathrooms, and numerous landscape improvements, including a tennis court (now the site of a formal garden). The couple had two children who survived into adulthood: a son, Juilliard, and a daughter, Marcia (a third child, Mark McDonald III, died in infancy).

After Mark L. McDonald, Jr. died in 1932, Isabelle occupied a [[Nob Hill]] apartment in San Francisco as her primary residence. Until her death in 1960, Mableton was once again used mostly as a summer home. Isabelle’s son, Juilliard McDonald, had a successful career and maintained the family’s business interests. Although he was married twice, Juilliard died childless in 1946. Following the death of Isabelle, her daughter Marcia became the last surviving McDonald heir. Like her mother, Marcia chose to make her primary home in a San Francisco apartment. However, she was less inclined to visit Mableton, and allowed the property to fall into disrepair.

When Marcia died in 1971 at the age of 65, the fate of the mansion was uncertain. The terms of Isabelle’s will and trust had dictated that, upon Marcia’s death, Mableton was to be left jointly to the [[University of California]] and [[Stanford University]]. Eventually, the property was offered for sale to the [[Santa Rosa, California|City of Santa Rosa]], and local controversy over possible development plans for the site ensued.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16426">{{Taxation| expanded=International}}
A '''permanent establishment''' ('''PE''') is a fixed place of business which generally gives rise to [[income tax|income]] or [[value-added tax]] liability in a particular jurisdiction. The term is defined in many income [[tax treaties]] and in most [[European Union Value Added Tax]] systems. The tax systems in some civil-law countries impose income taxes and value-added taxes only where an enterprise maintains a PE in the country concerned.&lt;ref&gt;
For example, Germany taxes non-German companies only on income from a PE.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions of PEs under tax law or tax treaties may contain specific inclusions or exclusions.

== History ==
The concept of permanent establishment emerged in the German Empire after 1845, culminating with the German Double Taxation Act of 1909.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511977855.005|title = History of tax treaties and the permanent establishment concept|last = Kobetsky|first = Michael|pages = 106–151|doi = 10.1017/cbo9780511977855.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the objective was to prevent double taxation between Prussian municipalities and this was extended to the entire German federation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1889, the first bilateral tax treaty, including the concept of permanent establishment, was concluded between the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and [[Prussia]], marking the first time the concept was used in international tax law.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After years of preparatory works, in 1928, the [[League of Nations]] developed a model to tackle cross-border double taxation and to counter tax evasion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since then, an extensive network of bilateral tax treaty was gradually established, particularly through the influence of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Model Tax Convention,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; where this concept persisted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Types ==
In the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Model Tax Convention, essentially three types of PEs can be construed:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* A '''fixed place of business''' permanent establishment (article 5(1));
* A '''construction or project''' permanent establishment, which is a special subset of the fixed place of business permanent establishment, with different requirements (article 5(3)); and
* An '''agency''' permanent establishment, through the actions of a dependent agent (article 5(5-6)).
The [[United Nations|UN]] Model Tax Convention, which gives greater consideration to developing countries, adds what is known by '''service''' permanent establishment in article 5(3)b.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.un.org/esa/ffd/documents/UN_Model_2011_Update.pdf|title = UN Model Tax Convention (2011)|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, have been trying to extend the concept of service PE into a '''virtual service''' PE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ey.com/GL/en/Services/Tax/International-Tax/Alert--Saudi-Arabian-tax-authorities-introduce-Virtual-Service-PE-concept|title = Saudi Arabian tax authorities introduce Virtual Service PE concept|website = www.ey.com|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Base erosion and profit shifting|Base Erosion and Profit Shifting]] project being developed by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and endorsed by the [[G-20 major economies|G20]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps-about.htm|title = About Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) - OECD|website = www.oecd.org|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new nexus based on '''significant digital presence''' is being considered under Action 1, aimed at ''Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264241046-en|title = OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy, Action 1 - 2015 Final Report|last = OECD|doi = 10.1787/9789264241046-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fixed place of business==
The starting point for determination if a permanent establishment exists is generally a fixed place of business. The definition of permanent establishment in article 5 of the [[OECD]] Model Income Tax Treaty&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Article 5 and Commentary|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is followed in most income tax treaties.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the [http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/tax-policy/library/uktreaty.pdf U.S./UK treaty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527220749/http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/tax-policy/library/uktreaty.pdf |date=2010-05-27 }} Article 5, which is virtually identical to the OECD Model Article 5.  The [http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=87999 Nigeria/South Africa treaty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629124238/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=87999 |date=2011-06-29 }} Article 5, is nearly identical to the OECD Model Article 5, with the addition of a provision clarifying that a fixed place of business used as a sales outlet is a PE, notwithstanding exclusions elsewhere in the article.&lt;/ref&gt;

The commentary indicates that a fixed place of business has three components:
*'''Fixed''' refers to a link between the place of business and a specific geographic point, as well as a degree of permanence with respect to the taxpayer.  An ''"office hotel"'' may constitute a fixed place for a business for an enterprise that regularly uses different offices within the space.  By contrast, where there is no commercial coherence, the fact that activities may be conducted within a limited geographic area should not result in that area being considered a fixed place of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Commentary 5-6 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A '''place''' of business.  This refers to some facilities used by an enterprise for carrying out its business.  The premises must be at the disposal of the enterprise.  The mere presence of the enterprise at that place does not necessarily mean that it is a place of business of the enterprise.  The facilities need not be the exclusive location, and they need not be used exclusively by that enterprise or for that business.  However, the facilities must be those of the taxpayer, not another unrelated person.  Thus, regular use of a customer's premises does not generally constitute a place of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Commentary 4 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Business''' of the enterprise must be carried on wholly or partly at the fixed place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Commentary 7 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements of what constitutes a ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'permanent establishment''' within the scope of a particular treaty depend on what interpretation a particular country places on that term, in context of the text of that treaty. As per Article 3 of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], no one is entitled to claim rights under a particular treaty unless otherwise authorised by the contracting state. Therefore, if a particular contracting state places a different meaning on the term 'permanent establishment' than what the taxpayer seeks to place, the taxpayer would be left with virtually no remedy within that state, other than  to seek a mutual agreement to that dispute with the other contracting state to that treaty.

==Indicative list of permanent establishments==
The OECD Model Tax Convention includes a short indicative list of ''prima facie'' permanent establishments. These, however, are not automatically permanent establishments as the requirements set out, namely, for fixed place of business permanent establishment must be met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Commentary 12 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en|quote=This paragraph contains a list, by no means exhaustive, of examples, each of which can be regarded, prima facie, as constituting a permanent establishment. As these examples are to be seen against the background of the general definition given in paragraph 1, it is assumed that the Contracting States interpret the terms listed, “a place of management”, “a branch”, “an office”, etc. in such a way that such places of business constitute permanent establishments only if they meet the requirements of paragraph 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list is as follows:
* A [[branch (business)|branch]]
* A [[warehouse]] (but see excluded places below)
* A [[factory]]
* A [[mining|mine]] or place of extraction of natural resources
* A place of [[management]]

==Specifically excluded places==
Many treaties explicitly exclude from the definition of PE places where certain activities are conducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title = Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version, Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last = OECD|at = Article 4 and Commentary thereon|doi = 10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, these exclusions do not apply if non-excluded activities are conducted at the fixed place of business. Among the excluded activities are:
*Ancillary or preparatory activities
*The use of a storage facility solely for delivery of goods to customers
*The maintenance of a stock of goods owned by the enterprise solely for purposes of processing by another enterprise (sometimes referred to as toll processing)
*Purchasing or information gathering activities

==Other specific provisions==

=== Construction or Project PE ===
Many treaties provide specific rules with respect to construction sites.  Under those treaties, a building site or construction or installation project constitutes a PE only if it lasts more than a specified length of time. The amount of time varies by treaty.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [http://www.fin.gc.ca/treaties-conventions/Belgium_-eng.asp Canada/Belgium treaty] sets this limit as 12 months, as does the OECD Model.  By contrast, the [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/india.pdf US/India treaty] treats such a site, project or activities continuing for more than 120 days in any twelve-month period as a PE.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agency PE ===
In addition, the activities of a dependent agent&lt;ref&gt;See [[Agency (law)]] for a discussion of the essential characteristics of agent and principal.&lt;/ref&gt; may give rise to a PE for the principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Paragraph 5 of Article 5 and Commentary 31 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dependent agents may include employees or others under the control of the principal.  A company is generally not considered an agent solely by reason of ownership of the agent company by the principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Paragraph 7 of Article 5 and Commentary 40-41 to Article 5|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, activities of an independent agent generally are not attributed to the principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/model-tax-convention-on-income-and-on-capital-condensed-version-2014_mtc_cond-2014-en|title=Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital: Condensed Version 2014|last=OECD|at=Paragraph 6 to Article 5 and Commentary 36-39|doi=10.1787/mtc_cond-2014-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service PE ===
Some treaties deem a PE to exist for an enterprise of one country performing services in the other country for more than a specified length of time&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the [http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan002084.pdf United Nations Model Tax Convention] Article 5 paragraph 3(b).&lt;/ref&gt; or for a related enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., the US/India treaty, ''supra''., Article 5 paragraph 2(l).&lt;/ref&gt;

== BEPS Action 7 and 15 ==
In October 2015, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] released the final reports on the [[Base erosion and profit shifting|Base Erosion and Profit Shifting]] (BEPS) project. Action 7 was targeted at ''Preventing the Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status'' and proposes a large number of changes that are set to be included in the next version of the OECD Model Tax Convention. The OECD expects many of these changes to be applied to currently existing tax treaties through the work based on Action 15 on ''Developing a Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264241688-en|title = OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, Developing a Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties, Action 15 - 2015 Final Report|last = OECD|doi = 10.1787/9789264241688-en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of countries are involved in the negotiations that are expected to be concluded by the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/multilateral-instrument-for-beps-tax-treaty-measures-the-ad-hoc-group.htm|title = Multilateral instrument for BEPS tax treaty measures: the Ad hoc Group - OECD|website = www.oecd.org|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final report on Action 7 proposes substantial changes to the definition of Agency PE and stricter requirements to the exclusions provision:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oecd.org/tax/preventing-the-artificial-avoidance-of-permanent-establishment-status-action-7-2015-final-report-9789264241220-en.htm|title = Preventing the Artificial Avoidance of Permanent Establishment Status, Action 7 - 2015 Final Report - en - OECD|website = www.oecd.org|access-date = 2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"These changes will ensure that where the activities that an intermediary exercises in a country are intended to result in the regular conclusion of contracts to be performed by a foreign enterprise, that enterprise will be considered to have a taxable presence in that country unless the intermediary is performing these activities in the course of an independent business. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The changes will also restrict the application of a number of exceptions to the definition of permanent establishment to activities that are preparatory or auxiliary nature and will ensure that it is not possible to take advantage of these exceptions by the fragmentation of a cohesive operating business into several small operations; they will also address situations where the exception applicable to construction sites is circumvented through the splitting-up contracts between closely related enterprises."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''plan''' is typically any diagram or list of steps with details of timing and resources, used to achieve an [[Goal|objective]] to do something. See also [[strategy]]. It is commonly understood as a [[modal logic|temporal]] [[set (mathematics)|set]] of intended actions through which one expects to achieve a [[goal]].

For [[space|spatial]] or [[Plane (geometry)|planar]] [[topology|topologic]] or [[topography|topographic]] sets see [[map]].
  
Plans can be formal or informal:
* Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur in [[project]]s, [[diplomacy]], [[career]]s, [[economic development]], [[military]] campaigns, [[combat]], [[sports]], [[games]], or in the conduct of other [[business]]. In most cases, the absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for example, a non-robust project plan can cost the organization time and money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pmhut.com/what-should-be-included-in-a-project-plan |title=What Should Be Included in a Project Plan |accessdate=December 18, 2009 |website=www.pmhut.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/paperpdf/Value%20of%20Formal%20Planning.pdf | title = The Value of Formal Planning for Strategic Decisions: A Reply | author = J. Scott Armstrong | journal = Strategic Management Journal | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–185| year = 1986 | doi=10.1002/smj.4250070207}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Informal or [[ad hoc]] plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits.

The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one another. For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories.

It is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use. More formal plans as used for business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an abstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space. This allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan.

==Topics==

===Planning===
The term [[planning]] implies the working out of sub-components in some degree of elaborate detail. Broader-brush enunciations of objectives may qualify as metaphorical [[Technology roadmap|roadmap]]s. Planning literally just means the creation of a plan; it can be as simple as making a [[task list|list]]. It has acquired a technical meaning, however, to cover the area of [[government]] [[legislation]] and [[regulation]]s elated to the use of resources.

Planning can refer to the planned use of any and all resources, as in the succession of [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plan]]s through which the government of the [[Soviet Union]] sought to develop the country. However, the term is most frequently used in relation to planning for the use of land and related resources, for example in [[urban planning]], [[transportation planning]], etc.

[[transportation planning|ión  planning]], etc.

In a governmental context, "planning" without any qualification is most likely to mean the regulation of [[land use]]. See also [[zoning]].

===Planners===
Planners are the professionals that have the requisite training to take or make decisions that will help or balance the society in order to have a functional, aesthetic, and convenient environment.

===Methodology===
Concepts such as [[top-down planning]] (as opposed to bottom-up planning) reveal similarities with the [[systems thinking]] behind the [[top-down model]].

The subject touches such broad fields as [[psychology]], [[game theory]], [[communication]]s and [[information theory]], which inform the planning methods that people seek to use and refine; as well as [[logic]] and [[science]] (i.e. methodological naturalism) which serve as a means of testing different parts of a plan for reliability or consistency.

The specific methods used to create and refine plans depend on who is to make it, who is to put it to use, and what resources are available for the task. The methods used by an [[individual]] in his or her [[mind]] or [[personal organizer]], may be very different from the collection of planning techniques found in a [[corporation|corporate]] board-room, and the planning done by a [[project manager]] has different priorities and uses different tools to the planning done by an [[engineer]] or [[industrial designer]].

==Examples of plans==
* [[Architectural plan]]
* [[Business plan]]
* [[Fragplan]]
* [[Flight Plan]]
* [[Health plan]]
* [[Marketing plan]]
* [[Project plan]]
* [[Plan de Ayala]]
* [[Plan de Casa Mata]]
* [[Treaty of Córdoba|Plan de Córdoba]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7841">'''Play value''' is the essential value of a [[toy]] or [[game]] for [[Play (activity)|play]].
The term is frequently employed in the field of [[child development]] and playwork for the assessment of toys, games, equipment and spaces.  When they are fun and engaging, playthings and spaces are said to have play value; those that are quickly discarded or are considered uninteresting do not. In short, objects of play must be compelling and encourage the child's involvement in order to have true play value.  Play value has been defined as 'how much play can you get out of something'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Shelly Newstead |title=The Buskers Guide to Playwork |publisher=[http://www.commonthreads.org.uk Common Threads Publications Ltd] |year=2004 |isbn=1-904792-13-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classic toys are examples of toys with true play value as they continue to provide new discoveries 
and adventures in each subsequent session of play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=FAO Schwarz Toys For A Lifetime: Enhancing Childhood Through Play |publisher=Stevanne Auerbach |year=1999 |isbn=0-7893-0355-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment of play value in the selection of toys and games ==
The selection of toys and games has long been a concern to parents and educators. Many fail to 
sufficiently engage children.  [[Stevanne Auerbach]] emphasizes that products should last as long
as possible and have many different and long lasting uses.  Good examples of toys with
high play value are [[Toy block|blocks]], [[Construction set|construction toys]] and [[yo-yo]]s.  The toy should have clear
instructions so the parent and child are guided to its best use by the designer and
manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Dr. Toy's Smart Play Smart Toys (How To Raise A Child With a High PQ (Play Quotient)) |publisher=Stevanne Auerbach |year=2004 |isbn=0-9785540-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In playwork terms it is the child who determines the play value of an object rather than adults or instruction manuals

== Multiple uses ==

Toys tend to have high play value when they may be used, engaged and employed in manifold ways. 
A good example is [[Lego|Lego bricks]] which may be assembled and connected in myriad ways to
make cars, trucks, planes, trains, etc. 
Another good example is [[polymer clay]] which may be used for sculpting hand-shaped items,
such as beads, jewelry, and charms.

== Self-directed play ==
Children need to be in charge of their own play activity. According to PBS' '''The Whole Child''' Web site
when adults plan the play activity and structure the outcome of playtime it is far less effective than if children have the freedom to form their own ideas, practice skills and use playthings at their own speed. [[Cardboard box|Cardboard box toys]] are an example of playthings which allow children to
use their own imaginations.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wholechild/providers/play.html PBS - The Whole Child: ABC's of Child Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appeal to more than one age or stage of development ==
Playability is a word that when applied to games has a similar meaning to play value. Those games with strong playability appeal to more than one age or stage of development.  For example, [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] and [[Risk]]
are two games that appeal to a wide range of ages, though generally not to very young children. Similarly, toys that appeal to more than one age or stage tend to have higher play value.

== Inverse relationship with linkage to TV, movies and video games ==
Authors Nancy Carlsson-Paige &amp; Diane Levin&lt;ref name=carlsson_paige_levin&gt;[http://www.parentingbookmark.com/pages/NCP03.htm Nancy Carlsson-Paige &amp; Diane Levin]&lt;/ref&gt; note that play value in toys can be seen as inversely related to their degree of linkage with TV, movies and video games.
For example, [[G.I. Joe]], [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]], and [[Power Rangers]]
are all examples of toys that have cross-feeds with television shows that have violent themes.
Similarly, [[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]], [[Small Soldiers]], [[Spawn (film)|Spawn]], [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]] and [[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]
toys are marketed to children 4 and up.

== Complement or supplement other play activities ==
[[Personal computer game|Computer games]] or electronic toys are examples of toys that can complement or supplement other play
activities.  According to author Cathrine Neilsen-Hewett,&lt;ref name=neilsen_hewett&gt;[http://www.earlylearningcentre.com.au/Store/members/parent009.aspx Cathrine Neilsen-Hewett]&lt;/ref&gt; while often stimulating, engaging and fun, these toys should never become a substitute for traditional play activities such as drawing, pretending, or block building. Instead, electronic games are best thought of as adding to or reinforcing other kinds of play, and are not a suitable replacement for parental
interaction and attention.
[[File:Children marbles.jpg|thumb|Children playing with marbles]]

== Stay with children as they develop ==
Classic toys such as [[Mr. Potato Head]], the [[Radio Flyer (company)|Radio
Flyer wagon]] and [[Snakes and ladders|Chutes and Ladders]] or in a general sense, spanning generations, the [[teddy bear]], stay with a child as he or she develops new interests and matures. They "stand the test of time", and evolved can accompany a child into more and more elaborate play when social surroundings, life and a knowledge of history (for example) create diversified and extended ideas.

Organized toy kingdoms can grow up in the rooms of European children. Named [[stuffed animal]]s or [[doll]]s often occupy lifelong positions of honor, as visualized [[imaginary friend]]s, in the lifetimes of sociable people with many real friends.

== Promote respectful interaction ==
Toys have greater play value that promote respectful, non-violent and non-stereotyped interaction 
among children.  For example, [[Barbie]] is an example of a toy that reinforces [[Gender role|gender stereotypes]] for girls
despite its status as a classic toy.

== Useful for further learning ==
Play value from a child development perspective is enhanced by toys and games that help children develop skills useful
for further learning and mastery such as [[Scrabble]] and [[The Game of Life]] &lt;ref name=truce&gt;[http://www.truceteachers.org/toyactionguide.html#choosing TRUCE]&lt;/ref&gt; In playwork terms - play value is the individual child's subjective assessment of the space and the equipment available to them, rather than a pre-conceived adult idea about what sorts of play are 'valuable'. 'Play value' and 'the value of play' are two separate judgements in playwork - the former chiefly made by children, and the latter chiefly made by adults.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17581">[[Image:PullmanSquare.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Pullman Square, the centerpiece of Huntington's urban renewal efforts.]]

'''Pullman Square''' is a [[Lifestyle center (retail)|lifestyle center]] in downtown [[Huntington, West Virginia]], United States between 8th and 10th Street and 3rd Avenue and Veteran's Memorial Boulevard. It is located on what was known as the '''[[Cityscape of Huntington, West Virginia#Urban renewal|Superblock]]''',&lt;ref name="HD_022299"&gt;{{cite news | last=Ross | first=Jim |title=Chi-Chi's not interested in moving | publisher=''Herald-Dispatch'' | date=1999-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a large [[urban renewal]] project that saw the demolishing of four city-square-blocks in 1970.&lt;ref name="HD_101900"&gt;{{ cite news | last=Wellman | first=Dave |title=Officials hope decades of flops are over | publisher=''Herald-Dispatch'' | date=2000-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Superblock ===
The Superblock was to be a large revitalizaion project in downtown Huntington.&lt;ref name="HD_022299"/&gt; In 1970,&lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt; a four-block {{convert|9|acre|m2|adj=on}} vacant site was created for the next "large development"; however, problems besieged the area for decades. In 1974, a master plan was developed for the vacant site.&lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt;

In 1977, the [[Big Sandy Superstore Arena|Huntington Civic Arena]] was constructed on one parcel. One year later, a group of entrepreneurs wanted to construct a 350-room hotel and retail stores; however, the plan died by 1980.&lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt; In 1983, the ''National Shamrock Development and Investment Company'' wanted to develop the property and took a two-year lease on the project. By mid-1985, however, the lease ran out and the developers could not receive financial backing due to the failure in their $15 million ''Urban Development Action Grant'' request.

In the spring of 1986, the ''Huntington Development Corporation'' suggested that an off-track betting facility be constructed; however, the idea died after Governor [[Arch A. Moore, Jr.|Arch Moore]] vetoed an off-track betting bill that was critical to the project's success.&lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt; In 1987, the ''Webb Companies'' presented a plan for a $110 million mixed-use complex called '''''RiverCenter''''' that would feature a 20-story office tower, an underground parking garage and a [[skywalk|skyway]] to the [[Harris Riverfront Park]].&lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt; The project failed when two large tenants could not be found to anchor the project. In 1988, the city's grant to help develop the project was revoked.

Another instance included an [[outlet mall]] proposal that was announced on May 6, 1987; however, two months later, the [[Herald-Dispatch]] reported that the project was "dead" and that the "13-year history of failure haunts (the) Superblock." &lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt; Another proposal, on April 28, 1989 reported on a development that was "on tap," followed by an article several years later that stated, "super development dream fails to become reality." In 1992, a two-story shopping center was proposed but the idea failed to receive tenant support.&lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt;

A [[Chi-Chi's]] Mexican restaurant was constructed on the corner of 3rd Avenue and 10th Street in 1991.&lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt; These developments were mostly suburban in nature and was not conductive to improvements in downtown Huntington. A [[Holiday Inn]] was constructed adjacent to the Big Sandy Superstore Arena between 8th and 9th Street in 1998.&lt;ref name="HD_101900"/&gt;

=== Intermodal facility ===
In 1998, $27 million for an intermodal facility was appropriated from [[United States Congress|Congress]]; an additional $6.7 million came from state and local funding.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. "New facility could alter downtown." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 19 Feb. 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Then Governor [[Cecil Underwood]] had promised $700,000 in 1999, with local lawmakers funding the additional $1.3 million;&lt;ref name="HD_052299"&gt;"Huntington given more cash." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 22 May 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; an additional $4 million was to be allocated from the state over the next two years.

The proposed facility was for a [[Tri-State Transit Authority]] (TTA) bus transfer station, retail development and associated parking structures and would occupy a two-block surface parking lot between 8th Street and 10th Street along 3rd Avenue. A later study by ''Woolpert'' suggested at least {{convert|150000|sqft|m2|-3|abbr=on}} of retail and a parking structure that has 800 to 1,400 spaces.  Yet another study suggested that retail, entertainment, dining, housing, cultural, and educational aspects be included in the project.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Joseph. "Superblock a key component." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 28 March 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A ground breaking ceremony was planned in early 2000 with initial completion of the project in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, Edward. "Cash crunch hinders Superblock." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 18 Feb. 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to complete the ''Superblock'', Chi-Chi's would need to be evicted; however, it was granted and opportunity to have a restaurant within the proposed development.&lt;ref name="HD_022299"/&gt; Chi-Chi's refused to leave the ''Superblock'', however, citing that they wanted to "upgrade and remodel" the restaurant.

In 1999, [[Robert C. Byrd]] allocated $8 million to federal appropriation bills for the ''Superblock'' project.&lt;ref name="HD_052299"/&gt; Another $400,000 was allocated from the [[Federal Transit Administration]] to the ''Huntington Transit Authority'' for the feasibility study and master plan for the intermodal facility.

=== Pullman Square ===
On September 30, 1999, it was announced that the ''Huntington Urban Renewal Authority'' was in negotiations with the ''Transit Authority'' and an unnamed [[Columbus, Ohio]] developer for the Superblock.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, Edward. "Superblock progressing, chief says." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 1 Oct. 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In early October, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the ''Transportation Appropriations'' bill, which provided an additional $12 million in funds for the intermodal facility.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, Edward. "Superblock." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 16 Oct. 1999. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2000, ''Steiner + Associates'' (dropped in favor of ''Metropolitan Partners'' with the same developers), a Columbus, Ohio developer that specializes in recreating downtown urban environments, announced a $60 million {{convert|200000|sqft|m2|-4|abbr=on}}. retail and entertainment complex between 10th streets and 3rd Avenue and Veterans Memorial Boulevard that would resemble an "old-time small town" and would fit within the "historic context of the existing downtown." &lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. "Developer unveils plans for $60 million complex." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington], Oct. 19, 2000. March 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. "Superblock plans revealed today." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 18 Oct. 2000. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The developers had previously constructed similar developments in [[Newport, Kentucky]] with the completion of [[Newport on the Levee]] and [[Easton Town Center]] in Columbus. The project would include stores, restaurants and a 12 to 16-screen movie theater and would open in fall of 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Tarbett, Jean. "Shoppers." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 19 Oct. 2000. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Two parking structures would be constructed as well. The parking structure between 8th and 9th Street would be four-levels and include 940 parking spaces, but could be expanded upward to include an office tower; the parking structure between 9th and 10th Streets would be three-levels and include the movie complex on top.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. "Developer unveils plans for $60 million complex." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 19 Oct. 2000. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Broken down, the project plan included,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title="Development Program/Merchandising Mix" | publisher=''Pullman Square'' | url=http://www.pullman-square.com/program.html | date=2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030628034619/http://www.pullman-square.com/program.html |archivedate=2003-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{convert|65000|sqft|m2|-2|abbr=on}} of retail,
* {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|-3|abbr=on}} of restaurants,
* 25,300 sq, ft. of office space,
* {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|-2|abbr=on}} of entertainment, and 
* a 2,300-seat, {{convert|50000|sqft|m2|-3|abbr=on}} theater.

The plan included narrowing 3rd Avenue from four-lanes westbound towards the [[Robert C. Byrd Bridge]] to one lane in each direction with angled parking; however, this was later revised to one-lane in each direction with parallel parking and a center variable lane.&lt;ref&gt;Gorczyca, Beth. "Before it gets spiffy, 3rd will be messy." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 19 Oct. 2000. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The road narrowing plan was envisioned as a [[traffic calming]] measure.

In January 2002, the ''Huntington Urban Renewal Authority'' began [[eminent domain]] proceedings against ''Chi-Chi's''.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. "Schedule tightens on Pullman." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 24 Jan. 2002. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The parent company of ''Chi-Chi's'', ''Prandium Inc.'', had refused to sell the property and rejected the city's final offer on October 19, 2000 and refused all negotiations and communications with the ''Authority'' and with ''Metropolitan Partners''. In March, ''Prandium Inc.'' refused an offer of $975,000 for the property plus $200,000 in relocation costs, which was over the appraised value of the property.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. "Chi-Chi's." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 9 March 2002. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The company requested a sale price of $2 million instead.  The company, however, went into [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy reorganization in March. In May, ''Chi-Chi's'' wanted to sell the property for $1.15 million, including undisclosed costs for relocation and loss of business,&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. "Chi-Chi's." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 2 May 2002. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but later reversed out of the deal and wanted $1.75 million.&lt;ref name="HD_032703"&gt;Ross, Jim. "Superblock land sold to Pullman Square developers." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 27 March 2003. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

During November 2002, ''Metropolitan Partners'' filed a grant request to the ''West Virginia Economic Development Grant Committee''.&lt;ref name="HD_032703"/&gt; It received $10.6 million in infrastructure improvements.&lt;ref name="HD_100503"&gt;Ross, Jim. "Development in limbo." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 5 Oct., 2003. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A lawsuit was later filed by the [[Jackson County, West Virginia]] lawyer Larry Harless, questioning the legality of the committee and its work. Eventually, the [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia]] nullified the grant process and the grants that were given.

On March 26, 2003, the ''Superblock'' was sold to the developers of ''Pullman Square'', ''Metropolitan Partners''.&lt;ref name="HD_032703"/&gt; Chi-Chi's had until April 15 to vacate; it was demolished on the 29th.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Jim. "Demolition makes way for Pullman." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 30 April 2003. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening date had been pushed back from spring to summer 2004 due to a court case that was being considered by the [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia|West Virginia Supreme Court]]. In July 2003, the [[West Virginia Legislature]] passed legislation that withstood the ''Court of Appeals''; however, the ''Pullman Square'' project had to be re-approved by the reconstituted grant committee.&lt;ref name="HD_071303"&gt;{{cite news | last=Cantley-Falk | first=Rebeccah | title=Work to begin Monday at Pullman site | publisher=''Herald-Dispatch'' | date=2003-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The grant money was once again awarded in August;&lt;ref name="HD_100503"/&gt; however, two citizens' lawsuits by Larry Harless once again disputed the process. In their case, they stated that the state may provide loans to the projects but not to the grants, and questioned the legality of the [[West Virginia Lottery|state's]] video lottery. The ''West Virginia Economic Development Grant Committee'' was to finance the grants by selling bonds which would be repaid from profits on video lottery.

On October 17, 2003, the state Supreme Court ruled that the state could proceed with the sale of bonds financing ''Pullman Square'' and 48 other projects throughout the state.&lt;ref&gt;"Ruling clears way for local projects." Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] 18 Oct., 2003. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction and opening===
Construction began on Pullman Square on July 16, 2004 with the excavation of the parking lot for the parking structures.&lt;ref name="HD_071303"/&gt; It opened on November 19, 2004 with [[Marquee Cinemas]].&lt;ref name="HD_112004"&gt;{{cite news| title="TODAY'S SPOTLIGHT: PULLMAN SQUARE" | author=Chambers, Bryan | date=2004-11-20 | publisher=[[The Herald-Dispatch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Empire Books &amp; News, [[EB Games]] and [[Starbucks]], opened in early December.&lt;ref name="HD_061605"&gt;"Pullman progress." ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] 16 June 2005. 2 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005, the Funny Bone Comedy Club opened, followed by [[Cold Stone Creamery]] in July and pizzeria [[Uno Chicago Grill]] and [[Max &amp; Erma's]] in August.

A few months after opening, the [[Uno Chicago Grill]] was sued for not paying the builders, suppliers, and utilities.&lt;ref name="HD_061607"/&gt; It soon changed its name to La Sha's [[West Virginia Lottery|West Virginia]] Bistro and was headed by [[Powerball]] winner [[Jack Whittaker (lottery winner)|Jack Whittaker]]; however, it closed on February 22, 2007 after another lawsuit was filed after Metropolitan Huntington LLC complained that the ''Bistro'' owed thousands for rent.&lt;ref name="HD_061607"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HD_022207"&gt;{{cite news |first= Tarbett |last= Hardiman |title= Bistro closes doors at Pullman Square |work= Herald-Dispatch [Huntington] |date= 2007-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edible Arrangements]] was announced on August 5, 2006. The retail store, specializing in fruit bouquets and designer arrangements of fruit, opened in the fall.&lt;ref name="HD_080506"&gt;{{cite news |first= Justin |last= McElroy |title= New store set to open at Pullman |work= [[The Herald-Dispatch]] |date= 2006-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, on January 11, 2007, [[Moe's Southwest Grill]] closed for remodeling.&lt;ref name="HD_011207"&gt;{{cite news |title= Two downtown restaurants unexpectedly close |work= ''Herald-Dispatch'' [Huntington] |date= 2007-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The quick-casual restaurant later reluctantly announced that it was, in fact, moving to a nearby location on 9th Street.  On March 17 Runway Couture opened next to Inspired, featuring west coast-inspired fashions; both are owned by Deneene Chafin.  Moe's Southwest Grill maintained goodfaith talks with Pullman Square and after protracted negotiations Metropolitan Partners agreed to Moe's corporate lease arrangements and subsequently surrendered the keys to the former location on November 5, 2007.

On May 8, 2008, it was announced that Community Trust Bank would locate a bank branch at the corner of 3rd Avenue and 10th Street.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1435">The term '''regulatory state''' refers to the expansion in the use of rule making, monitoring and enforcement techniques and institutions by the state and to a parallel change in the way its positive functions in society are being carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Levi-Faur, David, [http://regulation.huji.ac.il/papers/jp39.pdf "The Odyssey of the Regulatory State – Episode One: The Rescue of the Welfare State"], Jerusalem Papers in Regulation &amp; Governance, Paper No. 39, November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of the state nowadays is generally via [[regulation]] and less via taxing and spending.&lt;ref&gt;Giandomenico Majone (1997).

Journal of Public Policy, 17, pp 139-167 doi:10.1017/S0143814X00003524&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of the regulatory state is increasingly more attractive for [[Theoretician (Marxism)|theoreticians]] of the state with the growth in the use and application of rule making, monitoring and enforcement strategies and with the parallel growth of civil regulation and business regulation. The co-expansion of state, civil and business regulation at the domestic and the transnational arenas suggests that the notions of regulatory [[governance]] and [[regulatory capitalism]] are as usefully theoretically as the notion of regulatory state.

In [[economics]], '''returns to scale''' and '''[[economies of scale]]''' are related but different terms that describe what happens as the scale of production increases in the long run, when all [[factor of production|input]] levels including physical [[capital (economics)|capital]] usage are variable (chosen by the [[Theory of the firm|firm]]). The term returns to scale arises in the context of a firm's [[production function]].  It explains the behavior of the rate of increase in output (production) relative to the associated increase in the inputs (the factors of production) in the long run. In the long run all factors of production are variable and subject to change due to a given increase in size (scale). While economies of scale show the effect of an increased output level on unit costs, returns to scale focus only on the relation between input and output quantities.

The laws of returns to scale are a set of three interrelated and sequential laws:
Law of Increasing Returns to Scale,
Law of Constant Returns to Scale,
and Law of Diminishing Returns to Scale.
If output increases by that same proportional change as all inputs change then there are '''constant returns to scale''' (CRS). If output increases by less than that proportional change in inputs, there are '''decreasing returns to scale''' (DRS). If output increases by more than the proportional change in inputs, there are '''increasing returns to scale''' (IRS). A firm's production function could exhibit different types of returns to scale in different ranges of output.  Typically, there could be increasing returns at relatively low output levels, decreasing returns at relatively high output levels, and constant returns at one output level between those ranges.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In mainstream microeconomics, the returns to scale faced by a firm are purely technologically imposed and are not influenced by economic decisions or by market conditions (i.e., conclusions about returns to scale are derived from the specific mathematical structure of the production function ''in isolation'').

==Example==

When the usages of all inputs increase by a factor of 2, new values for output will be:

* Twice the previous output if there are constant returns to scale (CRS)
* Less than twice the previous output if there are decreasing returns to scale (DRS)
* More than twice the previous output if there are increasing returns to scale (IRS)

Assuming that the factor costs are constant (that is, that the firm is a perfect competitor in all input markets) and the production function is homothetic, a firm experiencing constant returns will have constant [[cost curve|long-run average costs]], a firm experiencing decreasing returns will have increasing long-run average costs, and a firm experiencing increasing returns will have decreasing long-run average costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gelles |first=Gregory M. |last2=Mitchell |first2=Douglas W. |title=Returns to scale and economies of scale: Further observations |journal=[[Journal of Economic Education]] |volume=27 |year=1996 |issue=3 |pages=259–261 |jstor=1183297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frisch |first=R. |title=Theory of Production |location=Dordrecht |publisher=D. Reidel |year=1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=C. E. |title=The Neoclassical Theory of Production and Distribution |location=London |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1969 |isbn=0-521-07453-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this relationship breaks down if the firm does not face perfectly competitive factor markets (i.e., in this context, the price one pays for a good does depend on the amount purchased). For example, if there are increasing returns to scale in some range of output levels, but the firm is so big in one or more input markets that increasing its purchases of an input drives up the input's per-unit cost, then the firm could have diseconomies of scale in that range of output levels. Conversely, if the firm is able to get bulk discounts of an input, then it could have economies of scale in some range of output levels even if it has decreasing returns in production in that output range.

==Formal definitions==

Formally, a production function &lt;math&gt;\ F(K,L)&lt;/math&gt; is defined to have:
*Constant returns to scale if (for any constant ''a''  greater than 0) &lt;math&gt;\ F(aK,aL)=aF(K,L) &lt;/math&gt;
*Increasing returns to scale if (for any constant ''a'' greater than 1) &lt;math&gt;\ F(aK,aL)&gt;aF(K,L), &lt;/math&gt;
*Decreasing returns to scale if (for any constant ''a'' greater than 1) &lt;math&gt;\ F(aK,aL)&lt;aF(K,L) &lt;/math&gt;
where ''K'' and ''L'' are factors of production—capital and labor, respectively.

In a more general set-up, for a multi-input-multi-output production processes, one may assume technology can be represented via some technology set, call it &lt;math&gt;\ T &lt;/math&gt;, which must satisfy some regularity conditions of production theory.&lt;ref&gt;• Shephard, R.W. (1953) Cost and production functions. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;• Shephard, R.W. (1970) Theory of cost and production functions. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;• Färe, R., and D. Primont (1995) Multi-Output Production and Duality: Theory and Applications. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;• [https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ejores/v228y2013i3p592-600.html Zelenyuk, V. (2013) “A scale elasticity measure for directional distance function and its dual: Theory and DEA estimation.” European Journal of Operational Research 228:3, pp 592–600]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;• [https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/jproda/v42y2014i1p15-24.html Zelenyuk V. (2014) “Scale efficiency and homotheticity: equivalence of primal and dual measures” Journal of Productivity Analysis 42:1,  pp 15-24.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, the property of constant returns to scale is equivalent to saying that technology set &lt;math&gt;\ T &lt;/math&gt; is a cone, i.e., satisfies the property &lt;math&gt;\ aT=T, \forall a&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;.  In turn, if there is a production function that will describe the technology set &lt;math&gt;\ T &lt;/math&gt; it will have to be homogeneous of degree 1.

==Formal example==

The [[Cobb–Douglas]] functional form has constant returns to scale when the sum of the exponents is 1.
The function is:
:&lt;math&gt;\ F(K,L)=AK^{b}L^{1-b}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; b &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus
:&lt;math&gt;\ F(aK,aL)=A(aK)^{b}(aL)^{1-b}=Aa^{b}a^{1-b}K^{b}L^{1-b}=aAK^{b}L^{1-b}=aF(K,L).&lt;/math&gt;

But if the Cobb–Douglas production function has its general form

:&lt;math&gt;\ F(K,L)=AK^{b}L^{c}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;c&lt;1,&lt;/math&gt; then there are increasing returns if ''b'' + ''c'' &gt; 1 but decreasing returns if ''b'' + ''c'' &lt; 1, since

:&lt;math&gt;\ F(aK,aL)=A(aK)^{b}(aL)^{c}=Aa^{b}a^{c}K^{b}L^{c}=a^{b+c}AK^{b}L^{c}=a^{b+c}F(K,L),&lt;/math&gt;

which is greater than or less than &lt;math&gt;aF(K,L)&lt;/math&gt; as ''b''+''c'' is greater or less than one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21445">'''Target costing''' is an approach to determine a product’s [[life-cycle cost]] which should be sufficient to develop specified functionality and quality, while ensuring its desired [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. It involves setting a target cost by subtracting a desired [[profit margin]] from a competitive market price.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A target cost is the maximum amount of cost that can be incurred on a product, however, the firm can still earn the required profit margin from that product at a particular selling price. Target costing decomposes the target cost from product level to component level. Through this decomposition, target costing spreads the competitive pressure faced by the company to product’s designers and suppliers. Target costing consists of cost planning in the design phase of production as well as cost control throughout the resulting [[Product lifecycle|product life cycle]]. The cardinal rule of target costing is to never exceed the target cost. However, the focus of target costing is not to minimize costs, but to achieve a desired level of [[cost reduction]] determined by the target costing process.

== Definition ==
Target costing is defined as "a disciplined process for determining and achieving a full-stream cost at which a proposed product with specified functionality, performance, and quality must be produced in order to generate the desired profitability at the product’s anticipated selling price over a specified period of time in the future." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clifton, Bird, Albano &amp; Townsend|title=Target Costing; Market-Driven Product Design|publisher=Marcel Dekker, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0-8247-4611-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition encompasses the principal concepts: products should be based on an accurate assessment of the wants and needs of customers in different market segments, and cost targets should be what result after a sustainable profit margin is subtracted from what customers are willing to pay at the time of product introduction and afterwards.

The fundamental objective of target costing is to manage the business to be profitable in a highly competitive marketplace. In effect, target costing is a proactive cost planning, [[cost management]], and [[cost reduction]] practice whereby costs are planned and managed out of a product and business early in the design and development cycle, rather than during the later stages of product development and production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maskell &amp; Baggaley|title=Practical Lean Accounting|publisher=Productivity Press, New York, NY|date=December 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Target costing was developed independently in both USA and Japan in different time periods.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burrows, G., Chanhall, R.H.|title=Target costing: first and second comings|url=|journal=Accounting History Review |volume=22 |issue=2 |date=July 2012 |pages=127–142|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Target costing was adopted earlier by American companies to reduce cost and improve productivity, such as [[Ford Motor]] from 1900s, American Motors from 1950s-1960s. Although the ideas of target costing were also applied by a number of other American companies including [[Boeing]], [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]], [[Northern Telecom]], few of them apply target costing as comprehensively and intensively as top Japanese companies such as [[Nissan]], [[Toyota]], [[Nippondenso]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|last=IMA – Institute of Management Accounts|date=1994|title=Implementing Target Costing|url=|publisher=The Society of Management Accounts of Canada|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Target costing emerged from Japan from 1960s to early 1970s with the particular effort of Japanese automobile industry, including Toyota and Nissan. It did not receive global attention until late 1980s to 1990s when some authors such as Monden (1992),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Monden, Yasuhiro  |author2=Kazuki Hamada |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1991|title=Target costing and kaizen costing in Japanese automobile companies|url=|journal=Journal of Management Accounting Research|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakurai (1989),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sakurai, Michiharu|date=1989|title=Target costing and how to use it|url=|journal=Journal of Cost Management|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanaka (1993),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tanaka, Takao|date=1993|title=Target costing at Toyota|url=|journal=Journal of Cost Management|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cooper (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cooper, Robin|date=1992|title=Implementing activity based cost management|url=|publisher=The Institute of Management Accountants|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; described the way that Japanese companies applied target costing to thrive in their business (IMA 1994). With superior implementation systems, Japanese manufacturers are more successful than the American companies in developing target costing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Traditional [[cost-plus pricing]] strategy has been impeding the productivity and profitability for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Gagne, M.L.  |author2=Discenza, R. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1995|title=Target costing|url=|journal=Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=16–22|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hibbets, A.R., Albright, T., and Funk, W.|date=2005|title=The competitive environment and strategy of target costing implementers: evidence from the field|url=|journal=Journal of Managerial Issues |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=65–81|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a new strategy, target costing is replacing traditional cost-plus pricing strategy by maximizing [[customer satisfaction]] by accepted level of quality and functionality while minimizing costs.

== Process of target costing ==
The process of target costing can be divided into three sections: the first section involves in market-driven target costing, which focuses on studying market conditions to identify a product’s allowable cost in order to meet the company’s long-term profit at expected selling price; the second section involves performing cost reduction strategies with the product designer’s effort and creativity to identify the product-level target cost; the third section is component-level target cost which decomposes the production cost to functional and component levels to transmit cost responsibility to suppliers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Target costing process redraw.png|thumb|center|upright=3.2|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Target costing process&lt;/div&gt;]]

=== Market-driven target costing ===
Market driven target costing is the first section in the target costing process which focuses on studying market conditions and determining the company’s [[profit margin]] in order to identify the allowable cost of a product. Market driven costing can go through 5 steps including: establish company’s long-term sales and profit objective; develop the mix of products; identify target selling price for each product; identify profit margin for each product; and calculate allowable cost of each product.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Company’s long-term sales and profit objectives are developed from an extensive analysis of relevant information relating to customers, market and products. Only realistic plans are accepted to proceed to the next step. [[Product lining|Product mix]] is designed carefully to ensure that it satisfies many customers, but also does not contain too many products to confuse customers. Company may use simulation to explore the impact of overall profit objective to different product mixes and determine the most feasible product mix. Target selling price, target profit margin and allowable cost are identified for each product. Target selling price need to consider to the expected market condition at the time launching the product. Internal factors such as product’s functionality and profit objective, and external factors such as company’s image or expected price of competitive products will influence target selling price. Company’s long-term profit plan and life-cycle cost are considered when determining target profit margin. Firms might set up target profit margin based on either actual profit margin of previous products or target profit margin of product line. Simulation for overall group profitability can help to make sure achieving group target. Subtracting target profit margin from target selling price results in allowable cost for each product. Allowable cost is the cost that can spend on the product to ensure meeting profit target if selling it at target price. It is the signal about the magnitude of cost saving that team need to achieve.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Product-level target costing ===
Following the completion of market-driven costing, the next task of the target costing process is product-level target costing. Product-level target costing concentrates on designing products that satisfy the company's customers at the allowable cost. To achieve this goal, product-level target costing is typically divided into three steps as shown below.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Product-level target costing redraw.png|thumb|center|upright=2|&lt;div align="center"&gt;Product-level target costing&lt;/div&gt;]]

The first step is to set a product-level target cost. Since the allowable cost is simply obtained from external conditions without considering the design capabilities of the company as well as the realistic cost for manufacturing, it may not be always achievable in practice. Thus, it is necessary to adjust the unachievable allowable cost to an achievable target cost that the cost increase should be reduced with great effort. The second step is to discipline this target cost process, including monitoring the relationship between the target cost and the estimated product cost at any point during the design process, applying the cardinal rule so that the total target costs at the component-level does not exceed the target cost of the product, and allowing exceptions for products violating the cardinal rule. For a product exception to the cardinal rule, two analyses are often performed after the launch of the product. One involves reviewing the design process to find out why the target cost was unachieved. The other is an immediate effort to reduce the excessive cost to ensure that the period of violation is as short as possible. Once the target cost-reduction objective is identified, the product-level target costing comes to the final step, finding ways to achieve it. Engineering methods such as [[value engineering]] (VE), [[DFMA|design for manufacture and assembly]] (DFMA), and [[quality function deployment]] (QFD) are commonly adopted in this step.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Target costing and value engineering ==

[[Value engineering]] (VE), also known as value analysis (VA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miles|first1=Lawrence|title=Techniques of Value Analysis Engineering|date=March 9, 2015|publisher=Lawrence D. Miles Value Foundation|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; plays a crucial role in the target costing process, particularly at the product level and the component level. Among the three aforementioned methods in achieving the target cost, VE is the most critical one because not only does it attempt to reduce costs, but also aims to improve the functionality and quality of products. There are a variety of practical VE strategies, including zero-look, first-look and second-look VE approaches, as well as [[Product teardown|teardown]] approaches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Target Costing and Value Engineering|last=Cooper &amp; Slagmulder|publisher=Productivity Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Portland, OR, USA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the complexity of problems in the real world, implementing the target costing process often relies on the [[computer simulation]] to reproduce stochastic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bode|first1=Jurgen|title=Neural networks for cost estimation: Simulations and pilot application|journal=International Journal of Production Research|date=2000|volume=38|issue=6|pages=1231–1254}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many firms use simulation to study the complex relationship between selling prices and profit margins, the impact of individual product decisions on overall group profitability, the right mix of products to enhance overall profit, or other economic modeling to overcome organizational inertia by getting the most productive reasoning. In addition, simulation helps estimate results rapidly for dynamic process changes.

== Factors affecting target costing ==
The factors influencing the target costing process is broadly categorized based on how a company's strategy for a product's quality, functionality and price change over time. However, some factors play a specific role based on what drives a company's approach to target costing.

=== Factors influencing market-driven costing ===
Intensity of competition and nature of the customer affect market-driven costing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khandwalla|first1=Pradip|title=The Effect of Different Types of Competition on the Use of Management Controls|journal=Journal of Accounting Research|date=Autumn 1972|volume=10|issue=2|pages=275–285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitors introducing similar products has been shown to drive rival companies to expend energy on implementing target costing systems such as in the case of Toyota and Nissan or [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Google]]. The costing process is also affected by the level of customer sophistication, changing requirements and the degree to which their future requirements are known. The [[automotive]] and [[camera]] industry are prime examples for how customers affect target costing based on their exact requirements.

=== Factors influencing product-level costing ===
[[Product strategy]] and product characteristics affect product-level target costing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Characteristics of product strategy such as number of products in line, rate of redesign operations and level of innovation are shown to have an effect. Higher number of products has a direct correlation with the benefits of target costing. Frequent redesigns lead to the introduction of new products that have created better benefits to target costing. It has to be noted that the value of historical information reduces with greater innovation, thereby, reducing the benefits of product level target costing.

The degree of complexity of the product, level of investments required and the duration of product development process make up the factors that affect the target costing process based on product characteristics. Product viability is determined by the aforementioned factors. In turn, the target costing process is also modified to suit the different degrees of complexity required.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Factors influencing component-level costing ===
Supplier-Base strategy is the main factor that determines component-level target costing because it is known to play a key role in the details a firm has about its supplier capabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are three characteristics that make up the supplier-base strategy, including the degree of [[horizontal integration]], power over suppliers and nature of supplier relations. Horizontal integration captures the fraction of product costs sourced externally. Cost pressures on suppliers can drive target costing if the [[buying power]] of firms is high enough. In turn, this may lead to better benefits. More cooperative supplier relations have been shown to increase mutual benefits in terms of target costs particularly at a component level.

== Applications ==
Aside from the application of target costing in the field of manufacturing, target costing are also widely used in the following areas.

=== Energy ===
An Energy Retrofit Loan Analysis Model has been developed using a [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo (MC) method]] for target costing in [[Efficient energy use|Energy Efficient]] buildings and construction. MC method has been shown to be effective in determining the impact of financial uncertainties in project performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~tommelein/papers/2012-Lee-PhD.pdf|title=Application of Target Value Design to Energy Efficiency Investments|last=Lee|first=Hyun Woo|date=Spring 2012|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Target Value Design Decision Making Process (TVD-DMP) groups a set of energy efficiency methods at different optimization levels to evaluate costs and uncertainties involved in the energy efficiency process. Some major design parameters are specified using this methods including Facility Operation Schedule, Orientation, [[Plug load]], [[HVAC]] and [[lighting]] systems.

The entire process consists of three phases: initiation, definition and alignment. Initiation stage involves developing a business case for energy efficiency using target value design (TVD) training, organization and compensation. The definition process involves defining and validating the case by tools such as values analysis and bench marking processes to determine the allowable costs. By setting targets and designing the design process to align with those targets, TVD-DMP has been shown to achieve a high level of collaboration needed for energy efficiency investments. This is done by using [[risk analysis]] tools, pull planning and rapid estimating processes.

=== Healthcare ===
Target costing and target value design have applications in building healthcare facilities including critical components such as [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit]]s (NICUs). The process is influenced by unit locations, degree of comfort, number of patients per room, type of supply location and access to nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rybkowski, Shepley|date=Summer 2012|title=Target Value Design: Applications to Newborn Intensive Care Units|url=|journal=Health Environments Research &amp; Design Journal|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[National Vital Statistics System|National Vital Statistics]] Reports, 12.18% of 2009 births were premature and the cost per infant was $51,600. This led to opportunities for NICUs to implement target value design for deciding whether to build a single-family room or more open-bay NICUs. This was achieved using set-based design analysis which challenges the designer to generate multiple alternatives for the same functionality. Designs are evaluated keeping in mind the requirements of the various stakeholders in the NICU including nurses, doctors, family members and administrators. Unlike linear point-based design, set-based design narrows options to the optimal one by eliminating alternatives simultaneously defined by user constraints.

=== Construction ===
About 15% construction project in Japan adopted target costing for their cost planning and management as recognized by Jacomit (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacomit, A.M, Granja. A.D., Picchi, F.A.|date=2008|title=Target costing research analysis: reflections for construction industry implementation|url=|journal=16th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction. Manchester, UK. 16–18 July|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., target costing research has been carried out within the framework of lean construction as target value design (TVD) method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ballard, G.|date=2000|title=Lean Project Delivery System|url=|journal=Lean Construction Institute White Paper N8. Revision 1|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been disseminated widely over construction industry in recent years. Research has proven that if being applied systematically, TVD can deliver a significant improvement in project performance with average reduction of 15% in comparison with market cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimina, D., Ballard, G., Pasquire, C.|date=2012|title=Target value design: using collaboration and a lean approach to reduce construction cost|url=|journal=Construction Management and Economics |volume=30 |pages=383–398|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
TVD in construction project considers the final cost of project as a design parameter, similar to the capacity and aesthetics requirements for the project. TVD requires the project team to develop a target cost from the beginning. The project team is expected not to design exceeding the target cost without the owner’s approval, and must use different skills to maintain this target cost. In some cases, the cost can increase but the project team must commit to decrease and must try their best to decrease without impacting on other functions of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morgan, J., Coci, L.|date=2012|title=Recommended Practices for the Application of Lean Construction Methods to Building New Australian LNG Capacity|url=|journal=Engineers Australia. Western Australia Division|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9439">'''Telephone counseling''' refers to any type of psychological service performed over the [[telephone]].  Telephone counseling ranges from individual, couple or group psychotherapy with a professional therapist to [[Emergency psychiatry|psychological first aid]] provided by para-professional counselors. In-person therapists often advise clients to make use of telephone crisis counseling to provide the client with an avenue to obtain support outside of therapy if they cannot be reached in an emergency or at the conclusion of a therapeutic relationship.

==Professional counseling by telephone==
Researchers have begun observing a growing trend in which licensed psychotherapists and psychologists are now seeing at least some of their clients via the telephone.&lt;ref name="Barnett"&gt;Barnett, J.; Scheetz, K. (2003). Technological advances and telehealth: Ethics, law, and the practice of psychotherapy. Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training. 40(1-2), 86-93&lt;/ref&gt;  A body of research exists comparing the efficacy of telephone counseling to in-person counseling and to no treatment. A recent study found that more than half of clients (58%) who had experienced both in-person and phone counseling preferred phone counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, R., Conoley, C., Brossart, D. (2006) The Attractiveness of Telephone Counseling: An Empirical Investigation of Client Perceptions. Journal of Counseling &amp; Development. 84:1, 54-60.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 study found that phone counseling clients rate their counseling relationship similarly to in-person clients.&lt;ref&gt;Reese, R; Conoley, C.; Brossart, D.(2002). Effectiveness of Telephone Counseling: A Field-Based Investigation. Journal of Counseling Psychology, 49:2, 233-242&lt;/ref&gt; Phone counseling has been established as an effective treatment for diagnoses ranging from [[major depressive disorder|depression]]&lt;ref&gt;Lynch DJ, Tamburrino MB, Nagel R. (1997). Telephone counseling for patients with minor depression: preliminary findings in a family practice setting. J Fam Pract. 44(3):293-8.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[agoraphobia]].&lt;ref&gt;Tutty S, Simon G, Ludman E. (2000). Telephone counseling as an adjunct to antidepressant treatment in the primary care system. A pilot study. Eff Clin Pract. 3(4):191-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crisis hotlines==
{{main article|Crisis hotline}}
"Crisis" hotlines also provide telephone support services, known as [[helpline]]s.  These may be state-funded or provided by churches or charities and often serve the primary function of [[suicide prevention]].  However, many lines also accept calls from people who are not in active suicidal crisis.  The term "emotional support helpline" is sometimes used to avoid the implication that a caller must be in crisis to use services.  Some emotional support services employ email &amp; messaging technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samaritans.org/talk_to_someone/email.aspx|title=Email services|author=Samaritans|accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quitlines==
{{main article|Quitline}}
Quitlines are helplines that offer advanced treatment for addiction and behavior change. Quitlines should not be confused with centralized [[call centers]] offering advice in a wide spectrum of fields for the purpose of receiving and transmitting a large volume of requests.

==Child helplines==
Child helplines are help and support services for children, run by civil society organizations and or government bodies. Child helplines specialize in offering information, support, advice or counseling to people 18 years of age or younger. [[Child helpline international|Child Helpline International]], an international network of child helplines, was formed in 2003 to support the development of child helplines and enable the information gathered by child helplines around the world on children's rights and welfare issues to be assembled for [[advocacy]] purposes.

== Advantages over in-person therapy ==
Unlike other forms of counseling, telephone counseling is potentially free of certain constraining factors that affect traditional therapy, including [[geography]], [[time]], duration, and cost, making this form of counseling more accessible for a number of people who would be unable to attend traditional psychotherapy. It also provides a degree of [[anonymity]] that is comforting to some callers, reducing the intimidation that some people may feel at the prospect of seeking treatment with a traditional in-person therapist and encouraging disclosure. Also research shows telephone counseling to have better results among patients with depression.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory E. Simon et al, "[http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?volume=292&amp;issue=8&amp;page=935 Telephone Psychotherapy and Telephone Care Management for Primary Care Patients Starting Antidepressant Treatment]", ''Journal of American Medical Association'', August 25, 2004, Vol 292, No. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages over in-person therapy==
Being physically present with your counselor may help you feel more connected with him or her; the telephone may contribute to "distance" in the therapeutic relationship.  Some people feel safer letting themselves become emotional in the physical presence of another person.

Because the client often calls from a location that is part of their day-to-day life, calls often center around, or are interrupted by, situational pressures that the person is currently immersed in. This can have both positive and negative effects on the counseling provided; by allowing the counselor some insight into the person's situation, the counselor can be more objective. Conversely, the disruptions and pressures of situational factors may make it difficult for the client to adopt a reflective state or maintain full focus on the counseling session.

In the case of para-professional counseling (meaning a non-licensed therapist), there may not be guaranteed privacy; the electronic technologies involved make it difficult to prevent multiple phone connections, loudspeakers, or recording of the interactions. This fact may present a problem to a paranoid personality who suspects that others are monitoring his or her calls.

If the counseling is provided by an organization staffed by a number of employees or volunteers, a repeat caller cannot develop a relationship with a counselor in the same way as in traditional therapy, which may impede progress. These organizations typically limit calls in time and frequency, preventing deeper analysis and thus the use of therapeutic modalities that depend on it (i.e. psychoanalysis).

Phone counseling is not appropriate for people who are homicidal, suicidal, self injuring, or requiring more care than one session per week. Phone counselors may not be acquainted with local emergency service options.&lt;ref name="Barnett" /&gt;  Counselors at locally operated suicide hotlines are trained in emergency services and acquainted with local resources.

==Examples of nonprofit telephone counseling services==
* The Jeevan Aastha Helpline is an initiative by the Gandhinagar Police Department, Gujarat to provide assistance to those seeking immediate mental health counselling across India. The helpline has a toll free number 1800 233 3330 which can be called on 24/7. The team comprises eight counsellors and one senior counsellor, all of whom have at least a master's degree in Psychology.

'''''The Wolf of Wall Street''''' is a 2013 American [[biographical film| biographical]] [[black comedy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10579726/The-Wolf-of-Wall-Street-is-the-modern-equivalent-of-a-Shakespeare-play.html|title=The Wolf of Wall Street is the modern equivalent of a Shakespearean history play|first=Philip|last=Horne|date=October 4, 2017|accessdate=October 4, 2017|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[crime film|crime]] film directed by [[Martin Scorsese]] and written by [[Terence Winter]], based on the [[The Wolf of Wall Street (book)|memoir of the same name]] by [[Jordan Belfort]]. It recounts Belfort's perspective on his career as a stockbroker in [[New York City]] and how his firm [[Stratton Oakmont]] engaged in rampant corruption and fraud on [[Wall Street]] that ultimately led to his downfall. [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] (who was also a producer) stars as Belfort, with [[Jonah Hill]] as his business partner and friend Donnie Azoff, [[Margot Robbie]] as his wife Naomi Lapaglia and [[Kyle Chandler]] as Patrick Denham, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent who tries to bring him down. [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Rob Reiner]], [[Jon Favreau]], [[Joanna Lumley]] and [[Jean Dujardin]] also star. The film marks the [[Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio|director's fifth collaboration with DiCaprio]], after ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (2002), ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2004), ''[[The Departed]]'' (2006) and ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' (2010), as well as his second collaboration with Winter after the television series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' (2010–14).

''The Wolf of Wall Street'' premiered in New York City on December 17, 2013, and was released in the United States on December 25, 2013, distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film was the first to be released entirely through [[digital distribution]]. It was a major commercial success, grossing more than $392 million worldwide during its original theatrical run to become Scorsese's highest-grossing film and the 17th-highest-grossing film of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=2013&amp;p=.htm|title=2013 Yearly Box Office Results|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was controversial for its morally ambiguous depiction of events, explicit sexual content, extreme profanity, depiction of hard drug use and the [[Animals in film and television|use of animals]] during production. The film also caused controversy due to accusations that it was financed by illegally obtained funds from [[1Malaysia Development Berhad]] (1MDB).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/336199 | title = WSJ: US$155m of 1MDB funds went to ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ |website=Malaysiakini.com|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/09/red-granite-settlement-1mdb-corruption-scandal-1202170872/|title=Red Granite Settles With U.S. Government Over 2 Films As Part Of 1MDB Case|last=Busch|first=Patrick Hipes, Anita|date=2017-09-15|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, with praise for Scorsese's direction, the comedic performance of DiCaprio and the fast-paced and consistent humor.

==Plot==
In 1987, [[Jordan Belfort]] procures a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for [[L.F. Rothschild]], employed under Mark Hanna, who quickly entices him with the sex and drugs fueled stockbroker culture and passes on his idea that a stockbroker's only goal is to make money for himself. Jordan soon finds his career terminated following [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]] and takes a job at a [[Boiler room (business)|boiler room brokerage firm]] on Long Island that specializes in [[penny stock]]s. Thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune.

Jordan befriends his neighbor, Donnie Azoff, and the two found their own company. They recruit several of Jordan's friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the "hard sell". The basic method of the firm is a [[pump and dump]] scam. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name of [[Stratton Oakmont]]. After an exposé in ''[[Forbes]]'', hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company. Jordan becomes immensely successful and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia. When his wife finds out, Jordan divorces her and marries Naomi. Meanwhile, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] begin investigating Stratton Oakmont. Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours upon securing the [[Initial public offering|IPO]] of [[Steve Madden (company)|Steve Madden]]. This brings him and his firm further to the attention of the FBI. To hide his money, Jordan opens a [[Swiss bank account]] with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi's Aunt Emma, who is a British national and thus outside the reach of American authorities. He uses the wife and in-laws of his friend Brad Bodnick, who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland.

Donnie gets into a public brawl with Brad, and, while Donnie escapes, Brad is arrested. Brad does not say a word about Donnie or Jordan to the police. Jordan learns from his private investigator that the FBI is wiretapping his phones. Fearing for his son, Jordan's father advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordan's lawyer negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison. Jordan, however, cannot bear to quit and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech. Jordan, Donnie, and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy when they learn that Aunt Emma has died of a heart attack. Jordan decides to travel to Switzerland immediately to settle the bank account. To bypass border controls, he orders his yacht captain to sail to Monaco, but the ship is capsized in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine. Jordan takes this as a sign from God and decides to sober up.

Two years later, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel, arrested in Florida on an unrelated charge, has informed the FBI on Jordan. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency. Now fed up with Jordan's lifestyle, Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their children. Infuriated, Jordan hits Naomi twice, insults her as a "[[cunt]]" and tries to run off with his daughter Skylar in his car, but he ends up crashing in the driveway. The next morning, Jordan wears a wire to work but slips a note to Donnie warning him. Donnie keeps the note and rats out Jordan to the FBI. Jordan is arrested for breaching his co-operation deal. The FBI raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont. Despite his breach, Jordan receives a reduced sentence for his testimony and serves three years in a minimum security prison. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales technique.

===Development===
In 2007, [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]/[[Warner Bros.]] won a bidding war against [[Brad Pitt]]/[[Paramount Pictures]] for the rights to Jordan Belfort's memoir ''The Wolf of Wall Street'', and Martin Scorsese was considered to direct the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Pamela McClintock |url=https://variety.com/2007/film/news/scorsese-dicaprio-cry-wolf-1117961782/ |title=Scorsese, DiCaprio cry ‘Wolf’ |newspaper=Variety |date=2007-03-25 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hollywood Reporter" /&gt; During pre-production, Scorsese worked on the film's script before working on ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]''. He describes having "wasted five months of [his] life" without getting a [[Green-light|green light]] on production dates by the Warner Bros. studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jerry |last=Saravia |title=Raging Bull of Cinema Part II|url=http://jerrysaravia.blogspot.com/2011/08/raging-of-bull-of-cinema-part-2.html |date=June 5, 2013 |accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan Belfort made $1 million on the movie rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Charlie Gasparino |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/2013/03/12/wolf-wall-street-gets-1m-pay-day-for-movie-rights/ |title='Wolf of Wall Street' Gets $1M Pay Day for Movie Rights |publisher=Fox Business |date=2013-03-12 |accessdate=2014-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217034106/http://www.foxbusiness.com/2013/03/12/wolf-wall-street-gets-1m-pay-day-for-movie-rights/ |archivedate=February 17, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Warner Bros. had offered [[Ridley Scott]] to direct the film, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing the male lead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/07/ridley-scott-eyeing-reteam-with-leo-dicaprio-on-the-wolf-of-wall-street/ |title=Ridley Scott Eyeing Reteam With Leo DiCaprio On 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' |publisher=Deadline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the studio eventually dumped the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/05/cannes-red-granite-acquires-leonardo-dicaprio-pic-the-wolf-of-wall-street/ |title=Cannes: Red Granite Acquires Leonardo DiCaprio Pic 'The Wolf Of Wall Street' |publisher=Deadline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a green light was given by the [[Independent film|independent company]] [[Red Granite Pictures]] allowing no restrictions to the content development. Scorsese knew that there were no limits to the content that he would produce and therefore came back on board, resulting in an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R rating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|date=2013-08-25|title=Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese Explore the Funny Side of Financial Depravity in The Wolf of Wall Street|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/dicaprio-scorsese-wolf-of-wall-street.html|first=Mary Kaye|last=Schilling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red Granite Pictures also asked [[Paramount Pictures]] to distribute the film;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/01/oscars-qa-wolf-of-wall-street-producer-emma-tillinger-koskoff-on-sexy-scary-infuriating-pic/ |title=OSCARS Q&amp;A: 'Wolf Of Wall Street' Producer Emma Tillinger Koskoff On 'Sexy, Scary, Infuriating' Pic |publisher=Deadline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paramount Pictures]] agreed to distribute the film in North America and Japan, but passed on the rest of the international market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/business/media/strong-profit-margin-at-paramount-pictures-underlines-a-hollywood-shift.html?pagewanted=all|title=Strong Profit Margin at Paramount Pictures Underlines a Hollywood Shift|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2012-02-12|first1=Michael|last1=Cieply|first2=Brooks|last2=Barnes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI has issued subpoenas to several past and present employees of Red Granite Pictures in regards to allegations that US$155&amp;nbsp;million was diverted from the Malaysian wealth fund [[1MDB]] to help finance ''The Wolf of Wall Street''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/malaysias-1mdb-the-secret-money-behind-the-wolf-of-wall-street-1459531987|title=The Secret Money Behind 'The Wolf of Wall Street'|first1=Bradley|last1=Hope|first2=John R.

In the film, most of the real-life characters' names have been changed from Belfort's original memoir. Donnie Azoff is based on [[Danny Porush]]. The name was changed after Porush threatened to sue the filmmakers. Porush maintains that much of the film was fictional and that Donnie Azoff was not in fact an accurate depiction of him.&lt;ref name=NYDailyNews&gt;{{cite news |title=Real 'Wolf of Wall Street' exec's son slams movie's 'inaccurate' characterization of his father|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/real-wolf-wall-street-exec-son-slams-movie-inaccurate-characterization-father-article-1.1552963|date= December 19, 2013|accessdate= 1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Dockterman, Eliana|title=The Wolf of Wall Street: The True Story|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/12/26/wolf-wall-street-true-story/|date= December 26, 2013|accessdate= 1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=I saw him morph from nice guy into showy narcissist': Ex wife of former Wolf of Wall St. reveals what it was like to be married to Danny Porush|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2521346/Ex-wife-Wolf-Wall-St-reveals-like-married-Danny-Porush.html|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date= 10 December 2013|accessdate= 1 March 2014|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI agent known as Patrick Denham is the stand-in for real-life Gregory Coleman,&lt;ref name="Chandler"&gt;{{cite web | last = Napier | first = Jim |title=Kyle Chandler Joins Martin Scorsese's THE WOLF OF WALL STREET |url=http://geektyrant.com/news/2012/5/10/kyle-chandler-joins-martin-scorseses-the-wolf-of-wall-street.html |work=Geektyrant.com |publisher=Geektyrant Industries LLC |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lawyer Manny Riskin is based on [[Ira Sorkin]].&lt;ref name="Sorkin"&gt;{{cite web |author=Paur, Joey |title=Jon Favreau Joins Martin Scorsese's THE WOLF OF WALL STREET |url=http://geektyrant.com/news/2012/7/25/jon-favreau-joins-martin-scorseses-the-wolf-of-wall-street.html |work=Geektyrant.com |publisher=Geektyrant Industries LLC |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belfort's first wife Denise Lombardo is renamed Teresa Petrillo, while second wife Nadine Caridi became Naomi Lapaglia on-screen.

In January 2014, [[Jonah Hill]] revealed in an interview with [[Howard Stern]] that he made only $60,000 on the film (the lowest possible [[SAG-AFTRA]] rate for his amount of work), while his co-star Leonardo DiCaprio (who also produced) received $10 million.

I think Marty just feels it's unfortunately over, and there's been no bigger champion of film than him."&lt;ref name="Empire" /&gt; After extensive comparison tests during pre-production, eventually the majority of the film was shot on film stock while scenes that used [[Chroma key|green screen]] effects or low light were shot with the digital [[Arri Alexa]].&lt;ref name="American Cinematographer Magazine"/&gt; The film contains 400–450 [[VFX]] shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennett|first=Neil|title=Interview: The Wolf of Wall Street's VFX producer|url=http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/motion-graphics/interview-wolf-of-wall-streets-vfx-producer/|publisher=Digitalartsonline.co.uk|accessdate=December 17, 2013|date=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of animals===
''The Wolf of Wall Street'' uses animals including a chimpanzee, a lion, a snake, a fish, and dogs.&lt;ref name="tadeo"&gt;{{cite news | last=Tadeo | first=Maria | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/chimpanzee-dressed-in-a-suit-rollerskating-through-prostitutes-and-dwarves-in-wolf-of-wall-street-prompts-boycott-calls-9008405.html | title=Chimpanzee dressed in a suit roller-skating through prostitutes and dwarves in Wolf of Wall Street prompts boycott calls | work=[[The Independent]] | date=December 16, 2013 | accessdate=January 16, 2014 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chimpanzee and the lion were provided by the Big Cat Habitat wildlife sanctuary in [[Sarasota County, Florida]].

In December 2013, before the film's premiere, the organization [[Friends of Animals]] criticized the use of the chimpanzee and organized a boycott of the film. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported, "Friends of Animals thinks the chimp ... suffered irreversible psychological damage after being forced to act."&lt;ref name="variety-boycott"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Khatchatourian | first=Maane | url= https://variety.com/2013/film/news/wolf-of-wall-street-boycot-1200953311/ | title= Animal Rights Group Boycotting 'Wolf of Wall Street' | journal= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date= December 13, 2013 | accessdate=January 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' said, "Criticism of ''The Wolf of Wall Street'''s use of a chimpanzee arrives as Hollywood comes under ever-increasing scrutiny for its employment of animals on screen," referring to a November 2013 report in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' that was critical of the [[American Humane Association]]'s treatment of animals in films.&lt;ref name="child" /&gt; [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] also launched a campaign to highlight mistreatment of ape "actors" and to petition for DiCaprio not to work with great apes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Kenneally | first=Tim | url=http://www.thewrap.com/leonardo-dicaprio-wolf-of-wall-street-peta-animal-rights | title=Leonardo DiCaprio Slammed by PETA Over ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ Monkey Business | work=The Wrap | publisher=The Wrap News, Inc. | date=December 16, 2013 | accessdate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christina McDowell, daughter of Tom Prousalis, who worked closely with the real-life Belfort at Stratton Oakmont, wrote an [[open letter]] addressing Scorsese, DiCaprio, and Belfort himself, criticizing the film for insufficiently portraying the victims of the financial crimes created by Stratton Oakmont, for disregarding the damage that was done to her family as a result, and for giving celebrity to persons (Belfort and his partners, including her father) who do not deserve it.&lt;ref name="laweekly"&gt;{{cite web | date = December 26, 2013 | author = Christina McDowell | url = http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2013/12/wolf_of_wall_street_prousalis.php?page=2 | title = An Open Letter to the Makers of The Wolf of Wall Street, and the Wolf Himself | work = [[LA Weekly]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Perlberg of ''[[Business Insider]]'' saw an [[screener (promotional)|advance screening]] of the film at a [[Regal Entertainment Group|Regal Cinemas]] near the [[Goldman Sachs]] building, with an audience of financial workers.

The former [[Assistant United States Attorney]] who prosecuted the real Belfort criticized both the movie and the book on which it is based. He said he believes some of Belfort's claims were "invented", as for instance "[Belfort] aggrandized his importance and reverence for him by others at his firm." He strongly criticizes the film for not depicting the "thousands of [scam] victims who lost hundreds of millions of dollars", not accepting the filmmakers' argument that it would have detracted attention from the wrongdoers. Furthermore, he deplores the ending—"beyond an insult" to his victims—in which the real Belfort appears, while showing "a large sign advertising the name of Mr. Belfort's real motivational speaking company", and a positive depiction of Belfort uttering "variants of the same falsehoods he trained others to use against his victims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Joel M.|title=The Real Belfort Story Missing From 'Wolf' Movie|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/the-real-belfort-story-missing-from-wolf-movie/?_r=0|accessdate=9 November 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7100">'''Theophilus Cazenove''', or '''Theophile Cazenove''' (13 October 1740 – 6 March 1811), was a Dutch financier and one of the agents of the [[Holland Land Company]].

== Life and career ==

Theophilus Cazenove was born in [[Amsterdam]] on 13 October 1740, as the son of Théophile Cazenove and Marie de Rapin-Thoyras, French/Swiss [[Huguenots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huguenot-manakin.org/manakin/brock1.php|title=Huguenot Society FMCV - Documents relating to the Hugenot Emigration|work=huguenot-manakin.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a merchant and banker in Bordeaux, Saint Petersburg, [[Archangelsk]], Stockholm and the West-Indies; in 1759 he lost four ships loaded with sugar and coffee, which were taken by a Bristol [[privateer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7QPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA925 |title=Miscellaneous Correspondence, Containing a Variety of Subjects, Relative to Natural and Civil History, Geography, Mathematics, Poetry, Memoirs of Monthly Occurrences, Catalogues of New Books, &amp;c. |first=Benjamin |last=Martin |date=1759 |page=925}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1760 the elder Théophile gave up his business and his sons Charles and Theophile assumed control of the company. In 1763, Theophile married Margaretha Helena van Jever, the daughter of a tradesman in Russia, and a member of the [[vroedschap]]. Cazenove spent his early career in commercial transactions in France and Russia, but went broke in 1770. In the same year, his portrait was painted by [[Jean-Baptiste Perronneau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collections.bm-lyon.fr/BML_01ICO001014cd411e7e7d29?&amp;query&amp;#91;&amp;#93;=subject:%22Mus%C3%A9e%20lyonnais%20des%20arts%20d%C3%A9coratifs%20%28Lyon%29%22&amp;hitStart=13&amp;hitTotal=14&amp;hitPageSize=16|title=Photographes en Rhône-Alpes::Chambre de Commerce de Lyon ; Musée des Arts décoratifs : J. -B.

In 1788 he collaborated with [[Étienne Clavière]] and [[Jacques Pierre Brissot]], who both traveled to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warville|first1=Jacques-Pierre Brissot de|last2=Clavière|first2=Étienne|title=New Travels in the United States of America: Including The Commerce of America with Europe; Particularly with France and Great Britain. In Two Volumes|date=1994|publisher=J.S. Jordan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbUVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA149 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1789 Cazenove was retained by [[Wilheim Willink|Pieter Stadnitski]] to travel to the United States to act as an investment agent for Stadnitski and other Dutch investors ([[Nicolaas van Staphorst|Nicolaas and Jacob Van Staphorst]], Pieter &amp; Christiaen [[Van Eeghen]], and Ten Cate &amp; Vollenhoven).&lt;ref&gt;http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/archieven/archiefbank/overzicht/333.nl.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onserfdeel.be/nl/uit_archief_detail.asp?artikel_id=14060&lt;/ref&gt; Casenove settled in at [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|Market Street]] in [[Philadelphia]], where he dealt with financier [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]]; his fellow traveller [[Gerrit Boon]] later went north. Boon believed that harvesting [[maple syrup]] could be a year-round activity, so slavery on the [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s could be avoided.

In 1792 Cazenove invested his clients' money in development bonds issued by the new states and the federal government, after [[Alexander Hamilton]] promised to fully pay the debt. Another venture included investing in large tracts of undeveloped land in [[Genesee County, New York]], which included the [[Holland Purchase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great American Land Bubble |date=1966 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |isbn=9781610162982 |page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYBKl5rM2O8C&amp;pg=PA61}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to implement these large and difficult purchases (sometimes complicated by the claims of Native Americans), he employed the advisory services of Hamilton and later [[Aaron Burr]].

Cazenove lived well as a "grand seigneur" and was known for his extreme carelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyccazen/Biographies/CazenoveT.html|title=Theophilus Cazenove Biography|work=ancestry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His business dealings in maple syrup and canals were not particularly successful and the investors barely made any profit, even losing money in the Pennsylvania land dealings which he organized with [[James Wilson]].  He was also hard pressed to account for funds that were under his control. During this period he helped [[Antoine Charles Cazenove|his cousin]] from Geneva to settle in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/record.php?id=122503768&amp;contributor=246&amp;archivename=Winterthur+Museum%2C+Garden%2C+and+Library|title=ArchiveGrid : Papers, 1791-1852,.|work=worldcat.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402173505/http://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/record.php?id=122503768&amp;contributor=246&amp;archivename=Winterthur+Museum%2C+Garden%2C+and+Library|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Baring (writer)|Alexander Baring]] wrote: "Cazenove is a sad dirty fellow and does all the mischief he can."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_bij005196001_01/_bij005196001_01_0003.php|title=Bijdragen en Mededelingen van het Historisch Genootschap|volume= 75 |work=dbnl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1798 he hired [[Joseph Ellicott]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffaloah.com/h/1799|title=Buffalo 1600-1799|work=buffaloah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Paolo Busti]] became his successor.

Although he became an American citizen in 1794, Cazenove returned to Europe in 1799. In Amsterdam he began to archive purchase of land for the financiers. He left the employment of the Dutch investors in 1802 and sought a position under [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord]], who he had met in Philadelphia in 1795, when also Talleyrand invested in land purchase.&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cazenovejournal101caze/cazenovejournal101caze_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Cazenove journal, 1794 : a record of the journey of Theophile Cazenove through New Jersey and Pennsylvania"|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cazenove died in Paris in the [[Rue du Bac]].&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

His correspondence along with the records of the Holland Land Company are held in the [[Amsterdam City Archives]].

A number of places in New York are named after him, including the [[Cazenovia (village), New York|Village of Cazenovia]], [[Cazenovia (town), New York|Town of Cazenovia]], [[Cazenovia College]], [[Cazenovia Lake]], and [[Cazenovia Creek]].

'''Thierry Breton''' (born 15 January 1955 in [[Paris]]) is a French businessman, a former [[Professor]] at [[Harvard Business School]], and a former [[Finance minister]] of [[France]].  He has been Vice Chairman and CEO of [[Groupe Bull]], Chairman and CEO of [[Technicolor SA|Thomson-RCA]] (1997–2002), Chairman and CEO of [[France Télécom]] (2002–2005).

Today an Honorary Chairman of both Thomson and France Telecom, he is, since 2008, Chairman and CEO of international information technology services company [[Atos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/companies/atos/ |title= Atos on Forbes Global 2000 list |date= May 2015 |website= Forbes |access-date= 21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was from 2005 to 2007 the French [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry]] in the governments of Prime Ministers [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] and [[Dominique de Villepin]], [[Jacques Chirac]] being the President de la Republique.

==Early life &amp; education==
Born in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris]], Thierry Breton completed his middle and high school education at the ''Ecole alsacienne'' in Paris and [[University-preparatory school]] classes for the [[Grandes écoles]] at [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]]. He received a master's degree in [[Electrical Engineering]] and [[Computer Science]] from [[École Supérieure d'Électricité]] (Supélec, now [[CentraleSupélec]]) in 1979 and later graduated from the ''Institut des hautes études de défense nationale'' ([[IHEDN]]).&lt;ref name="Who's Who"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whoswho.fr/bio/thierry-breton_23519 |title=Biography of Thierry Breton |language= French |date=26 March 2015 |website=https://www.whoswho.fr/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manager==
Thierry Breton began his career in 1979 as a professor of IT and Mathematics at the [[Lycée Français de New York]] as part of his military service through cooperation.&lt;ref name="Reference for Business"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/biography/A-E/Breton-Thierry-1955.html |title= Biography of Thierry Breton |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= Reference For Business |publisher= |access-date= 21 June 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 he created ''Forma Systems'', a systems-analysis and software-engineering company of which he became CEO until 1986.&lt;ref name = "Reference for Business"/&gt; He became that year adviser to the French Ministry of Education and Research [[René Monory]] and designed open-air science and technology theme park [[Futuroscope]]. From 1990 to 1993, he was managing director of [[CGI Group]], a global information technology company.&lt;ref name = "Reference for Business"/&gt;

===Groupe Bull===
In 1993, the French government hired Thierry Breton to help turn around troubled national computer maker [[Groupe Bull]]. As second in command, he managed to restructure the stock-market listed company and became in 1996 Vice-President of the Board of Directors. He is widely credited with pulling Bull from the edge of bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Breton new CEO of France Telecom |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/BUSINESS/10/02/ftel/index.html |journal=CNN.com |location=Atlanta |publisher=CNN News Group |date=2 October 2002 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

18 years later - in August 2014 - he became President of the Board of Directors following the company's acquisition by Atos.

===Thomson===
In 1997, the French government named Thierry Breton chairman and CEO of Thomson Multimedia, a state-owned consumer-electronics company that was on the verge of collapse. A year before France's prime minister [[Alain Juppé]] unsuccessfully tried to sell the company to South Korea–based Daewoo for a single franc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Is It Too Late For Thomson? |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/1997-08-24/is-it-too-late-for-thomson-intl-edition |journal=Businessweek Archives |location= |publisher= |date=24 August 1997 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thierry Breton made stock offerings in order to generate cash and diversified the company's businesses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Acquisition of Technicolor Will Boost Thomson Profit |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/30/local/me-18802 |journal=Los Angeles Times|location= |publisher= |date= 30 January 2001 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; figuring that consumer-electronics products were not high-end enough to consistently earn profits over the long term. Breton involved Thomson in interactive television, electronic publishing, and the Internet, as well as the higher-margin business of digital film-editing services. Thomson began manufacturing televisions with built-in software to run the electronic reference.

Thomson's new ventures instilled investors with renewed confidence in the company and allowed Thierry Breton to attract bigname companies such as [[Microsoft]], [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]], [[NEC]], and the [[DirecTV]] division of Hughes Electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Thomson Multimedia Finds Friends With Deep Pockets |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/01/business/international-business-thomson-multimedia-finds-friends-with-deep-pockets.html |journal=New York Times|location= |publisher= |date= 1 August 1998 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1999 Thomson was turning a $230 million profit on sales of $6.5 billion. By the time Breton left in 2002, revenues had increased by more than 80 percent and Thomson was outperforming [[Sony]], [[Matsushita]], and [[Philips]], its major consumer-electronics competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Thomson CEO Is Rare For a French Tech Chief |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1026678691908408840 |journal=The Wall Street Journal|location= |publisher= |date= 15 July 2002 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was elected ''Strategist of the Year'' by French financial newspaper [[La Tribune]]&lt;ref name = "Who's Who"/&gt; and was named Honorary President of the company in September 2002 following his departure for France Télécom.&lt;ref name = "Who's Who"/&gt;

===France Télécom===
Widely acclaimed as a ''Turnaround whiz''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Turnaround Whiz Breton Shakes Up France Telecom |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1040073507228936753 |journal=Wall Street Journal |location= |publisher= |date=18 December 2002 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Best European Performers |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2003-07-27/the-best-european-performers |journal=Bloomberg Business Magazine |location= |publisher= |date=27 July 2003 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thierry Breton was named by French government as head of multinational telecommunications corporation [[France Télécom]] on 2 October 2002.

In the past year, the company's share price had fallen about 70% while debts have ballooned to 60 billion euros ($54bn). A risky acquisition strategy that included mobile phone operator [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]], data carrier [[Equant]] and Internet service provider (ISP) [[Freeserve]] as well as several new, third-generation mobile phone licences had left France Telecom with the infamous title of the ''world's most indebted listed company''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=France Telecom: Battling debt |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1268527.stm |journal=Wall BBC News |location= |publisher= |date=19 April 2001 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time Thierry Breton took over share prices were worth less than 7 euros. Two months after his arrival these share prices had risen by 170%. He launched ''Ambition FT 2005'' and generated a three-tiered plan that called for cutting costs to increase cash flow, refinancing debt, and generating $16 billion from shareholders through a capital increase, all in efforts to save $30 billion over three years&lt;ref name="Reference for Business"/&gt;

The operator was simultaneously facing an intensification of the competition in its long time market of France, as well as a demand from the [[ARCEP]] to unbundle [[ADSL]]. As a response to these challenges Thierry Breton notably ended [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]]’s venture on the stock market and took back complete control over the subsidiary and its earnings.

In July 2003 he launched the plan ''Broadband internet for all'' with the objective of providing broadband to 90% of the French population. To do this he increased spending in the innovation sector by 20% and launched the charter ''Innovative Departments'' to speed up the development of broadband in rural areas. The following year the company recorded more than 7000 patents filed in France and abroad. In the same year France Télécom reintegrated with [[Wanadoo]] in order to integrate fixed telephony and [[service provider]] activities. In July 2004 Breton announced the launch of [[Livebox]], the operator's first [[Triple play (telecommunications)|Triple Play]] offer and France Télécom would become the first organisation to implement the concept of ''integrated operator''.

In September 2004 the French government finalised the privatisation of France Télécom on which it had been working progressively since 1996.  However, in accordance with the law of 31 December 2003 proposed and supported by Thierry Breton, the specific status of the employees was maintained. 
 
When he left the company for the Ministry of the Economy in February 2005 the share price was 23 euros. In less than three years the company’s debt was reduced to less than 40 billion euros. He was named as Honorary President of France Télécom.&lt;ref name="Who's Who"/&gt;

In January 2010 the ''Harvard Business Review'' first published a list of ''The 100 Best-Performing CEOs in the World'' which was based on an academic study comparing the performances of the heads of industry of the 2,000 biggest global companies, in their relevant fields, from 1995 to 2009. Thierry Breton held the 62nd position for his term as CEO of France Télécom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lib.uwo.ca/news/business/2010/01/09/bestperformingceosintheworld.html |title=Best Performing CEOs in the World |access-date=21 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621213606/https://www.lib.uwo.ca/news/business/2010/01/09/bestperformingceosintheworld.html |archivedate=21 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atos===
After two years of government service (2005-2007) he became in November 2008 the active chairman and CEO of [[Atos|Atos S.A.]], formerly Atos Origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chassany|first=Anne-Sylvaine|title=Atos Origin Board Fires Chief Germond, Hires Breton|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aOpHCL50TOTA|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=29 February 2012|date=17 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the announcement of his nomination the share price, which was previously valued at 18 euros, rose by 7.84%.

In 2008 Atos generated a sales revenue of 5.5 billion euros with a headcount of 50,000 employees but according to Thierry Breton was "managed too compartmentally" and the company’s inferior profitability margins compared to those of its competitors required a complete transformation plan.

In July 2011 he orchestrated the acquisition of the IT activities of German industry group [[Siemens]] which allowed the company to rank number one among the European IT services players and in the Top 5 worldwide, with 75 000 employees in 42 countries. The deal, valued at €850m ($1.1bn), was the biggest Franco-German transaction since an alliance between Germany’s premium carmaker [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] and France’s [[Renault]] early this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Siemens strikes tie-up deal with Atos |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/6ad4362c-07ca-11e0-a568-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3dh1zpbLy |journal=FT |location= |publisher= |date=14 December 2010 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation was lauded by the financial markets and the Atos share price rose by 11.6%.

With the integration of 28,000 engineers Atos became one of the most important Franco-German industrial collaborations since [[Airbus]], illustrated particularly by a financial partnership (Siemens took 15% of Atos’ capital), and a common investment fund of 100 million euros was created as well as a joint response to international tenders. This strategy was awarded the prize for ''Industrial cooperation'' by the Franco-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

In 2012 Thierry Breton adopted the [[Societas Europaea]] for Atos which gave the company two headquarters, one in France and a second in Munich, Germany.  Furthermore, he participated in other European institutional projects in which the Franco-German partnership played a central role such as the [[European Commission]]’s European Cloud Partnership (2012-2014) over which he co-presided with Jim Snabe, the co-CEO of the German world leader in software [[SAP SE|SAP]].

In May 2014 Thierry Breton launched a friendly takeover on French historic IT industry player Bull, turning Atos into the number one European company and one of the major global players in [[Big Data]] and [[Cybersecurity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Atos Takes Control of French Rival Bull |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/atos-takes-control-of-french-rival-bull-1408516048 |journal=Wall Street Journal|location= |publisher= |date=20 August 2014 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This acquisition, again commended by the markets (Atos’ share price rose by 6.2% and Bull’s by 21.9% the day of the announcement) notably allowed the company to position itself in the [[Supercomputing]] segment and to become the sole only European manufacturer.

Six months later he announced Atos’ acquisition of [[Xerox]]’s IT outsourcing activities as well as a strategic partnership with the American company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=French Computer-Services Company Atos to Buy Xerox’s IT Outsourcing Unit |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/french-computer-services-company-atos-to-buy-xeroxs-it-outsourcing-unit-1418949455 |journal=Wall Street Journal |location= |publisher= |date=19 December 2014 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This operation, which was viewed favorably by the Stock Market, made Atos one of the five largest digital companies in the world. The company had doubled in size within six years with a headcount of around 100,000 employees.

Thierry Breton got World attention after an interview with the [[Wall Street Journal]] in 2011 when he reiterated his intention to ban internal Email, dubbed as "the pollution of the information age", at Atos within 18 months (known as the [[Zero-Email Strategy]]), replacing internal emails by a set of Enterprise Social Networks, Enterprise Instant Messaging, Collaborative tools etc..., both being developed inhouse and partially aggregated from other vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colchester|first1=Max|last2=Amiel|first2=Geraldine|title=The IT Boss Who Shuns Email|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204452104577060103165399154?mod=googlenews_wsj|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=5 December 2011|date=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 he was elected ''Strategist of the Year'' by French financial newspaper [[Les Échos (France)|Les Echos]] for his management of Atos.

In May 2015 the company’s market capitalization rose to 7.29 billion euros, an increase of more than 5 billion euros compared with November 2008 when Thierry Breton took over office. The market share price of Atos grew by 268% in five years.

==Minister of Finance==
Having already been proposed twice to succeed [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] as Finance Minister, Thierry Breton was appointed on 24 February 2005, replacing [[Hervé Gaymard]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=de Beaupuy|first1=Francois|last2=Vandore|first2=Emma|title=Chirac Names France Telecom's Breton as New Finance Minister|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aOOf4zt1fvbQ&amp;refer=europe|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=29 February 2012|date=25 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his two and a half years at the head of Bercy he centred his economic policy on the need to reform [[public finances]], specifically in order to reduce debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Paris rediscovers fiscal discipline |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b132c504-4cfb-11db-b03c-0000779e2340.html#axzz3dh1zpbLy |archive-url=https://archive.is/20151222175516/http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b132c504-4cfb-11db-b03c-0000779e2340.html#axzz3dh1zpbLy |dead-url=yes|journal=FT |location= |publisher= |date=26 September 2006 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005 he declared that France ''lives beyond its means'', a sentiment echoing the words of the Prime Minister [[Raymond Barre]] in 1976. He stated to the French people that the entirety of their income tax would serve only to finance the interest payments on the national debt.

A month later he set up a commission presided over by [[BNP Paribas]] CEO [[Michel Pébereau]] which was given the task of ''breaking the pattern of public debt''.

He stipulated the maintenance of [[public deficit]] below a level of 3% of GDP in 2005 and 2006 as his primary goal. At the end of 2005 France’s deficit fell to 2.9% of its GDP after three consecutive years of surpassing the figure of 3%. In 2006 the public deficit was further reduced to 2.5% and public debt was recorded to have dramatically fallen to 63.9% of GDP. For the first time since 1995 the country’s budget was in a situation of primary surplus. At the same time France’s GDP rose by 2.1% in 2006 compared with 1.7% in 2005.

In October 2005 Breton proposed a law on "the modernization of the economy" which was voted in the same year and looked to prioritize SMEs’ access to financial markets, encourage research and promote giving employees a stake in the company’s outcomes. On this occasion he also announced himself in favor of the status of the [[Societas Europaea]] being written into French legislation to allow businesses to operate throughout the EU on the basis of a unified set of financial rules.

At the same time he led a reform for fiscal simplification which attempted to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four and put in place a pre-filled internet based declaration of revenues.

During this period he unveiled the concept of the [[tax shield]], which he would initiate in 2006 at a level of 60% excepting health insurance and social debt reimbursement. This was taken up again by Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 with a lowering of the level to 60% and an inclusion of health insurance and social debt reimbursement.

Thierry Breton wanted France to be the first country to move forward in developing its immaterial heritage. Thus in March 2007 he entrusted a report to [[Maurice Lévy]] and [[Jean-Pierre Jouyet]] on the economy of the immaterial with the goal of creating an agency for the immaterial heritage of the state which ambition would be to valorize the state’s immaterial assets (use of image; brands etc.) This one-of-a-kind agency was put in place on 23 April 2007. This immaterial heritage was recorded as 10 billion euros worth of assets in the state’s annual report in 2010.

In February 2007 the unemployment rate was at 8.4%, the lowest recorded score since June 1983.

He finished his term on 15 May 2007 at the end of Jacques Chirac’s five-year term. The handover of power to [[Jean-Louis Borloo]], named as Minister of the Economy by the newly elected President of the French Republic Nicolas Sarkozy, took place the following day.

==Board member==
He served as director in many boards such as:
[[AXA]]; [[La Poste (France)|La Poste]]; [[Dexia]]; [[Schneider Electric]]; [[Bouygues Telecom]]. He sits today on the board of directors of [[Carrefour]] where he chairs the Compensation and Benefits Committee. He also is member of [[Bank of America]]'s Global Advisory Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/25/nc-bank-of-america-idUSnBw9jFx6fa+110+BSW20130125 |title=Bank of America Forms Global Advisory Council |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=25 January 2013 |website=Reuters |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924173513/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/25/nc-bank-of-america-idUSnBw9jFx6fa+110+BSW20130125 |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zabbix''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] [[network monitoring|monitoring]] software tool for diverse IT components, including [[computer network|networks]], [[Server (computing)|servers]], [[virtual machine]]s (VMs) and [[cloud service]]s. Zabbix provides monitoring metrics, among others network utilization, CPU load and disk space consumption. Zabbix monitoring configuration can be done using XML based templates which contains elements to monitor.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/4.0/manual/config/templates&lt;/ref&gt; The software monitors operations on Linux, Hewlett Packard Unix (HP-UX), Mac OS X, Solaris and other operating systems (OSes); however, Windows monitoring is only possible through agents.
Zabbix can use [[MySQL]], [[MariaDB]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[SQLite]], [[Oracle database|Oracle]] or [[IBM DB2]] to store data.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/3.4/manual/installation/requirements#software List of supported databases in the manual]&lt;/ref&gt; Its backend is written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and the web frontend is written in [[PHP]]. Zabbix offers several monitoring options: 
*Simple checks can verify the availability and responsiveness of standard services such as SMTP or HTTP without installing any software on the monitored host. 
*A Zabbix [[Software agent|agent]] can also be installed on UNIX and Windows hosts to monitor statistics such as CPU load, network utilization, disk space, etc. 
*As an alternative to installing an agent on hosts, Zabbix includes support for monitoring via [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]], [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] checks, as well as over [[Intelligent Platform Management Interface|IPMI]], [[Java Management Extensions|JMX]], [[Secure Shell|SSH]], [[Telnet]] and using custom parameters. Zabbix supports a variety of near-real-time notification mechanisms, including [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]].

Released under the terms of [[GNU General Public License version 2]], Zabbix is [[free software]].

==Development==

Zabbix is primarily developed by a Zabbix LLC company.

===Source code===
Zabbix consists of several separate modules:
* Zabbix Server, not supported in Windows,&lt;ref name="zabbix.com"&gt;https://www.zabbix.com/requirements&lt;/ref&gt; performs the polling and trapping of data, calculates triggers and sends notifications to users, needs a database to store configurations and data.
* Zabbix Agents, installed on the system that is to be monitored to reach out values like CPU/memory usage that can only be accessed from within the OS
* Zabbix Frontend,  web front-end used for setup, configuration and data browsing.
* Zabbix Proxy,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/manual/concepts/proxy&lt;/ref&gt; not supported in Windows, allows to access to systems that can't be reached directly and reduce load on Zabbix Server.&lt;ref name="zabbix.com"/&gt;

While the server, proxy and agents are written in [[C (programming language)|C]], the front-end is implemented in [[PHP]] and [[Javascript]]. A [[Java (programming language)|Java]] gateway is also available since Zabbix 2.0.

===Releases===

Since the first stable version was released as 1.0, Zabbix versioning has used minor version numbers to denote major releases. Each minor release actually implements many new features, while change level releases mostly introduce bugfixes.

Zabbix version numbering scheme has changed over time. While the first two stable branches were 1.0 and 1.1, after 1.1 it was decided to use odd numbers for development versions and even numbers for stable versions. As a result, 1.3 followed 1.1 as a development release to be released as 1.4.
