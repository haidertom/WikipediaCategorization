      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7407">An '''abstract family of acceptors (AFA)''' is a grouping of generalized [[Finite state machine#Acceptors_and_recognizers|acceptors]]. Informally, an acceptor is a device with a finite state control, a finite number of input symbols, and an internal store with a read and write function. Each acceptor has a start state and a set of accepting states. The device reads a sequence of symbols, transitioning from state to state for each input symbol. If the device ends in an accepting state, the device is said to accept the sequence of symbols. A family of acceptors is a set of acceptors with the same type of internal store. The study of AFA is part of AFL ([[abstract family of languages|abstract families of languages]]) theory. &lt;ref name="Seymour"&gt;[[Seymour Ginsburg]], ''Algebraic and automata theoretic properties of formal languages'', North-Holland, 1975, {{ISBN|0-7204-2506-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal definitions==

===AFA Schema===
An ''AFA Schema'' is an ordered 4-tuple &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma, I, f, g)&lt;/math&gt;, where
# &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are nonempty abstract sets.
# &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the ''write'' function: &lt;math&gt;f : \Gamma^* \times I \rightarrow \Gamma^* \cup \{\empty\}&lt;/math&gt; (N.B. * is the [[Kleene star]] operation).
# &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the ''read'' function, a mapping from &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt; into the finite subsets of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;g (\epsilon) = \{ \epsilon \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;g(\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. (N.B. &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the empty word).
# For each &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;g(\Gamma^*)&lt;/math&gt;, there is an element &lt;math&gt;1_\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma', 1_\gamma) = \gamma'&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\gamma'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;g(\gamma')&lt;/math&gt;.
# For each ''u'' in ''I'', there exists a finite set &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_u&lt;/math&gt;  ⊆ &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, such that if &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1&lt;/math&gt;  ⊆ &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1^*&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma,u) \ne \empty&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma,u)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma_1 \cup \Gamma_u)^*&lt;/math&gt;.

===Abstract family of acceptors===
An ''abstract family of acceptors (AFA)'' is an ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; such that:
#&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is an ordered 6-tuple (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;), where
## (&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;) is an AFA schema; and
## &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; are infinite abstract sets
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the family of all acceptors &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; = (&lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;), where
##&lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;  are finite subsets of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; respectively, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; ⊆ &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt;; and
##&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; (called the ''transition'' function) is a mapping from &lt;math&gt;K_1 \times  (\Sigma_1 \cup \{ \epsilon \}) \times g(\Gamma^*)&lt;/math&gt; into the finite subsets of &lt;math&gt;K_1 \times I&lt;/math&gt; such that the set &lt;math&gt;G_D = \{ \gamma &lt;/math&gt; | &lt;math&gt;\delta(q,a,\gamma) &lt;/math&gt; ≠ ø for some &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a \}&lt;/math&gt; is finite.


For a given acceptor, let &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; be the relation on &lt;math&gt;K_1 \times  \Sigma_1^* \times \Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt; defined by: For &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1 \cup \{ \epsilon \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(p,aw,\gamma) \vdash (p',w,\gamma')&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a &lt;math&gt;\overline{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\overline{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;g(\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(p',u)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\delta(p,a,\overline{\gamma})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma,u)=\gamma'&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\vdash^*&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;.


Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; be an AFA and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; = (&lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;) be in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt;L(D)&lt;/math&gt; to be the set &lt;math&gt;\{ w \in \Sigma_1^* | \exists q \in F . (q_0,w,\epsilon) \vdash^* (q,\epsilon,\epsilon)\}&lt;/math&gt;. For each subset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{E}) = \{L(D) | D \in \mathcal{E} \}&lt;/math&gt;.


Define &lt;math&gt;L_f(D)&lt;/math&gt; to be the set &lt;math&gt;\{ w \in \Sigma_1^* | \exists(q \in F)\exists(\gamma \in \Gamma^*) . (q_0,w,\epsilon) \vdash^* (q,\epsilon,\gamma)\}&lt;/math&gt;. For each subset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_f(\mathcal{E}) = \{L_f(D) | D \in \mathcal{E} \}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Informal discussion==

===AFA Schema===
An AFA schema defines a store or memory with read and write function. The symbols in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; are called ''storage symbols'' and the symbols in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are called ''instructions''. The write function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; returns a new storage state given the current storage state and an instruction. The read function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; returns the current state of memory. Condition (3) insures the empty storage configuration is distinct from other configurations. Condition (4)  requires there be an identity instruction that allows the state of memory to remain unchanged while the acceptor changes state or advances the input. Condition (5) assures that the set of storage symbols for any given acceptor is finite.

===Abstract family of acceptors===
An AFA is the set of all acceptors over a given pair of state and input alphabets which have the same storage mechanism defined by a given AFA schema. The &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; relation defines one step in the operation of an acceptor.  &lt;math&gt;L_f(D)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of words accepted by acceptor &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; by having the acceptor enter an accepting state. &lt;math&gt;L(D)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of words accepted by acceptor &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; by having the acceptor simultaneously enter an accepting state and having an empty storage.

The abstract acceptors defined by AFA are generalizations of other types of acceptors (e.g. [[finite state automata]], [[pushdown automata]], etc.). They have a finite state control like other automata, but their internal storage may vary widely from the stacks and tapes used in classical automata.

==Results from AFL theory==
The main result from AFL theory is that a family of languages &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is a full AFL if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; for some AFA &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt;.  Equally important is the result that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is a full semi-AFL if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_f(\mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; for some AFA &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Origins==

[[Seymour Ginsburg]] of the [[University of Southern California]] and [[Sheila Greibach]] of [[Harvard University]] first presented their AFL theory paper at the [[IEEE]] Eighth Annual Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory in 1967.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2891921 IEEE conference record of 1967 Eighth Annual Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory] : papers presented at the Eighth Annual Symposium, University of Texas, October 18-20, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4412">'''Aceramic''' is defined as "not producing pottery". In [[archaeology]], the term means "without [[pottery]]".

Aceramic societies usually used bark, basketry, gourds and leather for containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?terms=aceramic|title = Archaeology Wordsmith|website = www.archaeologywordsmith.com|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes used to refer to a specific early [[Neolithic]] period before a culture develops [[Pottery|ceramics]], such as the Middle Eastern [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]], in which case it is a synonym of '''preceramic''' (or '''pre-pottery''').

It should be distinguished from the specific term '''Pre-Ceramic''', which is a period in many chronologies of the [[archaeology of the Americas]], typically showing some [[agriculture]] and developed [[textile]]s but no fired [[pottery]].  For example, in the [[Norte Chico civilization]] and other cultures of [[Peru]], the cultivation of [[cotton]] seems to have been very important in economic and power relations, from around 3200 BC. Here, [[Cotton Pre-Ceramic]] may be used as a period. The "Pre-Ceramic" may be followed by "Ceramic" periods or a [[formative stage]].&lt;ref&gt;Stone-Miller, Rebecca, ''Art of the Andes'', pp. 7, 18-23, 2002 (2nd edn), Thames &amp; Hudson, World of Art series, {{ISBN|0500203636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Aceramic" is also used to describe a culture at any time prior to its development of pottery as well as cultures that lack pottery altogether. A '''preceramic''' period is traditionally regarded as occurring in the early stage of the [[Neolithic]] period of a culture, but recent findings in Japan and China have pushed the origin of ceramic technology there well back into the [[Paleolithic]] era.

The Aceramic Neolithic period began roughly around 8500 BC and can be identified with over a half a dozen sites. The period was most prominent in Western Asia in an economy based on the cultivation of crops or the rearing of animals or both. Aceramic Neolithic groups are more rare outside Western Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?terms=aceramic|title = Archaeology Wordsmith|website = www.archaeologywordsmith.com|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aceramic Neolithic villages had many attributes of agricultural communities: large settlement size, substantial architecture, long settlement duration, intensive harvesting of seeds with sickles, equipment and facilities for storing and grinding seeds, and containers. Morphological evidence for domestication of plants comes only from Middle PPNB ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]), and by Late PPNB some animals, notably goats, were domesticated or at least managed in most of the sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-0023-0_1|title = Aceramic Neolithic|last = Banning|first = Edward|date = 2002-01-01|publisher = Springer US|isbn = 9781468471359|editor-last = Peregrine|editor-first = Peter N.|pages = 1–20|language = en|doi = 10.1007/978-1-4615-0023-0_1|editor-last2 = Ember|editor-first2 = Melvin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sites ==
Some of the most famous Aceramic sites are located in the [[Republic of Cyprus]]. There was an Early Aceramic Neolithic phase beginning around 8200 BC. The phase can be best thought of as a "colony", or initial settlement of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.brynmawr.edu/collections/nehinterns/cypriote/akrotiri-neolithic.html|title = Untitled Document|website = www.brynmawr.edu|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the relatively recent discoveries of the Akrotiri and the Early Aceramic Neolithic phases, the Aceramic Neolithic culture known as the Khirokitia culture was thought to be the earliest human settlement on Cyprus, from 7000 to 5000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.brynmawr.edu/collections/nehinterns/cypriote/aceramicneolithic.html|title = Untitled Document|website = www.brynmawr.edu|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of Late Aceramic Neolithic sites throughout the island. The two most important are called Khirokitia and Kalavasos-Tenta. Late Aceramic Cyprus did not have much external contact because of a lack of settlement in the west or northwest during the period. However, Late Aceramic Cyprus was a well-structured society.

In [[molecular biology]], an '''amplicon''' is a piece of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that is the source and/or product of [[amplification (molecular biology)|amplification]] or [[DNA replication|replication]] events. It can be formed artificially, using various methods including [[polymerase chain reaction]]s (PCR) or [[ligase chain reaction]]s (LCR), or naturally through [[gene duplication]]. In this context, ''amplification'' refers to the production of one or more copies of a genetic fragment or target sequence, specifically the amplicon. As it refers to the product of an amplification reaction, ''amplicon'' is used interchangeably with common laboratory terms, such as "PCR product."

Amplicons in general are [[direct repeat]] (head-to-tail) or [[inverted repeat]] (head-to-head or tail-to-tail) genetic sequences, and can be either linear or circular in structure.&lt;ref name=Cohn&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cohn|editor1-first=Waldo E. |editor2-last=Moldave |editor2-first=Kivie |title=Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology |year=1996 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-540054-1 |pages=280–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circular amplicons consist of imperfect inverted duplications [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics#Annealing|annealed]] into a circle&lt;ref name=Grondin&gt;{{cite journal |year=1996 |last1=Grodin |first1=K |last2=Roy |first2=G |last3=Ouellette |first3=M |title= Formation of extrachromosomal circular amplicons with direct or inverted duplications in drug-resistant Leishmania tarentolae. |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=3587–3595 |journal=Mol.

During artificial amplification, amplicon length is dictated by the experimental goals.&lt;ref&gt;PCR Primer Design Guidelines. Premier Biosoft: Accelerating Research in Life Sciences. Retrieved from: http://www.premierbiosoft.com/tech_notes/PCR_Primer_Design.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

Analysis of amplicons has been made possible by the development of amplification methods such as [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], and increasingly by cheaper and more [[High-throughput screening|high-throughput]] technologies for [[DNA sequencing]] or [[DNA sequencing#Next-generation methods|next-generation sequencing]], such as [[ion semiconductor sequencing]], popularly referred to as the brand of the developer, Ion Torrent.&lt;ref name="ion torrent"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iontorrent.com/ |title=Ion Torrent Official Webpage |access-date=2018-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106192756/http://www.iontorrent.com/ |archive-date=2012-11-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA sequencing technologies such as next-generation sequencing have made it possible to study amplicons in [[Genome Biology|genome biology]] and [[genetics]], including [[Genetics of cancer|cancer genetics]] research,&lt;ref name="International Cancer Genome Consortium"&gt;[http://icgc.org International Cancer Genome Consortium Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] research, and [[human genetics]].&lt;ref name="National Human Genome Research Institute Official Website"&gt;[http://www.genome.gov National Human Genome Research Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, using the [[16S rRNA]] gene, which is part of every bacterial and archaeal genome and is highly conserved, bacteria can be taxonomically classified by comparison of the amplicon sequence to known sequences. This works similarly in the fungal domain with the [[18S rRNA]] gene.

Irrespective of the approach used to amplify the amplicons, some technique must be used to quantitate the amplified product.&lt;ref name="Stanley"&gt;Stanley, J. (2002). Essentials of Immunology &amp; Serology by Jacqueline Stanley. Albany, NY: Delmar.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, these techniques incorporate a capture step and a detection step, although how these steps are incorporated depends on the individual [[assay]].

Examples include the Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Assay ([[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|RT-PCR]]), which has the capacity to recognize [[HIV]] in [[Blood plasma|plasma]]; the HIV-1 QT ([[NASBA (molecular biology)|NASBA]]), which is used to measure plasma [[viral load]] by amplifying a segment of the HIV RNA; and Transcription Mediated Amplification, which employs a hybridization protection assay to distinguish ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'' infections.&lt;ref name="Stanley"/&gt; Various detection and capture steps are involved in each approach to assess the amplification product, or amplicon. With amplicon sequencing the high number of different amplicons resulting from amplification of a usual sample are concatenated and sequenced. After quality control classification is done by different methods, the counts of identical taxa representing their relative abundance in the sample.

==Applications==

PCR can be used to determine sex from a human DNA sample.&lt;ref name=Mannucci&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01371335 |title=Forensic application of a rapid and quantitative DNA sex test by amplification of the X-Y homologous gene amelogenin |year=1994 |last1=Mannucci |first1=Armando |last2=Sullivan |first2=Kevin M. |last3=Ivanov |first3=Pavel L. |last4=Gill |first4=Peter |journal=International Journal of Legal Medicine |volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=190–3 |pmid=8038111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[locus (genetics)|loci]] of [[Alu element]] insertion is selected, amplified and evaluated in terms of size of the fragment. The sex assay utilizes AluSTXa for the [[X chromosome]], AluSTYa for the [[Y chromosome]], or both AluSTXa and AluSTYa, to reduce the possibility of error to a negligible quantity. The inserted chromosome yields a large fragment when the [[Homologous chromosome|homologous region]] is amplified. The males are distinguished as having two DNA amplicons present, while females have only a single amplicon. The kit adapted for carrying out the method includes a pair of primers to amplify the locus and optionally polymerase chain reaction reagents.&lt;ref name=Hedges&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0003-2697(02)00430-X |title=Mobile element-based assay for human gender determination |year=2003 |last1=Hedges |first1=Dale J |last2=Walker |first2=Jerilyn A |last3=Callinan |first3=Pauline A |last4=Shewale |first4=Jaiprakash G |last5=Sinha |first5=Sudhir K |last6=Batzer |first6=Mark A |journal=Analytical Biochemistry |volume=312 |pages=77–9 |pmid=12479838 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LCR can be used to diagnose [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=T M|title=The ligase chain reaction as a primary screening tool for the detection of culture positive tuberculosis|journal=Thorax|date=1 November 2000|volume=55|issue=11|pages=955–957|doi=10.1136/thorax.55.11.955|pmid=11050266|pmc=1745641}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence containing protein [[antigen]] B is targeted by four [[oligonucleotide]] [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]]—two for the [[sense strand]], and two for the [[Sense (molecular biology)#Antisense DNA|antisense strand]]. The primers bind adjacent to one another, forming a segment of double stranded DNA that once separated, can serve as a target for future rounds of replication. In this instance, the product can be detected via the [[Enzyme immunoassay|microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA)]].

A '''breath mark''' or '''luftpause''' is a [[symbol]] used in [[musical notation]].  It directs the performer of the music passage to take a breath (for [[wind instrument]]s and [[vocalist]]s) or to make a slight pause (for non-wind [[musical instrument|instrument]]s). This pause is normally intended to shorten the duration of the preceding [[Musical note|note]] and not to alter the [[tempo]]; in this function it can be thought of as a [[grace note|grace]] [[rest (music)|rest]].  It is usually placed above the [[staff (music)|staff]] and at the ends of [[phrase (music)|phrase]]s.  Its function is analogous to the [[comma (punctuation)|comma]] in several [[written language]]s.  Indeed, the two symbols look identical.

[[Buddhism]] played an important role in the development of [[Japanese art]] between the 6th and the 16th centuries. [[Buddhist art]] and [[Buddhist]] religious thought came to Japan from [[China]] through [[Korea]] and Buddhist art was encouraged by Crown [[Prince Shōtoku]] in the [[Suiko]] period in the sixth century and by [[Emperor Shōmu]] in the [[Nara period]] in the eighth century. In the early [[Heian period]] Buddhist art and architecture greatly influenced the traditional [[Shinto]] arts, and Buddhist painting became fashionable among wealthy Japanese. The Kamakura period saw a flowering of Japanese Buddhist sculpture, whose origins are in the works of Heian period sculptor [[Jōchō]]. &lt;!--Many of the great artists from [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara]] during the [[Kamakura period]] were also [[Buddhist monks]].
--&gt;
The [[Amitabha|Amida]] sect of Buddhism provided the basis for many popular artworks. Buddhist art became popular among the masses via [[Emakimono|scroll paintings]], paintings used in worship and paintings of [[Buddhas]], [[saint]]'s lives, [[hell]]s and other religious themes. Under the [[Zen]] sect of Buddhism, portraiture of priests such as Bodhidharma became popular as well as scroll calligraphy and sumi-e brush painting.

==Asuka and Nara periods==

[[File:Shakyamuni Triad Horyuji.JPG|thumb|Shakyamuni Triad by Tori Busshi depicts the Buddha Shakyamuni in the traditional sixth-century Chinese style with an elongated head and in front of a flaming mandorla - a lotus petal shaped cloud.]]

Buddhist art was introduced to Japan along with the Buddhist religion in the mid-sixth century, when according to tradition, [[Seong of Baekje]] sent a statue of the Buddha along with some sutras to the [[Emperor Kinmei]]. The [[Asuka period]] (552–645) saw the gradual growth of Chinese and Korean artistic and religious influences on Japanese culture. Chinese influence grew in the Nara Period (645–784) as the Japanese court began to model itself in a Chinese form, and Buddhism continued to spread throughout Japan, while integrating within it the Japanese religion of Shinto. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 211.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture of this period shows, as do most all subsequent sculpture, the influence of continental art. [[Tori Busshi]] a descendant of a Chinese immigrant followed the style of [[Northern Wei]] sculpture and established what has come to be known as the Tori school of sculpture. Notable examples of Tori works are the Sakyamuni Triad (or Shaka triad) which are the main icons of the Golden Hall of [[Hōryū-ji]] temple and the [[kannon]] [[Boddhisatva]] of Yumedono Hall of the same temple, also known as Guze Kannon. First built in the early 7th century as the private temple of Crown [[Prince Shōtoku]], [[Hōryū-ji]] consists of 41 independent buildings. The most important ones, the main worship hall, or ''Kondō'' (Golden Hall), and ''Gojū-no-tō'' (Five-story [[Pagoda]]), stand in the center of an open area surrounded by a roofed cloister. Inside the ''Kondō'', on a large rectangular platform, are some of the most important sculptures of the period including the Sakyamuni triad.

In the Sakyamuni Triad, [[Gautama Buddha|Sakyamuni]], the center Buddha, is attended by two other figures, [[Bhaisajyaguru]] to its right and [[Amitabha|Amitābha]] to its left. The statues are dated to 623.&lt;ref name="ISBN477002939X"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN477002939X&amp;id=zMC4RMXQkn0C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;vq=kannon&amp;dq=chuguji+miroku&amp;sig=Z5IBZpP5m89CZxi3XUnwfbEBsh4|title=Discovering the Arts of Japan: A Historical Overview, p42|accessdate=2007-04-03|publisher=Kodansha International|year=2003|author=Tsuneko S.

The Early Nara period saw a move towards more naturalistic styles emerging from China. The Triad of Yakushi shows the healing Buddha which presides over the Eastern Pure Land attended by two Bodhisattvas Nikko and Gakko. The triad, housed in the Yakushiji temple (7th century in Nara), reveals Chinese and central Asian influences in its anatomical definition, naturalism and realistic drapery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 212.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sculpture also demonstrates the roots of Japanese art in the 1st-3rd century CE [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], characterized by flowing dress patterns and realistic rendering,&lt;ref&gt;"Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style" (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p19)&lt;/ref&gt; on which Chinese and Korean artistic traits were superimposed. After the [[Northern Wei|Chinese Northern Wei]] buddhist art had infiltrated a Korean peninsula, Buddhist icons was brought Japan by Korean immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Influence on Early Japanese Buddhist Sculpture [http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000593748&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002169717&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;menu_cd=0000008845&amp;menu_code=&amp;image_folder=color_11&amp;bg_color=2B5137&amp;line_color=3A6A4A&amp;menu_type= buddhapia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111194158/http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000593748&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002169717&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;menu_cd=0000008845&amp;menu_code=&amp;image_folder=color_11&amp;bg_color=2B5137&amp;line_color=3A6A4A&amp;menu_type= |date=2011-01-11 }} "One must stress the obvious point that since Korean Buddhist art is directly based on developments in China, ultimately a study of Korean influence on Japan must be rooted in an understanding of the Chinese impact on Korea.""Since the territory of the Northern Wei was adjacent to that of Koguryo, it is natural that the Buddhist ideas and art current at the Northern Wei court would flow directly to Koguryo. ""It should also be pointed out that there was considerable influence from Koguryo on the southern kingdoms of Paekche and Silla even though Paekche also received direct influence from south China, as was mentioned above.""I have argued that various groups, including official envoys, monks and students, as well as Korean settlers, were responsible for bringing Korean icons to Japan."&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Ancient Greek art style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the [[Kōryū-ji]] [[Maitreya|Miroku]] Bosatsu and the [[Chūgū-ji]] [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]] statues.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Three Kingdoms of Korea, and particularly Baekje, were instrumental as active agents in the introduction and formation of a Buddhist tradition in Japan in 538 or 552.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN070071605X&amp;id=e1BzL2lwPqEC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=korean+buddhist+art&amp;sig=4XlpYzvL4PF3TKAR7BO3ZwFBXbg]&lt;/ref&gt;
They illustrate the terminal point of the [[Silk Road transmission of art]] during the first few centuries of our era. Other examples can be found in the development of the iconography of the Japanese [[Fūjin]] Wind God,&lt;ref&gt;"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins.&amp;nbsp;... One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]/ Oado." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p21)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Niō]] guardians,&lt;ref&gt;"The origin of the image of [[Vajrapani]] should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modeled after that of Hercules.&amp;nbsp;... The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterward transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities (Niō)." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p23)&lt;/ref&gt; and the near-[[classical antiquity|Classical]] floral patterns in temple decorations.&lt;ref&gt;The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple building in the 8th century was focused around the [[Tōdai-ji]] in Nara. Constructed as the headquarters for a network of temples in each of the provinces, the Tōdaiji is the most ambitious religious complex erected in the early centuries of Buddhist worship in Japan. Appropriately, the 16.2&amp;nbsp;m (53&amp;nbsp;ft) Buddha (completed 752) enshrined in the main Buddha hall, or ''Daibutsuden'', is a [[Rushana]] Buddha, the figure that represents the essence of Buddhahood, just as the Tōdaiji represented the center for Imperially sponsored Buddhism and its dissemination throughout Japan. Only a few fragments of the original statue survive, and the present hall and central Buddha are reconstructions from the [[Edo period]].

Under the [[Ritsuryō]] system of government in the [[Nara period]], Buddhism was heavily regulated by the state through the {{nihongo|Sōgō|僧綱||''Office of Priestly Affairs''}}.  During this time, Tōdai-ji served as the central administrative temple for the provincial temples&lt;ref name="abe"&gt;{{cite book | last = Abe | first = Ryuichi | title = The Weaving of Mantra: Kukai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-231-11286-6 | pages=35, 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Buddhism in Japan#Nara Period|six Buddhist schools in Japan]] at the time.

==[[Heian period]] (794–1185)==
[[File:Taizokai.jpg|thumb|right|Taizokai (Womb World) mandala, second half of ninth century. Hanging scroll, color on silk. The center square represents the young stage of [[Vairocana]] Buddha.]]

In 784, the [[Emperor Kanmu]] threatened by the growing secular power of the Buddhist institutions in Nara moved the capital to [[Heian-kyō]] (Kyōto), which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst 2007 p.32&lt;/ref&gt; The term Heian period refers to the years between 794 and 1185, when the [[Kamakura shogunate]] was established at the end of the [[Genpei War]]. The period is further divided into the early Heian and the late Heian, or Fujiwara era, the pivotal date being 894, the year imperial embassies to China were officially discontinued.

[[Buddhism]] began to spread throughout Japan during the Heian period, primarily through two major esoteric sects, [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]]. Tendai originated in [[China]] and is based on the [[Lotus Sutra]], one of the most important [[sutra]]s of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism; [[Saichō]] was key to its transmission to Japan. [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] (true word school) is an indigenous sect with close affiliations to Chinese influenced Buddhist thought founded by [[Kūkai]] (best known by his posthumous title Kōbō Daishi, 774–835) who traveled to China and studied Indian and Chinese Buddhism, as well as Chinese calligraphy and poetry. Emperor Kanmu himself was a notable patron of the [[Tendai]] sect, which rose to great power over the ensuing centuries. Kūkai greatly impressed the emperors who succeeded [[Emperor Kanmu]], and also generations of Japanese, not only with his holiness but also with his poetry, calligraphy, painting, and sculpture. Shingon Buddhist practice is based on various rituals, including the chanting of [[mantras]], [[Puja (Buddhism)|puja]], hand gestures ([[mudras]]) and meditation through visualization of [[mandala]]s. The central role of ritual in Japanese esoteric Buddhism led to a flourishing of the religious arts in the Heian period. These religious paintings, mandalas and statues provided practitioners with a way to contemplate on Buddhist deities and concepts. A famous example of Shingon Mandala is the Taizokai (Womb World) mandala. Part of the [[Mandala of the Two Realms]], the womb world is composed of 12 zones representing different dimensions of Buddha nature.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p215"&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 215.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the center sits the [[Vairocana]] Buddha within the lotus of compassion surrounded by attendant Buddhas and [[Bodhisattva]]s. The Shingon sect believed that all beings have an innate Buddha nature.
&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p215"/&gt;

The temples erected for the Shingon sect such as that at [[Mt. Kōya]] were built in the Kii mountains, far away from the Court and the laity in the capital. The irregular topography of these sites forced Japanese architects to rethink the problems of temple construction, and in so doing to choose more indigenous elements of design. Cypress-bark roofs replaced those of ceramic tile, wood planks were used instead of earthen floors, and a separate worship area for the laity was added in front of the main sanctuary. The temple that best reflects the spirit of early Heian Shingon temples is the Murō-ji (early 9th century), set deep in a stand of cypress trees on a mountain southeast of Nara.

In the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara period]], [[Pure Land|Pure Land Buddhism]], which offered easy salvation through belief in [[Amitabha|Amida]] (the Buddha of the Western Paradise), became popular. This period is named after the [[Fujiwara clan]], then the most powerful in the country, who ruled as [[Sesshō and Kampaku|regents]] for the Emperor, becoming, in effect, civil dictators. Concurrently, the Kyoto nobility developed a society devoted to elegant aesthetic pursuits. 
The ''Hō-ō-dō'' (Phoenix Hall, completed 1053) of the [[Byōdō-in]], a temple in [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] to the southeast of Kyoto, is the exemplar of Fujiwara Amida halls. It consists of a main rectangular structure flanked by two L-shaped wing corridors and a tail corridor, set at the edge of a large artificial pond. Inside, a single golden image of Amida (c. 1053) is installed on a high platform. The Amida sculpture was executed by [[Jōchō]], who popularized the Chinese technique of creating a work from several smaller pieces of sculpted wood (''[[yosegi]]''). Although it limited the amount of surface detail the artist could carve into each piece, the method forced the sculptor to convey his intended message within these limits. This resulted in more refined and ephemeral-looking pieces.&lt;ref name="Paine-p93"&gt;Paine 93.&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, it allowed several assistants to work on the sculpture at once, greatly speeding the process.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163"&gt;Noma 163.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jōchō]], as the master, did the finishing work.&lt;ref name="Mason-p144"&gt;Mason 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The technique also led to systematized [[Body proportions|proportion]]s of body parts and simple surface details, as these sped the creation of the constituent parts and the formation of the finished piece.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163" /&gt;

Art historians often cite this new [[canon (art)|canon]] of proportions as evidence of Jōchō's genius. He based the measurements on a unit equal to the distance between the sculpted figure's chin and hairline. The distance between each knee is equal to the distance from the bottoms of the legs to the hair.&lt;ref name="Mason-p144" /&gt; The widely spaced and level knees thus form the base of a triangular design, conveying a feeling of stability and peace. The effect is further accentuated by the contrast of other elements in the design, particularly the figures' [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]s. These are intricately detailed, featuring dancing [[tennin]], clouds, and flames.&lt;ref name="Paine-p93" /&gt; Jōchō's sculptures' expressions convey compassion and elegance, and the detailed and precise carving of the facial features projects a certain kindness.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163" /&gt;

The workshop method of dividing work among several craftsmen caught on, as did Jōchō's style. His school was imitated by sculptors across Japan for the over next 150 years, as Japanese sculpture devolved into a conformist orthodoxy before being reinvented in the Kamakura period.&lt;ref&gt;Shively and McCullogh 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rising importance of Pure Land sects of Japanese Buddhism in the tenth century, new image-types were developed to satisfy the devotional needs of these sects. These include Raigozu (来迎図), which depict Amida Buddha along with attendant Bodhisattvas Kannon and Seishi arriving to welcome the souls of the faithful departed to Amida's Western Paradise. A noted early example dating from 1053 are painted on the interior of the Phoenix Hall of the Byōdō-in, a temple in Uji, Kyoto. This is also considered an early example of so-called [[Yamato-e]] (大和絵), or "Japanese-style painting", insofar as it includes landscape elements such as soft rolling hills that seem to reflect something of the actual appearance of the landscape of western Japan. Stylistically, however, this type of painting continues to be informed by Tang Dynasty Chinese "blue and green style" landscape painting traditions. "Yamato-e" is an imprecise term that continues to be debated among historians of Japanese art.

==[[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333)==
[[File:Seshin Vasubandhu Kofukuji.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Seshin]] (Vasubandhu), Wood, 186cm height, CE1208,The Northern Octagonal Hall of Kofukuji Temple, by [[Unkei]]]]

Japan suffered a series of civil wars in the late 12th century between several rival families, which eventually led to the rise of the feudalistic [[Kamakura shogunate]], so named because the victorious family, the [[Minamoto clan]], established their political base in Kamakura. The Emperor remained in Kyoto as a figurehead but the actual political power rested with the ''[[shōgun]]''. The Kamakura period saw the reestablishment of cultural ties with China, as well as the growth of [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Pure Land Buddhism]] as the two major branches of Japanese Buddhism.

These new Kamakura patrons also favored a more realistic and naturalistic art which is exemplified by the sculpture of the [[Kei school]]. The Kei school developed out of that led by the ''[[busshi]]'' (Buddhist sculptor) [[Jōchō]], his successor [[Kakujō]], and Kakujō's son [[Raijō]], the leading sculptors of the preceding generations. These artists are sometimes said to have founded the Kei school;&lt;ref name=jaanus&gt;"[http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/keiha.htm Keiha]." ''Japanese Architecture and Art Users System (JAANUS).'' 2001. Accessed 17 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the school would not come into its own, and become associated with the name "Kei" until Raijō was succeeded by [[Kōkei (sculptor)|Kōkei]] and [[Unkei]] around the year 1200.

Among sculptors of the [[Kei school]], [[Unkei]] is the most famous and considered to be the most accomplished sculptor of the period.&lt;ref name="Varley 94"&gt;Varley 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his works, a pair of large [[Nio]] (or Kongō Rikishi) in Tōdai-ji depict muscular guardians in a dramatic [[contrapposto]] stance.&lt;ref&gt;Mason 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Unkei's sculptures of Indian priests Mujaku and Seshin in [[Kōfuku-ji]] demonstrate a new portrait-like realism.&lt;ref&gt;Noma 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Both statues sport priestly vestments that frame their bodies realistically. They stand life-size and alone and are fully sculpted in the round as if intended to be viewed from any angle. Mujaku is depicted as a thin man manipulating some sort of holy, cloth-wrapped object. He appears reserved and reflective. Seshin, in contrast, is depicted in mid conversation, gesturing and speaking, an extroverted counterweight to the solemn Mujaku.&lt;ref&gt;Mason 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The men are shown as specific people, not simply members of a stock type.&lt;ref name="Paine 112"&gt;Paine 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Unkei]] had six sculptor sons and their work is also imbued with the new humanism. Tankei, the eldest son and a brilliant sculptor became the head of the studio. [[Kōshō]], the 4th son produced a remarkable sculpture of the 10th-century Japanese Buddhist teacher Kuya (903–972). [[Kaikei]] was a collaborator of [[Unkei]] and worked with him on the [[Nio]] statues in 1203. He worked with priest Chogen (1121–1206): the director of Tōdai-ji reconstruction project. Many of his figures are more idealized than Unkei and his sons, and are characterized by a beautifully finished surface, richly decorated with pigments and gold. His works have survived more than 40, many of which are signed by himself.

Much of the cities of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] and [[Kyoto]] were destroyed in the [[Genpei War]] of 1180–1185. The [[Kei school]] was granted the opportunity to restore Nara's greatest temples, the [[Tōdai-ji]] and [[Kōfuku-ji]], replacing their Buddhist sculptures. The leading figure in this effort was Shunjobo Chogen (1121–1206), who was known to have made three trips to China to study sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 218.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tōdai-ji restoration project lasted several generations, from roughly 1180 to 1212,&lt;ref name=munsterberg&gt;Munsterberg, Huge. ''The Arts of Japan: An Illustrated History''. Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1957. p98.&lt;/ref&gt; and drew extensively on [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] Chinese styles, introducing new stylistic elements while remaining true to tradition.

Some of the most popular paintings of the Kamakura period depict an ascending Amida Buddha. The main tenet of Pure Land Buddhism is that chanting the name of Amida could lead to a reincarnation in the pure land. Thus, scrolls of Amida would be hung in the room of the dying who would be saved by chanting the Amida mantra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 220.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Kamakura period new Buddhists sects, such as Kegon and Nichiren emerged and grew in popularity. These sects produced several distinct genres of painting, including the [[Suijako]] paintings, which tried to reconcile the two main Japanese faiths by depicting Shinto deities as early manifestations of Buddha. Works like the Kegon Engi Emaki, a book illustrated to help people understand complicated Chinese character, became more popular with ordinary people. Emakimono, or long illustrated hand scrolls, also served to illustrate the life of the Buddha and the history of key Buddhist leaders.

==[[Muromachi period]] (1333–1573)==

[[File:Sesshu - Haboku-Sansui.jpg|thumb|upright|{{Nihongo|''Splashed-ink Landscape''|破墨山水|''[[Haboku sansui]]''}}, [[Sesshū]], 1495, ink on silk, 148.6 × 32.7 cm]]

During the [[Muromachi period]], also called the Ashikaga period, a profound change took place in Japanese culture. The [[Ashikaga clan]] took control of the shogunate and moved its headquarters back to Kyoto, to the Muromachi district of the city. With the return of government to the capital, the popularizing trends of the Kamakura period came to an end, and cultural expression took on a more aristocratic, elitist character. During the Muromachi Period, [[Zen Buddhism]] rose to prominence especially among the elite [[Samurai]] class, who embraced the Zen values of personal discipline, concentration and self-development. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 736.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the great Zen monasteries in Kamakura and Kyoto had a major impact on the visual arts. Because of secular ventures and trading missions to China organized by Zen temples, many Chinese paintings and objects of art were imported into Japan and profoundly influenced Japanese artists working for Zen temples and the shogunate. Not only did these imports change the subject matter of painting, but they also modified the use of color; the bright colors of [[Yamato-e]] yielded to the monochromes of painting in the Chinese manner of Sui-boku-ga (水墨画) or [[sumi-e]] (墨絵), this style mainly used only black ink — the same as used in East Asian calligraphy.

[[File:Shubun - Reading in a Bamboo Grove detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of "Reading in a Bamboo Grove", 1446, [[Shūbun]]]]

The foremost painter of the new [[Sumi-e]] style was [[Sesshū Tōyō]] (1420–1506), a [[Rinzai]] priest who traveled to China in 1468–69 and studied contemporary Ming painting. Some of his most dramatic works are in the Chinese splashed-ink (Haboku) style.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p737"&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 737.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to Japan, Sesshū built himself a studio and established a large following, painters that are now referred to as the Unkoku-rin school or "School of Sesshū". To make one of the calligraphic and highly stylized Haboku paintings, the painter would visualize the image and then made swift broad strokes into the paper resulting in a splashed and abstract composition, all done with meditative concentration. This impressionistic style of painting was supposed to capture the true nature of the subject. The [[Sumi-e]] style was highly influenced by calligraphy, using the same tools and style as well as its zen philosophy.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p737"/&gt; To paint in this style the practitioner had to clear his mind and apply the brush strokes without too much thinking, termed {{nihongo|''[[mushin (mental state)|mushin]]''|無心|"no mind state"}} by the Japanese philosopher [[Nishida Kitaro]].&lt;ref name="yuko"&gt;{{cite web |title=Shodo History |url=http://www.zenshodo.com/history.htm |author=Solana Yuko Halada |work=Japanese Calligraphy in Zen Spirit |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102204715/http://www.zenshodo.com/history.htm |archivedate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[mushin (mental state)|mushin]] is central to many Japanese arts including the art of the sword, archery and the tea ceremony.

By the end of the 14th century, monochrome landscape paintings (sansuiga) had found patronage by the ruling Ashikaga family and was the preferred genre among Zen painters, gradually evolving from its Chinese roots to a more Japanese style. Another important painter in this period is [[Tenshō Shūbun]], a monk at the Kyoto temple of [[Shōkoku-ji]] who traveled to Korea and studied under Chinese painters. He returned to Japan in 1404 and settled in Kyoto, then the capital city. He became director of the court painting bureau, established by Ashikaga shoguns, who were influential art patrons. Shūbun's most well-known landscape painting, designated as a National Treasure in Japan, is Reading in a Bamboo Grove, now kept in the Tokyo National Museum.

[[File:Hyônen zu by Josetsu.jpg|thumb|170px|Hyōnen-zu (瓢鮎図), ink on paper, 111.5 × 75.8 cm, Myōshin-ji temple, Taizō-in, Kyoto.]]

Another style which developed in the Muromachi period is [[Shigajiku]] (詩画軸). This is usually a painting accompanied by poetry and has its roots in China, where painting and poetry were seen as inherently connected. This style grew out of literary circles, an artist would usually be given a subject to paint and the poets would write accompanying verses to be written above the work. A famous example is the scroll "Catching a Catfish with a Gourd" (Hyōnen-zu 瓢鮎図) located at [[Taizō-in]], [[Myōshin-ji]], Kyoto. Created by the priest-painter [[Josetsu]] ({{circa|1386}} – {{circa|1428}}), it includes 31 verses of many Zen priests inscribed above the painting. 
&lt;ref name="yuko-2"&gt;{{cite web |title = JAANUS Japanese architecture and art net users system |url =http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/shigajiku.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreground of the painting a man is depicted on the bank of a stream holding a small gourd and looking at a large slithery catfish. Mist fills the middle ground, and the background, mountains appear to be far in the distance. The painting was commissioned by the 4th Shogun of the Muromachi Period, Ashikaga Yoshimochi (1386-1428) and was based on the nonsensical riddle "How do you catch a catfish with a gourd?". An example of one of the Koans illustrates the style of the poetry inscribed above the painting.

&lt;poem&gt;:::Poised! With the Gourd
:::He tries to pin that slippery fish.
:::Some oil on the gourd
:::Would add zest to the chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Circa 1492: art in the age of exploration, 1991, Jay A. Levenson. P 321–22.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:::::::::::(Shusu [1423] Trans. Matsushita, 1974)&lt;/poem&gt;

The painting and accompanying poems capture both the playfulness and the perplexing nature of Zen buddhist ''[[kōans]]'' which was supposed to aid the Zen practitioner in his meditation and was a central practice of the [[Rinzai]] school.

In the late Muromachi period, ink painting had migrated out of the Zen monasteries into the art world in general, as artists from the Kano school and the Ami school adopted the style and themes, but introducing a more plastic and decorative effect that would continue into modern times.

This period saw the rise of the [[Kanō school]] (狩野派 Kanō-ha?) which is one of the most famous schools of Japanese painting. The Kanō school of painting was the dominant style of painting until the Meiji period. It was founded by Kanō Masanobu (1434–1530), a contemporary of Sesshū and student of Shūbun who became an official painter in the Shogun's court. The artists who followed him including his son improved upon his style and methods. His son, [[Kanō Motonobu]] (1476–1559) established the Kano style as the main Japanese painting school during the Muromachi period.

In sharp contrast to the previous Muromachi period, the Azuchi Momoyama period was characterized by a grandiose polychrome style, with extensive use of [[gold]] and [[silver]] foil, and by works on a very large scale. [[Kanō school]] painters were patronized by [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], and their followers. [[Kanō Eitoku]] developed a formula for the creation of monumental landscapes on the sliding doors enclosing a room. These huge screens and wall paintings were commissioned to decorate the castles and palaces of the military nobility. This status continued into the subsequent Edo period, as the [[Tokugawa bakufu]] continued to promote the works of the Kanō school as the officially sanctioned art for the ''[[shōgun]]'', ''[[daimyō]]s'', and [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial court]]. The rise of the Kanō school saw a beginning of a move away from buddhist themes, as Kano school patrons commissioned paintings of a more secular nature to decorate their palaces.

However some painters in this period continued to look back to the Buddhist priest-painters which had initially influenced the Kano school. One of these painters was [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], who was influenced by the monochrome ink paintings of the Muromachi painter [[Sesshū]] and developed his own style of [[Sumi-e]] which looked back to the minimalism of its predecessors. Tōhaku was in fact so much enamored with the techniques of [[Sesshū Tōyō]] that he attempted to claim rights as his fifth successor, though he lost in a court battle to [[Unkoku Togan]].&lt;ref name="HASEGAWA"&gt;[http://www.kyoto.zaq.ne.jp/mibu/eng/pages/artworks/paintings/tohaku.html HASEGAWA Tohaku (1539–1610)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208192923/http://www.kyoto.zaq.ne.jp/mibu/eng/pages/artworks/paintings/tohaku.html |date=2009-12-08 }} Mibura-Dera Temple Website. 10 Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the influence of Sesshū is evident in many of Tōhaku's mid to late works, such as his famous {{nihongo|''[[Shōrin-zu byōbu]]''|松林図 屏風|extra2=Pine Trees screen}}, which were declared a [[National Treasures of Japan|national treasure of Japan]] are argued to be the first paintings of their scale to depict only pine trees as subject matter.&lt;ref name="HASEGAWA"/&gt;

The school founded by Hasegawa Tōhaku is known today as the [[Hasegawa school]]. This school was small, consisting mostly of Tōhaku and his sons. However small, its members conserved Tōhaku's quiet and reserved aesthetic, which many attribute to the influence of [[Sesshū]] as well as his contemporary and friend, [[Sen no Rikyū]]. It is suspected that these simple aesthetics protest the usage of intimidation and wealth rampant in the [[Kanō school]].&lt;ref&gt;Moes, Robert D.. "The Other Side of Tōhaku".

===Zen art===
Under the Zen sect of Buddhism, which became very popular in Japan in the 14th and 15th centuries, portraits of Zen priests were often produced. Zen was a sect of Buddhism which promoted simplicity and less involved in worship, so religious paintings were not needed for this reason. Instead, Zen priests often painted images of teachers and Zen masters. Unlike in the earlier Heian period, where it had been considered "rude in Heian times to copy a person's likeness"{{attribution needed|date=January 2018}} (Stanley-Baker 2000, 115), the Zen portraits were close-up portraits showing facial features and details. A portrait of [[Zen Teacher/Zen Master|Zen master]] Muso Kokushi painted by his student Muto Shui, shows a detailed portrait of the face, with the whole picture being only a head and shoulders portrait. This is unlike earlier Japanese painting which would depict people as much smaller figures. Zen priests also painted landscapes, such as the [[Ink and wash painting|suiboku-ga]], or water and black ink painting, which was inspired by Zen doctrine.

==Architecture==
Buddhism exerted tremendous influence on [[Japanese art]] in a variety of ways and through many periods of Japanese history. [[Buddhist temples]] with their halls and five-story towers were built all over Japan, and huge sculptures of Buddha were made for these temples.

'''Campanology''' (from [[Late Latin]] ''[[wiktionary:campana|campana]]'', "bell"; and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the study of [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s. It encompasses the technology of bells – how they are [[casting (metalworking)|cast]], [[musical tuning|tuned]], rung, and sounded – as well as the history, methods, and traditions of bell-ringing as an art.&lt;ref&gt;From Glossary of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers 2016; "Campanology - Study of the history, art and science of making and ringing bells.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common to collect together a set of tuned bells and treat the whole as one [[musical instrument]]. Such collections – such as a Flemish carillon, a Russian ''zvon'', or an English "[[ring of bells]]" used for [[change ringing]] – have their own practices and challenges; and campanology is likewise the study of perfecting such instruments and  composing and performing music for them.

In this sense, however, the word ''campanology'' is most often used in reference to relatively large bells, often hung in a tower. It is not usually applied to assemblages of smaller bells, such as a [[glockenspiel]], a collection of [[tubular bell]]s, or an Indonesian [[gamelan]].

A campanologist is one who studies campanology, though it is popularly mis-used to refer to a [[bell ringer]].&lt;ref&gt;From Glossary of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers 2016; " Campanologist - One who studies campanology, (popularly mis-used to refer to a ringer).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carillons==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Carillon]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Carillon}}

[[File:Carillon of PeterAndPaulCathedral 1.JPG|thumb|Carillon - showing the large number of tuned bells normally used]]

The carillon is a collection of tuned bells for playing conventional melodic music. The bells are stationary and struck by hammers linked to a clavier keyboard.
[[File:JeffDaehn.jpg|thumb|Carillonneur in action]]
The instrument is played sitting on a bench by hitting the top keyboard that allows expression through variation of touch, with the underside of the half-clenched fists, and the bottom keyboard with the feet, since the lower notes in particular require more physical strength than an organ, the latter not attaining the tonal range of the better carillons: for some of these, their bell producing the lowest tone, the 'bourdon', may weigh well over 8 [[tonne]]s; other fine bells settle for 5 to 6 tonnes. A carillon renders at least two octaves for which it needs 23 bells, though the finest have 47 to 56 bells or extravagantly even more, arranged in [[chromatic]] sequence, so tuned as to produce concordant harmony when many bells are sounded together.

Professional Carillonneurs like Belgian [[Jef Denyn]] have widespread fame&lt;ref name="Discography of Jef Denyn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jef Denyn Discography at Discogs|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jef+Denyn|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest are found in church towers in continental northern Europe, especially in cathedral towers in Belgium and present-day northern France, where some (like the [[St. Rumbolds Cathedral]] in [[Mechelen]], the [[Cathedral of Our Lady]] in [[Antwerp]]) became [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] &amp;ndash; classified with the Belfry of Bruges and its municipal Carillon under '[[Belfries of Belgium and France]]'.&lt;br&gt;The carillon of [[Kirk in the Hills]], [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]], [[United States]], along with the one at Hyechon College in [[Daejeon|Daejoen, South Korea]], have the highest number of bells in the world: 77.&lt;br&gt;Modern large carillon edifices have been erected as stand-alone instruments across the world, for instance the [[Netherlands Carillon]] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].
The carillon in the Church of St Peter, [[Aberdyfi]], Gwynedd, Wales is often used to play the famous '[[The Bells of Aberdovey (song)|Bells of Aberdovey]]' tune.

==Chimes==
{{Main article|Chime (bell instrument)}}
A carillon-like instrument with fewer than 23 bells is called a ''chime''. American chimes usually have one to one and a half [[diatonic]] octaves. Many chimes play an automated piece of music, such as [[clock chimes]]. Chime bells generally used to lack dynamic variation and [[inner tuning]], or the mathematical balance of a bell's complex sound, to permit use of harmony. Since the 20th century, in Belgium and The Netherlands, clock chime bells have inner tuning and produce complex fully harmonized music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martinmdb.com/bells.html Bell Facts &amp;ndash; Bell Chimes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813004017/http://www.martinmdb.com/bells.html |date=2006-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These chimes should not be confused with another musical instrument also called ''chimes'' (or ''[[tubular bell]]s'') nor with a ''[[wind chime]]''.

==Russian Orthodox bells==
{{Main article|Russian Orthodox bell ringing}}
[[File:Bell-ringer yaroslavl 2012.ogv|thumb|Bell-ringer demonstrating Russian chiming on a portable belfry]]
The bells in Russian tradition are sounded by their clappers, attached to ropes; a special system of ropes is developed individually for every belltower. All the ropes are gathered in one place, where the bell-ringer stands. The ropes (usually all ropes) are not pulled, but rather pressed with hands or legs. Since one end of every rope is fixed, and the ropes are kept in tension, a press or even a punch on a rope makes a clapper move.

The Russian [[Tsar Bell]] is the largest extant bell in the world.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Full circle change ringing==
{{Main article|Change ringing}}
[[File:Bells.devon.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|Change ringing in a church in [[Devon]], England]]
[[File:St Bees bells in up position.jpg|thumb|The bells of [[St Bees Priory]], England shown in the "up" position. When being rung they swing through a full circle from mouth upwards round to mouth upwards, and then back again.]]

In English style (see below) [[full circle ringing]] the bells in a church tower are hung so that on each stroke the bell swings through a complete circle; actually a little more than 360 degrees. Between strokes, it briefly sits poised 'upside-down', with the mouth pointed upwards; pulling on a rope connected to a large diameter wheel attached to the bell swings it down and the assembly's own momentum propels the bell back up again on the other side of the swing. Each alternate pull or stroke is identified as either ''handstroke'' or ''backstroke'' - handstroke where the "sally" (the fluffy area covered with wool) is pulled followed by a pull on the plain "tail". At [[East Bergholt]] in the English county of [[Suffolk]], there is a unique set of bells that are not in a tower and are rung full circle by hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = East Bergholt and Constable Country: The Bell Cage | url = http://www.eastbergholt-bells.org.uk/ | access-date = 27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the heaviest ring of five bells listed in [[Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers | publisher = Central Council of Church Bell Ringers | url = http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/home.php | access-date = 27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a tenor of {{long ton||26|0|8}} and a combined weight of {{long ton|4|5|2|24}}

These [[ring of bells|rings of bells]] have relatively few bells, compared with a carillon; six or eight-bell towers are common, with the largest rings in numbering up to sixteen bells. The bells are usually tuned to fall in a [[diatonic scale]] without [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] notes; they are traditionally numbered from the top downwards so that the highest bell (called the ''treble'') is numbered 1 and the lowest bell (the ''tenor'') has the highest number; it is usually the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] note of the bells' scale.

To swing the heavy bells requires a ringer for each bell. Furthermore, the great [[inertia]]s involved mean that a ringer has only a limited ability to retard or accelerate his/her bell's cycle. Along with the relatively limited palette of notes available, the upshot is that such rings of bells do not easily lend themselves to ringing [[melody|melodies]].

[[File:Plain-bob-minor 2.png|180px|right|thumb|This is a diagram of one type of method ringing. Each bell strikes once in every sequence, or change, and repetition is avoided. Here 1 is the highest-pitched, and 6 is the lowest]] 
Instead, a system of ''change ringing'' evolved, probably early in the seventeenth century, which centres on [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[permutations]]. The ringers begin with ''rounds'', which is simply ringing down the scale in numerical order. (On six bells this would be ''123456''.) The ringing then proceeds in a series of ''rows'' or ''changes'', each of which is some permutation of rounds  (for example ''214365'') where no bell changes by more than one position from the preceding row (this is also known as the [[Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm]]).

In ''call change ringing'', one of the ringers (known as the ''Conductor'') calls out to tell the other ringers how to vary their order. The timing of the calls and changes of pattern accompanying them are made at the discretion of the Conductor and so do not necessarily involve a change of ringing sequence at each successive stroke as is characteristic of ''method ringing''. Some ringers, notably in the West of England where there is a strong call-change tradition, ring call changes exclusively but for others, the essence of change ringing is the substantially different method ringing. As of 2015 there are 7,140 English style rings.  The Netherlands, Pakistan, India, and Spain have one each.  The Windward Isles and the Isle of Man have 2 each.  Canada and New Zealand 8 each.  The Channel Isles 10.  Africa as a continent has 13.  Scotland 24, Ireland 37, USA 48, Australia 59 and Wales 227.  The remaining 6,798 (95.2%) are in England (including three mobile rings).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = County Lists from Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers | publisher = Central Council of Church Bell Ringers | url = http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/home.php | accessdate = 12 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Method ringing===
{{Main article|Method ringing}}

In ''method'' or ''scientific ringing'' each ringer has memorized a pattern describing his or her bell's course from row to row; taken together, these patterns (along with only occasional ''calls'' made by a conductor) form an [[algorithm]] which cycles through the various available permutations dictated by the number of bells available. There are hundreds of these methods which have been composed over the centuries and all have names, some being very fanciful. Better-known examples such as Plain Bob, Reverse Canterbury, Grandsire and Double Oxford are familiar to most ringers.

Serious ringing always starts and ends with rounds; and it must always be ''true'' — each row must be unique, never repeated. A performance of a few hundred rows or so is called a ''touch''.  A performance of all the possible permutations possible on a set of bells is called an ''extent'', with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; bells there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;[[factorial|!]] possible permutations.  With five bells 5! = 120 which takes about 5 minutes.  With seven bells 7! = 5,040 which takes about three hours to ring.  This is the definition of a full peal on 7 (5,000 or more for other numbers of bells.)  Less demanding is the quarter peal of 1,260 changes.  When ringing peals and quarter peals on fewer bells several complete extents are rung consecutively.  When ringing on higher numbers of bells less than a complete extent is rung.  On eight bells the extent is 8!=40,320 which has only been accomplished once, taking nearly nineteen hours.

Ringing in English belltowers became a popular hobby in the late 17th century, in the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era; the scientific approach which led to modern method ringing can be traced to two books of that era, ''Tintinnalogia or the Art of Ringing'' (published in 1668 by Richard Duckworth and [[Fabian Stedman]]) and ''Campanalogia'' (also by Stedman; first released 1677; see [[Campanology#Bibliography|Bibliography]]). Today change ringing remains most popular in England but is practiced worldwide; over four thousand peals are rung each year.

[[Dorothy L. Sayers]]'s mystery story, ''[[The Nine Tailors]]'' (1934) centres around change ringing of bells in a [[The Fens|Fenland]] church; her father was a clergyman.

==Ellacombe apparatus==
{{Main article|Ellacombe apparatus}}
[[File:Ellacombe apparatus for 6 bells.jpg|right|thumb|Ellacombe apparatus for 6 bells]]
The '''Ellacombe apparatus''' is an English mechanism devised for chiming by striking stationary bells with external hammers. However it does not have the same sound as [[full circle ringing]] due to the absence of the doppler effect derived from bell rotation and the lack of a damping effect of the clapper after each strike.

It requires only one person to operate. Each hammer is connected by a rope to a fixed frame in the bell-ringing room. When in use the ropes are taut, and pulling one of the ropes towards the player will strike the hammer against the bell. To enable normal full circle ringing on the same bells, the ropes are slackened to allow the hammers to drop away from the moving bells.

The system was devised by Reverend [[Henry Thomas Ellacombe]] of Gloucestershire, who first had such a system installed in [[Bitton]] in 1821. He created the system to make conventional bell-ringers redundant, so churches did not have to tolerate the behaviour of what he thought were unruly bell-ringers.

However, in reality, it required very rare expertise for one person to ring changes. The sound of a chime was a poor substitute for the rich sound of swinging bells, and the apparatus fell out of fashion. Consequently, the Ellacombe apparatus has been disconnected or removed from many towers in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. In towers where the apparatus remains intact, it is generally used like a [[Carillon]], but to play  simple tunes, or if expertise exists, to play changes.

==Gamelan==
{{Main article|Gamelan}}
Perhaps the best-known example from outside Europe of an organized system of bells is the [[gamelan]], an [[Indonesia]]n orchestra-like ensemble in which a prominent part is played by a variety of tuned bells, gongs, and metallophones.

(1992). Harvey Jonathan. "Moruos Plango, Vivos Voco: A Realization at IRCAM", ''The Music Machine'', p.92. {{ISBN|978-0-262-68078-3}}. Harvey added, "a clearly audible, slow-decaying partial at 347 Hz with a beating component in it. It is a resultant of the various F harmonic series partials that can be clearly seen in the spectrum (5, [6], 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, etc.) beside the C-related partials."&lt;/ref&gt; "The bell produces a secondary pitch (f') which lies outside that 'inharmonic series though it is clearly audible when the bell is struck, 'to curiously thrilling and disturbing effect.'"&lt;ref&gt;Downes, Michael (2009). ''Jonathan Harvey: Song offerings and White as jasmine'', p.22. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-6022-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Jonathan Harvey - Winchester Cathedral bell spectrum.mid|Play approximation}} The strike tone is [[middle C]], the hum tone an octave below.]]

The tuning of a bell is completely dependent on its shape. When first cast it is approximately correct, but it is then machined on a tuning lathe to remove metal until it is in tune. This is a very complex exercise which took centuries of empirical practice, and latterly modern acoustic science, to understand.

If a bell is part of a set to be rung or played together, then the initial dominant perceived sound, called the strike note, must be tuned to a designated note of a common scale. In addition each bell will emit harmonics, or partials, which must also be tuned so that these are not discordant with the bell's strike note. This is what Fuller-Maitland writing in ''Grove's dictionary of music and musicians'' meant when he said : "Good tone means that a bell must be in tune with itself."&lt;ref name="Groves"/&gt;

The principal partials are;
* hum note -an octave below the strike note,  
* strike note
* tierce - minor third above the strike note 
* quint - perfect fifth above the strike note
* nominal - octave above the strike note

Further, less dominant, partials include the major, third and perfect fifth in the octave above these.

"Whether a founder tunes the nominal or the strike note makes little difference, however, because the nominal is one of the main partials that determines the tuning of the strike note."&lt;ref name="Physics"&gt;Neville Horner Fletcher, Thomas D. Rossing (1998). ''The Physics of Musical Instruments'', p.685. {{ISBN|978-0-387-98374-5}}. Cites Schoofs et al., 1987 for major-third bell.&lt;/ref&gt; A heavy clapper brings out lower partials (clappers often being about 3% of a bell's mass), while a higher clapper velocity strengthens higher partials (0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s being moderate).  The relative depth of the "bowl" or "cup" part of the bell also determines the number and strength of the partials in order to achieve a desired timbre.

Bells are generally around 80% copper and 20% tin ([[bell metal]]), with the tone varying according to material.

Tone and pitch is also affected by the method in which a bell is struck. Asian large bells are often bowl shaped but lack the lip and are often not free-swinging. Also note the special shape of [[Bianzhong]] bells, allowing two tones. The scaling or size of most bells to each other may be approximated by the equation for circular cylinders:

''f=Ch/D&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'',

where ''h'' is thickness, ''D'' is diameter, and ''C'' is a constant determined by the material and the profile.&lt;ref name="Rossing139"&gt;Rossing, Thomas D. (2000). ''Science of Percussion Instruments'', p.139. {{ISBN|978-981-02-4158-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The major third bell===
On the theory that pieces in major keys may better be accommodated, after many unsatisfactory attempts, in the 1980s, using computer modeling for assistance in design by scientists at the Technical University in Eindhoven, bells with a major-third profile were created by the Eijsbouts Bellfoundry in the Netherlands,&lt;ref name="Physics"/&gt; being described as resembling old Coke bottles&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.yale.edu/~douglas-craig/bells/Basic/what-is-a-carillon.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in that they have a bulge around the middle;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.andrelehr.nl/woboek/f_56.htm Major third bell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018230102/http://www.andrelehr.nl/woboek/f_56.htm |date=2007-10-18 }}", ''Andrelehr.nl''.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999 a design without the bulge was announced.&lt;ref name="Rossing139"/&gt;

{{about|the computer architecture|the biological concept|Structural biology}}

A '''cellular architecture''' is a type of [[computer architecture]] prominent in [[parallel computing]]. Cellular architectures are relatively new, with [[IBM]]'s [[Cell microprocessor]] being the first one to reach the market. Cellular architecture takes [[Multi-core (computing)|multi-core architecture]] design to its logical conclusion, by giving the programmer the ability to run large numbers of concurrent threads within a single processor. Each 'cell' is a compute node containing thread units, memory, and communication. Speed-up is achieved by exploiting [[thread-level parallelism]] inherent in many applications.

Cell, a cellular architecture containing 9 cores, is the processor used in the [[PlayStation 3]]. Another prominent cellular architecture is [[Cyclops64]], a massively parallel architecture currently under development by IBM.  

Cellular architectures follow the [[low-level programming]] paradigm, which exposes the programmer to much of the underlying hardware. This allows the programmer to greatly optimize their code for the platform, but at the same time makes it more difficult to [[software development|develop software]].

'''''Colleges That Change Lives'''''  is a [[undergraduate education|college]] educational guide, originally by longtime student advocate and former ''[[New York Times]]'' education editor [[Loren Pope]].&lt;ref name="Wash Post obit" /&gt; It was first published in 1996, with a second edition in 2000, a third edition in 2006 and a fourth edition in 2013. It concerns [[college admissions in the United States]].

The third edition profiles 40 choices for [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] that, according to Pope, offer as much, if not more, than [[Ivy League]] schools: "The phrase 'Ivy League education' is an [[wikt:oxymoron|oxymoron]] when compared to the benefactions to mind and soul the colleges in this book bestow.  Not only are they better, but they want you, and you will love them for making a new and better you. Your satisfaction will be lifelong."&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Loren. ''Colleges That Change Lives'', 3rd edition, 2006, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colleges That Change Lives, Inc.==
Following Loren Pope's message, '''Colleges That Change Lives, Inc.''' (CTCL) was founded in 2006 as a non-profit, [[501(c)(3)]] organization dedicated to the advancement and support of a student-centered college search process. The organization supports the goal of each student finding a college that develops a lifelong love of learning and provides the foundation for a successful and fulfilling life beyond college. According to the CTCL website: 
{{quote|In following Mr. Pope’s ideals, we believe that the criteria most college-bound students and their parents and counselors use, such as name and prestige, do not acknowledge the importance of understanding an individual student’s needs and how they 'fit' with the mission and identity of an individual college community.}} 
The organization's work is inspired by Loren Pope, who died in 2008.&lt;ref name="Wash Post obit"&gt;Hutchinson, Carol. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/26/AR2008092603547.html "College Consultant Loren Pope; Commissioned a Wright House"], ''The Washington Post'', 27 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Colleges That Change Lives, Inc. operates independently from both the Pope estate and Penguin Books and receives no financial remuneration from either source.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

CTCL hosts programs during four annual tours in 26 cities in the United States and abroad. Each programs offers a 30-minute presentation about how to choose a college for fit, not rank, and then provides attendees the opportunity to speak with representatives from the 40 colleges featured in the book. The programs are free of charge and open to the public.  In addition, [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]], [[Bard College]], and [[Grinnell College]] were formerly institutions rated by Loren Pope as Colleges That Change Lives, but were removed in later editions because the institutions became too selective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/28/education/28face.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0&amp;ref=teachersandschoolemployees|title = A Fighter for Colleges That Have Everything but Status|last = Finder|first = Alan|date = February 28, 2007|work = |access-date = May 10, 2015|via = |newspaper = The New York Times|department = Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Andrews University (North Carolina)|St. Andrews University]] (formerly St. Andrews Presbyterian College) was included in the revised edition, but removed in later editions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="797">'''Constrained-layer damping''' is a mechanical engineering technique for suppression of vibration.  Typically a [[viscoelastic]] or other [[damping]] material, is sandwiched between two sheets of [[stiffness |stiff]] materials that lack sufficient damping by themselves. The ending result is, any vibration made on either side of the constraining materials (the two stiffer materials on the sides) are trapped and evidently dissipated in the [[viscoelastic]] or middle layer.

'''Cytoarchitecture''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wiktionary:κύτος#Ancient_Greek|κύτος]]''= "cell" + ''[[wiktionary:ἀρχιτέκτων#Ancient_Greek|ἀρχιτεκτονική]]''= "architecture"), also known as '''cytoarchitectonics''', is the study of the [[cell (biology)|cell]]ular composition of the central nervous system's tissues under the microscope. Cytoarchitectonics is one of the ways to parse the brain, by obtaining sections of the brain using a microtome and staining them with chemical agents which reveal where different [[neuron]]s are located.

The study of the parcellation of ''nerve fibers'' (primarily [[axon]]s) into layers forms the subject of '''myeloarchitectonics''' (&lt;Gk. ''μυελός''=marrow + ''ἀρχιτεκτονική''=architecture), an approach complementary to cytoarchitectonics.&lt;ref name="ByrnesWasik2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James P. Byrnes|author2=Barbara A. Wasik|title=Language and Literacy Development: What Educators Need to Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_EZkyh6a4IC&amp;pg=PT38|date=23 March 2012|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-4625-0666-8|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the cerebral cytoarchitecture ==
Defining cerebral cytoarchitecture began with the advent of [[histology]]—the science of slicing and staining brain slices for examination.&lt;ref name="Petrides2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Petrides|title=Neuroanatomy of Language Regions of the Human Brain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYlqAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90|date=3 December 2013|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-405931-3|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is credited to the Viennese psychiatrist [[Theodor Meynert]] (1833–1892), who in 1867 noticed regional variations in the histological structure of different parts of the gray matter in the cerebral hemispheres.&lt;ref&gt;Meynert, T. (1872) ''Der Bau der Gross-Hirnrinde und seine örtlichen Verschiedenheiten, nebst einem pathologisch–anatomischen Corollarium''. J.H. Heuser’sche Verlagsbuchhandlung, Neuwied &amp; Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Flechsig]] was the first to present the cytoarchitecture of human brain into 40 areas.&lt;ref&gt;Neue Untersuchungen über die Markbildung in den menschlichen Grosshirnlappen. Neurologisches Centralblatt 17, 977-996 (1898)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Walter Campbell]], then, present the cytoarchitecture of the human brain into 14 areas.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, A.W. (1903) Histological studies on cerebral localisation. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London 72:'' 488-492.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] (1871–1937), a New South Wales native working in Cairo, identified 50 areas.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot Smith, G. (1907) A new topographical survey of the human cerebral cortex, being an account of the distribution of the anatomically distinct cortical areas and their relationship to the cerebral sulci. ''Journal of Anatomy and Physiology (London) 41:'' 237-254.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korbinian Brodmann]] worked on the brains of diverse mammalian species and developed a division of the cerebral cortex into 52 discrete areas (of which 44 in the human, and the remaining 8 in non-human primate brain).&lt;ref&gt;Brodmann, K. (1909) ''Vergleichende Lokalisationslehre der Grosshirnrinde in ihren Prinzipien dargestellt auf Grund des Zellenbaues''. Johann Ambrosius Barth, Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garey, L.J. (2006) ''Brodmann’s Localisation in the Cerebral Cortex''. Springer Science, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Brodmann used numbers to categorize the different architectural areas&lt;ref name="Petrides2013" /&gt; and he believed that each of these regions served a unique functional purpose.&lt;ref name="UniversityUniversity2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yosef Grodzinsky Professor and Canadian Research Chair in Neurolinguistics McGill University|author2=Katrin Amunts Professor of Structural-Functional Brain Mapping Aachen University|title=Broca's Region|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=onsnTke-STgC&amp;pg=PA18|date=24 March 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-803952-5|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Constantin von Economo]] and [[Georg N. Koskinas]], two neurologists in Vienna, produced a landmark work in brain research by defining 107 cortical areas on the basis of cytoarchitectonic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Economo, C. von, Koskinas, G.N. (1925) ''Die Cytoarchitektonik der Hirnrinde des erwachsenen Menschen''. Julius Springer, Vienna.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Economo, C. von, Koskinas, G.N. (2008) ''Atlas of Cytoarchitectonics of the Adult Human Cerebral Cortex'' (translated, revised and edited by L.C. Triarhou). Karger, Basel.&lt;/ref&gt; They used letters to categorize the architecture, e.g., "F" for areas of the [[frontal lobe]].

== The Nissl staining technique ==
The Nissl staining technique (named for [[Franz Nissl]] the neuroscientist and histologist who originated the technique) is commonly used for determining the cytoarchitectonics of neuroanatomical structures, using common agents such as [[thionin]], [[cresyl violet]], or [[neutral red]]. These dyes intensely stain "[[Nissl bodies]]" ([[rough endoplasmic reticulum]]), which are abundant in neurons and reveal specific patterns of cytoarchitecture in the brain. Other common staining techniques used by histologists in other tissues (such as the hematoxylin and eosin or "[[H&amp;E stain]]") leave brain tissue appearing largely homogeneous and do not reveal the level of organization apparent in a Nissl stain. Nissl staining reveals details ranging from the macroscopic, such as the laminar pattern of the cerebral cortex or the interlocking nuclear patterns of the diencephalon and brainstem, to the microscopic, such as the distinctions between individual neurons and [[glia]] in any subregion of the central nervous system. Many other neuroanatomic and cytoarchitectonic techniques are available to supplement Nissl cytoarchitectonics, including [[immunohistochemistry]] and [[in situ hybridization]], which allow one to label any [[gene]] or [[protein]] expressed in any group of cells in the brain. However, Nissl cytoarchitecture remains a reliable, inexpensive, and familiar starting or reference point for neuroscientists wishing to examine or communicate their findings in a widely recognized anatomical framework and/or in reference to neuroanatomical atlases which use the same technique.

The '''date of birth of [[Jesus]] ''' is not stated in the [[gospels]] or in any secular text but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC.&lt;ref name=JDG324 &gt;{{Cite journal | first = James DG | last = Dunn | title = Jesus Remembered | publisher = Eerdmans Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical evidence is too incomplete to allow a definitive dating,&lt;ref&gt;Doggett. (2000). [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/calendars.html "Calendars"] (Ch. 12), in P. Kenneth Seidelmann (Ed.) ''Explanatory supplement to the astronomical almanac.'' Sausalito, CA: University Science Books. {{ISBN|0-935702-68-7}}. p579: "Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before AD 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating".&lt;/ref&gt; but the date is estimated through two different approaches—one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] accounts in the [[Gospel of Luke|Gospels of Luke]] and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the [[ministry of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul &gt;[[Paul L. Maier]] "The Date of the Nativity and Chronology of Jesus" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos: nativity and chronological studies'' by Jerry Vardaman, Edwin M. Yamauchi 1989 {{ISBN|0-931464-50-1}} pp. 113–129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Niswonger121 &gt;''New Testament History'' by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 {{ISBN|0-310-31201-9}} pp. 121–124&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimation via the Nativity accounts==
The [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] accounts in the [[New Testament]] gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] do not mention a date or time of year for the birth of Jesus, and [[Karl Rahner]] states that the gospels do not, in general, provide enough details of dates to satisfy the demands of modern historians.&lt;ref name=Rahner732 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum Mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} p. 731&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream scholars do not see the Luke and Matthew nativity stories as historically factual,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Borg]], "The Meaning of the Birth Stories" in Marcus Borg, N T Wright, ''The Meaning of Jesus: Two Visions'' (Harper One, 1999) page 179: "I (and most mainline scholars) do not see these stories as historically factual."&lt;/ref&gt; and for this reason, they do not consider them a reliable method for determining Jesus' date of birth.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, E. P. ''The historical figure of Jesus''. Penguin, 1993, pages 85–88&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Rahner]] states that the authors of the gospels generally focused on theological elements rather than historical chronologies.&lt;ref name=Rahner731 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum Mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} page 731&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Luke and Matthew associate Jesus' birth with the time of [[Herod the Great]].&lt;ref name="Rahner731"/&gt; [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#2:1|Matthew 2:1]] states that "Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king". He also implies that Jesus could have been as much as two years old at the time of the visit of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]], because Herod ordered the murder of all boys up to the age of two years, "in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi".

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#1:5|Luke 1:5]] mentions the reign of Herod shortly before the birth of Jesus,&lt;ref name=Niswonger121 /&gt; but places the birth during the [[Census of Quirinius]], which only took place ten years later in AD 6 as described by the Jewish historian [[Josephus]].&lt;ref name=Rahner731 /&gt; He, in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (c. AD 93), indicates that Cyrenius/Quirinius' governorship of Syria began in AD 6, and Josephus mentions a census sometime between AD 6–7.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E5dCAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=josephus+antiquities+of+the+jews&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Antiquities of the Jews'', Book 18, Chapters 1–2]. Josephus indicates that the census under Cyrenius (i.e., Quirinius) occurred in the 37th year after Octavian's (i.e., Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus') victory over Marc Antony at Actium, which secular historical records date to 2 September 31 BC. Therefore 31 BC + 37 years = AD 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars believe Luke made an error in referring to the census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Archer | first=Gleason Leonard | authorlink=Gleason Leonard Archer | title=Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties |date=April 1982  | publisher=Zondervan Pub.

As far as the month of Jesus' birth, it can be inferred to be summer or fall. Combining inferences from when shepherds would likely be in the fields and working backward from Zechariah's priestly service (John the Baptist's father) and its connections to Jesus' birth, one arrives at a likely date of mid-September to early October. This would suggest the conception of Jesus might have been in December, but not his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/when-was-jesus-born|title=When was Jesus born? {{!}} Bibleinfo.com|website=www.bibleinfo.com|language=en|access-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://christinprophecy.org/articles/when-was-jesus-born/|title=When Was Jesus Born?|work=Lamb and Lion Ministries|access-date=1 December 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working backwards from when Jesus began preaching==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Pharisees Question Jesus (Les pharisiens questionnent Jésus) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|left|Dispute of Jesus and the Pharisees, by [[James Tissot]], c. 1890]]
Another approach to estimating the year of birth works backwards from when Jesus began preaching, based on the statement in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:23]] that he was "about 30 years of age" at that time.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by [[Andreas J. Köstenberger]], L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} page 114&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus began to preach after being baptised by [[John the Baptist]], and based on Luke’s gospel John only began baptising people in "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar" ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1–2]]), which scholars estimate would be in about AD 28–29.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' 2000 Amsterdam University Press {{ISBN|90-5356-503-5}} page 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1'' by Craig A. Evans 2003 {{ISBN|0-7814-3868-3}} pages 67–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoehner 1978 29–37"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chronological Aspects of the Life of Christ | last = Hoehner| first = Harold W | authorlink = Harold Hoehner|year= 1978|publisher=Zondervan |isbn= 0-310-26211-9|pages= 29–37| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6z-NcR7fVSIC&amp;dq=CHronological+Aspects+of+the+Life+of+Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt; By working backwards from this, it would appear that Jesus was probably born no later than 1 BC. However, if the phrase "about 30" is interpreted to mean 32 years old, this could fit a date of birth just within the reign of Herod, who died in 4 BC.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 &gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pages 302–303&lt;/ref&gt;

This date is independently confirmed by John's reference in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:20|John 2:20]] to the Temple being in its 46th year of construction during Passover when Jesus began his ministry, which corresponds to around 27–29 AD according to scholarly estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Jack V. Scarola, "A Chronology of the nativity Era" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos 2'' by Ray Summers, Jerry Vardaman 1998 {{ISBN|0-86554-582-0}} pages 61–81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christmas celebration==
Despite the celebration of Christmas in December, neither Luke nor Matthew mentions a season for when Jesus was born. However, scholarly arguments regarding the realism of shepherds grazing their flock during the winter have taken place, both challenging a winter birth for Jesus as well as defending it by relying on the mildness of winters in ancient Israel and [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic]] rules regarding sheep near Bethlehem before February.&lt;ref&gt;"New Testament History" by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 {{ISBN|0-310-31201-9}} pp. 121–124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Luke: an introduction and commentary'' by Leon Morris 1988 {{ISBN|0-8028-0419-5}} p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of Jesus' Birth'' by Edwin D. Freed 2004 {{ISBN|0-567-08046-3}} pp. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Murray of ''History Today'' says that the celebration of [[Christmas]] as the birth day of Jesus is based on a date of a pagan feast rather than historical analysis.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Murray, Alexander, [http://www.historytoday.com/alexander-murray/medieval-christmas "Medieval Christmas"], ''History Today'', December 1986, '''36''' (12), pp. 31–39.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saturnalia]], the Roman feast for Saturn, was associated with the [[winter solstice]]. Saturnalia was held on 17 December of the Julian calendar and later expanded with festivities through to 23 December. The holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn, in the Roman Forum, and a public banquet, followed by private gift-giving, continual partying, and a carnival atmosphere that overturned Roman social norms. It is likely that such a Christian feast was chosen for Christ's marked contrast and triumph over paganism; indeed, new converts who attempted to introduce pagan elements into the Christian celebrations were sharply rebuked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=7399|title=Library : History &amp; Origin: Feast of the Nativity|website=www.catholicculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

December 25 may have been selected due to its proximity to the winter solstice, because of its theological significance. After the solstice, the days begin to lengthen with more sunlight, which Christians see as representing the [[Light of Christ]] entering the world. This mirrors the celebration of the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]] on June 24, near the [[summer solstice]]; John said of Jesus "He must increase, I must decrease." {{bibleref2|John 3:30|NRSV}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholic.com/qa/why-do-we-celebrate-jesus-birth-on-december-25|title=Why do we celebrate Jesus' birth on December 25? - Catholic Answers|website=www.catholic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1st and 2nd centuries, the [[Lord's Day]] (Sunday) was the earliest Christian celebration and included a number of theological themes. In the 2nd century, the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] became a separate feast as [[Easter]] and in the same century [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] began to be celebrated in the Churches of the East on 6 January.&lt;ref&gt;''An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies'' by Orlando O. Espín, James B. Nickoloff 2007 {{ISBN|0-8146-5856-3}} page 237&lt;/ref&gt; The festival of the Nativity which later turned into Christmas was a 4th-century feast in the [[Western Church]] notably in Rome and North Africa, although it is uncertain exactly where and when it was first celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian worship in Reformed Churches past and present'' by Lukas Vischer 2002 {{ISBN|0-8028-0520-5}} pages 400–401&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest source stating 25 December as the date of birth of Jesus is likely by [[Hippolytus of Rome]], written very early in the 3rd century, based on the assumption that the conception of Jesus took place at the [[Spring equinox]] which he placed on 25 March, and then added nine months – festivals on that date were then celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;''Mercer Dictionary'' of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Edgar V. McKnight and Roger A. Bullard 2001 {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} page 142&lt;/ref&gt; 25 March would also roughly be the date of his crucifixion, which ancient Christians would have seen as confirming the date of his birth, since there was a notion that the great prophets were conceived into the afterlife on the same date they were conceived into the world.  [[John Chrysostom]] also argued for a 25 December date in the late 4th century, basing his argument on the assumption that the offering of incense in Luke 1:8–11 was the offering of incense by a high priest on [[Yom Kippur]] (early October), and, as above, counting fifteen months forward. However, this was very likely a retrospective justification of a choice already made rather than a genuine attempt to derive the correct birth date.&lt;ref&gt;Roger T. Beckwith (2001). Calendar and chronology, Jewish and Christian: biblical, intertestamental and patristic studies, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, 25 December might be a reference to the date of the Feast of the Dedication, which occurs on the 25 Kislev of the Jewish calendar.  This would require that early Christians simply translated Kislev directly to December.

==In Islam==
In Islam, the Quran references a fruit branch which Mary shook as she gave birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=3YhpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Quran+Jesus+19&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ4_H4_4_YAhWMNY8KHd1OAG8Q6AEIWzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20Jesus%2019&amp;f=false|title=Women in the Qur'an, Traditions, and Interpretation|last=Stowasser|first=Barbara Freyer|date=22 August 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199761838|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fruit, the date, is known to ripen during the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dateland.com/how-are-dates-grown/|title=How are Dates Grown?

Prof. '''Davor Džalto''' (Давор Џалто: born May 17, 1980) is an [[artist]], [[art historian]], [[theologian]] and [[philosopher]] of [[Liberalism|liberal]] orientation born in [[Travnik]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He is also known as one of the most important [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] [[Christian]] thinkers in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.svspress.com/the-human-work-of-art-a-theological-appraisal-of-creativity-and-the-death-of-the-artist/)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Davor-dzalto.jpg|thumb|Davor Džalto]]

He graduated from the School of Art in [[Niš]]. His academic career started in [[Belgrade]] where he received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] from the [[University of Belgrade]] [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]] in the [[history of art]]. In 2004 he began writing his PhD thesis at the [[Albert-Ludwigs Universitaet]] in Freiburg, Germany (mentor Professor Dr. Angeli Janhsen), where he defended it successfully in 2006, becoming the youngest doctor of philosophy in the humanities in Germany and the South-East European region.&lt;ref&gt;(Ksenija Pavlovic, ''10/30 Exhibition Catalogue'', Belgrade: 2010, 5–6)&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007 he has been a [[university professor]] of history and theory of art and of Orthodox Christian theology and [[religious studies]]. As a visiting and honorary professor he has taught at various universities in Europe and the US, including [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], [[Indiana University]], [[Fordham University]] of New York and [[The American University of Rome]]. He is also the [[president]] of The [[Institute]] for the Study of [[Culture]] and [[Christianity]].

His work is based on examination of the relations between [[personhood]] and [[authorship]], especially in the [[postmodern]] and [[globalization]] context. He has formulated a theory according to which art represents an [[Symbolic expression|expression]] of the [[personal identity]] of the human being, having an [[Existentialism|existential]] importance. That way he contributed to the revision of the [[postmodernism]], actualizing the question of possibility and meaning of the art creation. He continued to further develop theological concepts of [[John Zizioulas]] and philosophical statements given by [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], implementing them on the contemporary historical and cultural context. He also examines the concept of "[[simulacrum]]" in relation to the human person and its ability to create.

He also works in various media artistically including [[video art]], performance, painting, and sculpture.

His work has been presented at numerous exhibitions internationally. He has taken part in many conferences and seminars, having [[peace]] and inter-religious backgrounds. It is also held that he played an important role in [[South Eastern Europe]] in promoting peace, reconciliation and cooperation between religious communities, primarily because he has contacts among all important religions and religious leaders in the [[Balkans]] and in Europe. He was directly involved in many initiatives during his engagement in the [[Pax Christi]] office in Belgrade. He has written a number of articles and theoretical texts. As an 18-year-old student he published his first book, ''On Writings as an Artistic, Historical, Social and Cultural Phenomenon''. He is a founding member and the art director of the [[Flexible Art Network]] and vice president of the Christian Cultural Center. He lives and works in [[Freiburg]], [[Münster]] and [[Belgrade]]. Based on the ''Aesthetik der Absenz'', formulated in German-speaking art circles, he recognized and explained the phenomenon of "absence of body" in twentieth-century art. In 2007 his name was added to the list of 100 most influential people in the world, originating from the South Eastern European region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5633">'''Earth bulge''' is a term used in [[telecommunication]]s, meaning the curvature of the Earth's surface, which limits the range of communication methods that require a [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] path, like high frequency [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]]s, or [[laser]]s.

== Distance to horizon ==
[[File:Earthbulge.jpg|frame|'''R''' is the radius of the Earth, '''h''' is the height of the transmitter (exaggerated), '''d''' is the line of sight distance]]
Assuming the Earth is a perfect sphere with no terrain irregularity, the [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] distance to the horizon from a [[Transmitter station|transmitter]] located at a given altitude above the surface can readily be calculated.  Let '''R''' be the radius of Earth and '''h''' be the altitude of the transmitter's antenna. Line of sight distance '''d''' of this station is given  by the [[Pythagorean theorem]];

: &lt;math&gt;d^2=(R+h)^{2}-R^2= 2\cdot R \cdot h +h^2&lt;/math&gt;

Since the altitude of the station is much less than the radius of the Earth, 

: &lt;math&gt;d \approx \sqrt{ 2\cdot R \cdot h}&lt;/math&gt;

The mean radius of the earth is about {{convert|6378|km}}. (See [[Earth radius]]) Using the same units for both the altitude of the station and the radius of the earth,

: &lt;math&gt;d \approx \sqrt{ 2\cdot 6378 \cdot h} \approx 112.9 \cdot \sqrt{h} &lt;/math&gt;

But the radius of Earth is given in kilometers. Converting the equation for '''distance in kilometers''' and '''height in meter''',

&lt;math&gt;d_{km} \approx \sqrt{ 2\cdot 6378_{km} \cdot h_m} = \sqrt{ 2\cdot 6378_{km} \cdot h_m \cdot \frac{1_{km}}{1000_m}}=\sqrt{ \frac{2\cdot 6378}{1000}}(\sqrt{h_m}) km &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;d_{km}&lt;/math&gt;is the distance in kilometers and &lt;math&gt;h_m&lt;/math&gt;is in meters. Thus, if the height is given in '''m.''' and distance  in '''km''',

: &lt;math&gt;d \approx 3.57 \cdot \sqrt{h}&lt;/math&gt;

If the height is given in '''ft.''' and the distance in '''miles''',

: &lt;math&gt;d \approx 1.23 \cdot \sqrt{h}&lt;/math&gt;

Of course the presence of hills or mountains between the transmitter and receiver may reduce this distance.

== The actual service range ==

The above analysis doesn’t take the effect of atmosphere on the propagation path of the RF signals into consideration. In fact, the RF signals don’t propagate in straight lines. Because of the canalizing effects of atmospheric layers, the propagation paths are somewhat curved. Thus, the maximum service range of the station, is not equal to the [[line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] distance. Usually a factor '''k''' is used in the equation above 

: &lt;math&gt;d \approx \sqrt{2 \cdot k \cdot R \cdot h} &lt;/math&gt;

'''k &gt; 1''' means geometrically reduced bulge and a longer service range. On the other hand,  '''k &lt; 1''' means a shorter service range.

Experience has shown that, under normal weather conditions '''k''' is '''4/3'''.&lt;ref&gt;R.Busi: ''Technical Monograph 3108-1967 High Altitude VHF and UHF Broadcasting Stations'', European Broadcasting Union Brussels,1967&lt;/ref&gt; That means that, the maximum service range increases by 15%.

:&lt;math&gt;d \approx \sqrt{17h}\approx 4.12 \cdot \sqrt{h} &lt;/math&gt;
for '''h''' in '''m.''' and '''d''' in '''km.''' 

:&lt;math&gt;d \approx \sqrt{2h}\approx 1.41 \cdot\sqrt{h} &lt;/math&gt;
for '''h''' in '''ft.''' and '''d''' in '''miles''' ; 

But in stormy weather, '''k''' may decrease to cause fading in transmission. (In extreme cases '''k''' can be less than '''1'''.) That is equivalent to a hypothetical decrease in Earth radius and an increase of Earth bulge.&lt;ref&gt;This analysis is for high altitude to sea level reception. In [[microwave relay]] links, both stations are often located at high points in the terrain.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

In normal weather conditions, the service range of a  transmitting station at an altitude of   '''1500 m.''' with respect to receivers at sea level can be found as,

: &lt;math&gt;d \approx 4.12 \cdot \sqrt{1500} = 160 \mbox { km.}&lt;/math&gt;

== Earth Bulge Given a Certain Height ==
Let '''d''' be the distance in '''km''' from the observer to the maximum earth bulge, '''h''' be the height in '''m''' of earth bulge and '''k''' the bulging factor. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=K4ribVEOhSAC&amp;q=193#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Telecommunication System Engineering|last=Freeman|first=Roger L.|date=2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471451334|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1

which shows a dependency on the observer distance. This gives zero bulge at the location of the observers and maximum at its midpoint. To prove the equation, taking the equation for '''d''' with '''k''' budge factor,

&lt;math&gt;d \approx \sqrt{2 \cdot k \cdot R \cdot h_m}=\sqrt{2\cdot 6378 \cdot k\cdot h_m}=\sqrt{12.756 \cdot k\cdot h_{km}} &lt;/math&gt;

Having &lt;math&gt;d_1=d_2=d&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;h_1=h_2=h&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;h= \frac{\sqrt{12.756 \cdot k\cdot h_{km}}\sqrt{12.756 \cdot k\cdot h_{km}}}{12.75k}=\frac{12.756 \cdot k\cdot h_{km}}{12.75k}\therefore=h &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Endosymbiosis.PNG|thumb|200px|A representation of the [[endosymbiotic theory]]]]

An '''endosymbiont''' or '''endobiont'''&lt;ref name="KingDom"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Margulis |first1=Lynn |author1link=Lynn Margulis |last2=Chapman |first2=Michael J. |title=Kingdoms &amp; domains an illustrated guide to the phyla of life on Earth |date=2009 |publisher=Academic Press/Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-08-092014-6 |page=493 |edition=4th |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=9IWaqAOGyt4C&amp;pg=PA493 |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is any [[organism]] that lives within the body or cells of another organism in a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] (formerly called symbiotic) relationship with the host body or cell, often but not always [[mutualism (biology)|to mutual benefit]].
The term '''endosymbiosis''' is from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: ἔνδον ''endon'' "within", σύν ''syn'' "together" and βίωσις ''biosis'' "living"). Examples are [[nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacteria]] (called [[rhizobia]]), which live in [[root nodule]]s on [[legume]] roots, single-cell [[algae]] inside reef-building [[coral]]s, and bacterial endosymbionts that provide essential nutrients to about 10–15% of insects.

Many instances of endosymbiosis are obligate; that is, either the endosymbiont or the host cannot survive without the other, such as the [[Siboglinidae|gutless marine worms]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Riftia]]'', which get nutrition from their endosymbiotic bacteria. The most common examples of obligate endosymbioses are [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. Some human parasites, e.g. ''[[Wuchereria bancrofti]]'' and ''[[Mansonella perstans]]'', thrive in their intermediate insect hosts because of an obligate endosymbiosis with ''[[Wolbachia]] spp.'' They can both be eliminated from said hosts by treatments that target this bacterium. However, not all endosymbioses are obligate and some endosymbioses can be [[symbiosis|harmful]] to either of the organisms involved.

Two major types of [[organelle]] in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic cells]], [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[plastid]]s such as [[chloroplast]]s, originated by [[symbiogenesis]] as bacterial endosymbionts.

While other species like that of the UNCY-A symbiont and Richelia have reduced genomes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  This reduction in genome size occurs within nitrogen metabolism pathways indicating endosymbiont species are generating nitrogen for their hosts and losing the ability to use this nitrogen independently.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This endosymbiont reduction in genome size, might be a step that occurred in the evolution of organelles (above).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===In marine invertebrates===

Extracellular endosymbionts are also represented in all four extant classes of [[Echinodermata]] ([[Crinoidea]], [[Ophiuroidea]], [[Echinoidea]], and [[Holothuroidea]]). Little is known of the nature of the association (mode of infection, transmission, metabolic requirements, etc.) but [[phylogenetic]] analysis indicates that these symbionts belong to the alpha group of the class [[Proteobacteria]], relating them to ''Rhizobium'' and ''Thiobacillus''. Other studies indicate that these [[subcuticular bacteria]] may be both abundant within their hosts and widely distributed among the Echinoderms in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burnett WJ, McKenzie JD |title=Subcuticular bacteria from the brittle star ''Ophiactis balli'' (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea) represent a new lineage of extracellular marine symbionts in the alpha subdivision of the class Proteobacteria |journal=Appl. Environ. Microbiol. |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=1721–4 |date=1 May 1997|pmid=9143108 |pmc=168468 |url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9143108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some marine [[oligochaeta]] (e.g., ''[[Olavius]]'' and ''[[Inanidrillus]]'') have obligate extracellular endosymbionts that fill the entire body of their host. These marine worms are nutritionally dependent on their symbiotic [[chemoautotroph]]ic bacteria lacking any digestive or excretory system (no gut, mouth, or [[nephridia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dubilier, N.; Mülders, C.; Ferdelman, T. |title=Endosymbiotic sulphate-reducing and sulphide-oxidizing bacteria in an oligochaete worm |journal=Nature |volume=411 |issue=6835 |pages=298–302 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11357130 |doi=10.1038/35077067 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In protists===

''[[Mixotricha paradoxa]]'' is a protozoan that lacks mitochondria. However, spherical bacteria live inside the cell and serve the function of the mitochondria. ''Mixotricha'' also has three other species of symbionts that live on the surface of the cell.

''[[Paramecium bursaria]]'', a species of [[ciliate]], has a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with green alga called Zoochlorella. The algae live inside the cell, in the cytoplasm.

''[[Paulinella|Paulinella chromatophora]]'' is a freshwater [[amoeboid]] which has recently (evolutionarily speaking) taken on a [[cyanobacterium]] as an endosymbiont.

=== In insects ===

Scientists classify insect endosymbionts in two broad categories, 'Primary' and 'Secondary'. Primary endosymbionts (sometimes referred to as P-endosymbionts) have been associated with their [[insect]] hosts for many millions of years (from 10 to several hundred million years in some cases). They form obligate associations (see below), and display cospeciation with their insect hosts. Secondary endosymbionts exhibit a more recently developed association, are sometimes horizontally transferred between hosts, live in the [[hemolymph]] of the insects (not specialized bacteriocytes, see below), and are not obligate.&lt;ref&gt;P. Baumann, N. A. Moran and L. Baumann, Bacteriocyte-associated endosymbionts of insects in M.

As with endosymbiosis in other insects, the symbiosis is obligate in that neither the bacteria nor the insect is viable without the other. Scientists have been unable to cultivate the bacteria in lab conditions outside of the insect. With special nutritionally-enhanced diets, the insects can survive, but are unhealthy, and at best survive only a few generations.

In some insect groups, these endosymbionts live in specialized insect cells called [[bacteriocyte]]s (also called ''mycetocytes''), and are maternally-transmitted, i.e. the mother transmits her endosymbionts to her offspring. In some cases, the bacteria are transmitted in the [[Egg (biology)|egg]], as in ''Buchnera''; in others like ''Wigglesworthia'', they are transmitted via milk to the developing insect embryo. In termites, the endosymbionts reside within the hindguts and are transmitted through [[trophallaxis]] among colony members.

The primary endosymbionts are thought to help the host either by providing nutrients that the host cannot obtain itself or by metabolizing insect waste products into safer forms. For example, the putative primary role of ''Buchnera'' is to synthesize [[essential amino acid]]s that the aphid cannot acquire from its natural diet of plant sap. Likewise, the primary role of ''Wigglesworthia'', it is presumed, is to synthesize [[vitamin]]s that the tsetse fly does not get from the [[blood]] that it eats. In lower termites, the endosymbiotic protists play a major role in the digestion of lignocellulosic materials that constitute a bulk of the termites' diet.

Bacteria benefit from the reduced exposure to [[predator]]s and competition from other bacterial species, the ample supply of nutrients and relative environmental stability inside the host.

Genome sequencing reveals that obligate bacterial endosymbionts of insects have among the smallest of known bacterial genomes and have [[genome reduction|lost many genes]] that are commonly found in closely related bacteria. Several theories have been put forth to explain the loss of genes. It is presumed that some of these genes are not needed in the environment of the host insect cell. A complementary theory suggests that the relatively small numbers of bacteria inside each insect decrease the efficiency of natural selection in 'purging' deleterious mutations and small mutations from the population, resulting in a loss of genes over many millions of years. Research in which a parallel [[phylogeny]] of bacteria and insects was inferred supports the belief that the primary endosymbionts are transferred only vertically (i.e., from the mother), and not horizontally (i.e., by escaping the host and entering a new host).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wernegreen JJ |title=Primer – Endosymbiosis: Lessons in Conflict Resolution |journal=PLoS Biol |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=e68 |year=2004 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020068 |url=http://www.plosbiology.org/plosonline/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020068 |pmid=15024418 |pmc=368163 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040414043954/http://www.plosbiology.org/plosonline/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0020068 |archivedate=14 April 2004 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wernegreen JJ |title=Genome evolution in bacterial endosymbionts of insects |journal=Nat.

Attacking obligate bacterial endosymbionts may present a way to control their insect hosts, many of which pests or carriers of human disease. For example, aphids are crop pests and the tsetse fly carries the organism ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]'' that causes African [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aksoy S, Maudlin I, Dale C, Robinson AS, O'Neill SL |title=Prospects for control of African trypanosomiasis by tsetse vector manipulation |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=29–35 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11137738 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1471-4922(00)01850-X |doi=10.1016/S1471-4922(00)01850-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other motivations for their study is to understand symbiosis, and to understand how bacteria with severely depleted genomes are able to survive, thus improving our knowledge of [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]].

Less is known about secondary endosymbionts. The pea aphid (''[[Acyrthosiphon pisum]]'') is known to contain at least three secondary endosymbionts, ''[[Hamiltonella defensa]]'', ''[[Regiella insecticola]]'', and ''[[Serratia symbiotica]]''. ''H. defensa'' aids in defending the insect from parasitoids. ''[[Sodalis glossinidius]]'' is a secondary endosymbiont of tsetse flies that lives inter- and intracellularly in various host tissues, including the midgut and hemolymph. Phylogenetic studies have not indicated a correlation between evolution of ''[[Sodalis]]'' and tsetse.&lt;ref&gt;Aksoy, S., Pourhosseini, A. &amp; Chow, A. 1995. Mycetome endosymbionts of tsetse flies constitute a distinct lineage related to Enterobacteriaceae. Insect Mol Biol.

== Dinoflagellate endosymbionts ==

[[Dinoflagellate]] endosymbionts of the genus ''Symbiodinium'', commonly known as [[zooxanthella]]e, are found in [[corals]], [[mollusk]]s (esp. [[giant clam]]s, the ''Tridacna''), [[sea sponge|sponges]], and [[foraminifera]]. These endosymbionts drive the formation of [[coral reefs]] by capturing sunlight and providing their hosts with energy for [[carbonate]] deposition.&lt;ref name=Baker2003&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baker AC |title=FLEXIBILITY AND SPECIFICITY IN CORAL-ALGAL SYMBIOSIS: Diversity, Ecology, and Biogeography of Symbiodinium |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |volume=34 |pages=661–89 |date=November 2003 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132417 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146%2Fannurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously thought to be a single species, molecular [[phylogenetic]] evidence over the past couple decades has shown there to be great diversity in ''Symbiodinium''. In some cases, there is specificity between host and ''Symbiodinium'' [[clade]]. More often, however, there is an ecological distribution of ''Symbiodinium'', the symbionts switching between hosts with apparent ease. When reefs become environmentally stressed, this distribution of symbionts is related to the observed pattern of [[coral bleaching]] and recovery. Thus, the distribution of ''Symbiodinium'' on coral reefs and its role in coral bleaching presents one of the most complex and interesting current problems in reef [[ecology]].&lt;ref name=Baker2003/&gt;

==Viral endosymbionts==
{{main|Endogenous retrovirus}}

The human genome project found several thousand [[endogenous retrovirus]]es, [[endogenous viral element]]s in the [[genome]] that closely resemble and can be derived from [[retrovirus]]es, organized into 24 families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Villarreal LP |title=Persisting Viruses Could Play Role in Driving Host Evolution |journal=ASM News |date=October 2001 |publisher=American Society for Microbiology |url=http://newsarchive.asm.org/oct01/feature1.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508113235/http://newsarchive.asm.org/oct01/feature1.asp |archivedate=8 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbiogenesis and organelles ==
{{Main|Symbiogenesis}}

Symbiogenesis explains the origins of [[eukaryote]]s, whose cells contain two major kinds of [[organelle]], [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. The theory proposes that these organelles evolved from certain types of bacteria that eukaryotic cells engulfed through [[cytosis|endophagocytosis]]. These cells and the bacteria trapped inside them entered an endosymbiotic relationship, meaning that the bacteria lived within the eukaryotic cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sagan, Lynn |authorlink=Lynn Margulis |year=1967 |title=On the origin of mitosing cells |journal=[[J Theor Biol]] |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=255–274 |pmid=11541392 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(67)90079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British '''Entertainment in the 16th century''' included art, fencing, painting, the stocks and even executions.

While the 16th century and early 17th century squarely fall into the [[Renaissance]] period in Europe, that period was not only one of scientific and cultural advance, but also involved the development of changing forms of entertainment – both for the masses and for the elite.

Despite the great breadth of advancements in the arts during this time, the economic conditions of this period affected the types of entertainment available. There were three classes in society: A wealthy [[nobility]], a [[Bourgeoisie|merchant class]],  and the [[Peasant|peasantry]], who were typically poor.

==Aristocratic amusements==
The nobility could commission [[artisans]] to entertain them with works of art, music and theatre (Kareti, 1997).  They would also enjoy or participate in the sports of [[fencing]], [[falconry]], [[horse riding]] and [[hunting]]; they enjoyed extravagant parties and dances, attended the opera house, and had the best seats in the theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tudors: Entertainment|url=http://www.historyonthenet.com/Tudors/entertainment.htm|accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At that time [[Cricket]] was also a game associated with the nobility.  In 1563, [[Lawrence Humphrey]] praised the five classic sports of Greece for the nobility – "whirling, leaping, casting the darte, wrestling, running" and derided "dauncing, fayninge to instrumentes, playe at dise, chesse, or tennes."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/read/109659971/sport-politics-and-literature-in-the-english-renaissance Sport, Politics, and Literature in the English Renaissance]  Gregory M. Colón Semenza;  University of Delaware; 2003 229 pages pp 11 et seq&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merchant merriment==
The middle class of [[merchants]], [[wright]]s, inn keepers and the like, would occasionally enjoy the fine arts, for example the theater. [[Blood sport]]s were popular – including [[bear baiting]], [[bull baiting]], [[dog fighting]] and [[Cockfight|cockfighting]]. Travelling troupes of actors entertained the masses. Enterprising [[bards]] would settle and build theaters – such as [[William Shakespeare]]’s [[Globe Theater]] (The Old Globe Theater History, 2005) in [[London, England|London]].

==Deprived diversions==
The poor could rarely afford the theater, generally having to stand as [[groundling]]s.  [[Executions]] were seen as a form of entertainment (Alchin, 2005), as was attending [[public humiliation]]s in the [[stocks]]. Another popular public event with spectators, was the [[Witch-hunt|witch trial]] by use of [[Trial by ordeal#Witch-hunts|water trial]].(Lambert, 2007).

[[Image:analytic.svg|thumb|300px|right|A signal in blue and the magnitude of its [[analytic signal]] in red, showing the envelope effect]]

An '''envelope detector''' is an electronic circuit that takes a (relatively) high-frequency amplitude modulated  signal as input and provides an output which is the [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] of the original signal.

==Circuit operation==
The [[capacitor]] in the circuit above stores charge on the rising edge and releases it slowly through the [[resistor]] when the input signal amplitude falls. The diode in series [[Rectifier|rectifies]] the incoming signal, allowing current flow only when the positive input terminal is at a higher potential than the negative input terminal.

==General considerations ==
Most practical envelope detectors use either half-wave or full-wave [[Rectifier|rectification]] of the signal to convert the [[Alternating current|AC]] audio input into a pulsed [[Direct current|DC]] signal. [[Electronic filter|Filtering]] is then used to smooth the final result. This filtering is rarely perfect and some "ripple" is likely to remain on the envelope follower output, particularly for low frequency inputs such as notes from a bass instrument. Reducing the filter cutoff frequency gives a smoother output, but decreases the high frequency response. Therefore, practical designs must reach a compromise.

== Definition of the envelope ==
Any [[amplitude modulation|AM]] [[frequency modulation|FM]] signal &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be written in the following form
: &lt;math&gt;x(t) = R(t) \cos ( \omega t + \varphi(t) ) \,&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of AM, φ(''t'') (the phase component of the signal) is constant and can be ignored. In AM, the [[carrier frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is also constant. Thus, all the information in the AM signal is in ''R''(''t''). ''R''(''t'') is called the '''envelope''' of the signal. Hence an AM signal is given by the function
: &lt;math&gt;x(t) = (C + m(t)) \cos(\omega t) \,&lt;/math&gt;
with ''m''(''t'') representing the original audio frequency message, ''C'' the carrier amplitude and ''R''(''t'') equal to ''C'' + ''m''(''t''). So, if the envelope of the AM signal can be extracted, the original message can be recovered.

In the case of FM, the transmitted &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; has a [[constant envelope]] ''R''(''t'') = R and can be ignored.
However, many FM receivers measure the envelope anyway for [[received signal strength indication]].

== Diode detector ==
The simplest form of envelope detector is the '''[[diode detector]]''' which is shown above. A diode detector is simply a [[diode]] between the input and output of a circuit, connected to a resistor and capacitor in parallel from the output of the circuit to the ground. If the resistor and capacitor are correctly chosen, the output of this circuit should approximate a voltage-shifted version of the original ([[baseband]]) signal. A simple filter can then be applied to filter out the DC component.

== Precision detector ==
An envelope detector can also be constructed to use a '''[[precision rectifier]]''' feeding into a [[low-pass filter]].

== Drawbacks ==
The envelope detector has several drawbacks:
* The input to the detector must be [[band-pass filter]]ed around the desired signal, or else the detector will simultaneously demodulate several signals. The filtering can be done with a tunable filter or, more practically, a [[superheterodyne receiver]]
* It is more susceptible to noise than a [[product detector]]
* If the signal is [[overmodulation|overmodulated]], distortion will occur
Most of these drawbacks are relatively minor and are usually acceptable tradeoffs for the simplicity and low cost of using an envelope detector.

== Demodulation of signals ==
An envelope detector can be used to [[demodulate]] a previously modulated signal by removing all high frequency components of the signal. The capacitor and resistor form a low-pass filter to filter out the carrier frequency. Such a device is often used to demodulate AM radio signals because the envelope of the modulated signal is equivalent to the [[baseband]] signal.

== Audio ==
{{also|Noise gate#Trance gating}}
An envelope detector is sometimes referred to as an '''envelope follower''' in [[music]]al environments. It is still used to detect the [[amplitude]] variations of an incoming signal to produce a control signal that resembles those variations. However, in this case the input signal is made up of audible frequencies.

Envelope detectors are often a component of other circuits, such as a [[Audio level compression|compressor]] or an [[auto-wah]] or envelope-followed filter. In these circuits, the envelope follower is part of what is known as the "[[Side chain (sound)|side chain]]", a circuit which describes some characteristic of the input, in this case its volume.

Both [[Dynamic range compression|expanders]] and [[Audio level compression|compressors]] use the envelope's output voltage to control the gain of an amplifier. Auto-wah uses the voltage to control the [[cutoff frequency]] of a filter. The [[voltage-controlled filter]] of an [[analog synthesizer]] is a similar circuit.

Modern envelope followers can be implemented: 
# directly as [[electronic hardware]],
# or as software using either a [[digital signal processor]] (DSP) or
# on a general purpose CPU.

'''NCF-Envirothon''' is an annual [[environmental movement|environmentally themed]] [[academic]] competition for high school aged students organized by the NCF-Envirothon a program of the National Conservation Foundation. The competition is held by the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] on a regional, state, and bi-national level. Envirothon combines in-class and hands-on environmental education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Forestry Association New Brunswick|url=http://www.cfanb.ca/the_envirothon_experience|publisher=CFANB|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in a competition setting which involves a problem-solving presentation as well as written field tests. The competition tests students on five core subjects- [[aquatic ecology]], [[forestry]], [[soils|soils and land use]], [[wildlife]]- along with a fifth annually-changing subtopic which focuses on relevant environmental issues. Currently, roughly 500,000 students from forty-five U.S. states and nine Canadian provinces/territories participate in the competition.&lt;ref name = "canon enviro"&gt;{{Citation
  | title = NCF-Envirothon Official Webpage
  | year = 2008
  | url = http://envirothon.vologon.com/index.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

States and provinces across the United States and Canada each have their own local competitions from which the winning high school team earns the privilege of representing their state/province at the NCF-Envirothon competition, held each summer in a different U.S. state or Canadian province. In areas with a considerable number of teams, subdivisions such as county, regional, or district competitions are also held.  Teams must win these intermediary competitions in order to move on to the state/province levels.

==Organizers and Sponsors==
The NCF-Envirothon is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)3]] [[Nonprofit organization]] headquartered in Washington,D.C. Coordinating the delivery of the North American competition, the organization also relies heavily on volunteers across North America to advise individual teams from each participating state and province.&lt;ref name="Envirothon: About Us"&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Envirothon: About Us|url=http://www.envirothon.org/about-us.html|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governing the program is the National Conservation Foundation (NCF) Executive, along with a NCF-Evirothon Operating Committee which is made up of representatives from participating states and provinces.&lt;ref name="History of Envirothon" /&gt;

Envirothon is sponsored by the [[National Natural Resources Conservation Foundation|National Conservation Foundation]], the [[Conservation district|National Association of Conservation Districts]], the [[United States Forest Service]], and the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]].&lt;ref name="Envirothon: Sponsors"&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Envirothon: Sponsors|url=http://www.envirothon.org/sponsors.html|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Individual teams are often sponsored by school clubs or classes, local businesses and governments, or [[4H]] and other such non-scholastic organizations.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

==Competition==

Competition participants are generally teams of five students with one to two team advisers. Home-schoolers can also take part as their own team.

States and provinces across the United States and Canada each have their own local competitions from which the winning high school team earns the privilege of representing their state/province at the North American Envirothon Competition, held each summer in a different U.S. state or Canadian province. In regions with a considerable number of teams, competitions on subdivision, county, regional, or district levels are also held.  Teams must win these intermediary competitions in order to move on to the state/province levels. At the North American Competition, teams that rank first through tenth receive prizes and scholarships of various values.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

Competition week at the NCF-Envirothon level includes various workshops, field trips, and seminars led by professionals and educators for both the students and their advisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Forestry Association|url=http://www.canadianforestry.com/html/education/envirothon_e.html|publisher=CFA|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these outings are linked to the current issue topic and provide information on the area in which the competition is being held.

During the competition, each team must complete five written field tests, each dealing with a different topic. These tests consist of various question types, including identifications and hands-on assessments. Each team must also prepare an oral presentation on the current issue topic, which the team presents to a panel of judges. An important element of the competition is the understanding that each topic is interrelated, and understanding human effects on the environment and how human activities connect with ecosystem functions. Each test is scored out of 100 points, with the presentation being scored out of 200 points. The team with the highest cumulative total of points at the end of the scoring is the winning team. Recognition is also given to teams with the highest scoring in each of the five categories.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

===Competition locations===
The location of the North American competition is determined based on a regional map that separates North America into five general regions: Far West, Mid-West, Southeast, Northeast, and Far North. The host college or university is usually located in a different region than that of the year preceding it.&lt;ref name="Future Competitions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Envirothon: Future Competitions|url=http://www.envirothon.org/the-competition/future-competitions.html|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a competition (2013) was held in at [[Montana State University]] in [[Bozeman, Montana]] in the Far West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=MSU picked as site for 2014 NCF-Envirothon competition|url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/montana_state_university/article_1e391598-11ce-11e2-a7f7-0019bb2963f4.html|publisher=Bozeman Daily Chronicle|accessdate=20 November 2012|date=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 Competition===
The 2015 NCF-Envirothon competition will be held July 27-August 7, and hosted at [[Missouri State University]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]]. 45 states and 9 Canadian provinces and Territories will registered for the competition. The current Issue Topic for that year's competition is Urban/Community Forestry. This will be the second time that the state of [[Missouri]] Missouri Envirothon hosts the NCF-Envirothon Competition.&lt;ref name="Present Competition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Montana to Host North America’s Largest High School Natural Resource Competition|url=http://www.roundupweb.com/story/2012/09/26/news/montana-to-host-north-americas-largest-high-school-natural-resource-competition/1316.html|publisher=Roundup Web|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition Topics==
{{More references|section|date=January 2015}}

Each field test dealing with one of five competition topics requires both theoretical understandings and hand-on skills such as identification and chemical testing. Each topic also has a degree of relatedness to one another, which is sometimes considered in theoretical-based test questions.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

==History==
In 1979 the Pennsylvania Soil and Water Conservation Districts set up the Environmental Olympics, later renamed Enviro-Olympics, to encourage interest in environmental issues through hands-on competition.&lt;ref name="History of Envirothon"&gt;{{cite web|title=History Of Envirothon|url=http://www.envirothon.org/pdf/history.pdf|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=8 November 2012|author=April Smith|date=2 November 2010|year=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Expanding rapidly to include forty conservation districts by 1987, it gained attention from other states, and in 1988, the program became the National Envirothon, with participation from Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Ohio. In 1992 Nova Scotia became the first Canadian province to join the competition. The competition was sponsored by various state, local, and provincial conservation programs and associations until 1997 when [[Canon (company)|Canon Inc.]] began its support of the program, with local sponsors still supporting lower level competitions.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt; In 1999 Canon became the title sponsor of the competition between the U.S. states and Canadian provinces, with the competition being renamed the "Canon Envirothon." It is currently referred to as the "NCF-Envirothon."&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

'''Failure causes''' are defects in design, process, quality, or part application, which are the underlying cause of a failure or which initiate a process which leads to failure. Where failure depends on the user of the product or process, then [[human error]] must be considered.

==Component failure / Failure modes==

A part failure mode is the way in which a component fails "functionally" on the component level. Often a part has only a few failure modes. Thus a relay may fail to open or close contacts on demand. The failure mechanism that caused this can be of many different kinds, and often multiple factors play a role at the same time. They include [[corrosion]], [[welding]] of contacts due to an abnormal electric current, return spring [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue failure]], unintended command failure, dust accumulation and blockage of mechanism, etc. Seldom only one cause (hazard) can be identified that creates system failures. The real root causes can in theory in most cases be traced back to some kind of human error, e.g. design failure, operational errors, management failures, maintenance induced failures, specification failures, etc.

==Failure scenario==
A scenario is the complete identified possible sequence and combination of events, failures (failure modes), conditions, system states, leading to an end (failure) system state. It starts from causes (if known) leading to one particular end effect (the system failure condition). A failure scenario is for a system the same as the failure mechanism is for a component. Both result in a failure mode (state) of the system / component.

Rather than the simple description of symptoms that many product users or process participants might use, the term failure scenario / mechanism refers to a rather complete description, including the preconditions under which failure occurs, how the thing was being used, proximate and ultimate/final [[Causality (physics)|causes]] (if known), and any subsidiary or resulting failures that result.

The term is part of the engineering [[lexicon]], especially of engineers working to test and [[debugging|debug]] products or processes. Carefully observing and describing failure conditions, identifying whether failures are reproducible or transient, and hypothesizing what combination of conditions and sequence of events led to failure is part of the process of fixing design flaws or improving future [[iterations]]. The term may be applied to mechanical systems failure.

==Types of failure causes==
===Mechanical failure===
Some types of mechanical failure mechanisms are: excessive deflection, [[buckling]], [[ductile fracture]], [[brittle fracture]], [[impact (mechanics)|impact]], creep, relaxation, [[thermal shock]], [[wear]], corrosion,&lt;ref&gt;While corrosion is not technically a mechanical failure mode, it is usually included in mechanical failure modes because it leads directly to mechanical failures.&lt;/ref&gt; stress corrosion cracking, and various types of fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B2aAPVa1TloC|title=Metal Fatigue in Engineering|last=Stephens|first=Ralph I.|last2=Fatemi|first2=Ali|last3=Stephens|first3=Robert R.|last4=Fuchs|first4=Henry O.|date=2000-11-03|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9780471510598|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each produces a different type of fracture surface, and other indicators near the fracture surface(s). The way the product is loaded, and the loading history are also important factors which determine the outcome. Of critical importance is design geometry because [[stress concentrations]] can magnify the applied load locally to very high levels, and from which [[Fracture|cracks]] usually grow.

Over time, as more is understood about a failure, the failure cause evolves from a description of symptoms and outcomes (that is, effects) to a systematic and relatively abstract [[model (abstract)|model]] of how, when, and why the failure comes about (that is, causes).

The more complex the product or situation, the more necessary a good understanding of its failure cause is to ensuring its proper operation (or repair).  [[Cascading failure]]s, for example, are particularly complex failure causes. [[Edge case]]s and [[corner case]]s are situations in which complex, unexpected, and difficult-to-debug problems often occur.

=== Failure by corrosion ===
Materials can be degraded by their environment by [[corrosion]] processes, such as [[rusting]] in the case of [[iron]] and [[steel]]. Such processes can also be affected by load in the mechanisms of [[stress corrosion cracking]] and [[environmental stress cracking]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5700">'''Global Map''' is a set of digital maps that accurately cover the whole globe to express the status of global environment. It is developed through the cooperation of [[National mapping agency|National Geospatial Information Authorities]] (NGIAs) in the world. An initiative to develop Global Map under [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]], the Global Mapping Project, was advocated in 1992 by Ministry of Construction, Japan (MOC) at the time (the current [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Japan)|Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Japan]]-MLIT).

Global Map is digital [[geospatial information]] in 1&amp;nbsp;km [[Optical resolution|resolution]] which satisfies the following conditions:
# Covering the whole land area of the [[globe]]
# In consistent specifications
# Easily accessible by anyone in marginal cost
The global geospatial information developed as Global Map mainly consists of the following thematic layers:
* [[Transportation]] 
* [[Border|Boundary]] 
* [[Drainage]] 
* Population Centers 
* [[Elevation]] 
* [[Vegetation]] （Percent Tree Cover） 
* [[Land Cover]] 
* [[Land Use]]

== History of the Global Mapping Project ==
Since the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in 1972, global environmental challenges have been recognized as an issue which is common to humankind. “The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the [[Earth Summit]])” in Brazil in 1992 adopted “An action plan of humankind for sustainable development: [[Agenda 21]].” Agenda 21 describes in many parts the importance of information for decision-making to appropriately cope with global environmental challenges. Especially geospatial information is regarded to be critical.

In response to the objectives of Agenda 21 and in recognition of the need for further contribution to the development of geospatial information, the MOC at the time (the current MLIT) advocated, in the same year, the Global Mapping Project, an international cooperation initiative to develop global geospatial information to understand the present status and changes of global environment. This concept was presented at the Fifth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for the Americas in New York in 1993. At the same time, resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council
|accessdate=2012-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
calling for the promotion of the development of global geospatial data was adopted at this conference. Following this conference, a similar resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council
|accessdate=2012-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was adopted at Thirteenth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for Asia and the Pacific in Beijing in 1994.
 
In 1996, International Steering Committee for Global Mapping (ISCGM), which consists of heads or its equivalents of NGIAs, was established to promote the Global Mapping Project. Thus the mechanism for the international promotion was formed. The [[Geospatial Information Authority of Japan]] (GSI) has been serving as the secretariat of the ISCGM. In the following year, in 1997, which was five years after the Earth Summit, the nineteenth [[United Nations General Assembly#Special sessions|special session of the United Nations General Assembly]] (19th UNGASS) was held. At the paragraph 112 of the resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/spec/aress19-2.htm
|title=Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21
|date=1997-06-28
|publisher=United Nations
|accessdate=2012-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted by the 19th UNGASS, importance of a supportive environment to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection and processing, especially in developing countries, to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues was mentioned along with the description mentioning the significance of international cooperation, including global mapping, as a means to develop the supportive environment.

As a result of such movement, In 1998, a recommendatory letter to participate in the Global Mapping Project was sent from the [[United Nations]] to NGIAs of respective countries in the world.

Further, at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (Johannesburg Summit) held in 2002, global mapping was included in the Plan of Implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Gondwana 420 Ma.png|thumb|Gondwana 420 million years ago. View centered on the South Pole.]]
'''Gondwana''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ɡ|ɒ|n|d|ˈ|w|ɑː|n|ə}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Gondwana|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/gondwana|website= [[Reference.com|Dictionary.com]]|publisher= Lexico Publishing Group|access-date=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Gondwanaland''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Gondwanaland|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gondwana|publisher=[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]]|access-date=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[supercontinent]] that existed from the [[Neoproterozoic]] (about 550 million years ago) until the [[Carboniferous]] (about 320 million years ago). It was formed by the [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] of several [[craton]]s. Eventually, Gondwana became the largest piece of [[continental crust]] of the [[Paleozoic]] Era, covering an area of about {{Convert|100,000,000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Cocks|2013|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Carboniferous, it merged with [[Euramerica]] to form a larger supercontinent called [[Pangaea]]. Gondwana (and Pangaea) gradually broke up during the [[Mesozoic]] Era. The remnants of Gondwana make up about two-thirds of today's continental area, including [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Antarctica]], [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], and the [[Indian Subcontinent]].

The formation of Gondwana began {{Circa}}&amp;nbsp;{{Ma|800|650|{{Abbr|Ma|million years ago}}}} with the [[East African Orogeny]]&amp;nbsp;– the collision of India and Madagascar with East Africa&amp;nbsp;– and was completed {{Circa}} {{Ma|600|530|Ma}} with the overlapping [[Brasiliano orogeny|Brasiliano]] and [[Kuunga orogeny|Kuunga]] orogenies&amp;nbsp;– the collision of South America with Africa and the addition of Australia and Antarctica, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meert|Van Der Voo|1997|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of concept==
The continent of Gondwana was named by Austrian scientist [[Eduard Suess]], after the [[Gondwana (India)|Gondwana region]] of central [[India]] which is derived from [[Sanskrit]] for "forest of the [[Gondi people|Gonds]]". The name had been previously used in a geological context, first by [[Henry Benedict Medlicott|H.B. Medlicott]] in 1872,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Suess|1885|p=768}}: [https://archive.org/stream/dasantlitzderer02suesgoog#page/n760/mode/1up "Wir nennen es Gondwána-Land, nach der gemeinsamen alten Gondwána-Flora, … " (We name it Gondwána-Land, after the common ancient flora of Gondwána …)]&lt;/ref&gt; from which the Gondwana sedimentary sequences ([[Permian]]-[[Triassic]]) are also described.
The term "Gondwanaland" is preferred by some scientists in order to make a clear distinction between the region and the supercontinent.&lt;ref name="McL-2001-p272"&gt;{{Harvnb|McLoughlin|2001|loc=Gondwana or Gondwanaland?, pp. 272–273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
[[File:Kuunga2.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Eastern Gondwana.  {{Ma|620|550|Ma}} post-collisional extension of the East African Orogeny in blue and {{Ma|570|530|Ma}} collisional metamorphism of the Kuunga orogeny in red.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meert|2003|loc=Fig. 10, p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The assembly of Gondwana was a protracted process  during the Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic, which however remains incompletely understood because of the lack of paleo-magnetic data.  Several [[Orogeny|orogenies]], collectively known as the [[Pan-African orogeny]], led to the amalgamation of most of the continental fragments of a much older supercontinent, [[Rodinia]].  One of those orogenic belts, the [[Mozambique Belt]], formed {{Ma|800|650|Ma}} and was originally interpreted as the [[Suture (geology)|suture]] between East (India, Madagascar, Antarctica, and Australia) and West Gondwana (Africa and South America). Three orogenies were recognized during the 1990s: the [[East African Orogeny]] ({{Ma|650|800|Ma}}) and [[Kuunga orogeny]] (including the [[Malagasy Orogeny]] in southern Madagascar) ({{Ma|550|Ma}}) – the collision between East Gondwana and East Africa in two steps, and the [[Brasiliano orogeny]] ({{Ma|660|530|Ma}}) – the succesive collision between South American and African [[craton]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meert|Van Der Voo|1997|loc=Introduction, pp. 223–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final stages of Gondwanan assembly overlapped with the opening of the [[Iapetus Ocean]] between [[Laurentia]] and western Gondwana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Miashita|Yamamoto|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this interval, the [[Cambrian explosion]] occurred.
Laurentia was docked against the western shores of a united Gondwana for a short period near the Precambrian/Cambrian boundary, forming the short-lived and still disputed supercontinent [[Pannotia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meert|Van Der Voo|1997|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mozambique Ocean]] separated the [[Congo Craton|Congo]]–[[Tanzania Craton|Tanzania]]–[[Bangweulu Block]] of central Africa from Neoproterozoic India (India, the [[Antongil]] Block in far eastern Madagascar, the [[Seychelles]], and the Napier and Rayner Complexes in [[East Antarctica]]). The [[Azania]] continent&lt;ref&gt;Defined but not named in {{Harvnb|Collins|Pisarevsky|2005}}: "Azania" was a Greek name for the East African coast&lt;/ref&gt; (much of central [[Madagascar]], the [[Horn of Africa]] and parts of [[Yemen]] and Arabia) was an island in the Mozambique Ocean.

The Australia/[[East Antarctic Shield|Mawson]] continent was still separated from India, eastern Africa, and Kalahari by {{Circa}} {{Ma|600|Ma}}, when most of western Gondwana had already been amalgamated. By {{Circa}} 550&amp;nbsp;Ma, India had reached its Gondwanan position, which initiated the Kuunga orogeny (also known as the Pinjarra orogeny). Meanwhile, on the other side of the newly forming Africa, Kalahari collided with Congo and Rio de la Plata which closed the [[Adamastor Ocean]].  {{Circa}} 540–530&amp;nbsp;Ma, the closure of the Mozambique Ocean brought India next to Australia–East Antarctica, and both North and South China were located in proximity to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Li|Bogdanova|Collins|Davidson|2008|loc=The birth of Gondwanaland (600–530 Ma), p. 201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Positions of ancient continents, 550 million years ago.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Plate reconstruction|Reconstruction]] showing final stages of assembly of Gondwana, 550 Mya]]
As the rest of Gondwana formed, a complex series of orogenic events assembled the eastern parts of Gondwana (eastern Africa, Arabian-Nubian Shield, Seychelles, Madagascar, India, Sri Lanka, East Antarctica, and Australia) {{Circa}} {{Ma|750|530|Ma}}. First the Arabian-Nubian Shield collided with eastern Africa (in the Kenya-Tanzania region) in the [[East African Orogeny]] {{Circa}}{{Ma|750|620|Ma}}. Then Australia and East Antarctica were merged with the remaining Gondwana {{Circa}} {{Ma|570|530|Ma}} in the [[Kuunga Orogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meert|2003|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The later Malagasy orogeny at about 550–515&amp;nbsp;Mya affected Madagascar, eastern East Africa and southern India. In it, Neoproterozoic India collided with the already combined Azania and Congo–Tanzania–Bangweulu Block, suturing along the [[Mozambique Belt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grantham|Maboko|Eglington|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Convert|18000|km|abbr=on}}-long [[Terra Australis Orogen]] developed along Gondwana's western, southern, and eastern margins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cawood|2005|loc=Definition and Tectonic Framework, pp. 4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Proto-Gondwanan Cambrian arc belts from this margin have been found in eastern Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, and Antarctica.  Though these belts formed a continuous arc chain, the direction of subduction was different between the Australian-Tasmanian and New Zealand-Antarctica arc segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Münker|Crawford|2000|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peri-Gondwana development: Paleozoic rifts and accretions ==
A large number of terranes were accreted to Eurasia during Gondwana's existence but the Cambrian or Precambrian origin of many of these terranes remains uncertain.  For example, some Palaeozoic terranes and microcontinents that now make up Central Asia, often called the "Kazakh" and "Mongolian terranes", were progressively amalgamated into the continent [[Kazakhstania]] in the Late Silurian.  Whether these blocks originated on the shores of Gondwana is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Cocks|2013|loc=Marginal microcontinents and terranes, p. 1008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Early Palaeozoic the [[Armorican terrane]], which today form large parts of France, was part of either Peri-Gondwana or core Gondwana; the Rheic Ocean closed in front of it and the Palaeo-Tethys Ocean opened behind it.  Precambrian rocks from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] suggest it too probably formed part of core Gondwana before its detachment as an [[orocline]] in the [[Variscan orogeny]] close to the Carboniferous–Permian boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Cocks|2013|loc=Southern Europe, pp. 1008–1009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South-east Asia is made of Gondwanan and [[Cathaysia]]n continental fragments that were assembled during the Mid-Palaeozoic and Cenozoic.  This process can be divided into three phases of rifting along Gondwana's northern margin: firstly, in the Devonian, [[North China (continent)|North]] and [[South China (continent)|South China]], together with [[Tarim Block|Tarim]] and [[Quidam terrane|Quidam]] (north-western China) rifted, opening the Palaeo-Tethys behind them.  These terranes accreted to Asia during Late Devonian and Permian.  Secondly, in the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian, [[Cimmeria (continent)|Cimmerian terranes]] opened Meso-Tethys Ocean; [[Sibumasu]] and [[Qiantang terrane|Qiantang]] were added to south-east Asia during Late Permian and Early Jurassic.  Thirdly, in the Late Triassic to Late Jurassic, [[Lhasa terrane|Lhasa]], [[West Burma]], [[Woyla]] terranes opened the Neo-Tethys Ocean; Lhasa collided with Asia during the Early Cretaceous, and West Burma and Woyla during the Late Cretaceous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLoughlin|2001|loc=Cimmerian terranes, p. 278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gondwana's long, northern margin had remained a mostly passive margin throughout the Palaeozoic.  The Early Permian opening of the Neo-Tethys Ocean along this margin produced a long series of terranes, many of which were and still are being deformed in the [[Geology of the Himalaya|Himalaya Orogeny]].  From Turkey to north-eastern India: the Taurides in southern Turkey; the Lesser Caucasus Terrane in Georgia; the Sanand, Alborz, and Lut terranes in Iran; the Mangysglak or Kopetdag Terrane in the Caspian Sea; the Afghan Terrane; the Karakorum Terrane in northern Pakistan; and the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes in Tibet.  The Permian–Triassic widening of the Neo-Tethys pushed all these terranes across the Equator and over to Eurasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Cocks|2013|loc=South-central and eastern Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southwestern accretions===
During the Neoproterozoic to Palaeozoic phase of the [[Terra Australis Orogen]] a series of terranes were rafted from the proto-Andean margin when the Iapteus Ocean opened, to be added back to Gondwana during the closure of that ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cawood|2005|loc=Peri-Gondwanan continental basement assemblages, pp. 15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the paleozoic somne blocks which helped to form parts of the [[Southern Cone]] of South America, include a piece transferred from Laurentia when the west edge of Gondwana scraped against southeast Laurentia in the [[Ordovician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rapalini|2001}}; {{Harvnb|Rapalini|1998|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the [[Cuyania]] or Precordillera [[terrane]] of the [[Famatinian orogeny]] in northwest Argentina which may have continued the line of the [[Appalachians]] southwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dalla Salda|de Luchi|Cingolani|Varela|1998|loc=Abstract}}; {{Harvnb|Vujovich|van Staal|Davis|2004|loc=Conclusions, p. 1053}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chilenia]] terrane accreted later against Cuyania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ramos |first1=V.A.|author-link=Víctor Alberto Ramos |last2=Jordan |first2=T.E.|last3=Allmendinger |first3=R.W.|last4=Mpodozis |first4=C.|author-link4=Constantino Mpodozis|last5=Kay |first5=S.M.|last6=Cortés |first6=J.M. |last7=Palma |first7=M. |date=October 1986 |title=Paleozoic terranes of the central Argentina-Chilean Andes |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Victor_Ramos8/publication/252991522_Paleozoic_Terranes_of_the_Central_Argentine-Chilean_Andes/links/02e7e524d832ecca1b000000.pdf |journal=Tectonics |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=855–880 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collision of the Patagonian terrane with the southwestern Gondwanan occurred in the late Paleozoic.

==Gondwana as part of Pangaea: Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic==
[[File:Laurasia-Gondwana.svg|thumb|Gondwana formed part of Pangaea for {{Circa}} 150&amp;nbsp;Ma&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Li|Bogdanova|Collins|Davidson|2008|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Pangaea}}
Gondwana and [[Laurasia]] formed the Pangaea supercontinent during the Carboniferous.  Pangaea began to break up in the Mid-Jurassic when the [[Central Atlantic magmatic province|Central Atlantic opened]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Van Der Voo|2002|loc=Data selection and reconstruction fits, p. 772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the western end of Pangaea, the collision between Gondwana and Laurasia closed the [[Rheic Ocean|Rheic]] and [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean|Palaeo-Tethys]] oceans.  The obliquity of this closure resulted in the docking of some northern terranes in the [[Marathon Uplift|Marathon]], [[Ouachita orogeny|Ouachita]], [[Alleghanian orogeny|Alleghanian]], and [[Variscan orogeny|Variscan]] orogenies, respectively.  Southern terranes, such as [[Chortis Block|Chortis]] and [[Oaxaca Terrane|Oaxaca]], on the other hand, remained largely unaffected by the collision along the southern shores of Laurentia.  Some Peri-Gondwanan terranes, such as [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] and [[Florida]], were buffered from collisions by major promontories.  Other terranes, such as [[Carolina terrane|Carolina]] and [[Meguma terrane|Meguma]], were directly involved in the collision.  The final collision resulted in the Variscan-[[Appalachian Mountains]], stretching from present-day Mexico to southern Europe. Meanwhile, [[Baltica]] collided with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] and [[Kazakhstania]] which resulted in the [[Uralian orogeny]] and [[Laurasia]].  Pangaea was finally amalgamated in the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian, but the oblique forces continued until Pangaea began to rift in the Triassic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blakey|2003|loc=Assembly of Western Pangaea: Carboniferous–Permian, pp. 453–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eastern end collisions occurred slightly later.  The [[North China Craton|North China]], [[South China Craton|South China]], and [[Indochina Block|Indochina]] blocks rifted from Gondwana during the middle Paleozoic and opened the [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]].  North China docked with Mongolia and Siberia during the Carboniferous–Permian, followed by South China.  The [[Cimmeria (continent)|Cimmerian]] blocks then rifted from Gondwana to form the [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean|Palaeo-Thethys]] and [[Tethys Ocean|Neo-Tethys]] oceans in the Late Carboniferous, and docked with Asia during the Triassic and Jurassic.  Western Pangaea began to rift while the eastern end was still being assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blakey|2003|loc=Assembly of Eastern Pangaea: Late Permian–Jurassic, p. 454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of Pangaea and its mountains had a tremendous impact on global climate and sea levels, which resulted in glaciations and continent-wide sedimentation.  In North America, the base of the [[Absaroka sequence]] coincides with the Alleghanian and Ouachita orogenies and are indicative of a large-scale change in the mode of deposition far away from the Pangaean orogenies.  Ultimately, these changes contributed to the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] and left large deposits of hydrocarbons, coal, evaporite, and metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blakey|2003|loc=Summary: significance of Pangaean events, pp. 454–455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The break-up of Pangaea began with the [[Central Atlantic magmatic province]] (CAMP) between South America, Africa, North America, and Europe.  CAMP covered more than seven million square kilometres over a few million years, reached its peak at {{Circa}} {{Ma|200|Ma}}, and coincided with the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Marzoli|Renne|Piccirillo|Ernesto|1999|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reformed Gondwanan continent was not precisely the same as that which had existed before Pangaea formed; for example, most of [[Florida]] and southern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Alabama]] is underlain by rocks that were originally part of Gondwana, but this region stayed attached to North America when the [[Atlantic Ocean#Central Atlantic|Central Atlantic opened]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Gondwana Remnants in Alabama And Georgia: Uchee Is An 'Exotic' Peri-Gondwanan Arc Terrane, Not Part Of Laurentia | publisher = ScienceDaily | date = February 4, 2008 | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080204212810.htm | access-date=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Break-up==
===Mesozoic===
Antarctica, the centre of the supercontinent, shared boundaries with all other Gondwana continents and the fragmentation of Gondwana propagated clockwise around it.  The break-up was the result of one of the Earth's most extensive [[large igneous province]]s {{Circa}} {{Ma|200|170|Ma}}, but the oldest [[Magnetic anomaly|magnetic anomalies]] between South America, Africa, and Antarctica are found in what is now the southern [[Weddell Sea]] where initial break-up occurred during the Jurassic {{Circa}} {{Ma|160|180|Ma}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jokat|Boebel|König|Meyer|2003|loc=Introduction, pp. 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gondwana began to break up in the early [[Jurassic]] following the extensive and fast emplacement of the [[Karoo-Ferrar]] [[flood basalt]]s {{Circa}} {{Ma|184|Ma}}.  Before the Karoo plume initiated rifting between Africa and Antarctica, it separated a series of smaller continental blocks from Gondwana's southern, Proto-Pacific margin (along what is now the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]): the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], [[Marie Byrd Land]], [[Zealandia]], and [[Thurston Island]]; the [[Falkland Islands]] and [[Ellsworth–Whitmore Mountains]] (in Antarctica) were rotated 90° in opposite directions; and South America south of the [[Gastre Fault]] (often referred to as [[Tectonic evolution of Patagonia|Patagonia]]) was pushed westward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Encarnación|Fleming|Elliot|Eales|1996|loc=Early rifting and Gondwana breakup, pp. 537–538}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the Africa-Antarctica break-up can be studied in great detail in the fracture zones and magnetic anomalies flanking the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Royer|Patriat|Bergh|Scotese|1988|loc=Figg. 7 a–j, pp. 248–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Madagascar block and the [[Mascarene Plateau]], stretching from the [[Seychelles]] to [[Réunion]], were broken off India; elements of this breakup nearly coincide with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. The India–Madagascar–Seychelles separations appear to coincide with the eruption of the [[Deccan Traps|Deccan basalts]], whose eruption site may survive as the [[Réunion hotspot]].  The Seychelles and the [[Maldives]] are now separated by the [[Central Indian Ridge]].

During the initial break-up in the Early Jurassic a [[transgression (geology)|marine transgression]] swept over the [[Horn of Africa]] covering Triassic [[planation surface]]s with [[sandstone]], [[limestone]], [[shale]], [[marl]]s and [[evaporite]]s.&lt;ref name=Abbate2015&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbate |first=Ernesto|last2=Bruni |first2=Piero|last3=Sagri |first3=Mario |date=2015|editor-last=Billi|editor-first=Paolo |title=Landscapes and Landforms of Ethiopia |chapter=Geology of Ethiopia: A Review and Geomorphological Perspectives|series=World Geomorphological Landscapes |location= |publisher= |pages=33–64 |isbn=978-94-017-8026-1 |author-link= |doi=10.1007/978-94-017-8026-1_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coltortietal2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coltorti |first1=M. |last2=Dramis |first2=F.|last3=Ollier |first3=C.D.|author-link3=Cliff Ollier |date=2007 |title=Planation surfaces in Northern Ethiopia |url= |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=89 |issue= |pages=287–296 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The [[Atlantic Ocean#South Atlantic|opening of the South Atlantic Ocean]] divided West Gondwana (South America and Africa), but there is a considerable debate over the exact timing of this break-up.  Rifting propagated from south to north along Triassic–Early Jurassic lineaments, but intra-continental rifts also began to develop within both continents in Jurassic–Cretaceous sedimentary basins; subdividing each continent into three sub-plates.  Rifting began {{Circa}} {{Ma|190|Ma}} at Falkland latitudes, forcing Patagonia to move relative to the still static remainder of South America and Africa, and this westward movement lasted until the Early Cretaceous {{Ma|126.7|Ma}}.  From there rifting propagated northward during the Late Jurassic {{Circa}} {{Ma|150|Ma}} or Early Cretaceous {{Circa}} {{Ma|140|Ma}} most likely forcing dextral movements between sub-plates on either side.  South of the [[Walvis Ridge]] and [[Rio Grande Rise]] the [[Paraná and Etendeka traps|Paraná and Etendeka magmatics]] resulted in further ocean-floor spreading {{Circa}} {{Ma|130|135|Ma}} and the development of rifts systems on both continents, including the [[West and Central African Rift System|Central African Rift System]] and the [[Central African Shear Zone]] which lasted until {{Circa}} {{Ma|85|Ma}}.  At Brazilian latitudes spreading is more difficult to assess because of the lack of palaeo-magnetic data, but rifting occurred in Nigeria at the [[Benue Trough]] {{Circa}} {{Ma|118|Ma}}.  North of the Equator the rifting began after {{Ma|120.4|Ma}} and continued until {{Circa}} {{Ma|100|96|Ma}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|Müller|Zahirovic|Gaina|2012|loc=South Atlantic, pp. 217–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early Andean orogeny====
The first phases of [[Andean orogeny]] in the [[Jurassic]] and [[Early Cretaceous]] were characterized by [[extensional tectonics]], [[rift]]ing, the development of [[back-arc basin]]s and the emplacement of large [[batholith]]s.&lt;ref name=Ramosmemoir2009&gt;{{Harvnb|Ramos|2009|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Charrieretal45-46&gt;{{Harvnb|Charrier|Pinto|Rodríguez|2006|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development is presumed to have been linked to the subduction of cold [[oceanic crust|oceanic]] [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref name=Charrieretal45-46/&gt; During the mid to [[Late Cretaceous]] (ca. 90 million years ago) the Andean orogeny changed significantly in character.&lt;ref name=Ramosmemoir2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Charrieretal45-46/&gt; Warmer and younger oceanic lithosphere is believed to have started to be subducted beneath South America around this time. Such kind of subduction is held responsible not only for the intense contractional [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] that different lithologies were subject to, but also the [[mountain building|uplift]] and [[erosion]] known to have occurred from the Late Cretaceous onward.&lt;ref name=Charrieretal45-46/&gt; [[Plate tectonics|Plate tectonic]] reorganization since the mid-Cretaceous might also have been linked to the [[rift|opening]] of the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=Ramosmemoir2009/&gt; Another change related to mid-Cretaceous plate tectonic changes was the change of subduction direction of the oceanic lithosphere that went from having south-east motion to having a north-east motion at about 90 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Hoffmannetal2006&gt;{{Harvnb|Hoffmann-Rothe|Kukowski|Dresen|Echtler|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; While subduction direction changed it remained oblique (and not perpendicular) to the coast of South America, and the direction change affected several [[subduction|subduction zone]]-parallel faults including [[Atacama Fault|Atacama]], [[Domeyko Fault|Domeyko]] and [[Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault|Liquiñe-Ofqui]].&lt;ref name=Charrieretal45-46/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoffmannetal2006/&gt;

===Cenozoic===
The [[Indian subcontinent]] began to collide with Asia {{Circa}} {{Ma|70|Ma}} since when more than {{Convert|1400|km|abbr=on}} of crust has been absorbed by the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]]-[[Tibet]]an orogen.  During the Cenozoic the orogen resulted in the construction of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] between the Tethyan Himalayas in the south and the [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun]] and [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian]] mountains in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yin|Harrison|2000|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, South America was connected to North America via the [[Isthmus of Panama]], cutting off a circulation of warm water and thereby making the [[Arctic]] colder,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luyendyk|Forsyth|Phillips|1972|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as allowing the [[Great American Interchange]].

The breakup of Gondwana can be said to continue in eastern Africa at the [[Afar Triple Junction]], which separates the [[Arabian Plate|Arabian]], [[Nubian Plate|Nubian]], and [[Somali Plate|Somali]] plates, resulting in rifting in the [[Red Sea]] and [[East African Rift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jestin|Huchon|Gaulier|1994|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia–Antarctica separation====
In the Early [[Cenozoic]] Australia was still connected to Antarctica {{Circa}} 35–40° south of its current location and both continents were largely unglaciated.  A rift between the two developed but remained an embayment until the Eocene-Oligocene boundary when the Circumpolar Current developed and the glaciation of Antarctica began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|2006|loc=Palaeogeography, pp. 538–539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia was warm and wet during the Palaeocene and dominated by rainforest.  The opening of the Tasman Gateway at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary ({{Ma|33|Ma}}) resulted in abrupt cooling but the Oligocene became a period of high rainfall with swamps in southeast Australia.  During the Miocene a warm and humid climate developed with pockets of rainforests in central Australia but before the end of the period colder and drier climate severely reduced this rainforest.  A brief period of increased rainfall in the Pliocene was followed by drier climate which favoured grassland.  Since then the fluctuation between wet interglacial periods and dry glacial periods has developed into the present arid regime.  Australia has thus experienced various climate changes over a 15 million year period with a gradual decrease in precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|2006|loc=Conclusions, pp. 557–558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tasman Gateway between Australia and Antarctica began to open {{Circa}} {{Ma|40|30|Ma}}.  Palaeontological evidences indicate the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] (ACC) was established in the Late Oligocene {{Circa}} {{Ma|23|Ma}} with the full opening of the [[Drake Passage]] and the deepening of the Tasman Gateway.  The oldest oceanic crust in the Drake Passage, however, is {{Ma|34|29|Ma}}-old which indicates spreading between the Antarctic and South American plates began near the Eocene/Oligocene boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lagabrielle|Goddéris|Donnadieu|Malavieille|2009|loc=Timing of opening of the Drake Passage region, pp. 198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Deep sea environments in [[Tierra del Fuego]] and the [[North Scotia Ridge]] during the Eocene and Oligocene indicate a "Proto-ACC" opened during this period.  Later, {{Ma|26|14|Ma}}, a series of events severally restricted the Proto-ACC: change to shallow marine conditions along the North Scotia Ridge; closure of the Fuegan Seaway, the deep sea that existed in Tierra del Fuego; and uplift of the Patagonian Cordillera.  This, together with the reactivated [[Iceland plume]], contributed to global warming.  During the Miocene, the Drake Passage began to widen and as water flow between South America and the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] increased, the renewed ACC resulted in cooler global climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lagabrielle|Goddéris|Donnadieu|Malavieille|2009|loc=Conclusions, p. 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Eocene the northward movement of the Australian Plate has resulted in an [[arc-continent]] collision with the [[Philippine Sea Plate|Philippine]] and [[Caroline Plate|Caroline]] plates and the uplift of the [[New Guinea Highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|Hall|2003|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the Oligocene to the late Miocene, the climate in Australia, dominated by warm and humid rainforests before this collision, began to alternate between open forest and rainforest before the continent became the arid or semiarid landscape it is today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Travouillon|Legendre|Archer|Hand|2009|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Cambrian diversification===
During the [[Silurian]] Gondwana extended from the Equator (Australia) to the South Pole (North Africa and South America) whilst Laurasia was located on the Equator opposite to Australia.  A short-lived [[Late Ordovician glaciation]] was followed by a Silurian [[Greenhouse and icehouse Earth|Hot House]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=SILURIAN: terrestrial life appears in the tropics, p. 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the Ordovician ''[[Cooksonia]]'', a slender, ground-covering plant, became the first vascular plant to establish itself on land.  This first colonisation occurred exclusively around the Equator on landmasses then limited to Laurasia and, in Gondwana, to Australia.  In the Late Silurian two distinctive linages, [[Zosterophyllopsida|zosterophylls]] and [[Rhyniopsida|rhyniophytes]], had colonised the tropics.  The former evolved into the [[Lycopodiopsida|lycopods]], that were to dominate the Gondwanan vegetation over a long period, whilst the latter evolved into [[Equisetum|horsetails]] and [[gymnosperm]]s.  Most of Gondwana was located far from the Equator during this period and remained a lifeless and barren landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=The Silurian revolution, p. 151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West Gondwana drifted north during the [[Devonian]] which brought Gondwana and Laurasia close together.  Global cooling contributed to the [[Late Devonian extinction]] (19% of marine families and 50% of genera went extinct) and glaciation occurred in South America.  Before Pangaea had formed terrestrial plants, such as [[pteridophyte]]s, began to diversify rapidly resulting in the colonisation of Gondwana.  The [[Baragwanathia]] Flora, found only in the [[Yea Flora Fossil Site|Yea Beds]] of Victoria, Australia, occurs in two strata separated by {{Convert|1700|m|abbr=on}} or 30&amp;nbsp;Ma; the upper assemblage is more diverse and includes Baragwanathia, the first primitive [[herbaceous]] lycopod to evolve from the zosterophylls.  During the Devonian [[Lepidodendron|giant club mosses]] replaced the Baragwanathia Flora, introducing the first trees, and by the Late Devonian this first forest was accompanied by the [[progymnosperm]]s, including the first large trees ''[[Archaeopteris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=DEVONIAN: colonising Gondwana; The Second Extinction; Global colonisation of plants, pp. 151, 153}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Late Devonian extinction probably also resulted in [[Osteolepiformes|osteolepiform]] fishes [[Evolution of tetrapods|evolving into the amphibian tetrapods]], the earliest land vertebrates, in Greenland and Russia.  The only traces of this evolution in Gondwana are amphibian footprints and a single jaw from Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=Amphibian prelude, p. 153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closure of the Rheic Ocean and the formation of Pangaea in the Carboniferous resulted in the rerouting of ocean currents which initiated an Ice House period.  As Gondwana began to rotate clockwise, Australia shifted south to more temperate latitudes.  An ice cap initially covered most of southern Africa and South America but began to spread to eventually cover most of the supercontinent, save for northern-most Africa-South America and eastern Australia.  Giant lycopod and horsetail forests continued to evolve in tropical Laurasia together with a diversified assemblage of true insects.  In Gondwana, in contrast, ice and, in Australia, volcanism decimated the Devonian flora to a low-diversity seed fern flora&amp;nbsp;– the pteridophytes were increasingly replaced by the gymnosperms which were to dominate until the Mid-Cretaceous.  Australia, however, was still located near the Equator during the Early Carboniferous and during this period [[Temnospondyli|temnospondyl]] and [[Lepospondyli|lepospondyl]] amphibians and the first [[amniote]] reptilians evolved, all closely related to the Laurasian fauna, but spreading ice eventually drove these animals away from Gondwana entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=CARBONIFEROUS: competing with ice, pp. 153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gondwana ice sheet melted and sea levels dropped during the Permian and Triassic global warming.  During this period, the extinct [[Glossopteridales|glossopterids]] colonised Gondwana and reached peak diversity in the Late Permian when coal-forming forests covered much of Gondwana.  The period also saw the evolution of [[Voltziales]]; one of the few plant orders to survive the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|end-Permian extinction]] (57% of marine families and 83% of genera went extinct) which came to dominate in the Late Permian and from whom true conifers evolved.  Tall lycopods and [[Equisetopsida|horsetails]] dominated the wetlands of Gondwana in the Early Permian.
Insects co-evolved with glossopterids across Gondwana and diversified with more than 200 species in 21 orders by the Late Permian, many known from South Africa and Australia.  Beetles and cockroaches remained minor elements in this fauna.  [[Tetrapod]] fossils from the Early Permian have only been found in Laurasia but they became common in Gondwana later during the Permian.  The arrival of the [[therapsid]]s resulted in the first plant-vertebrate-insect ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=PERMIAN: the glossopterid empire, pp. 153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern diversification===
During the Mid- to Late Triassic hot house conditions coincided with a peak in biodiversity&amp;nbsp;— the end-Permian extinction was enormous and so was the radiation that followed.  Two families of conifers, [[Podocarpaceae]] and [[Araucariaceae]], dominated Gondwana in the Early Triassic, but ''[[Dicroidium]]'', an extinct genus of fork-leaved seed ferns, dominated woodlands and forests of Gondwana during most of the Triassic.  Conifers evolved and radiated during the period with six of eight extant families already present before the end of it.  [[Bennettitales]] and [[Pentoxylales]], two now extinct orders of gymnospermous plants, evolved in the Late Triassic and became important in the Jurassic and Cretaceous.  It is possible that gymnosperm biodiversity surpassed later angiosperm biodiversity and that the evolution of angiosperms began during the Triassic but, if so, in Laurasia rather than in Gondwana.  Two Gondwanan classes, [[Lycopodiophyta|lycophytes]] and [[Equisetopsida|sphenophytes]], saw a gradual decline during the Triassic while ferns, though never dominant, managed to diversify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=TRIASSIC: the gymnosperm heyday, pp. 155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brief ice house of the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]] had a dramatic impact on dinosaurs but left plants largely unaffected.  The Jurassic was mostly a hot house and while vertebrates managed to diversify in this environment, plants have left little evidence of such development, with the exception of [[Cheirolepidiaceae|Cheiroleidiacean]] conifers and [[Caytoniales]] and other groups of seed ferns.  In terms of biomass the Jurassic flora was dominated by conifers families and other gymnosperms that had evolved during the Triassic.  The [[Pteridophyte]]s, that had dominated during the Palaeozoic, were now marginalised, except for ferns.  In contrast to Laurentia, very few insect fossils have been found in Gondwana to a large extent because of widespread deserts and volcanism.  While plants had a cosmopolitan distribution, dinosaur evolved and diversified in a pattern that reflects  the Jurassic break-up of Panagaea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=JURASSIC: volcanism, conifers and bennettitaleans, pp. 156, 158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cretaceous saw the arrival of the [[angiosperm]]s, or flowering plants, a group that probably evolved in western Gondwana (South America-Africa).  From there the angiosperms diversified in two stages: the [[Monocotyledon|monocots]] and [[magnoliids]] evolved in the Early Cretaceous followed by the [[Hamamelidaceae|hammamelid]] [[Dicotyledon|dicots]].  By the Mid-Cretaceous angiosperms constituted half of the flora in northeastern Australia.  There is, however, no obvious connection between this spectacular angiosperm radiation and an extinction event nor vertebrate/insect evolution.  Insect orders associated with pollination, such as [[beetle]]s, [[Fly|flies]], [[Lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]], and [[Hymenoptera|wasps, bees, and ants]], radiated continuously from the Permian-Triassic long before the arrival of the angiosperms. Well-preserved insect fossils have been found in the lake deposits of the [[Santana Formation]] in Brazil, the [[Koonwarra, Victoria#Koonwarra fossil bed|Koonwarra Lake fauna]] in Australia, and the [[Orapa diamond mine]] in Botswana.&lt;ref name="And-Cretaceous"&gt;{{Harvnb|Anderson|Anderson|Archangelsky|Bamford|1999|loc=CRETACEOUS: of flowers and pollination, pp. 158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dinosaurs continued to prosper but, as the angiosperm diversified, conifers, bennettitaleans and pentoxylaleans disappeared from Gondwana {{Circa}} 115&amp;nbsp;Ma together with the specialised herbivorous [[ornithischia]]ns whilst generalist browsers such as several families of [[Sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorph]] [[Saurischia]] prevailed.  The [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] killed off all dinosaurs except birds, but plant evolution in Gondwana was hardly affected by the event.&lt;ref name="And-Cretaceous" /&gt;
[[Gondwanatheria]] is an extinct group of non-[[theria]]n mammals with a Gondwanan distribution (South America, Africa, Madagascar, India, and Antarctica) during the Late Cretaceous and Palaeogene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gurovich|Beck|2009|loc=Introduction, pp. 25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Xenarthra]] and [[Afrotheria]], two placental clades, are of Gondwanan origin and probably began to evolve separately {{Circa}} {{Ma|105|Ma}} when Africa and South America separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Woodburne|Rich|Springer|2003|loc=Gondwana and early mammal evolution, p. 375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nothofagus demis.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|The plant genus ''[[Nothofagus]]'' illustrates Gondwanan distribution, having originated in the supercontinent and existing in present-day Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, and South America's [[Southern Cone]]. Fossils have also recently been found in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|HaoMin|ZheKun|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[laurel forest]] of Australia, New Caledonia, and New Zealand have a number of other related species of the [[laurissilva]] de Valdivia, through the connection of the [[Antarctic flora]] as gymnosperms and deciduous angiosperm'' Nothofagus''. ''[[Corynocarpus laevigatus]]'' is called the bay of New Zealand, ''[[Laurelia novae-zelandiae]]'' belongs to the same genus ''[[Laurelia]]''. The sempervirens [[tree]] [[niaouli]] grows in Australia, New Caledonia, and New Zealand.  New Caledonia and New Zealand ecoregions became separated from Australia by [[continental drift]] 85 million years ago. The islands still retain plants that originated in Gondwana and spread to the Southern Hemisphere continents later. However, strong evidence exists of [[glaciation]] during the [[Carboniferous]] to [[Permian]] time, especially in South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

'''Guido of Arezzo''' (also '''Guido Aretinus''', '''Guido Aretino''', '''Guido da Arezzo''', '''Guido Monaco''', '''Guido d'Arezzo''', or '''Guy of Arezzo''' also '''Guy d'Arezzo''') (991/992 – after 1033) was an Italian music theorist of the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] era. He is regarded as the inventor of modern [[musical notation#Early Europe|musical notation]] ([[Staff (music)|staff notation]]) that replaced [[neume|neumatic notation]]. His text, the ''[[Micrologus]]'', was the second most widely distributed treatise on music in the Middle Ages (after the writings of [[Boethius]]).

==Life==
Guido was a [[Benedictine]] [[monk]] from the Italian city-state of [[Arezzo]]. Recent research has dated his ''Micrologus'' to 1025 or 1026; since Guido stated in a letter that he was thirty-four when he wrote it,&lt;ref name="Stuart Lyons Do-Re-Mi"&gt;Stuart Lyons, ''Horace's Odes and the Mystery of Do-Re-Mi with Full Verse Translation of the Odes''. Oxford: Aris &amp; Phillips, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-85668-790-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; his birthdate is presumed to be around 991 or 992. His early career was spent at the [[Pomposa Abbey|monastery of Pomposa]], on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast near [[Ferrara]]. While there, he noted the difficulty that singers had in remembering [[Gregorian chant]]s.

He came up with a method for teaching the singers to learn chants in a short time, and quickly became famous throughout north Italy. However, he attracted the hostility of the other monks at the abbey, prompting him to move to Arezzo, a town which had no abbey, but which did have a large group of cathedral singers, whose training [[Tedald (Bishop of Arezzo)|Bishop Tedald]] invited him to conduct.

While at Arezzo, he developed new techniques for teaching, such as staff notation and the use of the "ut–re–mi–fa–so–la" ([[Solfège|do–re–mi–fa–so–la]]) [[mnemonic]] ([[solmization]]). The ut–re–mi-fa-so-la syllables are taken from the initial syllables of each of the first six half-lines of the first stanza of the [[hymn]] ''[[Ut queant laxis]]'', whose text is attributed to the Italian monk and scholar [[Paul the Deacon|Paulus Diaconus]] (though the musical line either shares a common ancestor with the earlier setting of [[Horace]]'s "[[:la:s:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber IV/Carmen XI|Ode to Phyllis]]" (''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]'' 4.11), recorded in the Montpellier manuscript H425, or may have been taken from it).&lt;ref name="Stuart Lyons Do-Re-Mi" /&gt;  [[Giovanni Battista Doni]] is known for having changed the name of note "Ut" (C), renaming it "Do" (in the "Do Re Mi ..." sequence known as [[solfège]]).&lt;ref name="McNaught"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A seventh note, "Si" (from the initials for "Sancte Iohannes," Latin for St. John the Baptist) was added shortly after to complete the diatonic scale.&lt;ref&gt; Norman Davies, ''Europe: A History'' (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 271–7). {{ISBN|978-0-19-520912-9}}; {{ISBN|978-0-19-820171-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In anglophone countries, "Si" was changed to "Ti" by [[Sarah Glover]] in the nineteenth century so that every syllable might [[Tonic sol-fa|begin with a different letter]] (this also freed up Si for later use as Sol-sharp). "Ti" is used in [[tonic sol-fa]] and in the song "[[Do-Re-Mi]]".

The ''Micrologus'', written at the cathedral at Arezzo and dedicated to Tedald, contains Guido's teaching method as it had developed by that time. Soon it had attracted the attention of [[Pope John XIX]], who invited Guido to Rome. Most likely he went there in 1028, but he soon returned to Arezzo, due to his poor health. It was then that he announced in a letter to Michael of Pomposa ("{{Lang|la|Epistola de ignoto cantu|italic=no}}") his discovery of the "ut–re–mi" musical mnemonic. Little is known of him after this time.

==The Guidonian hand==
Guido is credited with the invention of the [[Guidonian hand]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/11968 Claude V. Palisca and Dolores Pesce: "Guido of Arezzo [Aretinus&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;"]. ''[[Grove Music Online]]'', 11 February 2013. Accessed 11 February 2018. {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/26154 "Solmization"] by Andrew Hughes and Edith Gerson-Kiwi, ''[[Grove Music Online]]'' {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; a widely used mnemonic system where note names are mapped to parts of the human hand. However, only a rudimentary form of the Guidonian hand is actually described by Guido, and the fully elaborated system of natural, hard, and soft [[hexachord]]s cannot be securely attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Claude V. Palisca, "Theory, Theorists, §5: Early Middle Ages", ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12th century, a development in teaching and learning music in a more efficient manner had arisen. Guido of Arezzo's alleged development of the Guidonian hand, more than a hundred years after his death, allowed for musicians to label a specific joint or fingertip with the [[Gamut (music)|gamut]] (also referred to as the hexachord in the modern era).{{Citation needed|date=July 2016|reason=Bonnie Blackburn certainly does not make this outrageous claim. Who in the modern era confuses a six-note system with a twenty-note one?}} Using specific joints of the hand and fingertips transformed the way one would learn and memorize solmization syllables. Not only did the Guidonian hand become a standard use in preparing music in the 12th century, its popularity grew more widespread well into the 17th and 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie J. Blackburn, "[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/17205 Lusitano, Vicente]", Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. accessed 13 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The knowledge and use of the Guidonian hand would allow a musician to simply transpose, identify intervals, and aid in use of notation and the creation of new music. Musicians were able to sing and memorize longer sections of music and counterpoint during performances and the amount of time spent diminished dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;[[Don Michael Randel]], "Guido of Arezzo", ''The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music'' (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1996): 339–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A monument to him was erected in his native Arezzo. He is one of the famous Tuscans honored by a statue in the [[Loggiato of the Uffizi]] in Florence. 

The [[Scorewriter|computer music notation]] system [[GUIDO music notation]] is named after him and his invention.

The "International Guido d'Arezzo Polyphonic Contest" (Concorso Polifónico Guido d'Arezzo) is named after him.

[[Francisco Valls]]' controversial ''Missa Scala Aretina'' took its name from Guido Aretinus' scale.

'''Ilana Löwy''' (née '''Zelmanowicz'''), born in 1948 in [[Łódź]], [[Poland]], is a historian of biomedical sciences and a feminist. She works as a research director at an interdisciplinary and cross-institutional research unit CERMES-3 (''Centre de recherche médecine, sciences, santé, santé mentale, société'', [[Inserm]]-[[CNRS]]-[[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|EHESS]]),&lt;ref name=cermes3&gt;[http://www.cermes3.cnrs.fr/fr/membres/168-lowy-ilana Personal page] at the www.cermes3.cnrs.fr&lt;/ref&gt; and is associated with the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at [[King's College London]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/sshm/people/Visiting-Professors/ilanalowy.aspx www.kcl.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; the Department of the History of Science at [[Harvard University]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://histsci.fas.harvard.edu/people/associates histsci.fas.harvard.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oswaldo Cruz Foundation|Casa de Oswaldo Cruz]], [[Fiocruz]], Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ppghcs.coc.fiocruz.br/index.php/en/faculty ppghcs.coc.fiocruz.br]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in a Jewish family in Poland, her parents decided to leave for Israel in 1957. She gained her [[Master of Science|Msc]] in [[microbiology]] and [[biochemistry]] from [[Tel Aviv University]] in 1971, and her PhD (''Doctorat D'Etat es Sciences'') from [[Paris Diderot University|Paris VII University]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudoc.abes.fr/DB=2.1/SRCH?IKT=12&amp;TRM=160949645 sudoc.abes.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
At the beginning of her career, Ilana Löwy was a working at the [[Institut Pasteur]] at the [[immunology|Cellular immunity]] lab. Her interest for the history of science initially evolved around the history of organ transplantation, bacteriology, immunology, virology and tropical medicine. With an increasing interest for human reproduction and cancer, her works associate now an extensive analysis of biomedical analysis and a reflexion [[gender studies|on gender]]. She has extensively published on [[Ludwik Fleck]], Polish historian and [[Philosophy of medicine|philosopher of medicine]]. Her current (2017) research focuses on [[prenatal diagnosis]], [[genetics]] and [[congenital disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=cermes3 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5337">'''Inter-protocol exploitation''' is a class of [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerabilities]] that takes advantage of interactions between two communication [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngssoftware.com/research/papers/InterProtocolCommunication.pdf|title=Inter-protocol Communication|date= Aug 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example the protocols used in the [[Internet]]. It is commonly discussed in the context of the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] ([[HTTP]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remote.org/jochen/sec/hfpa/index.html|title=HTML Form Protocol Attack}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Exploit (computer security)|attack]] uses the potential of the two different protocols meaningfully communicating commands and data.

It was popularized in 2007 and publicly described in research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngssoftware.com/Libraries/Documents/03_07_Inter-Protocol_Exploitation.sflb.ashx|title=Inter-protocol Exploitation|date=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the same year. The general class of attacks that it refers to has been known since at least 1994 (see the Security Considerations section of RFC 1738).

[[Internet protocol]] implementations allow for the possibility of encapsulating [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit code]] to compromise a remote program which uses a different protocol. Inter-protocol exploitation can utilize inter-protocol communication to establish the preconditions for launching an inter-protocol exploit. For example, this process could negotiate the initial authentication communication for a vulnerability in password parsing. Inter-protocol exploitation is where one protocol attacks a service running a different protocol. This is a legacy problem because the specifications of the protocols did not take into consideration an attack of this type.

==Technical details==
The two protocols involved in the vulnerability are termed the carrier and target. The carrier [[Encapsulation (networking)|encapsulates]] the commands and/or data. The target protocol is used for communication to the intended victim service. Inter-protocol communication will be successful if the carrier [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] can encapsulate the commands and/or data sufficiently to meaningfully communicate to the target [[Service (systems architecture)|service]].

Two preconditions need to be met for successful communication across protocols: encapsulation and error tolerance. The carrier protocol must encapsulate the data and commands in a manner that the target protocol can understand. It is highly likely that the resulting [[data stream]] with induce [[parsing]] errors in the target protocol.

The target protocol be must be sufficiently [[error tolerance|forgiving of errors]]. During the inter-protocol connection it is likely that a percentage of the communication will be invalid and cause errors. To meet this precondition, the target protocol implementation must continue processing despite these errors.

==Current implications==
One of the major points of concern is the potential for this attack vector to reach through [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] and [[Demilitarized zone (computing)|DMZ]]s. Inter-protocol exploits can be transmitted over [[HTTP]] and launched from [[web browsers]] on an internal [[subnetwork|subnet]]. An important point is the web browser is not exploited through any conventional means.

==Example==
JavaScript delivered over HTTP and communicating over the IRC protocol.
&lt;source lang="javascript"&gt;
var form = document.createElement('form');
form.setAttribute('method', 'post');
form.setAttribute('action', 'http://irc.example.net:6667');
form.setAttribute('enctype', 'multipart/form-data');

var textarea = document.createElement('textarea');
textarea.innerText = "USER A B C D \nNICK turtle\nJOIN #hack\nPRIVMSG #hackers: I like turtles\n";

form.appendChild(textarea);
document.body.appendChild(form);
form.submit();
&lt;/source&gt;Known examples of the vulnerability were also demonstrated on files constructed to be valid [[HTML]] code and [[BMP file format|BMP]] image at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Marco Ramilli's Blog: Hacking through images|url = http://marcoramilli.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/hacking-through-images.html|website = marcoramilli.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Signing the document content is not enough: A new attack to digital signature|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=4664402|date = August 2008|access-date = 2015-05-13|pages = 520–525|doi = 10.1109/ICADIWT.2008.4664402|first = F.|last = Buccafurri|first2 = G.|last2 = Caminiti|first3 = G.|last3 = Lax}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.softcomputing.net/jias/buccafurri.pdf|url = http://www.softcomputing.net/jias/buccafurri.pdf|website = www.softcomputing.net|accessdate = 2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivanovka''' ({{lang-ru|Ивановка}}) is an estate near [[Tambov]], [[Russia]], which used to be the summer residence of the Russian composer [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] in the period between 1890 and 1917 (until his emigration). It was the family home of his aristocratic relatives, the Satins. Many of Rachmaninoff's earlier masterpieces [[List of compositions by Sergei Rachmaninoff|were created]] in its bucolic atmosphere. A museum commemorating the life and works of the composer was opened there in 1982.

The estate of Rachmaninoff is actually located due east of the Russian town called Mozdek, and can be found at latitude 51°57'14.24"N and longitude 42° 0'7.85"E.1  This estate is now a museum dedicated to the beloved Russian composer, whose professional life was marked with dismissive criticism,2 although his music continues to fill concert halls around the world.  Although located in the Tambov Oblast, the house of his inheritance is some 12 miles due west from Uvaravo,3 and this was likely his community. A trip to Moscow would be some 300 miles and was likely taken by Train from Tambov.4

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3196">'''Jacob Isaacson''' (May 5, 1911 – September 8, 1980) was an American [[composer]] and [[musician]].
Isaacson was most noted for his own Colortone musical notation and his early works within this system. His association with the [[Fluxus]] movement was played down by Isaacson, who held European classical tradition in high regard, although his experimental and [[minimalist]] compositions drew inevitable comparison.

==Life==
Isaacson was born on May 5, 1911 in [[Midlothian, Virginia]] to Alfred and Martha Isaacson who relocated to nearby Chesterfield four years later. Isaacson developed a keen interest in music and a   proficiency at a number of instruments. He attended [[James River High School (Chesterfield County, Virginia)|James River High School]] in Chesterfield and returned in 1937 to teach Art and Music there.&lt;br&gt;
It was at James River High that Isaacson began a study of his [[synesthesia]], a mild case of which he had correctly diagnosed, and his own emotional response to color. His private, experimental, compositions, "doodled" pieces consisting of finely inked lines on a conventional stave, took on a more powerful and expressive form and, in 1950, by now a lecturer at [[Virginia State University]], he produced the first of his "Colortone" series.&lt;br&gt;
----
Isaacson's Colortone notation, in its purest form, demanded nothing more from the musician than an emotional, response to color and shape. Ability and proficiency were secondary to sensitivity and subtlety in "reading" both the score and one's musical partners. These compositions quickly became part of his classes at Virginia State.
----
A move to [[Mannes College]], New York, in 1951 encouraged fresh creativity, and by 1958 Isaacson had produced a further 8 Colortone pieces, the first of his four "Abstractions", and "For [[Diego Rivera]]", a tribute to the Mexican artist, who had died in November the previous year. Isaacson had put aside sheet music, favoring  slides, projections and abstract painting, and would not use printed scores again until his "Chromatics No. 1" in 1965.

==List of significant works==
The "Colortone" and "Abstractions" series can be performed by as many or as few musicians as conditions for performance allow and Isaacson refused to prescribe personnel for these pieces.

*''Colortone''  series 1 to 9 (1950–1957)
*''Abstractions''  series 1 to 4 (1955–1963)
*''For Diego Rivera''  (1958)  piano, brass septet, string quartet, orchestra.
*''Chromatics''  series 1 to 4 (1965–1974)  piano, 4 brass, recorder, violin, viola, cello, contrabass, orchestra, percussion,
*''Lucent Harmonic Color''  (1975)  magnetic tape, atlas marimba, percussion

The '''John Hope Franklin Center for Interdisciplinary and International Studies''' (JHFC) is located at [[Duke University]] in the United States. It is a consortium of programs dedicated to studying and revitalizing theories of how knowledge is gained and exchanged. The more than twenty participants come from a broad range of disciplines, converging to explore intellectual, social, and political issues, including race and race relations, the legacy of the African-American Experience, equality and opportunity amongst populations, and the implications of globalization. In essence, the Center's mission is to facilitate the interactions of humanists and others involved in the social sciences in an intellectual setting amenable to diverse partnerships.&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.jhfc.duke.edu/about/jhf.php About the Center &gt;&gt; John Hope Franklin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814071316/http://www.jhfc.duke.edu/about/jhf.php |date=2007-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
The Franklin Center is named after Dr. [[John Hope Franklin]], the James B. Duke Professor Emeritus of History and former professor of Legal History at Duke. An intellectual leader and lifelong civil rights activist, his work has inspired the Center's dedication to creative sharing of ideas and methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.duke.edu/specialcollections/franklin/bio.html Biography of John Hope Franklin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

One essential aspect of the Franklin Center is its wholehearted embrace of new technologies and innovations to enhance intellectual exchange. Using resources such as multimedia and high-speed videoconferencing, the Center employs advanced technologies both as a means to share ideas and as an end, aware of the revolutionizing power of these innovations in education and society.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

On the bus line and within walking distance to other parts of Duke's campuses, the Center is easily accessible to residents from the Durham and Triangle area, who are invited to participate in and experience workshops, lectures, exhibits, and other public events. A brown-bag lunch series--"Wednesday Conversations"—invites local residents and community leaders to share insights and expertise on matters of local and universal consequence. Past speakers have included professors from universities around the country as well as people from high-ranking positions in various foundations and associations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duke.edu/web/institute/assets/pdfs/events/WedConversations.pdf Wednesday Conversations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914051118/http://www.duke.edu/web/institute/assets/pdfs/events/WedConversations.pdf |date=2006-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public legal education, sometimes called civics education, comprises a range of activities intended to build public awareness and skills related to [[law]] and the justice system. This term also refers to the fields of practice and [[wikt:study|study]] concerned with those activities, and to a social and professional [[social movement|movement]] that advocates greater societal commitment to [[education|educating]] people about the law. Anna-Marie Marshall explains that  "in order to realize their rights, people need to take the initiative to articulate them. This initiative, in turn, depends on the availability and the relevance of legal schema to people confronting problems." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Anna-Marie|title=Idle Rights: Employees’ Rights Consciousness and the Construction of Sexual Harassment Policies.|journal=Law and Society Review|date=2005|volume=39|issue=1|pages=83–124|doi=10.1111/j.0023-9216.2005.00078.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because laws exist as part of a larger organizational ecosystem in which the interests of the organization as well as those of the actors become inextricably linked to the ways in which they are enacted.
 
Distinct from the education of students in [[law school]] seeking a degree in law (which is often simply called "[[legal education]]") and the [[continuing education#Continuing education for professionals|continuing professional education]] of [[lawyer]]s and [[judge]]s (which is sometimes called "[[continuing legal education]]"), public legal education is principally aimed at people who are not lawyers, judges, or degree-seeking law students.

The term "public legal education" (PLE) is related to, and may encompass, several similar terms.&lt;ref&gt;

The term "law-related education" (LRE) usually refers to public legal education in [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools (and sometimes in [[higher education]]), as opposed to PLE for adults and outside of school.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, Wanda (2000). "Law-Related Education: Promoting Awareness, Participation, and Action", 297–98, in ''Weaving Connections: Educating for Peace, Social and Environmental Justice'' (Tara Goldstein &amp; David Selby, eds.). {{ISBN|1-894549-01-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
According to the [[American Bar Association]], Commission on Public Understanding, legal awareness is, "the ability to make critical judgments about the substance of the law, the legal process, and available legal resources and to effectively utilize the legal system and articulate strategies to improve it is legal literacy".&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

The [[Canadian Bar Association]] (1992, 23) defines legal literacy as, "the ability to understand words used in a legal context, to draw conclusions from them, and then to use those conclusions to take action."&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Good Citizens: Literacy Training in Anxious Time. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014. Project MUSE. Web. Feb. 2015. &lt;http://muse.jhu.edu/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

With little change to the Multiple Action Research Group's(MARG, an NGO working for the promotion of legal awareness) definition, legal awareness can be defined as, "critical knowledge of legal provisions and processes, coupled with the skills to use this knowledge to respect and realize rights and entitlements".&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;&lt;ref name="MARG"&gt;[http://www.ngo-marg.org/legal-awareness Multiple Action Research Group - Justice through research empowerment] (Accessed on 2 Apr 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought, philosophy, and different approaches to legal literacy==

The "continuum approach" considers legal literacy as, "a capacity spread along a continuum, with lawyers and judges at one end and relatively incapable laypersons at the other". This approach was adopted by the legal scholar White who considered legal literacy to mean, "that degree of competence in legal discourse required for meaningful and active life in our increasingly [[legal culture|legalistic and litigious culture]]".&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

Author Bilder (1999) defines legal literacy as a, "spectrum of functional skills", related to the conduct of [[litigation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (Bilder1999, 51)&lt;/ref&gt; The continuum approach explains, "a certain degree of legal literacy is required for effective participation in modern society, but it is not necessary for the average citizen to reach the professional standard of 'thinking (and writing) like a lawyer.'"&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

One of the recent approaches considers legal literacy as a metaphor. According to this view, the term is "intended to suggest some parallels between the institution of the law, and a system of language to be mastered, knowledge gained and understanding achieved".&lt;ref&gt;(Manley-Casimir, Michael E., Wanda M. Cassidy, and Suzanne de Castell 1986, 47)&lt;/ref&gt; These authors suggest that the term legal literacy can also function as a model for educators who seek to promote such literacy. Proponents of legal literacy may thus look to the teaching of language for guidance.&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

==Need and importance==
Anoop Kumar, a researcher of Legal Literacy Mission, says in his study, "the legislature of the state and the parliament, while enacting the legislation, consider the objectives of it. Some laws lay down the substantive rights of the masses and some touch upon the procedural aspect of certain laws. But it is due to lack of awareness of beneficiaries that most of the legislations are ineffective at the stage of their execution."&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Anoop, Social science research network National Legal Literacy Mission - An Evaluative Analysis {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.2240008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beljaars, Ben. "Implementing Legal Information Literacy: A Challenge for the Curriculum", International Journal of Legal Information. Journal. Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal awareness can empower people to demand justice, accountability and effective remedies at all levels.&lt;ref name=MARG/&gt; Legal needs always stand to become crisis oriented because their ignorance prevents them from anticipating legal troubles and approaching a lawyer for consultation and advice in time. This magnifies the impact of their legal troubles and difficulties when they come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hslsa.nic.in/Resume.htm Justice P.N. Bhagwati, In 1986, in case of Sukhdas V. Union Territory of Arunachal Pradesh, reported in AIR 1986 S.C. at page 991, Justice P.N. Bhagwat]&lt;/ref&gt;

Without (legal) literacy people can get intimidated and alienated from law. This may evolve into a situation which results in people coming into conflict with the law, or being unable to obtain help from it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (Canadian Bar Association 1992)]&lt;/ref&gt; Courts have acknowledged the barrier raised by a lack of literacy to asserting guaranteed rights effectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (The John Howard Society of Canada1996)]&lt;/ref&gt; Low literacy may block people’s access to justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (Council of Canadian Administrative Tribunals 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; At times, literacy requirements have been used to block access to rights and benefits&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (South Carolina v. Katzenbach (No. 22, Orig.))]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preber, B. J. Financial Expert Witness Communication: A Practical Guide to Reporting and Testimony, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. May 2014.

===Goals and objectives===
[[File:Womens read about their legal rights in a public awareness campaing (Benin) (5579786047).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Women read about their legal rights in a public awareness campaign ([[Benin]])]]

Goals of the legal literacy programs can be broadly divided in three types. Namely educational, competency and critical.&lt;ref name="www2.athabascau.ca"&gt;http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf Retrieved 31 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Reading the Legal World'', author Laird Hunter expects legal literacy to achieve:&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;Kumar, Anoop, National Legal Literacy Mission - An Evaluative Analysis (March 26, 2013). {{DOI|10.2139/ssrn.2240008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"People using the legal system must be able to guide themselves through a process that they understand [...] and, at appropriate places along the way"
*recognize they have a [[Natural and legal rights|legal right]] or [[Law of obligations|responsibility]], in order to exercise or assume it;
*recognize when a problem or conflict is a legal conflict and when a legal solution is available;
*know how to take the necessary action to avoid problems and where this is not possible, how to help themselves appropriately;
*know how and where to find information on the law, and be able to find information that is accessible to them,
* know when and how to obtain suitable legal assistance;
* have confidence that the legal system will provide a remedy, and
* understand the process clearly enough to perceive that justice has been done

Depending on the goals there can be a number of objectives for legal literacy programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawforlife.org.uk/introduction/cambodian-community-empowerment-and-legal-awareness-programme,10181,FP.html retrieved 31 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods adopted to promote legal awareness===
There have been many cases where governments have promoted long-term legal literacy missions or awareness campaigns. An example of this is when institutions arrange legal literacy events.

Legal awareness is also achieved through camps, lectures, and interactive workshops or crash programs on the essential and elementary legal laws. Among the general public, many wish to spend time listening to scholars on contemporary issues that have significant bearing on the rights and livelihood of ordinary people.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt; Other methods are road shows, radio talks, street and theatre plays, as well as the publication of relevant books, periodicals, posters, and charts that deal with particular laws, the distribution of pamphlets, brochures, and stickers, the display of paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Aid and Literacy Cell|url=http://www.symlaw.ac.in/legal-aid-and-literacy-cell.php|website=symlaw.ac.in|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrations in comics,&lt;ref name="morungexpress"&gt;{{cite news|title = Legal awareness through grassroots comics|url = http://www.morungexpress.com/local/124381.html|accessdate = 8 December 2014|publisher = morungexpress.com|date = November 11, 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141211044243/http://www.morungexpress.com/local/124381.html|archive-date = 11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other ways to ensure publicity for various [[legal mobilisation]] activities.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt;

Strategically located display boards in public places (railway stations, bus stations, market places, in front of major government offices and police stations) are also used to help government officials, police, and the public to understand the spirit of law.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt;

==Obstacles==
According to Lorenzo Cotula, laws are usually published in the official gazette, few people outside legal circles have access to [[legal information]].&lt;ref name=Cotula&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotula|first1=Lorenzo|title=Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control: Securing Local Resource Rights Within Foreign Investment Projects in Africa|date=1 Jan 2007|publisher=IIED, 2007|isbn=9781843696674|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-72KOAj92UgC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=legal%20awareness&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illiteracy,&lt;ref name="Cotula" /&gt; economic barriers,&lt;ref name="UNSG"&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Poverty/A-67-278.pdf  " Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights" page 6 from Note by the Secretary-General on Extreme poverty and human rights for UN GA 67th session A67/278 Distri:General 9 Aug 2012]  www.ohchr.org webpage retrieved 30 March 2013 16.00 IST&lt;/ref&gt; language barriers, social taboos&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=irvxAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Obstacles+in+%22legal+awareness%22&amp;dq=Obstacles+in+%22legal+awareness%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5xBXUffCA4fXrQeHhIGoAg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgo Arise: A Women's Developmental Magazine Published by Acfode, Issues 2-16 ] snippet view as seen/referred to on 30 March 2013 on Google books&lt;/ref&gt; and a lack of zeal among the legal fraternity may lead to obstacles in gaining requisite levels of legal literacy. According to Hanna Hasl-Kelchner, at times lack of zeal among lawyers make them prone to saying no and killing a deal rather than working through the issues and finding solutions that are both practical and legally sound.&lt;ref name="HannaHK"&gt;{{cite book| first = Hanna | last = Hasl-Kelchner| title = The business guide to legal literacy: what every manager should know about the law| isbn = 9780787982553 | year = 2006| pages = 1–12 &amp; inside flap page|accessdate=9 Nov 2013| url = http://www.legalliteracybooktour.com/LegalLiteracy-FreeChapters.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a note to the UN General Assembly 67th session, the UN Secretary General states, "the deprivations that persons living in poverty encounter throughout their lives — lack of access to quality education, reduced access to information, limited political voice and social capital — translate into lower levels of legal literacy and awareness of their rights, creating social obstacles to seeking redress".&lt;ref name=UNSG/&gt;

The absence of a [[legal culture]] and the resulting illiteracy are the main reasons for the large number of cases in the courts. If the accused citizen knows that an act is a crime punishable by law, they may not do it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://main.omanobserver.om/node/89239 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130413235533/http://main.omanobserver.om/node/89239 |archivedate=2013-04-13 |df= }} website retrieved 30 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the domain of law a vast category of users need to exchange [[legal information]] worldwide and carry out activities in a context where a common understanding of law beyond language is highly desirable. However, this requirement is hard to meet, due to the variety of languages and modes in which the legal discourse is expressed as well as to the diversity of legal orders and the legal concepts on which these systems are founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webfolder.eurac.edu/EURAC/LexALP_shared/media/Peruginelli.pdf Multilingual Legal Information Access: an Overview- Ginevra Peruginelli] Retrieved 30 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

About lesser significance to legal literacy in US legal education, Leonard J. Long professor of law, [[Quinnipiac University School of Law]] says, "law students, law firms, consumers of legal services, and society as a whole would benefit from having a legal profession comprised and dominated by people who are literate in American law, its history, and its jurisprudence. But legal literacy is not promoted mainly because it is not viewed as necessary for the practice of law. This is part of the anti-intellectual tradition in American law generally, and in American legal education specifically".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.siu.edu/journal/34fall/1%20-%20Long.pdf RESISTING ANTI -INTELLECTUALISM AND PROMOTING LEGAL LITERACY by Leonard J.

==Institutional and corporate legal literacy==
Corporate, institutions and NGOs are subject to and are supposed to follow various sets of laws.&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;

===Corporate legal literacy===
Legal awareness is an important part of professional work life.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=1T5BHBHNNN0C&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=%22legal+awareness%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2--T8XgEY3JrQeY-qW1DQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBTi0AQ&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Akula, when law-sensitive issues arise, corporate executives often find themselves in what is, for them, unmapped territory, often without requisite law training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iedp.com/Blog/Importance_Legal_Literacy_Executives_MITSloan The Importance of Legal Literacy for Executives-John Akula, Senior lecturer in Law at MIT Sloan School of Management] Retrieved 31 March 2013 13.00pm IST&lt;/ref&gt; When corporate executives work with attorneys they need to develop a common language to bridge probable communication gaps to achieve legal astituteness.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=I2ezeH8IpSgC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq=need+of+legal+literacy+to+corporate+executives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qO9XUcrEJ4OsrAeM5YGgCQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=need%20of%20legal%20literacy%20to%20corporate%20executives&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hanna Hasl-Kelchner, legal literacy can help to bridge the gap between law and business by simplifying legal terms into language that makes business sense and offers a new way to think about the law as a useful business tool.&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;
She says, "corporate legal literacy involves balanced understanding of cross disciplinary influences bringing in legal risk exposure, avoiding lawsuits and transforming potential business legal issues that threaten growth and profitability, into opportunities for building stronger business relationships, delivering sustainable stakeholder value, improving competitive advantage and foremost embedding compliance into the corporate culture to achieve organizational excellence".&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;

According to Hasl-Kelchner, corporate legal literacy tackles companies' legal risk profiles on both the employee and organizational levels. There is a need to identify the infrastructure needed to support legal literacy and promote effective communications throughout the organization.&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;

===Institutional legal literacy===
George Pulikuthiyil, executive director of NGO Jananeethi in his essay ''Legal Literacy for Social Empowerment'' says that, 'Well educated and highly placed professionals too are often not aware of provisions in laws and implications of their violations. Many would not know the nitty-gritty of several statutory laws and their applications.&amp;nbsp;... However, the fact remains that vast majority of the officers and professionals like clinical psychologists, therapeutic counsellors, welfare officers, social workers, institutional heads and academia are ignorant of their role and responsibilities as contemplated in the Act. NGOs do take pains to organize workshops to sensitize them with respect to such new generation legislations wherein the pro-active role of various stake holders are great significance.' &lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pulikuthiyil|first1=George|title=Legal Literacy for Social Empowerment|url=http://www.jananeethi.org/jananeethi/reports/esseylegalliteracy.htm|publisher=jananeethi.org/|accessdate=2 December 2014|quote=Bare-foot lawyers/para-legal activists"There may be para-legal workers specially trained in specific thrust areas like minorities, indigenous people, child rights, gender issues, right to information, consumer rights, torture and custodial violence etc. "}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Pulikuthiyil further believes non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations, faith groups, various service providers, trade unions, youth clubs, police personnel, elected representatives to local bodies, PG students of social work and service organizations also have larger scope of improving the quality of life provided they are made conversant with respective legislations.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt;

===Designated legal officers===
Apart from external legal advisors, [[General counsel|internal legal officers]]&lt;ref name="ACC"&gt;The 2011 In-House Counsel Compensation Survey, Question 10,[http://www.acc.com/chapters/socal/upload/2011-In-House-Counsel-Compensation-Survey_4-13-11.pdf] Profiles of In-House Counsel 2006 [http://www.acc.com/vl/public/Surveys/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;amp;pageid=16297] Who Does Your Counsel Report To? (2001) (The Majority Report to the CEO)[http://www.acc.com/legalresources/resource.cfm?show=145939]&lt;/ref&gt;  and in certain countries like Australia and India, The [[company secretary]] is responsible for advising on good governance practices and compliance of corporate governance norms as prescribed under various corporate, securities and other business laws, regulations and guidelines made thereunder.&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;[http://www.companysecretary.com.au/articles/WhatIsCS.pdf What is a Company Secretary?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=csindia&gt;[http://www.icsi.edu/Student/ROLEOFCOMPANYSECRETARY.aspx ROLE OF COMPANY SECRETARY]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
There are certain related concepts including [[legal consciousness]], [[legal mobilization]] and [[legal socialization]], [[Empowerment#Legal empowerment|legal empowerment]], that helps to put legal literacy in perspective.&lt;ref name="www2.athabascau.ca"/&gt;

===Civics and socio-legal literacy===
Despite semantic proximity education of [[civics]], civics literacy and legal literacy are not exactly the same. In the "legal literacy" semantic components are the dominant notion of the "right," "law," "responsibility to the law," and "civic literacy" added to them the concept of "civil society", "individual rights and freedoms" and "man's responsibility to civil society".&lt;ref&gt;http://academia.lndb.lv/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1173/natalia-gendina-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the formal civic education system, human rights can be taken up as a part of civic education, values education and social studies, though they may have the limitation of presenting only certain aspects of human rights rather than their integrated whole, and duties of citizens may be overly emphasized to the detriment of certain rights and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hurights.or.jp/english/education/overview-human-rights-education-in-the-asia-pacific.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At the elementary school level, usually minimal level legal literacy introduction is taught through [[civics]], but which is not necessarily adequate for the rest of life.&lt;ref name="Civic Education, Crittenden &amp; Levine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crittenden|first1=Jack|last2=Levine|first2=Peter|title=Civic Education|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/civic-education/|website=plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=22 June 2017|page=Para 2 and also para 1|date=27 December 2007&lt;!--substantive revision Thu May 30, 2013--&gt;|quote=Paragraph no. 2  Nevertheless, most scholarship that uses the phrase “civic education” investigates deliberate programs of instruction within schools or colleges,...........Nevertheless, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that civic education takes place at all stages of life and in many venues other than schools.  also Para 1  ...It is certainly not limited to schooling and the education of children and youth.

==Internet and legal literacy==
The Internet as a [[legal research|legal research tool]] is advantageous for most primary legal research materials, which can be located for free to supplement fee-based services and library collections. The Internet offers increased access to resources, low- or no-cost access, and real-time information via social media.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aallnet.org/main-menu/Publications/products/Law-Librarians-Making-Information-Work/pll-guide-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, MARG(Multiple Action Research Group), an organization working for [[empowerment#Legal|empowerment]] is using internet and social networking sites to empower netizens. The organization posts  every Friday "friday facts" in their [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] &amp; [[Instagram]] pages.These posts/pictures focuses on rights of the citizens and all other important information about laws in India.

==Important institutions promoting legal awareness and legal literacy==
[[Bar council]]s, lawyer federations and various NGOs take the lead in promoting legal awareness and legal literacy. In India, as per the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, the [[National Legal Services Authority]] (NLSA) has been designated to take appropriate measures for spreading legal literacy and legal awareness amongst the people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nalsa.gov.in/actrules.html The act as seen on 26 Feb 2013 14.30 GMT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729091927/http://nalsa.gov.in/actrules.html |date=2016-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indiana]], in the United States, Outreach for Legal Literacy (OLL) is a community service program in which law students teach law to fifth-graders in local elementary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.indiana.edu/students/activities/outreach/index.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328142637/http://law.indiana.edu/students/activities/outreach/index.shtml |archivedate=2013-03-28 |df= }} Retrieved 31 March 2013 14.00pm IST&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Central Europe|Altitudinal zonation}}

'''Central Europe''' contains several '''life zones''', depending on location and elevation.

Geographically, Central Europe lies between the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Apennine peninsula|Apennine]] and [[Balkan peninsula]]s. It includes the plains of [[Germany]] and [[Poland]]; the [[Alps]]; and the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The Central European Flora region stretches from Central [[France]]  to Central [[Romania]]  and Southern [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Wolfgang|last1=Frey|author1-link=:de:Wolfgang Frey|first2=Rainer|last2=Lösch|author2-link=:de:Rainer Lösch|title=Lehrbuch der Geobotanik|chapter=Pflanze und Vegetation in Raum und Zeit|publisher=Spektrum Akademischer Verlag|location=München|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowlands of Central Europe contain the [[Central European mixed forests]] ecoregion,&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0412|name=Central European mixed forests}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the mountains host the [[Alps conifer and mixed forests]]&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0501|name=Alps conifer and mixed forests}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Carpathian montane conifer forests]] ecoregions.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0504|name=Carpathian montane conifer forests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important factor in the local climate and ecology of Central Europe is the elevation: an increase of elevation by {{convert|1000|m|ft}} causes the average air temperature to drop by {{convert|5|C|F}} and decreases the amount of water that can be held by the atmosphere by 30%. This decrease in temperature and increase in rainfall result in altitudinal zonation, where the land can be divided into [[life zones]] of similar climate and ecology, depending on elevation.

In [[theoretical physics]], an '''M2-brane''', is a spatially extended mathematical object ([[brane]]) that appears in [[string theory]] and in related theories (e.g. [[M-theory]], [[F-theory]]). In particular, it is a solution of eleven-dimensional [[supergravity]] which possesses a three-dimensional [[World line|world volume]].

==Description==
The M2-brane solution can be found&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9803116 K. Stelle, "BPS Branes in Supergravity"]&lt;/ref&gt; by requiring &lt;math&gt;(Poincare)_{3}\times SO(8)&lt;/math&gt; symmetry of the solution and solving the supergravity equations of motion with the [[p-brane]] ansatz. The solution is given by a [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] and three-[[Differential form|form]] gauge field which, in isotropic coordinates, can be written as 
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} ds^{2}_{M2} &amp;= \left(1+\frac{q}{r^{6}}\right)^{-\frac{2}{3}}dx^{\mu} dx^{\nu}\eta_{\mu\nu} + \left(1+\frac{q}{r^{6}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}dx^{i}dx^{j}\delta_{ij} \\
F_{i\mu_{1}\mu_{2}\mu_{3}} &amp;= \epsilon_{\mu_{1}\mu_{2}\mu_{3}} \partial_{i}\left(1+\frac{q}{r^6}\right)^{-1}, \quad \mu=1,\ldots ,3 \quad i=4,\ldots , 11,\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Minkowski space|flat-space]] metric and the distinction has been made between world volume &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; and transverse &lt;math&gt;x^i&lt;/math&gt; coordinates. The constant &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the [[Noether's theorem|charge]] of the brane which is given by the integral of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; over the boundary of the transverse space of the brane.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0509137 A. Miemiec, I. Schnakenburg "Basics of M-theory"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In both [[formal logic|formal]] and [[informal logic|informal]] logic, a '''main contention''' or '''conclusion''' is a thought which can be either true or false and is usually the most controversial proposition being argued for.{{clarify|In formal logic, there is no notion of 'controversial'.|date=November 2017}} In reasoning, a main contention is represented by the top of an [[argument map]], with all supporting and objecting premises which bear upon it placed underneath.

In the context of argumentative text, it is the point that the author wants to convince you to believe - the culmination of all their reasoning. The main contention provides an answer to the following types of questions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reasoninglab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rationaleonline.com-Identifying-Contentions.pdf |format=PDF |title=Topic 11 : Identifying Contentions |website=Reasoninglab.com |accessdate=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2838">'''Description'''
&lt;br&gt;
The Master of Arts in Theological Studies (MATS) satisfies a variety of broad academic and [[vocational]] purposes. It can be suited to the [[pastor]], [[layman]] or beginning academic as an entry level Master's Degree in [[theology]]. It is often geared toward individuals seeking an introductory [[graduate degree]] in religion for service in a supportive role in their local [[Local church|congregation]]. Depending upon the school, the program can vary from as little as 36 [[semester]]/54 quarter hours up to 48 [[semester]]/72 quarter hours typically. It may or may not include a [[thesis]], [http://edglossary.org/capstone-project/ capstone] or summation. Frequently, it is a classwork only degree.

'''Programs of Study'''
&lt;br&gt;
The degree may take several differing forms such as:
M.A.T.S. (General [[theology]] degree non-specified)
[[Biblical Studies]]
[[Systematic Theology]]
[[Old Testament]]
[[New Testament]]
[[Historical Theology]]
[[Christian Apologetics]]

'''[[Accreditation]]'''
&lt;br&gt;
The Master of Arts in Theological Studies is a degree recognized by [http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg6.html accrediting agencies] such as the [[Association of Theological Schools|ATS]] ([[Association of Theological Schools]]), [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools|TRACS]] ([[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools|the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]]), the [[Association for Biblical Higher Education|ABHE]] ([[Association for Biblical Higher Education]]) and other accrediting bodies. It is classified as a Category D: Basic Program Oriented Toward General Theological Studies&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.ats.edu/uploads/accrediting/documents/accrediting-standards-architecture.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada|ATS]] ([[Association of Theological Schools]]).

'''Degree Status'''
&lt;br&gt;
While requiring only about 1/2 to 2/3 of the credit hours that are required of a [[Master of Divinity|M.Div]] ([[Master of Divinity]]), it is generally considered equal as a prerequisite for entering advanced degree programs such as for an [[Master of Sacred Theology|STM]] ([[Master of Sacred Theology]]) or [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral studies]]. However, the student will likely be required to know (or learn remedially) [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew]], [[Latin]], [[German language|German]] or another [[modern language]] in order to enter an advanced degree program if they haven't learned these yet.

==Public health initiatives for humans==
At the 1990 [[World Summit for Children]], the gathered nations identified deficiencies in two microminerals and one micronutrient – iodine, iron, and [[Vitamin A deficiency|vitamin A]] – as being particularly common and posing public health risks in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, The State of the World’s Children 1998: Fact Sheet. http://www.unicef.org/sowc98/fs03.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Summit set goals for elimination of these deficiencies. The Ottawa-based [[Micronutrient Initiative]] was formed in response to this challenge with the mission to undertake research and fund and implement micronutrient programming.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF Canada, Global Child Survival and Health: A 50-year progress report from UNICEF Canada, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

As programming around these micronutrients grew, new research in the 1990s led to the implementation of [[Folic acid|folate]] and zinc supplementation programmes as well.

Priority programs include supplementation with vitamin A for children 6–59 months, zinc supplementation as a treatment for diarrhoeal disease, iron and folate supplementation for women of child-bearing age, [[salt iodization]], [[staple food]] fortification, multiple micronutrient powders, biofortification of crops and behaviour-centred nutrition education.

===Salt iodization===
[[Salt iodization]] is the recommended strategy for ensuring adequate human iodine intake. To iodize salt, [[potassium iodate]] is added to salt after it is refined and dried and before it is packed. Although large-scale iodization is most efficient, given the proliferation of small scale salt producers in developing countries, technology for small-scale iodization has also been developed. International organizations work with national governments to identify and support small salt producers in adopting iodization activity.

In 1990, less than 20 percent of households in developing countries were consuming iodized salt.&lt;ref name="FlourFortification"&gt;Flour Fortification Initiative, GAIN, Micronutrient Initiative, USAID, The [[World Bank]], UNICEF, Investing in the future: a united call to action on vitamin and mineral deficiencies, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1994, international partnerships had formed in a global campaign for Universal Salt Iodization. By 2008, it was estimated that 72 per cent of households in developing countries were consuming iodized salt&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, The State of the World’s Children 2010, Statistical Tables, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and the number of countries in which iodine deficiency disorders were a public health concern reduced by more than half from 110 to 47 countries.&lt;ref name="FlourFortification" /&gt;

===Vitamin A supplementation===
In 1997, national [[vitamin A]] supplementation programming received a boost when experts met to discuss rapid scale-up of supplementation activity and the Micronutrient Initiative, with support from the Government of Canada, began to ensure [[vitamin A]] supply to [[UNICEF]].&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, Vitamin A Supplementation: a decade of progress, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas with [[vitamin A]] deficiency, it is recommended that children aged 6–59 months receive two doses annually. In many countries, [[vitamin A]] supplementation is combined with immunization and campaign-style health events.

Global [[vitamin A]] supplementation efforts have targeted 103 priority countries. In 1999, 16 per cent of children in these countries received two annual doses of [[vitamin A]]. By 2007, the rate increased to 62 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;Flour Fortification Initiative, GAIN, Micronutrient Initiative, [[USAID]], The World Bank, UNICEF, Investing in the future: a united call to action on vitamin and mineral deficiencies, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Micronutrient Initiative, with funding from the Government of Canada, supplies 75 per cent of the [[vitamin A]] required for supplementation in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Micronutrient Initiative, Annual Report 2009-2010, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double-fortified salt===
Double-fortified salt (DFS) is a public health tool for delivering nutritional iron. DFS is fortified with both iodine and iron. It was developed by Venkatesh Mannar, Executive Director of the [[Micronutrient Initiative]] and [[University of Toronto]] Professor Levente Diosady, who discovered a process for coating iron particles with a vegetable fat to prevent the negative interaction of iodine and iron.&lt;ref&gt;L.L. Diosady and M.G. Venkatesh Mannar, Double Fortification Of Salt With Iron And Iodine, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, Tata Salt Plus, priced at an economical rate of Rs 20 per kg, is an iodine plus iron fortified salt, developed by the [[National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad]] through double fortification technology. This technology was offered to [[Tata Chemicals]] under a long-term [[Memorandum of understanding|MoU]] after due studies on bio-availability across the population strata conducted and published by NIN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tata.com/media/releases/inside.aspx?artid=rBRDxbNl5eM= Tata group | Tata Chemicals | Media releases | India’s first iodine plus iron fortified salt launched by Tata Chemicals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first used in public programming in 2004. In September 2010 DFS was produced in the Indian State of [[Tamil Nadu]] and distributed through a state school feeding program. DFS has also been used to combat Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA) in the Indian state of [[Bihar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/evaluating-impact-anemia-making-double-fortified-salt-available-bihar-india Evaluating the Impact on Anemia of Making Double Fortified Salt Available in Bihar, India | The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, Venkatesh Mannar was named a Laureat of the California-based Tech Awards for his work in developing Double-Fortified Salt.

===Micro-enriched fertilization===
The returns of applying micronutrient-enriched fertilizers could be huge for human health, social and economic development. Research has shown that enriching fertilizers with micronutrients had not only an impact on plant deficiencies but also on humans and animals, through the food chain. A 1994 report by the World Bank estimated that micronutrient malnutrition costs developing economies at least 5 percent of gross domestic product.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank (1994). ''Enriching Lives: Overcoming Vitamin and Mineral Malnutrition in Developing Countries''. Development in Practice Series.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Asian Development Bank]] has summarized the benefits of eliminating [[micronutrient deficiencies]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Along with a growing understanding of the extent and impact of micronutrient malnutrition, several interventions have demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of correction and prevention. Distributing inexpensive capsules, diversifying to include more micronutrient-rich foods, or fortifying commonly consumed foods can make an enormous difference. Correcting iodine, vitamin A, and iron deficiencies can improve the population-wide intelligence quotient by 10-15 points, reduce maternal deaths by one fourth, decrease infant and child mortality by 40 percent, and increase people’s work capacity by almost half. The elimination of these deficiencies will reduce health care and education costs, improve work capacity and productivity, and accelerate equitable economic
growth and national development. Improved nutrition is essential to sustained economic growth. Micronutrient deficiency elimination is as cost effective as the best public health interventions and fortification is the most cost-effective strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Development Bank (October 2000). [www.adb.org/Documents/TARs/REG/tar_oth34014.pdf Regional Initiative to Eliminate Micronutrient Malnutrition in Asia Through Public-Private Partnership]. TAR: OTH 34014. Retrieved on: 2011-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Addressing zinc deficiencies through zinc fertilization===
Experiments show that soil and [[Foliar feeding|foliar]] application of zinc fertilizer can effectively reduce the [[Phytic acid#Food science|phytate]] zinc ratio in grain. People who eat bread prepared from zinc enriched wheat show a significant increase in serum zinc, suggesting that the zinc fertilizer strategy is a promising approach to address [[Zinc deficiency|zinc deficiencies]] in humans.

Where [[Zinc deficiency (plant disorder)|zinc deficiency]] is a [[limiting factor]], zinc fertilization can increase crop yields. Balanced crop nutrition supplying all essential nutrients, including zinc, is a cost effective management strategy. Even with zinc-efficient varieties, zinc fertilizers are needed when the available zinc in the topsoil becomes depleted.

==Micronutrients for plants==
{{Main|Plant nutrition}}
There are about seven nutrients essential to plant growth and health that are only needed in very small quantities. Though these are present in only small quantities, they are all necessary:

*[[Boron]] is believed to be involved in carbohydrate transport in plants; it also assists in metabolic regulation. Boron deficiency will often result in bud dieback.
*[[Chlorine]] is necessary for [[osmosis]] and ionic balance; it also plays a role in [[photosynthesis]].
*[[Copper]] is a component of some enzymes. Symptoms of copper deficiency include browning of leaf tips and chlorosis.
*[[Iron]] is essential for chlorophyll synthesis, which is why an iron deficiency results in [[chlorosis]].
*[[Manganese]] activates some important enzymes involved in [[chlorophyll]] formation. Manganese deficient plants will develop [[chlorosis]] between the veins of its leaves. The availability of manganese is partially dependent on soil pH.
*[[Molybdenum]] is essential to plant health. Molybdenum is used by plants to reduce nitrates into usable forms. Some plants use it for nitrogen fixation, thus it may need to be added to some soils before seeding legumes.
*[[Zinc]]  participates in chlorophyll formation, and also activates many enzymes. Symptoms of [[Zinc deficiency (plant disorder)|zinc deficiency]] include chlorosis and stunted growth.

===Crop biofortification===
[[Micronutrient deficiencies]] are widespread.&lt;ref name=anyas17/&gt; 51% of world cereal soils are deficient in [[zinc]] and 30% of cultivated soils globally are deficient in [[iron]]. Steady growth of crop yields during recent decades (in particular through the [[Green Revolution]]) compounded the problem by progressively depleting soil micronutrient pools.

In general, farmers only apply micronutrients when crops show deficiency symptoms, while micronutrient deficiencies decrease yields before symptoms appear. Some common farming practices (such as liming acid soils) contribute to widespread occurrence of micronutrient deficiencies in crops by decreasing the availability of the micronutrients present in the soil. 

[[Biofortification]] of crop plants &amp;ndash; improvement of vitamin and mineral levels through [[plant biotechnology]] &amp;ndash; is being used in many world regions to address micronutrient deficiencies in regions of poverty and malnutrition.&lt;ref name=anyas17/&gt;

The '''Piganino''', a [[portmanteau]] of ''pig'' and piano, is a conjectural [[musical instrument]] using a [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] as to produce [[pitch (music)|sound]] from [[pig]]s by poking them. Satirical use includes further portmanteaus as in {{lang-de|Schweineorgel}} (pig organ), {{lang-fr|l’orgue à cochons}}, and "Hog [[Harmonium]]", (a play on "[[Steinway &amp; Sons|Steinway]]") "Swineway", or (a play on "[[pianoforte]]") "Porko Forte"  in English.

{{Quote|That brutal monarch, Louis XI of France, is said to have constructed, with the assistance of the Abbé de Baigne, an instrument designated a "pig organ," for the production of natural sounds. The master of the royal music, having made a very large and varied assortment of swine, embracing specimens of all breeds and ages, these were carefully ''voiced'', and placed in order, according to their several tones and semitones, and so arranged that a key-board communicated with them, severally and individually, by means of rods ending in sharp spikes. In this way a player, by touching any note, could instantly sound a corresponding note in nature, and was enabled to produce at will either natural melody or harmony! The result is said to have been striking, but not very grateful to human ears.&lt;ref name="Vocal"&gt;Crofts 1885, cf. also Quignard 1996. Cited in Bhagwati, Sandeep (2013).

== Striped pigs in the US ==

The American [[quickstep]] song ''La Piganino'' mocked Italian influences on amateur music and popular culture in the 19th-century US. Beside lack of taste and vocal variety, the tendency to Italianize the names of all things chic and musical was lampooned.&lt;ref&gt;David Tatham: ''The Lure of the Striped Pig: The Illustration of Popular Music in America, 1820–1870.'' Imprint Society, Barre (MS) 1973, {{ISBN|0-87636-051-7}}, S. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon anticipates the surrealistic machinery of [[Rube Goldberg]]. The 19th century played on various allegations, besides Piganino, further nicknames used for the fictitious instrument were "Hog Harmonium", "Swineway" or "Porko Forte".&lt;ref name="cri"&gt;Mary Babson Fuhrer: ''A Crisis of Community: The Trials and Transformation of a New England Town, 1815–1848.'' The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill 2014, {{ISBN|978-1-4696-1550-9}}, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Just as understatement of the ludicrous is a standard mode of caricature, so too is overstatement, as we see in this happy example. Burlesquing genteel taste, amateur vocalists, and the vogue for Italianizing the names of all things with musical associations, this cartoon also anticipates the ingenious and surrealistic machines of Rube Goldberg. We may suppose that in more than a few parlors "La Piganino" was slipped onto the music rack as a hint to the vocalist when the evening reached that point at which guests' ears began to droop.&lt;ref&gt;David, Tatham (1973). Quoted at "[http://www.porkopolis.org/pig_artist/piganino/ The Piganino]", ''Porkopolis.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The background was a [[commons]]-related conflict: poor farmers tended to let their pigs roam freely, feeding on what the rich did not use, whereas the rich preferred towns and property to be tidily divided.&lt;ref name="cri"/&gt;  The striped pig was used to represent such untidiness in general and drinking men specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachushistory.org/second-great-awakening-age-reform/resources/death-striped-pig|title=Death on the Striped Pig|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piganino and related cartoons insofar referred to uppity and wannabee neighbors and their porcine conflicts with others.&lt;ref name="cri"/&gt;  In parallel, the ''[[Schweinfurt]]er Anzeiger'' as of 1873 had renewed interest on the French historical origin of the Schweineorgel.&lt;ref&gt;Zwei seltsame Instrumente, Franconia: Unterhaltungsblatt zum "Schweinfurter Anzeiger". Reichardt, 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Le Libertin'' ==
In the film ''[[The Libertine (2000 film)|Le Libertin]]'' (2000), the philosopher [[Denis Diderot]] is depicted as a screwball eccentric, trying to have his forbidden ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' printed under the eyes of Catholic fanatics. The film is staged in the chateau of a crazy Baron, loosely based on the [[Baron d'Holbach]]. In reality, the Baron d'Holbach was a devoted atheist and important sponsor and contributor to the Encyclopédie. The film shows him as an adversary of Diderot and inventor of a large variety of funny machinery. The noise of a Piganino, one of the inventions, is being used to hide the printing of the forbidden encyclopaedia in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Biographische Fiktionen: das Paradigma Denis Diderot im interkulturellen Vergleich (1765 - 2005), Heidi Denzel de Tirado Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further use ==
In German, ''Schweineorgel'' has also been used as a nickname for the [[accordion]] or [[harmonium]], as those instruments were deemed rural and not appropriate for music on academic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horniger.de/schweineorgel/texte/wasist_d.html|title=Was ist eine SCHWEINEORGEL ?|author=Rainer Siebert|date=1 July 2002|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Das Akkordeon: Schweineorgel oder Avantgarde Instrument? Christina Appert Kantonsschule Wil, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s [[cat organ|Katzenklavier]] uses a similar concept with cats. This sort of caricature was often used when new music styles came around or were adopted in musical realms that had not dealt with them previously. The [[cat organ]], a similar instrument using cats, is used in stories which criticize the cruelty of royalty.

[[Monty Python]]'s "Musical Mice" uses mice instead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9nGyPz9uT0 Monty Python - mouse organ sketch] (YouTube). ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'', "Arthur Ewing and His Musical Mice," Season One, Episode Two.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Piquerism''' (from the French ''piquer'' - "to prick") is a sexual interest in penetrating the skin of another person with sharp objects (such as pins, razors, knives, etc). Sometimes, this is serious enough to cause extreme injuries or even death.&lt;ref name = Davis&gt;{{cite book | last = Davis | first = MS | title = The concise dictionary of crime and justice | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7619-2176-1 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=SJDW9iDS_a0C&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 196] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Piquerism is a [[paraphilia]] as well as a form of [[Sadism &amp; Masochism|sadism]]. The most frequently targeted areas of the body are the breasts, buttocks, or groin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-excess/201501/life-knife-edge|title=Life On A Knife Edge|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Andrei Chikatilo===
Soviet serial killer [[Andrei Chikatilo]] was [[impotent]] and could only achieve sexual arousal through stabbing and cutting people with a knife.

===Jack the Ripper===
Dr. [[Robert D. Keppel]] and his colleagues concluded in an analysis of [[London]]'s [[Jack the Ripper]] murders of 1888 that "the injuries sustained by the victims displayed the signature characteristic of picquerism."

===Albert Fish===
[[Image:Pelvis of Albert Fish (X-ray).jpg|right|thumb|[[X-Ray]] of pelvis of [[Albert Fish]] showing over a dozen needles inserted.]]
Notorious [[serial killer]] [[Albert Fish]] has been said to have engaged in piquerism upon his victims and his own body, [[flagellation|flagellating]] himself constantly with a nail-studded board. After his arrest and subsequent jailing for the murder of Grace Budd, an [[X-Ray]] revealed at least 29 [[Sewing needle|needles]] that were inserted into his groin and pelvic region.

[[Image:Taxus wood.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The tiny centre dark spot (about 1 mm diameter) in this [[Taxaceae|yew]] [[wood]] is the pith]]
'''Pith''', or '''medulla''', is a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] in the [[Plant stem|stem]]s of [[vascular plant]]s. Pith is composed of soft, spongy [[ground tissue#Parenchyma|parenchyma]] cells, which store and transport nutrients throughout the plant. In [[eudicotyledon]]s, pith is located in the center of the stem. In [[monocotyledon]]s, it extends also into flowering stems and roots. The pith is encircled by a ring of [[xylem]]; the xylem, in turn, is encircled by a ring of [[phloem]].

While new pith growth is usually white or pale in colour, as the tissue ages it commonly darkens to a deeper brown color. In [[tree]]s pith is generally present in young growth, but in the trunk and older branches the pith often gets replaced - in great part - by xylem. In some plants, the pith in the middle of the stem may dry out and disintegrate, resulting in a hollow stem. A few plants, such as [[walnut]]s, have distinctive chambered pith with numerous short cavities (See image at middle right). The cells in the peripheral parts of the pith may, in some plants, develop to be different from cells in the rest of the pith. This layer of cells is then called ''the perimedullary region of the pithamus''. An example of this can be observed in ''Hedera helix'', a species of [[ivy]].

The term pith is also used to refer to the pale, spongy inner layer of the rind, more properly called [[mesocarp]] or albedo, of [[citrus]] fruits (such as oranges) and other [[hesperidium|hesperidia]]. The word comes from the [[Old English]] word ''piþa'', meaning substance, akin to [[Middle Dutch]] ''pitt'', meaning the pit of a fruit.&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pith |title=Pith |publisher=Random House, Inc |work=Dictionary.com Unabridged |accessdate=20 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pith of the [[Aeschynomene aspera|sola]] or other similar plants is used to make the [[pith helmet]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pith_helmet AskOxford.com - Pith helmet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The pith of the [[sago]] palm, although highly toxic to animals in its raw form, is an important human food source in [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]] by virtue of its starch content and its availability. There is a simple process of starch extraction from sago pith that leaches away a sufficient amount of the toxins and thus only the starch component is consumed. Current processes for starch extraction are generally only about 50% efficient, however, with the other half remaining in residual pith waste.&lt;ref name=Mishima&gt;{{cite web |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-5269-9_23 | author=Mishima, Takashi|title=New Sago Palm Starch Resources and Starch Pith Waste Properties |work=Sago Palm |accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form of the starch after processing is similar to [[tapioca]].

A '''project manager''' is a professional in the field of [[project management]]. Project managers have the responsibility of the planning, [[procurement]] and execution of a [[project]], in any undertaking that has a defined scope, defined start and a defined finish; regardless of industry. Project managers are first point of contact for any issues or discrepancies arising from within the heads of various departments in an organization before the problem escalates to higher authorities. Project management is the responsibility of a project manager. This individual seldom participates directly in the activities that produce the end result, but rather strives to maintain the progress, mutual interaction and [[task (project management)|tasks]] of various parties in such a way that reduces the risk of overall failure, maximizes benefits, and minimizes costs.

== Overview ==
A project manager is the person responsible for accomplishing the project objectives. Key project management responsibilities include 
* defining and communicating project objectives that are clear, useful and attainable
* procuring the project requirements like workforce, required information, various agreements and material or technology needed to accomplish project objectives
* managing the constraints of the [[project management triangle]], which are ''cost'', ''time'', [[scope (project management)|''scope'']] and quality
A project manager is a client representative and has to determine and implement the exact needs of the client, based on knowledge of the organization they are representing. An expertise is required in the domain the Project Managers are working to efficiently handle all the aspects of the project. The ability to adapt to the various internal procedures of the client and to form close links with the nominated representatives, is essential in ensuring that the key issues of cost, time, quality and above all, client satisfaction, can be realized.

* [[Resource (project management)|resource]] [[Estimation (project management)|estimate]]
* timescale
* Investment, corporate agreement and funding
* Implementation of [[Project management plan|management plan]] on to the project
* team building and motivation
* risk assessments and change in the project
* maintain sustaining project
* monitoring
* [[stakeholder management]]
* provider management
* closing the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apm.org.uk/WhatIsPM|title=What is project management?|author=|date=|website=www.apm.org.uk|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;
;Project Tools
:The tools, knowledge and techniques for managing projects are often unique to Project Management.  For example: [[work breakdown structure]]s, [[critical path analysis]] and [[earned value management]]. Understanding and applying the tools and techniques which are generally recognized as good practices are not sufficient alone for effective project management. Effective project management requires that the project manager understands and uses the knowledge and skills from at least four areas of expertise. Examples are [[PMBOK]], Application Area Knowledge: standards and regulations set forth by ISO for project management, General Management Skills and Project Environment Management&lt;ref&gt;PMBOK Guide Third Edition 2004 p.12&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many options for project management software to assist in executing projects for the project manager and his/her team.

;Project Teams
:When recruiting and building an effective team, the manager must consider not only the technical skills of each person, but also the critical roles and chemistry between workers. A [[project team]] has mainly three separate components: Project Manager, Core Team and Contracted Team.

;Risk
:Most of the project management issues that influence a project arise from [[risk]], which in turn arises from uncertainty.  The successful project manager focuses on this as his/her main concern and attempts to reduce risk significantly, often by adhering to a policy of open communication, ensuring that project participants can voice their opinions and concerns.

== Types of Project Managers ==

=== Construction Project Manager ===
Until recently, the American construction industry lacked any level of standardization, with individual States determining the eligibility requirements within their jurisdiction. However, several [[Trade associations]] based in the [[United States]] have made strides in creating a commonly accepted set of qualifications and tests to determine a project manager's competency.
* The [[Construction Management Association of America]] (CMAA) maintains the Certified Construction Manager (CCM) designation. The purpose of the CCM is to standardize the education, experience and professional understanding needed to practice construction management at the highest level.
* The Project Management Institute has made some headway into being a standardizing body with its creation of the [[Project Management Professional]] (PMP) designation.
* The Constructor Certification Commission of the [[American Institute of Constructors]] holds semiannual nationwide tests. Eight American Construction Management programs require that students take these exams before they may receive their [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[Construction Management]] degree, and 15 other Universities actively encourage their students to consider the exams.
* The Associated Colleges of Construction Education, and the Associated Schools of Construction have made considerable progress in developing national standards for construction education programs.
The profession has recently grown to accommodate several dozen [[Construction Management]] [[Bachelor of Science]] programs.
Many universities have also begun offering a master's degree in Project Management.  These programs generally are tailored to working professionals who have project management experience or project related experience; they provide a more intense and in depth education surrounding the knowledge areas within the project management body of knowledge.

The [[United States Navy]] construction battalions, nicknamed the [[SeaBees]], puts their command through strenuous training and certifications at every level.  To become a [[Chief Petty Officer]] in the [[SeaBees]] is equivalent to a BS in Construction Management with the added benefit of several years of experience to their credit.  See ACE accreditation.

=== Architectural Project Manager ===
Architectural project manager are project managers in the field of architecture. They have many of the same skills as their counterpart in the construction industry. And will often work closely with the construction project manager in the office of the General Contractor (GC), and at the same time, coordinate the work of the design team and numerous consultants who contribute to a construction project, and manage communication with the client. The issues of budget, scheduling, and quality-control are the responsibility of the Project Manager in an architect's office.

=== Insurance Claim Project Manager ===
In the insurance industry project managers often oversee and manage the restoration of a clients home/office after a fire, flood.
Covering the fields from electronics through to the demolition and constructions contractors.

=== Engineering Project Manager ===
In Engineering, project management is the term used to describe the task of seeing a product/device through the stages of R&amp;D/design to manufacturing stages, working with various professionals in different fields of engineering and manufacturing to go from concept to finished product. Optionally, this can include different versions and standards as required by different countries, requiring knowledge of laws, requirements and infrastructure.

=== IT Project Manager ===
IT Project Management generally falls into two categories, namely Software (Development) Project Manager and Infrastructure Project Manager.
Software Project Manager -- A Software Project Manager has many of the same skills as their counterparts in other industries. Beyond the skills normally associated with traditional project management in industries such as construction and manufacturing, a software project manager will typically have an extensive background in [[software development]]. Many software project managers hold a degree in [[Computer Science]], [[Information Technology]], [[Management of Information Systems]] or another related field.

In traditional project management a heavyweight, predictive methodology such as the [[waterfall model]] is often employed, but software project managers must also be skilled in more lightweight, adaptive methodologies such as [[Dynamic systems development method|DSDM]], [[Scrum (development)|Scrum]] and [[Extreme Programming|XP]]. These project management methodologies are based on the uncertainty of developing a new software system and advocate smaller, incremental development cycles.  These incremental or iterative cycles are time boxed (constrained to a known period of time, typically from one to four weeks) and produce a working subset of the entire system deliverable at the end of each iteration. The increasing adoption of lightweight approaches is due largely to the fact that [[software requirements]] are very susceptible to change, and it is extremely difficult to illuminate all the potential requirements in a single project phase before the software development commences.

The software project manager is also expected to be familiar with the [[Software Development Life Cycle]] (SDLC). This may require in depth knowledge of requirements solicitation, application development, logical and physical database design and networking. This knowledge is typically the result of the aforementioned education and experience.  There is not a widely accepted certification for software project managers, but many will hold the [[Project Management Professional]] (PMP) designation offered by the [[Project Management Institute]], [[PRINCE2]] or an advanced degree in project management, such as a [[MSPM]] or other graduate degree in technology management.

IT Infrastructure Project Management -- An infrastructure IT PM is concerned with the nuts and bolts of the IT department, including computers, servers, storage, networking, and such aspects of them as backup, business continuity, upgrades, replacement, and growth.  Often, a secondary data center will be constructed in a remote location to help protect the business from outages caused by natural disaster or weather.  Recently, cyber security has become a significant growth area within IT infrastructure management.

The infrastructure PM usually has an undergraduate degree in engineering or computer science, with a master's degree in project management required for senior level positions.  Along with the formal education, most senior level PMs are certified, by the Project Management Institute, as a Project Management Professional.  PMI also has several additional certification options, but PMP is by far the most popular.

Infrastructure PMs are responsible for managing projects that have budgets from a few thousand dollars up to many millions of dollars.  They must understand the business and the business goals of the sponsor and the capabilities of the technology in order to reach the desired goals of the project.  The most difficult part of the infrastructure PM's job may be this translation of business needs / wants into technical specifications.  Oftentimes, business analysts are engaged to help with this requirement.  The team size of a large infrastructure project may run into several hundred engineers and technicians, many of whom have strong personalities and require strong leadership if the project goals are to be met.

Due to the high operations expense of maintaining a large staff of highly skilled IT engineering talent, many organizations outsource their infrastructure implementations and upgrades to third party companies.  Many of these companies have strong project management organizations with the ability to not only manage their clients projects, but to also generate high quality revenue at the same time.

== Responsibilities ==

The Project Manager is accountable for ensuring that everyone on the team knows and executes his or her role, feels empowered and supported in the role, knows the roles of the other team members and acts upon the belief that those roles will be performed.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, PMP, D. (2011). Accountability. In Succeeding in the project management jungle: How to manage the people side of projects (p. 29). New York, NY: AMACOM.&lt;/ref&gt; The specific responsibilities of the Project Manager may vary depending on the industry, the company size, the company maturity, and the [[company culture]]. However, there are some responsibilities that are common to all Project Managers, noting:&lt;ref name="PMH"&gt;Berrie, Michele, [http://www.pmhut.com/project-manager-responsibilities Project Manager Responsibilities], PM Hut. Accessed 17. Oct 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5021">'''Sacro-Egoism''' is a term defining a sociological approach in [[Western world|Western society]] wherein the ultimate authority regarding religious thought and interpretation rests with the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Definition created by Dr. John S. Knox, PhD in Theology &amp; Religion (2009), [[University of Birmingham]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

As theological thought evolved, specifically after the advent of [[liberalism]] in the nineteenth century, a change began to take place in the religious world. Religious attitudes and prioritization seem to begin shifting from Sacro-Clericalism, where authority is given to the church and its representatives, to Sacro-Egoism, where the individual assumes greatest authority. The role of the individual, the self, was elevated more than ever before and self-reliance was glamorized, epitomized, and utilized in society—even until the present.

[[Liberal Christianity|Liberal theologians]] like Schleiermacher, Ritschl, and Tillich ". . . sought to anchor that faith in common human experience, and interpret it in ways that made sense within the modern worldview."&lt;ref&gt;Alister McGrath, Historical Theology: An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 1998), 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Schleiermacher, known as the father of modern liberal theology, considered religion and Christianity to be ". . . the distinctly human awareness of something infinite beyond the self on whom the self is dependent for everything."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Olson, The Story of Christian Theology: Twenty Centuries of Tradition &amp; Reform (Illinois, IN: [[Inter-Varsity Press|InterVarsity Press]], 1999), 544.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though first a subtle and infrequent occurrence, more and more the authority and centrality of the Church began to lose ground to the prominence of the individual. Culturally, the expression of religion and Christianity encountered ". . . a turn towards life lived by reference to one's own subjective experiences (relational as much as individualistic)."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Heelas and Linda Woodhead, The Spiritual Revolution: Why Religion is Giving Way to Spirituality (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2005), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Leaning on one's own understanding became an asset, not a detriment, to religious life and approval.

According to Heelas and Woodhead, "The subjectivities of each individual become a, if not the, unique source of significance, meaning and authority."&lt;ref&gt;Heelas and Woodhead, The Spiritual Revolution, 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Grasso continues this understanding stating, "Liberalism's movement toward an ever deeper [[individualism]] receives signal expression in the ascendancy of the type of liberalism that dominates our intellectual scene, in the ascendancy . . . termed the liberalism of the unencumbered self."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth L. Grasso, ‘Christianity, Enlightenment Liberalism, and the Quest for Freedom,’ Modern Age (Fall 2006): 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Starks and Robinson comment that modernists ". . . see individuals and not a deity as the ultimate arbiters of [[moral authority]] and hold to a largely individually directed universe."&lt;ref&gt;Brian Starks and Robert Robinson, ‘Moral Cosmology, Religion, and Adult Values for Children,’ Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 46, no. 1 (March 2007): 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious focus has moved from the institution to the individual.

Currently, this shift can be observed in a variety of ways as mentioned earlier, most visibly in lowered membership and attendance numbers. This situation has been attributed to poor religious offerings, to a modern emphasis on the secular world, to ineffective participation and devotion of believers worldwide, or to the will of God (in some religious circles). While all these may be partially true, the danger is making a synecdoche of the products of decline and overestimating their importance and influence in religion.

Christian society has never operated from a vacuum. Furseth and Repstad state, "It is simply not true that individuals invent their own world-view in a void."&lt;ref&gt;Inger Furseth and Pål Repstad, An Introduction to the [[Sociology of religion|Sociology of Religion]] (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2006), 124.&lt;/ref&gt; From its earliest beginnings, this [[Religion|religious movement]] has interacted closely with culture, as did its founder. Thus, this interaction ". . . is two-way: Christianity both influences and is influenced by culture."&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Historical Theology, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the expression of [[Christianity|Christian faith]] has never been static. Sociological studies of Religion such as the Kendal Project&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fss/projects/ieppp/kendal/methods.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the McMinnville Project&lt;ref&gt;John S. Knox PhD Dissertation Research Project (2006-7).&lt;/ref&gt; aptly demonstrate a religious transformation from older traditional patterns. Sacro-Egoism suggests that at the heart and in the origins of Christianity and modern religion is a personalized, dynamic, individualistic faith. This is Sacro-Egoism.

They are [[ammonium]] oxidizing bacteria found in marine environments.

== Introduction ==
"'''''[[Candidatus]]''''' '''Scalindua'''" is a [[bacterial]] [[genus]], member of the order [[Planctomycetes]]. These bacteria lack [[peptidoglycan]] in their [[cell wall]] and have a compartmentalized [[cytoplasm]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; ''Candidatus'' Scalindua spp. can be further divided into three species: Scalindua brodae, Scalindua wagneri, and Scalindua sorokinii. They are [[ammonium]] oxidising bacteria found in marine environments. The genus ''Ca.'' Scalindua are the most abundant annamox bacteria in marine environments, so they are vital to the Earth's nitrogen cycle.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Metabolism ==
Members of the proposed genus Scalindua are [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[anammox]] (ammonium oxidizing) bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Awata|first=Takanori|last2=Oshiki|first2=Mamoru|last3=Kindaichi|first3=Tomonori|last4=Ozaki|first4=Noriatsu|last5=Ohashi|first5=Akiyoshi|last6=Okabe|first6=Satoshi|date=2017-03-08|title=Physiological Characterization of an Anaerobic Ammonium-Oxidizing Bacterium Belonging to the "Candidatus Scalindua" Group|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|volume=79|issue=13|pages=4145–4148|doi=10.1128/AEM.00056-13|issn=0099-2240|pmc=3697556|pmid=23584767}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ammonium-oxidizing reaction composes a significant part of the global [[nitrogen cycle]]; by some estimates it is the cause of up to 50% of total nitrogen turnover in marine environments.&lt;ref name="Kuenen 320–326"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuenen|first=J. Gijs|date=2008-04-01|title=Anammox bacteria: from discovery to application|url=http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v6/n4/full/nrmicro1857.html|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=320–326|doi=10.1038/nrmicro1857|pmid=18340342|issn=1740-1526}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of the oxidization of ammonium using nitrite as an electron acceptor (both are fixed nitrogen) and subsequent generation of nitrogen gas:

“NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; = N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (ΔG° = -357 kj mol-1)”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Anammox#References|title=Anammox Bacteria|last=|first=|date=|website=Microbewiki|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This reaction uses nitrite (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) as a terminal electron acceptor to produce nitric oxide (NO), which is then combined with ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) to produce the intermediate [[hydrazine]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). [[Hydrazine]], a very reactive molecule also used for rocket fuel, is then oxidized into nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in microbial physiology Volume 60|last=K.|first=Poole, Robert|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Elsevier/Academic Press|isbn=9780123982643|oclc=797831085}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The half reactions may be represented as:

“NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; = NO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (E° = +0.38V)

NO + NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; = N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (E° = +0.06V)
[[File:Anammox mechanism 1.png|thumb|308x308px|Mechanism of Ammonium Oxidation]]
N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (E° = -0.75V)”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

This metabolic pathway occurs anaerobically, something that was once considered impossible as ammonium was thought to be inert in the absence of oxygen.&lt;ref name="Strous"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane and Ammonium|journal = Annual Review of Microbiology|volume = 58|pages = 99–117|last=Strous|first=Marc|last2=Jetten|first2=Mike S.

These reactions occur in a large membrane-bound cellular organelle called the anammoxosome, which contains an electron transport chain and an ATPase that pumps protons back into the cytoplasm from the anammoxosome lumen. It functions much like a mitochondrion in eukaryotic cells. The anammoxosome membrane is invaginated (folded in upon itself) to increase its surface area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niftrik|first=Laura van|last2=Jetten|first2=Mike S.

Anammox bacteria, including those belonging to ''Ca.'' Scalindua, fix carbon using carbon dioxide as a carbon source. Metagenomic analysis has revealed the presence of genes responsible for the “[[reductive acetyl-CoA pathway]] (also known as the [[Wood–Ljungdahl pathway|Wood-Ljungdahl pathway]]) which allows for the creation of the precursor molecule [[Acetyl-CoA|acetyl CoA]] from carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van de Vossenberg|first=Jack|last2=Woebken|first2=Dagmar|last3=Maalcke|first3=Wouter J|last4=Wessels|first4=Hans J C T|last5=Dutilh|first5=Bas E|last6=Kartal|first6=Boran|last7=Janssen-Megens|first7=Eva M|last8=Roeselers|first8=Guus|last9=Yan|first9=Jia|date=2017-03-08|title=The metagenome of the marine anammox bacterium 'Candidatus Scalindua profunda' illustrates the versatility of this globally important nitrogen cycle bacterium|journal=Environmental Microbiology|volume=15|issue=5|pages=1275–1289|doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02774.x|issn=1462-2912|pmc=3655542|pmid=22568606}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kartal|first=Boran|last2=Almeida|first2=De|last3=M|first3=Naomi|last4=Maalcke|first4=Wouter J.|last5=Camp|first5=Op den|last6=J.m|first6=Huub|last7=Jetten|first7=Mike S.

== Discovery and Distribution ==
[[Ammonium]] and [[methane]] are known to be relatively difficult to activate with reactions catalyzed by enzymes that make use of high-potential [[oxygen radicals]], which are unavailable to [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] life, leading to the assumption that both compounds were effectively inactive in low oxygen environments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane and Ammonium|journal = Annual Review of Microbiology|volume = 58|pages = 99–117|last=Strous|first=Marc|last2=Jetten|first2=Mike S.

Organisms within the genus “''Candidatus'' Scalindua” are classified as [[Gram-negative bacteria|gram-negative]] chemolithoautotrophic bacteria.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strous|first=M.|year=1999|title=Missing lithotroph identified as new planctomycete|url=|journal=Nature|volume=400 [6743]|issue=6743|pages=446–449|via=|bibcode=1999Natur.400..446S|doi=10.1038/22749|pmid=10440372}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that their carbon and energy largely come from inorganic sources. Furthermore, bacteria in the genus ''Ca''. Scalindua are obligate anaerobes, so they are unable live in oxygen-rich environments.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmid|first=Markus|year=2003|title=Candidatus "Scalindua brodae", sp. nov., Candidatus "Scalindua wagneri", sp. nov., Two New Species of Anaerobic Ammonium Oxidizing Bacteria|url=|journal=Systematic and Applied Microbiology|volume=26|issue=4|pages=529–538|issn=0723-2020|doi=10.1078/072320203770865837|pmid=14666981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The membrane that surrounds anammoxosomes in [[anammox]] bacteria contains unique lipids called “[[ladderane]]” lipids, which contain a series of cyclobutane ring structures.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; However, all other membranes within [[anammox]] bacteria are similar to organisms within the order [[Planctomycetes]].

== Evolutionary History ==
According to Strous et al., [[anammox]]-capability is the result of a singular evolutionary event. All [[anammox]] bacteria are descendents of the same ancient [[planctomycetes]] species that first evolved the [[anammox]] reaction.&lt;ref name="Strous"/&gt; Members of the proposed genus [[Ca.]] Scalindua are the most widespread of all the genera of anammox bacteria described so far.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;

Currently, all [[anammox]] bacteria are thought to be members of the order Brocadiales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Speth|first=Daan R.|last2=Russ|first2=Lina|last3=Kartal|first3=Boran|last4=op den Camp|first4=Huub J.

Marine sediments located in deep-sea methane seeps contain [[anammox]] bacteria associated with ''Candidatus'' Scalindua spp.; these bacteria likely have a substantial role in the nitrogen cycle in the sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shao|first=Sudong|last2=Luan|first2=Xiwu|last3=Dang|first3=Hongyue|last4=Zhou|first4=Haixia|last5=Zhao|first5=Yakun|last6=Liu|first6=Haitao|last7=Zhang|first7=Yunbo|last8=Dai|first8=Lingqing|last9=Ye|first9=Ying|date=2014-02-01|title=Deep-sea methane seep sediments in the Okhotsk Sea sustain diverse and abundant anammox bacteria|journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology|language=en|volume=87|issue=2|pages=503–516|doi=10.1111/1574-6941.12241|pmid=24164560|issn=0168-6496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sediment transport''' is the movement of solid particles ([[sediment]]), typically due to a combination of gravity acting on the sediment, and/or the movement of the [[fluid]] in which the sediment is entrained. Sediment transport occurs in natural systems where the particles are [[clastic]] rocks ([[sand]], [[gravel]], [[boulders]], etc.), [[mud]], or [[clay]]; the fluid is air, water, or ice; and the force of gravity acts to move the particles along the sloping surface on which they  are resting. Sediment transport due to fluid motion occurs in [[river]]s, [[ocean]]s, [[lake]]s, [[sea]]s, and other bodies of water due to [[current (fluid)|currents]] and [[tide]]s. Transport is also caused by [[glacier]]s as they flow, and on terrestrial surfaces under the influence of [[wind]]. Sediment transport due only to gravity can occur on sloping surfaces in general, including [[hill]]slopes, [[escarpment|scarp]]s, [[cliff]]s, and the [[continental shelf]]—continental slope boundary.

Sediment transport is important in the fields of [[sedimentary geology]], [[geomorphology]], [[civil engineering]] and [[environmental engineering]] (see [[#Applications|applications]], below). Knowledge of sediment transport is most often used to determine whether [[erosion]] or [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] will occur, the magnitude of this erosion or deposition, and the time and distance over which it will occur.

==Mechanisms==

===Aeolian===
{{main|Aeolian processes}}
''Aeolian'' or ''eolian'' (depending on the parsing of [[æ]]) is the term for sediment transport by [[wind]]. This process results in the formation of [[Capillary wave|ripples]] and [[sand dunes]]. Typically, the size of the transported sediment is fine [[sand]] (&lt;1&amp;nbsp;mm) and smaller, because [[air]] is a fluid with low [[density]] and [[viscosity]], and can therefore not exert very much [[Shear strength|shear]] on its bed.

[[Bedform]]s are generated by aeolian sediment transport in the terrestrial near-surface environment. [[Ripple marks|Ripples]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0012-8252(0)90029-U|title=Eolian ripples as examples of self-organization in geomorphological systems|year=1990|last1=Anderson|first1=R|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=29|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dune]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2005.05.005|title=Aeolian dune field self-organization – implications for the formation of simple versus complex dune-field patterns|year=2005|last1=Kocurek|first1=Gary|last2=Ewing|first2=Ryan C.|journal=Geomorphology|volume=72|page=94|bibcode = 2005Geomo..72...94K }}&lt;/ref&gt; form as a natural self-organizing response to sediment transport.

Aeolian sediment transport is common on beaches and in the arid regions of the world, because it is in these environments that vegetation does not prevent the presence and motion of fields of sand.

Wind-blown very fine-grained [[dust]] is capable of entering the upper atmosphere and moving across the globe. Dust from the [[Sahara]] deposits on the [[Canary Islands]] and islands in the [[Caribbean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(01)00067-8|title=Saharan dust storms: nature and consequences|year=2001|author=Goudie, A|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=56|page=179|bibcode=2001ESRv...56..179G|last2=Middleton|first2=N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dust from the [[Gobi desert]] has deposited on the [[western United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=6458&lt;/ref&gt; This sediment is important to the soil budget and ecology of several islands.

Deposits of fine-grained wind-blown [[glacier|glacial]] sediment are called [[loess]].

===Fluvial===
In [[geology]], [[physical geography]], and sediment transport, [[fluvial]] processes relate to flowing [[water]] in natural systems. This encompasses rivers, streams, [[periglacial]] flows, [[flash floods]] and [[glacial lake outburst flood]]s. Sediment moved by water can be larger than sediment moved by air because water has both a higher [[density]] and [[viscosity]]. In typical rivers the largest carried sediment is of [[sand]] and [[gravel]] size, but larger floods can carry [[cobbles]] and even [[boulders]].

Fluvial sediment transport can result in the formation of [[ripple marks|ripple]]s and [[dune]]s, in [[fractal]]-shaped patterns of erosion, in complex patterns of natural river systems, and in the development of [[floodplain]]s.

[[File:Laysan beach.jpg|thumb|left|Sand [[Ripple marks|ripples]], [[Laysan Beach]], [[Hawaii]]. Coastal '''sediment transport''' results in these evenly spaced ripples along the shore. [[Monk seal]] for scale.]]

===Coastal===
{{main|Coastal sediment transport}}
Coastal sediment transport takes place in near-shore environments due to the motions of waves and currents. At the mouths of rivers, coastal sediment and fluvial sediment transport processes mesh to create [[river delta]]s.

Coastal sediment transport results in the formation of characteristic coastal landforms such as [[beach]]es, [[barrier islands]], and capes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashton|first1=Andrew|last2=Murray|first2=A. Brad|last3=Arnault|first3=Olivier|journal=Nature|volume=414|pages=296–300|year=2001|doi=10.1038/35104541|issue=6861|pmid=11713526|title=Formation of coastline features by large-scale instabilities induced by high-angle waves|bibcode = 2001Natur.414..296A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glacier.zermatt.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|A [[glacier]] joining the [[Gorner Glacier]], [[Zermatt, Switzerland]]. These glaciers transport [[sediment]] and leave behind [[lateral moraines]].]]

===Glacial===
As glaciers move over their beds, they entrain and move material of all sizes. Glaciers can carry the largest sediment, and areas of glacial deposition often contain a large number of [[glacial erratics]], many of which are several metres in diameter. Glaciers also pulverize rock into "[[glacial flour]]", which is so fine that it is often carried away by winds to create [[loess]] deposits thousands of kilometres afield. Sediment entrained in glaciers often moves approximately along the glacial [[flowline]]s, causing it to appear at the surface in the [[ablation zone]].

===Hillslope===
In hillslope sediment transport, a variety of processes move [[regolith]] downslope. These include:
*[[Soil creep]]
*[[Tree throw]]
*Movement of  soil by burrowing animals
*Slumping and landsliding of the hillslope

These processes generally combine to give the hillslope a profile that looks like a solution to the [[diffusion equation]], where the diffusivity is a parameter that relates to the ease of sediment transport on the particular hillslope. For this reason, the tops of hills generally have a parabolic concave-up profile, which grades into a convex-up profile around valleys.

As hillslopes steepen, however, they become more prone to episodic [[landslide]]s and other [[mass wasting]] events. Therefore, hillslope processes are better described by a nonlinear diffusion equation in which classic diffusion dominates for shallow slopes and erosion rates go to infinity as the hillslope reaches a critical [[angle of repose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roering|first1=Joshua J.|last2=Kirchner|first2=James W.|last3=Dietrich|first3=William E.|title=Evidence for nonlinear, diffusive sediment transport on hillslopes and implications for landscape morphology|journal=Water Resources Research|volume=35|page=853|year=1999|doi=10.1029/1998WR900090|bibcode=1999WRR....35..853R|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debris flow===

Large masses of material are moved in [[debris flow]]s, [[hyperconcentrated flow|hyperconcentrated]] mixtures of mud, clasts that range up to boulder-size, and water. Debris flows move as [[granular flow]]s down steep mountain valleys and washes. Because they transport sediment as a granular mixture, their transport mechanisms and capacities scale differently from those of fluvial systems.

==Applications==
[[File:IsfjordenSediment.JPG|thumb|Suspended sediment from a stream emptying into a fjord ([[Isfjord, Svalbard|Isfjorden]], Svalbard, Norway).]]

Sediment transport is applied to solve many environmental, geotechnical, and geological problems. Measuring or quantifying sediment transport or erosion is therefore important for [[coastal engineering]]. Several sediment erosion devices have been designed in order to quantitfy sediment erosion (e.g., Particle Erosion Simulator (PES)). One such device, also referred to as the BEAST (Benthic Environmental Assessment Sediment Tool) has been calibrated in order to quantify rates of sediment erosion.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, J., Walker, T.R., Hill P.S., Lintern, D.G. (2013) BEAST-A portable device for quantification of erosion in intact sediment cores. Methods in Oceanography. DOI: 10.1016/j.mio.2013.03.001&lt;/ref&gt;

Movement of sediment is important in providing habitat for fish and other organisms in rivers. Therefore, managers of highly regulated rivers, which are often sediment-starved due to dams, are often advised to stage short floods to refresh the bed material and rebuild bars. This is also important, for example, in the [[Grand Canyon]] of the [[Colorado River]], to rebuild shoreline habitats also used as campsites.

Sediment discharge into a reservoir formed by a dam forms a reservoir [[River delta|delta]]. This delta will fill the basin, and eventually, either the reservoir will need to be dredged or the dam will need to be removed. Knowledge of sediment transport can be used to properly plan to extend the life of a dam.

Geologists can use inverse solutions of transport relationships to understand flow depth, velocity, and direction, from sedimentary rocks and young deposits of alluvial materials.

Flow in culverts, over dams, and around bridge piers can cause erosion of the bed. This erosion can damage the environment and expose or unsettle the foundations of the structure. Therefore, good knowledge of the mechanics of sediment transport in a built environment are important for civil and hydraulic engineers.

When suspended sediment transport is increased due to human activities, causing environmental problems including the filling of channels, it is called [[siltation]] after the grain-size fraction dominating the process.

==Initiation of motion==
{{howto|date=February 2016}}

===Stress balance===

For a fluid to begin transporting sediment that is currently at rest on a surface, the boundary (or bed) [[shear stress]] &lt;math&gt;\tau_b&lt;/math&gt; exerted by the fluid must exceed the critical shear stress &lt;math&gt;\tau_c&lt;/math&gt; for the initiation of motion of grains at the bed. This basic criterion for the initiation of motion can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\tau_c&lt;/math&gt;.

This is typically represented by a comparison between a [[dimensionless]] shear stress (&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*&lt;/math&gt;)and a dimensionless critical shear stress (&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;). The nondimensionalization is in order to compare the driving forces of particle motion (shear stress) to the resisting forces that would make it stationary (particle density and size). This dimensionless shear stress, &lt;math&gt;\tau*&lt;/math&gt;, is called the [[Shields parameter]] and is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;Shields, A. (1936) Anwendung der Ähnlichkeitsmechanik und der Turbulenzforschung auf die Geschiebebewegung; In Mitteilungen der Preussischen Versuchsanstalt für Wasserbau und Schiffbau, Heft 26 ([http://repository.tudelft.nl/assets/uuid:61a19716-a994-4942-9906-f680eb9952d6/Shields.pdf Online]; PDF; 3,8&amp;nbsp;MB)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau*=\frac{\tau}{(\rho_s-\rho_f)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;.

And the new equation to solve becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*=\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;.

The equations included here describe sediment transport for [[clastic]], or [[granular]] sediment. They do not work for [[clays]] and [[muds]] because these types of [[Flocculation|floccular]] sediments do not fit the geometric simplifications in these equations, and also interact thorough [[electrostatic]] forces. The equations were also designed for [[fluvial]] sediment transport of particles carried along in a liquid flow, such as that in a river, canal, or other open channel.

Only one size of particle is considered in this equation. However, river beds are often formed by a mixture of sediment of various sizes. In case of partial motion where only a part of the sediment mixture moves, the river bed becomes enriched in large gravel as the smaller sediments are washed away. The smaller sediments present under this layer of large gravel have a lower possibility of movement and total sediment transport decreases. This is called armouring effect.&lt;ref&gt;Saniya Sharmeen and Garry R. Willgoose1, 
The interaction between armouring and particle weathering for eroding landscapes, ''[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]'' 31, 1195–1210 (2006)

&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of armouring of sediment or decreasing rates of sediment erosion can be caused by carpets of microbial mats, under conditions of high organic loading.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, T.R., Grant, J. (2009) Quantifying erosion rates and stability of bottom sediments at mussel aquaculture sites in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Journal of Marine Systems. 75: 46-55. doi:10.1016/j.jmarsys.2008.07.009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical shear stress===

[[File:Shields diagram.jpg|thumb|300px|Original Shields diagram, 1936]]
The Shields{{fix|Diagram, citation}} diagram empirically shows how the dimensionless critical shear stress (i.e. the dimensionless shear stress required for the initiation of motion) is a function of a particular form of the particle [[Reynolds number]], &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}_p&lt;/math&gt; or Reynolds number related to the particle. This allows us to rewrite the criterion for the initiation of motion in terms of only needing to solve for a specific version of the particle Reynolds number, which we call &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}_p*&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*=f\left(\mathrm{Re}_p*\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can then be solved by using the empirically derived Shields curve to find &lt;math&gt;\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt; as a function of a specific form of the particle Reynolds number called the boundary Reynolds number. The mathematical solution of the equation was given by [[Subhasish Dey|Dey]].&lt;ref&gt;Dey S. (1999) Sediment threshold. ''Applied Mathematical Modelling'', Elsevier, Vol. 23, No. 5, 399-417.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Particle Reynolds Number===

In general, a particle Reynolds Number has the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}_p=\frac{U_p D}{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;U_p&lt;/math&gt; is a characteristic particle velocity, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the grain diameter (a characteristic particle size), and &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the kinematic viscosity, which is given by the dynamic viscosity, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, divided by the fluid density, &lt;math&gt;{\rho_f}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\nu=\frac{\mu}{\rho_f}&lt;/math&gt;

The specific particle Reynolds number of interest is called the boundary Reynolds number, and it is formed by replacing the velocity term in the Particle Reynolds number by the [[shear velocity]], &lt;math&gt;u_*&lt;/math&gt;, which is a way of rewriting shear stress in terms of velocity.

:&lt;math&gt;u_*=\sqrt{\frac{\tau_b}{\rho_f}}=\kappa z \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau_b&lt;/math&gt; is the bed shear stress (described below), and &lt;math&gt; \kappa &lt;/math&gt; is the [[von Kármán constant]], where

:&lt;math&gt; \kappa = {0.407}&lt;/math&gt;.

The particle Reynolds number is therefore given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}_p*=\frac{u_* D}{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

===Bed shear stress===

The boundary Reynolds number can be used with the Shields diagram to empirically solve the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=f\left(\mathrm{Re}_p*\right)&lt;/math&gt;,

which solves the right-hand side of the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*=\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;.

In order to solve the left-hand side, expanded as

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*=\frac{\tau_b}{(\rho_s-\rho_f)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;,

we must find the bed shear stress, &lt;math&gt;{\tau_b}&lt;/math&gt;. There are several ways to solve for the bed shear stress. First, we develop the simplest approach, in which the flow is assumed to be steady and uniform and reach-averaged depth and slope are used. Due to the difficulty of measuring shear stress ''in situ'', this method is also one of the most-commonly used. This method is known as the [[depth-slope product]].

====Depth-slope product====
{{main|Depth-slope product}}

For a river undergoing approximately steady, uniform equilibrium flow, of approximately constant depth ''h'' and slope angle θ over the reach of interest, and whose width is much greater than its depth, the bed shear stress is given by some momentum considerations stating that the gravity force component in the flow direction equals exactly the friction force.&lt;ref name="Chanson"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson]] |title= The Hydraulics of Open Channel Flow: An Introduction |publisher= Butterworth-Heinemann, 2nd edition, Oxford, UK, 630 pages |year=2004  |isbn=978-0-7506-5978-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a wide channel, it yields:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\rho g h \sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

For shallow slope angles, which are found in almost all natural lowland streams, the [[small-angle formula]] shows that &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, which is given by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, the slope. Rewritten with this:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\rho g h S&lt;/math&gt;

====Shear velocity, velocity, and friction factor====

For the steady case, by extrapolating the depth-slope product and the equation for shear velocity:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\rho g h S&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u_*=\sqrt{\left(\frac{\tau_b}{\rho}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;,

We can see that the depth-slope product can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\rho u_*^2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;u*&lt;/math&gt; is related to the mean flow velocity, &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt;, through the generalized [[Darcy-Weisbach friction factor]], &lt;math&gt;C_f&lt;/math&gt;, which is equal to the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor divided by 8 (for mathematical convenience).&lt;ref name="whipple roughness"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-163-surface-processes-and-landscape-evolution-fall-2004/labs/roughnes_handout.pdf|title=Hydraulic Roughness|last=Whipple|first=Kelin|year=2004|work=12.163: Surface processes and landscape evolution|publisher=MIT OCW|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inserting this friction factor,

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b=\rho C_f \left(\bar{u} \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;.

====Unsteady flow====
For all flows that cannot be simplified as a single-slope infinite channel (as in the [[depth-slope product]], above), the bed shear stress can be locally found by applying the [[Shallow water equations|Saint-Venant equations]] for [[continuity equation|continuity]], which consider accelerations within the flow.

===Example===

====Set-up====

The criterion for the initiation of motion, established earlier, states that

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_b*=\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;.

In this equation,

:&lt;math&gt;\tau*=\frac{\tau}{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\tau_b}{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}=\frac{\tau_{c}}{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt; is a function of boundary Reynolds number, a specific type of particle Reynolds number.

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=f \left(Re_p* \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

For a particular particle Reynolds number, &lt;math&gt;\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt; will be an emprical constant given by the Shields Curve or by another set of empirical data (depending on whether or not the grain size is uniform).

Therefore, the final equation that we seek to solve is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\tau_b}{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}=f \left(Re_p* \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

====Solution====

We make several assumptions to provide an example that will allow us to bring the above form of the equation into a solved form.

First, we assume that the a good approximation of reach-averaged shear stress is given by the depth-slope product. We can then rewrite the equation as

:&lt;math&gt;{\rho g h S}=0.06{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Moving and re-combining the terms, we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;{h S}={\frac{(\rho_s-\rho)}{\rho}(D)}\left(f \left(\mathrm{Re}_p* \right) \right)=R D \left(f \left(\mathrm{Re}_p* \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where R is the [[submerged specific gravity]] of the sediment.

We then make our second assumption, which is that the particle Reynolds number is high. This is typically applicable to particles of gravel-size or larger in a stream, and means that the critical shear stress is a constant. The Shields curve shows that for a bed with a uniform grain size,

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=0.06&lt;/math&gt;.

Later researchers{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} have shown that this value is closer to

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=0.03&lt;/math&gt;

for more uniformly sorted beds. Therefore, we will simply insert

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=f \left(\mathrm{Re}_p* \right)&lt;/math&gt;

and insert both values at the end.

The equation now reads:

:&lt;math&gt;{h S}=R D \tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;

This final expression shows that the product of the channel depth and slope is equal to the Shield's criterion times the submerged specific gravity of the particles times the particle diameter.

For a typical situation, such as quartz-rich sediment &lt;math&gt;\left(\rho_s=2650 \frac{kg}{m^3} \right)&lt;/math&gt; in water &lt;math&gt;\left(\rho=1000 \frac{kg}{m^3} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, the submerged specific gravity is equal to 1.65.

:&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{(\rho_s-\rho)}{\rho}=1.65&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this into the equation above,

:&lt;math&gt;{h S}=1.65(D)\tau_c*&lt;/math&gt;.

For the Shield's criterion of &lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=0.06&lt;/math&gt;. 0.06 * 1.65 = 0.099, which is well within standard margins of error of 0.1. Therefore, for a uniform bed,

:&lt;math&gt;{h S}={0.1(D)}&lt;/math&gt;.

For these situations, the product of the depth and slope of the flow should be 10% of the diameter of the median grain diameter.

The mixed-grain-size bed value is &lt;math&gt;\tau_c*=0.03&lt;/math&gt;, which is supported by more recent research as being more broadly applicable because most natural streams have mixed grain sizes. Using this value, and changing D to D_50 ("50" for the 50th percentile, or the median grain size, as we are now looking at a mixed-grain-size bed), the equation becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;{h S}={0.05(D_{50})}&lt;/math&gt;

Which means that the depth times the slope should be about 5% of the median grain diameter in the case of a mixed-grain-size bed.

==Modes of entrainment==

The sediments entrained in a flow can be transported along the bed as [[bed load]] in the form of sliding and rolling grains, or in suspension as [[suspended load]] advected by the main flow.&lt;ref name="Chanson" /&gt; Some sediment materials may also come from the upstream reaches and be carried downstream in the form of [[wash load]].

===Rouse number===

The location in the flow in which a particle is entrained is determined by the [[Rouse number]], which is determined by the density ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; and diameter ''d'' of the sediment particle, and the density ''ρ'' and kinematic viscosity ''ν'' of the fluid, determine in which part of the flow the sediment particle will be carried.&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-163-surface-processes-and-landscape-evolution-fall-2004/lecture-notes/4_sediment_transport_edited.pdf|title=IV.

:&lt;math&gt;P=\frac{w_s}{\kappa u_\ast}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the Rouse number is given by ''P''. The term in the numerator is the (downwards) sediment the sediment [[Terminal velocity|settling velocity]] ''w''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;, which is discussed below. The upwards velocity on the grain is given as a product of the [[von Kármán constant]], ''κ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.4, and the [[shear velocity]], ''u''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;.

The following table gives the approximate required Rouse numbers for transport as [[bed load]], [[suspended load]], and [[wash load]].&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moore_loose_ends"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_20.pdf|title=Lecture 20—Some Loose Ends|last=Moore|first=Andrew|work=Lecture Notes: Fluvial Sediment Transport|location=Kent State|accessdate=23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settling velocity===
[[File:Stokes sphere.svg|thumb|Streamlines around a sphere falling through a fluid. This illustration is accurate for [[laminar flow]], in which the particle [[Reynolds number]] is small. This is typical for small particles falling through a viscous fluid; larger particles would result in the creation of a [[turbulence|turbulent]] wake.]]

The settling velocity (also called the "fall velocity" or "[[terminal velocity]]") is a function of the particle [[Reynolds number]]. Generally, for small particles (laminar approximation), it can be calculated with [[Stokes' Law]]. For larger particles (turbulent particle Reynolds numbers), fall velocity is calculated with the turbulent [[Drag (physics)|drag]] law. [[William E. Dietrich|Dietrich]] (1982) compiled a large amount of published data to which he empirically fit settling velocity curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dietrich|first=W. E.|year=1982|title=Settling Velocity of Natural Particles|journal=Water Resources Research|volume=18|issue=6|pages=1615–1626|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~jvenditt/geog413_613/readings/1982_Dietrich_settling_velocity.pdf|doi=10.1029/WR018i006p01615|bibcode=1982WRR....18.1615D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson and Church (2006) analytically combined the expressions for Stokes flow and a turbulent drag law into a single equation that works for all sizes of sediment, and successfully tested it against the data of Dietrich.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, R. I., and M. Church (2006), A Simple Universal Equation for Grain Settling Velocity, Journal of Sedimentary Research, 74(6) 933-937, {{doi|10.1306/051204740933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their equation is

:&lt;math&gt;w_s=\frac{RgD^2}{C_1 \nu + (0.75 C_2 R g D^3)^{(0.5)}}&lt;/math&gt;.

In this equation ''w&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the sediment settling velocity, ''g'' is acceleration due to gravity, and ''D'' is mean sediment diameter. &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[kinematic viscosity]] of [[water]], which is approximately 1.0 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s for water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C.

&lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; are constants related to the shape and smoothness of the grains.

The expression for fall velocity can be simplified so that it can be solved only in terms of ''D''. We use the sieve diameters for natural grains, &lt;math&gt;g=9.8&lt;/math&gt;, and values given above for &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. From these parameters, the fall velocity is given by the expression:

:&lt;math&gt;w_s=\frac{16.17D^2}{1.8\cdot10^{-5} + (12.1275D^3)^{(0.5)}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Hjulström-Sundborg Diagram==
[[File:Hjulströms diagram en.PNG|thumb|300px|The [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] Hjulström curve]]
In 1935, [[Filip Hjulström]] created the [[Hjulström curve]], a graph which shows the relationship between the size of sediment and the velocity required to erode (lift it), transport it, or deposit it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coolgeography.co.uk/A-level/AQA/Year%2012/Rivers,%20Floods/Long%20profile/Hjulstrom.htm The long profile – changing processes: types of erosion, transportation and deposition, types of load; the Hjulstrom curve]. coolgeography.co.uk. Last accessed 26 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The graph is [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]].

[[Åke Sundborg]] later modified the Hjulström curve to show separate curves for the movement threshold corresponding to several water depths, as is necessary if the flow velocity rather than the boundary shear stress (as in the Shields diagram) is used for the flow strength.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-090-special-topics-an-introduction-to-fluid-motions-sediment-transport-and-current-generated-sedimentary-structures-fall-2006/lecture-notes/ch9.pdf Special Topics: An Introduction to Fluid Motions, Sediment Transport, and Current-generated Sedimentary Structures; As taught in: Fall 2006]. [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. 2006. Last accessed 26 Dec 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

This curve has no more than a historical value nowadays, although its simplicity is still attractive. Among the drawbacks of this curve are that it does not take the water depth into account and more importantly, that it does not show that sedimentation is caused by flow velocity ''deceleration'' and erosion is caused by flow ''acceleration''. The dimensionless Shields diagram is now unanimously accepted for initiation of sediment motion in rivers.

==Transport rate==
[[File:Stream Load.gif|thumb|500px|right|A schematic diagram of where the different types of sediment load are carried in the flow. [[Dissolved load]] is not sediment: it is composed of disassociated [[ion]]s moving along with the flow. It may, however, constitute a significant proportion (often several percent, but occasionally greater than half) of the total amount of material being transported by the stream.]]

Formulas to calculate sediment transport rate exist for sediment moving in several different parts of the flow. These formulas are often segregated into [[bed load]], [[suspended load]], and [[wash load]]. They may sometimes also be segregated into [[bed material load]] and wash load.

===Bed Load===
Bed load moves by rolling, sliding, and hopping (or [[saltation (geology)|saltating]]) over the bed, and moves at a small fraction of the fluid flow velocity. Bed load is generally thought to constitute 5-10% of the total sediment load in a stream, making it less important in terms of mass balance. However, the [[bed material load]] (the bed load plus the portion of the suspended load which comprises material derived from the bed) is often dominated by bed load, especially in gravel-bed rivers. This bed material load is the only part of the sediment load that actively interacts with the bed. As the bed load is an important component of that, it plays a major role in controlling the morphology of the channel.

Bed load transport rates are usually expressed as being related to excess dimensionless shear stress raised to some power. Excess dimensionless shear stress is a nondimensional measure of bed shear stress about the threshold for motion.

:&lt;math&gt;(\tau^*_b-\tau^*_c)&lt;/math&gt;,

Bed load transport rates may also be given by a ratio of bed shear stress to critical shear stress, which is equivalent in both the dimensional and nondimensional cases. This ratio is called the "transport stage" &lt;math&gt;(T_s \text{ or } \phi)&lt;/math&gt; and is an important in that it shows bed shear stress as a multiple of the value of the criterion for the initiation of motion.

:&lt;math&gt;T_s=\phi=\frac{\tau_b}{\tau_c}&lt;/math&gt;

When used for sediment transport formulae, this ratio is typically raised to a power.

The majority of the published relations for bedload transport are given in dry sediment weight per unit channel width, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; ("[[breadth]]"):

:&lt;math&gt;q_s=\frac{Q_s}{b}&lt;/math&gt;.

Due to the difficulty of estimating bed load transport rates, these equations are typically only suitable for the situations for which they were designed.

====Notable bed load transport formulae====

=====Meyer-Peter Müller and derivatives=====

The transport formula of Meyer-Peter and Müller, originally developed in 1948,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyer-Peter|first=E|author2=Müller, R.|title=Formulas for bed-load transport|year=1948|series=Proceedings of the 2nd Meeting of the International Association for Hydraulic Structures Research|pages=39–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; was designed for well-[[sorting (sediment)|sorted]] [[particle size (grain size)|fine]] [[gravel]] at a transport stage of about 8.&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt; The formula uses the above nondimensionalization for shear stress,&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tau*=\frac{\tau}{(\rho_s-\rho)(g)(D)}&lt;/math&gt;,

and [[Hans Albert Einstein|Hans Einstein's]] nondimensionalization for sediment volumetric discharge per unit width&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;q_s* = \frac{q_s}{D \sqrt{\frac{\rho_s-\rho}{\rho} g D}} = \frac{q_s}{Re_p \nu}&lt;/math&gt;.

Their formula reads:

:&lt;math&gt;q_s* = 8\left(\tau*-\tau*_c \right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;

Their experimentally determined value for &lt;math&gt;\tau*_c&lt;/math&gt; is 0.047, and is the third commonly used value for this (in addition to Parker's 0.03 and Shields' 0.06).

Because of its broad use, some revisions to the formula have taken place over the years that show that the coefficient on the left ("8" above) is a function of the transport stage:&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="f-l"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernandez-Luque|first=R|author2=van Beek, R|year=1976|title=Erosion and transport of bedload sediment|journal=Jour.

The variations in the coefficient were later generalized as a function of dimensionless shear stress:&lt;ref name="whipple sed trans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wiberg_smith"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1989)115:1(101)|title=Model for Calculating Bed Load Transport of Sediment|year=1989|last1=Wiberg|first1=Patricia L.|first2=J.|journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|volume=115|page=101|last2=Dungan Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Wilcock and Crowe=====

In 2003, [[Peter Wilcock (scientist)|Peter Wilcock]] and Joanna Crowe (now Joanna Curran) published a sediment transport formula that works with multiple grain sizes across the sand and gravel range.&lt;ref name=wilcock_crowe&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2003)129:2(120)|title=Surface-based Transport Model for Mixed-Size Sediment|year=2003|last1=Wilcock|first1=Peter R.|last2=Crowe|first2=Joanna C.|journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|volume=129|page=120|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their formula works with surface grain size distributions, as opposed to older models which use subsurface grain size distributions (and thereby implicitly infer a surface grain [[sorting (sediment)|sorting]]).

Their expression is more complicated than the basic sediment transport rules (such as that of Meyer-Peter and Müller) because it takes into account multiple grain sizes: this requires consideration of reference shear stresses for each grain size, the fraction of the total sediment supply that falls into each grain size class, and a "hiding function".

The "hiding function" takes into account the fact that, while small grains are inherently more mobile than large grains, on a mixed-grain-size bed, they may be trapped in deep pockets between large grains. Likewise, a large grain on a bed of small particles will be stuck in a much smaller pocket than if it were on a bed of grains of the same size. In gravel-bed rivers, this can cause "equal mobility", in which small grains can move just as easily as large ones.&lt;ref name="parker_etal_1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=G.|author2=Klingeman, P. C. |author3=McLean, D. G. |year=1982|title=Bedload and Size Distribution in Paved Gravel-Bed Streams|journal=Journal of the Hydraulics Division|publisher=[[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]]|volume=108|issue=4|pages=544–571|url=http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?8200331}}&lt;/ref&gt; As sand is added to the system, it moves away from the "equal mobility" portion of the hiding function to one in which grain size again matters.&lt;ref name=wilcock_crowe /&gt;

Their model is based on the transport stage, or ratio of bed shear stress to critical shear stress for the initiation of grain motion. Because their formula works with several grain sizes simultaneously, they define the critical shear stress for each grain size class, &lt;math&gt;\tau_{c,D_i}&lt;/math&gt;, to be equal to a "reference shear stress", &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ri}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=wilcock_crowe/&gt;

They express their equations in terms of a dimensionless transport parameter, &lt;math&gt;W_i^*&lt;/math&gt; (with the "&lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;" indicating nondimensionality and the "&lt;math&gt;_i&lt;/math&gt;" indicating that it is a function of grain size):

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = \frac{R g q_{bi}}{F_i u*^3}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q_{bi}&lt;/math&gt; is the volumetric bed load transport rate of size class &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; per unit channel width &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; is the proportion of size class &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; that is present on the bed.

They came up with two equations, depending on the transport stage, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt; 1.35&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = 0.002 \phi^{7.5}&lt;/math&gt;

and for &lt;math&gt;\phi \geq 1.35&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = 14 \left(1 - \frac{0.894}{\phi^{0.5}}\right)^{4.5}&lt;/math&gt;.

This equation asymptotically reaches a constant value of &lt;math&gt;W_i^*&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; becomes large.

R.|title=Two-fraction model of initial sediment motion in gravel-bed rivers|journal=Science|date=1998|issue=280|pages=410–412|bibcode = 1998Sci...280..410W }}&lt;/ref&gt; published a sediment bed-load transport formula that works with only  two sediments fractions, i.e. sand and gravel fractions.&lt;ref name=wilcock_Kenworthy&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2001WR000684|title=A two-fraction model for the transport of sand/gravel mixtures|year=2002|last1=Wilcock|first1=Peter R.|last2=Kenworthy|first2=T.|journal=Water Resour. Res.|volume=38|page=1194|issue=10|bibcode = 2002WRR....38.1194W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Wilcock and Kenworthy T.A. in their article recognized  that a mixed-sized sediment bed-load transport model using only two fractions offers practical advantages in terms of both computational and conceptual modeling by taking into account the nonlinear effects of sand presence in gravel beds on bed-load transport rate of both fractions. In fact, in the two-fraction bed load formula appears a new ingredient with respect to that of Meyer-Peter and Müller that is the proportion &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; of fraction &lt;math&gt;i &lt;/math&gt; on the bed surface where  the subscript &lt;math&gt;_i &lt;/math&gt; represents either the sand (s) or gravel (g) fraction. The proportion &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of  sand content &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt;, physically represents the relative influence of the mechanisms controlling sand and gravel transport, associated with the change from a clast-supported to matrix-supported gravel bed. Moreover, since &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; spans between 0 and 1, phenomena that vary with &lt;math&gt;f_s&lt;/math&gt; include the relative size effects producing ‘‘hiding’’ of fine grains and ‘‘exposure’’ of coarse grains.
The ‘‘hiding’’ effect takes into account the fact that, while small grains are inherently more mobile than large grains, on a mixed-grain-size bed, they may be trapped in deep pockets between large grains. Likewise, a large grain on a bed of small particles will be stuck in a much smaller pocket than if it were on a bed of grains of the same size, which the Meyer-Peter and Müller formula refers to. In gravel-bed rivers, this can cause ‘‘equal mobility", in which small grains can move just as easily as large ones.&lt;ref name="parker_etal_1982"/&gt; As sand is added to the system, it moves away from the ‘‘equal mobility’’ portion of the hiding function to one in which grain size again matters.&lt;ref name=wilcock_Kenworthy /&gt;

Their model is based on the transport stage,''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, or ratio of bed shear stress to critical shear stress for the initiation of grain motion. Because their formula works with only two fractions simultaneously, they define the critical shear stress for each of the two grain size classes, &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ri}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;_i &lt;/math&gt; represents either the sand (s) or gravel (g) fraction . The critical shear stress that represents the incipient motion for each of the two fractions is consistent with established values in the limit of pure sand and gravel beds and shows a sharp change with increasing sand content over the transition from a clast- to matrix-supported bed.&lt;ref name=wilcock_Kenworthy/&gt;

They express their equations in terms of a dimensionless transport parameter, &lt;math&gt;W_i^*&lt;/math&gt; (with the "&lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;" indicating nondimensionality and the ‘‘&lt;math&gt;_i&lt;/math&gt;’’ indicating that it is a function of grain size):

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = \frac{R g q_{bi}}{F_i u*^3}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q_{bi}&lt;/math&gt; is the volumetric bed load transport rate of size class &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; per unit channel width &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt; is the proportion of size class &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; that is present on the bed.

They came up with two equations, depending on the transport stage, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt; \phi^'&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = 0.002 \phi^{7.5}&lt;/math&gt;

and for &lt;math&gt;\phi \geq \phi^'&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;W_i^* = A \left(1 - \frac{\chi}{\phi^{0.5}}\right)^{4.5}&lt;/math&gt;.

This equation asymptotically reaches a constant value of &lt;math&gt;W_i^*&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; becomes large and the symbols &lt;math&gt;A,\phi^',\chi&lt;/math&gt; have the following values:
:&lt;math&gt;A = 70 ,\phi^'=1.19 ,\chi=0.908, \text{laboratory}&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;A = 115, \phi^'=1.27 ,\chi=0.923, \text{field}&lt;/math&gt;
In order to apply the above formulation, it is necessary to specify the characteristic grain sizes &lt;math&gt;D_s&lt;/math&gt; for the sand portion and &lt;math&gt;D_g&lt;/math&gt; for the gravel portion of the surface layer, the fractions &lt;math&gt; F_s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; F_g&lt;/math&gt; of sand and gravel, respectively in the surface layer, the submerged specific gravity of the sediment R and shear velocity associated with skin friction &lt;math&gt; u_*&lt;/math&gt; .

===== Kuhnle ''et al.''=====
For the case in which sand fraction is transported by the current over and through an immobile gravel bed, Kuhnle ''et al.''(2013),&lt;ref name=Kuhnle&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuhnle|first1=R. A.|last2=Wren|first2=D. G.|last3=Langendoen|first3=E. J.|last4=Rigby|first4=J. R.|title=Sand Transport over an Immobile Gravel Substrate|journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|date=2013|volume=139|issue=2|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000615}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the theoretical analysis done by Pellachini (2011),&lt;ref name=Pellachini&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pellachini|first1=Corrado|title=Modelling fine sediment transport over an immobile gravel bed|date=2011|publisher=Unitn-eprints|location=Trento|url=http://eprints-phd.biblio.unitn.it/605/}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a new relationship for the bed load transport of the sand fraction when gravel particles remain at rest. It is worth mentioning that Kuhnle ''et al.'' (2013)&lt;ref name=Kuhnle/&gt; applied the Wilcock and Kenworthy (2002)&lt;ref name=wilcock_Kenworthy /&gt; formula to their experimental data and found out that predicted bed load rates of sand fraction were about 10 times greater than measured and approached 1 as the sand elevation became near the top of the gravel layer.&lt;ref name=Kuhnle/&gt; They, also, hypothesized that the mismatch between predicted and measured sand bed load rates is due to the fact that the bed shear stress used for the Wilcock and Kenworthy (2002)&lt;ref name=wilcock_Kenworthy /&gt; formula  was larger than that available for transport within the gravel bed because of the sheltering effect of the gravel particles.&lt;ref name=Kuhnle/&gt;
To overcome this mismatch, following Pellachini (2011),&lt;ref name=Pellachini/&gt; they assumed that the variability of the bed shear stress available for the sand to be transported by the current would be some function of the so-called "Roughness Geometry Function" (RGF),&lt;ref name=Nikora&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nikora|first1=V|last2=Goring|first2=D|last3=McEwan|first3=I|last4=Griffiths|first4=G|title=Spatially averaged open-channel flow over rough bed|journal=J. Hydraul. Eng.|date=2001|volume=127|issue=2|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2001)127:2(123)}}&lt;/ref&gt; which represents the  gravel bed elevations distribution. Therefore, the sand bed load formula follows as:&lt;ref name=Kuhnle/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q^*_s = 2.29*10^{-5} A(z_s)^{2.14}\left(\frac{\tau_b}{\tau_{cs} } \right)^{3.49}&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;q^*_s = \frac{q_s}{[(s-1)gD_s]^{0.5}\rho_sD_s}&lt;/math&gt;
the subscript &lt;math&gt;_s&lt;/math&gt; refers to the sand fraction, s represents the ratio &lt;math&gt;\rho_s/\rho_w&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \rho_s&lt;/math&gt; is the sand fraction density, &lt;math&gt; A(z_s)&lt;/math&gt; is the RGF as a function of the sand level &lt;math&gt; z_s&lt;/math&gt; within the gravel bed,  &lt;math&gt; \tau_b&lt;/math&gt; is the bed shear stress available for sand transport and &lt;math&gt; \tau_{cs}&lt;/math&gt; is the critical shear stress for incipient motion of the sand fraction, which was calculated graphically using the updated Shields-type relation of Miller ''et al.''(1977)&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=M.C.|last2=McCave|first2=I.N.|last3=Komar|first3=P.D.|title=Threshold of sediment motion under unidirectional currents.|journal=Sedimentology|date=1977|volume=24|issue=4|pages=507–527|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3091.1977.tb00136.x|bibcode = 1977Sedim..24..507M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspended load===
{{Main|suspended load}}
Suspended load is carried in the lower to middle parts of the flow, and moves at a large fraction of the mean flow velocity in the stream.

A common characterization of suspended sediment concentration in a flow is given by the Rouse Profile. This characterization works for the situation in which sediment concentration &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; at one particular elevation above the bed &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; can be quantified. It is given by the expression:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c_s}{c_0} = \left[\frac{z \left(h-z_0\right)}{z_0\left(h-z\right)}\right]^{-P/\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the elevation above the bed, &lt;math&gt;c_s&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of suspended sediment at that elevation, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the flow depth, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the Rouse number, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; relates the eddy viscosity for momentum &lt;math&gt;K_m&lt;/math&gt; to the eddy diffusivity for sediment, which is approximately equal to one.&lt;ref name="harris_sus_sed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vims.edu/~ckharris/MS698_03/lecture_09.pdf|title=Lecture 9: Suspended Sediment Transport II|last=Harris|first=Courtney K.|date=March 18, 2003|work=Sediment transport processes in coastal environments|accessdate=23 December 2009|location=[[Virginia Institute of Marine Science]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528054103/http://www.vims.edu/~ckharris/MS698_03/lecture_09.pdf|archivedate=28 May 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{K_s}{K_m} \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;

Experimental work has shown that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; ranges from 0.93 to 1.10 for sands and silts.&lt;ref name="moore_sus_sed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_21.pdf|title=Lecture 21—Suspended Sediment Transport|last=Moore|first=Andrew|work=Lecture Notes: Fluvial Sediment Transport|accessdate=25 December 2009|location=Kent State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rouse profile characterizes sediment concentrations because the Rouse number includes both turbulent mixing and settling under the weight of the particles. Turbulent mixing results in the net motion of particles from regions of high concentrations to low concentrations. Because particles settle downward, for all cases where the particles are not neutrally buoyant or sufficiently light that this settling velocity is negligible, there is a net negative concentration gradient as one goes upward in the flow. The Rouse Profile therefore gives the concentration profile that provides a balance between turbulent mixing (net upwards) of sediment and the downwards settling velocity of each particle.

===Bed material load===
Bed material load comprises the bed load and the portion of the suspended load that is sourced from the bed.

Three common bed material transport relations are the "Ackers-White",&lt;ref name="ackers-white"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ackers|first=P.|author2=White, W.R. |year=1973|title=Sediment Transport: New Approach and Analysis|journal=[[Journal of the Hydraulics Division]]|publisher=[[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]]|volume=99|issue=11|pages=2041–2060|url=http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?7300122}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Engelund-Hansen", "Yang" formulae. The first is for [[sand]] to [[Granule (geology)|granule]]-size gravel, and the second and third are for sand&lt;ref name="bm_eval"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ariffin|first=J. |author2=A.A. Ghani |author3=N.A. Zakaira |author4=A.H. Yahya|date=14–16 October 2002|title=Evaluation of equations on total bed material load|journal=International Conference on Urban Hydrology for the 21st Century|location=[[Kuala Lumpur]]|url=http://redac.eng.usm.my/html/publish/2002_07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Yang later expanded his formula to include fine gravel. That all of these formulae cover the sand-size range and two of them are exclusively for sand is that the sediment in sand-bed rivers is commonly moved simultaneously as bed and suspended load.

====Engelund-Hansen====

The bed material load formula of Engelund and Hansen is the only one to not include some kind of critical value for the initiation of sediment transport. It reads:

:&lt;math&gt;q_s* = \frac{0.05}{c_f} \tau*^{2.5} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q_s*&lt;/math&gt; is the Einstein nondimensionalization for sediment volumetric discharge per unit width, &lt;math&gt;c_f&lt;/math&gt; is a friction factor, and &lt;math&gt;\tau*&lt;/math&gt; is the Shields stress. The Engelund-Hansen formula is one of the few sediment transport formulae in which a threshold "critical shear stress" is absent.

===Wash load===
Wash load is carried within the water column as part of the flow, and therefore moves with the mean velocity of main stream. Wash load concentrations are approximately uniform in the water column. This is described by the endmember case in which the Rouse number is equal to 0 (i.e. the settling velocity is far less than the turbulent mixing velocity), which leads to a prediction of a perfectly uniform vertical concentration profile of material.

===Total load===
Some authors have attempted formulations for the total sediment load carried in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=C|title=Unit stream power equations for total load|journal=Journal of Hydrology|volume=40|page=123|year=1979|doi=10.1016/0022-1694(79)90092-1|bibcode = 1979JHyd...40..123Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bailard|first1=James A.|title=An Energetics Total Load Sediment Transport Model For a Plane Sloping Beach|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=86|page=10938|year=1981|doi=10.1029/JC086iC11p10938|bibcode=1981JGR....8610938B}}&lt;/ref&gt; These formulas are designed largely for sand, as (depending on flow conditions) sand often can be carried as both bed load and suspended load in the same stream or shoreface.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5499">'''Spherical astronomy''' or '''positional astronomy''' is the branch of [[astronomy]] that is used to determine the location of objects on the [[celestial sphere]], as seen at a particular date, time, and location on [[Earth]]. It relies on the mathematical methods of [[spherical geometry]] and the measurements of [[astrometry]].

This is the oldest branch of astronomy and dates back to [[ancient history|antiquity]]. Observations of [[celestial objects]] have been, and continue to be, important for religious and [[astrology|astrological]] purposes, as well as for [[timekeeping]] and [[navigation]]. The science of actually measuring positions of celestial objects in the sky is known as astrometry.

The primary elements of spherical astronomy are coordinate systems and time. The coordinates of objects on the sky are listed using the [[equatorial coordinate system]], which is based on the projection of Earth's [[equator]] onto the celestial sphere. The position of an object in this system is given in terms of [[right ascension]] (α) and [[declination]] (δ). The latitude and local time can then be used to derive the position of the object in the [[horizontal coordinate system]], consisting of the [[altitude]] and [[azimuth]].

The coordinates of celestial objects such as stars and galaxies are tabulated in a [[star catalog]], which gives the position for a particular year. However, the combined effects of [[precession]] and [[nutation]] will cause the coordinates to change slightly over time. The effects of these changes in the movement of Earth are compensated by the periodic publication of revised catalogs.

To determine the position of the [[Sun]] and planets, an astronomical [[ephemeris]] (a table of values that gives the positions of astronomical objects in the sky at a given time) is used, which can then be converted into suitable real-world coordinates.

The unaided human eye can detect about 6000 [[star]]s, of which about half are below the horizon at any one time. On modern star charts, the [[celestial sphere]] is divided into 88 [[constellation]]s. Every star lies within a constellation. Constellations are useful for navigation. [[Polaris]] lies close to due north to an observer in the northern hemisphere. This star is always at a position nearly over the [[North Pole]].

== Positional phenomena ==
* Planets which are in [[astronomical conjunction|conjunction]] form a line which passes through the center of the [[Solar System]].
* The [[ecliptic]] is the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] which contains the orbit of a planet, usually in reference to [[Earth]].
* [[Elongation (astronomy)|Elongation]] refers to the [[angle]] formed by a planet, with respect to the system's center and a viewing [[Point (geometry)|point]].
** A [[Quadrature (astronomy)|quadrature]] occurs when the position of a body (moon or planet) is such that its elongation is 90° or 270°; i.e. the body-earth-sun angle is 90°
* [[inferior and superior planets|Superior planets]] have a larger [[orbit]] than Earth's, while the [[inferior and superior planets|inferior planets]] (Mercury and Venus) orbit the Sun inside Earth's orbit.
* A [[transit (astronomy)|transit]] may occur when an inferior planet passes through a point of conjunction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7080">'''Spurious trip level''' (STL) is defined as a discrete level for specifying the spurious trip requirements of safety functions to be allocated to safety systems. An STL of 1 means that this safety function has the highest level of spurious trips. The higher the STL level the lower the number of spurious trips caused by the safety system. There is no limit to the number of spurious trip levels.

Safety functions and systems are installed to protect people, the environment and for asset protection. A safety function should only activate when a dangerous situation occurs. A safety function that activates without the presence of a dangerous situation (e.g., due to an internal failure) causes economic loss. The spurious trip level concept represents the probability that safety function causes a spurious (unscheduled) trip.

The STL is a metric that is used to specify the performance level of a safety function in terms of the spurious trips it potentially causes. Typical safety systems that benefit from an STL level are defined in standards like [[IEC 61508]]&lt;ref&gt;IEC 61508: Functional safety of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic safety-related systems, IEC, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; [[IEC 61511]],&lt;ref&gt;IEC 61511 - Functional safety - Safety instrumented systems for the process industry sector, IEC, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; IEC 62061,&lt;ref&gt;Safety of machinery - Functional safety of safety-related electrical, electronic and programmable electronic control systems, IEC, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; ISA S84,&lt;ref&gt;ANSI/ISA-84.00.01-2004 Part 1 (IEC 61511-1 Mod) Functional Safety: Safety Instrumented Systems for the Process Industry Sector&lt;/ref&gt; EN 50204&lt;ref&gt;EN 50204 - Electrical apparatus for the detection and measurement of combustible or toxic gases or vapours or of oxygen. Requirements on the functional safety of fixed gas detection systems&lt;/ref&gt; and so on. An STL provides end-users of safety functions with a measurable attribute that helps them define the desired availability of their safety functions. An STL can be specified for a complete safety loop or for individual devices.

For end-users there is always a potential conflict between the cost of safety solutions and the loss of profitability caused by spurious trips of these safety solutions. The STL concept helps the end-users to end this conflict in a way that safety solutions provide both the desired safety and the desired process availability.

== STL determination ==
The spurious trip level represents asset loss due to an internal failure of the safety function. The more financial damage the safety function can cause due to a spurious trip the higher the STL level of the safety function should be. Each company needs to decide for themselves which level of financial loss they can or are willing to take. This actually depends on many different factors including the financial strength of the company, the insurance policy they have, the cost of process shutdown and startup, and so on. All these factors are unique to each company. The table below shows an example of how a company can calibrate its spurious trip levels.

== STL levels ==
The STL level achieved by a safety function is determined by the probability of fail safe (PFS) of this safety function. The PFS value is determined by internal failures of the safety system that cause the safety function to be executed without a demand from the process. The table below demonstrates the PFS value and spurious trip reduction values of each STL level.

== STL vs SIL ==
Today standards only define the [[safety integrity level]] (SIL) for safety functions. Standards do not define STL levels because they do in first instance not represent safety but economic loss. Despite this the STL is also a safety attribute, specially for safety functions in the process, oil &amp; gas, chemical and nuclear industry. In those industries an undesired shutdown of the process leads to dangerous situation as the plant needs to be started up again. Startup and shutdown of a process plant are considered the two most dangerous operational modes of the plant and should be limited to the absolute minimum.

In practice the STL and SIL concepts complement each other. Both factors are attributes of the same safety function. The STL level is determined by the average PFS value of the safety function. The SIL level is determined by the average probability of failure on demand. PFD value of the safety function. The STL level expresses the probability of spurious trips by the safety function, i.e., the safety function is executed without a demand from the process. The SIL level expresses the probability that the safety function does not work upon demand from the process. Both parameters are important to end-users in order to achieve safety and asset protection.

In order to calculate the PFS or PFD value of a safety loop it is necessary to have a reliability model and reliability data for each component in the safety loop. The best reliability model to use is a Markov model (see [[Andrey Markov]]). Typical data required are:
* Lambda safe detected
* Lambda safe undetected
* Lambda dangerous detected
* Lambda dangerous undetected
* Repair rate
* Proof test coverage
* Proof test interval
* Common cause factors

'''''The Sleeper Awakes''''' (1910) is a [[dystopia]]n [[science fiction]] novel by English writer [[H. G. Wells]], about a man who sleeps for two hundred and three years, waking up in a completely transformed London where he has become the richest man in the world. The main character awakes to see his dreams realised, and the future revealed to him in all its horrors and malformities.

The novel is a rewritten version of '''''When the Sleeper Wakes''''', a story by Wells that was serialised between 1898 and 1899.

==Publication history==
The novel was originally published, as ''When the Sleeper Wakes'', in ''[[The Graphic]]'' from 1898 to 1903 and illustrated by H. Lanos.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Alan K. ed. The Collector's Book of Science Fiction by H. G. Wells. Castle Books; New Jersey, 1978. Pg 364&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfied with its original form, Wells, who was an outspoken socialist and author of [[prophecy|prophetic]] writings, rewrote it in 1910. "Like most of my earlier work", he wrote in the 1910 edition's preface, "it was written under considerable pressure; there are marks of haste not only in the writing of the latter part, but in the very construction of the story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wells |year=1910 |title=The Sleeper Awakes |chapter=Preface |url=http://www.readbookonline.net/read/11017/27891/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short story "[[A Story of the Days To Come]]" (1897) is a forerunner of the novel, being a tale set within the same future society.

Graham, an Englishman  living in [[London]]  in 1897 takes drugs to cure  [[insomnia]] and falls into a coma.  He  wakes up in 2100. He later learns that  he has inherited huge wealth and that his money has been put into a trust. Over the years, the trustees, the "White Council", have used his wealth to establish a vast political and economic world order.

When he wakes Graham  is disoriented. The people around him had not expected him to wake up, and are alarmed. Word spreads  that the "Sleeper" has  awakened. A mob gathers around  the building and   demands to see the fabled Sleeper.  The people around Graham will not answer his questions.  They place Graham  under [[house arrest]]. Graham learns that he is the legal owner and master of most of the world.

Rebels led by Ostrog help Graham to escape.  They say that the people need Graham's leadership to  rise against the White Council. Unconvinced, but unwilling to remain a prisoner, Graham goes with them.   Graham arrives at a massive hall where the workers  have gathered to prepare for the revolution.  They  march against the White Council but are soon attacked by the state police.  In the confusion, Graham is separated from the revolutionaries.  He meets an old man who tells him the story of the Sleeper - the White Council invested his wealth to buy the industries and political entities of half the world, establishing a [[plutocracy]] and sweeping away parliament and the monarchy. The Sleeper is just a  figurehead.  The old man   thinks that the Sleeper is  a made-up figure used to brainwash the population.

Graham meets  Ostrog, who says  that the rebels have won and that the people  are demanding that  the Sleeper should rule.   Ostrog retains power while Graham becomes his puppet ruler. Graham  gets interested in aeroplanes and learns how to fly. He sees from the air that no-one lives in the country or small towns any more, all agriculture being run like industry;  and that there are now only four huge cities in Britain, all powered by huge wind-mills. His carefree life  ends when  Helen Wotton tells him  that for the lower class the revolution has changed nothing.  Graham  questions Ostrog  who  admits that the lower classes are still dominated and exploited but defends the system. It emerges that Ostrog only wanted to take power for himself and has used the revolution and Graham to do so.

Ostrog admits  that in other cities the workers have continued to rebel even after the fall of the White Council.  Ostrog has used a black  African police force to get the workers back in line. Graham is furious  and demands that Ostrog keep his police out of London. Ostrog agrees. Graham decides to examine this new society for himself.

Graham  visits London in disguise to see how the workers live.  Their lives are ghastly. Unskilled workers  toil in factories, paid in food for each day's work, with no job security. They  speak a dialect so strong that Graham cannot understand them. Industrial diseases are rife.  Workers wear uniforms of different colour according to their trade.  The family unit no longer exists and children are cared for in huge institutions. Lives are dominated by "babble machines" which spread news and "pleasure cities" where unspecified joys are available.  "Euthanasy" is considered normal.

Graham learns that Ostrog has ordered his troops to London.  Graham confronts Ostrog, who tries to arrest Graham. The workers rise up again and help  Graham to escape. He meets Helen and learns that it was she who told the public about Ostrog's treachery. Graham leads the liberation of London.

Ostrog  escapes and joins his troops who are flying to London.  His men still hold a few airports. The workers find anti-aircraft guns, but they need time to set them up. The revolutionaries have only one aircraft; Graham gives away all of his wealth to the rebels and proceeds to fly the one aircraft against the invaders, bringing some of them down. The revolutionaries get the anti-aircraft guns working and start to shoot down the invaders. Graham attacks  Ostrog's aeroplane but fails.  Graham's aeroplane  crashes.

==Themes==
Themes include socialism; the betrayal of revolution; and how an elite can manipulate a population both by oppression and impoverishment on the one hand, and by the use of technology and provision of pleasure on the other. In this respect, the book has elements explored later both in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]] and ''[[Brave New World]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]].

==Reception==
[[Floyd C. Gale]] of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' said of ''The Sleeper Awakes'' despite the "impossibly timid" and outdated science, "The worth of the story lies in its human values ... This is 'Young Wells' at his non-Utopian best".&lt;ref name="gale196004"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Gale |first=Floyd C. |date=April 1960 |title=Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v18n04_1960-04#page/n71/mode/1up |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=142–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Aspects of the novel's storyline are similar to the plot of the [[Woody Allen]] 1973 film ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;James Robert Parish, Michael R. Pitts. ''The great science fiction pictures: Volume 1'', Scarecrow Press, 1977. Pg. 298: "Iconoclastic film star /filmmaker Woody Allen turned his comedic genius to a satirical look into the future with a storyline that owes a nod of gratitude to HG Wells' When the Sleeper Awakes."&lt;/ref&gt;

Pulp writer [[Harry Stephen Keeler]] took the idea further in a 1914 story called "John Jones' Dollar", in which a solar system's economy is built around a single silver dollar left to accumulate until the year 2921 to the "astounding" sum of $6.3 trillion, financing an interplanetary socialist paradise.

The ''[[Futurama]]'' episode "[[A Fishful of Dollars]]" is loosely based upon Wells's novel. Fry discovers that his bank account has continued to accrue interest over the course of a thousand years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4165">In [[metrology]] and the fields that it serves (such as [[manufacturing]], [[machining]], and [[engineering]]), '''total indicator reading''' ('''TIR'''), also known by the newer name '''full indicator movement''' ('''FIM'''), is the difference between the maximum and minimum [[measurement]]s, that is, readings of an [[indicator (distance amplifying instrument)|indicator]], on the [[plane (geometry)|planar]], [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]], or contoured surface of a part,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engineersedge.com/engineering/Engineering_Terms_Glossary/T/total_indicator_reading_tir_4448.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729021818/http://www.engineersedge.com/engineering/Engineering_Terms_Glossary/T/total_indicator_reading_tir_4448.htm |archivedate=2012-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; showing its amount of deviation from flatness, roundness (circularity), cylindricity, concentricity with other cylindrical features, or similar conditions. The indicator traditionally would be a dial indicator; today dial-type and digital indicators coexist. 

The earliest expansion of "TIR" was '''total indicated run-out''' and concerned cylindrical or tapered (conical) parts, where "[[run-out]]" (noun) refers to any imperfection of form that causes a [[rotation around a fixed axis|rotating]] part such as a shaft to "run out" (verb), that is, to not rotate with perfect smoothness. These conditions include being out-of-round (that is, lacking sufficient [[roundness (object)|roundness]]); eccentricity (that is, lacking sufficient [[concentric|concentricity]]); or being bent axially (regardless of whether the surfaces are perfectly round and concentric at every cross-sectional point). The purpose of emphasizing the "total" in TIR was to duly maintain the distinction between per-side differences and both-sides-considered differences, which requires perennial conscious attention in [[lathe (metal)|lathe]] work. For example, all depths of cut in lathe work must account for whether they apply to the radius (that is, per side) or to the diameter (that is, total). Similarly, in shaft-straightening operations, where calibrated amounts of bending force are applied laterally to the shaft, the "total" emphasis corresponds to a bend of half that magnitude. If a shaft has 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm TIR, it is "out of straightness" by half that total, i.e., 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm. 

Today TIR in its more inclusive expansion, "total indicator reading", concerns all kinds of features, from round to flat to contoured. One example of how the "total" emphasis can apply to flat surfaces as well as round ones is in the topic of [[surface roughness]], where both peaks and valleys count toward an assessment of the magnitude of roughness. Statistical methods such as [[root mean square]] (RMS) duly address the "total" idea in this respect.

The newer name "full indicator movement" (FIM) was coined to emphasize the requirement of zero [[Indicator (distance amplifying instrument)#Dial test indicator tips|cosine error]]. Whereas dial test indicators will give a foreshortened reading if their tips are on an angle to the surface being measured (cosine error), a drawing callout of FIM is defined as referring to the distance traveled by the extremity of the tip—not by the lesser amount that its lever-like action moves the needle. Thus a FIM requirement is only met when the measured part itself is truly in geometric compliance—not merely when the needle sweeps a certain arc of the dial. 

The "TIR" abbreviation is still more widely known and used than "FIM". This is natural given that (1) many part designs that are still being manufactured are made from decades-old [[engineering drawing]]s, which still say "TIR"; and (2) generations of machinists were trained with the term "TIR", whereas only recent curriculum uses "FIM".
