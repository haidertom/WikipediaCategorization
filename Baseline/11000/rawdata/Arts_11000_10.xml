{{About|literary use of the phrase|1917 painting by Paul Klee|Ab ovo (painting)|biological alternative to spontaneous generation|Omne vivum ex ovo}}
[[File:Leda and the Swan 1505-1510.jpg|thumb|''Leda and the Swan'', a painting depicting Helen's unconventional birth, by [[Cesare da Sesto]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1506&amp;ndash;1510, [[Wilton, Wiltshire|Wilton]]) after a lost painting by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Helen and [[Clytemnestra]] are shown emerging from one egg; [[Castor and Pollux]] from another.]]
'''''Ab ovo''''' ([[Latin]]: "from the beginning, the origin, the [[egg (biology)|egg]]") is a reference to one of the twin eggs from which [[Helen of Troy#Birth|Helen of Troy was born]]. The eggs were laid by [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] after mating with [[Zeus]] disguised as a swan. Had [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]] not laid the egg, [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] would not have been born, so [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] could not have eloped with her, so there would have been no [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;Helen of Troy: From Homer to Hollywood. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. Chichester, West Sussex, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature ==

The [[English language|English]] literary use of the phrase comes from [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', where he describes his ideal epic poet as one who "does not begin the Trojan War from the double egg" (''nec gemino bellum Troianum orditur ab ouo''), the absolute beginning of events, the earliest possible chronological point, but snatches the listener into the middle of things (''[[in medias res]]''). This advice is famously rejected in [[Laurence Sterne]]'s novel [[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]].

This use is distinct from the longer phrase ''[[ab ovo usque ad mala]]'' (lit. "from the egg to the apples") which appears in Horace's [[Sermonum liber primus|''Satire'']] 1.3.  It refers to the course of a Roman meal, which often began with eggs and ended with fruit, and is similar to the American English phrase "[[wikt:from soup to nuts#Adverb|soup to nuts]]".  Thus ''ab ovo'' can also be used to mean a complete or entire thing.

{{Main article|Genre fiction}}

'''Action fiction''' is the [[literary genre]] that includes [[Spy fiction|spy novels]], [[Adventure fiction|adventure]] stories, tales of terror and intrigue ("[[cloak and dagger]]"), and [[Mystery fiction|mysteries]].  This kind of story utilizes [[Thriller (genre)|suspense]], the tension that is built up when the reader wishes to know how the [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]] between the [[protagonist]] and [[antagonist]] is going to be resolved or what the solution to the puzzle of a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1999|pp=58,116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre fiction==
Action fiction is a form of [[genre fiction]] whose subject matter is characterized by emphasis on exciting [[Action (narrative)|action]] sequences. This does not always mean they exclude character development or story-telling.  Action fiction is related to other forms of [[fiction]], including [[action film]]s, [[action game]]s and analogous media in other formats such as [[manga]] and [[anime]]. It  includes martial arts action, extreme sports action, car chases and vehicles, suspense action, and action [[comedy]], with each focusing in more detail on its own type and flavor of action. It is usually possible to tell from the creative style of an action sequence, the emphasis of an entire work, so that, for example, the style of a combat sequence will indicate whether the entire work can be classified as action adventure, or a martial work. Action is mainly defined by a central focus on any kind of exciting movement.

== History ==

In 1893, a group of American [[architect]]s, [[Painting|painters]] and [[sculptor]]s met regularly while planning the fine arts section of the [[1893 World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]]. The group discussed the idea of forming an American school for artists in Europe as a place for American artists to study and further their skills. Led by [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles F. McKim]] of architectural practice [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]], they decided that Rome, which they considered a veritable museum of masterpieces of painting, sculpture and architecture throughout the ages, would be the best location for the school. The program began with institutions such as [[Columbia University]] and [[University of Pennsylvania]], who would provide scholarships to artists to fund their travel to Rome. In October 1894 the American School of Architecture opened temporarily at the [[Palazzo Torlonia]]; directed by [[Austin W. Lord]], it had three fellows, one visiting student, and a library with one volume. In July 1895, the program moved into the larger Villa Aurora. Renting space out to the American School of Classical Studies and the British &amp; American Archeological Society Library, and financial contributions from McKim, allowed for the school to remain open.&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite web | author=| year=2011 | title=Finding Aid | work=American Academy in Rome records, 1855-[ca.1981], (bulk dates 1894-1946) | publisher=[[Archives of American Art]] | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/american-academy-rome-records-6320/more | accessdate=17 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, the American School of Architecture in Rome was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] state and 10 shares of [[capital stock]] were issued. Despite fund-raising efforts and the American School of Classical Studies pulling out of Villa Aurora, the organization struggled financially. McKim made up for the financial loss with his personal funds. These struggles would cause the American School of Architecture to restructure and base their program on the [[French Academy in Rome|French Academy]]. In June 1897, the institution dissolved itself and formed the American Academy in Rome.&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt; Among its incorporators was [[Charles Moore (businessman)|Charles Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;Caemmerer, H. Paul. "Charles Moore and the Plan of Washington." ''Records of the Columbia Historical Society.'' Vol. 46/47 (1944/1945): 237-258, 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy introduced bills to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] to make it a "national institution," which was successful.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Brown [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030974136;seq=9;view=1up;num=I ''1860-1930: Memories''] (Washington DC, 1931), pp. 425-28)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the Academy moved into Villa Mirafiore, which was soon purchased and renovated. They formed an [[Financial endowment|endowment]], which raised over a million dollars, designating those having donated over $100,000 as founders. These founders included: McKim, [[Harvard College]], [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|The Carnegie Foundation]], [[J.P. Morgan]], [[J.P. Morgan, Jr.]], [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], [[The Rockefeller Foundation]], [[William K. Vanderbilt]], [[Henry Walters]], and others.&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt; Ever since, the American Academy has always been primarily privately financed.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Jean Nathan (June 9, 1994), [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/garden/in-rome-renovation-worthy-of-the-medici.html In Rome, Renovation Worthy of the Medici] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, financing comes from private donations as well as grants from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/11/arts/american-academy-gives-1991-rome-prizes.html American Academy Gives 1991 Rome Prizes] ''The New York Times'', April 11, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, the American School of Classical Studies in Rome merged with the Academy, giving the Academy two wings: one that focuses on [[fine art]] and one, [[classical studies]]. Women were a part of the School of Classical Studies, but were not permitted participation in the School of Fine Arts until after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt; Since 1914, [[Joseph Brodsky]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Nadine Gordimer]], [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Frank Stella]], [[William Styron]], [[Michael Graves]], [[Robert Venturi]], [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[Oscar Hijuelos]] and [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], among others, have come to the Academy for inspiration.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32510561 ''Centennial Directory of the American Academy in Rome''] documented the lives and careers of nearly 1,400 Fellows and Residents of the Academy from the Academy's founding in 1894 to its centenary in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;American Academy in Rome., Kohl, B. G., Linker, W. A., Kavelman, B. S., &amp; American Academy in Rome. (1995). ''The centennial directory of the American Academy in Rome.'' New York: American Academy in Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
From 1970 to 1973, art historian Bartlett H.

She also brought on [[Alice Waters]] to create the Rome Sustainable Food Project, which brings chefs from the United States to explore Italian sustainable food traditions and to cook for the Academy guests.

From 2010 to 2014, [[Christopher Celenza]] was director of the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://aarome.org/it/news/features/american-academy-in-rome-appoints-christopher-celenza-its-21st-director|title=American Academy in Rome Appoints Christopher Celenza its 21st Director|last=|first=|date=13 December 2009|work=Funzionalità|access-date=23 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624021228/http://aarome.org/it/news/features/american-academy-in-rome-appoints-christopher-celenza-its-21st-director|archive-date=24 June 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by Kimberly Bowes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wantedinrome.com/news/new-director-of-american-academy-in-rome.html|title=New director of American Academy in Rome|last=|first=|date=4 March 2014|work=[[Wanted in Rome]]|access-date=23 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624021453/https://www.wantedinrome.com/news/new-director-of-american-academy-in-rome.html|archive-date=24 June 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Robbins became president and CEO of the Academy in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Donadio (October 30, 2013), [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/american-academy-in-rome-names-new-president/ American Academy in Rome Names New President] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
The Academy serves as a "home" to visiting U.S. scholars and artists having been awarded the [[Rome Prize]]. Given each year to up to 30 (15 artist and 15 scholars) of more than 1,000 applicants,&lt;ref&gt;http://cdn.aarome.org/html-emails/pdf/AARMagazine_Spring2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Rome Prize is awarded for work in the following fields: [[classical studies]], [[ancient|ancient studies]], [[Medieval|medieval studies]], modern [[Italian culture|Italian]] studies, [[architecture]], [[design]], [[historic preservation]], [[art conservation]], [[landscape architecture]], [[musical composition]], [[visual art]], and [[literature]]. The Rome Prize includes terms that range from six months to two years fellowships at the academy; a stipend ($16,000 for six month and $28,000 for one year fellowships); and work and living space at the 11-acre campus.

In addition to Rome Prize Fellows, visiting scholars and artists live and/or work at the Academy for varying periods.&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt;

== Site ==

The Academy is housed in several buildings.  The main building was designed by the firm of [[McKim, Mead, and White]] and opened in 1914. Located under the floor of the basement of the main building lies a segment of the [[Aqua Traiana]] that was discovered in 1912-1913.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4238499] The courtyard has a fountain designed by sculptor [[Paul Manship]]. Architect [[Michael Graves]] designed the rare books library in 1996.

The Academy also owns the ''[[Villa Aurelia]]'',&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt; a country estate built for [[Cardinal Girolamo Farnese]] in 1650.  The building served as [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s headquarters during the French siege of Rome in 1849.  The villa was heavily damaged during the assault, but it was restored.  It was then purchased by [[Philadelphia]] heiress [[Clara Jessup Heyland]].  Heyland died in 1909, bequeathing the villa to the Academy in her will.&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt;

==Archaeology==
A portion of the [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] [[Aqua Traiana]] and the ruins of the [[watermills]] fed by the aqueduct are on the grounds of the Academy.  From the third to the sixth century CE, the Aqua Traiana carried water to operate a number of water mills used for grinding grain, mostly wheat, into flour to make bread, the most important item in the Roman diet. The ancient city of Rome had to import large amounts of grain from [[Egypt]], [[North Africa]], and [[Sicily]] to feed its population, estimated at about one million people at its peak. The mills on Janiculum Hill and on the site of the Academy were the second largest complex of water mills known in the ancient world. The provision of grain to the residents of Rome was called the [[Cura Annonae]]. The aqueduct and the watermills were excavated in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Andrew (2000), "The Water-Mills on the Janiculum", ''Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome,'' Vol. 45, pp. 219-246.

'''Archival research''' is a type of research which involves seeking out and extracting [[evidence]] from [[archive|archival]] [[document|records]]. These records may be held either in collecting institutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ciscra.org/mat/mat/term/64|title=Multilingual Archival Terminology|last=International Council on Archives|first=|date=|website=International Council on Archives|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as libraries and museums, or in the custody of the organization (whether a government body, business, family, or other agency) that originally generated or accumulated them, or in that of a successor body (transferring, or in-house archives).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/i/institutional-archives|title=A glossary of archival and records terminology|last=Society of American Archivists|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archival research can be contrasted with (1) [[secondary research]] (undertaken in a [[library]] or [[Internet research|online]]), which involves identifying and consulting [[secondary source]]s relating to the topic of enquiry; and (2) with other types of primary research and [[Empirical method|empirical investigation]] such as [[Field research|fieldwork]] and [[experiment]].

==History of archives organizations==
The oldest archives have been in existence for hundreds of years. For instance, the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] was started in the 17th century AD and contains state papers, papal account books, and papal correspondence dating back to the 8th century. Most archives that are still in existence do not claim collections that date back quite as far as the Vatican Archive. The [[Archives nationales|Archives Nationales]] in France was founded in 1790 during the French Revolution and has holdings that date back to AD 625, and other European archives have a similar provenance. Archives in the modern world, while of more recent date, may also hold material going back several centuries, for example the United States [[National Archives and Records Administration]] was established originally in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Archive.gov. National Records and Archive Administration, 1 December 2009. Web. 5 December 2009 &lt;https://www.archives.gov/research/start/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The NARA contains records and collections dating back to the founding of the United States in the 18th century. Among the collections of the NARA are the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and an original copy of the Magna Carta. The [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|British National Archives (TNA)]] traces its history to the creation of the [[Public Record Office]] in 1838, while other state and national bodies were also formed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 

Universities are another venue for archival holdings and manuscript collections. Most universities have archival holdings that chronicle the business of the university. Some universities also have archives or manuscript collections that focus on one aspect or another of the culture of the state or country in which the university is located. Museums and local history centers may also be good sources for archival materials.

The reason for highlighting the breadth and depth of historical archives is to give some idea of the difficulties facing archival researchers. Some of these archives hold vast quantities of records. For example, the Vatican Secret Archive has upwards of 52 miles of archival shelving. An increasing number of archives are now accepting digital transfers, which can also present challenges for display and access.

== Archival research methodologies ==
Archival research lies at the heart of most academic and other forms of original [[Historical method|historical research]]; but it is frequently also undertaken (in conjunction with parallel research methodologies) in other disciplines within the [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s, including [[Literary criticism|literary studies]], rhetoric&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L'Eplattenier|first=Barbara E.|date=2009|title=An Argument for Archival Research Methods: Thinking Beyond Methodology|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25653008|journal=College English|volume=72|issue=1|pages=67–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[archaeology]], [[sociology]], [[human geography]], [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], and [[organizational studies]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It may also be important in other non-academic types of enquiry, such as the [[Adoption#Reunion|tracing of birth families by adoptees]], and [[criminal investigation]]s. Data held by archival institutions is also of use in scientific research and in establishing civil rights.

In addition to discipline, the kind of research [[methodology]] used in archival research can vary depending on its organization and its materials. For example, in an archives that has a large number of materials still unprocessed, a researcher may find consulting directly with archive staff who have a clear understanding of collections and their organization to be useful as they can be a source of information regarding unprocessed materials or of related materials in other archives and repositories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/613205862|title=Working in the archives : practical research methods for rhetoric and composition|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|others=Ramsey, Alexis E., 1979-|year=|isbn=9781441645975|location=Carbondale|pages=82-83|oclc=613205862}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an archive is not entirely oriented towards one or relevant to a single discipline, researchers, for example [[Genealogy|genealogists]], may rely upon formal or informal networks to support research by sharing information about specific archives' organization and collections with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duff|first=Wendy|last2=Johnson|first2=Catherine|date=2003|title=Where Is the List with All the Names? Information-Seeking Behavior of Genealogists|url=https://doi.org/10.17723/aarc.66.1.l375uj047224737n|journal=The American Archivist|language=en-US|volume=66|issue=1|pages=79–95|doi=10.17723/aarc.66.1.l375uj047224737n|issn=0360-9081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elizabeth|first=Yakel,|date=2004|title=Seeking Information, Seeking Connections, Seeking Meaning: Genealogists and Family Historians.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1082067|journal=Information Research: An International Electronic Journal|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|issn=1368-1613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conducting research at an archive ==
[[File:Hoover-Archive-Reading-Room.jpg|thumb|The [[Hoover Institution Library and Archives]] Reading Room. A reading room is a space at an archive where users can consult materials under staff supervision.]]
Archival research is generally more complex and time-consuming than [[secondary research]], presenting challenges in identifying, locating and interpreting relevant documents. Although archives share similar features and characteristics they can also vary in significant ways. While publicly funded archives may have mandates that require them to be as accessible as possible other kinds, such as corporate, religious, or private archives, will have varying degrees of access and discoverability.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Welch|first=Catherine|date=2000|title=The archaeology of business networks: the use of archival records in case study research|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0965254X.2000.10815560|journal=Journal of Strategic Marketing|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=197–208|doi=10.1080/0965254x.2000.10815560|issn=0965-254X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some materials may be restricted in other ways, such as on those containing [[Information sensitivity|sensitive]] or [[Classified information|classified]] information, unpublished works, or imposed by agreements with the donor of materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://siarchives.si.edu/what-we-do/collections-access-policies#policies|title=Collections Access Policies|last=Anonymous|date=2012-04-26|work=Smithsonian Institution Archives|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/declassification/ndc/restricted-records.html|title=General Information about Restricted Records|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/publications/brochures/copyright-and-unpublished-material|title=Copyright and Unpublished Material {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, archival records are often unique, and the researcher must be prepared to travel to reach them. Even when materials are available in digital formats there may be restrictions on them that prohibit them from being accessed off-site.

=== Locating archival collections ===
Prior to online search, [[Union catalog|union catalogs]] were an important tool for finding materials in libraries and archives. In the United States, the [[National Union Catalog]] and the [[NUCMC|National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections]] have been used by researchers to locate archives although much of its information has since been migrated to online systems. 

An increasing number of archival institutions can be found via an online search. In addition, portals such as [[Europeana]], the [[Digital Public Library of America]] and the [[National Library of Australia]]'s [[Trove]] provide links to member institutions. 

In the UK, [[Jisc|JISC]] hosts the [https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/ ArchivesHub], while the [[OCLC]]'s [https://www.oclc.org/research/themes/research-collections/archivegrid.html ArchiveGrid] provides an international portal for mostly library based institutions, which use [[MARC standards|MARC]] as a cataloguing tool for their holdings. The [[Association of Canadian Archivists]] (ACA) has partnered with the software company [https://www.artefactual.com/ Artefactual] to create [http://www.archivescanada.ca/ ArchivesCanada], while the [[Australian Society of Archivists]] have used the same software for their [https://directory.archivists.org.au/ Directory of Archives in Australia]. Many other online search tools have been made available to facilitate search and discovery

If an archives cannot be found through online search or a publicly listed collection a researcher may have to track down its existence through other means, such as following other researcher's citations and references. This is particularly true for materials held by corporations or other organizations that may not employ an archivist and thus be unaware of the extent or contents of their materials.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

In very restricted archives, access may be restricted only to individuals with certain credentials or affiliations with institutions like universities and then only to those of a certain level. Those lacking the necessary credentials may need to request letters of introduction from an individual or institution to provide to the archive. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28668848|title=Archival strategies and techniques|last=R.|first=Hill, Michael|date=1993|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=0803948247|location=Newbury Park|oclc=28668848}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Locating materials within archives ===
Archives usually contain unique materials and their organization may also be entirely unique or idiosyncratic to the institution or organization that maintains them. This is one important distinction with libraries where material is organized according to [[Library classification|standardized classification systems]]. Traditionally, archives have followed the principle of ''[[respect des fonds]]'' in which the [[provenance]] and [[original order]] is maintained although some rearrangement, physical or intellectual, may be done by the archivist to facilitate its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/alic/reference/archives-resources/principles-of-arrangement.html|title=Archives and Records Management Resources|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scaa.usask.ca/rad/section1.htm|title=1. What are Arrangement and Description?|website=scaa.usask.ca|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Finding aid|Finding aids]] are a common reference tool created by archivists for locating materials. They come in a variety of forms, such as registers, card catalogs, or inventories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/f/finding-aid|title=finding aid {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many finding aids to archival documents are now hosted online as web pages or uploaded as documents, such as at the [[Library of Congress]]' [https://www.loc.gov/rr/rarebook/findaid/findaid.html Rare Book &amp; Special Collections].  The level of detail in finding aids can vary from granular item-level descriptions to coarse collection-level descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/guides/archivedescriptions/|title=Archive Descriptions - Archives Hub|website=archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/l/level-of-description|title=level of description {{!}} Society of American Archivists|website=www2.archivists.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an archive has a large backlog of unprocessed materials, there may not be any kind of finding aid at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/613205862|title=Working in the archives : practical research methods for rhetoric and composition|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|others=Ramsey, Alexis E., 1979-|year=|isbn=9781441645975|location=Carbondale|pages=81|oclc=613205862}}&lt;/ref&gt; From around 2005, an ideology known as "[[More Product, Less Process]]", or MPLP, has been adopted by many archives seeking to reduce [[Archival processing|processing]] time or alleviate backlogs to provide access to materials sooner, the results of which may be minimally described finding aids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/613205862|title=Working in the archives : practical research methods for rhetoric and composition|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|others=Ramsey, Alexis E., 1979-|year=|isbn=9781441645975|location=Carbondale|pages=65-66|oclc=613205862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most archive repositories welcome researchers, and have [[archivist|professional staff]] tasked with assisting them, the large quantity of records means that finding aids may be of only limited usefulness: the researcher will need to hunt through large quantities of documents in search of material relevant to his or her particular enquiry. Some records may be closed to public access for reasons of [[confidentiality]]; and others may be written in [[Palaeography|archaic handwriting]], in ancient or foreign languages, or in technical terminology. Archival documents were generally created for immediate practical or administrative purposes, not for the benefit of future researchers, and additional contextual research may be necessary to make sense of them. Many of these challenges are exacerbated when the records are still in the custody of the generating body or in private hands, where owners or custodians may be unwilling to provide access to external enquirers, and where finding aids may be even more rudimentary or non-existent.

=== Consulting archival materials  ===
==== On-site ====
[[File:ResearchCenterPhotoByKirstenForWebsite960pxWide.jpg|alt=View of the reading room in the Maritime Research Center showing researchers, NPS uniformed staff as well as visitors, at tables consulting archives, books, and audio materials, Reference Librarian Gina Bardi at the Reference Desk in the background.|left|thumb|Reading Room of the [https://www.nps.gov/safr/learn/historyculture/research-center.htm Maritime Research Center, San Francisco]. In the foreground, a user is seated at a table and is consulting materials stored in [[Hollinger box|archival boxes]] which are brought to them by staff.]]
Archival materials are usually held in closed stacks and non-circulating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28668848|title=Archival strategies and techniques|last=R.|first=Hill, Michael|date=1993|publisher=Sage Publications|year=|isbn=0803948247|location=Newbury Park|pages=24|oclc=28668848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users request to see specific materials from the archives and may only consult them on-site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archives.library.ubc.ca/access-and-use-of-archival-materials/|title=Using the Archives {{!}} University Archives Blog|website=archives.library.ubc.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.harvard.edu/collections/archive-world-music|title=Archive of World Music|website=Harvard Library|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After locating the relevant record location using a finding aid or other discovery tool a user may then have to submit the request to the archives, such as using a request form.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nids.mod.go.jp/english/military_archives/index.html|title=Military Archives - The National Institute for Defense Studies|website=www.nids.mod.go.jp|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an archives has part of its holdings located in a separate building or facility, it make take days or weeks to retrieve materials, requiring a user to submit their requests in advance of an on-site consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/start/research-visit-faqs.html|title=Research Visit FAQs|date=2016-02-11|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Reading hall of the Norwegian National Archive (Gardmanahay).jpg|thumb|Reading room of the [[National Archives of Norway]]. In the foreground are [[Image scanner|flatbed scanners]]. Since archival materials are unique, some archives may have equipment available for users to duplicate materials.]]
A reading room is a space, usually within or near the archive, where users can consult archival materials under staff supervision. The unique, fragile, or sensitive nature of some materials sometimes requires the certain kinds of restrictions on their use, handling, and/or duplication. Many archives restrict what kinds of items can be brought into a reading room from outside, such as pencils, notepads, bags, and even clothing, to guard against theft or risk of damage to materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/visit-us/researching-here/can-take-reading-rooms/|title=What can I take into the reading rooms? - The National Archives|last=Archives|first=The National|work=The National Archives|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further restrictions may be placed on the number of materials that can be consulted at any given time, such as limiting a user to one box at a time and requiring all materials to be laid flat and visible at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/start/nara-regulations|title=Regulations for NARA Researchers|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some archives provide basic supplies including scrap paper and pencils or foam wedges for supporting unusually large materials.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/613205862|title=Working in the archives : practical research methods for rhetoric and composition|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|others=Ramsey, Alexis E., 1979-|year=|isbn=9781441645975|location=Carbondale|pages=|oclc=613205862}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duplication services may be available at the archive although the policies, costs, and time required can vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/december-2004/a-survival-guide-to-archival-research|title=A Survival Guide to Archival Research: {{!}} Perspectives on History {{!}} AHA|website=www.historians.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hoover.org/library-archives/collections/get-help/duplication-orders|title=Reproduction Orders|work=Hoover Institution|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, archives also allow users to use their own devices, such as handheld cameras, cell phones, and even scanners, to duplicate materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/dc/researcher-info|title=Information for Researchers|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some materials may contain information that concerns the [[privacy]] and [[confidentiality]] of living individuals, such as medical and student records, and demand special care. Materials that might contain [[personally identifiable information]], such as social security numbers or names, must be handled appropriately, and an archive might provide redacted copies of materials or deny access to materials entirely due to privacy concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taube|first=Daniel O.|last2=Burkhardt|first2=Susan|date=1997|title=Ethical and Legal Risks Associated With Archival Research|url=https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327019eb0701_5|journal=Ethics &amp; Behavior|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=59–67|doi=10.1207/s15327019eb0701_5|issn=1050-8422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://snaproundtable.wordpress.com/2016/02/17/ask-an-archivist-when-to-restrict-personally-identifiable-information-pii/|title=[Ask an Archivist]: When to Restrict Personally Identifiable Information (PII)|date=2016-02-17|work=SNAP Section|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Off-site and electronic materials ====
More and more archival materials are being digitized or are born-digital enabling them to be accessed off-site through the internet or other networked services. Archives that have digital materials accessible to the public may make their holdings discoverable to internet search engines by sharing or exposing their electronic catalogs and/or metadata, using standards like the [[Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting|Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)]]. Some institutions have online portals where users can freely access digital materials that have been made available by the archive such as the [http://archives.nypl.org/ Archives of the New York Public Library] or the [https://siarchives.si.edu/collections Smithsonian Institution Archives]. Governments and their related institutions may use these "electronic", or "virtual", reading rooms to upload documents and materials that have been requested by the public such as through [[FOIA request|FOIA requests]] or in accordance with records disclosure policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/foia/electronic-reading-room|title=NARA Electronic Reading Room/FOIA Library|date=2016-08-31|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.edu/OGC/Records-Reading-Room|title=Records Request Reading Room|website=Smithsonian Institution|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/goga/learn/management/foia-reading.htm|title=FOIA: Reading Room - Golden Gate National Recreation Area (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Atmavritanta'''''{{efn|The original manuscript does not have any title. Its custodian Anandshankar Dhruv wrote the title ''Manilal Nabhubhaino Atmavritanta'' (English: Manilal Nabhubhai's Autobiography) on the opening page of the ledger in which the pages the original manuscript was pasted for preservation. When Dhirubhai Thaker edited and published the first edition, it was published with the title ''Manilal Nabhubhai Dwivedinu Atmavritanta'' (English: Manilal Nabhubhai Dwivedi's Autobiography). It is commonly referred as ''Atmavritanta'' (English: Autobiography, lit. 'Story of Life').}} is an autobiography written by [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] writer [[Manilal Nabhubhai Dwivedi]] (1858&amp;ndash;1898). Its publication was prevented for many years by his family members and friends because it contains explicit details of his extramarital relations and controversial views on morals.&lt;ref name="George1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=K.

==Overview==
[[File:Manilal Dwivedi.jpg|thumb|Manilal Dwivedi|upright=0.9]]
At the age of 28, Dwivedi decided to write his autobiography and to maintain a diary of important events until the end of his life. Explaining this decision, he wrote: "At this time, if not enemies, I had many opponents among those who held different views and they subjected me to countless unfounded criticisms and were spreading misinformation."&lt;ref name="TridipSuhrud"&gt;{{cite book |last=Suhrud|first=Tridip|author-link=Tridip Suhrud|title=Narrations of a Nation: Explorations Through Intellectual Biographies|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/46631|chapter=Love, Desire and Moksha: Manibhai Nabhubhai and the Loss of Svadharma|chapter-url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/46631/8/08_chapter%203.pdf|publisher=School of Social Sciences, [[Gujarat University]]|location=Ahmedabad|type=Ph.D|pages=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the idea of writing an autobiography emerged in his mind from a sense of victimhood and from a desire to give a true picture of his life.&lt;ref name="TridipSuhrud"/&gt;

Dwivedi started writing an account of his life on 9{{nbs}}February 1887 (at [[Mumbai]]), and by 1{{nbs}}May (at [[Nadiad]]) completed the story of his life from birth to that date in 95 pages. Then he maintained a diary in which he noted the important events of his life. Up to 22{{nbs}}August 1895, he wrote 27 such notes (20 in Nadiad, 4 in Mumbai, 1 in [[Vadodara]], 1 in [[Bhavnagar]], and 1 in [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]]). His account of the last three years of his life is not recorded, or, if recorded, cannot be traced.&lt;ref name="Thaker1983"&gt;{{cite book|first=Dhirubhai|last=Thaker|author-link=Dhirubhai Thaker|title=Manilal Dwivedi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3kYHAAACAAJ|series=Makers of Indian Literature|year=1983|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|location=New Delhi|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thaker1999"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Thaker|editor-first=Dhirubhai|title=મણિલાલ નભુભાઈ દ્વિવેદીનું આત્મવૃતાન્ત|trans-title=Autobiography of Manilal Nabhubhai Dwivedi|year=1999|edition=2nd|publisher=Gurjar Grantharatna Karyalay|location=Ahmedabad|pages=10 &amp;ndash; 12|oclc=51822205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publicaton==
Dwivedi handed over the manuscript of his autobiography to his trusted friend [[Anandshankar Dhruv]] (1869–1942) before his death in 1898. Dhruv preserved the manuscript throughout his life. During 1929–1931, some young writers, including [[Ambalal Purani]] and [[Vijayray Vaidya]], raised a public controversy about the need to publish it and pressed Dhruv to release it. Some debates regarding this issue were also published in ''Kaumudi'', a magazine edited by Vaidya.&lt;ref name="Thaker1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thaker2011&gt;{{cite book |last=Thaker |first=Dhirubhai |title=કેટલાક સાહિત્યિક વિવાદો |trans-title=A Few Literary Controversies |year=2011 |publisher=[[Gujarati Vishwakosh|Gujarati Vishwakosh Trust]] |location=Ahmedabad |pages=134-138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the July 1930 issue of ''Kaumudi'', Dhruv published a letter addressed to Vaidya, in which he wrote:&lt;ref name=Thaker2011/&gt;

{{quote|Many people believe that the autobiography of the late Manilal is like [[De Quincy]]'s ''[[Confessions of an English Opium-Eater|Confessions]]'' or like the [[The Story of My Experiments with Truth|autobiography]] of [[Gandhiji]]. But it not like that. It has some writing about living or recently deceased men and women which will be naturally accepted as not suitable for publication, and the publication of the rest is not beneficial to anyone. Even from a literary perspective there is nothing to read there. (except unique style of Late). Apart from me, this writing was read by the late Madhavlal (younger brother of the late Manilal) who clearly said that it is not suitable for publication...|Anandshankar Dhruv, 1930}}&lt;!---Original text: 'આપણા ઘણા ભાઈઓનું માનવું છે કે સ્વ. મણિલાલનું લખેલું આત્મજીવન De Quincy નાં 'Confessions' જેવું, કે ગાંધીજીની આત્મકથા જેવું હશે. એ પ્રકારનું એ બિલકુલ નથી. એમાં હયાત કે થોડા સમય ઉપર ગત થયેલ સ્ત્રી-પુરુષો સંબંધી જે કથન છે એ અત્યારે પ્રસિદ્ધ થાય એ ઈષ્ટ નથી એમ તો સહજ સ્વીકારાશે, અને એ સિવાયનો જે ભાગ છે તે સર્વ પ્રસિદ્ધ કરવાથી કોઈને કશો લાભ થાય એમ નથી બલકે સાહિત્યર્દષ્ટિએ પણ એમાં (સ્વ. ની અનુપમ શૈલી સિવાય) કાંઈ વાંચવા જેવું નથી. આ લેખ મારા ઉપરાંત હજુ સુધી માત્ર સ્વ. માધવલાલે (સ્વ. મણિલાલના નાના ભાઈએ) જ વાંચ્યો છે અને એમણે પણ એ વાંચીને મને સ્પષ્ટ કહેલું કે એ પ્રસિદ્ધ કરવા જેવો નથી...'---&gt;

Dhruv published some edited extracts from the manuscript in his journal ''Vasant'' during 1929 to 1931 in six installments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Purani |first=Ambalal |author-link=Ambalal Purani |title=મણિલાલ નભુભાઈ દ્વિવેદીનું જીવનચરિત્ર |trans-title=Biography of Manilal Nabhubhai Dwivedi |url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.305093/2015.305093.Manilal-Nabhubhai#page/n185/mode/2up |language=gu |year=1951 |publisher=[[Gujarat Vidhya Sabha]] |location=Ahmedabad |pages=184 |oclc=35740385}}&lt;/ref&gt; totaling about 81 pages, but he stopped publishing as soon as the agitation subsided, and then it remained unpublished. Ambalal Purani tried at least fifteen times to obtain a copy of the manuscript from Madhavlal, but was unable to. The manuscript was inherited by Dhruv's son, Dhruvbhai Dhruv after his death. [[Dhirubhai Thaker]], who had written scholarly works on the life and works of Dwivedi, secured the manuscript from Dhruvbhai Dhruv for his thesis. He copied it, prepared a print copy, and published it in 1979 along with the love letters of Diwalibai written to Dwivedi.&lt;ref name="Thaker1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thaker2011/&gt; It was reprinted in 1999.&lt;ref name="Thaker1999"/&gt;

==Physical description of manuscript==

The original manuscript is written on the one side of [[Paper_size#F4|F4]] [[foolscap folio|foolscap]] pages. As  the pages are worn out, they are stick to thick and large ledger size pages of ledger book. Some plain and torn pages are stick in it too. Some pages show [[watermark]] of year 1885. On the opening page of the ledger, a piece of paper from an envelope of [[Banaras Hindu University]] is stick with a title ''Manilal Nabhubhaino Atmavrutant'' in Gujarati written by Anandshankar Dhruv. Behind this first page, a plain paper is stick in two parts. On the second page, Dhruv has written an index mentioning seven sections and its corresponding page numbers. One every page written by Dhruv, there is a short English signature by him.&lt;ref name="Thaker1999" /&gt; The index is as following:&lt;ref name="Thaker1999" /&gt;

Only one manuscript page is stick to each page of the ledge except page numbers 144 and 169 which have two pages of manuscript; 146-147 and 172-173. Manilal had missed number 71 and 131 during marking the page number in manuscript so the manuscript page numbering ends at 198 but it has only 196 pages. Due to sticking two manuscript pages on single ledge page, the page numbering in ledger ends at 194.&lt;ref name="Thaker1999" /&gt;

The work is in two parts; the preamble and the diary. The first gives an account of Dwivedi's life from his birth to his career as a professor, including detailed information on his schooling, on his surroundings and on his companions. The second part is in twenty-seven sections, written on different dates. It contains a day-to-day factual record of events that took place at different places such as Nadiad, Bombay, Baroda, Bhavnagar and Patan.&lt;ref name="Indian Literature 1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Topiwala |first=Chandrakant |author-link=Chandrakant Topiwala |title=Gujarati: The Dominance of Poetry |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23330254 |journal=[[Indian Literature (journal)|Indian Literature]] |volume=23 |issue=6 |year=1980 |pages=13–14}}{{Subscription required |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book contains open confessions and impulsive statements by the author. Dwivedi writes about his achievements very briefly but describes in detail his weaknesses and shortcomings including his numerous moral lapses. As he was sure that the manuscript of his autobiography would not be read by anyone during his lifetime, he accurately described his contradictory life. Sometimes his language became crude and offensive.&lt;ref name=Thaker2011/&gt;

==Reception and criticism==
The book has significant historical value as it reflects the contemporary life of Gujarat, and gives details about the religious, social, economic, ethical and educational life of 19th-century Gujarat. It also gives valuable details about the origin of Dwivedi's few poems.&lt;ref name=Kadiya1980&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kadiya |first=Rasila Chandrakant |title=આત્મકથા: સ્વરૂપ અને વિકાસ |trans-title=Autobiography: Form and Development |url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/191857 |chapter=Chapter 4 |year=1980 |publisher=Department of Gujarati, [[Gujarat Vidyapith]] |location=Ahmedabad |type=Ph.D |page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhirubhai Thaker wrote that the book reminds the reader of the ''[[Confessions (Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and ''My Life'' by [[Havelock Ellis]].&lt;ref name="Thaker1983"/&gt; Anandshankar Dhruv appreciated the autobiography for its unique style of prose writing.&lt;ref name="Thaker1999"/&gt; [[Chandrakant Topiwala]] acclaimed the truthfulness of autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Topiwala|editor-first=Chandrakant|title=ગુજરાતી આત્મકથાલેખન|trans-title=Autobiography Writings in Gujarati|language=gu|year=1998|edition=1st|publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]]|location=New Delhi|page=11|isbn=81-260-0371-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bangjja''' ({{Korean|hangul=방짜|labels=no}}), also called '''yugi''' ({{Korean|hangul=유기|hanja=鍮器|labels=no}}), is a [[Korea]]n type of hand-forged [[bronzeware]]. A complete set of Bangjja includes dishes, bowls, spoons, and chopsticks. The main difference between Korean bronzeware or Bangjja from other bronzeware is the alloy ratio between copper and tin. The Bangjja contains much more tin than other bronzewares (Cu:Sn = 78:22 as volume) while the normal ratio of tin to copper is 1/9. Due to this compositional difference, Bangjja (unlike other kinds of bronzeware) can be sterilized. For this reason, it has historically been used as tableware for the royal families of Korea. Bangjja is used for the traditional presentation of Korean royal court cuisine (surasang). In 1983, the government of South Korea has officially designated Bangjjaa as an [[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea|Important Intangible Cultural Property]].

==History==

Bangjja brassware reflects its deep historical value as well as traditional fashion of Korea. The history of Bangjja originates from the Bronze Age and it was widely used to make a variety of tools and tableware. Ordos region’s bronze culture related to Scythian Bronze Culture was spread and affected several regions including Korean territory. As the Bronze Age culture in Korea was influenced by Ordos region, where bronze culture was originated from the northern part of Siberia, Korean also produced ceremonial products such as ritual tools with bronze.

During the period of the [[Goryeo dynasty]] when they frequently traded with China, royalties and nobles used thin bronze tableware made with Bangjja technique.

In the period of Chosun dynasty, the country greatly supported mining and established many brassware plants in local territories. Although, people in this era generally used porcelains, upper-class people continued using brassware like Goryeo period. As time passed, even in the middle class, people started using brassware increasingly and it formed many markets across the country.

In the end of modern age, most of brassware in all households got ravished by Japan. With the liberation in 1945, brassware became widely used again, but soon after Korean War, when briquettes took place, people preferred stainless bowls to brassware because brassware gets easily discolored by briquettes gas.

In reversal, nowadays, through various chemical experiments, Bangjja brassware is becoming famous and known for its O-157 sterilization function, anti pathogen, and detection of pesticides. Also its heat retention rate turned out to be higher than porcelains and stainless bowls. Bangjja is currently used for making instruments, tableware, and other various goods such as household supplies.

== Characteristics ==
When Bangjja brassware is made, a mass of alloy of copper and tin is heated with fire and gets hammered several times. The proportion of tin in Bangjja brassware is very high compared to general bronze bowls.

First of all, mass of brass nugget is made by alloying copper and tin in ratio of 78:22, which is a golden ratio which permits no error at all. This alloying ratio is not possible in modern metallographic study because in today’s practical products, the proportion of tin must be under 10 percent. Surprisingly, though Bangjja brassware has to be made with the ratio of 78:22. According to modern theology, the existence of Bangjja brassware is unexplainable.

In addition, the robustness of Bangjja brassware is semi-permanent and its placid emotion reflected by its beautiful color is not comparable to any other bowl in the world. It is due to this golden ratio. The brassware cannot endure hammerings without this ratio.

In general, iron becomes more firm when it is quenched after being heated in fire over 1 Celsius nectarine. However, Bangjja brassware becomes softer as it gets heated in fire. This is another mystery of brassware. Several people form a united circle around the mass of annoy and start hammering to make a form of plates. One special thing about the process is that they do not use ready-made mold machine, instead they repeat hammering and heating in fire as they are making the shape of brassware.

== Today's Bangjja ==
Bangjja brassware produced by handed down traditional techniques till today are not bent or easily broken. Furthermore, with more usage, it becomes burnished without any discoloration. Recent reports about various experiments revealed that Bangjja brassware contains a sterilization function and detects pesticides. Bangjja brassware, now called "bowl of mystery" shows its great heat retention, which is far greater than other tableware made with other materials. Since Bangjja is completely free from toxicity, it is also commonly used as a material for percussion instruments like the tam-tam, hobnail, and gong. The sound of the instrument is totally dependant on one hammering of artisans at a time.

Several people form a well organized group to produce Bangjja and it requires complicated and highly skilled techniques to be done, which makes Bangjja more distinctive. Bangjja products are used not only as simple household supplies, but also as work of art, which depicts the traditional custom of Korea. The value of Bangjja brassware is highly respected and it also has a profound mystery, which is unable to be explained by scientific knowledge because Bangjja brassware is the only metal product that is made by a craftsman. A Bangjja artisan Lee Bong-Ju, who was appointed as Important Intangible Cultural Property in 1983 is currently maintaining the root of Bangjja in South Korea. All of his various masterpieces are now exhibited at Dae-Gu Bangjja Brassware Museum.

'''The Bedia Chalice ''' is a piece of the medieval Georgian goldsmithery, a liturgical vessel made of ducat gold and richly decorated. Dated to {{circa|999}}, the chalice was commissioned by King [[Bagrat III of Georgia|Bagrat III]] for the [[Bedia Monastery]] in [[Abkhazia]]. Only the bowl of the vessel is preserved and currently kept at the [[Georgian National Museum]] in [[Tbilisi]].&lt;ref name="MMA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wixom|first1=William D.|editor1-last=Evans|editor1-first=Helen C.|editor2-last=Wixom|editor2-first=William D.|title=The Glory of Byzantium: Art and Culture of the Middle Byzantine Era, A.D. 843–1261|date=1997|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=0870997777|pages=342-344|url=https://books.google.ge/books?id=Caqa12aj55wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Liturgical vessel from Bedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle Ages Embossing Arts: Bedia Chalice|url=http://museum.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=216&amp;info_id=12438|publisher=Georgian National Museum|accessdate=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The chalice was a donation by King Bagrat III and his mother, [[Gurandukht of Abkhazia|Queen Gurandukht]], to the new church at Bedia, which was completed in 999.&lt;ref name="MMA"/&gt; The base of the vessel was subsequently lost and restored in the 16th century at the behest of Germane Chkhetidze, Metropolitan Bishop of Bedia, as mentioned in a Georgian inscription. The item was preserved in the [[sacristy]] of the [[Ilori Church]], when the historian [[Dimitri Bakradze]] visited it in 1865 and reported the danger of its being lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakradze|first1=Dimitri Z.|authorlink1=Dimitri Bakradze|editor1-last=Berge|editor1-first=Adolf|editor1-link=Adolf Berge|script-title=ru:Акты, собранные Кавказской археографической комиссией.

== Description ==
The bowl of the Bedia vessel is 14 cm high and 14 cm in diameter; it weighs 752 g. The piece is made of one sheet of gold, with all figures and details worked in [[repoussé]]. The entire outer surface is framed and divided into 12 segments by a continuous arcade. The figures depicted are the enthroned [[Christ Pantokrator]] and the [[Virgin Hodegetria]] on the opposite side. Between them are standing figures of ten [[apostles]], five on each side, holding [[rotulus|rotuli]] in their hands. Christ is identified by a Greek inscription and all apostles by the Georgian texts; there is no inscription associated with the Virgin. The Georgian-language inscription{{refn|name=a|group=n|The inscription reads in ''asomtavruli'': ႼႫႨႣႠႭ ႶႫႰႧႨႱႫႸႭႡႤႪႭ ႫႤႭႾ ႤႷႠႥ ႼႨႬႠႸႤ ႻႨႱႠ ႸႤႬႨႱႠ ႡႠႢႰႠႲ ႠႴႾႠႦႧႠ ႫႤႴႤႱႠ ႣႠ ႣႤႣႠႱႠ ႫႠႧႱႠ ႢႳႰႠႬႣႳႾႲ ႣႤႣႭႴႠႪႱႠ ႠႫႨႱ ႡႠႰႻႨႫႨႱႠ ႸႤႫႼႨႰႥႤႪႧႠ ႠႫႨႬ; in ''[[mkhedruli]]'' transcription: {{lang-ka|„წმიდაო ღმრთისმშობელო, მეოხ ეყავ წინაშე ძისა შენისა ბაგრატ აფხაზთა მეფესა და დედასა მათსა გურანდუხტ დედოფალსა, ამის ბარძიმისა შემწირველთა, ამის საკურთხევლისა შემამკობელთა და ამის წმიდისა საყდრისა აღმშენებელთა. ამინ“|tr}},&lt;ref name="top"/&gt; translated as: "Holy Mother of God, intercede before your son for Bagrat, king of the Abkhazians, and his mother, the queen Gurandukht, the commissioners of this vessel, the decorators of this altar, and the builders of this holy church. Amen."&lt;ref name="MMA"/&gt;}} just below the rim, in finely carved [[asomtavruli]] script, mentions King Bagrat and Queen Gurandukht.&lt;ref name="MMA"/&gt;

The Bedia chalice is notable for the orderly and rhythmic composition and decorative details which are endogenously Georgian, but exhibit some stylistic affinities with the contemporary [[Byzantine art|Byzantine ivory icons]] and enameled chalices in the [[St Mark's Basilica#The treasury|Treasury of San Marco]], Venice. Yet, robust monumental effect of the artwork of the Bedia chalice is unparalleled.&lt;ref name="MMA"/&gt;

[[File:Heikki Marila 01.JPG|thumb|[[Heikki Marila]], winner of First Prize, 2012]]
The '''Carnegie Art Award''' was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] art award event established in 1998 by Swedish financial group [[Carnegie Investment Bank]] to recognize and promote [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] [[contemporary art|contemporary painting]] and artists. With a total prize sum of SEK 2.1m, the Carnegie Art Award was one of the world’s largest art awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnegieartaward.com/ Carnegie Art Award], Carnegie Investment Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event took place every second year from 2003 to 2014 and consisted of four parts: an exhibition on tour in all Nordic countries, a book and a film presenting the artists and their work, and the awards proper to the three winning artists. Further, one young artist was awarded a [[scholarship]]. 

In order to participate, artists had to be born or live in one of the Nordic countries. They could then be nominated by one of about 30 professionals in the field of contemporary art. A jury then selected the works to be included in the exhibition and the award winners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6204">[[Image:Chinesepaperfoldteal.jpg|thumb|right|Paper folded into the shape of a ''[[sycee]]'', a Chinese gold ingot]]
'''Chinese paper folding''', or '''''zhezhi''''' ({{zh|c=摺紙|p=zhézhǐ}}), is the [[paper art|art]] of paper folding that originated in medieval China.

The work of 20th century Japanese paper artist [[Akira Yoshizawa]] widely popularized the Japanese word "[[origami]]"; however, in China and other Chinese-speaking areas, the art is referred to by the Chinese name, ''zhezhi''. Traditional Chinese paper folding concentrates mainly on objects like boats or hats rather than the animals and flowers of Japanese origami. A recent innovation is from the [[Golden Venture]] migrants where large representational objects are made from [[Modular origami|modular forms]].

==History==
[[Paper]] was first invented by [[Cai Lun]] during the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] era. In the 6th century, [[Buddhist]] monks carried paper to [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Bible"&gt;Nick Robinson, ''The Origami Bible'' (2004), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest document showing paper folding is a picture of a small paper boat in an edition of Tractatus de sphaera mundi from 1490 by Johannes de Sacrobosco. However it is very likely that paper folding originated much earlier than that in China and Japan for ceremonial purposes. In China, traditional funerals include burning folded paper, most often representations of gold nuggets ([[sycee|yuanbao]]). This practice probably started when papers gradually become popular and cheaper in China, and it seems to have become quite common during the Sung Dynasty (905–1125 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laing |first=Ellen Johnston |title= Up In Flames |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8047-3455-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan origami butterflies were used during the celebration of [[Shinto|Shinto weddings]] to represent the bride and groom, so ceremonial paperfolding had probably already become a significant aspect of Japanese ceremony by the [[Heian period]] (794–1185) of Japanese history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A brief history of origami |url=http://www.origami-cdo.it/articoli/storigen.htm |author=Raffaele Leonardi |year=1997 |publisher=Centro Diffusione Origami |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021043007/http://www.origami-cdo.it/articoli/storigen.htm |archivedate=2011-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that paper folding came to Japan from China when paper was introduced but there is no evidence for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Errors and misconceptions about the history of paperfolding |url=http://www.britishorigami.info/academic/lister/errors.php |author=David Lister |publisher=British Origami Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper folding of China has typically been of objects like dishes, hats or boats rather than animals or flowers of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Paper Pandas and Jumping Frogs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wYYeEeYH98cC&amp;pg=PA123#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |first=Florence |last=Temko |isbn=0-8351-1770-7 |year=1986 |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese treasure ship model is probably derived from the Chinese model which uses an unusual fold that may have been inspired by the folded sychee, however in general the models of the two countries are quite different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is the Junk Chinese? |url=http://www.britishorigami.info/academic/lister/junk.php |author=Davis Lister | publisher=British Origami Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significant early publications===
Maying Soong's 1948 book, ''The Art of Chinese Paper Folding'', helped popularise recreational paper folding in the 20th century, and was possibly the first to distinguish the difference between Chinese versus Japanese paper folding – where the Chinese focus primarily on inanimate objects, such as boats or [[pagoda]], the Japanese include representations of living forms, such as the [[Crane (bird)|crane]]. It contains a number of simple traditional designs, some of which are also found in the traditions of other countries. A number of the models are folded from the [[blintz]] base, a form also common in traditional European and Japanese paper folding. The ''Old Scholar's Hat'' is among the old Chinese models found in this book. and the main quote of this book.

==Three dimensional origami==
[[File:Chineseblockunits.png|thumb|How the [[Golden Venture]] modular units are made.]]

In 1993, a group of Chinese [[refugee]]s were detained on the ship ''[[Golden Venture]]'' and held in an American prison, where they began making elaborate models combining traditional Chinese [[modular origami|modular paperfolding]] (utilizing materials such as magazine covers) with a form of [[papier-mâché]] (using [[toilet tissue]]); these models were given to those helping the refugees and sold at charity fundraisers. Media coverage of the refugees helped popularize traditional Chinese modular folding worldwide, which became known as 'Golden Venture folding'.&lt;ref&gt;Origami-rs. "[http://www.origami-resource-center.com/golden-venture-folding.html Origami-rs]." ''Golden Venture Folding.'' Retrieved on 2007-05-24.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This type of modular folding is often done with Chinese [[paper money]]. Triangles are folded from multiple pieces of 1:2 [[aspect ratio]] paper, and connected by inserting a flap of one triangle into a pocket on the next. Popular subjects include pineapples, swans, and ships. This form of [[modular origami]] is commonly referred to as '3D origami'.

'''''The Coronation of the Virgin''''' is a painting by [[Diego Velázquez]] of the [[Coronation of the Virgin|Holy Trinity crowning the Blessed Virgin Mary]], a theme in [[Marian art]]. It is now at the [[Museo del Prado]].

It was probably commissioned for the oratory of the court of [[Elisabeth of France (1602–1644)|Elisabeth of France]], queen consort to [[Philip IV of Spain]], in the [[Real Alcázar of Madrid]]. There it joined others on [[Virgin Mary|Marian]] religious festivities by the [[Naples]] painter [[Andrea Vaccaro]] which had been brought to Madrid by cardinal [[Gaspar de Borja y Velasco]]. The model for Mary in the work may be the same model as the artist used for the ''[[Rokeby Venus]]''.

== Description ==
Velázquez's coronation of the Virgin is exceptional for being a rare religious work by an artist better known for his portraits, and for the air of naturalness and simplicity not found in works by other Baroque religious painters. Its composition is based on an inverted triangle, giving a sense of great equilibrium and harmonious lines and reminiscent (both in its colour and form) of a heart. The main figure is the Virgin Mary, with a modest, reverential, and emotional expression, lowered eyes, a straight nose and curved lips. The sense that the inverted triangle is meant to refer to a heart is reinforced and the viewer's piety invoked by Mary pointing to her own heart.

To the viewer's right is God the Father, represented as a dignified old man, whilst to the left is the long-haired figure of Jesus Christ - together they hold Mary's crown above her head. In the centre the [[Holy Spirit]] is represented in the form of a white dove. The two figures' heads and the dove are all level, on the line of the triangle's base, representing their equality within the [[Holy Trinity]]. Also notable are the [[cherub]]s round the Virgin at the base of the painting - their pictorial quality rivals that of [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]], famous for his cherub-themed works.

The colours Velázquez uses are blues and violets. He also used [[carmine]]s (especially Venetian carmine) instead of traditional reds, following the advice of his tutor Pacheco as written down in his book ''Arte de la Pintura'', despite Velázquez already being an acclaimed artist and well beyond his student years by the time of producing this painting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6091">'''Dancing England''' was a series of showcase traditional dance concerts held at the Derby Assembly Rooms from 1979 to 1987. They were devised and curated by Phil Heaton and John Shaw, members of the Black Cap Sword Dancers, and two very notable characters on the Nottingham and Derby folk and dance scene of the 1970s. Dancing England was set up to showcase the best of traditional dance in the UK, along with unique and/or interesting folk customs to celebrate the UK's wide cultural heritage.

==Dancing England gone by==

In 1979 Phil and John of Black Cap decided to hold a 'Feast' and invite the best dancers from across the UK as their guests, and so the idea of Dancing England was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-nut.net/articles/phil.php] The Nut on the Web. Retrieved on 2016-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was held in the evening and consisted of a series of performances by dance teams across all the styles of UK traditional dance; [[Morris dance|Cotswold Morris]], [[Rapper sword]], [[Long Sword dance|Longsword]], North West, [[Clog dance (British)|step clog dancing]], [[Border Morris|Border]], [[Molly dance|Molly]], and much more. There were also performances by [[Mummers play|mummers]] and [[Pace Egg play|Pace Eggers]], musicians and from some of the more idiosyncratic traditional teams; notably [[Britannia Coco-nut Dancers|The Britannia Coconut Dancers]], [[Abbots Bromley Horn Dance|Abbotts Bromley Horn Dancers]] and the [[Whittlesey#Whittlesea Straw Bear|Whittlesey Straw Bear]]. There were stalls selling music, ephemera and crafts, films, workshops and talks. The event was refreshed with plenty of real ale, and finished with a ceilidh late at night.

==Daughter of Dancing England==

After Dancing England came to an end in 1987, there was a brief reprise in 1993 at the same venue for the Daughter of Dancing England event. This only ran for one year, and both Dancing England and Daughter of same were sadly missed.

==The Dancing England Rapper Tournament (DERT)==

Dancing England featured a rapper sword competition in the afternoon prior to the evening concert, in homage to the Newcastle Tournament of Music and Art which was held in the city from just after the Great War until the 1950s. Following the sad demise of Dancing England in 1987, the competition continued under the name of [[Dancing England Rapper Tournament|DERT]] and now travels around the country being hosted by a different rapper sword team every year.

==The modern Dancing England Series, 2017 onwards==

2019 - Nottingham Playhouse; Saturday 26th January 2019

2017 - Sheffield City Hall; Saturday 18 February 2017.

'''Design and Art Direction''' ('''D&amp;AD''', formerly known as '''British Design &amp; Art Direction''') is a [[United Kingdom|British]] educational [[Charitable organization|charity]] which exists to promote excellence in [[design]] and [[advertising]].

"Widely considered one of the most prestigious and difficult-to-win awards in design and advertising, D&amp;AD celebrates the finest creativity each year across a diverse range of disciplines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/10816786/In-pictures-The-D-and-AD-Awards-2014-celebrating-advertising-and-design.html?frame=2905071|title=In pictures: The D and AD Awards 2014 celebrating advertising and design|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main offices are in [[Spitalfields]] in [[London]].

== History ==

D&amp;AD was founded in 1962 by a group of London-based designers and art directors including [[David Bailey (photographer)|David Bailey]], [[Terence Donovan (photographer)|Terence Donovan]] and [[Alan Fletcher (graphic designer)|Alan Fletcher]] and [[Colin Forbes (graphic designer)|Colin Forbes]] (who designed the original D&amp;AD logo).

A panel of 25 judged the 2500 entries to the first awards in 1963.  They awarded one Black Pencil (to [[Geoffrey Jones Films]]) and 16 Yellow Pencils.  In the early years, winners received an ebony pencil box designed by [[Marcello Minale]], one of the founding partners of Minale Tattersfield, which contained a pencil with silver lettering.  It was a thing of beauty but very delicate, so in 1966 Lou Klein designed the more durable Yellow Pencil.  Its education programmes in their infancy, D&amp;AD launched Graphic Workshops in association with the [[Royal College of Art]] in the mid-60s – they ran until the mid-1970s.

Designer Michael Wolff became D&amp;AD’s first elected president in 1970. Six years later, then-President [[Alan Parker]] gave the first [[D&amp;AD President’s Award]] for outstanding contribution to creativity to Colin Millward of [[Collett Dickenson Pearce]].

Initiated by Sir John Hegarty of [[Bartle Bogle Hegarty]], the Student Awards were launched in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D&amp;AD|title=50 years|date=2012|publisher=Taschen|location=Köln|isbn=9783836539364|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bridging the gap between college and work, the awards present students with real world briefs to tackle.  D&amp;AD’s education programmes continued to grow in 1978 when [[Dave Trott]] set up the D&amp;AD Advertising Workshops.  They aim to inspire and broaden understanding of advertising and help prepare participants for their first jobs. Alex Maranzano, Howard Milton and Brian Webb initiated the first student Design Workshops.

D&amp;AD ushered in the eighties with the first video showreel of moving image work to accompany [[The D&amp;AD Annual]] – it would take until 1987 for the book to be produced in full colour. The Awards had already started to recognise a wider range of categories through the 60s and 70s and Photography, Retail Design (now Environmental Design), Music Videos and Product Design became part of the Awards in the 80s. The Awards also opened up to international entries for the first time in 1988.

Controversy surrounded a decision to hold separate advertising and design awards in 1986 and 1987; the separation, made for practical reasons based on the chosen venue, was seen by members as a split between industries.  The ceremony did come back under one roof, where it has remained.

D&amp;AD moved to Graphite Square, in Vauxhall in the 1990s.  These were busy times for education; the first Student Expo (now New Blood) and the University Network – D&amp;AD's membership programme for university and college courses – launched in 1993. The first session of Xchange took place in 1996 – described as a ‘summer school’ for college lecturers; creative practitioners update participants on the latest industry trends.

D&amp;AD entered the digital age with the launch of www.dandad.org in 1996 and introduced its first digital categories to the Awards in 1997.  Not only was the media landscape changing, by the end of the decade, 50% of entries to the Awards came from outside the UK.

D&amp;AD celebrated its 40th birthday in 2002 with ''Rewind'', a retrospective exhibition and book of some of the most iconic work since the 1960s at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]].

A new benchmark was set at the turn of the century when a double Black Pencil was awarded to [[AMV.BBDO]]’s ‘Surfer’ for [[Guinness]] for its visuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/4491388/Copy-makes-headlines.html|title=Copy makes headlines|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was matched 5 years later by ‘Grrr’, [[Wieden + Kennedy]] London's work for [[Honda]] UK.  In 2006 another milestone was set as [[Leo Burnett Worldwide|leoburnett.com]] won the first digital Black Pencil.  Developments in the industry meant that two new categories were added in 2008 – Broadcast Innovations and Mobile Marketing, that year [[Apple Inc.]] won a [[Black Pencil]] for the [[iMac]] and the first-generation [[IPhone (1st generation)|iPhone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/02/business/media/02adnewsletter3.html|title=People and Accounts of Note|last=The New York Times|date=2008-06-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design Workshops were relaunched in 2006 and [[D&amp;AD North]], its first regional network, in Manchester the same year.  The Student Awards have become an increasingly international event – entries in 2007 came from colleges in over 40 countries.  Italian design group [[Fabrica]] designed The Annual outside the UK for the first time in 2007 and the showreel moved online that same year.

In 2012 D&amp;AD moved to its current location on [[Hanbury Street]], celebrated its 50th anniversary by honouring the most successful award-winners in its history, and launched the D&amp;AD Foundation to nurture creative talent.  Design book publisher [[Taschen]] released a limited-run book featuring 50 years of D&amp;AD annual covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/9706753/DandAD-50th-Annual-original-cover-artwork-by-50-design-legends-up-for-sale.html|title=D&amp;AD 50th Annual: original cover artwork by 50 design legends up for sale|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Directions in Design and Craft
Introduction
Design began as a craft, with a central focus on creating beautiful objects to powerfully impacting the industry. Today, both design and craft have developed beyond their simple origin to the development of powerful channels through which interaction of people can occur, experiences can be emphasized, and not technology itself (Johnny, 2011). Its evolution has also made it a channel for new ways of thinking, discovering problems, and enabling the enhancement of lives of the individuals (Gero, 1996). What are the new directions for design aside from the old craft traditions?
Design as an evidence-based discipline
As a skilled process, designing is involved in the creation of useful and beautiful items. In various educational facilities across the world, a wide range of time has been used to master any skill in crafts involved in making drawings, constructions of materials, manufacture, and finishings. Moreover, in these educational facilities, very little time is spent outside these crafts and in subjects including any social, major world event or overall literature. A very small effort is spent on core STEM aspects of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. This is strange as designs act as the connection between technology and individuals yet very little research or study of either exists (Cross, 1999). Individuals no longer display an essential understanding of the backbones of technology. With the 21st century's enhancements in how sophisticated technology used for businesses, home, and educational purposes are, designers who insist on remaining craftspeople will only have the ability to add an amount of value, but won't be able to take the lead. Design as a craft is an essential profession but contains limitations in capabilities that artists can possess. The world of technology has undergone fast-paced change supported by advancements in science and technology along with the increasing comprehension of the ways in which modern technology socially and environmentally impacts individuals. There has been a depletion in natural resources, and the environment suffers pollutions, and social unrest affects populations in every country. Educational activities involved in craft are not enough to tackle any of these challenges. 
Tradition designs and crafts did not need formal designs, as the viewable outcomes acted to prove the efforts of the artist. The intuitions of the designer act as guidance for the designer and appreciations can be made through the discernment of the viewer. This is an approach that was effective concerning simple objects such as watches and furniture. However, enhancements in technology made even the simples objects more complicated. This was followed by confusion and frustration which demanded new forms of designs to deal with an increase in complexity. Hence, the design had to be based on the technical knowledge of technology while also appreciating how limited ordinary individuals were and their capability to master the devices. As individuals cannot observe the underlying operations, designers to increase the level to which a design can be understood or used.
Hence design was further developed through outer-designs which included outcomes such as ‘interaction designs,' ‘experience-based designs,' or ‘human-computer interactions.’ All of this development underwent incorporation into current design processes. As shifts in design occurred, there were also changes in its fundamental aspects. The outcome was the structuring on new types of design, with some originating from entities that were external to the design communities. Human-centered design acts as one of the most essential types of enhanced designs. It is a practice which needs an increased comprehension of people and starts with observations and a well-defined procedure to find out the genuine underlying issues and needs. These issues can then be evaluated through an evidence-based process of ideation, prototypes, and carrying out tests and till a solution is found (Yap et al., 2014). The result is increasing innovation with optimal solutions in an increasingly complex environment. 
The human-centered design has some primary principles. One of these principles is that result is structured for increase the level of efficiency within the lives of the individuals that will utilize the design. Human-centered design also never rushes to solutions and is evidence-based. Lastly, human-centered design is action-oriented as learning is enabled by going through continual processes of creations, tests, and observations. It moves people away from the designer as the only expert and into an essential professional field where systems and methods exist for the discovery of the true needs of individuals in society. Designs used to be entirely based on opinion but are now fully based on evidence. The design society is human-centered. 
Design-Thinking for added value
Designers have been talking about design-thinking, and the concept was revived as a part of the marketing slogan by the company IDEO. It is involved in the designation of the utilization of human-centered principles in the application of design to an entirely undiscovered domain. An essential contribution of the concept of design thinking to individuals who are not considered as designers is the capability to take a step back and carry out a reconceptualization of issues for the formation of new perspectives on existing issues. Designers who can be referred to as design-thinkers place their focus not on developing pretty things but on increasing the value of activities and creating effective frameworks through which major issues can be viewed (Carroll, 2015). In business, this means the replacement of the time-honored focus on issues such as profitability for the maximization of experience the individuals involved. In healthcare, the perspective has had a revolutionary effect. As the application of design thinking is on a varied range of activities starting with city structures to designing healthcare and transport systems, the contribution of traditional craft training is minimal. 
Design education
The existing procedures within education are no longer profitable for future design outcomes. Making a consideration of the complicated issues of healthcare while engaging in optimization of the experiences of all the individuals that plays a part in it, the traditional design courses no longer help. The courses that would be expected to help are those in service design, but traditional service design addresses issues that are simple and not complicated system like healthcare. Around the world, crises in systems such as transportation and education are being addressed. The environment is also an essential aspect, through design for an impact of global change despite the resistance of relevant authorities and entities to make an acknowledgment of how big the issue is. Designs educators can continue with their conformance to traditionally-inclined capabilities and display pride in the results they provide as well as the fine crafts-people they have released into the world. There will always be a need for this skill set in the world, but it will act as a representation of the past.  
For the transformation of education as a leader for future designers, educators must invest themselves in encouraging students to go on with the exploration and learning more of technology, social sciences, political and environmental issues. For the next couple of years, there will be transformations in design to a field that aims to promote new modes of thinking, human-centered approaches to the solutions of complicated challenges, and approaches to shift from the tyranny of technology to empower individuals (Weimer, 1993). Human-centered design is based off the needs of individuals first when addressing main issues in the society. Modern design is different from a large number of discipline lines in academia by being a field of creators instead of analysts. Each designer is a practitioner. This makes design special within educational facilities, as it constructs upon the data of all the specialization units in the university to result in constructing, developing, building and shaping the world. It enables the combination of technology with human activities. It is the way in which knowledge can be practically applied. 
Conclusion
In the current period, design can be presented as more than a craft with individuals who have technical training investing themselves in the production of aesthetic items. This type of design has an important role in people's lives, through the production of wonderful items that provide emotional satisfaction in the everyday activities of individuals. However, a design is much more than constructing pleasurable items, it is the base for entire educational facilities, teaching systems thinking, bridging across specialization systems, technology, and people. The future of the craft still has a large number of areas for exploration and development. All manners of increased developments will occur, some types of interactions, some completely new dimensions of experiences, and rethinking existent activities and services.

The '''''Donne Triptych''''' (or '''''Donne Altarpiece''''') is a hinged-[[triptych]] altarpiece by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Hans Memling]]. It consists of five individual panel paintings: a central inner panel, and two double-sided wings. It was painted for [[Sir John Donne]], probably sometime between the late 1470s or early 1480s, and is in the permanent collection of the [[National Gallery]], London, with the panels still in their original frames.

When Donne commissioned the work is unknown. Art historians have debated whether it was painted in the early 1480s, around the same time Memling painted ''[[Mystic Marriage of St. Catherine (Memling)|Virgin and Child with Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara]]'', in New York at the [[Metropolitan Art Museum]]. An earlier date of sometime in the late 1470s is possible, at the time he completed the similar ''[[St John Altarpiece (Memling)|St John Altarpiece]]'', or it may have been painted as a precursor to that altarpiece.&lt;ref name = "Met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/437054 "Virgin and Child with Saints"].

The donor, Sir John Donne, was a Welsh-born diplomat for the [[House of York]] who visited Bruges at least once, in 1468 to attend [[Charles the Bold]] and [[Margaret of York]]'s wedding; how he became acquainted with Memling is as uncertain as when he commissioned the triptych.&lt;ref name ="Bruce79"&gt;Bruce, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Elegy for Iris''''' is a 1999 memoir by [[John Bayley (writer)|John Bayley]], about his marriage to fellow author [[Iris Murdoch]], who suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]] in her last years. Bayley also wrote two more books about his life with Murdoch, ''Iris and Her Friends'' and ''[[Widower's House]]''.

In 2001, the film ''[[Iris (2001 film)|Iris]]'' was based on Bayley's book. Part of the movie and the book on the life of Iris Murdoch both dealt with her view of marriage, in which she felt it was acceptable for her to engage in adultery. Her husband, John Bayley, knew about her acts of infidelity, especially with one lover in particular. He tolerated it throughout their marriage.

The '''feminist art movement in the United States''' began in the early 1970s and sought to promote the study, creation, understanding and promotion of women's art. 
First-generation feminist artists include [[Judy Chicago]], [[Miriam Schapiro]], [[Suzanne Lacy]], [[Judith Bernstein]], [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville|Sheila de Bretteville]], [[Mary Beth Edelson]], [[Carolee Schneeman]], [[Rachel Rosenthal]], and many other women. They were part of the [[Feminist art movement]] in the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Thomas Patin  |author2=Jennifer McLerran  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Artwords: A Glossary of Contemporary Art Theory |location=Westport, CT | publisher=Greenwood | year=1997 |page=55 | url=https://www.questia.com/read/27960870 |accessdate=8 January 2014 }} via [[Questia]] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement spread quickly through museum protests in both New York (May 1970) and Los Angeles (June 1971), via an early network called W.E.B. ([[West-East Bag]]) that disseminated news of feminist art activities from 1971 to 1973 in a nationally circulated newsletter, and at conferences such as the West Coast Women's Artists Conference held at [[California Institute of the Arts]] (January 21–23, 1972) and the [[Conference on Women in the Visual Arts]], at the [[Corcoran School of Art]] in Washington, D.C.

===Key activities===

====''Maintenance Art—Proposal for an Exhibition''====
In 1969 [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]] wrote a manifesto entitled ''Maintenance Art—Proposal for an Exhibition'', challenging the domestic role of women and proclaiming herself a "maintenance artist". Maintenance, for Ukeles, is the realm of human activities that keep things going, such as cooking, cleaning and child-rearing and her performances in the 1970s included the cleaning of art galleries.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bird, Michael Newman, ''Rewriting Conceptual Art'', Reaktion Books, 1999, p114-5. {{ISBN|1-86189-052-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her first performance called ''Touch Sanitation'' was from 1979-80.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moussemagazine.it/mierle-laderman-ukeles-maintenance-art-queens-museum-new-york/|title=Mierle Laderman Ukeles "Maintenance Art" at Queens Museum, New York •Mousse Magazine|website=moussemagazine.it|language=it-IT|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Art Workers' Coalition demands equal representation for women====
A demand for equality in representation for female artists was codified in the [[Art Workers' Coalition]]'s (AWC) Statement of Demands, which was developed in 1969 and published in definitive form in March 1970. The AWC was set up to defend the rights of artists and force museums and galleries to reform their practices. While the coalition sprung up as a protest movement following Greek kinetic sculptor [[Takis|Panagiotis "Takis" Vassilakis]]'s physical removal of his work Tele-Sculpture(1960) from a 1969 exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, it quickly issued a broad list of demands to 'art museums in general'.

Alongside calls for free admission, better representation of ethnic minorities, late openings and an agreement that galleries would not exhibit an artwork without the artist's consent, the AWC demanded that museums 'encourage female artists to overcome centuries of damage done to the image of the female as an artist by establishing equal representation of the sexes in exhibitions, museum purchases and on selection committees'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Charles|title=Art in theory|date=2000|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=0-631-16575-4|pages=901–2|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Initial feminist art classes====
The first women's art class was taught in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College, now [[California State University, Fresno]], by artist [[Judy Chicago]]. It became the [[Feminist Art Program]], a full 15-unit program, in the Spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, [[Vanalyne Green]], [[Suzanne Lacy]], Cay Lang, [[Karen LeCocq]], Jan Lester, [[Chris Rush]], Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, [[Faith Wilding]], Shawnee Wollenman, [[Nancy Youdelman]], and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. 
Later, Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro reestablished the [[Feminist Art Program]] (FAP) at [[California Institute of the Arts]]. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by [[Joyce Aiken]] in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.{{refn|Aiken opened the all-women's [[co-op]] [[Gallery 25]] with her students, developed the Fresno Art Museum's Council of 100 and the Distinguished Women Artist Series, which helped develop programming and exhibitions about women at the museum.&lt;ref name="Fresno1"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dr. Laura Meyer |author2=Nancy Youdelman | year= | title=A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist Art Experiment | work=A Studio of their Own | publisher= | url=http://www.astudiooftheirown.org/legacy.html | accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

The Fresno Feminist Art Program served as a model for other feminist art efforts, such as [[Womanhouse]], a collaborative feminist art exhibition and the first project produced after the Feminist Art Program moved to the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in the fall of 1971. Womanhouse, like the Fresno project, also developed into a feminist studio space and promoted the concept of collaborative women's art.&lt;ref name="Fresno1"/&gt;

The Feminist Studio Workshop was founded in Los Angeles in 1973 by [[Judy Chicago]], [[Arlene Raven]], and [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]] as a two-year feminist art program. Women from the program were instrumental in finding and creating the [[Woman's Building]], the first independent center to showcase women's art and culture. Galleries existed there for the entire history of the organization and that was a major venue for exhibiting feminist art.

Art historian [[Arlene Raven]] established the Feminist Art Program in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Arlene Raven | editor=Arlene Raven |editor2=Cassandra L.

====''Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?''====

In 1971, the art historian [[Linda Nochlin]] published the article "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]" in ''Woman in Sexist Society,'' which was later reprinted in ''ArtNews,'' where she claimed that there were no "great" women artists at that time, nor in history. By omission, this inferred that artists like [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] and [[Mary Cassatt]] were not considered great. She stated why she felt that there were no great women artists and what organizational and institutional changes needed to take place to create better opportunities for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Arlene Raven | editor=Arlene Raven |editor2=Cassandra L. Langer |editor3=Joanna Frueh  |chapter=The Last Essay on Feminist Criticism |title=Feminist Art Criticism: An Anthology|location=New York | publisher=Icon Editions | year=1991 |pages=41–42 | url=https://www.questia.com/read/99908276 |accessdate=8 January 2014 }} via [[Questia]] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

The author [[Lucy Lippard]] and others identified three tasks to further the understanding and promotion of works by women:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Arlene Raven | editor=Arlene Raven |editor2=Cassandra L.

* Find and present current and historic art works by women
* Develop a more informal language for writing about art by women
* Create theories about the meanings behind women's art and create a history of their works.

====Approaches====
In California, the approach to improve the opportunities for women artists focused on creating venues, such as the [[Woman's Building]] and the Feminist Studio Workshop (FSW), located with the Woman's Building.  Gallery spaces, feminist magazine offices, a bookstore, and a cafe were some of the key uses of the Feminist Studio Workshop.&lt;ref name="Art Story" /&gt;

Organizations like [[A.I.R. Gallery]] and [[Women Artists in Revolution|Women Artists in Revolution (WAR)]] were formed in New York to provide greater opportunity for female artists and protest for to include works of women artist in art venues that had very few women represented, like [[Whitney Museum]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. In 1970 there was a 23% increase in the number of women artists, and the previous year there was a 10% increase, due to [[Whitney Biennial|Whitney Annual]] (later Whitney Biennial) protests.&lt;ref name="Art Story"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-feminist-art.htm# | title=Feminist art movement | publisher=The Art Story Foundation | accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York Feminist Art Institute]] opened in June 1979 at 325 Spring Street in the Port Authority Building. The founding members and the initial board of directors were [[Nancy Azara]], [[Miriam Schapiro]], Selena Whitefeather, Lucille Lessane, [[Irene Peslikis]] and Carol Stronghilos.&lt;ref name=Rutgers&gt;Fernanda Perrone, Amy Dawson, and Caroline T.

====''Three Weeks in May''====
In 1977, [[Suzanne Lacy]] and collaborator Leslie Labowitz, combined performance art with activism in ''[[Three Weeks in May]]'' on the steps of [[Los Angeles City Hall]]. The performance, which included a map of rapes in the city, and [[self-defense]] classes highlighted [[sexual violence]] against women.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Turning Stereotypes Into Artistic Strengths  |author=Karen Rosenberg |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 28, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/arts/design/28toge.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
''[[The Feminist Art Journal]]'' was a feminist art publication that was produced from 1972 to 1977, and was the first stable, widely read journal of its kind. Beginning in 1975 there were scholarly publications about feminism, feminist art and historic women's art, most notably ''Through the Flower: My Struggle as a Woman Artist'' by [[Judy Chicago]]; and ''Against Our Will: Men, Women and Rape'' (1975) by [[Susan Brownmiller]]; ''Woman Artists: 1550-1950'' (1976) about [[Linda Nochlin]] and Ann Sutherland Harris's exhibition; ''From the Center: Feminist Essays in Women's Art'' (1976) by [[Lucy Lippard]]; ''Of Woman Born,'' by [[Adrienne Rich]], ''When God Was a Woman'' (1976) by [[Merlin Stone]]; ''By Our Own Hands'' (1978) by [[Faith Wilding]]; ''Gyn/Ecology'' (1978) by [[Mary Daly]]; and ''Woman and Nature'' by [[Susan Griffin]].&lt;ref name="Visions and Re-visions"&gt;{{cite book | author=Moira Roth | chapter=Visions and Re-Visions: Rosa Luxemburg and the Artist's Mother |title=Feminist Art Criticism: An Anthology |editor=Arlene Raven |editor2=Cassandra L.

In 1977, both ''[[Chrysalis (magazine)|Chrysalis]]'' and ''[[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics]]'' began publication.&lt;ref name="Visions and Re-visions" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://helios.hampshire.edu/nomorenicegirls/heretics/#index ''Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics''](1977–92), now the subject of a documentary film, [http://helios.hampshire.edu/nomorenicegirls/heretics/#overview The Heretics].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|''Chrysalis Magazine'' (1977–80), was organized out of the Los Angeles [[Woman's Building]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}|group=nb}}

==1980s==
Feminist art evolved during the 1980s, with a trend away from experiential works and social causes. Instead, there was a trend toward works based upon [[Postmodern theory]] and influenced by [[psychoanalysis]]. Inequal representation in the artworld was a continuing issue.&lt;ref name="Art Story" /&gt;

===Key activities===

====Guerrilla Girls====
[[Guerrilla Girls]] was formed by 7 women artists in the spring of 1985 in response to the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s exhibition "An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture", which opened in 1984. The exhibition was the inaugural show in the MoMA's newly renovated and expanded building, and was planned to be a survey of the most important contemporary artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brenson|first=Michael|title=A Living Artists Show at the Modern Museum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/21/arts/a-living-artists-show-at-the-modern-museum.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=27 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 21, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guerrilla Girls have researched sexism and created artworks at the request of various people and institutions, among others, the [[Istanbul Modern]], Istanbul, Witte de With Center for Contemporary Arts, Rotterdam and Fundación Bilbao Arte Fundazioa, Bilbao. They have also partnered with [[Amnesty International]], contributing pieces to a show under the organization's "Protect the Human" initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=16632 |title=Press Releases &amp;#124; Amnesty International UK |publisher=Amnesty.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mass communication====
[[Mass communication]] is "the process by which a person, group of people, or large organization creates a message and transmits it through some type of medium to a large, anonymous, heterogeneous audience." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Media and Mass Communication Theories|date=2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|pages=624–628|last1=Pearce|first1=K.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women such as [[Barbara Kruger]] and [[Jenny Holzer]] used forms of graphic mass communication such as refined slogans and graphics to increase awareness of the inequity faced by women artists.&lt;ref name="Art Story" /&gt;

'''Kiki Smith'''

During the 1970s [[Kiki Smith]] was one of the many artists involved in the collaborative projects. As the art scene became more politicized in the 1980s, Kiki Smith's art work also became more political as well. Her work started "involving issues like abortion, race and AIDS." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/16/arts/art-view-kiki-smith-the-body-as-political-battleground.html&lt;/ref&gt; When asked if she considered herself a feminist artist, Smith responded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, I would say that generationally I am, and I would say that without the feminist movement I wouldn't exist; and an enormous amount of the artwork that we take for granted wouldn't exist; and a lot of the subject matter that we assume can be encompassed by art wouldn't exist.  The feminist movement exponentially expanded what art is, and how we look at art, and who is considered to be included in the discourse of art-making. I think that it caused a tremendous, radical change. You don't want to have a cultural notion that one specific gender embodies creativity. All humanity – and all aspects of gender and sexuality and how people define themselves – are inherently creative. It's against the interests of the culture at large not to embrace feminism as a model, just like many other models of liberation, because they don't only liberate women, they liberate everybody.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.askyfilledwithshootingstars.com/wordpress/?p=1128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Feminist art curatorial practices===

====History====

Feminist art curating practices are within a museumism genre, which is a deconstructing of the museum space by curator/artist where the museum looks at itself or the artist/curator looks at the museum.

"If artists as curators of their own exhibition is no longer uncommon, neither is the artist-created museum or collection ... These artists use museological practices to confront the ways in which museums rewrite history through the politics of collecting and presentation ... However, their work often inadvertently reasserts the validity of the museum" (Corrin, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;5).&lt;ref&gt;CORRIN, L. G. (1993). Mining the museum: An installation confronting history. [[Curator: The Museum Journal]], 36(4), 302-313. doi:10.1111/j.2151-6952.1993.tb00804.x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klebesadel, Helen (2005). Reframing studio art production and critique. In Janet Marstine (Ed.), New museum theory and practice an introduction (pp. 247-265). Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Katy Deepwell]] documents feminist curating practice and feminist art history with a theoretical foundation that feminist curating is not biologically determinate.&lt;ref&gt;Deepwell, Katy (2005). Feminist curatorial strategies and practices since the 1970s. In Janet Marstine (Ed.), New museum theory and practice an introduction (pp. 64-84). Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Characteristics====

Feminist art curatorial practices are collaborative and reject the notion of an artist as an individual creative genius.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, R., &amp; Pollock, G. (1981). Old mistresses: Women, art and ideology. New York: Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curatorial Collectives and Feminist Politics in 21st Century Europe: An Interview with Kuratorisk Aktion&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hedlin Hayden, Malin &amp; Sjoholm Skrubbe, Jessica (Eds.).

== Feminist Art Movement in 2018 ==

=== #metoo movement represented in Feminist Art Movement ===
Carnegie Mellon art galleries director Elizabeth Chodos and assistant director Margaret Cox put up a gallery for Faith Wilding's artwork, who was a prominent artist who studied art in the 70's when issues like rape and sexual abuse were too taboo to discuss. She learned to be open with her artwork focusing on female bodies working alongside other female art students. She did however, criticize the fact that most art teachers were male.  The ideas explored in her work offered influence for key elements of the #metoo movement but also recognizes that we still have a long way to go in terms of equality and respect. Wilding's artwork addressed social issues relating to sexual assault that are just now beginning to emerge culturally through #metoo.

The '''Sir George-Étienne Cartier Monument'''  is a monument in [[Mount Royal#Mount Royal Park|Mount Royal Park]] to [[George-Étienne Cartier]] by sculptor [[George William Hill (sculptor)|George William Hill]] (1862–1934).
[[File:Monument G E Cartier Est.JPG|thumb|left|The ''George-Étienne Cartier'' statue on the monument]]
The monument, which is topped by a winged [[Liberty (goddess)|Goddess of Liberty]], was inaugurated on September 6, 1919 in the heart of Fletcher's Field west side. In temperate months it is the site of free weekly drum circle festivals informally called [[Tam-Tams]].&lt;ref name="cartier"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=9d571f9c-ad2e-44f0-b106-138ef2ea32a3|title=Cartier returns|date=May 23, 2008|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the front, or East side of the monument, George-Étienne Cartier is portrayed standing above four other figures, each one representing a Province that signed the [[Canadian Confederation|Canadian Confederation of 1867]]. 

On the North side of the monument, a woman with a young girl to her right and a young boy to her left is shown holding a sword in her left hand. The boy holds out his bonded wrists in a begging manner as the girl reads a book. This scene represents [[Canadian legislation|Legislation]].

On the South side, in a similar scene to the North side, a woman sits in the middle of a young boy who is holding a ball and a young girl who is reading a book. This represents Cartier's important contributions in education.

A '''goldsmith''' is a [[Metalworking|metalworker]] who specializes in working with [[gold]] and other [[precious metal]]s. Historically, goldsmiths also have made [[cutlery|silverware]], [[platter (dishware)|platter]]s, [[goblet]]s, decorative and serviceable utensils, [[ceremonial]] or [[religious]] items, and rarely using [[Kintsugi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/02/AR2009030202723.html|title=Kintsugi|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the rising prices of precious metals have curtailed the making of such items to a large degree.

Goldsmiths must be skilled in forming metal through [[file (tool)|filing]], [[brazing|soldering]], [[saw]]ing, [[forging]], [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]], and [[polishing]] metal. The trade has very often included [[jewellery]]-making skills, as well as the very similar skills of the [[silversmith]]. Traditionally, these skills had been passed along through [[apprenticeship]]s, however, more recently jewellery arts schools specializing solely in teaching goldsmithing and a multitude of skills falling under the jewellery arts umbrella are available. Many universities and junior colleges also offer goldsmithing, silversmithing, and metal arts fabrication as a part of their fine arts curriculum.

At least in Europe, goldsmiths increasingly performed many of the functions we now regard as part of [[banking]], especially providing custody of valuable items and currency exchange, though they were usually restrained from lending at interest, which was regarded as [[usury]].

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Goudsmid Pa Soerau naast zijn gereedschap Karolanden TMnr 10014305.jpg|thumb|Karo goldsmith and his tools]]
Compared to other metals, gold is [[malleable]], [[ductile]], rare, and it is the only solid metallic [[Chemical element|element]] with a [[yellow]] [[color]]. It may easily be melted, fused, and cast without the problems of oxides and gas that are problematic with other metals such as [[bronze]]s, for example. It is fairly easy to "pressure weld", wherein similarly to clay two small pieces may be pounded together to make one larger piece. Gold is classified as a [[noble metal]]&amp;mdash;because it does not react with most elements. It usually is found in its [[native metal|native]] form, lasting indefinitely without oxidization and tarnishing.

==History==
[[File:Fotothek df tg 0007208 Ständebuch ^ Beruf ^ Handwerk ^ Goldschmied.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A goldsmith workshop during the mid-seventeenth century]]

Gold has been worked by humans in all [[cultures]] where the metal is available, either indigenously or imported, and the history of these activities is extensive. Superbly made objects from the ancient cultures of [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], [[India]], [[North America]], Mesoamerica, and South America grace museums and collections throughout the world. Some pieces date back thousands of years and were made using many techniques that still are used by modern goldsmiths. Techniques developed by some of those goldsmiths achieved a skill level that was lost and remained beyond the skills of those who followed, even to modern times.&lt;ref&gt;American Chemical Society, [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130724124919.htm ''Ancient technology for metal coatings 2,000 years ago can't be matched even today''], ScienceDaily, ScienceDaily, July 24, 2013,&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers attempting to uncover the chemical techniques used by ancient artisans have remarked that their findings confirm that "the high level of competence reached by the artists and craftsmen of these ancient periods who produced objects of an artistic quality that could not be bettered in ancient times and has not yet been reached in modern ones."&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Maria Ingo, Giuseppe Guida, Emma Angelini, Gabriella Di Carlo, Alessio Mezzi, Giuseppina Padeletti, ''Ancient Mercury-Based Plating Methods: Combined Use of Surface Analytical Techniques for the Study of Manufacturing Process and Degradation Phenomena'', Accounts of Chemical Research, 2013; 130705111206005 DOI: 10.1021/ar300232e&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=August 2018}}

In [[medieval]] Europe goldsmiths were organized into [[guild]]s and usually were one of the most important and wealthiest of the guilds in a city. The guild kept records of members and the marks they used on their products. These records, when they survive, are very useful to historians.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Goldsmiths often acted as [[banker]]s, since they dealt in gold and had sufficient security for the safe storage of valuable items. In the [[Middle Ages]], goldsmithing normally included silversmithing as well, but the brass workers and workers in other [[base metal]]s normally were members of a separate guild, since the trades were not allowed to overlap. Many [[jeweler]]s also were goldsmiths.

[[File:Gold and Silver Smith Lucknow India 1890.jpg|thumb|Gold and silver smith in Lucknow, India 1890]]
The [[Sunar]] caste is one of the oldest communities in goldsmithing in India, whose superb gold artworks were displayed at [[The Great Exhibition of 1851]] in London. In India, '[[Vishwakarma (caste)|Vishwakarma]]' are the goldsmith caste.

The [[printmaking]] technique of [[engraving]] developed among goldsmiths in Germany around 1430, who had long used the technique on their metal pieces. The notable [[engraver]]s of the fifteenth century were either goldsmiths, such as [[Master E. S.]], or the sons of goldsmiths, such as [[Martin Schongauer]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]].

==Contemporary goldsmithing==
[[File:Christus saint eloi orfèvre.jpg|thumb|Medieval goldsmith shop.]]
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Goudsmeden aan het werk in goudsmidwinkel Atjeh TMnr 10014478.jpg|thumb|Goldsmith shop in [[Aceh]], [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]] during the early-20th century. The man in the middle may be a "Klingalees" (orang Keling), someone from South India]]
A goldsmith might have a wide array of skills and knowledge at their disposal. [[Gold]], being the most [[malleable]] metal of all, offers unique opportunities for the worker. In today's world a wide variety of other metals, especially [[platinum]] alloys, also may be used frequently. 24 [[karat (purity)|karat]] is pure gold and historically, was known as [[fine gold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McQuhae | first = William | title = McQuhae's Practical Technical Instructor | page = 91 | publisher =  | year =  | edition = 3rd | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_c5sEPzM4GQC&amp;pg=PA91 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it is so soft, however, 24 karat gold is rarely used. It usually is [[alloy]]ed to make it stronger and to create different colors; goldsmiths may have some skill in that process. The gold may be [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] into some item then, usually with the [[lost wax casting]] process, or it may be used to fabricate the work directly in metal.

In the latter case, the goldsmith will use a variety of tools and machinery, including the [[rolling mill]], the [[drawplate]], and perhaps, [[swage block]]s and other forming tools to make the metal into shapes needed to build the intended piece. Then parts are fabricated through a wide variety of processes and assembled by [[brazing|soldering]]. It is a testament to the history and evolution of the trade that those skills have reached an extremely high level of attainment and skill over time. A fine goldsmith can and will work to a tolerance approaching that of precision machinery, but largely using only his eyes and hand tools. Quite often the goldsmith's job involves the making of mountings for [[gemstone]]s, in which case they often are referred to as ''jewelers''.

'Jeweller', however, is a term mostly reserved for a person who deals in jewellery (buys and sells) and not to be confused with a goldsmith, silversmith, gemologist, diamond cutter, and diamond setters. A 'jobbing jeweller' is the term for a jeweller who undertakes a small basic amount of jewellery repair and alteration.

'''Guildford School of Acting (GSA)''' is a drama school in [[Guildford]], Surrey, England.  It is an academic school in the [[University of Surrey]] with accreditation from Drama UK for its professional training degrees. As of 2014, it is the top scoring Drama UK accredited school for student satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gsauk.org/gsa-achieves-success-national-student-survey-2014/ |title=GSA achieves success in the National Student Survey 2014 |accessdate=19 August 2014 |date=August 2014 |publisher=Guildford School of Acting |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820084216/http://gsauk.org/gsa-achieves-success-national-student-survey-2014/ |archivedate=20 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Guildford School of Acting (GSA), originally known as the '''Grant-Bellairs School of Dance and Drama''', was founded in London in 1935 by Pauline Grant and Bice Bellairs.  The school moved to Guildford in 1945 as a result of [[World War II]].  In 1964, the school became a charitable organisation and was renamed Guildford School of Acting &amp; Dance.  In the early 1990s the '&amp; Dance' was dropped. Today the school is part of the University of Surrey's Stag Hill Campus, Guildford, Surrey.

The school offers professional training and academic degrees in theatre and performance, dance, acting, musical theatre and [[Stagecraft|production skills]] such as [[stage management]], [[Lighting designer|lighting]] and [[sound design]]. Surrey has a long association with dance having been the first university in the UK to validate a single honours dance degree. The university also hosts the National Resource Centre for Dance established in 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surrey.ac.uk/nrcd/ |title=National Resource Centre for Dance website |accessdate=14 September 2016 |date=September 2016 |publisher=University of Surrey |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624134515/http://www.surrey.ac.uk/nrcd/ |archive-date=24 June 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
. All full-time courses lead towards further and higher education qualifications validated by either the [[University of Surrey]] or [[Trinity College London]].  A leading performing arts school, GSA is recognised as a centre of excellence for Musical Theatre training alongside research specialisms in performance philosophy and contemporary theatre practice. The Centre for Performance Philosophy (CCP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surrey.ac.uk/schoolofarts/research/centre_for_performance_philosophy/ |title=Centre for Performance Philosophy |accessdate=20 September 2016 |date=September 2016 |publisher=University of Surrey |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001201000/http://www.surrey.ac.uk/schoolofarts/research/centre_for_performance_philosophy/ |archive-date=1 October 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; led by Dr. Laura Cull Ó Maoilearca, was founded in 2016 as part of the school's Institute of Performance.

Until November 2009, the School occupied several sites in central Guildford, with facilities including drama, dance and music studios, technical workshops, IT facilities, a specialist library and resource centre, a wardrobe department, rehearsal rooms and two in-house theatres. As part of its merger with the University of Surrey, the school has moved to a completely new building which houses all faculties of the school on one site on the university campus. Peter Barlow, GSA Director (until December 2010), was handed the keys by project manager David Austin ([[VolkerFitzpatrick]]) on 13 November 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conservatoire.org/home/index.php?dept=21&amp;s=432&amp;id=499 |title=New building – we have the keys! |accessdate=20 November 2009 |date=November 2009 |publisher=Guildford School of Acting |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213200848/http://www.conservatoire.org/home/index.php?dept=21&amp;s=432&amp;id=499 |archivedate=13 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; marking a new era for GSA, with the first classes at the new building started on 16 November. The relocation was completed in late 2011 with the opening of the Ivy Performing Arts Centre.

The school stages regular private and public performances at both The Ivy Arts Centre and other venues in Guildford and in the UK.

In 2015 the school added a course in Actor-Musicianship which will produce its first graduates in 2018.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Following a re-structure in 2016, GSA now includes the well-established programmes in Theatre &amp; Performance, and Dance which had previously been part of the university's School of Arts. This will produce its first graduates in 2019.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="998">'''International Exhibition of Art''' ({{Lang-it|Esposizione internazionale d'arte}}) was a [[world's fair]] held in [[Rome]] in 1911 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]] in the same year as another [[Turin International|world's fair]] in Turin (which had a more scientific focus).  It marked the beginnings of the [[National Roman Museum]].  The fair's receipts were disappointing over the summer of 1911 because of poor weather and a [[cholera]] epidemic.  

The British Pavilion from it, designed by British architect Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]], was in 1912 taken over by the [[British School at Rome]], who still holds it.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Petter. ''Lutyens in Italy: The Building of the British School at Rome.'' British School at Rome, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Deahr’s childhood training began in Arlington Heights, IL training primarily in jazz, ballet and hip hop. Upon earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology with a minor in dance from [[Illinois Wesleyan University]], her early career continued as a trainee scholarship recipient of the Joel Hall Dance Center in [[Chicago]], IL&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iwu.edu/magazine/2017/spring/deahr-dance.html "Guest choreographer Jessica Deahr ’04 stretches dance students to their limits." IWU Magazine 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In addition to teaching and modeling, as a professional dancer Deahr worked as a company member of James Morrow’s “Instruments of Movement” from 2007-2009 while guest performing for [[Harrison McEldowney]] and Frank Chaves among others. Combining both her creative range and commercial interests, Deahr performed for artists [[Nelly]], [[Vanilla Ice]], [[Jump Smokers]] and [[DJ Pauly D]] while contracting with [[Royal Caribbean International]] as both a dancer and ariel artist, performing domestically as well as across Europe, Asia and South America&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20130530/entlife/705319989/ "Suburban Choreographer Didn't Expect a Career in Dance" Daily Herald 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Chicago Dance Crash==
Deahr’s first work with the Chicago-based contemporary company, [[Chicago Dance Crash]], was a supporting role in the 2007 production of ''Tiger Prawn: The Mountain Mover''.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Almeida|first1=Fabrizio|title=Review: Tiger Prawn: The Mountain Mover/ Chicago Dance Crash|work=Newcity|date=July 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoted as remembering “I had a black sock over my head, was kind of in the background… didn’t care. I was just so excited to be part of something that seemed to fit. &lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/115537858 "History of Crash: 2001-2015" staff interviews]&lt;/ref&gt;,” she continued guest work with the organization until being promoted to a company position by artistic director Kyle Vincent Terry in 2009. 
[[File:Jessica Deahr Fantasma.png|thumb|Deahr rehearsing a site-specific work. Photo by Kelly Stachura]]

Having successfully freelanced as a choreographer and upon Terry’s retirement, Deahr was named the company’s resident choreographer at the end of 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nevin|first=Johnny|title=Dance Crash, Deahr and the Art of Connection|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johnny-nevin/dance-crash-deahr-art_b_2564568.html|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As Crash operated without a formal artistic director for its 2012, tenth anniversary season, Deahr directed and choreographed the season’s signature production, ''Gotham City'' (inspired by the setting of [[Batman]] comic lore), which was later recognized by the [[Chicago Tribune]] as one of Chicago’s 10 best productions performed that year&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-12-13/entertainment/ct-ae-1216-best-dance-20121213_1_hubbard-street-dance-chicago-harris-theater-gustavo-ramirez-sansano "Dances from 2012 that Linger in Memory" Chicago Tribune, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;. She was internally acknowledged as the company’s artistic director throughout the 2012 season, with her promotion publicly announced to the audience at the company’s final performance of the year on November 17th&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zweR-qq2YrY&amp;index=9&amp;list=PLZa1beqMe01Zx3Z1YPJUxLHMagXF58e_e "Announcing our new Artistic Director" Chicago Dance Crash  youtube channel]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Artistic Director ===
Deahr is both the youngest and first female artistic director in the history of the organization. 
"Yeah I think it was kind of cool because when a company gets a new artistic director they come from somewhere 'here they are, meet them.' So that was slightly terrifying but also kind of cool because I knew them so well. So was cool to come... with a vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/115537858 "History of Crash: 2001-2015" staff interviews]&lt;/ref&gt;" 

As artistic director, Deahr has most notably expanded Crash’s Chicago-based educational outreach arm&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbangateways.org/qa-with-chicago-dance-crash-promoting-art-for-all-from-schools-to-the-modern-wing/ "Q+A with Chicago Dance Crash: Promoting Art for All, from Schools to the Modern Wing" Urban Gateways 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; while taking the organization beyond the state of Illinois both nationally and internationally. Her full-length works including ''The Cotton Mouth Club,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zacher|first1=Scotty|title=Review: The Cotton Mouth Club (Chicago Dance Crash)|work=Chicago Theater Beat|date=May 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Evil &amp; Good''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/dance/ct-chicago-dance-crash-good-evil-ent-0711-20160710-column.html "Chicago Dance Crash plunges into ''Evil &amp; Good''" Chicago Tribune July 9, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;, and ''The Bricklayers of Oz''&lt;ref&gt;[https://dancermusic.com/chicago-dance-crash-and-the-bricklayers-of-oz/ "Chicago Dance Crash and the Bricklayers of Oz" DancerMusic.com July 27, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; (inspired by [[The Land of Oz]] books by [[L. Frank Baum]]) have received critical acclaim while seeing extended tours.
[[File:The Bricklayers of Oz1.jpg|thumb|Deahr performing in Dance Crash's production of "The Bricklayers of Oz"]]

==Critical Reception &amp; Awards==
Consistently, Deahr's work has been well received by American midwest and national press, starting with her first professional work on Crash earning the "New Voice Award" from the 2011 Dance Chicago Festival as well as being unveiled to the national public as “brash, funky, bright and street friendly in style.” by the Chicago Tribune&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dancechicago.com/documents/CRASHSIDSMITHREVIE.pdf "Chicago Dance Crash offers ''RadioStars''" SeeChicagoDance.com 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;. Taking an interest in Deahr's career, the [[Huffington Post]] noted in 2013 that “Deahr's versatility isn't at all an end in itself; it seems more to be her way of discovering an artistic expression that can go more places, because it's been more places. While many artists see an uncomfortable contradiction between artistic expression and audience approval, Deahr sees both parts of that apparent conflict with more clarity and in a more complete context. One of the secrets of Deahr's vision is that because she can see more of it, she can see right through it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/johnny-nevin/dance-crash-deahr-art_b_2564568.html "Dance Crash, Deahr and the Art of Connection" The Huffington Post January 29, 2013] &lt;/ref&gt;” In 2017, [[Dance Magazine]] awarded her full-length work ''The Bricklayers of Oz'' as "The Most Inventive New Work of 2017"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Best of 2017|journal=Dance Magazine|date=December 2017|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] declared  “There is something about Jessica Deahr’s ingenious new hip-hop dance-theater piece that is so imaginative, so playfully revisionist, and so superbly realized by all the artists involved, that it feels like an instant classic all its own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/repaving-the-yellow-brick-road-in-ingenious-bricklayers-of-oz/ "Repaving the Yellow Brick Road in ingenious ''Bricklayers of Oz''" Chicago Sun-Times August 6, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;” Additionally, Deahr has been acknowledged as among the "Best in Dance" by the Chicago Tribune,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Sid|title=Sid Smith's Best in Dance 2012|work=The Chicago Tribune|date=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a "Top Artist" by Dance Magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whittenberg|first1=Zachary|title=Top Artists Confess their Guilty Pleasures|work=Dance Magazine|date=February 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as a featured artist in IWU Magazine&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iwu.edu/magazine/2017/spring/deahr-dance.html "Guest choreographer Jessica Deahr ’04 stretches dance students to their limits" IWU Magazine Spring, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[New York Times]] best-selling book "Dancers Among Us&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/29647160 "Dancers Among Us in Chicago - Sunrise at Oak St Beach" Vimeo]&lt;/ref&gt;."

The '''Jewish view on birth control''' currently varies between the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] branches of Judaism. Among Orthodox Judaism, use of birth control has been considered only acceptable for use in limited circumstances. Conservative Judaism, while generally encouraging its members to follow the traditional Jewish views on birth control has been more willing to allow greater exceptions regarding its use to fit better within modern society. Reform Judaism has generally been the most liberal with regard to birth control allowing individual followers to use their own judgment in what, if any, birth control methods they might wish to employ.

Regulations regarding contraception affect the traditional streams of Judaism (including the [[Haredi]] and [[Modern Orthodox]] varieties) more so than others because of their strict adherence to Halakhah, or Jewish law.  These regulations affect liberal strains of Judaism (including the Reform, Reconstructionist, and Conservative movements; particularly in Western society) much less, where the emphasis is on applying [[Halakhah]] to modern life rather than observing it strictly.  Many modern Jews feel that the benefits of contraception, be they female health, family stability, or disease prevention, uphold the commandment in Judaism to "choose life" much more strongly than they violate the commandment to "[[Cultural mandate|be fruitful and multiply]]".

==Orthodox Judaism==
Among traditional interpretations of the [[Torah]], active prevention of pregnancy is in violation of the commandment "be fruitful and multiply" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|1:28|HE}}). Some [[Rabbi|Rabbinic authorities]]{{who|date=November 2012}} further consider the possibility (generally not accepted) that a union that by definition cannot lead to pregnancy would amount to "spilling seed", the sin of [[Onan]] ( {{bibleverse||Genesis|38:9-10|HE}}).  A woman’s obligation being overridden in Jewish law by the danger of childbirth which opens up the option of them taking steps toward preventing pregnancy.

The option of contraception is raised by the [[Talmud]] ([http://www.come-and-hear.com/yebamoth/yebamoth_12.html#PARTb tractate Yevamot 12b]), where the use of a [[Pessary#Occlusive pessaries|pessary]] is discussed for women who are too young to get pregnant, presently pregnant, or nursing. In each case, either the woman or her child is at risk for serious complications, and this is the basis for many [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic authorities]] permitting contraception in situations where pregnancy would seriously harm the woman. In those cases, the most "natural" method is preferred; as the use of a condom or pessary creates a physical barrier, "[[combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]]" (or an [[intrauterine device]]) is preferred by most authorities. [[Fertility awareness]] methods (modern improvements over the [[calendar-based methods|rhythm method]]) are difficult to use, because many infertile days coincide with the ritually impure days of [[niddah]].

Orthodox rabbis believe that the positive commandment of being fruitful and multiplying is a male obligation. Consequently, wives may choose abstinence as birth control, but husbands are not permitted to decline their wives if they are not in niddah.

Contraceptive measures that lead to male sterility, are not ever permitted for their interfering with a man's obligation, only ever being permitted in life-threatening circumstances for the man such as some forms of cancer.  For example, a crushed or mangled man may not be permitted to marry anyone but a convert under Jewish law, and halachic authorities see [[vasectomy]] as a form of maiming, even if already married to a non-convert becoming maimed intentionally or accidentally including an vasectomy does obligate divorce unless a successful repair surgery is performed and sperm flow is returned (based on [[Deuteronomy]] {{bibleverse-nb||Deuteronomy|23:2|HE}}).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aish.com/atr/Vasectomy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

When Orthodox Jewish couples contemplate the use of contraceptives, they generally consult a [[rabbi]] competent on this topic who evaluates the need for the intervention and which method is preferable from a ''[[halakha|halachic]]'' point of view.

The Midrash of Genesis speaks of the origins of oral contraceptives: "In the early time of creation, in the time of Lemech, a medicine was known, the taking of which prevented a woman's conception."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/mhl/mhl05.htm Genesis Rabba 23 p.56]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inasmuch as the strict letter of the law, as understood by classic authorities, does not obligate the fathering of limitless number of children beyond the requirement to produce at least one child of each gender or according to another opinion until two male offspring are born, there is wide latitude within halacha to limit family sizes, although usage of contraception varies from community to community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Contraception.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Modern Orthodox authorities are inclined to permit contraception for a broad array of reasons, with some arguing that a couple may decide to delay procreation even without specific rabbinic permission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yctorah.org/component/option,com_docman/task,doc_view/gid,1398/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hormonal contraception==
Generally, the introduction of [[hormonal contraception]] in the 1960s did not cause the stir within [[Judaism|Jewish]] circles that it caused in other religious groups. A number of [[responsa]] from rabbinic decisors (''[[posek|poskim]]'') outlined the proper approach to the new phenomenon.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} There has been little talk of the potential risk of increased [[promiscuity]] (''z'nut'').{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

An innovative use of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] in Judaism is employed by some young brides. The laws of [[family purity]] prohibit sexual intercourse while a woman is menstruating (see ''[[niddah]]''). In order to decrease the chance of [[menstruation]] occurring just before (or on) the wedding night, some brides briefly regulate their periods in the months leading up to their [[wedding]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Showroom==
[[Image:Jordan River Foundation Showroom.jpg|thumb|The main entrance of the showroom.]]Located on [[Jabal Amman]], the Jordan River Foundation showroom occupies the house built in the 1936&lt;ref name=houseplaque&gt;Jordan River Foundation house plaque. Jordan River Foundation, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; by Salim al-Odat.&lt;ref name=housebook&gt;{{cite book|title=Old Houses of Jordan|publisher=TURAB, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odat rented the house to the British army throughout the 1930s to be used as offices. He sold it in 1939, after which it went through a number of owners in which it was used as a house, a police station, and a school during the 1960s. But in the 1980s, the house was abandoned and fell into disrepair.&lt;ref name=housebook/&gt; Then, at the end of the decade, when a potential buyer threatened to tear down the house, architect Zaid al-Qoussous bought it so as to preserve the house. In 1994, the house was bought and renovated by the Jordan River Foundation to be used as their showroom.&lt;ref name=housebook/&gt; Several companies and embassies contributed to the renovation:&lt;ref name=houseplaque /&gt;

== Management ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}
Since its inception, Her Majesty [[Queen Rania Al-Abdullah]] has been involved in all aspects of JRF’s development. As the Chairperson of the Board of Trustees, she chairs Board meetings and provides visionary leadership to ensure the existence of long-term, impact-oriented programs. 
The Foundation’s Board of Trustees consists of individuals from the public, private and non-profit sectors who provide valuable leadership and expertise while working in close coordination with the Director General and staff to ensure the strategic development of JRF. The Board oversees and monitors the implementation of all JRF projects, as well as refines administrative and financial systems and procedures. One of the Board’s major responsibilities is to ensure that the Foundation operates with fiscally sound and ethically accepted accounting and management practices, thus ensuring the Foundation’s transparency and accountability at all times.
JRF's successful management is shaped by an executive team led by the Director General who harnesses the capabilities and expertise of employees to ensure demand-driven implementation and facilitation of its programs and activities.
The Foundation employs 137 experienced staff to manage its programs, centers and services. These qualified individuals participate in continuous training and capacity building activities to enhance their knowledge and skills, creating a dedicated cadre. In addition to the staff, 35 volunteers devote their time and efforts in fundraising activities through annual and ad noc special events. They are also involved in development projects that mobilize community members to address specific needs and priorities. 
The current Director General is [[Enaam Barrishi]].

'''''Madonna in Glory with Seraphim''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Sandro Botticelli]], executed c. 1469-1470. It is housed in [[Galleria degli Uffizi|Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence]].

Some panel paintings of the Madonna by Botticelli remain from the years around 1470 which are striking expressions of Botticelli's stylistic development. Two full figure pictures of the Madonna - the ''Madonna in Glory'' and the ''Madonna of the Rosegarden'' - are in the Uffizi. They represent monumental seated figures filling the entire picture.

Mary is enthroned on clouds in a glory of seraphim. The Christ Child, with the cruciform nimbus, is looking towards the observer and raising his hand in blessing. Botticelli has succeeded in expressing the tensions in this theme with sensitivity: the mother, who is fully aware of the Passion her son will suffer, is holding him protectively in her arms.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

The '''Quito School''' ('''''Escuela Quiteña''''') is a [[Latin American]] artistic tradition that constitutes essentially the whole of the professional artistic output developed in the territory of the [[Royal Audience of Quito]] — from [[Pasto]] and [[Popayán]] in the north to [[Piura]] and [[Cajamarca]] in the south — during the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period (1542-1824)]].&lt;ref&gt;Ximena Escudero-Albornoz and Ximena Escudero de Terán.

Ediciones del Banco de los Andes (1992). {{ISBN|9978-82-293-3}}, {{ISBN|978-9978-82-293-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially associated with the 17th and 18th centuries and was almost exclusively focused on the religious art of the [[Catholic Church]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Handelsman, Michael (2000), ''Culture and Customs of Ecuador'' (Series: Culture and Customs of Latin America and the Caribbean; Series editor: Peter Standish); Westport, Connecticut/London: Greenwood Press, pg 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Characterized by a mastery of the realistic and by the degree to which indigenous beliefs and artistic traditions are evident, these productions were among of the most important activities in the economy of the Royal Audience of Quito.&lt;ref&gt;Christiana Renate Borchart de Moreno. ''La Audiencia de Quito: aspectos económicos y sociales (siglos XVI-XVIII)''. Editorial Abya Yala (1998). {{ISBN|9978-72-084-7}}, {{ISBN|978-9978-72-084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the prestige of the movement even in Europe that it was said that [[King Carlos III]] of Spain (1716–1788), referring to one of its sculptors in particular, opined: "I am not concerned that Italy has [[Michelangelo]]; in my colonies of America I have the master [[Caspicara]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rivas, Julio (2012), [http://www.clave.com.ec/index.php?idSeccion=785|fechaacceso=05/03/2013 ''Un sitio llamado San Francisco'']; ''Revista Clave!'', Nov-Dec issue. [''No me preocupa que Italia tenga a [[Miguel Ángel]], en mis colonias de América yo tengo al maestro Caspicara.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Quito School originated in the school of Artes y Oficios, founded in 1552 by the Franciscan priest [[Jodoco Ricke]], who together with Friar [[Pedro Bedon]] transformed the San Andrés seminary, where the first indigenous artists were trained. As a cultural expression, it is the result of a long process of acculturation between indigenous peoples and Europeans, and it is one of the richest expressions of [[Mestizo|miscegenation (''mestizaje'')]] and of [[syncretism]], in which the participation of the vanquished Indian is seemingly of minor importance as compared to the dominant European contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Ximena Escudero Albornoz and José María Vargas Arévalo. ''Historia y crítica del Arte Hispanoamericano, Real Audiencia de Quito: (siglos XVI, XVII y XVIII)''. Editorial Abya Yala (2000). {{ISBN|9978-04-562-7}}, {{ISBN|978-9978-04-562-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
As a product of cultural syncretism and miscegenation, the works of the Quito School are characterized by the combination and adaptation of European and Indigenous features. In its development, it reflected the styles prevailing in each period of Spain and thus contains [[renaissance]] and [[Mannerism|mannerist]] elements. During its height, it was eminently [[baroque]], concluding with a short [[rococo]] period leading to an incipient [[neoclassicism]] until the transition to the [[History of Ecuador (1830–60)|republican period]]. The Quito School also incorporated [[Flemish]], [[Culture of Italy|Italian]], and [[Moorish]] influences.

One of the common characteristics of the school is the technique of ''encarnado'' ("flesh-colored") — the simulation of the color of the flesh of the [European] human body — that makes the skin of sculptures appear more natural. Once the piece was perfectly cut and sanded, an artisan covered the wood with several layers of [[gesso]] with glue. Each layer was highly polished to achieve a perfectly smooth finish. Next, color was applied in various transparent layers, allowing an optical mix of overlapping colors. This began with the colors of shadows (blue, green, ocher), then light colors were applied (white, pink, yellow). and finally highlight colors were added (orange and red to cheeks, knees, and elbows of children; and dark blue, green, and violet for wounds and bruises of Christ or for stubble on a beardless figure).

Other typical characteristics include:
*Serpentine representation of the movement of bodies, especially in sculpture
*Application of [[watercolor|''aguada'' (watercolor)]] on top of [[gold leaf]] or silver paint, giving a special metallic sheen

The features indicating its indigenous roots include:
* "Quiteñization" of characters, with mixed traits and local costumes
* Frequent appearance of ancestral indigenous customs
* Location of the scenes within the Andean countryside or cities
* Presence of local flora and fauna, and the substitution of local plants for traditional European iconography

'''Samuel Palmer''' (27 January 1805 – 24 May 1881) was a British [[Landscape art|landscape]] painter, [[etcher]] and [[printmaker]]. He was also a prolific writer. Palmer was a key figure in [[Romanticism]] in Britain and produced visionary pastoral paintings.

==Early life==
Palmer, who was born in Surrey Square off the [[Old Kent Road]] in [[Newington, London]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/britain/samuel_palmer/palmer_and_primitivism.aspx Samuel Palmer on the British Museum Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924051208/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/britain/samuel_palmer/palmer_and_primitivism.aspx |date=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the son of a bookseller and sometime [[Baptist]] minister, and was raised by a pious nurse. Palmer painted churches from around age twelve, and first exhibited [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|Turner]]-inspired works at the [[Royal Academy]] at the age of fourteen. He had little formal training, and little formal schooling, although he was educated briefly at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]].&lt;ref&gt;Minchin, J. G. C., ''Our public schools, their influence on English history; Charter house, Eton, Harrow, Merchant Taylors', Rugby, St. Paul's Westminster, Winchester'' (London, 1901), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shoreham==
[[File:Samuel Palmer 002.jpg|left|thumbnail|234px|''In a Shoreham Garden''. 1820s or early 1830s]]
Through [[John Linnell (1792)|John Linnell]], he met [[William Blake]] in 1824.  Blake's influence can be seen in work he produced over the next ten years and generally reckoned to be his greatest. The works were landscapes around [[Shoreham, Kent|Shoreham]], near Sevenoaks in the west of [[Kent]]. He purchased a run-down cottage, nicknamed "Rat Abbey", and lived there from 1826 to 1835, depicting the area as a demi-paradise, mysterious and visionary, often shown in sepia shades under moon and star light. There Palmer associated with a group of Blake-influenced artists known as [[Ancients (art group)|the Ancients]] (including [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]] and [[Edward Calvert (painter)|Edward Calvert]]).  They were among the few who saw the Shoreham paintings as, resulting from attacks by critics in 1825, he opened his early portfolios only to selected friends.

Palmer's somewhat disreputable father &amp;ndash; Samuel Palmer senior &amp;ndash; moved to the area, his brother Nathaniel having offered him an allowance that would "make him a gentleman" and restore the good name of the family.  Samuel Palmer senior rented half of the [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]]-era 'Waterhouse' which still stands by the [[River Darent]] at Shoreham and is now known as the 'Water House'. Palmer's nurse, Mary Ward, and his other son William joined him there. The Waterhouse was used to accommodate overflow guests from "Rat Abbey". In 1828 Samuel Palmer left "Rat Abbey" to join his father at Water House and lived there for the rest of his time in Shoreham. While at Shoreham he fell in love with the fourteen-year-old Hannah Linnell, whom he later married.

==Maturity==
[[File:Palmer. A Cornfield by Moonlight with the Evening Star. Watercolour with bodycolour and pen and ink c.1830..jpg|right|thumbnail|234px|''A Cornfield by Moonlight with the Evening Star'' c. 1830]]
After returning to London in 1835, and using a small legacy to purchase a house in [[Marylebone]], Palmer produced less mystical and more conventional work. Part of his reason in returning to London was to sell his work and earn money from private teaching. He had better health on his return to London, and was by then married to Hannah, daughter of the painter [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]] who he had known since she was a child, and married when she was nineteen and he was thirty-two. He sketched in [[Devon]]shire and Wales around this time. His peaceful vision of rural England had been disrupted by the [[Swing Riots|violent rural discontent]] of the early 1830s. His small financial legacy was running out and he decided to produce work more in line with public taste if he was to earn an income for himself and his wife. He was following the advice of his father-in-law. Linnell, who had earlier shown remarkable understanding of the uniqueness of [[William Blake]]'s genius, was not as generous with his son-in-law, towards whom his attitude was authoritarian and often harsh.

Palmer turned more to watercolour which was gaining popularity in England. To further a commercial career, the couple embarked on a two-year [[honeymoon]] to Italy, made possible by money from Hannah's parents in 1837. In Italy Palmer's palette became brighter, sometimes to the point of garishness, but he made many fine sketches and studies that would later be useful in producing new paintings. On his return to London, Palmer sought patrons with limited success. For more than two decades he was obliged to work as a private drawing master, until he moved from London in 1862. To add to his financial worries, he returned to London to find his dissolute brother William had pawned all his early paintings, and Palmer was obliged to pay a large sum to redeem them. By all accounts Palmer was an excellent teacher, but the work with uninspired students reduced the time he could devote to his own art.

==Later years==
From the early 1860s he gained some measure of critical success for his later landscapes, which had a touch of the early Shoreham work about them – most notable is the etching of ''The Lonely Tower'' (1879).  He became a full member of the [[Water Colour Society]] in 1854, and its annual show gave him a yearly goal to work towards.

[[File:Palmer. A Dream in the Appenine c.1864 (watercolor and gouache on paper laid on wood) Tate Britain.jpg|right|thumbnail|234px|''A Dream in the Apennine'' (c. 1864)]]

His best late works include a series of large watercolours illustrating [[John Milton|Milton]]'s poems ''[[L'Allegro]]'' and ''[[Il Penseroso]]'' and his etchings, a medium in which he worked from 1850 onwards, including a set illustrating [[Virgil]].

Palmer's later years were darkened by the death in 1861, at the age of 19, of his elder son Thomas More Palmer &amp;ndash; a devastating blow from which he never fully recovered. He lived in various places later in his life, including a small cottage and an unaffordable villa both in [[Kensington]], where he lived at 6 [[Drouro Place]],&lt;ref name="kensingtonpast114"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denny|first1=Barbara|last2=Starren|first2=Carolyn|title=Kensington Past|date=1998|publisher=Historical Publications|location=London, U.K.|isbn=9780948667503|oclc=42308455|page=114|quote=The residents were somewhat lower perhaps on the social scale, but many had distinguished artistic reputations such as the sculptor Alfred Stevens, at 7 Canning Place, and the painter, Samuel Palmer, at 6 Drouro Place, 1851–61.}}&lt;/ref&gt; then a cottage at [[Reigate]]. But it was only when a small measure of financial security came his way, that was he able to move to Furze Hill House in Redhill, Surrey, from 1862.  He could not afford to have a daily newspaper delivered to Redhill, suggesting that his financial circumstances there were still tight.

Samuel Palmer died in [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], Surrey, and is buried with his wife in Reigate churchyard.

==Legacy==

Palmer was largely forgotten after his death. In 1909, many of his Shoreham works were destroyed by his surviving son Alfred Herbert Palmer, who burnt "a great quantity of father's handiwork ... Knowing that no one would be able to make head or tail of what I burnt; I wished to save it from a more humiliating fate".  The destruction included "sketchbooks, notebooks, and original works, and lasted for days". It wasn't until 1926 that Palmer's rediscovery began through a show curated by Martin Hardie at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], ''Drawings, Etchings and Woodcuts made by Samuel Palmer and other Disciples of William Blake''. But it took until the early 1950s for his reputation to recover, stimulated by [[Geoffrey Grigson]]'s 280-page book ''Samuel Palmer'' (1947) and later by an exhibition of the Shoreham work in 1957 and by Grigson's 1960 selection of Palmer's writing.  His reputation rests mainly on his Shoreham work, but some of his later work has recently received more appreciation.

The Shoreham work has had a powerful influence on many English artists after being rediscovered. Palmer was a notable influence on [[F. L. Griggs]], [[Robin Tanner]], [[Graham Sutherland]], [[Paul Drury]], [[Joseph Webb]], [[Eric Ravilious]], [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]], the glass engraving of [[Laurence Whistler]], and [[Clifford Harper]]. He also inspired a resurgence in twentieth-century landscape printmaking, which began amongst students at Goldsmiths' College in the 1920s. (See: Jolyon Drury, 2006)

In 2005 the [[British Museum]] collaborated with the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] to stage the first major retrospective of his work, timed to coincide with the bicentenary of Palmer's birth. The show ran from October 2005 to January 2006, and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, March &amp;ndash; May 2006.

The popularity of genealogy, encouraged by the increasing use of the [[Internet]] is encouraging a number of people to mass-market what authorities regard as '''scam "genealogical books"''' which are sometimes promoted by affiliated websites. They tend to contain a general introduction, a section about the origin of surnames in general, a section about heraldry, a couple of blank charts for the purchaser to copy and complete once he has done his own research, a few recipes and (sometimes) a list of names, addresses and telephone numbers culled from the publicly available telephone directories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancestry.com/library/view/columns/eastman/3538.asp Ancestry.com - Genealogy Scams&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The books are not unique to a particular surname, are not published annually and contain no pictures of the buyer's family members. In a recent case, Jeffery Scism, a San Bernardino, California genealogist, said the fines for such practises are puny when compared with the hundreds of thousands of dollars he believes such vendors rake in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/other_business/article/0,2777,DRMN_23916_4455021,00.html Album seller settles case : More Business : The Rocky Mountain News]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109075556/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/other_business/article/0,2777,DRMN_23916_4455021,00.html |date=January 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting''''', also known as '''''Autoritratto in veste di Pittura''''' or simply '''''La Pittura''''', was painted by the Italian Baroque artist [[Artemisia Gentileschi]]. The oil-on-canvas painting measures {{Convert|96.5|x|73.7|cm}} and was probably produced during Gentileschi’s stay in England between 1638 and 1639. It was in the collection of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and was returned to the [[Royal Collection]] at the Restoration (1660) and remains there.  In 2015 it was put on display in the "Cumberland Gallery" in [[Hampton Court Palace]].

The scene depicts Gentileschi painting herself, who is in turn represented as the “Allegory of Painting” illustrated by [[Cesare Ripa]]. It is now in the British [[Royal Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting (La Pittura)|url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?maker=12024&amp;object=405551&amp;row=0&amp;detail=about|work=Royal Collection|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting demonstrates rare feminist themes from a time when women seldom held jobs, let alone were well known for them. Gentileschi’s portrayal of herself as the epitome of the arts was a bold statement to make for the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=France|first=Sarah|title=Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting|url=http://rebirthofreason.com/Spirit/Art/129.shtml|work=Rebirth of Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the painting is today overshadowed by many of Gentileschi’s other, more dramatic and raw scenes reflecting the artist’s troubling younger years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages|year=2005|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|pages=661–662|edition=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Self-Portrait'' was very controversial in its time.

That it is a [[self-portrait]] as well as an allegory was first proposed by [[Michael Levey]] in the 20th century, and is not universally accepted, as some art historians see the features of the figure here as too different from those in other portraits of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, 374&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
Gentileschi was born in Rome in 1593, just at the start of [[Baroque painting]].  Gentileschi’s father, [[Orazio Gentileschi|Orazio]], was a well-known artist, and Artemisia trained in his workshop for a number of years before creating works herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages|year=2005|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|pages=661–662|edition=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1610s, Artemisia was raped by a somewhat older member of the workshop, Agostino Tassi, an event which coloured the rest of her life and is reflected in her art, which often shows subjects with a "[[Power of Women]]" themes such as  ''[[Judith Slaying Holofernes (Artemisia Gentileschi)|Judith Slaying Holofernes]]'' and ''Salome with the Head of St. John the Baptist''. The artist's focus on her work, away from the viewer, highlights the drama of the Baroque period, and the changing role of the artist from craftsperson to singular innovator.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Borzello, ''Seeing Ourselves: Women's Self-Portraiture'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstract concepts like "Painting" were traditionally represented by female allegorical figures, and therefore the painting was not one that any male painter could present in the same way, as both [[self-portrait]] and [[allegory]].  The ''Self-Portrait'' was also influenced by the works of Cesare Ripa, most notably his ''Iconologia'', in which he suggests how virtues and abstract concepts should be depicted, with human qualities and appearances.  Ripa said "Painting" should be shown as: “A beautiful woman, with full black hair, disheveled, and twisted in various ways, with arched eyebrows that show imaginative thought, the mouth covered with a cloth tied behind her ears, with a chain of gold at her throat from which hangs a mask, and has written in front "imitation." She holds in her hand a brush, and in the other the palette, with clothes of evanescently covered drapery.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lester|first=Maureen|title=Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting (La Pittura)|url=https://ritdml.rit.edu/bitstream/handle/1850/6095/MLesterKearse2007.pdf?sequence=1|work=Women and the Visual Arts|date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than the cloth tied around the mouth, Gentileschi follows this prescription quite accurately.

==Description==
The composition of the painting mirrors other artworks of the time, using diagonal lines to flaunt the female figure and emphasize her movement both in toward the canvas and out towards the viewers. The use of foreshortening and other three-dimensional techniques not only demonstrate Gentileschi’s talent as an artist, but also bring the viewers into the painting on physical and emotional levels.

The light is clearly coming from the left, but the source is not visible and is unusually harsh. The front of Gentileschi’s body is lit perfectly, but her back is obscured. Across the forehead and cheeks and down the side of the neck and left shoulder a clear line separates the light from the dark, a [[chiaroscuro]] technique which was used frequently during the Baroque era to add a sense of drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Machado|first=John|title=Gentileschi's Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting|url=http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/gentileschi-self-portrait|work=Smart History |author2=John Machado |author3=Denise Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The textural element, so important in Baroque paintings, is found in the wisps in the disheveled hair, the crinkles in the sleeve with spilled paint cracking near the wrist, and the dirty hands, which augment the painting's realism.

Finally, the colour in the portrait is noteworthy, partially due to the lighting and partially due to the natural difference in tones. Whereas the darker clothing and background nearly seem to blend together, the pale skin of the face and right arm jump out immediately. The gold chain near the neck shimmers, while the chain near the chest (ending in a mask pendant) slowly dies down into a lacklustre brown.

==Interpretation==
Because Ripa’s image of “Painting” took the form of a woman, Gentileschi could use the description to her advantage to paint herself in the best light as an artist. While being a female during the Baroque era was largely negative in terms of rights and lifestyle, Gentileschi found this gem in ''Ideologia'' to amp up her reputation. Additionally, although many of the idealized figures of women evoked salacious or suggestive ideas during this time, Gentileschi was able to successfully manipulate “Painting” to be empowering (not demeaning) to women.

Gentileschi’s depiction of herself as the Allegory of Painting has made her seem somewhat egotistical to some critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=France|first=Sarah|title=Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting|url=http://rebirthofreason.com/Spirit/Art/129.shtml|work=Rebirth of Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representing oneself as the epitome of an idea is certainly a huge claim, and it may seem that Gentileschi is proclaiming herself as one of the most magnificent artists, though she was still relatively unknown at the time. However, Gentileschi’s portrayal of herself as the Allegory should be looked at as a positive, showing the world what a woman could do, rather than just Gentileschi as an artist. Furthermore, as art historian [[Mary Garrard]] claims, only a woman artist could present herself in this way, as allegorical figures were limited to the bodies of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garrard|first1=Mary |authorlink=Mary Garrard|title=Artemisia Gentileschi's Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting|journal=[[College Art Association|The Art Bulletin]]|date=1980| volume=62|issue=1|pages=97–112|jstor=3049963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''La Desintegración de la Persistencia de la Memoria''''' or '''''The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory''''' is an oil on canvas painting by the Spanish [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[Salvador Dalí]]. It is a 1954 re-creation of the artist's famous 1931 work ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', and measures a diminutive 25.4 × 33&amp;nbsp;cm. It was originally known as ''The Chromosome of a Highly-coloured Fish's Eye Starting the Harmonious Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory'', and first exhibited at the Carstairs Gallery in New York in 1954.&lt;ref name=Liquid-Tush&gt;{{cite book|author=Tush, Peter|title=Salvador Dalí - Liquid Desire|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|location=Melbourne, Victoria|year=2009|pages=260–61|isbn=9780724103072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In this version, the landscape from the original work has been flooded with water. Disintegration depicts what is occurring both above and below the water's surface. The landscape of [[Cadaqués]] is now hovering above the water. The plane and block from the original is now divided into brick-like shapes that float in relation to each other, with nothing binding them. These represent the breakdown of matter into atoms, a revelation in the age of [[quantum mechanics]]. Behind the bricks, the horns receding into the distance symbolise atomic missiles, highlighting that despite cosmic order, humanity could bring about its own destruction. The dead olive tree from which the soft watch hangs has also begun to break apart.&lt;ref name=Liquid-Tush/&gt;&lt;!-- cites previous four sentences --&gt; The hands of the watches float above their dials, with several conical objects floating in parallel formations encircling the watches. A fourth melting watch has been added. The distorted human visage from the original painting is beginning to morph into another of the strange fish floating above it. To Dalí, however, the fish was a symbol of life.

==Background==
Dalí had been greatly interested in nuclear physics since the first [[Manhattan Project|atomic bomb explosions of August 1945]], and described the atom as his "favourite food for thought". Recognising that matter was made up of atoms which did not touch each other, he sought to replicate this in his art at the time, with items suspended and not interacting with each other, such as in ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]''.&lt;ref name=Liquid-King&gt;{{cite book|author=King, Elliott H.|title=Salvador Dalí - Liquid Desire|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|location=Melbourne, Victoria|year=2009|pages=247|isbn=9780724103072}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Dalí, this image was symbolic of the new physics—the quantum world which exists as [[wave-particle duality|both particles and waves]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The imagery of the original ''Persistence of Memory'' can be read as a representation of Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] (although Dalí himself denied the connection to the theory), symbolizing the relativity of time and space. In this new work, quantum mechanics is symbolized by "digitizing" the old image.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Dalí symbolised and marked the loss of his interest in surrealism with ''The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory'' as his interest in nuclear physics and religion led him elsewhere.&lt;ref name="McNeese"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tim McNeese, Salvador Dalí|title=Salvador Dalí|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2006|pages=100|isbn=0791088375|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pW8i2a-hgeYC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=%22Galatea+of+the+Spheres%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KDSSTZueJoLCcenTqYkH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Galatea%20of%20the%20Spheres%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is currently owned by the [[Salvador Dalí Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]. It was transported to and exhibited at the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in Melbourne in 2009, along with many other Dalí paintings in the ''Liquid Desire'' exhibition.&lt;ref name=Liquid&gt;{{cite book|title=Salvador Dalí - Liquid Desire|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|location=Melbourne, Victoria|year=2009|pages=321|isbn=9780724103072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Glass Shield''''' is a 1995 American [[crime film|crime]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Charles Burnett (director)|Charles Burnett]].  It stars [[Michael Boatman]] and [[Lori Petty]] as rookie police officers who uncover a conspiracy around the arrest of a suspect ([[Ice Cube]]).  After a festival run, it was released in the United States on June 2, 1995, and grossed $3.3 million.

==Plot==
John "J. J." Johnson is a rookie deputy sheriff in the [[Los Angeles Sheriff's Department]].  Because of his inexperience and race, he  experiences tension with his white colleagues as their first black deputy.  Although he initially clashes with Deputy Deborah Fields, the department's first female deputy, they strike up a friendship.  While on patrol, Johnson backs up Deputy Bono when he stops a black man, Teddy Woods, at a gas station.  When Bono runs Woods' drivers license, he finds a warrant for his arrest.  Woods reveals he has a stolen pistol in his car, and the police officers arrest him.

Deputy Fields is the second deputy to the scene of a murder, but Detectives Baker and Hall dismiss her observations.  Mr. Greenspan says a black man murdered his wife in a botched robbery, and the detectives pressure Woods to confess after they trace his stolen pistol to the murder.  Woods defiantly proclaims his innocence, frustrating his lawyer, James Locket, who advises him to show less attitude in court.  At the same time, community activist Reverend Banks raises awareness of the death of a black prisoner whom he believes to have been murdered by the police while in custody.  Johnson dismisses the concerns of his family and girlfriend, saying there is no evidence of this.

While coaching Bono on what to say at the trial, Johnson's commander, Clarence Massey, learns that Bono stopped Woods because of his race.  Frustrated, Massey instructs him to come up with a better excuse.  Bono suggests a traffic violation and later requests that Johnson back him up.  Johnson agrees, and Massey praises him for his loyalty and dependability while chastising Fields for her refusal to fit in better.  At the trial, Locket points out holes in the police testimony, making Johnson wonder if he made the right decision.  Fields joins Johnson in investigating what really happened.  With help from a whistleblower, they discover numerous cover-ups that involve Baker, Hall, and Massey.

As the trial progresses and Greenspan's testimony proves problematic, Massey has Baker murder Greenspan to prevent him from becoming a liability.  Hall, sick from cancer, dies at the station.  Tensions rise as Johnson and Fields continue pursuing their own investigation, and they become further paranoid when Johnson insists they were intentionally given faulty intelligence during a drug raid.  After Fields is hospitalized following an assault, Johnson and Baker come to blows.  Massey breaks them up and temporarily places Johnson in a jail cell.  When released, he delivers incriminating evidence to Locket that implicates Baker in various crimes, including the murder of the black prisoner and framing Woods.

The jury can not reach a verdict.  Facing a widespread investigation of police corruption that goes to the city council and mayor's office, the district attorney offers to drop the charges against Woods.  Locket, with the reluctant backing of a city councilman, instead pushes for a new trial, which the judge accepts.  Bono turns state's evidence and testifies against Johnson, admitting that the two committed perjury.  Caught up in the probe, Johnson pleads guilty and receives a suspended sentence.  After the sheriff's department is disbanded, Massey retires, Baker is sentenced to four years and is in an honor prison while appealing. The unit is disbanded and the other officers including Bono are reassigned.

'''''The Gulf Stream''''' is an 1899 oil painting by [[Winslow Homer]]. It shows a man in a small dismasted rudderless fishing boat struggling against the waves of the sea, and was the artist's last statement on a theme that had interested him for more than a decade.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11122|title=Winslow Homer - The Gulf Stream - The Met|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homer vacationed often in Florida, Cuba, and the Caribbean.

==Background==
Homer crossed the [[Gulf Stream]] numerous times; his first trip to the Caribbean in 1885 seems to have inspired several related works dated from the same year, including a pencil drawing of a dismasted boat, a large watercolor ''The Derelict (Sharks)'', and a larger watercolor of the forward part of the boat, ''Study for "The Gulfstream"''.&lt;ref name="C"&gt;Cikovsky, 382&lt;/ref&gt; A later watercolor study was ''The Gulfstream'' of 1889, in which the disabled boat now includes a sailor and flailing shark. Additionally, there are other related watercolors; the shark in ''Shark Fishing'' of 1885 was later appropriated for ''The Gulfstream'' of 1889,&lt;ref name="CO1"&gt;Cooper, 143&lt;/ref&gt; and a watercolor of 1899 entitled ''After the Hurricane'', in which a figure lies unconscious beside his beached boat, represents the finale of the watercolor narrative of man against nature.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 215-216&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Winslow Homer - After the Hurricane, Bahamas.jpg|thumb|left|''After the Hurricane'', painted by Homer in 1899, depicts a man washed up on a beach after a storm.]]

Another possible inspiration for the series of watercolors and ''The Gulf Stream'' itself was ''McCabe's Curse'', a Bahamian tale about a British Captain McCabe who in 1814 was robbed by thieves, hired a small boat in hopes of reaching a nearby island, but was caught in a storm and later died in Nassau of yellow fever; Homer saved an account of the story and pasted it into a travel guide.&lt;ref name="CO1"/&gt;

A visit to Nassau and Florida between December 1898 and February 1899 immediately preceded the final painting.&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;Cikovsky, 369&lt;/ref&gt; Homer began work on the painting by September 1899, at which time he wrote: "I painted in water colors three months last winter at Nassau, &amp; have now just commenced arranging a picture from some of the studies."&lt;ref&gt;Spassky, 35-37&lt;/ref&gt; Chronologically the first of a series of major works painted by Homer in the last decade of his life, ''The Gulf Stream'' was painted in the penultimate year of the century, the year after the death of his father, and has been seen as revealing his sense of abandonment or vulnerability.&lt;ref name="C3"/&gt;

==Exhibition and reaction==
In 1900 Homer sent ''The Gulf Stream'' to Philadelphia to be exhibited at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]], and after it was returned later that year he wrote "I have painted on the picture since it was in Philadelphia and improved it very much (more of the Deep Sea water than before)."&lt;ref name="S"&gt;Spassky, 37&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, comparison with an early photograph of the painting shows that Homer not only reworked the ocean, but changed the starboard gunwale by breaking it, added the sail and the red dash of color near the waterline, made the boat's name (''Anna – Key West'') clearly legible, and painted in the ship at the upper left horizon&lt;ref name="S"/&gt;—possibly to mitigate the sense of desolation in the work.&lt;!--read this somewhere, can't find ref right now--&gt; He then showed the painting at the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Institute]] in Pittsburgh, and asked $4,000 for it.&lt;ref name="S"/&gt;

In 1906 ''The Gulf Stream'' was exhibited at the [[National Academy of Design]], and all the members of the academy's jury petitioned the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] to purchase the painting.&lt;ref name="S2"&gt;Spassky, 39&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper reviews of the work were mixed;&lt;ref name="S2"/&gt; it was seen as more melodramatic than Homer's usual work. A reviewer in Philadelphia noted that viewers had laughed at the painting, which he referred to as "Smiling Sharks", describing the scene as "a naked negro lying in a boat while a school of sharks [are] waltzing around him in the most ludicrous manner". Another contemporary critic wrote that ''The Gulf Stream'' "displays a certain diffusion of interest seldom seen in the canvases of [Homer's] best manner".&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Randall C. ''Homer, Eakins &amp; Anshutz: the search for American identity in the gilded age'', p. 103. Penn State Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-271-02329-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum bought the painting the same year.

==Interpretation and influences==
[[File:Watsonandtheshark-original.jpg|thumb|[[John Singleton Copley]], ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'', 1778]]

Homer's intentions for ''The Gulf Stream'' are opaque. The painting has been described as "a particularly enigmatic and tantalizing episode, a marine puzzle that floats forever in a region of unsolved mysteries."&lt;ref name="G"&gt;Gardner, 211&lt;/ref&gt; Bryson Burroughs, a onetime curator at the Metropolitan Museum, noted that it "assumes the proportion of a great allegory if one chooses".&lt;ref name="S3"&gt;Spassky, 41&lt;/ref&gt; Its drama is of a romantic and heroic vein, the man stoically resigned to fate, surrounded by anecdotal detail reminiscent of Homer's early illustrative works.&lt;ref name="S"/&gt;

When a viewer requested an explanation for the narrative, Homer fairly bristled in response:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I regret very much that I have painted a picture that requires any description....I have crossed the Gulf Stream ''ten times'' &amp; I should know something about it. The boat &amp; sharks are outside matters of very little consequence. ''They have been blown out to sea by a hurricane.'' You can tell these ladies that the unfortunate negro who now is so dazed &amp; parboiled, will be rescued &amp; returned to his friends and home, &amp; ever after live happily.&lt;ref&gt;Spassky, 38-39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCSZzevvwpwC&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=unfortunate%20negro%20who%20now%20is%20so%20dazed%20&amp;%20parboiled,%20will%20be%20rescued%20&amp;%20returned%20to%20his%20friends%20and%20home,%20&amp;%20ever%20after%20live%20happily.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Q-EHtw7B1e&amp;sig=UySqpDni-sMapAF6mLxB3eDyuPc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gQF5TIPSAYL-8AaD_MXuBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=unfortunate%20negro%20who%20now%20is%20so%20dazed%20&amp;%20parboiled,%20will%20be%20rescued%20&amp;%20returned%20to%20his%20friends%20and%20home,%20&amp;%20ever%20after%20live%20happily.&amp;f=false|title=Winslow Homer|first1=Nicolai|last1=Cikovsky|first2=Franklin|last2=Kelly|first3=Winslow|last3=Homer|first4=National Gallery of Art|last4=(U.S.)|first5=Museum of Fine Arts|last5=Boston|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Yale University Press|via=Google Books|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The painting alludes to [[John Singleton Copley]]'s 1778 composition, ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'', as well as a handful of dramatic marine paintings of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="C3"/&gt; In ''American Visions: The Epic History of Art in America'', [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] contrasts Homer's picture with Copley's. While Copley's shark jaw is alien in form and most likely drawn from second-hand accounts, Homer's— owing to the artist's familiarity with the subject— correctly captures the shark's anatomy. Secondly, in Copley's version, a rescue is imminent: the horizon is near and light in tone, and many boats, within the harbor and probably docked, are seen in the background. Homer's version, with its circling sharks, broken mast, lone figure, looming water spout, and open sea give a sense of abandonment. The ship at far left is so distant as to suggest that society, while present, is completely unattainable; it presents the viewer with a so-close-yet-so-far situation. These two paintings contrast in their immediacy as well.  In ''Watson and the Shark'' there is constant movement:  the boat moving forward, the downward thrust of the spear, the two men reaching down for the victim, and finally the shark which extends off the canvas.  In Homer's painting, the scene is more static:  the sharks seem to swim slowly around the boat which lolls in a trough between waves.

[[File:Delacroix barque of dante 1822 louvre 189cmx246cm 950px.jpg|thumb|left|The looming sharks of ''The Gulf Stream'' have been compared to the damned souls that besiege ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]].&lt;ref name="C5"&gt;Cikovsky, 370&lt;/ref&gt;]]

References to other 19th-century paintings, including ''[[The Barque of Dante]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]], ''[[The Slave Ship]]'' by [[J. M. W. Turner]], and ''[[The Voyage of Life]]'' by [[Thomas Cole]] have been noted as well.&lt;ref name="C3"/&gt; These three paintings (in the case of the Delacroix, a preliminary study) were in one of the finest public art collections in America in the mid 19th century, that of [[John Taylor Johnston]] of New York, and it is likely that Homer was familiar with the paintings; one of his own works, ''[[Prisoners from the Front]]'', was in the same collection.&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Cikovsky, 369-370&lt;/ref&gt; For art historian Nicolai Cikovsky, Jr., ''The Gulf Stream'' is more richly informed by these artistic predecessors than by Homer's direct experiences at sea, with the circling sharks derived from the tortured souls of ''The Barque of Dante'', the dramatic sea and sky inspired by ''The Slave Ship'', and the "mode of pictorial utterance" akin to ''The Voyage of Life''.&lt;ref name="C5"/&gt;

Elements in the painting have been interpreted as possessing funereal references: in addition to the black cross in the boat's bow, the open hatch (representing a tomb), ropes (for lowering the body), broken mast and torn sail (shroud) have been cited for symbolic meanings.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 383&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the boat in Homer's painting ''[[Breezing Up (A Fair Wind)]]'' of 1876 featured an anchor in its bow, symbolic of hope.&lt;ref name="C2"/&gt;
The sailor in ''The Gulf Stream'' ignores these allusions, as he pays no heed to the sharks, waterspout, nor the ship in the distance, and inverts the optimism of the romantic masterpiece ''[[Raft of the Medusa]]'' painted earlier in the century by [[Théodore Géricault]].&lt;ref name="C2"/&gt;

Homer biographer Albert Ten Eyck Gardner believed ''The Gulf Stream'' was the artist's greatest painting, and art critic [[Sadakichi Hartmann]] called it "one of the greatest pictures ever painted in America".&lt;ref name="G"/&gt; Later assessments have been more critical of the "almost excessive pathos of the drama."&lt;ref name="S"/&gt; [[John Updike]] thought the painting "famous but on the edge of the absurd, with its overkill of sharks and waterspout".&lt;ref&gt;Updike, John. ''Still Looking: Essays on American Art'', p. 67. Alfred A. Knopf, New York: 1997. {{ISBN|1-4000-4418-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Sidney Kaplan, a scholar on black American culture, ''The Gulf Stream'' is the "masterpiece of the black image— the deathless Negro waiting stoically, Homerically for his end between waterspout and white-bellied shark."&lt;ref name="S3"/&gt;  Peter H. Wood has written a book interpreting the painting as an allegory of the situation of blacks in America during the slave trade and afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Peter H. ''Weathering the Storm: Inside Winslow Homer's Gulf Stream (Mercer University Lamar Memorial Lectures)'', University of Georgia Press (July 7, 2004). {{ISBN|0820326259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is referenced in [[Derek Walcott]]'s ''[[Omeros]]'', where the poem's narrator encounters the work on a visit to an unnamed museum and identifies the man in the painting with his character, Achille, referring to the painter as 'another Homer'.&lt;ref&gt;Walcott, Derek. ''Omeros'', XXXVI, ii.&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting is also referenced in the film [[Good Will Hunting]] when the protagonist, Will Hunting (played by [[Matt Damon]]), identifies a painting in his therapist's office as a "Winslow Homer rip-off, except you got whitey rowing the boat there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSfxl1KI6y8|title=Good Will Hunting (3/12) Movie CLIP - The Painting (1997) HD|first=|last=Movieclips|date=28 September 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to the founding of the Pastel Society in London similar societies had been founded in [[New York City]] and [[Paris]], as well as a predecessor in London.
In 1882 The Society of Painters in Pastel was founded in New York by [[William Merritt Chase]], [[Robert Frederick Blum]], [[James Carroll Beckwith]], [[Hugh Bolton Jones]] and [[Edwin Blashfield]].
Influenced by The Society of Painters in Pastel, in 1885 the Société des Pastellistes was founded by artists in Paris.
The London Pastel Society held their first exhibition in 1888. The Society was organised by Sir John [[Coutts Lindsay]], owner of the [[Grosvenor Gallery]].
Prominent members of The London Pastel Society were [[William Rothenstein]] and [[Philip Wilson Steer]].&lt;ref name=AmericanPastels /&gt;

However all three predecessors were short lived. The Society of Painters in Pastel held its fourth and final exhibition in 1890.
The Société des Pastellistes disappeared after holding ten or more annual exhibitions.
The London Pastel Society did not survive beyond 1890 when its president Sir John Coutts Lindsay had to close the Grosvenor Gallery for financial reasons.&lt;ref name=AmericanPastels /&gt;

Early members and early exhibitors include [[Anna Airy]],&lt;ref name=BritishWomenArtists&gt;{{cite book

{{Wiktionary}}
'''''Vraisemblance''''' ([[French language|French]], "likelihood") is a principle developed in the [[Theatre|theatrical]] literature of [[Classicism]] in France.

It demands that the actions and events in a play should be believable. The principle was sometimes used to criticize [[soliloquy]] (speaking to the audience), and in late classical plays characters are almost invariably supplied with confidants (valets, friends, nurses) to whom they reveal their emotions.

In literature, vraisemblance refers to ways 'in which a text may be brought into contact with and defined in relation to another text which helps make it intelligible' (Culler, pp.&amp;nbsp;140).

Jonathan Culler suggests five different levels of vraisemblance in literature:
#A socially given text taken as the 'real world'
#A general cultural text in which a shared knowledge is recognizable
#Texts of genre conventions
#Self-referential texts that cite and expose genre conventions
#Intertextual texts where 'one work takes another as its basis or point of departure and must be assimilated in relation to it' (Culler, pp.&amp;nbsp;140)

The term is referenced in the [[Barenaked Ladies]] song "Crazy ABC's" from their album ''[[Snacktime!]]'' as a word beginning with 'v', as it begins with 'v'.

'''WikiToLearn''' is a collaborative, international, free knowledge project, run entirely by volunteers, and dedicated to the creation of [[Open textbooks|free]] and accessible textbooks for higher education. In December 2013 it joined the [[KDE]] Project through its incubation process with multiple sponsors like [[Wikimedia Italia]].

== History ==
WikiToLearn started as WikiFM in [[Milan]] by a group of science students from the [[University of Milan Bicocca]] on the May 1, 2012. WikiFM was originally launched as a private wiki for exchange of links, suggestions and other information related to studying at the University of Milan Bicocca.

In May 2013 the website has been publicly announced using some money destined to student associations of the University of Milan Bicocca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wikifm.org/2013/05/wikifm-cambia-faccia/ |title=WikiFM cambia faccia! &amp;#124; WikiFM blog |publisher=Blog.wikifm.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-12}} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this historical reason, while the project has an international aim, the bulk of the oldest content is in Italian.

In September 2013 WikiFM received the sponsorship of [[Wikimedia Italia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wikifm.org/2013/10/wikifm-patrocinio-wikimedia-italia/ |title=WikiFM patrocinato da Wikimedia Italia! &amp;#124; WikiFM blog |publisher=Blog.wikifm.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-12}} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, WikiFM officially joined the [[KDE]] project, by entering, as first project, [[KDE]]'s incubator program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/kde-community/2013q4/000375.html|title=[kde-community] Incubating project|work=kde.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://community.kde.org/Incubator/Projects/WikiFM&lt;/ref&gt; It was later advertised by the [[KDE]] project as one of its most important success stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dot.kde.org/2015/08/17/another-kde-success-story-incubator-part-1|title=Another KDE success story - the Incubator - Part 1|work=KDE.news|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From WikiFM to WikiToLearn  ==
2015 has been the turning point for the project. The key event happened during [[KDE]]’s annual conference, Akademy. In July 2015, Riccardo Iaconelli has given a speech on the WikiFM project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://conf.kde.org/en/akademy2015/public/events/272|title=akademy2015: Akademy 2015 Program|work=kde.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to submit it to the attention of the international community. On this occasion, the website has enriched to accommodate multiple languages, to embrace a larger number of people using their native language.
Following the initial feedback, WikiFM was subsequently renamed to WikiToLearn. The project thus started to gather a more official attention from educational institutions. The first foundation interested in using WikiToLearn as a training/tutoring platform has been the High Energy Physics Software Foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hepsoftwarefoundation.org|title=The HEP Software Foundation|work=hepsoftwarefoundation.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which experimentally tried its own section on the English website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikitolearn.org/Hep_Software_Foundation|title=Hep Software Foundation|work=wikitolearn.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikitolearn.org/Hep_Software_Foundation/Philosophy_of_this_site|title=Hep Software Foundation/Philosophy of this site - WikiToLearn - collaborative textbooks|work=wikitolearn.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several professors from different institutions have subsequently started to collaborate on WikiToLearn, like [[CERN]], HSF,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.hepsoftwarefoundation.org/workinggroups/2015/11/04/training.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fermilab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikitolearn.org/Contributing_to_WikiToLearn/Uni_list|title=Contributing to WikiToLearn/Uni list - WikiToLearn - collaborative textbooks|work=wikitolearn.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2015, the University of Milano-Bicocca became the first institution to officially back  the project, asking professors and students to populate the portal with educational content.

== The project ==
The goal of WikiToLearn is to provide free, collaborative and accessible textbooks for the whole world, with a focus on training and didactics. To reach this goal, the project relies on the combined effort of many volunteers in the academic world.

Content are written by both students, who ideally start to create textbooks while studying the subject in question, and professors, who provide thorough fact-checking and accuracy.

Given the deep technical nature of the topics, there is a complex review and rating system under review  to try to measure the quality of the individual articles.&lt;ref&gt;https://mail.kde.org/pipermail/wikitolearn/attachments/20150831/67d000be/attachment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2434">The '''Yamaha Music Foundation''' is an organization established in 1966 by the authority of the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japanese Ministry of Education]] for the purpose of promoting [[music education]] and music popularization. It continued a program of music classes begun by [[Yamaha Corporation]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Yamaha Music Foundation|url=http://www.yamaha-mf.or.jp/english/about/history.html|publisher=Yamaha Music Foundation|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its unique, systematic teaching method and [[Teacher education|teacher training]] programs are highly valued in [[Japan]] and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =Music School Opened In Lexington, MA (Yamaha) | newspaper =Music Trades| pages = | year = | date =June 1, 2006 | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-147218120.html| archiveurl = | archivedate = | accessdate =November 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Yamaha Grade Examination System'' has been developed to enable students and teachers to ensure their own progress and thereby obtain [[self-confidence]] in their own music studies.  The Yamaha Grade Examination System consists of nine grades, Grade 9 to Grade 1. The [[Test (assessment)|examination]] evaluates the performing ability of the music lovers in general; the performing ability and the musical knowledge and techniques required for the instructors of the fundamentals stage; and also the performing competence of the [[Music artist (occupation)|professional musicians]].

The foundation is known for its organizing of the [[World Popular Song Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Egluchi | first =Hideo | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title =Tokyo World Fest Draws 40 Songs; 6 Entered By Japan | newspaper =Billboard Magazine| pages =64 | year = | date =November 10, 1973 | url = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | accessdate =November 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which it organized from 1970 until 1989.
