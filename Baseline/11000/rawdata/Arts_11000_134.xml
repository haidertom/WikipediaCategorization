'''''A Negress''''' ({{lang-pl|[[Murzyn|Murzynka]]}}) is an 1884 realistic portrait study [[oil painting]] on canvas by the Polish artist [[Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz]]. During [[World War II]], the painting was stolen; it was recovered in 2012.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Negress|url=http://muzeumutracone.pl/en/portfolio/a-negress/|publisher=Lost Museum|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The picture was painted in oil technique in 1884 in [[Paris]]. It is a portrait of a black woman located on a light background. She is shown from waist up, dressed in a white robe, but is part naked, exposing a breast. She wears a gold necklace, and a red head scarf. This type of painting of an exotic person was a  popular topic in the late nineteenth century. The canvas is signed in the upper right corner with the painter's family name and date of creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negress Back in the National Museum|url=http://dzieje.pl/kultura-i-sztuka/odnaleziony-obraz-murzynka-wraca-do-muzeum-narodowego|publisher=Dzieje.pl|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The painting originally belonged to the collector Dominik Witke-Jeżewski, who deposited the canvas at the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum in Warsaw]] in 1933. In 1939, the painting was purchased by the Museum for 700 [[złoty]]s. During World War II, the painting was stolen in unknown circumstances, and since 1945 was sought by the Poles. In 2011, the painting appeared at an auction in Germany. It was recovered thanks to the effort of the [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Ministry of Culture and National Heritage]] and the support of the Kronenberg Foundation of Citi Handlowy Bank. Since 2012 the picture is once more displayed at the Warsaw National Museum.&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;

[[File:Alexander Mackenzie 001.jpg|thumb|Alexander Mackenzie, 1898]]
'''Sir Alexander Campbell Mackenzie''' [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]] (22 August 1847{{spaced ndash}}28 April 1935) was a Scottish composer, conductor and teacher best known for his [[oratorio]]s, violin and piano pieces, Scottish folk music and works for the stage.

Mackenzie was a member of a musical family and was sent for his musical education to Germany.  He had many successes as a composer, producing over 90 compositions, but from 1888 to 1924, he devoted a great part of his energies to running the [[Royal Academy of Music]].  Together with [[Hubert Parry]] and [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], he was regarded as one of the fathers of the British [[English Musical Renaissance|musical renaissance]] in the late nineteenth century.

==Life and career==
Mackenzie was born in [[Edinburgh]], the eldest son of Alexander Mackenzie and his wife, Jessie Watson ''née'' Campbell.&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U213304 "Mackenzie, Sir Alexander Campbell"], ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, 2007, accessed 28 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fourth musician of his family. His great-grandfather was an army bandsman; his grandfather, John Mackenzie, was a violinist in Edinburgh and [[Aberdeen]]; his father was also a violinist, the conductor of the orchestra in the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, and editor of ''The National Dance Music of Scotland''.&lt;ref name=mt&gt;"Alexander Campbell Mackenzie, August 22, 1847{{snd}}April 28, 1935", obituary, ''[[Musical Times|The Musical Times]]'', Vol. 76, No. 1108, June 1935, pp. 497–502.&lt;/ref&gt; Mackenzie's musical talent emerged early: at the age of eight he was playing nightly in his father's orchestra.&lt;ref name=mt/&gt; He was sent for his musical education to Germany, living with his teacher, the Stadtmusiker August Bartel, in [[Schwarzburg-Sondershausen]] in Thuringia, where he entered the [[conservatorium]] under K. W. Ulrich and Eduard Stein, remaining there from 1857 to 1861, when he entered the ducal orchestra as a violinist.&lt;ref name=mt/&gt;

[[File:Alexander-Mackenzie-age-12.jpg|thumb|left|Mackenzie, aged 12. In 1927 he said, "If I could only finish my career with a head of hair like that, I should die happy."&lt;ref name=mt/&gt;]]
Mackenzie wished to continue his violin studies with the teacher Prosper Sainton, who had taught his father, and in 1862 he successfully applied for admission to the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London, where Sainton taught.  His other tutors were the principal, [[Charles Lucas (musician)|Charles Lucas]] (harmony), and Frederick Bowen Jewson (piano).&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Barker, Duncan J. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/17356?q=Alexander+Mackenzie&amp;source=omo_t237&amp;source=omo_gmo&amp;source=omo_t114&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit "Mackenzie, Sir Alexander Campbell"], Grove Music Online (requires subscription), accessed 27 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after starting at the Academy, he was awarded a King's Scholarship, the income from which Mackenzie augmented by playing in theatre and [[music hall]] pit-bands, as well as in classical concerts under the leading conductor [[Michael Costa (conductor)|Michael Costa]].&lt;ref name=times&gt;''The Times'' obituary, 29 April 1935, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; This sometimes caused him to neglect his academic work, and on one occasion, having failed to prepare a piece by a classical composer for a piano examination, he improvised, "starting off in A minor and taking care to end in the same key", and convinced the examiners that it was a little-known work by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]. Recalling this prank in his old age, he added, "I have never ceased to wonder at my escape, and would certainly not advise any student to run a similar risk today."&lt;ref name=mt/&gt; Some of Mackenzie's early compositions were performed at the Academy.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

===Early career===
In 1865 Mackenzie returned to Edinburgh. He undertook a heavy workload of teaching, both privately and in local colleges, and from 1870 he was in charge of music at St George's, [[Charlotte Square]]. In 1873 he took on the conductorship of the Scottish Vocal Association. He also played the violin in orchestral concerts both locally and at the [[Birmingham Triennial Music Festival|Birmingham Festivals]] from 1864 to 1873, meeting visiting musicians including the conductor [[Hans von Bülow]], who became a firm friend.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; In 1874 Mackenzie married a local woman, Mary Malina Burnside (d. 1925). They had a daughter, Mary.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Carnegie, Moir, rev. Rosemary Firman.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34749  "Mackenzie, Sir Alexander Campbell (1847–1935)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 28 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Mackenzie successfully began composing orchestral music.  Bülow conducted his overture ''Cervantes'' in 1879,&lt;ref name=times/&gt; and two of his Scottish rhapsodies were premiered by [[August Manns]] in 1880 and 1881.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

[[File:Alexander mackenzie by spy.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Mackenzie by "[[Leslie Ward|Spy]]"]]
By this time, Mackenzie's heavy workload as a teacher and player began to undermine his health.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Two of Bülow's pupils in [[Florence]], Italy, Giuseppe Buonamici and George F. Hatton, introduced Mackenzie to the musical philanthropists Carl and Jessie Hillebrand. After a few months' rest in their care, Mackenzie began composing full-time.&lt;ref name=mt/&gt; Apart from a year in England (1885), he made Florence his home until 1888. During this period he spent much time in the company of [[Franz Liszt]]. He began composing large-scale works, including instrumental, orchestral and choral music and two operas.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; His [[cantata]]s ''The Bride'' and ''Jason'' were successfully given, and the [[Carl Rosa|Carl Rosa Company]] commissioned his first opera, ''Colomba'', written to a libretto prepared by [[Francis Hueffer]], music critic of ''[[The Times]]''. The opera premiered successfully in 1883.  A second opera, ''The Troubadour'', produced by the same company in 1886, was less successful, though Liszt thought well enough of the piece to begin work on a piano fantasia based on themes from it.  [[Pablo de Sarasate]] premiered a [[violin concerto]] by Mackenzie at the Birmingham Festival of 1885. For the 1885–86 season, Mackenzie was appointed conductor of [[Novello &amp; Co|Novello]]'s [[oratorio]] concerts in London. Liszt paid his final visit to England chiefly to hear his ''Saint Elisabeth'' performed under Mackenzie's direction in 1886.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Peak years===
In October 1887, the principal of the Royal Academy of Music, [[George Alexander Macfarren|Sir George Macfarren]], died, and in early 1888 Mackenzie was appointed to succeed him.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He held the post for 36 years until his retirement in 1924. At the time, the Academy was overshadowed by its younger rival, the [[Royal College of Music]], and Mackenzie set about reviving its reputation. He was fortunate in enjoying the friendly support of his opposite numbers at the College, [[George Grove]], and, from 1895, [[Hubert Parry]], and the two institutions established a close working relationship of mutual benefit. In addition to overhauling the curriculum and reorganising the faculty, Mackenzie engaged personally with his students by teaching composition and conducting the student orchestra. In 1912 the Academy moved from its old buildings in [[Mayfair]] to purpose-built premises in [[Marylebone]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; In his later years as principal, Mackenzie became markedly conservative, forbidding his students to play the chamber music of [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], which he stigmatised as "a pernicious influence".&lt;ref&gt;Rothwell, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackenzie was conductor of the [[Royal Choral Society]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Society|Philharmonic Society]] Orchestra between 1892 and 1899,&lt;ref name=mt/&gt; giving the British premières of many works, including symphonies by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] and [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; &lt;!--REFERENCE NEEDED FOR THIS RECENT ADDITION:  Also in 1899, Mackenzie was invited to be a founder honorary member of the [[Oxford &amp; Cambridge Musical Club]].--&gt;

[[File:Parry-Mackenzie-Stanford.jpg|thumb|left|Mackenzie (front c.), in 1910 with [[Hubert Parry|Parry]] (back l.), [[Charles Villiers Stanford|Stanford]] (front r.), [[Edward German]] (back r.) and [[Dan Godfrey]]]]
Like his father, Mackenzie took a great interest in folk music and produced several collections of arrangements of traditional Scottish songs.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1903, interested in investigating Canadian folk-song, he undertook a tour of Canada organised by the Anglo-Canadian musician [[Charles A.E. Harriss]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; His visit stimulated the cultural scene and choral festival competitions were held throughout Canada with eleven new choral societies being founded.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Mackenzie conducted concerts during the tour, exclusively of British music.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

Mackenzie was regarded as a cosmopolitan musician. He spoke fluent German and Italian and was elected to the post of President of the International Musical Society which he held from 1908 to 1912. From his early days playing in orchestras in Edinburgh and Birmingham he had met and become friendly with many leading international musicians, including [[Clara Schumann]], [[Joseph Joachim]], [[Charles Gounod]] and [[Antonín Dvořák]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; His friendship with Liszt began in Mackenzie's student days in Sondershausen and lasted for the rest of Liszt's life.

Although Mackenzie composed a large number of works, which met with great public success, he found, as had [[Arthur Sullivan]] earlier and as did Parry contemporaneously, that running a large musical conservatoire left less time for composition.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, David. "The South Kensington Music Schools and the Development of the British Conservatoire in the Late Nineteenth Century", ''Journal of the Royal Musical Association'', 130 no. 2, pp. 236–82; and Dibble, Jeremy. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35393, "Parry, Sir (Charles) Hubert Hastings, baronet (1848–1918)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 30 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Both at the Academy and elsewhere, he was a popular lecturer. Among his topics were [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', the text of his lecture on which was later published in translation in Italy.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Outliving his contemporaries Sullivan and Parry, he gave memorial lectures on their lives and works. At a time when Sullivan's reputation in academic musical circles was not high, Mackenzie's tribute was generous and enthusiastic.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, Alexander. "The Life-Work of Arthur Sullivan", ''Sammelbände der Internationalen Musikgesellschaft'', May 1902, Franz Steiner Verlag, pp. 539–64&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Mackenzie's professional prominence brought him many honours from universities and learned societies in Britain and abroad. He was [[knight]]ed in 1895, and created a [[Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] (KCVO) in 1922, the year of the centenary celebrations of the Royal Academy, in which he was the central figure. On his eighty-sixth birthday, over forty distinguished musicians presented him with a silver tray inscribed with facsimiles of their signatures, including [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], [[Frederick Delius|Delius]], [[Ethel Smyth]], [[Edward German]], [[Henry Wood]], and [[Landon Ronald]]. He retired from the Academy and from public life in 1924.&lt;ref name=mt/&gt;

Mackenzie died in London in 1935 at the age of 87.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

==Works==
{{Further|List of compositions by Alexander Mackenzie}}
''The [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' says of Mackenzie's music that it is "cosmopolitan in style and somewhat old-fashioned for its period, displaying influences of French and German composers, including [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]], [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; ''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' says that although Mackenzie's music was eclipsed by the works of later composers, "he and his contemporaries may be regarded as having laid the foundations of the [[English musical renaissance|musical renaissance]] in 19th- and early 20th-century Britain".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

During his time teaching in Edinburgh, Mackenzie wrote several works, including a piano trio, a string quartet and a piano quartet, and he maintained a considerable output despite his crowded schedule both then and later. ''The Times'' reported that his list of compositions numbered 90, of which 20 were distinctly Scottish.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

[[File:Sullivan to MacKenzie.png|right|thumb|Cartoon alluding to the irony of the failure of ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'' (1897) after Mackenzie had criticised [[Arthur Sullivan]] for "wasting his talents" on comic opera.]]
His orchestral works include the overture ''Cervantes'', performed at Schwarzburg-Sondershausen in 1877, three ''Scottish Rhapsodies'', a violin concerto premiered by [[Pablo de Sarasate]] at the Birmingham Festival of 1885,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times '', 28 August 1885, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; a "Scottish" concerto for piano (1897), a suite, ''London Day by Day'' (1902),&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 24 February 1902, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''Canadian Rhapsody'' (1905).&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 16 March 1905, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He composed [[incidental music]] to six dramas, including ''Ravenswood'', and [[J. M. Barrie]]'s ''The Little Minister''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 8 November 1897, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral march from his music for [[Henry Irving]]'s production of ''[[Coriolanus]]'' was played at Irving's funeral in 1905 and at Mackenzie's memorial service at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in 1935. He worked on a symphony but did not complete it.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

It was as a composer of vocal music that Mackenzie first achieved national fame. His cantata ''The Bride'' was a success at the [[Three Choirs Festival]] of 1881.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 10 September 1881, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Elgar]] played in the violins at the première and later remarked that meeting Mackenzie was "the event of my musical life".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; A second cantata, ''Jason'', for the [[Bristol]] festival of 1882, was also well received.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 20 October 1882, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous choral work was the oratorio ''The Rose of Sharon'', written for the [[Norwich]] festival of 1884.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 23 March 1885, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The words were adapted from the ''[[Song of Solomon]]'' by [[Joseph Bennett (critic)|Joseph Bennett]], music critic of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', who later provided Sullivan with the text for ''[[The Golden Legend (cantata)|The Golden Legend]]''. ''The Dream of Jubal'' (1889), is an unusual combination of recitation and choral sections, composed for the jubilee of the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra|Liverpool Philharmonic Society]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 14 December 1928, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackenzie's operas began in 1883 with ''Colomba'', first produced by the Carl Rosa Company. It was a success, but his second opera ''The Troubadour'' (1886) was not.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 9 June 1886, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Hueffer's libretti for both operas were written in an antiquated style that attracted much criticism. Mackenzie's other operas were a one-act opera, ''The Cricket on the Hearth'', first performed in 1914, ''The Eve of St John'' (1924), and two almost-complete operas, ''The Cornish Opera'' and ''Le luthier''.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

Critics observed that Mackenzie's operatic and choral music was generally ill-served by his librettists: "Much of his best work ... is neglected, partly because unlike his contemporaries, Parry and Stanford, Mackenzie went for the texts of his larger vocal works to such librettists as Joseph Bennett and Hueffer, instead of to the vital things of English poetry and literature."&lt;ref name=times/&gt; "[He] was content with librettos written by hacks according to the current operatic conventions."&lt;ref&gt;"Alexander Mackenzie: A Neglected Generation", ''The Times'', 15 August 1947, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  This even applied to his one excursion into [[comic opera]], ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'', a piece in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] vein, with a libretto by [[Francis Burnand|F. C. Burnand]] and [[R. C. Lehmann]] and additional lyrics by [[Adrian Ross]], presented at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_savoy/his_majesty/his_majesty_home.html ''His Majesty'' homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901175437/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_savoy/his_majesty/his_majesty_home.html |date=1 September 2006 }} at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 30 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Times]]'' commented, "Mr Burnand's experience as a librettist of comic opera, and Sir Alexander Mackenzie's inexperience in this class of composition might lead the public to expect a brilliant book weighed down by music of too serious and ambitious a type. The exact opposite is the case." Burnand's libretto was judged dull and confused, but Mackenzie's music was "marked by distinction as well as humour."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 22 February 1897, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackenzie also wrote books on [[Giuseppe Verdi]] (1913) and [[Franz Liszt]] (1920). In his memoirs ''A Musician's Narrative'' (1927), he described "a lifetime spent, boy and man, in the service of British music".&lt;ref&gt;''quoted'' in ''The Musical Times'' obituary&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''altarpiece of Pellegrino II''' is a [[medieval]] [[altarpiece]] in the [[cathedral]] of [[Cividale del Friuli|Cividale]], Italy. The [[silver]] [[relief]] was endowed by [[Pellegrino II of Aquileia|Pellegrino II]], the [[patriarch of Aquileia]], around 1200 and adorns today the main [[Altar (Catholicism)|altar]] of the church ''Santa Maria Assunta''.&lt;ref name="Stiftung von Pligrim II."/&gt; It shows [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and the [[Child Jesus]] surrounded by [[archangel]]s and groups of [[saint]]s.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, 1f."/&gt; The piece is notable for its rich ornamentation and its early [[typographic]] inscription.&lt;ref&gt;Brekle 2011; Visintini 2007; Pertoldi 1997; Koch 1994; Lipinsky 1986; Cuscito 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Cividale 0904 Duomo interior 1.jpg|thumb|View along the [[nave]] onto the illuminated altarpiece in the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]]]]

The altarpiece is located in the cathedral [[Santa Maria Assunta (Cividale)|Santa Maria Assunta]] in the town of Cividale in [[Friuli]]. The rectangular relief plate which measures about one meter high and two meters wide is made of partly [[gilded]] silver. Protected by a modern glass case, it towers above the principal altar in the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]]. It was consecrated by Pellegrino II who was [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (episcopal)|patriarch of Aquileia]] between 1195 and 1204.&lt;ref name="Stiftung von Pligrim II."&gt;Brekle 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;1f.; Lipinsky 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;75f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The altarpiece is divided into four parts: the center consists of a [[triptych]] which shows Mary as the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mother of God]] ([[Latin]] ''mater dei'') with the Child Jesus in her lap. From left and right the archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] rush to the seated mother and her child. The whole scene takes place under a three-arched [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]. The triptych is flanked by two departments which display, in three horizontal lines each, a total of 25 male and female saints standing next to one other. All figures except the Child Jesus are identifiable by name. A frame displaying a series of head medallions without inscriptions runs all around the triptych and the two lateral sections. In the upper horizontal frame piece Christ and [[John the Baptist]] as well as the [[four Evangelists]] are depicted. In its lower counterpart Pellegrino II, kneeling at the feet of Mary, can be identified by an accompanying inscription as the donator of the altarpiece. On the inside of the two frame boards a votive inscription composed of ten [[Leonine verse]]s runs horizontally across the altarpiece.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, 1f."&gt;Brekle 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;1f.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typography ==
All inscriptions of the altarpiece were written in Latin. The font of the dedicatory inscription is overall classified as Gothic capitalis.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, p. 2"&gt;Brekle 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt; Modern commentators agree that the inscriptions were produced by hammering individual [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] punches one by one into the silver plate.&lt;ref&gt;Brekle 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;19; Visintini 2007, fn.&amp;nbsp;82; Pertoldi 1997; Lipinsky 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;78&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this typographic method can be derived from the observation that the [[letterform]]s comply with the criterion of [[Type–token distinction#Typography|type identity]] according to which every letter imprint must come from one and the same letter punch.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, 19"&gt;Brekle 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;19&lt;/ref&gt; The type identity is ''inter alia'' evident in the repeated occurrence of the faulty letter "R" throughout the text that indicates a damaged letter punch.&lt;ref&gt;Brekle 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;17&lt;/ref&gt; The [[high relief]] letters stand proud in rectangular recesses created by the bases of the [[low relief]] punches; the fine edges between these recesses are a further indication of the sequential use of individual letter punches.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, 19"/&gt; A number of letters which are not properly aligned to their [[Baseline (typography)|baseline]] provide additional evidence that the artisan worked with separate punches.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, 19"/&gt;

A total of about forty [[Movable type|types]], which come in equal parts in a smaller and larger font size, were employed for creating the inscriptions.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, 4"&gt;Brekle 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; The smaller ones were used for the names of the saints and the donor's inscription of the patriarch, while the names of the archangels, of the Mother of God, the abbreviations of sanctus/sancta ("holy") and the two-line inscription were printed with the larger set.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, 4"/&gt; The latter text was punched into eight silver strips which were strung together and nailed onto the wooden substructure of the altarpiece.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, p. 2"/&gt;

According to the art historian Angelo Lipinsky, the altarpiece may have been inspired by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Reliquary|reliquaries]] which were decorated by the same typographic technique in the 10th to 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Lipinsky 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;78f.; Koch 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;213&lt;/ref&gt; However, a random check with the [[:de:Limburger Staurothek|Limburg Staurotheca]] which dates from this period showed that the inscription was [[engraved]] directly into the metal.&lt;ref&gt;Brekle 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;2f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Prüfening dedicatory inscription]] of 1119 is another early example of typographic text production in the Latin West.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2005, 22–25"&gt;Brekle 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;22–25&lt;/ref&gt; It differs in some technical details though: its plate is made of [[clay]], not silver, and the inscription was created in low relief with (wooden) stamps, not metal punches.&lt;ref name="Brekle 2011, 19"/&gt;

The '''Arca di San Domenico''' (Ark of Saint Dominic) is a monument containing the remains of [[Saint Dominic]]. It is located in Dominic’s Chapel in the [[Basilica of San Domenico]] in [[Bologna]], [[Italy]].

== History ==
The elaboration of this artistic masterpiece was performed in separate stages by the best sculptors of their time and took almost 500 years to finish.

Saint Dominic died in the convent of the  church of San Nicolò delle Vigne on 6 August 1221. He was buried behind the altar. The church of San Nicolò was expanded into the [[Basilica of San Domenico]] between 1228 and 1240. The remains of the saint were moved in 1233 from its place behind the altar into a simple marble sarcophagus, situated on the floor in the right aisle of the church for the faithful. Since most of the pilgrims, who came in great numbers to see the grave, were not able to see this shrine, hidden by so many people standing in front of it, the need was felt for a new shrine.

In 1264, the Dominicans then commissioned a new tomb for their founder to [[Nicola Pisano]], the famous sculptor of the [[pulpit]] of the [[Baptistry (Pisa)|Pisa Baptistery]]. He was certainly responsible for the design of the new sarcophagus, but in 1265 he was already at work on another assignment, the pulpit for the [[Duomo di Siena|Siena Cathedral]]. The front side was done in his workshop, partially by Nicola Pisano himself but mostly by his assistant Lapo di Ricevuto. The rectangular sarcophagus was originally borne on [[caryatid]] figures.  When the Ark was later redesigned, these supports were dispersed and are now tentatively identified in several museums: the archangels "Michael" and "Gabriel" (in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London), the statue "Faith" ([[Louvre]], Paris), a group of three deacons (in the [[Bargello]], Florence) and a similar group in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].

The sarcophagus was relocated in the middle of the church in 1411. Between 1469 and 1473 a crowning was added on the flat top of the sarcophagus by [[Niccolò dell'Arca]] and several other masters in their art. Among them was the young [[Michelangelo]], who added the statuettes of [[Saint Petronius|San Petronio]] (the patron saint of Bologna), a candlestic-holding angel and [[Proculus of Pozzuoli|San Procolo]] (closely recalling the statue of David, made ten years later).

In 1532, a step was added between the sarcophagus and the altar slab by [[Alfonso Lombardi]].

The Saint Dominic’s chapel was built by the Bolognese architect Floriano Ambrosini from 1597, replacing the small gothic chapel from 1413. The Dominicans wanted a chapel for their founder to match the splendour of the other existing chapels. The fresco on the cupola of the apse ''St. Dominic’s Glory'', a masterpiece by [[Guido Reni]], painted between 1613 and 1615, matches the artistic value of the underlying Ark of St. Dominic.

Finally the whole tomb was put on a marble altar in the 18th century. In a little chapel, on the back of the tomb, is the golden reliquary with the ''Head of St. Dominic'', a masterpiece by [[Jacopo Roseto da Bologna]] (1383).

[[Image:San Domenico25.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Front side of the sarcophagus.]]

== The sarcophagus ==
The [[sarcophagus]] is the middle part and also the oldest part of the shrine. It contains the remains of Saint Dominic in a cypress coffin, with the exception of his head (which is preserved in the [[reliquary]] at the back of the monument). [[Nicola Pisano]], already famous for his pulpit in the [[Baptistry (Pisa)|Pisa Baptistery]], was asked in 1264 to construct this sarcophagus. He was certainly responsible for the design, but left the brunt of the work to his workshop, since in 1265 he was already at work on a new commission (the pulpit for the Siena Cathedral.

The front side was done in his workshop, partially by Nicola Pisano himself but mostly by his assistant [[Lapo di Ricevuto]]. and another famous sculptor [[Arnolfo di Cambio]]. The Dominican brother fra [[Guglielmo da Pisa]] (who also designed in 1270 a pulpit in San Giovanni Fuorcivitas in [[Pistoia]]) made a small contribution. According to ''Gnudi'' (see ref.) an anonymous Fifth Master was also involved. A collaboration of several sculptors on such a large commission was normal practice in medieval sculpture.
[[Image:San Domenico20.jpg|thumb|right|225px|"St. Dominic resurrects the young Napoleone Orsini" (detail).]]

The sarcophagus recounts the life and miracles of Saint Dominic in a series of six carved panels. The compositions are neatly filled with figures in organized rows, giving a single approach to space. The sarcophagus is flanked on each corner by statues in high-relief of the Four [[Doctors of the Church]].

The scenes are arranged in following sequence from left to right and counterclockwise:

*On the left corner stands ''Paul the Apostle''.
*''St. Dominic resurrects the young Napoleone Orsini, after a fatal fall from his horse''. The expressive face of Saint Dominic, so different from the blander faces in this front panel, is attributed to Arnolfo di Cambio.
*In the middle: a high-relief of ''A Virgin and Child''.
*''The Miracle of the Book rejected by Fire'', acting out a story of Dominic’s preaching in [[Fanjeaux]], southern France, against the [[Cathar|Albigensian]] heresy.
* On the right corner ''St. Dominic with the Book and the Scourge''.
*''The Angels bring Bread to the Friars thanks to Dominic’s Intercession'', representing one of the first miracles of the saint.
* The back of the tomb gives two scenes (each with three episodes), divided by a statue of ''Christ the Redeemer''.
** On the left a scene of the life of Blessed [[Reginald of Orleans]], founder of the monastery in Bologna; ''the Blessed promises St Dominic to enter the Order''; ''the Blessed falls ill''; ''the Virgin heals him and gives him the habit of the Preaching Friars''
** On the right: ''St. Dominic asks [[pope Innocent III]] to approve the Order''; ''the pope dreams of the Saint supporting the basilica of the Lateran''; ''the pope approves the foundation of the Order.''
* In the corner on the right: a high-relief of ''St. Augustine'', author of the Dominican Rule.
*The last relief gives two more episodes: ''The Apostles Peter and Paul appear to Saint Dominic, while he was praying in the basilica of St. Peter,  and give him the staff and the Book'' (symbols of the Apostolic mission); ''the Saint sends his followers out on their mission to preach in the world.''

Work on the sarcophagus was finished in 1267. This sarcophagus, originally with its [[caryatid]] supports, was taken as model for other tombs: the shrine of [[St Peter Martyr]] in the basilica of [[San Eustorgio]] in [[Milan]], the shrine of St Luke (1316) in the basilica of San Giustina in [[Padua]] and the tomb of Beato Bertrando (c. 1334-1350) in [[Udine]].

== The crowning ==
[[Image:San Domenico14.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The elaborate spire.]]
The ambitious addition of a crowning to the sarcophagus was commissioned in 1469 to Niccolò da Bari to complete this funeral monument. Work at this elaborate spire continued till 1473.  But it is not clear why Niccolò did not complete his contract, even if he did continue intermittently at it until his death in 1494.

On top of a [[candelabrum]], rising from the [[Molding (decorative)#Types|cyma]], stands the impressive statue of the ''Eternal Father''. The candelabrum is held by two [[putti]], symbols of the sky, and four dolphins, symbols of the sea, all covered with [[festoon]]s with fruit, symbols of the earth.

On the cornice at its base is in the middle a small ''Pietà'', flanked by two winged angels (the ''Angel of the Annunciation'' and the ''Angel of the Passion''), while on the four corners stand the four [[Four Evangelists|Evangelist]]s in oriental robes. The lower part of the cyma is surrounded by several free-standing figures, the Patron Saints of Bologna: Saint [[Francis of Assisi]], [[St. Petronius (Michelangelo)|''St. Petronius'']] (began by Niccolò but finished by young [[Michelangelo]] in 1494), [[Saint Dominic]] and [[Saint Florian]]. On the back stand the statues St Anne, St John the Baptist (sculpted by [[Girolamo Cortellini]] in 1539), San Vitale and [[St. Proclus (Michelangelo)|''St. Proclus'']] (Michelangelo, 1494 – the resemblance and the posture of this statue shows that he likely had his ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' already in mind at that time). 
[[Image:San Domenico34.jpg|thumb|225px|right|''San Proculo'' (by Michelangelo).]]
Niccolò also added the delicate ''Candlestick-holding Angel'' on the left side of the altar slab, below the sarcophagus, while the [[Angel (Michelangelo)|''Angel'']] on the right side with its youthful strength is by Michelangelo. Michelangelo was paid thirty ducats by his patron Francesco Aldovrandi.

Because of the admiration he received for this splendid masterpiece, he was renamed [[Niccolò dell'Arca]]. Art critics perceive in this masterpiece a blend of influences: Burgundian, Florentine and non-Tuscan (such as details in clothing). The way these statuettes express their emotions and the patterns in their dresses and hair evoke the style of [[Jacopo della Quercia]]

== The step ==
The step, between the sarcophagus and the altar slab, was the third addition to the monument. It was sculpted in 1532 by [[Alfonso Lombardi]] (1497–1547). Again it depicts a number of episodes form the life of Saint Dominic.
* front: (left) ''St Dominic’s birth''; the ''young Dominic sleeping on the floor as a penance''; ''Saint Dominic shows his charity by selling his valuable hand-glossed parchments to help the poor'' (while he was studying in Palencia)
* front (middle part) ''The Adoration of the Magi'' (with the inscription: ''Alphonsus de Lombardis Ferraniensis F(ecit)'')
* front (right) ''The Saint is taken to Heaven on a ladder supported by Christ and the Virgin''.

== The altar ==
The marble altar was the last addition to the Arca. It was designed by [[Mauro Tesi]] (1730–1766) and later built by [[Alessandro Salviolini]] in 1768. On the altar slab stand the two statuettes of the angels holding a candlestick; on the left by Niccolò dell'Arca, on the right by Michelangelo.
[[Image:San Domenico27.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The reliquary.]]
{{Commons|Basilica of Saint Dominic#Ark of Saint Dominic (in St. Dominic's chapel)}}
The frontal was sculpted in G. Battista Boudard's workshop in Parma in 1768. It represents ''St. Dominic's Burial'', as designed by Carlo Bianconi (1732–1802).

== The reliquary ==
Behind the altar, under the sarcophagus is a small chapel, protected by a bronze grill, containing the precious reliquary with the head of Saint Dominic. This masterpiece of gold and silver is the work of the goldsmith [[Jacopo Roseto da Bologna]] (1383). Its octagonal base is adorned with elaborate enamelled panels, related to events in the life of the saint. The shaft consists of three levels. It stands in the middle of a circle with winged angels. The shaft supports an octagonal temple, containing the head. It is adorned with Gothic windows and small statuettes in niches. The silver bust of the Saint crowns the whole, but it was added in a later stage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28142">[[Image:Thap Mam Shiva 12th c.jpg|thumb|right|350px|This late 11th- or 12th-century sculpture illustrates both the preferred medium of the Cham artists (stone sculpture in high [[relief]]), and the most popular subject-matter, the god [[Shiva]] and themes associated with the god.  Shiva can be recognized by the third eye in the middle of his forehead and by the attribute of the trident.  The hands above his head are making the gesture called uttarabodhi [[mudra]], which is regarded as a symbol of perfection.]]

[[Champa]] was an Indic civilization that flourished along the coasts of what is now central and southern [[Vietnam]] for roughly a one thousand-year period between 500 and 1500 AD.  The original Chams were probably colonists from the [[Indonesia]]n islands, who adopted as their principal vocations those of trade, shipping, and piracy.  Their cities were ports of call on important trade routes linking India, China and the [[Indonesia]]n islands. The history of Champa was one of intermittent conflict and cooperation with the people of [[Java]], the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] of [[Angkor]] in [[Cambodia]] and the [[Đại Việt]] of what is now northern Vietnam. It was to the Đại Việt that Champa finally lost its independence.

The artistic legacy of Champa consists primarily of sandstone sculptures - both sculpture in the round and relief sculpture - and brick buildings.  Some metal statues and decorative items have also survived.  Much of the remaining art expresses religious themes, and though some pieces would have been purely decorative, others would have served important functions in the religious life of the Chams, which synthesized elements of Hinduism (especially [[Saivism]]), [[Buddhism]] and indigenous cults.

This artistic legacy has been decimated by neglect, war, and vandalism.  Much of the damage has been done in the 20th century. Some French scholars such as [[Henri Parmentier]] and [[Jean Boisselier]] were able to take photographs, create drawings, and pen descriptions of works which have been destroyed in the meantime.  Neglect continues to endanger the legacy of Champa to this day, especially the neglect of the inscribed stone [[stele]]s, the source of much valuable information on the history of Champa.  The participants in the [[Vietnam War]] wrought their share of devastation, wiping out for example the vestiges of the Buddhist monastery at Dong Duong ([[Quảng Nam]]).&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Willful vandalism and pilfering are an ongoing concern.

The largest collection of Cham art is on exhibit at the [[Museum of Cham Sculpture]] in [[Da Nang]].  Substantial collections are housed in the [[Guimet Museum]] in Paris, the [[Museum of Vietnamese History]] in [[Saigon]], and the Museum of History in [[Hanoi]].  Smaller collections may be found in the Museum of Fine Arts in Saigon and the Museum of Fine Arts in Hanoi.

== Forms of visual art ==

The remnants of classical Cham art extant today consist mainly in temples of brick, sandstone sculptures in the round, and sandstone sculptures in high and low relief.  A few bronze sculptures and decorative items made of metal remain as well.  There are no works of marble or other higher quality stone.  Likewise there are no paintings or sketches.  The people of Champa wrote, and perhaps also sketched, on leaves, which have not withstood the hot and humid climate of coastal Vietnam.  Items made of perishable materials, such as wood, for the most part have not survived.

=== Metal statues and jewelry ===

The remaining works of art made of metal include bronze statues of the [[Mahayana|Mahayanist]] deities [[Lokesvara]] and [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] dated approximately 900 AD and associated with the Buddhist art of Dong Duong.  An even older bronze statue of the [[Buddha]] bears a strong resemblance to Indian Buddhist statues of the Amaravati style; scholars doubt that it was originally from Champa, surmising instead that it must have come into the country as part of the maritime trade that linked India with Southeast Asia and China.&lt;ref&gt;Boisselier, "Un Bronze de Tara", p.319-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Shiva Kosa from Champa.jpg|right|thumb|This Cham ''kosa'', or metal sleeve to be fitted over a [[linga]], is the face of [[Shiva|Siva]], as can be recognized from the third eye in the center of the forehead and the chignon hairstyle known as ''jatamukuta''.]]
We have abundant textual evidence of much classical Cham art that once existed that has been lost to the ravages of time and the depredations of human vandals, looters, and conquerors.  For example, the early 14th-century Chinese historian [[Ma Duanlin]] reported the existence of a large statue of the Buddha made of gold and silver; the current whereabouts of this statue are unknown.  The Cham kings themselves have left us stone inscriptions describing the gifts of now lost precious objects they made to the shrines and sanctuaries of the realm.  Especially noteworthy was the practice of donating decorated metallic sleeves (''kosa'') and diadems (''mukuta'') to important [[linga]]s and the divinities with which they were affiliated.  For example, an inscription on a stone [[stele]] dated approximately 1080 and found at [[Mỹ Sơn]] reports that King Harivarman donated a "large, resplendent golden ''kosa'' adorned with the most beautiful jewels, more brilliant than the sun, illuminated day and night by the rays of shining gems, decorated by four faces" to the deity Srisanabhadresvara, a local embodiment of [[Shiva|Siva]].  A few years later, around 1088, Harivarman may have been outdone by his successor Indravarman, who donated a golden ''kosa'' with six faces (facing in the four cardinal directions, toward the Northeast and the Southeast) topped off by a ''nagaraja'' (serpent-king) ornament, and decorated with precious gemstones including a ruby, a sapphire, a topaz, and a pearl.&lt;ref&gt;Finot, "Notes d'Epigraphie: XI. Les inscriptions de My-Son."&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither of these treasures has survived.

The written sources, including the Chinese books of history and the Cham inscriptions, also report on some of the catastrophic events, primarily acts of war, that led to the loss of Cham art.  In the second quarter of the 5th century AD, according to the historian [[Ma Duanlin]], a Chinese general named Yuen Kan sacked the capital of Champa, making off with many "rare and precious objects", including "tens of thousands of pounds of gold in ingots coming from statues which he had smelted."  Similarly, at the beginning of the 7th century a marauding Chinese general named [[Liu Fang]] made off with "eighteen massive tablets of gold" commemorating the 18 previous kings of Champa.&lt;ref&gt;Hervey, ''Ma-Touan-Lin'', Volume 2, Chapter entitled "Lin-y."  The Chinese recognized a succession of Cham states: first Lin-yi (from the late 2nd century to the 8th century), then Huan-wang (from the 8th to the 10th century), and finally Chen-ching (from the 10th century onward).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is to be assumed that in the centuries that followed, frequent raids and conquests by [[Khmer people|Khmer]] and Vietnamese armies, which led to the eventual destruction of Champa as an independent political entity, likewise resulted in the removal of any portable works of art, including of course any works made of precious metals.

=== Temples of brick ===
[[Image:Po Klong Garai.jpg|right|350px|thumb|The profile of the 13th-century temple [[Po Klong Garai]] near Phan Rang includes all the buildings typical of a Cham temple. From left to right one can see the ''kalan'', the attached ''mandapa'', the saddle-shaped ''kosgrha'', and the ''gopura''.]]
Unlike the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] of [[Angkor]], who for the most part employed a grey [[sandstone]] to construct their religious buildings, the Cham built their temples from reddish [[brick]]s.  Some of these brick structures can be still be visited in the Vietnamese countryside.  The most important remaining sites include [[Mỹ Sơn]] near [[Da Nang]], [[Po Nagar]] near [[Nha Trang]], and [[Po Klong Garai]] near Phan Rang.

==== Buildings constituting a temple ====
Typically, a Cham temple complex consisted of several different kinds of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Tran Ky Phuong, ''Vestiges of Champa Civilization''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''kalan'' was the brick sanctuary, typically in the form of a tower, used to house the deity.
* The ''mandapa'' was an entry hallway contiguous with a sanctuary.
* The ''kosagrha'' or "fire-house" was the construction, typically with a saddle-shaped roof, used to house the valuables belonging to the deity or to cook for the deity.
* The ''gopura'' was a gate-tower leading into a walled temple complex.
These building types are typical for Hindu temples in general; the classification is valid not only for the architecture of Champa, but also for other architectural traditions of [[Greater India]].

==== Most significant temples ====
[[Image:PoNagar.jpg|right|thumb|The temple of [[Po Nagar]] is near [[Nha Trang]].]]
The culturally most important temples of historical Champa were the temple of Bhadresvara located at [[Mỹ Sơn]] near modern [[Da Nang]], and the [[Po Nagar|temple of the goddess]] known as [[Bhagavati]] (her Hindu name) or Yan Po Nagar (her Cham name) located just outside modern [[Nha Trang]].
* The temple of Bhadresvara was the principle religious foundations of northern Champa (known as ''Campadesa'', ''Campapura'' or ''nagara Campa'' in the inscriptions).  Scholars have identified the temple of Bhadresvara, a local incarnation of the universal deity [[Shiva|Siva]], with the edifice "A1" at Mỹ Sơn.  Though today A1 is in the process of devolving into a pile of rubble, it still existed as a magnificent tower when French scholars described it at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Tran Ky Phuong, ''Vestiges of Champa Civilization'', p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The temple of Yan Po Nagar was the principal religious foundation of southern Champa (or ''Panduranga'', a word that is the basis for the modern name "Phan Rang.")  Its buildings date from between the 8th and 13th centuries.  The temple remains standing to this day across the Cai River from Nha Trang, and is in relatively good condition.&lt;ref&gt;Tran Ky Phuong, ''Vestiges of Champa Civilization'', p.95 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sandstone sculptures ===
[[Image:Cham Naga.png|thumb|left|A decorative theme that originated in [[Java]], and from there emanated to other parts of [[Greater India]], is that of the [[makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] sea monster disgorging some other being.  In this 10th- or 11th-century Cham sculpture, the makara disgorges a [[Nāga|naga]].]]
The Cham created freestanding sandstone sculptures in the round, as well as high and [[bas-relief]] carvings of sandstone.  In general, they appear to have preferred sculpting in [[relief]], and they excelled especially at sculpture in high relief.  Cham sculpture went through a marked succession of historical styles, the foremost of which produced some of the best works of Southeast Asian art.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject-matter of Cham sculpture is drawn mostly from the legends and religion of Indian civilization.  Many of the sculptures are representations of particular Hindu and Buddhist deities, most prominently [[Shiva|Siva]], but also [[Lokesvara]], [[Visnu]], [[Brahma]], [[Devi]], and [[Shakti]].  Such sculptures may have served a religious purpose rather than being purely decorative.  Any sculpture in the round of an important deity that is completely forward-oriented, not engaged in any particular action, and equipped with symbolic paraphernalia, would have been a candidate for ritual or devotional use.  Cham sculptors also created numerous [[linga]]s, phallic posts linked symbolically with Siva (if the cross-section is a circle) or with the [[trimurti]] (if the post is segmented, consisting of a lower square section symbolic of Brahma, a middle octagonal section symbolic of Visnu, and a top circular section symbolic of Siva).  The ritual uses of the linga are familiar from modern Hinduism.

[[Image:Elephant on bas relief.jpg|right|thumb|This carving of an elephant is found on a pedestal belonging to the Mỹ Sơn A1 style.]]
A few of the sculptures in the art of Champa depart from the Indian subject-matter to reveal something of the life of the historical Cham people.  An example are the especially well-executed representations of elephants that serve as decorative details in some pieces: from written sources we know that the Cham relied on elephants for military and other purposes, since they lacked a steady supply of horses.  Other sculptures reflect the cultural legacy of [[Greater India]] and express legendary themes more typical of [[Javanese people|Javanese]] or [[Culture of Cambodia|Cambodian]] art than the art of India.  An example of such a theme is the motif of the [[makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] sea-monster, which came to Champa from Java, where it is prominent in the art of the [[Borobudur]] and other temples of the same period.

== Periods and styles of Cham art ==
Scholars agree that it is possible to analyze the art of Champa in terms of distinct "styles" typical for various historical periods and different locations.  Several have attempted through their study to set down a classification of historical styles.  Perhaps the most influential of these attempts are those of the French scholars Philippe Stern (''The Art of Champa (formerly Annam) and its Evolution'', 1942) and Jean Boisselier (''Statuary of Champa'', 1963).&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, ''The Art of Champa'', p.39 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Summarizing the conclusions of these scholars, art historian Jean-François Hubert has concluded that it is possible to distinguish at least the following styles and sub-styles:&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, ''The Art of Champa'', pp.33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mỹ Sơn E1 (7th to 8th century)
* Dong Duong (9th to 10th century)
* Mỹ Sơn A1 (10th century)
** Khuong My (first half of 10th century)
** Trà Kiệu (second half of 10th century)
** Chanh Lo (end of 10th century to mid-11th century)
* Thap Mam (11th to 14th century)
Each style is named after a place in Vietnam at which works exemplative of that style have been found.

=== Mỹ Sơn E1 Style ===
The ruins at [[Mỹ Sơn]] are not all of the same style and do not all belong to the same period of Cham history.  Scholars have coded the ruins to reflect the diversity of periods and styles.  The earliest identifiable style has been dubbed the Mỹ Sơn E1 Style. It is named after a particular structure, which scholars refer to as Mỹ Sơn E1.  Works of this style reflect foreign influence from a variety of sources, primarily from the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] of pre-[[Angkor]]ian [[Cambodia]], but also from the [[Dvaravati art|art of Dvaravati]], the [[Medang Kingdom#Culture and society|Javanese art]] of [[Indonesia]], and of southern India.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.33 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most famous work of the Mỹ Sơn E1 style is a large sandstone pedestal dated from the second half of the 7th century.  Originally, the pedestal had a religious function, and was used to support a huge [[lingam]] as a symbol for [[Shiva|Siva]], the primary deity in Cham religion.  The pedestal itself is decorated with [[relief]] carvings featuring scenes from the lives of ascetics: ascetics playing various musical instrument, an ascetic preaching to animals, an ascetic receiving a massage.  To the Cham, the pedestal symbolized Mount Kailasa, the mythological abode of Siva which also accommodated numerous forest- and cave-dwelling ascetics, just as the lingam it supported represented the god himself.&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Champa: Ancient Towers'', p.50ff.; Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important work of the Mỹ Sơn E1 style is the unfinished sandstone [[pediment]] that was once affixed over the main entrance to the temple at Mỹ Sơn E1.  The pediment shows the dawn of the present era according to [[Hindu mythology]]. [[Vishnu]] is reclining at the bottom of the ocean.  His bed is [[Sesha]] the serpent.  A lotus grows upwards from Vishnu's navel, and [[Brahma]] emerges from the lotus in order to recreate the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.72.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Dong Duong Style ===
In 875, the Cham king Indravarman II founded a new dynasty at Indrapura, in what is now the [[Quảng Nam]] region of central [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Champa: Ancient Towers'', p.72.&lt;/ref&gt;  Departing from the religious traditions of his predecessors, who were predominantly [[Shaivism|Shaivists]], he founded the [[Mahayana Buddhist]] monastery of Dong Duong, and dedicated the central temple to [[Lokesvara]].&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Champa: Ancient Towers'', p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple complex at Dong Duong having been devastated by bombing during the Vietnam War, our knowledge of its appearance is limited to the photographs and descriptions created by French scholars earlier in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.36 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  A fair number of sculptures of the period have survived, however, in the museums of Vietnam, and collectively they are known as the works of the Dong Duong Style.  The style lasted until well into the 10th century.

The Dong Duong style of sculpture has been described as a highly original style of "artistic extremism", "with exaggerated, almost excessively stylized features."&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.40.&lt;/ref&gt;  The figures are characterized by their thick noses and lips and by the fact that they do not smile.&lt;ref name="Hubert, p.43"&gt;Hubert, ''The Art of Champa'', p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent motifs include scenes from the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], Buddhist monks, [[dharmapalas]] (guardians of the Buddhist law), [[Architecture of Cambodia|dvarapalas]] (armed temple guardians), the [[bodhisattva]] [[Avalokiteshvara]], and the goddess of compassion [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], who was also regarded as the [[shakti]] or spouse of Avalokiteshvara.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.81 ff.; Huynh Thi Duoc, ''Cham Sculpture'', p.66 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Mỹ Sơn A1 Style ===
The art of the Mỹ Sơn A1 style belongs to the 10th and 11th centuries, a period of [[Hindu]] revival following the [[Buddhist]] period of Dong Duong, and also a period of renewed influence from [[Java]].  This period has been called the "golden age" of Cham Art.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;  The style is named after a temple at [[Mỹ Sơn]], "the most perfect expression of Cham architecture" according to art historian Emmanuel Guillon, that fell victim to the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s.  Most of the remaining monuments at Mỹ Sơn also belong to the Mỹ Sơn A1 style, including most of the constructions of groups B, C, and D.&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Mỹ Sơn Relics'', p.140-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

As to the sculpture of the Mỹ Sơn A1 style, it is known as being light and graceful, in contrast with the more severe style of Dong Duong.  According to Guillon, "It is an art of dance and movement, of grace, and of faces which sometimes wear a slight, almost ironic style, as though surprised by their own beauty."  Indeed, dancers were a favorite motif of the Mỹ Sơn A1 sculptors.  The style is also known for its fine relief images of real and mythical animals such as elephants, lions and garudas.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.128 ff.; Huynh Thi Duoc, ''Cham Sculpture'', pp.55 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mỹ Sơn A1 style encompasses not only works of art found at Mỹ Sơn, but also works found at Khuong My and Trà Kiệu, though the latter are sometimes treated as representing distinct styles. The works of Khuong My in particular are frequently treated as transitional between the styles of Dong Duong and Mỹ Sơn A1.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.45, 105 f.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, works found at Chanh Lo are sometimes treated as belonging to the Mỹ Sơn A1 style and sometimes treated as transitional between the Mỹ Sơn A1 and Thap Mam styles.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.134.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Khuong My Style ====
In the village of Khuong My in the Vietnamese province of [[Quảng Nam]] stands a group of three Cham towers dating from the 10th century. The style of the towers and the artwork associated with them is transitional between the powerful style of Dong Duong and the more charming and delicate Mỹ Sơn A1 style.  The style of Khuong My also exhibits Khmer and Javanese influence.&lt;ref&gt;Ngô Vǎn Doanh, ''Champa: Ancient Towers'', Ch.5: "Khuong My", p.95 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trà Kiệu Style ====
Although the Cham monuments at Trà Kiệu in [[Quảng Nam Province]] have been destroyed, a number of magnificent pieces of sculpture associated with the site remain and are preserved in museums.  Especially noteworthy are a large pedestal serving as a base for a lingam that is known simply as the "Trà Kiệu Pedestal" and another pedestal known as the "Dancers' Pedestal."&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.110 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trà Kiệu Pedestal, consisting of a base decorated with friezes in [[bas relief]], an ablutionary cistern, and a massive [[lingam]], is regarded as one of the masterpieces of Cham art.  The figures on the friezes are especially beautiful, and represent episodes from the life of [[Krishna]] as related in the [[Bhagavata Purana]].  At each corner of the pedestal, a leonine [[atlas (architecture)|atlas]] appears to support the weight of the structure above him.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.110-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dancers' Pedestal, likewise, is regarded as a masterpiece. The purpose and function of the pedestal, which has the shape of a corner piece, remain obscure.  Each side of the corner is graced by a dancing [[apsara]] and a music-playing [[gandharva]].

=== Thap Mam Style ===
After the 10th century, Cham art went into gradual decline.  Both architecture, as exemplified by the temples of [[Po Nagar]] and [[Po Klong Garai]], and sculpture became more stereotyped and less original.  Only the sculptures of mythical animals, such as the makara or the [[garuda]], could rival their counterparts of the earlier styles.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.54 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thap Mam Style of the 11th through the 14th centuries is named for an archaeological site in [[Bình Định Province]], formerly [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]].  The sculpture of this style is characterized by "a return to hieratic formalism and the simplification of shape, leading to a certain loss of vitality."&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.57.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sculptors seem to have been concerned more with the detail of ornamentation than with the grace and motion of the figures themselves.  Indeed, the style has been characterized as "baroque", in reference to the proliferation of ornamental details that distinguishes it from its more "classical" predecessors.&lt;ref name="Hubert, p.43" /&gt;

One of the most original motifs of the Thap Mam period was the sculpting in stone of a row of female breasts around the base of a pedestal.  The motif first emerged in the 10th century (the Trà Kiệu Pedestal at one point had such a row of breasts) and became characteristic of the Thap Mam Style.  It appears to have no counterpart in the art of other Southeast Asian countries.&lt;ref&gt;Guillon, ''Treasures from Champa'', p.147 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars have identified this theme with figure of Uroja ("breasts"), the mythical ancestor of an 11th-century dynasty at Mỹ Sơn, and claim a connection between this Uroja and the goddess venerated at [[Po Nagar]].&lt;ref&gt;Tran Ky Phuong, ''Vestiges of Champa Civilization'', p.146.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:edinburgh fringe festival.jpg|thumb|[[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe]], [[Scotland]], a notable arts festival]]
An '''arts festival''' is a [[festival]] that can encompass a wide range of art genres including music, dance, film, fine art, literature, poetry etc. and isn't solely focused on "visual arts." Arts festivals may feature a mixed program that include music, literature, comedy, children's entertainment, science, or street theatre, and are typically presented in venues over a period of time ranging from as short as a day or a weekend to a month.&lt;ref name="KorzaMagie1989"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pam Korza|author2=Dian Magie|title=The Arts Festival Work Kit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOrR9uPZ-IgC|year=1989|publisher=Arts Extension Service|isbn=978-0-945464-02-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each event within the program is usually separately ticketed.

Arts festivals are largely curated by an artistic director who handles the organizations' artistic direction and can encompass different genres, including [[fringe festivals|fringe theater festivals]] that are open access, making arts festivals distinctive from greenfield festivals, which typically are weekend camping festivals such as [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], and Visual Arts Festivals, which concentrate on the visual arts.

Another type of arts festivals are music festivals, which are outdoor musical events usually spanning a weekend, featuring a number of bands and musical genres including pop, rock, heavy-metal, and more. Since the 1960s, world-music festivals have become popular in a variety of countries. The most well-recognized music festival was [[Woodstock]], which took place in 1969 in Bethel, New York. It was attended by 400,000 people and featured performances by The Who, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and the Grateful Dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia with Atlas and Weather Guide|last=|first=|publisher=Helikon|year=2016|isbn=|edition=1|location=Abington UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=40 years after Woodstock, a more harmonious society|last=14 August 2009|first=|date=|work=USA TODAY|access-date=5 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Probably the two oldest arts festivals are located in England. The [[Three Choirs Festival]] in the West of England was established as a "yearly musical assembly" by 1719.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3choirs.org/about/three-choirs-history-festival-anthony-boden.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215092316/http://www.3choirs.org/about/three-choirs-history-festival-anthony-boden.html |date=15 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is the [[Norfolk and Norwich Festival]] which first took place in 1772.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norwich.gov.uk/internet_docs/docs/Unitary_Council/AnnexB.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621211721/http://www.norwich.gov.uk/internet_docs/docs/Unitary_Council/AnnexB.pdf |date=21 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest arts festival in England today is the [[Brighton Festival Fringe]].

Leading arts festivals include the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]] in [[Adelaide]], the [[Biennale of Sydney]], [[Festival d'Avignon]] in [[Avignon]], France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Robyn |last=Archer |authorlink=Robyn Archer |title=Putting Festivals in their Place |booktitle=Keynote address to the British Festivals Association conference |date=October 2006 |location=Cardiff }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TIMF|Tongyeong International Music Festival]] in [[Tongyeong]], Korea and Sanskruti Arts Festival, Upvan, India. One-off arts festivals have included the Liverpool08 [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2008.

In the summer of 1793, revolutionary France was invaded by foreign armies which resulted in the destruction of all signs of royalty. During this time, French citizens sang, danced, and theaters as well as indoor music multiplied. By 1793, two dozen new venues for music and drama had been established, as a result of the end of restrictive monopolies that previously ruled. Art dealings were rapidly increasing and as a flood of paintings were for sale, this reduced artists to near impoverishment. Therefore, as a result, this called for an attempt to replace the old system of the arts with a new one. This gave rise to festivals that were used not only as an artistic outlet, but also for political protest against the old government system. These festivals often included religious symbolism, political messages and embodied the spirit of liberty, equality and fraternity. In 1792, The "Festival of Liberty" included a Declaration of the rights of man, busts of Voltaire, Rousseau, and Franklin, a hymn to liberty, women in white carrying chains, and a large chariot with a seated statue of liberty &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45304719|title=The invention of art : a cultural history|last=1934-|first=Shiner, L.

==Types of arts festivals==
{{See also|:Category:Arts festivals by type}}

===Arts festival===
{{Main|:Category:Arts festivals}}
An Arts Festival is an umbrella-term for a festival that focuses on multiple art genres including fine art (painting, drawing, pottery), music, photography, film, and other visual styles &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.net/what-is-an-art-festival.htm|title=What Is an Art Festival? (with pictures)|work=wiseGEEK|access-date=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fringe festival]]s are a type of arts festival, often focusing on many arts but sometimes focusing on a specific art such as theater more than others.&lt;ref name="KorzaMagie1989"/&gt; Some subgenres of an arts festival include art fairs, theater festivals, dance festivals, film festivals, music festivals (pop festivals) and more. {{Main|:Category:Art festivals|:Category:Art fairs}}

===Art Fair===
An '''art fair''' is a subgenre of arts festival that focuses on [[visual art]] specifically, or specific fields of visual art such as [[List of new media art festivals|new media art festivals]]. Other subgenres of art festivals are termed [[:Category:Photography festivals|photography festivals]] or [[:Category:Street art festivals|street art festivals]], for example. Typically, an art fair has a wide range of artists, art dealers, collectors, and curators who buy or sell artwork in a venue, or gallery, that is open to the public. Some items for sale include photography, paintings, drawings, metalwork, handcrafted items and pottery.

Festivals of visual arts are also not to be confused with '''commercial art fairs'''. Artists participate in the most important of such festival exhibitions by invitation, and these exhibitions (e.g. the [[Venice Biennale]]) are organised by internationally recognized curators chosen by a committee of peers. Conversely art fairs are market-oriented shows where art dealers exhibit and sell the work of the artists they represent.

===Theater festival===
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}
{{Main|:Category:Dance festivals}}The first drama festival was in 543BC, at the Athenian Great Dionysia. At the drama festivals, playwrights and poets competed to have their plays performed, and the actors competed to win the title for best performance. The performances were given in semi-circular auditorium cut into hillsides and capable of seating 10,000–20,000 people. The stage consisted of a dancing floor, an orchestra, dressing room and scene-building area, known as a skene. The actors were typically men who wore masks appropriate to the characters they represented, and each might play several parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46471972|title=Chambers dictionary of world history|date=2000|publisher=Chambers|others=Lenman, Bruce., Anderson, Trevor.|isbn=0550130004|location=Edinburgh|oclc=46471972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film festival===
{{Main|:Category:Theatre festivals}}
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}
[[Film festival]]s are organized events, usually staged by universities, private organizations, local governments, or arts associations, that show films in cinemas or screening venues and provide filmmakers a chance to get notable recognition among fellow film enthusiasts. Films can include international and domestic releases and can even be on a specific film-maker, genre or subject matter. Film festivals are typically annual events and can feature full-length or short films.

One of the most notable Film Festivals is the [[Sundance Film Festival]], which originated from [[Salt Lake City]] in 1984 as part of the Sundance Institute organization and was founded by Robert Redford. To this date, it is one of the largest independent cinema festivals in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sundance Film Festival|last=Myers|first=Alice|publisher=Salem Press Encyclopedia|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetry festival===
Poetry festivals are organized events staged by poetry and literature groups, local arts associations, private organizations and others that showcase contemporary poetry and provide a chance for poets to meet each other, celebrate poetry, critique each other's work and debate poetic issues. Poets can include international, national and local writers, and can include a specific theme. They are often held in a particular location over set dates. In contrast to literary festivals, poetry festivals put poetry centre stage. Poetry Festivals are typically annual events. Festivals established for more than 10 years in the UK include the festivals at Aldeburgh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aldeburghpoetryfestival.org/|title=Aldeburgh Poetry Festival-You Will Enjoy Poetry In Its Entire Forms|author=|date=|website=Aldeburgh Poetry Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ledbury&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poetry-festival.co.uk/|title=Ledbury Poetry Festival 29th June to 8th July 2018|website=Ledbury Poetry Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Torbay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torbaypoetryfestival.co.uk/|title=Torbay Festival of Poetry|author=|date=|website=www.torbaypoetryfestival.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stanza Poetry festival in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stanzapoetry.org/festival|title=StAnza Festival 2018|website=StAnza, Scotland's Poetry Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, a number of popular poetry festivals and in Northeast India, Guwahati Grand Poetry festival and Assam Arts Biennale, which began in 2018, are the first of its kind in the region.

The '''''Arzhang''''' (''Aržang'', a [[Parthian language|Parthian]] word meaning "Worthy"; also known as '''''Book of Pictures''''') was one of the holy books of [[Manichaeism]]. It was written and illustrated by its prophet, [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]], in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. It was unique as a sacred text in that it contained numerous pictures designed to portray the events in the Manichaean description of the creation and history of the world, which were regarded as integral to the text.  In Islamic tradition Mani was regarded as an artist by profession.

The book has been lost and its content is unknown. However, it is known that its illustrations were of appreciable quality, and copies were preserved in the Middle East as late as 1092 AD, when it is recorded that the library of [[Ghazni]] held a copy.

In addition, ''[[Arzhang Div|Arzhang]]'' is the name of the [[daeva]] (demon) in [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[Shahnameh]] who takes [[Kay Kāvus]] to [[Mazanderan]], and whom [[Rostam]] defeats in his sixth trial.

[[File:Basil-hood-1917.tif|right|thumb|250px|Basil Hood]]
'''Basil Willett Charles Hood''' (5 April 1864 &amp;ndash; 7 August 1917) was a British dramatist and lyricist, perhaps best known for writing the libretti of half a dozen [[Savoy Opera]]s and for his English adaptations of [[operetta]]s, including ''[[The Merry Widow]]''.

He embarked on a career in the [[British Army]], rising to the rank of captain, while writing theatrical pieces in his spare time. After some modest success, Hood and his collaborator, the composer [[Walter Slaughter]], had a major hit with their long-running show, ''[[Gentleman Joe]]'', in 1895. Another long-running success was ''[[The French Maid]]'' (1896). Hood then resigned from the army to pursue his career as a librettist full-time. With [[Arthur Sullivan]] and then [[Edward German]], he wrote several well-received pieces for the [[Savoy Theatre]], including ''[[The Rose of Persia]]'' (1899), ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'' (1901), ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' (1902) and ''[[A Princess of Kensington]]'' (1903).

After [[comic opera]] went out of fashion, Hood turned to [[Edwardian musical comedy]], writing lyrics for ''[[The Belle of Mayfair]]'' (1906) and ''[[The Girls of Gottenberg]]'' (1907), among others. He then found his greatest success with adaptations of continental operettas for the impresario [[George Edwardes]], writing English versions of such works as (1907), ''[[The Dollar Princess]]'' (1908), ''[[A Waltz Dream]]'' (1908) and ''[[The Count of Luxembourg]]'' (1911), among others, sometimes drastically rewriting the book and lyrics. At the outbreak of [[World War I]], he took up a demanding post in the British [[War Office]], which is believed to have contributed to his early death.

==Life and works==

===Early life and military career===
Hood was born in [[Croydon]], Surrey, the youngest of nine children of the psychiatrist Sir William Charles Hood (1824–1870), [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], who was superintendent, physician and treasurer to [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] and later a [[Commissioners in Lunacy|Commissioner in Lunacy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily News'', 13 July 1868, p. 5; and "The Dundee Courier", 18 July 1868, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Jane ''née'' Willett (1826–1866).&lt;ref name=JDSmith&gt;Smith, J. Donald. "Who Was Basil Hood? – Part I", ''Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Magazine'', No. 84, Spring 2014, pp. 26–35&lt;/ref&gt; After both parents died in his early childhood, Hood was raised by his older siblings&lt;ref name=JDSmith/&gt; and educated at [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington]] and [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]]. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the [[Green Howards]] in 1883.&lt;ref name=mg&gt;"Obituary, Captain Basil Hood", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 8 August 1917, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887, he married Frances Ada ''née'' English (1866–1922), but two months later she was institutionalised at Bethlem Royal Hospital, and she remained in asylums until her death.&lt;ref name=JDSmith/&gt; He was promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] in 1893 and retired in 1895, but joined the 3rd ([[Militia]]) Battalion later the same year. He resigned his commission in 1898.&lt;ref name=mg/&gt; A courteous gentleman, Hood was well-liked; he was also generous with money and a poor businessman.&lt;ref name=Smith2&gt;Smith, J. Donald. "Who Was Basil Hood? – Part II", ''Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Magazine'', No. 85, Summer 2014, pp. 15–32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early stage works===
Hood began writing for the theatre in his mid-twenties. His first one-act piece, ''The Gypsies'', with music by Wilfred Bendall (1850–1920), was mounted as a curtain-raiser at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]] in 1890. ''[[The Times]]'' praised the piece and remarked on "a certain flavour of Gilbertian paradox".&lt;ref&gt;"Prince of Wales's Theatre," ''The Times'', 27 October 1890, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Hood provided the lyrics to [[Lionel Monckton]]'s song, "What Will You Have to Drink?", interpolated into the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' in 1892.&lt;ref name=BMT&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/british/authors/hood.html Basil Hood biography] at the British Musical Theatre website of the Gilbert and Sullivan archive, 31 August 2004, adapted from ''The Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre'' by [[Kurt Gänzl]], accessed 11 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Hood then wrote two short [[operetta]]s with music by [[Walter Slaughter]]. The first was ''Donna Luiza'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]], 27 March 1892, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; which ''The Times'' again compared to [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s work, this time less favourably.&lt;ref&gt;"Prince of Wales's Theatre", ''The Times'', 24 March 1892, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The second piece by Hood and Slaughter was ''The Crossing Sweeper'', presented at the Gaiety Theatre, with [[Kate Cutler]] and Florence Lloyd.&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 16 April 1893, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frenchmaid1.jpg|thumb|right|Theatre poster from 1897]]
In 1895, Hood and Slaughter wrote a full-length [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]], ''[[Gentleman Joe]], the Hansom Cabbie'', a vehicle for the comedian [[Arthur Roberts (comedian)|Arthur Roberts]]. It ran for 391 performances in London, with a second company also presenting it in the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 25 August 1895, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Its success prompted Hood to resign his army commission to concentrate on his writing,&lt;ref name=larkin&gt;Larkin, Colin (ed).

===Librettist of Savoy Operas===
After [[Arthur Sullivan]] finished collaborating with W. S. Gilbert (''[[The Grand Duke]]'', in 1896, was their last joint work), [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], the proprietor of the [[Savoy Theatre]], looked for other librettists to provide librettos for Sullivan to set. Hood was introduced to Sullivan by his old collaborator Wilfred Bendall, who was then Sullivan's secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Fredric Woodbridge. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/46772?q=Basil+Hood&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit  "Hood, Basil"], Grove Music Online, accessed 13 June 2010 (requires subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's several operas written in the 1890s without Gilbert had not been successful,&lt;ref&gt;''The Chieftain'', with [[F. C. Burnand]] ran for 97 performances in 1894–95, and ''The Beauty Stone'' with [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] and [[J. Comyns Carr]] ran for 50 performances in 1898: see Rollins and Witts, pp. 15–18&lt;/ref&gt; but his new opera with Hood, ''[[The Rose of Persia]]'' (1899), ran for 213 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Hood also wrote the libretti for two short companion pieces at the Savoy. The first was ''[[Pretty Polly (opera)|Pretty Polly]]'', which ran with ''The Rose of Persia'' in 1900 and with ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' in 1900–01,&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/companions/pretty_polly/reviews.html ''Pretty Polly'': Reviews reproduced from ''The Pall Mall Gazette'' etc.] at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 8 May 2008, accessed 11 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the second was ''[[Ib and Little Christina]]'' (1900), which played in several theatres including the Savoy (in 1901, as a companion piece to Hood's ''[[The Willow Pattern]]'').&lt;ref name=rw19&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Hood also wrote such plays, during this period, as ''The Great Silence'', with [[Louie Pounds]] (Coronet Theatre, London; 1900),&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 606&lt;/ref&gt; which was presented together with ''[[Cox and Box]]'' (starring [[Courtice Pounds]] as Box) and ''Ib and Little Christina'', with Louie Pounds as adult Christina (otherwise, the original cast reprised their roles).&lt;ref&gt;"The Coronet Theatre", ''The Morning Post'', 25 July 1900, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RoseofPHas.jpg|left|thumb|Illustration of scene from ''[[The Rose of Persia]]'', 1899]]
After the success for Hood and Sullivan of ''The Rose of Persia'', the pair were soon writing a second opera, ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'' (1901). Sullivan died while writing this new work, however, and the task of completing it fell to [[Edward German]]. The production was another reasonable success, with 205 performances.&lt;ref name=rw19/&gt; Hood wrote that, at the time of Sullivan's death, he and Sullivan had also begun work on a serious opera.&lt;ref name=Smith2/&gt; Hood and German went on to collaborate on the successful ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' (1902), which played at the Savoy for 120 performances, toured the provinces for 14 weeks, and then returned for another run at the Savoy.&lt;ref name=rw20&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Of ''Merrie England'', ''The Observer'' wrote, "It is not too much to say that Capt. Basil Hood and Mr. Edward German have, by means of the latest Savoy success, increased their reputations to an extent that will lead the musical public to look to them in future for work as epoch-making in its peculiar ''genre'' as that of Gilbert and Sullivan. Capt. Hood is the only writer of "words for music" whose lyrics can compare with those of Mr. Gilbert for finish, rhythmic piquancy, and verbal quaintness."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 6 April 1902, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Another piece in 1902, ''My Pretty Maid'', starring [[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]], lasted less than two months.&lt;ref name=Smith2/&gt; When ''Merrie England'' finished its second London run, German and Hood immediately followed it with ''[[A Princess of Kensington]]'' (1903) which ran for 115 performances and then went on tour. After that, their producer, [[William Greet]], turned away from light opera, which effectively ended their work together.&lt;ref name=BMT/&gt;

===Adapter of operettas===
[[Image:A Waltz Dream.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gertie Millar]] and [[Robert Evett]] in Hood's version of ''[[A Waltz Dream]]'']]
Between 1903 and 1906, Hood worked on several musical comedies, including one based on ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', but when producer [[Charles Frohman]] started altering his work to suit casting considerations, he withdrew his name from the book of what was produced with great success as ''[[The Belle of Mayfair]]'' (1906), although he remained credited with some lyrics. He also revived ''Little Hans Andersen'' at the [[Adelphi Theatre]], in 1903, and adapted [[Victorien Sardou]]'s play ''Les Merveilleuses'' as the libretto for [[George Edwardes]]'s musical at [[Daly's Theatre]], ''[[The Merveilleuses]]'' (1906). Next, he supplied the Gaiety Theatre with lyrics for the successful musical ''[[The Girls of Gottenberg]]'' (1907).&lt;ref name=Smith2/&gt;&lt;ref name=BMT/&gt;

With the resurgence of interest in Continental European [[operetta]]s, Edwardes engaged Hood to prepare the English versions of what became a series of extremely successful productions. Critical opinion has differed about this period of Hood's career. ''The Times'', in its obituary notice, wrote, "He spent more ability in adapting librettos for the late George Edwardes than the quality of the work demanded … under these conditions he scarcely fulfilled his promise as a wit and poet.&lt;ref name=times&gt;Obituary, ''The Times'', 8 August 1917, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in the view of the ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music'', "adapting German and Viennese operettas … is where he found his métier. Often discarding the original premise, he helped create lively and very popular operettas."&lt;ref name=larkin/&gt; Hood generally changed the structure of these works from three acts to two, often greatly re-writing them and adapting the plots.&lt;ref name=Smith2/&gt; Shows that Hood adapted included the tremendously popular London production of ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' (1907); another hit, ''[[The Dollar Princess]]'' (1908); ''[[A Waltz Dream]]'' (1908); another success, ''[[The Count of Luxembourg]]'' (1911), and the also popular ''Gypsy Love'' (1912).

Hood's original works were few in these years. In 1909, his ''Little Hans Andersen'' was revived under the management of [[William Greet]]. In 1913 he wrote his last musical comedy success, ''The Pearl Girl'', with [[Howard Talbot]].&lt;ref name=Smith2/&gt;&lt;ref name=BMT/&gt; In 1912, the actor-manager [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree|Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] proposed another collaboration between Hood and German to provide a musical production based on the life of [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]], but German declined the commission.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Tim. [http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?catNum=223419&amp;filetype=About+this+Recording&amp;language=English "Edward German (1862 –1936)"], Naxos, 1992, accessed 11 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last years===
With the outbreak of [[World War I]], German-language operetta lost its popularity. After that, Hood supplied lyrics for individual numbers for some musicals, and a [[revue]], ''Bric-a-Brac'' with [[Lionel Monckton]] and [[Arthur Wimperis]], and some non-musical plays. In the early days of the war, he took up a post with the Cryptography Division of the [[War Office]].&lt;ref name=Smith2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John]]. [http://www.musicals101.com/who22.htm "Who's Who in Musicals: Additional Bios XII"], Musicals101.com, 2004, accessed 11 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the heavy demands of his wartime work, he wrote a patriotic light opera, ''Young England'', with music by [[George Clutsam|G. H. Clutsam]] and [[Hubert Bath]], starring [[Walter Passmore]], which ran at [[Daly's Theatre]] and then the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 1916–17 before going on tour.&lt;ref&gt;"''Young England'': Music and Laughter at Daly's", ''The Times'', 26 December 1916, p. 9; ''The Times'' 4 January 1917, p. 8; and 26 March 1917, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In his final years, Hood developed an obsession with Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'', which he believed contained a [[cryptogram]] that he worked to decipher. His companion of later years was Doris Armine Ashworth; she died about 1958.&lt;ref name=Smith2/&gt;

Hood died suddenly in his flat in [[St. James's Street]], London, at the age of 53, from the effects of overwork and neglecting to eat.&lt;ref&gt;"Captain Basil Hood's Death: Excessive Concentration on Cryptograms", ''The Times'', 11 August 1917; p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, his  children's book,  ''Saint George of England'', was published in 1919 by George G. Harrap &amp; Co., London.&lt;ref name=Smith2/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12518">'''Billionaires for Bush''' was a [[culture jamming]] political [[street theater]] organization that satirically purported to support [[George W. Bush]], drawing attention to policies which were perceived to benefit [[corporation]]s and the super-wealthy. The group would typically dress as parodies of wealthy "establishment" figures in tuxedos while proclaiming slogans such as "Two Million Jobs Lost—It's a Start".

A secret [[New York City Police Department]] intelligence report, based on undercover surveillance of the group in 2003 and 2004 in advance of the [[2004 Republican National Convention]] in [[New York City]], described the Billionaires as "an activist group forged as a mockery of the current president and political policies".&lt;ref name=Satire/&gt;

==History==
===Forbes 1999===
The organization had first been founded by Andrew Boyd as "Billionaires for Forbes", but Forbes left the 2000 race for the Republican Presidential nomination early due to a lack of adequate voter support. In 1999, Billionaires were present as [[Steve Forbes]] announced his candidacy for President and jeered him as he signed a [[flat tax]] pledge in [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Zuckman, Jill. [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADDD973B3F2A6A&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "FORBES SIGNS N.H. ANTITAX PLEDGE FLAT-TAX PROPOSAL PROTESTED AS ELITIST BY BOSTON GROUP"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', March 17, 1999. Accessed August 18, 2008. "But as he stood with his back to the state capitol and promoted his proposal to eliminate the current federal tax code and institute a 17 percent flat tax, protesters from Boston began chanting ''billionaires for Forbes'' ..."&lt;/ref&gt; The Billionaire Manual describes the action:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They wore conservative jackets and ties (but no bowler hats, etc.) and carried innocuous signs such as "Run, Steve, Run." Happy to have grass-roots support, the Forbes handlers (who believed the Billionaires were students from a nearby business school) placed them in front of the cameras, very near to the podium from which Forbes was speaking. However, each of their signs had another sign behind it. And behind their banner (which read "Forbes 2000: He wants YOU to win") was another banner, waiting. At the most dramatic moment of his announcement, the Billionaires flipped their signs, and pulled away the large banner to reveal one which read: "Billionaires for Forbes: Because Inequality isn't Growing Fast Enough." The Billionaires started chanting "Let workers pay the tax so investors can relax!" and other slogans. Forbes and his handlers were completely thrown off, a little tussle ensued, and the Billionaires were pushed off to the side away from the cameras. Not wanting to miss the action, half the TV crews left the Forbes speech to cover the Billionaires. The action got lots of coverage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bush (or Gore) 2000===
During the [[2000 U.S. presidential election]] the organization was led by Andrew Boyd and Jenny Levison as "Billionaires for Bush (or Gore)," with the message that whichever candidate became president, corporations and the wealthy were guaranteed to benefit. The group spoke out under the motto "Because Economic Inequality Is Not Growing Fast Enough".&lt;ref&gt;DiFilippo, Dana. [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DN&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI|DN&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB7312136BDD38B&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "FUNNY WAY TO RUN A PROTEST"], ''[[The Philadelphia Daily News]]'', July 29, 2000. Accessed August 18, 2008. "THE WAY MILLIE O'Nair sees it, it doesn't matter whether George W. Bush or Al Gore wins the presidency. ... ''Whoever wins, we win!'' said O'Nair, who co-chairs Billionaires for Bush (or Gore).&lt;/ref&gt;

The group appeared at the [[2000 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], satirically praising major corporations for their financial support of the convention by attempting to deliver thank you cards to [[FleetBoston Financial|Fleet Bank]], [[Fidelity Investments]] and [[Verizon Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/10/03/debate.protests.01/index.html "Nader tossed off grounds at debate site"], ''[[CNN]]'', October 3, 2000. Accessed August 18, 2008. "Others—dressed in fake pearls and top hats—dubbed themselves ''Billionaires for Bush or Gore'', and satirically praised the corporations helping underwrite the debate.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Billionaires planned a "Million Billionaires March" at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]] in [[Philadelphia]] held the day before the convention. Other activities included a "Vigil for [[corporate welfare]]" and an auction of corporate advertising rights for the [[Liberty Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Gwen. [http://www.citypaper.net/articles/072700/con.counter.side.shtml "C'mon Buy!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621152630/http://www.citypaper.net/articles/072700/con.counter.side.shtml |date=2007-06-21 }}, ''[[Philadelphia City Paper]]'', July 27, 2000. Accessed August 18, 2008. "The Billionaires may be a hoax, but the events they’ve planned are very real, starting with a Million Billionaire March the day before the convention."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bush 2004===
At a March 2004 fundraiser on [[Long Island]] attended by President Bush, Billionaires for Bush came to show their "support", with men dressed in tuxedos with top hats and women in evening gowns and long gloves. The groups laminated posters featured such slogans as "Leave No Billionaire Behind" and "Corporations Are People Too."&lt;ref&gt;Hitt, Jack. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/28/magazine/28ENCOUNTER.html?position=&amp;ei=5007&amp;en=2a84e4f3a12ac7a0&amp;ex=1395810000&amp;partner=USERLAND&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position= "The Birth of the Meta-Protest Rally?"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 28, 2004. Accessed August 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their largest events to date took place as part of the [[2004 Republican National Convention protest activity]]. A separate group, however, continued on in the plague-on-both-your-houses style as "Billionaires For Bush Or Kerry".

A "Million Billionaires March" on July 27, 2004, in conjunction with the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], attracted 150 marchers who presented a faux check made out for the amount of "whatever it takes" to the local offices of the Republican Party, as part of an effort to "defeat" Kerry.&lt;ref&gt;Vozick-Levinson, Simon. [http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=503234 "'Wealthy' Protesters Make Case Outside DNC"], ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', July 30, 2004. Accessed August 18, 2008. "We therefore call upon all loyal People of Wealth to defy the Democratic National Convention and converge on the streets of Boston for a Million Billionaire March on July 27. And converge they did—150 of them, according to those who attended—to take back the streets for the silver-spoon set and present a symbolic check in the amount of “whatever it takes” to the local GOP headquarters."&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawsuits filed against the [[New York City Police Department]] after the 2004 Republican Convention uncovered the fact that Billionaires for Bush had been among groups infiltrated by the NYPD by its undercover officers gathering intelligence in advance of the convention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/opinion/19tue4.html?ref=opinion "Editorial: The Convention Papers"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 18, 2008. Accessed August 19, 2008."The department later said that its actions were based on intelligence gathered by a special unit of undercover officers who had infiltrated dozens of protest groups, including innocuous ad hoc outfits like the comical Billionaires for Bush."&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 and beyond===
The group remained active after 2004, but was less prominent. It used its established [[meme]] to raise awareness to a myriad of economic issues including [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] privatization, the [[Iraq War]], the [[Estate Tax]] and [[gentrification]].

The group was led by a triumvirate of co-chairs Elissa Jiji, [[Marco Ceglie]], and Melody Bates.

==Attire==
Members typically dressed in stereotypically wealthy attire, such as [[tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedos]] and [[top hat]]s or [[evening gown]]s and [[pearl]]s and adopt names like "Mo Bludfer Oyle" (more blood for oil, a reference to the Iraq war) and "Phil T. Rich" (filthy rich).

Members also dressed in less stereotypical attire to perform more subtle pranks, as described in the Forbes example, above.

==Events==
Examples of Billionaire events include:
* Musical entertainment at anti-Bush events
* Thanking [[George W. Bush]] on his birthday for their tax cuts
* Protesting protests of the Bush administration
* Taking a pro-war stance at peace rallies
* Cross-country [[limousine]] tours &lt;ref&gt;[http://billionairesforbush.com/limotour_info.php]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A petition to allow oil drilling and logging of [[Golden Gate Park]] in San Francisco
* Bush League baseball

These events and message were designed to attract media coverage.

==Slogans==
Some of their [[political slogan]]s include "Small Government, Big Wars,"&lt;ref&gt;Trav S. D.

A '''burlesque''' is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24999 "Burlesque",] ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word derives from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burlesco}}'', which, in turn, is derived from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burla}}'' – a joke, ridicule or mockery.&lt;ref&gt;In theatrical use, a burla was "a comic interlude or practical joke introduced, usually extempore, into a performance by the servant masks of the [[commedia dell'arte]] … developed at will into a small independent 'turn', the characters returning at its conclusion to the main theme of the plot". See Hartnoll, Phyllis and Peter Found. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t79.e492 "Burla",] ''The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre'',  Oxford University Press, 1996.

Burlesque overlaps in meaning with [[caricature]], [[parody]] and travesty, and, in its theatrical sense, with [[extravaganza]], as presented during the [[Victorian burlesque|Victorian era]].&lt;ref&gt;[[H. W. Fowler|Fowler, H. W.]], rev. [[Ernest Gowers|Sir Ernest Gowers]] (1965). ''Modern English Usage''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 68 and 96&lt;/ref&gt;  "Burlesque" has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century. It has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and to the Graeco-Roman classics.&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;Baldick, Chris. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t56.e153 "Burlesque",] ''The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrasting examples of literary burlesque are [[Alexander Pope]]'s  ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' and [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]''.  An example of musical burlesque is  [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].  Examples of [[Victorian burlesque|theatrical burlesques]] include [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' and the [[A. C. Torr]] – [[Meyer Lutz]] shows, including ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]''.

A later use of the term, [[American burlesque|particularly in the United States]], refers to performances in a [[variety show]] format.  These were popular from the 1860s to the 1940s, often in [[cabaret]]s and clubs, as well as theatres, and featured bawdy comedy and female [[striptease]].  Some Hollywood films attempted to recreate the spirit of these performances from the 1930s to the 1960s, or included burlesque-style scenes within dramatic films, such as 1972's ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' and 1979's ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]'', among others. There has been a resurgence of interest in this format since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sankar-Gorton|first1=Eliza|title=Burlesque Is Back and Here Is What You Need to Know About It|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eliza-sankargorton/burlesque-is-back-and-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-it_b_7176112.html| website=www.huffingtonpost.com|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=30 April 2015|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Petkovic| first1=John| title=Burlesque: Then and now, a timeline of performers from Lili St. Cyr to Dita VonTeese|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2010/11/burlesque_then_and_now_a_timel.html|website=www.cleveland.com|publisher=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=28 November 2010|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary origins and development==
[[File:Arabella-Fermor-crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arabella Fermor, target of ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'']]
The word first appears in a title in [[Francesco Berni]]'s ''Opere burlesche'' of the early 16th century, works that had circulated widely in manuscript before they were printed. For a time, burlesque verses were known as ''poesie bernesca'' in his honour. 'Burlesque' as a literary term became widespread in 17th century Italy and France, and subsequently England, where it referred to a grotesque imitation of the dignified or pathetic.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Fredric Woodbridge Wilson: "Burlesque", ''Grove Music Online'' ed. L. Macy (Accessed December 04, 2008), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s Pyramus and Thisbe scene in ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and the general mocking of romance in Beaumont and Fletcher's ''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' were early examples of such imitation.&lt;ref name=stanton&gt;Stanton, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In 17th century Spain, playwright and poet [[Miguel de Cervantes]] ridiculed medieval romance in his many satirical works. Among Cervantes' works are ''[[Exemplary Novels]]'' and the ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'' published in 1615.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQTtSRP?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570534/burlesque.html Burlesque], ''MSN Encarta'', accessed 18 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The term burlesque has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics.&lt;ref name=Baldick/&gt;

Burlesque was intentionally ridiculous in that it imitated several styles and combined imitations of certain authors and artists with absurd descriptions. In this, the term was often used interchangeably with "[[pastiche]]", "[[parody]]", and the 17th and 18th century genre of the "[[mock-heroic]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Burlesque depended on the reader's (or listener's) knowledge of the subject to make its intended effect, and a high degree of literacy was taken for granted.&lt;ref&gt;Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233&lt;/ref&gt;

17th and 18th century burlesque was divided into two types: '''High burlesque''' refers to a burlesque imitation where a literary, elevated manner was applied to a commonplace or comically inappropriate subject matter as, for example, in the literary [[Parody#English term|parody]] and the [[mock-heroic]]. One of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque is [[Alexander Pope]]'s "sly, knowing and courtly" ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, pp. 290–91&lt;/ref&gt; '''Low burlesque''' applied an irreverent, mocking style to a serious subject; an example is [[Samuel Butler (1612-1680)|Samuel Butler]]'s poem ''[[Hudibras]]'', which described the misadventures of a Puritan knight in satiric [[doggerel]] verse, using a colloquial idiom.  Butler's addition to his comic poem of an ethical subtext made his caricatures into [[satire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hudibras'' was so popular that it became the subject of parody itself.  See Sanders, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, burlesque true to its literary origins is still performed in [[revue]]s and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]].&lt;ref name=stanton/&gt;  [[Tom Stoppard]]'s 1974 play ''[[Travesties]]'' is an example of a full-length play drawing on the burlesque tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, p. 50; and Hunter, Jim (1982) ''Tom Stoppard's Plays''. London: Faber and Faber, {{ISBN|0-571-11903-4}}, pp. 23–33, 141–146 and 237–242&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
{{see also|Parody music}}

===Classical music===
Beginning in the early 18th century, the term burlesque was used throughout Europe to describe musical works in which serious and comic elements were juxtaposed or combined to achieve a grotesque effect.&lt;ref name=kennedy&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; As derived from literature and theatre, "burlesque" was used, and is still used, in music to indicate a bright or high-spirited mood, sometimes in contrast to seriousness.&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;

In this sense of farce and exaggeration rather than parody, it appears frequently on the German-language stage between the middle of the 19th century and the 1920s. Burlesque operettas were written by [[Johann Strauss II]] (''Die lustigen Weiber von Wien'', 1868),&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Strauss, Johann" in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Michael Ziehrer|Ziehrer]] (''Mahomed's Paradies'',1866; ''Das Orakel zu Delfi'', 1872; ''Cleopatra, oder Durch drei Jahrtausende'', 1875; ''In fünfzig Jahren'', 1911)&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Ziehrer, C. M." in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruno Granichstaedten]] (''Casimirs Himmelfahrt'', 1911). French references to burlesque are less common than German, though [[André Grétry|Grétry]] composed for a "drame burlesque" (''Matroco'', 1777).&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, David and M. Elizabeth C. Bartlet, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43361 "Grétry, André-Ernest-Modeste: Works,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 24 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] called his 1916 one-act chamber opera-ballet ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (''The Fox'') a ''"Histoire burlesque chantée et jouée"'' (''burlesque tale sung and played'') and his 1911 ballet ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' a "burlesque in four scenes". A later example is the 1927 burlesque operetta by [[Ernst Krenek]] entitled ''[[Schwergewicht]]'' (''Heavyweight'') (1927).

Some orchestral and chamber works have also been designated as burlesques, of which two early examples are the Ouverture-Suite ''Burlesque de Quixotte'', TWV 55, by [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and the Sinfonia Burlesca by [[Leopold Mozart]] (1760). Another often-performed piece is [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;  Other examples include the following:
*1901: Six Burlesques, Op. 58 for piano four hands by [[Max Reger]]
*1904: Scherzo Burlesque, Op. 2 for piano and orchestra by [[Béla Bartók]]
*1911: Three Burlesques, Op. 8c for piano by Bartók
*1920: Burlesque for Piano, by [[Arnold Bax]]
*1931: Ronde burlesque, Op. 78 for orchestra by [[Florent Schmitt]]
*1932: Fantaisie burlesque, for piano by [[Olivier Messiaen]]
*1956: Burlesque for Piano and Chamber Orchestra, Op. 13g by [[Bertold Hummel]]
*1982: Burlesque for Wind Quintet, Op. 76b by Hummel

Burlesque can be used to describe particular movements of instrumental musical compositions, often involving dance rhythms. Examples are the Burlesca, in [[Partitas, BWV 825-830|Partita No. 3 for keyboard (BWV 827)]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], the "Rondo-Burleske" third movement of [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]] by [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], and the "Burlesque" fourth movement of [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1]].&lt;ref&gt;McGregor, Andrew, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/mmzf "Dmitri Shostakovich Violin Concertos 1 &amp; 2 Review"], BBC Music, accessed 24 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jazz===
The use of burlesque has not been confined to classical music. Well known [[ragtime]] travesties include ''The Russian Rag'', by [[George L. Cobb]], which is based on [[Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in C-sharp minor]], and [[Harry L. Alford|Harry Alford]]'s  ''Lucy's Sextette'' based on the [[sextet]], 'Chi mi frena in tal momento?', from ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' by [[Donizetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Max (2006): ''Rachmaninoff: Life, Works, Recordings'' p 229&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victorian theatrical burlesque==
[[File:Florence St. John.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Florence St. John]] in ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'']]
{{main|Victorian burlesque}}
Victorian burlesque, sometimes known as "travesty" or "[[extravaganza]]",&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; was popular in London theatres between the 1830s and the 1890s.  It took the form of [[parody music|musical theatre parody]] in which a well-known opera, play or ballet was adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, often risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work.  The comedy often stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the modern activities portrayed by the actors.  [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  Other authors of burlesques included [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].&lt;ref name=times70/&gt;

Victorian burlesque related to and in part derived from traditional English [[pantomime]] "with the addition of gags and 'turns'."&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early burlesques, following the example of [[ballad opera]], the words of the songs were written to popular music;&lt;ref&gt;Moss,  Harold Gene. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/830406 "Popular Music and the Ballad Opera",] ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'', Vol. 26, No. 3 (Autumn, 1973), pp. 365–82, University of California Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; later burlesques mixed the music of [[opera]], [[operetta]], [[music hall]] and [[revue]], and some of the more ambitious shows had original music composed for them.  This English style of burlesque was successfully introduced to New York in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Delmer D. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/779924 "Public Music Performances in New York City from 1800 to 1850",] ''Anuario Interamericano de Investigacion Musical'', Vol. 6 (1970), pp. 5–50, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Faustupto.jpg|thumb|150px|Sheet music from ''[[Faust up to Date]]''|left]]
Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera.&lt;ref name=marvin&gt;Marvin, Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), pp. 33–66, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wells&gt;Wells, Stanley.

Macbeth asks Banquo, "What mean these salutations, noble thane?" and is told, "These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'".&lt;ref name=wells/&gt; A staple of burlesque was the display of attractive women in [[Breeches role|travesty roles]], dressed in tights to show off their legs, but the plays themselves were seldom more than modestly risqué.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

[[File:Ruy-blas-programme-crop.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Souvenir programme|Programme]]: ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'']]
Burlesque became the speciality of certain London theatres, including the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]] and [[Royal Strand Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.  Until the 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize.  The house stars included [[Nellie Farren]], [[John D'Auban]], [[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]] and [[Fred Leslie]].&lt;ref name=times70&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  From about 1880, Victorian burlesques grew longer, until they were a whole evening's entertainment rather than part of a double- or triple-bill.&lt;ref name=times70/&gt;  In the early 1890s, these burlesques went out of fashion in London, and the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new more wholesome but less literary genre of [[Edwardian musical comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, Kurt.

==American burlesque==
[[File:Bon-Ton Burlesquers2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Advertisement for a burlesque troupe, 1898]]
{{main|American burlesque}}
American burlesque shows were originally an offshoot of Victorian burlesque. The English genre had been successfully staged in New York from the 1840s, and it was popularised by a visiting British burlesque troupe, [[Lydia Thompson]] and the "British Blondes", beginning in 1868.&lt;ref name=Friends&gt;Hoffos, Signe and Moulder, Bob.  [http://www.kensalgreen.co.uk/documents/FOKGC43_Thompson.pdf "Desperately Seeking Lydia" and "Appreciating Lydia",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513080257/http://www.kensalgreen.co.uk/documents/FOKGC43_Thompson.pdf |date=2011-05-13 }} ''The Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery Magazine'', Vol. 43, Autumn 2006, pp. 1–7&lt;/ref&gt;  New York burlesque shows soon incorporated elements and the structure of the popular [[minstrel show]]s. They consisted of three parts: first, songs and ribald comic sketches by low comedians; second, assorted [[Olio (musical number)|olios]] and male acts, such as acrobats, magicians and solo singers; and third, chorus numbers and sometimes a burlesque in the English style on politics or a current play. The entertainment was usually concluded by an exotic dancer or a wrestling or boxing match.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;[http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9018177 "Burlesque show",] ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Online Library Edition, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While burlesque went out of fashion in England towards the end of the 19th century, to be replaced by [[Edwardian musical comedy]], the American style of burlesque flourished, but with increasing focus on female nudity. Exotic "cooch" dances were brought in, ostensibly Syrian in origin.  The entertainments were given in clubs and cabarets, as well as music halls and theatres. By the early 20th century, there were two national circuits of burlesque shows competing with the [[vaudeville]] circuit, as well as resident companies in New York, such as [[Minsky's Burlesque|Minsky's]] at the Winter Garden.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

The transition from burlesque on the old lines to striptease was gradual. At first, [[soubrette]]s showed off their figures while singing and dancing; some were less active but compensated by appearing in elaborate stage costumes.&lt;ref name=humez&gt;Humez, Nick.

Comics who appeared in burlesque early in their careers included [[Fanny Brice]], [[Mae West]], [[Eddie Cantor]], [[Abbott and Costello]], [[W. C.

'''Camera obscura''' (plural ''camera obscura'' or ''camera obscuras'';&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/spelling/plurals-of-nouns Oxford English Dictionary. Plurals of foreign nouns]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/249903/plural-of-camera-obscura Stack Exchange: Plural of ''camera obscura'']&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Latin]], meaning "dark room": ''camera'' "(vaulted) chamber or room," and ''obscura'' "darkened, dark"), also referred to as '''pinhole image''', is the natural optical phenomenon that occurs when an image of a scene at the other side of a screen (or for instance a wall) is projected through a small hole in that screen as a reversed and inverted image (left to right and upside down) on a surface opposite to the opening. The surroundings of the projected image have to be relatively dark for the image to be clear, so many historical camera obscura experiments were performed in dark rooms.

The term "camera obscura" also refers to constructions or devices that make use of the principle within a box, tent or room. Camerae obscurae with a lens in the opening have been used since the second half of the 16th century and became popular as an aid for drawing and painting. The camera obscura box was developed further into the [[Camera|photographic camera]] in the first half of the 19th century when camera obscura boxes were used to expose light-sensitive materials to the projected image.

The camera obscura was used as a means to study eclipses, without the risk of damaging the eyes by looking into the sun directly. As a drawing aid, the camera obscura allowed tracing the projected image to produce a highly accurate representation, especially appreciated as an easy way to achieve a proper [[graphical perspective]].

Before the term "camera obscura" was first used in 1604, many other expressions were used including "cubiculum obscurum", "cubiculum tenebricosum", "conclave obscurum" and "locus obscurus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Optic projection, principles, installation, and use of the magic lantern, projection microscope, reflecting lantern, moving picture machine|year=1914|last=Phelps Gage|first=Henry|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vtFUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22obscurum+cubiculum%22&amp;dq=%22obscurum+cubiculum%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A camera obscura device without a lens but with a very small hole is sometimes referred to as a "[[pinhole camera]]", although this more often refers to simple (home-made) lens-less cameras in which photographic film or photographic paper is used.

==Physical explanation==
Rays of light travel in straight lines and change when they are reflected and partly absorbed by an object, retaining information about the color and brightness of the surface of that object. Lit objects reflect rays of light in all directions. A small enough opening in a screen only lets through rays that travel directly from different points in the scene on the other side and these rays form an image of that scene when they are collected on a surface opposite the opening. In simple, the way your retina sees a specific image through your eye is vertically switched to the object you see and how pieces in your brain are shown to switch that object right-side up to the way you see normally

The [[human eye]] (as well as those of other animals including birds, fish reptiles  etc.) works much like a camera obscura with an opening ([[pupil]]), a biconvex [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] and a surface where the image is formed ([[retina]]).

==Technology==
[[Image:Camera obscura box.jpg|left|thumb|A diagram of a camera obscura with an upright projected image at the top.]]
A camera obscura device consists of a box, tent or room with a small hole in one side. Light from an external scene passes through the hole and strikes a surface inside, where the scene is reproduced, inverted (thus upside-down) and reversed (left to right), but with color and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] preserved.  

In order to produce a reasonably clear projected image, the aperture has to be about 1/100th the distance to the screen, or less.

As the pinhole is made smaller, the image gets sharper, but the projected image becomes dimmer. With too small a pinhole, however, the sharpness worsens, due to [[diffraction]].

Many camerae obscurae use a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] rather than a pinhole (as in a [[pinhole camera]]) because it allows a larger [[F-number|aperture]], giving a usable brightness while maintaining focus.

If the image is caught on a semi-transparent screen, it can be viewed from the back so that it is no longer reversed (but still upside-down).

Using mirrors it is possible to project a right-side-up image. The projection can also be diverted onto a horizontal surface (e.g. a table). The 18th-century overhead version in tents used mirrors inside a kind of periscope on the top of the tent . 

The box-type camera obscura often has an angled mirror projecting an upright image onto [[tracing paper]] placed on the glass top. Although the image is viewed from the back, it is now reversed by the mirror.

==History==

===30,000 BCE to 500 BCE: Possible inspiration for prehistoric art and possible use in religious ceremonies, gnomon===
There are theories that occurrences of camera obscura effects (through tiny holes in tents or in screens of animal hide) inspired [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s. Distortions in the shapes of animals in many paleolithic cave artworks might be inspired by distortions seen when the surface on which an image was projected was not straight or not in the right angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/paleolithic/ |title=Paleolithic |publisher=paleo-camera |date= |accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also suggested that camera obscura projections could have played a role in [[Neolithic]] structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/neolithic/ |title=Neolithic |publisher=paleo-camera |accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jennifer Ouellette |url=https://gizmodo.com/did-prehistoric-people-watch-the-stars-through-this-6-0-1782759791 |title=deadspin-quote-carrot-aligned-w-bgr-2 |publisher=Gizmodo |date=2016-06-29 |accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perforated [[gnomon]]s projecting a pinhole image of the sun were described in the Chinese [[Zhoubi Suanjing]] writings (1046 BCE—256 BCE with material added until circa 220 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyssAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22pierced+gnomon%22&amp;dq=%22pierced+gnomon%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi87Y3Ex4fSAhXPFsAKHRNaDZEQ6AEIOzAG|title=The Asiatic Review|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of the bright circle can be measured to tell the time of day and year. In Arab and European cultures its invention was much later attributed to Egyptian astronomer and mathematician [[Ibn Yunus]] around 1000 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=msaqctAH8OkC&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=%22pierced%20gnomon%22&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=perforated&amp;f=false|title=Sundials: History, Theory, and Practice|last=Rohr|first=René R.J.|year=2012|isbn=9780486151700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ancient sightings of gods and spirits, especially in temple worship, are thought to possibly have been conjured up by means of camera obscura projections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/ancient-greece/ |title=Ancient Greece |publisher=paleo-camera |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date= 2004 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BIL2BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Ghost Images: Cinema of the Afterlife |last= Ruffles |first=Tom |pages= 15–17|isbn= 9780786420056 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=needham4&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|title=Science and Civilization in China, vol.

===500 BCE to 500 CE: Earliest written observations===
[[Image:IMG 1650 zonsverduistering Malta.JPG|thumb|Holes in the leaf canopy project images of a [[solar eclipse]] on the ground.]]
The earliest known written record of the camera obscura is to be found in Chinese writings called [[Mozi (book)|Mozi]] and dated to the 4th century BCE, traditionally ascribed to and named for [[Mozi]] (circa 470 BCE-circa 391 BCE), a [[History of Science and Technology in China|Han Chinese]] philosopher and the founder of [[Mohism|Mohist School of Logic]]. In these writings it is explained how the inverted image in a "collecting-point" or "treasure house"&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In the ''Mozi'' passage, a camera obscura is described as a "collecting-point" or "treasure house" ([[wikt:庫|庫]]); the 18th century scholar Bi Yuan ([[:zh:畢沅|畢沅]]) suggested this was a misprint for "screen" ([[wikt:㢓|㢓]]).&lt;/ref&gt; is inverted by an intersecting point (a pinhole) that collected the (rays of) light. Light coming from the foot of an illuminated person would partly be hidden below (strike below the pinhole) and partly form the top part of the image. Rays from the head would partly be hidden above (strike above the pinhole) and partly form the lower part of the image. This is a remarkably early correct description of the camera obscura; there are no other examples known that are dated before the 11th century.&lt;ref name=needham4/&gt;

The Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384-322 BCE), or possibly a follower of his ideas, touched upon the subject in the work ''[[Problems (Aristotle)|Problems]] - Book XV'', asking: {{quote|"Why is it that when the sun passes through quadri-laterals, as for instance in wickerwork, it does not produce a figure rectangular in shape but circular?”}} and further on: {{quote|“Why is it that an eclipse of the sun, if one looks at it through a sieve or through leaves, such as a plane-tree or other broadleaved tree, or if one joins the fingers of one hand over the fingers of the other, the rays are crescent-shaped where they reach the earth? Is it for the same reason as that when light shines through a rectangular peep-hole, it appears circular in the form of a cone?"}}

Many philosophers and scientists of the Western world would ponder this question before it became accepted that the circular and crescent-shapes described in this "problem" were actually pinhole image projections of the sun. Although a projected image will have the shape of the aperture when the light source, aperture and projection plane are close together, the projected image will have the shape of the light source when they are further apart.

[[Euclid]] is sometimes reported to have mentioned the camera obscura phenomenon as a demonstration that light travels in straight lines in his very influential ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' (circa 300 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Volume 1|page=465|last=Ben-Menahem|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9tUrarQYhKMC&amp;lpg=PA965&amp;dq=euclid%20inverted%20image&amp;pg=PA965#v=onepage&amp;q=euclid%20inverted%20image&amp;f=false|isbn=9783540688310|date=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in common translations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://philomatica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Optics-of-Euclid.pdf|title=Optics of Euclid}}&lt;/ref&gt; no remarks of anything that resembles camera obscura can be found. Claims could be based on later versions, since [[Ignazio Danti]] added a description of camera obscura in his 1573 annotated translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonnerweb.de/bilder/pinhole/sonnentaler/sonnentaler.htm|language=german|title=Kleine Geschichte der Lochkamera oder Camera Obscura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] scholar [[Theon of Alexandria]] observed that "candlelight passing through a pinhole will create an illuminated spot on a screen that is directly in line with the aperture and the center of the candle."&lt;ref&gt;''Inside the Box: A Proven System of Creativity for Breakthrough Results'' {{ISBN|978-1-451-65930-6}} p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

===500 to 1100: Experiments, study of light===
[[File:555 anthemius of tralles - light-diagram.jpg|thumb|Anthemius of Tralles' diagram of light-rays reflected with plane mirror through hole (B)]]
In the 6th century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine-Greek]] mathematician and architect [[Anthemius of Tralles]] (most famous as co-architect of the [[Hagia Sophia]]), experimented with effects related to the camera obscura.&lt;ref name="Crombie1990"&gt;G. Huxley (1959) ''Anthemius of Tralles: a study of later Greek Geometry'' pp. 6-8, pp.44-46 as cited in {{Harv|Crombie|1990}}, p.205&lt;/ref&gt; Anthemius had a sophisticated understanding of the involved optics, as demonstrated by a light-ray diagram he constructed in 555 CE.&lt;ref name=renner2012&gt;{{cite book|url=http://foto.art.br/alternativa/PinholePhoto.pdf|title=Pinhole Photography: From Historic Technique to Digital Application|first=Eric|last=Renner|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century, [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus) demonstrated that "light from the right side of the flame will pass through the aperture and end up on the left side of the screen, while light from the left side of the flame will pass through the aperture and end up on the right side of the screen."{{citation needed|Location=http://www.kirriemuircameraobscura.com/history-camera-obscuras|date=September 2017}}

In the 10th century Yu Chao-Lung supposedly projected images of pagoda models through a small hole onto a screen to study directions and divergence of rays of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The camera obscura: a chronicle|last=Hammond|first=John H.|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W-ZTAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Yu+Chao-Lung%22&amp;dq=%22Yu+Chao-Lung%22|year=1981|isbn=9780852744512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arab]] [[physicist]] [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (known in the West by the Latinised Alhazen) (965–1039) explained in his [[Book of Optics]] (circa 1027) that rays of light travel in straight lines and are distinguished by the body that reflected the rays and then wrote:
{{quote|"Evidence that light and color do not mingle in air or (other) transparent bodies is (found in) the fact that, when several candles are at various distinct locations in the same area, and when they all face a window that opens into a dark recess, and when there is a white wall or (other white) opaque body in the dark recess facing that window, the (individual) lights of those candles appear individually upon that body or wall according to the number of those candles; and each of those lights (spots of light) appears directly opposite one (particular) candle along a straight line passing through that window. Moreover, if one candle is shielded, only the light opposite that candle is extinguished, but if the shielding object is lifted, the light will return."&lt;ref&gt;* Smith, A. Mark, ed. and trans.

The image of the sun shows this peculiarity only when the hole is very small. When the hole is enlarged, the picture changes, and the change increases with the added width. When the aperture is very wide, the sickle-form image will disappear, and the light will appear round when the hole is round, square if the hole is square, and if the shape of the opening is irregular, the light on the wall will take on this shape, provided that the hole is wide and the plane on which it is thrown is parallel to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY|last=Eder|first=JOSEF MARIA|year=1945|page=37|url=https://archive.org/stream/EderHistoryPhotography/aa045%20-%20ederHistoryPhotography_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Al-Haytham also analyzed the rays of sunlight and concluded that they make a conic shape where they meet at the hole, forming another conic shape reverse to the first one from the hole to the opposite wall in the dark room. Ibn al-Haytham is reported to have stated about the camera obscura: "We did not invent this".&lt;ref name=Zahn&gt;[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/13071/20040303-0000/www.acmi.net.au/AIC/CAMERA_OBSCURA.html Adventures in CyberSound: The Camera Obscura&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; al-Haytam's writings on optics became very influential in Europe through Latin translations since circa 1200.

In his 1088 book ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' the [[Song Dynasty]] Chinese scientist [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095) compared the focal point of a concave burning-mirror and the "collecting" hole of  camera obscura phenomena to an oar in a rowlock to explain how the images were inverted:
{{quote|"When a bird flies in the air, its shadow moves along the ground in the same direction. But if its image is collected (''shu'')(like a belt being tightened) through a small hole in a window, then the shadow moves in the direction opposite of that of the bird.[...] This is the same principle as the burning-mirror. Such a mirror has a concave surface, and reflects a finger to give an upright image if the object is very near, but if the finger moves farther and farther away it reaches a point where the image disappears and after that the image appears inverted. Thus the point where the image disappears is like the pinhole of the window. So also the oar is fixed at the rowlock somewhere at its middle part, constituting, when it is moved, a sort of 'waist' and the handle of the oar is always in the position inverse to the end (which is in the water)."}}

Shen Kuo also responded to a statement of [[Duan Chengshi]] in ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'' written in about 840 that the inverted image of a [[Chinese pagoda]] tower beside a seashore, was inverted because it was reflected by the sea: "This is nonsense. It is a normal principle that the image is inverted after passing through the small hole."&lt;ref name=needham4/&gt;

English statesman and [[scholasticism|scholastic philosopher]] [[Robert Grosseteste]] (c. 1175 – 9 October 1253) commented on the camera obscura.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/index/R2717G210K21R7R2.pdf A reconsideration of Roger Bacon's theory of pinhole images]&lt;/ref&gt;

English philosopher and Franciscan friar [[Roger Bacon]] (c. 1219/20 – c. 1292) falsely stated in his ''De Multiplicatione Specerium'' (1267) that an image projected through a square aperture was round because light would travel in spherical waves and therefore assumed its natural shape after passing through a hole. He is also credited with a manuscript that advised to study solar eclipses safely by observing the rays passing through some round hole and studying the spot of light they form on a surface.&lt;ref name=Mannoni1&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_great_art_of_light_and_shadow.html?id=t_cSAQAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|last=Mannoni|first=Laurent|title=The great art of light and shadow|year=2000|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish friar, theologian, physicist, mathematician and natural philosopher [[Vitello|Erazmus Ciołek Witelo]] (also known as Vitello Thuringopolonis and by many different spellings of the name "Witelo") wrote about the camera obscura in his very influential treatise ''Perspectiva'' (circa 1270-1278), which was largely based on Ibn al-Haytham's work.

English archbishop and scholar [[John Peckham]] (circa 1230 – 1292) wrote about the camera obscura in his ''Tractatus de Perspectiva'' (circa 1269-1277) and ''Perspectiva communis'' (circa 1277-79), falsely arguing that light gradually forms the circular shape after passing through the aperture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tractatus de perspectiva|last1=Lindberg|first1=David C.|last2=Pecham|first2=John|year=1972|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UytDAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP7&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22John%20Peckham%22&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q=camera&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings were influenced by Roger Bacon.

French astronomer Guillaume de Saint-Cloud suggested in his 1292 work ''Almanach Planetarum'' that the eccentricity of the sun could be determined with the camera obscura from the inverse proportion between the distances and the apparent solar diameters at apogee and perigee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=J.L.|last=Mancha|title=Studies in Medieval Astronomy and Optics|pages=275–297|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02KQgQNL-P4C&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;ots=gKQwDqRa6M&amp;dq=%22william%20of%20saint-cloud%22%20camera&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=%22william%20of%20saint-cloud%22%20camera&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī]] (1267–1319) described in his 1309 work ''Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir'' (''The Revision of the Optics'') how he experimented with a glass sphere filled with water in a camera obscura with a controlled aperture and found that the colors of the rainbow are phenomena of the decomposition of light.&lt;ref&gt;Nader El-Bizri, "Optics", in ''Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia'', ed.

French Jewish philosopher, mathematician, physicist and astronomer/astrologer [[Gersonides|Levi ben Gershon]] (1288–1344) (also known as Gersonides or Leo de Balneolis) made several astronomical observations using a camera obscura with a [[Jacob's staff]], describing methods to measure the angular diameters of the sun, the moon and the bright planets Venus and Jupiter. He determined the eccentricity of the sun based on his observations of the summer and winter solstices in 1334. Levi also noted how the size of the aperture determined the size of the projected image. He wrote about his findings in Hebrew in his treatise ''Sefer Milhamot Ha-Shem'' (''The Wars of the Lord'') Book V Chapters 5 and 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Astronomy of Levi ben Gerson|pages=140–143|last=Goldstein|first=Bernard R.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETOtBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;ots=kijNtMR0LE&amp;dq=%22Levi%20Ben%20Gerson%22%20camera&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Levi%20Ben%20Gerson%22%20camera&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian polymath [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519), familiar with the work of Alhazen in Latin translation{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} and after an extensive study of optics and human vision, wrote the oldest known clear description of the camera obscura in mirror writing in a notebook in 1502, later published in the collection ''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'' (translated from Latin):

{{quote|If the facade of a building, or a place, or a landscape is illuminated by the sun and a small hole is drilled in the wall of a room in a building facing this, which is not directly lighted by the sun, then all objects illuminated by the sun will send their images through this aperture and will appear, upside down, on the wall facing the hole.
You will catch these pictures on a piece of white paper, which placed vertically in the room not far from that opening, and you will see all the above-mentioned objects on this paper in their natural shapes or colors, but they will appear smaller and upside down, on account of crossing of the rays at that aperture. If these pictures originate from a place which is illuminated by the sun, they will appear colored on the paper exactly as they are. The paper should be very thin and must be viewed from the back.&lt;ref&gt;Josef Maria Eder ''History of Photography'' translated by Edward Epstean Hon. F.R.P.S Copyright Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These descriptions, however, would remain unknown until Venturi deciphered and published them in 1797.&lt;ref name=Repstad&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jongrepstad.com/pinhole-photography/pinhole-photography-history-images-cameras-formulas/|title=Pinhole Photography – History, Images, Cameras, Formulas|first=Jon|last=Grepstad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Da Vinci was clearly very interested in the camera obscura: over the years he drew circa 270 diagrams of the camera obscura in his notebooks . He systematically experimented with various shapes and sizes of apertures and with multiple apertures (1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 24, 28 and 32). He compared the working of the eye to that of the camera obscura and seemed especially interested in its capability of demonstrating basic principles of optics: the inversion of images through the pinhole or pupil, the non-interference of images and the fact that images are "all in all and all in every part".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sumscorp.com/leonardo_studies/news_98.html |title=Leonardo and the Camera Obscura / Kim Veltman |publisher=Sumscorp.com |date=1986-12-02 |accessdate=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known published drawing of a camera obscura is found in Dutch physician, mathematician and instrument maker [[Gemma Frisius]]’ 1545 book ''De Radio Astronomica et Geometrica'', in which he described and illustrated how he used the camera obscura to study the solar eclipse of January 24, 1544&lt;ref name=Repstad/&gt;

Italian polymath [[Gerolamo Cardano]] described using a glass disc - probably a [[biconvex lens]] - in a camera obscura in his 1550 book ''De subtilitate, vol. I, Libri IV''. He suggested to use it to view "what takes place in the street when the sun shines" and advised to use a very white sheet of paper as a projection screen so the colours wouldn't be dull.&lt;ref name=Ilardi /&gt;

Sicilian mathematician and astronomer [[Francesco Maurolico]] (1494-1575) answered Aristotle's problem how sunlight that shines through rectangular holes can form round spots of light or crescent-shaped spots during an eclipse in his treatise ''Photismi de lumine et umbra'' (1521-1554). However this wasn't published before 1611,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Photismi de lumine et umbra|year=1611|last=Maurolico|first=Francesco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ug6ywn-D9BgC&amp;pg=PP9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Johannes Kepler had published similar findings of his own.

Italian polymath [[Giambattista della Porta]] described the camera obscura, which he called "obscurum cubiculum", in the 1558 first edition of his book series ''[[Magia Naturalis]]''. He suggested to use a convex mirror to project the image onto paper and to use this as a drawing aid. Della Porta compared the human eye to the camera obscura: "For the image is let into the eye through the eyeball just as here through the window". The popularity of Della Porta's books helped spread knowledge of the camera obscura.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williamshakespeare-sonnets.com/sonnet-24|last=Larsen|first=Kenneth|title=Sonnet 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durbin|first=P.T.|year=2012|title=Philosophy of Technology|page=74|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2OSBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;ots=UmoBlPH0x3&amp;dq=Robert%20Fludd%20camera%20obscura&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q=Robert%20Fludd%20camera%20obscura&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1567 work ''La Pratica della Perspettiva'' Venetian nobleman [[Daniele Barbaro]] (1513-1570) described using a camera obscura with a biconvex lens as a drawing aid and points out that the picture is more vivid if the lens is covered as much as to leave a circumference in the middle.&lt;ref name=Ilardi&gt;{{cite book|title=Renaissance Vision from Spectacles to Telescopes|last=Ilardi|first=Vincent|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=peIL7hVQUmwC&amp;lpg=PA219&amp;ots=0nY6rITCY6&amp;dq=Cardano%20De%20subtilitate%20libri%20camera%20obscura&amp;pg=PA220#v=onepage&amp;q=Cardano%20De%20subtilitate%20libri%20camera%20obscura&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his influential and meticulously annotated Latin edition of the works of Al-Haytam and Witelo ''Opticae thesauru'' (1572) German mathematician [[Friedrich Risner]] proposed a portable camera obscura drawing aid; a lightweight wooden hut with lenses in each of its four walls that would project images of the surroundings on a paper cube in the middle. The construction could be carried on two wooden poles.&lt;ref name=Snyder&gt;{{cite web|title=Eye of the Beholder|last=Snyder|first=Laura J.|year=2015|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQJ-BAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT110&amp;ots=fqygKmz1u-&amp;dq=friedrich%20risner%20camera%20obscura&amp;pg=PT110#v=onepage&amp;q=friedrich%20risner%20camera%20obscura&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A very similar setup was illustrated in 1645 in [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s influential book ''Ars Magna Lucis Et Umbrae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wYlDAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA806 |title= Ars Magna Lucis Et Umbrae |year=1645 |last=Kircher |first=Athanasius |language=Latin |page=806b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1575 Italian Dominican priest, mathematician, astronomer, and cosmographer [[Ignazio Danti]] designed a camera obscura gnomom and a meridian line for the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella]], Florence and he later had a massive gnomon built in the [[San Petronio Basilica]] in Bologna. The gnomon was used to study the movements of the sun during the year and helped in determining the new Gregorian calendar for which Danti took place in the commission appointed by [[Pope Gregory XIII|Pope Gregorius XIII]] and instituted in 1582.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cassini|title=1655-2005: 350 Years of the Great Meridian Line|url=http://stelle.bo.astro.it/archivio/2005-anno-cassiniano/meridian_ing.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This leaves the image reversed, but would become common practice in later camera obscura boxes.&lt;ref name=Ilardi /&gt;

Giambattista della Porta added a “lenticular crystal” or biconvex lens to the camera obscura description in the 1589 second edition of ''Magia Naturalis''. He also described use of the camera obscura to project hunting scenes, banquets, battles, plays or anything desired on white sheets. Trees, forests, rivers, mountains "that are really so, or made by Art, of Wood, or some other matter" could be arranged on a plain in the sunshine on the other side of the camera obscura wall. Little children and animals (for instance handmade deer, wild boars, rhinos, elephants and lions) could perform in this set. "Then by degrees they must appear, as coming out of their dens, upon the Plain: The Hunter he must come with his hunting Pole, Nets, Arrows, and other necessaries, that may represent hunting: Let there be Horns, Cornets, Trumpets sounded: those that are in the Chamber shall see Trees, Animals, Hunters Faces, and all the rest so plainly, that they cannot tell whether they be true or delusions: Swords drawn will glister in at the hole, that they will make people almost afraid." 
Della Porta claimed to have shown such spectacles often to his friends. They admired it very much and could hardly be convinced by Della Porta's explanations that what they had seen was really an optical trick. &lt;ref name=Larsen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A55484.0001.001/1:20?rgn=div1;view=fulltext |title=Natural Magick (Book XVII, Chap.

The earliest use of the term "camera obscura" is found in the 1604 book ''Ad Vitellionem Paralipomena'' by German mathematician, astronomer, and astrologer [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dupre |first1=Sven |title=Inside the "Camera Obscura": Kepler's Experiment and Theory of Optical Imagery |journal=Early Science and Medicin |date=2008 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=219–244 |jstor=20617729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kepler discovered the working of the camera obscura by recreating its principle with a book replacing a shining body and sending threads from its edges through a many-cornered aperture in a table onto the floor where the threads recreated the shape of the book. He also realized that images are "painted" inverted and reversed on the retina of the eye and figured that this is somehow corrected by the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theories of Vision from Al-kindi to Kepler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-8A_auBvyFoC&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=kepler%20camera%20obscura%20eye&amp;pg=PA186#v=onepage&amp;q=kepler%20camera%20obscura%20eye&amp;f=false|last=Lindberg|first=David C.|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1611 book ''Dioptrice'' Kepler described how the projected image of the camera obscura can be improved and reverted with a lens. It is believed he later used a telescope with three lenses to revert the image in the camera obscura.&lt;ref name=Ilardi /&gt;

In 1611 Frisian/German astronomers [[David Fabricius|David]] and [[Johannes Fabricius]] (father and son) studied sunspots with a camera obscura, after realizing looking at the sun directly with the telescope could damage their eyes.&lt;ref name =aps/&gt; They are thought to have combined the telescope and the camera obscura into camera obscura telescopy.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In 1612 Italian mathematician [[Benedetto Castelli]] wrote to his mentor, the Italian astronomer, physicist, engineer, philosopher and mathematician [[Galileo Galilei]] about projecting images of the sun through a [[telescope]] (invented in 1608) to study the recently discovered sunspots. Galilei wrote about Castelli's technique to the German Jesuit priest, physicist and astronomer Christoph Scheiner.&lt;ref name=Whitehouse/&gt;

From 1612 to at least 1630 [[Christoph Scheiner]] would keep on studying sunspots and constructing new telescopic solar projection systems. He called these "Heliotropii Telioscopici", later contracted to [[helioscope]].&lt;ref name=Whitehouse&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eHgCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT82&amp;ots=-EVwXlh4Hi&amp;dq=heliotropii%20telioscopici&amp;pg=PT82#v=onepage&amp;q=castelli&amp;f=false|title=The Sun: A Biography|last=Whitehouse|first=David|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his helioscope studies Scheiner built a box around the viewing/projecting end of the telescope, which can be seen as the oldest known version of a box-type camera obscura.

By 1620 Kepler used a portable camera obscura tent with a modified telescope to draw landscapes. It could be turned around to capture the surroundings in parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/servlet/DCARead?standardNo=0192159674&amp;standardNoType=1&amp;excerpt=true|title=Vermeer's camera|last=Steadman|first=Philip|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch inventor [[Cornelis Drebbel]] is thought to have constructed a box-type camera obscura which corrected the inversion of the projected image. In 1622 he sold one to the Dutch poet, composer and diplomat [[Constantijn Huygens]] who used it to paint and recommended it to his artist friends.&lt;ref name=Snyder/&gt; Huygens wrote to his parents (translated from French):{{quote|I have at home Drebbel's other instrument, which certainly makes admirable effects in painting from reflection in a dark room; it is not possible for me to reveal the beauty to you in words; all painting is dead by comparison, for here is life itself or something more elevated if one could articulate it.

German [[oriental studies|Orientalist]], mathematician, inventor, poet, and librarian [[Daniel Schwenter]] wrote in his 1636 book ''Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae'' about an instrument that a man from [[Pappenheim]] had shown him, which enabled movement of a lens to project more from a scene through the camera obscura. It consisted of a ball as big as a fist, through which a hole (AB) was made with a lens attached on one side (B). This ball was placed inside two halves of part of a hollow ball that were then glued together (CD), in which it could be turned around. This device was attached to a wall of the camera obscura (EF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel|last=Schwenter|year=1636|page=255|language=German|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=EWM_AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;pg=GBS.PA255|title=Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[universal joint]] mechanism was later called a [[scioptric ball]].

In his 1637 book ''Dioptrique'' French philosopher, mathematician and scientist [[René Descartes]] suggested placing an eye of a recently dead man (or if a dead man was unavailable, the eye of an ox) into an opening in a darkened room and scraping away the flesh at the back until one could see the inverted image formed on the retina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YSUUONfamiEC&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;ots=c6yoVajBPR&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Ctaking%20the%20dead%20eye%20of%20a%20newly%20dead%20person%20(or%20failing%20that%2C%20the%20eye%20of%20an%20ox%20or%20some%20other%20large%20animal)%E2%80%9D&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Ctaking%20the%20dead%20eye%20of%20a%20newly%20dead%20person%20(or%20failing%20that,%20the%20eye%20of%20an%20ox%20or%20some%20other%20large%20animal)%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false/|title=Theatre and Performance Design: A Reader in Scenographyy|last=Collins|first=Jane|year=2012|first2=Andrew|last2=Nisbet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1642 Mario Bettini - Apiaria universae philosophiae mathematica.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a twelve-hole camera obscura from Bettini's ''Apiaria universae philosophiae mathematicae" (1642)]]
Italian Jesuit philosopher, mathematician and astronomer [[Mario Bettinus|Mario Bettini]] wrote about making a camera obscura with twelve holes in his ''Apiaria universae philosophiae mathematicae'' (1642). When a foot soldier would stand in front of the camera, a twelve person army of soldiers making the same movements would be projected.

French mathematician, [[Minim (religious order)|Minim friar]], and painter of [[Anamorphosis|anamorphic art]] [[Jean François Niceron|Jean-François Nicéron]] (1613-1646) wrote about the camera obscura with convex lenses. He explained how the camera obscura could be used by painters to achieve perfect perspective in their work. He also complained how charlatans abused the camera obscura to fool witless spectators and make them believe that the projections were magic or occult science. These writings were published in a posthumous version of ''La Perspective Curieuse'' (1652).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRf37hPYOYUC|title=La Perspective curieuse|year=1652|last=Nicéron|first=Jean François|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1650 to 1800: Introduction of the magic lantern, popular portable box-type drawing aid, painting aid===
The use of the camera obscura to project special shows to entertain an audience seems to have remained very rare. A description of what was most likely such a show in 1656 in France, was penned by the poet [[Jean Loret]]. The Parisian society were presented with upside-down images of palaces, ballet dancing and battling with swords. The performance was silent and Loret was surprised that all the movements made no sound. Loret felt somewhat frustrated that he did not know the secret that made this spectacle possible. There are several clues that this was a camera obscura show, rather than a very early magic lantern show, especially in the upside-down image and the energetic movements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magiclantern.org.uk/new-magic-lantern-journal/pdfs/4008787a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

German Jesuit scientist [[Gaspar Schott]] heard from a traveler about a small camera obscura device he had seen in Spain, which one could carry under one arm and could be hidden under a coat. He then constructed his own sliding box camera obscura, which could focus by sliding a wooden box part fitted inside another wooden box part. He wrote about this in his 1657 ''Magia universalis naturæ et artis'' (volume 1 - book 4 "Magia Optica" pages 199-201).

By 1659 the [[magic lantern]] was introduced and partly replaced the camera obscura as a projection device, while the camera obscura mostly remained popular as a drawing aid. The magic lantern can be seen as a development of the (box-type) camera obscura device.

The 17th century [[Dutch Masters]], such as [[Johannes Vermeer]], were known for their magnificent attention to detail. It has been widely speculated that they made use of camerae obscurae, but the extent of their use by artists at this period remains a matter of considerable controversy, recently revived by the [[Hockney–Falco thesis]].&lt;ref name=Snyder/&gt;

[[File:1676 Johann Sturm - Camerae Obscurae Portatilis.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a portable camera obscura device from Johann Sturm's ''Collegium experimentale, sive curiosum'' (1676)]]
German philosopher [[Johann Sturm]] published an illustrated article about the construction of a portable camera obscura box with a 45° mirror and an oiled paper screen in his book ''Collegium experimentale: sive curiosum'' (1676).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbMWAAAAQAAJ|title=Collegium experimentale, sive curiosum|first=Johann|last=Sturm|year=1676|language=Latin|pages=161–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Zahn]]'s ''Oculus Artificialis Teledioptricus Sive Telescopium'', published in 1685, contains many descriptions, diagrams, illustrations and sketches of both the camera obscura and the [[magic lantern]]. A hand-held device with a mirror reflex mechanism was first proposed by [[Johann Zahn]] in 1685, a design that would later be used in photographic cameras.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, pp. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientist Robert Hooke presented a paper in 1694 to the Royal Society, in which he described a portable camera obscura. It was a cone-shaped box which fit onto the head and shoulders of its user.&lt;ref&gt;Wenczel, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the 18th century craftsmen and opticians would make camera obscura devices in the shape of books, which were much appreciated by lovers of optical devices.&lt;ref name=Mannoni1 /&gt;

One chapter in the Conte [[Francesco Algarotti|Algarotti's]] ''Saggio sopra Pittura'' (1764) is dedicated to the use of a camera ottica ("optic chamber") in painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Francesco| last= Algarotti | year=1764 | title= ''Saggio sopra la pittura'' | chapter= | editor= Presso Marco Coltellini, Livorno| others= | pages= 59–63 | id= | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SNY9AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | authorlink= | publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 18th century, following developments by [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Robert Hooke]], more easily portable models in boxes became available. These were extensively used by amateur artists while on their travels, but they were also employed by professionals, including [[Paul Sandby]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]], whose camera (disguised as a book) is now in the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum in London]]. Such cameras were later adapted by [[Joseph Nicephore Niepce]], [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[William Fox Talbot]] for creating the first photographs.

While the technical principles of the camera obscura have been known since antiquity, the broad use of the technical concept in producing images with a [[linear perspective]] in paintings, maps, theatre setups and architectural and later photographic images and movies started in the Western Renaissance and the scientific revolution. While e.g. [[Alhazen]] (Ibn al-Haytham) had already observed an optical effect and developed a state of the art theory of the refraction of light, he was less interested to produce images with it (compare [[Hans Belting]] 2005); the society he lived in was even hostile (compare [[Aniconism in Islam]]) towards personal images.&lt;ref name=belt&gt;Hans Belting Das echte Bild.

[[Image:Paper-cut.jpg|thumb|A Paper cut "window flower" during [[Chinese New Year]]]]

The art of paper cutting (''jiǎnzhǐ'' 剪纸) in China may date back to the second century a.c., since [[paper]] was invented by [[Cai Lun]] in the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] in [[China]]. As paper became more affordable, paper-cutting became one of the most important types of Chinese folk art. Later, this art form spread to other parts of the world, with different regions adopting their own cultural styles.  Because the cut-outs are often used to decorate doors and windows, they are sometimes referred to as '''chuāng huā''' (窗花), '''window flowers''' or '''window paper-cuts'''. People glued the papercuts to the exterior of windows, so the light from the inside would shine through the negative space of the cutout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CROSS-CULTURAL EXPERIENCES THROUGH AN EXHIBITION IN CHINA AND SWITZERLAND: "THE ART OF PAPER-CUTTING: EAST MEETS WEST"|jstor=23208592|journal=Source: Notes in the History of Art|date=2012-04-01|pages=29–35|volume=31|issue=3|first=Crystal Hui-Shu|last=Yang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the artworks are made of red paper, as red is associated with festivities and happiness in Chinese culture, but other colours were also used. Normally paper-cutting artwork is used on festivals like [[Chinese New Year|Spring Festival]], weddings and childbirth. Papercuts always symbolize luck and happiness.

==Origin==
Chinese paper-cutting originated from ancient activities of worshipping ancestors and gods, and is a traditional part of Chinese culture. According to archaeological records, it originates from the 6th century, although some believe that its history could be traced as far back as the [[Warring States period]] (around 3 BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/subview/25552/7526411.htm?fr=aladdin|title=中国剪纸|accessdate=2017-06-09|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; long before the paper was invented. At that time, people used other thin materials, like leaves, [[silver foil]], [[silk]] and even [[leather]], to carve hollowed patterns. Later, when paper was invented, people realized that this material was easy to cut, store and discard, and paper became the major material for this type of artwork. During the [[Ming]] and [[Qing]] dynasties (1368–1912), this artistry witnessed its most prosperous period. For over a thousand years, people (mainly women) have been making paper-cuts as part a leisure activity. They created different type of paper-cutting and shared and passed this traditional craftsmanship to their children, so that this traditional art style became more and more popular and is still practiced to this day.

Paper is a kind of material which [[mildew]]s and rots easily. In the southeast of China, it usually rains in May and June, which makes paper mildew and rot quickly. As a result, people in southeast did not keep them, and it is hard to find paper-cutting from that time. On the contrast, the weather in the northwest of China is usually dry, which makes it possible to find paper-cutting made in the [[Northern dynasties]] in [[Turpan]], [[Sinkiang]] province.

When paper-cutting passed down to the [[Tang dynasty]], the skills of handcraft became mature. Paper-cutting was not only a kind of handcraft, but also a piece of artwork, as it could express the idea through the pattern. In Ming and Qing dynasty, paper-cutting experienced its peak development. Folk paper-cutting spread to a wider range and had abundant means of artistic expression. Paper-cutting was used to decorate doors, windows and walls to show happiness and festival.

==Classification==
Paper-cutting is one of the oldest and the most popular [[folk art]]s in China. It can be geographically divided into a southern and a northern style. The southern style, represented by works from [[Yangzhou]] in [[Jiangsu Province]] and [[Leqing]] in [[Zhejiang Province]], features ingenious and beautiful designs, exquisite carving and interesting shapes. The northern style, mainly from [[Yu County, Hebei|Yuxian]] and [[Fengning]] in [[Hebei Province]] and best represented by works from northern [[Shaanxi]], features exaggerated shapes, vigorousness, vivid depictions and diverse patterns.

The style of window paper-cuts is usually free, except the flower pattern on the corner. The theme of window paper-cuts has a wide range, the most popular of which is based on the stories of traditional [[Chinese opera]]. As most buyers are farmers, the content of window paper-cut usually describe farming, spinning, fishing and poultry farming.

==Symmetry==
[[Image:TibetanDance.png|thumb|right|200px|A Symmetrical cut]]
There are basic cut-outs, consisting of a single image, and symmetrical designs, that are usually created by some folding over a proportioned crease, and then cutting a shape, so that when unfolded, it forms a symmetrical design. Chinese paper cuttings are usually symmetrical. The paper cut outs are usually in an even number series of 2, 4, 24 etc.

==Uses==
Today, paper cuttings are chiefly decorative. They liven up walls, windows, doors, columns, mirrors, lamps and lanterns in homes and are also used on presents or are given as gifts themselves. Paper cut-outs pasted on or near entrances are supposed to bring good luck. Paper cuttings used to be used as patterns, especially for [[embroidery]]  and [[lacquer]] work. Papercuts are used by younger generation as a decoration for their kits and books.

Paper-cutting was and is mostly used as a decoration, or an aesthetic way to express people's hopes, gratitude and other emotions. With a pair of scissors cutting through a piece of red paper, the paper-cuttings are endowed with a simple but exaggerated beauty. The vividly depicted paper-cuttings have different meanings. Some express the wish for a harvest or a wealthy life, such as paper-cuttings of a golden harvest, thriving domestic animals, good fortunes, a surplus year or a carp jumping over a dragon gate (a traditional Chinese story, indicating a leap towards a better life); some depict animals and plants, such as paper-cuttings of polecats, lions, kylins (Chinese mythical creature), jade rabbits (animal from a Chinese legend), pomegranates and peonies; some illustrate legendary figures or scenes from traditional myths or stories, such as paper-cuttings of the Yellow Emperor, the meeting of Niulang and Zhinv and 24 stories of filial piety; and others show people's gratitude towards life, such as paper-cuttings of a doll with two twisted hair on each side of the head, fish swimming through lotus and dishes. (a strong passion for life can be easily seen from the paper-cuttings of the women)

The most famous paper-cutting characters in Chinese are “福” (''fú'', meaning 'lucky') and “囍” (xǐ, meaning 'double happiness'). Even to this day, Chinese people love to hang paper-cutting of these two characters at their doors. “福” is usually used during the Chinese New Year's Festival, indicating people's wishes for a lucky year. “囍” can often be seen at the windows or door of newly-weds.

Window paper-cuts have a close relationship with Spring begins, as it has been a way to welcome spring since ancient times in China. In many areas in China, especially in North, when spring comes, people like to paste window paper-cuts on the window to express their happiness. Since Song and [[Yuan Dynasty]], people change the time to the Spring Festival in order to welcome Chinese New Year. Through pasting window paper-cuts, people decorate their home to show their joy, happiness and good intentions.

==Process==
There are two methods of manufacture: one uses scissors, the other uses knives. In the scissor method, several pieces of paper&amp;nbsp;— up to eight&amp;nbsp;— are fastened together. The motif is then cut with sharp, pointed scissors.

Knife cuttings are fashioned by putting several layers of paper on a relatively soft foundation consisting of a mixture of [[tallow]] and ashes. Following a pattern, the artist cuts the motif into the paper with a sharp knife which is usually held vertically. Skilled crafters can even cut out different drawings freely without stopping.

[[history of art|Art historians]] and [[philosophy of art|philosophers of art]] have long had '''classificatory disputes about art''' regarding whether a particular cultural form or piece of work should be classified as [[art]]. Disputes about what does and does not count as art continue to occur today.&lt;ref&gt;Semiotics of the Media By [[Winfried Nöth]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2Zk_Meiva7MC&amp;pg=PA621&amp;lpg=PA621&amp;dq=%22fine+art%22+%22art+objects%22+semiotics&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Syp47RdWZg&amp;sig=D-Tio3vfK-UkLs2s2DJzHHGCoDk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions of art==
[[File:Wanluan Thatched Hall by Dong Qichang.jpg|thumb|230px|left|[[Dong Qichang]], ''Landscape'' 1597. Dong Qichang was a high-ranking [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] civil servant, painting imaginary landscapes in the Chinese tradition of [[literati painting]], with collector's seals and poems.]]
Defining art can be difficult. [[Aesthetics|Aestheticians]] and art philosophers often engage in disputes about how to define art. By its original and broadest definition, '''''art''''' (from the [[Latin]] ''ars'', meaning "skill" or "[[craft]]") is the product or process of the effective application of a body of knowledge, most often using a set of skills; this meaning is preserved in such phrases as "[[liberal arts]]" and "[[martial arts]]". However, in the modern use of the word, which rose to prominence after 1750, “art” is commonly understood to be skill used to produce an [[aesthetic]] result (Hatcher, 1999).

Britannica Online defines it as "the use of skill or imagination in the creation of aesthetic objects, environments, or experiences that can be shared with others".&lt;ref&gt;Britannica Online&lt;/ref&gt; But how best to define the term “art” today is a subject of much contention; many books and journal articles have been published arguing over even the basics of what we mean by the term “art” (Davies, 1991 and Carroll, 2000). [[Theodor Adorno]] claimed in 1969 “It is self-evident that nothing concerning art is self-evident any more.” It is not clear who has the right to define art. Artists, philosophers, anthropologists, and psychologists all use the notion of art in their respective fields, and give it operational definitions that are not very similar to each other's.

The second, more narrow, more recent sense of the word “art” is roughly as an abbreviation for '''''creative art''''' or “[[fine art]].” Here we mean that skill is being used to express the artist’s creativity, or to engage the audience’s aesthetic sensibilities. Often, if the skill is being used to create objects with a practical use, rather than paintings or sculpture with no practical function other than as an [[Work of art|artwork]], it will be considered it as falling under classifications such as the [[decorative arts]], [[applied art]] and [[craft]] rather than fine art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it will be considered [[design]] instead of art. Some thinkers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference (Novitz, 1992). The modern distinction does not work well for older periods, such as [[medieval art]], where the most highly regarded art media at the time were often [[metalwork]], [[engraved gems]], [[textiles]] and other "applied arts", and the perceived value of artworks often reflected the cost of the materials and sheer amount of time spent creating the work at least as much as the creative input of the artist.

==Theories of art classification==
===Historical systematic classifications===
In the [[Zhou dynasty]] of ancient China, excellence in the ''liù yì'' (六藝), or "[[Six Arts]]", was expected of the ''junzi'' (君子), or "perfect gentleman", as defined by philosophers like [[Confucius]]. Because these arts spanned both the [[Civil service#China|civil]] and [[Military history of China before 1911|military]] aspects of life, excelling in all six required a scholar to be very well-rounded and [[polymath]]ic. The Six Arts were as follows:

* [[Confucianism#Rite and centring|Rites]] (禮)
* [[Music of China|Music]] (樂)
* [[Archery]] (射)
* [[Chariot]]eering and [[equestrianism]] (御)
* [[Chinese calligraphy|Calligraphy]] (書)
* [[Chinese mathematics|Mathematics]] (數) 

Later in the history of imperial China, the Six Arts were pared down, creating a similar system of [[Four Arts]] for the [[scholar-official]] [[caste]] to learn and follow:

* ''[[Guqin|Qín]]'' (琴), an instrument representing music
* ''[[Go (game)|Qí]]'' (棋), a board game representing military strategy
* ''Shū'' (書), or [[Chinese calligraphy]], representing literacy
* ''Huà'' (畫), or [[Chinese painting]], representing the visual arts

Another attempt to systematically define art as a grouping of disciplines in antiquity is represented by the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Muses]]. Each of the standard nine Muses symbolized and embodied one of nine branches of what the Greeks called ''[[techne]]'', a term which roughly means "art" but has also been translated as "craft" or "craftsmanship", and the definition of the word also included more scientific disciplines. These nine traditional branches were:
* [[Epic poetry]], embodied by [[Calliope]]
* [[History]], embodied by [[Clio]]
* [[Music]] and [[lyric poetry]], embodied by [[Euterpe]]
* [[Love poetry]], embodied by [[Erato]]
* [[Tragedy]], embodied by [[Melpomene]]
* [[Hymns]] and [[pantomime]], embodied by [[Polyhymnia]]
* [[Dance]] and [[Greek chorus|chorus]], embodied by [[Terpsichore]]
* [[Comedy]] and [[idyll|idyllic poetry]], embodied by [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]]
* [[Astronomy]], embodied by [[Urania]]

In [[Christendom#Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages|medieval Christian Europe]], [[Medieval university|universities]] taught a standard set of seven [[liberal arts]], defined by early medieval philosophers such as [[Boethius]] and [[Alcuin|Alcuin of York]] and as such centered around philosophy. The definitions of these subjects and their practice was heavily based on the educational system of Greece and Rome. These seven arts were themselves split into two categories:
* the [[Trivium]], considered the foundation of knowledge, and comprising the three basic elements of philosophy: [[grammar]], [[logic]], and [[rhetoric]];
* and the [[Quadrivium]], comprising [[music]], [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]] and [[astronomy]].

At this time, and continuing after the [[Renaissance]], the word "art" in English and its cognates in other languages had not yet attained their modern meaning. One of the first philosophers to discuss art in the framework we understand today was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], who described in his ''[[Lectures on Aesthetics]]'' a ranking of the five major arts from most material to most expressive:
#[[architecture]]
#[[sculpture]]
#[[painting]]
#[[music]]
#[[poetry]]

Hegel's listing of the arts caught on particularly in France, and with continual modifications the list has remained relevant and a subject of debate in French culture into the 21st century. This classification was popularized by [[Ricciotto Canudo]], an early scholar of film who wrote "Manifesto of the Seventh Art" in 1923. The epithets given to each discipline by its placement of the list are often used to refer to them through paraphrase, particularly with calling film "the seventh art". The French [[Ministry of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] often participates in the decision making for defining a "new" art.&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, Thomas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/06/business/worldbusiness/06game.html "For France, Video Games Are as Artful as Cinema"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The ten arts are generally given as follows:
#''le premier art:'' [[architecture]]
#''le deuxième art:'' [[sculpture]]
#''le troisième art:'' [[painting]]
#''le quatrième art:'' [[music]]
#''le cinquième art:'' [[literature]], including [[poetry]] and [[prose]]
#''le sixième art:'' the [[performing arts]], including [[dance]] and [[theatre]]
#''le septième art:'' film and cinema
#''le huitième art: "les arts médiatiques",'' including [[radio]], [[television]], and [[photography]]
#''le neuvième art:'' [[comics]]
#''le dixième art:'' [[video games]], or digital art forms more generally&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090106154034/http://big-presse.com/big-article-Art-1707.php "Connaissez-vous le 10eme art ? L'art numérique."], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ongoing dispute over what should constitute the next form of art has been fought for over a century. Currently, there are a variety of contenders for ''le onzième art'', many of which are older disciplines whose practitioners feel that their medium is underappreciated as art. One particularly popular contender for the 11th is [[multimedia]], which is intended to bring together the ten arts just as Canudo argued that cinema was the culmination of the first six arts. [[Performance art]], as separate from the performing arts, has been called ''le douzième'', or "twelfth", art.&lt;ref&gt;Mas, Jean. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MreyR7VhSh0 ''Manifeste de la Performance''], AICA-France/Villa Arson, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalized definitions of art===
The traditional Western classifications since the Renaissance have been variants of the [[hierarchy of genres]] based on the degree to which the work displays the imaginative input of the artist, using artistic theory that goes back to the ancient world. Such thinking received something of a boost with the [[aesthetics]] of [[Romanticism]]. A similar theoretical framework applied in traditional [[Chinese art]]; for example in both the Western and Far Eastern traditions of [[landscape painting]] (see [[literati painting]]), ''imaginary'' landscapes were accorded a higher status than realistic depictions of an actual landscape view - in the West relegated to "[[topographical view]]s".

Many have argued that it is a mistake to even try to define art or beauty, that they have no essence, and so can have no definition. Often, it is said that art is a cluster of related concepts rather than a single concept. Examples of this approach include Morris Weitz and Berys Gaut.

[[Image:Andy Warhol 1977.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andy Warhol]] exhibited wooden sculptures of [[Brillo|Brillo Boxes]] as art.]]
Another approach is to say that “art” is basically a sociological category, that whatever art schools and museums, and artists get away with is considered art regardless of formal definitions. This [[institutional theory of art]] has been championed by [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]]. Most people did not consider a store-bought [[urinal (restroom)|urinal]] or a sculptural depiction of a [[Brillo|Brillo Box]] to be art until [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Andy Warhol]] (respectively) placed them in the context of art (i.e., the [[art gallery]]), which then provided the association of these objects with the values that define art.

Proceduralists often suggest that it is the process by which a work of art is created or viewed that makes it, art, not any inherent feature of an object, or how well received it is by the institutions of the art world after its introduction to society at large. For [[John Dewey]], for instance, if the writer intended a piece to be a poem, it is one whether other poets acknowledge it or not. Whereas if exactly the same set of words was written by a journalist, intending them as shorthand notes to help him write a longer article later, these would not be a poem.

[[Leo Tolstoy]], on the other hand, claims that what makes something art or not is how it is experienced by its audience, not by the intention of its creator.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Functionalists, like [[Monroe Beardsley]] argue that whether a piece counts as art depends on what function it plays in a particular context. For instance, the same Greek vase may play a non-artistic function in one context (carrying wine), and an artistic function in another context (helping us to appreciate the beauty of the human figure).

==Disputes about classifying art==
Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreements about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem, rather that “the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life” are “so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art” (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about our values and where we are trying to go with our society than they are about theory proper. For example, when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' criticized [[Damien Hirst]] and [[Tracey Emin]]’s work by arguing "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst’s and Emin’s work.

On the other hand, [[Thierry de Duve]]&lt;ref&gt;Thierry de Duve, ''Kant After Duchamp''. 1996&lt;/ref&gt; argues that disputes about the definition of art are a necessary consequence of [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s presentation of a [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] as a work of art. In his 1996 book ''Kant After Duchamp'' he reinterprets Kant's ''[[Critique of Judgement]]'' exchanging the phrase "this is beautiful" with "this is art", using Kantian aesthetics to address post-Duchampian art.

===Conceptual art===
{{main article|Conceptual art}}

The work of the French artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] from the 1910s and 1920s paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works (the [[readymade]]s, for instance) that defied previous categorisations. Conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s. The first wave of the "conceptual art" movement extended from approximately 1967 to 1978. Early "concept" artists like [[Henry Flynt]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]] and [[Ray Johnson]] influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual artists like [[Dan Graham]], [[Hans Haacke]], and [[Douglas Huebler]].

More recently, the “[[Young British Artists]]” (YBAs), led by [[Damien Hirst]], came to prominence in the 1990s and their work is seen as conceptual, even though it relies very heavily on the art object to make its impact. The term is used in relation to them on the basis that the object is not the artwork, or is often a [[Found art|found object]], which has not needed artistic skill in its production. [[Tracey Emin]] is seen as a leading YBA and a conceptual artist, even though she has denied that she is and has emphasised personal emotional expression.

====Recent examples of disputed conceptual art====
1991: [[Charles Saatchi]] funds Damien Hirst and the next year in the [[Saatchi Gallery]] exhibits his ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine.

1993: [[Vanessa Beecroft]] holds her first performance in Milan, Italy, using young girls to act as a second audience to the display of her diary of food.

1999: [[Tracey Emin]] is nominated for the [[Turner Prize]]. Part of her exhibit is ''My Bed'', her dishevelled bed, surrounded by detritus such as condoms, blood-stained knickers, bottles and her bedroom slippers.

2001: [[Martin Creed]] wins the Turner Prize for ''The Lights Going On and Off'', an empty room where the lights go on and off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1698032.stm BBC Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

2002: [[Miltos Manetas]] confronts the Whitney Biennial with his Whitneybiennial.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDB1F31F937A35750C0A9649C8B63 | work=The New York Times | first=Matthew | last=Mirapaul | title=ARTS ONLINE; If You Can't Join 'Em, You Can Always Tweak 'Em | date=4 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2005: [[Simon Starling]] wins the Turner Prize for ''Shedboatshed'', a wooden shed which he had turned into a boat, floated down the Rhine and turned back into a shed again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1905555,00.html ''The Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy in the UK====
[[Image:Stuckist International Gallery 2003 (shark 1).jpg|thumb|''A Dead Shark Isn't Art'', [[Stuckism International Gallery]], 2003]]
The [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] group of artists, founded in 1999, proclaimed themselves "pro-contemporary figurative painting with ideas and anti-conceptual art, mainly because of its lack of concepts." They also called it pretentious, "unremarkable and boring" and on July 25, 2002, in a [[Stuckist demonstrations|demonstration]], deposited a coffin outside the [[White Cube]] gallery, marked "The Death of Conceptual Art".&lt;ref&gt;Cripps, Charlotte. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040907/ai_n12797891 "Visual arts: Saying knickers to Sir Nicholas], ''[[The Independent]]'', 7 September 2004.

Retrieved 25 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the [[Stuckism International Gallery]] exhibited a preserved shark under the title ''A Dead Shark Isn't Art'', clearly referencing the Damien Hirst work (see disputes above).&lt;ref&gt;Alberge, Dalya.

In a BBC2 ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme on 19 October 1999 hosted by [[Jeremy Paxman]] with Charles Thomson attacking that year's Turner Prize and artist [[Brad Lochore]] defending it, Thomson was displaying Stuckist paintings, while Lochore had brought along a plastic detergent bottle on a cardboard plinth. At one stage Lochore states, "if people say it's art, it's art". Paxman asks, "So you can say anything is art?" and Lochore replies, "You could say everything is art..." At this point Thomson, off-screen, can be heard to say, "Is my shoe art?" while at the same time his shoe appears in front of Lochore, who observes, "If you say it is. I have to judge it on those terms." Thomson's response is, "I've never heard anything so ludicrous in my life before."&lt;ref&gt;Milner, Frank, ed. ''[[The Stuckists Punk Victorian]]'', pp.32-48, [[National Museums Liverpool]] 2004, {{ISBN|1-902700-27-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Ivan Massow]], the Chairman of the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] branded conceptual art "pretentious, self-indulgent, craftless tat" and in "danger of disappearing up its own arse ... led by cultural tsars such as the [[Tate Gallery|Tate]]'s Sir [[Nicholas Serota]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,634797,00.html ''The Guardian'']&lt;/ref&gt; Massow was consequently forced to resign. At the end of the year, the Culture Minister, [[Kim Howells]], an art school graduate, denounced the Turner Prize as "cold, mechanical, conceptual bullshit".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3585205/The-entries-are-tat.-Theyre-made-badly.-Theyre-just-very-boring-and-very-thin.html ''The Daily Telegraph'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, the [[Saatchi Gallery]] told the media that "painting continues to be the most relevant and vital way that artists choose to communicate."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Nigel 2004 [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1473165/Saatchi%27s-latest-shock-for-the-art-world-is---painting.html "Saatchi's latest shock for the art world is &amp;ndash; painting"] ''The Daily Telegraph'' 10 February 2004. Accessed April 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, [[Charles Saatchi]] began to sell prominent works from his YBA ([[Young British Artists]]) collection.

===Computer and video games===
{{main article|Video games as an art form}}
Computer games date back as far as 1947, although they did not reach much of an audience until the 1970s. It would be difficult and odd to deny that computer and video games include many kinds of art (bearing in mind, of course, that the concept "art" itself is, as indicated, open to a variety of definitions). The graphics of a video game constitute [[digital art]], [[graphic art]], and probably [[video art]]; the original soundtrack of a video game clearly constitutes [[music]]. However it is a point of debate whether the video game as a whole should be considered a piece of art of some kind, perhaps a form of [[interactive art]].

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]], for example, has gone on record claiming that video games are not art, and for structural reasons will always be inferior to cinema, but then, he admits his lack of knowledge in the area when he affirmed that he "will never play a game when there is a good book to be read or a good movie to be watched.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN&amp;date=20051127 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |title=Why did the chicken cross the genders? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619125645/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=answerman&amp;date=20051127 |archivedate=2010-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Video game designer [[Hideo Kojima]] has argued that playing a videogame is not art, but games do have artistic style and incorporate art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2006 |title= Official PlayStation Magazine (US) |journal= |volume= Feb 2006 |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/150043/kojima-says-games-are-not-art |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017050011/http://kotaku.com/150043/kojima-says-games-are-not-art |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120723020624/http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=6350406 A videogame is not art!]&lt;/ref&gt; Video game designer Chris Crawford argues that video games are art.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Crawford, ''The Art of Computer Game Design'' 1982 mirrored with permission at [http://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/fac/peabody/game-book/Coverpage.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Esquire columnist Chuck Klosterman also argues that video games are art.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Klosterman “The Lester Bangs of Video Games” ''Esquire'' July 2006 at [http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a797/esq0706kloster-66/]&lt;/ref&gt; Tadhg Kelly argues that play itself is not art and that fun is a constant required for all games &lt;ref&gt;[http://whatgamesare.com/2011/09/fun-simple-to-explain-hard-to-accept.html Tadhg Kelly, ''Fun: Simple to Explain, Hard to Accept'', 2011, at]&lt;/ref&gt; so the art in games is the art of location and place rather than interaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whatgamesare.com/2011/11/living-galleries-games-are-art.html Tadhg Kelly, ''Living Galleries'', 2011 at]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Color motion picture film''' refers both to unexposed [[color photography|color photographic film]] in a format suitable for use in a [[Movie camera|motion picture camera]], and to finished motion picture [[film]], ready for use in a [[movie projector|projector]], which bears images in color.

The first color cinematography was by [[additive color]] systems such as the one patented by [[Edward Raymond Turner]] in 1899 and tested in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19598445 "Martin Scorsese on world's first colour film discovery"]. BBC&lt;/ref&gt; A simplified additive system was successfully commercialised in 1909 as [[Kinemacolor]]. These early systems used black-and-white film to photograph and project two or more component images through different color [[filter (optics)|filters]].

Around 1920, the first practical [[subtractive color]] processes were introduced. These also used black-and-white film to photograph multiple color-filtered source images, but the final product was a multicolored print that did not require special projection equipment. Before 1932, when three-strip [[Technicolor]] was introduced, commercialized subtractive processes used only two color components and could reproduce only a limited range of color.

In 1935, [[Kodachrome]] was introduced, followed by [[Agfacolor]] in 1936. They were intended primarily for amateur [[home movies]] and "[[Reversal film|slides]]". These were the first films of the "integral tripack" type, coated with three layers of differently color-sensitive [[Photographic emulsion|emulsion]], which is usually what is meant by the words "color film" as commonly used. The few color films still being made in the 2010s are of this type. The first color [[negative (photography)|negative]] films and corresponding [[release print|print]] films were modified versions of these films. They were introduced around 1940 but only came into wide use for commercial motion picture production in the early 1950s. In the US, [[Eastman Kodak]]'s [[Eastmancolor]] was the usual choice, but it was often re-branded with another trade name, such as "WarnerColor", by the studio or the film processor.

Later color films were standardized into two distinct processes: [[Eastman Color Negative|Eastman Color Negative 2]] chemistry (camera negative stocks, duplicating interpositive and internegative stocks) and [[Eastman Color Positive|Eastman Color Positive 2]] chemistry (positive prints for direct projection), usually abbreviated as ECN-2 and ECP-2. Fuji's products are compatible with ECN-2 and ECP-2.

Film was the dominant form of cinematography until the 2010s, when it was largely replaced by [[digital cinematography]].&lt;ref name="indiewire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/as-studios-abandon-35-mm-film-small-theaters-struggle-to-transition-to-digital|title=Studios Abandon Film, Small Theaters Struggle -- And There's a Happy Ending|website=Indiewire|last1=Hurley|first1=Michael|date=2 January 2014|access-date=5 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201064107/http://www.indiewire.com/article/as-studios-abandon-35-mm-film-small-theaters-struggle-to-transition-to-digital|archive-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The first motion pictures were photographed using a simple homogeneous [[photographic emulsion]] that yielded a [[black-and-white]] image—that is, an image in shades of gray, ranging from black to white, corresponding to the [[luminous intensity]] of each point on the photographed subject. Light, shade, form and movement were captured, but not color.

With color motion picture film, information about the [[color]] of the light at each image point is also captured. This is done by analyzing the [[visible spectrum]] of color into several regions (normally three, commonly referred to by their dominant colors: red, green and blue) and recording each region separately.

Current color films do this with three layers of differently color-sensitive photographic emulsion coated on one strip of [[film base]]. Early processes used color [[filter (optics)|filters]] to photograph the color components as completely separate images (e.g., three-strip [[Technicolor]]) or adjacent microscopic image fragments (e.g., [[Dufaycolor]]) in a one-layer black-and-white emulsion.

Each photographed color component, initially just a colorless record of the luminous intensities in the part of the spectrum that it captured, is processed to produce a transparent dye image in the color [[complementary color|complementary]] to the color of the light that it recorded. The superimposed dye images combine to synthesize the original colors by the [[subtractive color]] method. In some early color processes (e.g., [[Kinemacolor]]), the component images remained in black-and-white form and were projected through [[color filter]]s to synthesize the original colors by the [[additive color]] method.

==Tinting and hand coloring==
{{see also|List of early color feature films}}
The earliest motion picture stocks were [[orthochromatic]], and recorded blue and green light, but not red. Recording all three spectral regions required making film stock [[panchromatic]] to some degree. Since orthochromatic film stock hindered color photography in its beginnings, the first films with color in them used [[aniline]] dyes to create artificial color. Hand-colored films appeared in 1895 with [[Thomas Edison]]'s hand-painted ''Annabelle's Dance'' for his [[Kinetoscope]] viewers.

Many early filmmakers from the first ten years of film also used this method to some degree. [[George Méliès]] offered hand-painted prints of his own films at an additional cost over the black-and-white versions, including the visual-effects pioneering ''[[Le Voyage dans la Lune|A Trip to the Moon]]'' (1902). The film had various parts of the film painted frame-by-frame by twenty-one women in Montreuil&lt;ref name="history"&gt;David A. Cook, ''A History of Narrative Film'' (2nd edition, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1990).  {{ISBN|0-393-95553-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a production-line method.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;Ira Konigsberg, ''The Complete Film Dictionary'' Meridan PAL Books, 1987)  {{ISBN|0-452-00980-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially successful [[stencil]] color process was introduced in 1905 by [[Pathé Frères]]. ''Pathé Color'', renamed [[Pathéchrome]] in 1929, became one of the most accurate and reliable stencil coloring systems. It incorporated an original print of a film with sections cut by [[pantograph]] in the appropriate areas for up to six colors&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; by a coloring machine with dye-soaked, velvet rollers.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Ephraim Katz, ''The Film Encyclopedia'' (HarperCollins, 1994) {{ISBN|0-06-273089-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a stencil had been made for the whole film, it was placed into contact with the print to be colored and run at high speed (60 feet per minute) through the coloring (staining) machine. The process was repeated for each set of stencils corresponding to a different color. By 1910, Pathé had over 400 women employed as stencilers in their [[Vincennes]] factory.  Pathéchrome continued production through the 1930s.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

A more common technique emerged in the early 1910s known as '''[[film tinting]]''', a process in which either the emulsion or the [[film base]] is dyed, giving the image a uniform [[monochromatic]] color.  This process was popular during the silent era, with specific colors employed for certain narrative effects (red for scenes with fire or firelight, blue for night, etc.).&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

A complementary process, called '''toning''', replaces the [[silver]] particles in the film with metallic salts or [[mordant]]ed [[dye]]s.  This creates a color effect in which the dark parts of the image are replaced with a color (e.g., blue and white rather than black and white).  Tinting and toning were sometimes applied together.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

In the United States, St. Louis engraver Max Handschiegl and cinematographer Alvin Wyckoff created the [[Handschiegl Color Process]], a dye-transfer equivalent of the stencil process, first used in ''[[Joan the Woman]]'' (1917) directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]], and used in special effects sequences for films such as ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925).&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

[[Eastman Kodak]] introduced its own system of pre-tinted black-and-white film stocks called [[Sonochrome]] in 1929.  The Sonochrome line featured films tinted in seventeen different colors including Peachblow, Inferno, Candle Flame, Sunshine, Purple Haze, Firelight, Azure, Nocturne, Verdante, Aquagreen,&lt;ref name="readfilm" /&gt; Caprice, Fleur de Lis, Rose Doree, and the neutral-density Argent, which kept the screen from becoming excessively bright when switching to a black-and-white scene.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Tinting and toning continued to be used well into the sound era.  In the 1930s and 1940s, some western films were processed in a sepia-toning solution to evoke the feeling of old photographs of the day. Tinting was used as late as 1951 for [[Sam Newfield]]'s sci-fi film ''[[Lost Continent (1951 film)|Lost Continent]]'' for the green lost-world sequences. [[Alfred Hitchcock]] used a form of hand-coloring for the orange-red gun-blast at the audience in ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945).&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  Kodak's Sonochrome and similar pre-tinted stocks were still in production until the 1970s and were used commonly for custom theatrical trailers and [[Snipe (theatrical)|snipes]].

In the last half of the 20th century, [[Norman McLaren]], who was one of the pioneers in animated movies, made several animated films in which he directly hand-painted the images, and in some cases, also the soundtrack, on each frame of the film. This approach was previously employed in the early years of movies, late 19th and early 20th century. One of the precursors in color hand painting frame by frame was the Aragonese Segundo de Chomon, that worked with Melies.

Tinting was gradually replaced by natural color techniques.

==Physics of light and color==
The principles on which [[color photography]] is based were first proposed by Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1855 and presented at the [[Royal Society]] in London in 1861.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  By that time, it was known that [[light]] comprises a spectrum of different wavelengths that are perceived as different colors as they are absorbed and reflected by natural objects.  Maxwell discovered that all natural colors in this spectrum as perceived by the human eye may be reproduced with additive combinations of three [[primary color]]s—[[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]]—which, when mixed equally, produce white light.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Between 1900 and 1935, dozens of natural color systems were introduced, although only a few were successful.&lt;ref name="readfilm"&gt;Monaco, James (1981) (Revised ed) ''How to Read a Film'' Oxford University Press.  {{ISBN|0-19-502806-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additive color===
The first color systems that appeared in motion pictures were [[additive color]] systems.  Additive color was practical because no special color stock was necessary.  Black-and-white film could be processed and used in both filming and projection.  The various additive systems entailed the use of color [[filter (photography)|filters]] on both the movie camera and [[movie projector|projector]].  Additive color adds lights of the primary colors in various proportions to the projected image.  Because of the limited amount of space to record images on film, and later because the lack of a camera that could record more than two strips of film at once, most early motion-picture color systems consisted of two colors, often red and green or red and blue.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

A pioneering three-color additive system was patented in England by [[Edward Raymond Turner]] in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World's first colour moving pictures discovered|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19423951l|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used a rotating set of red, green and blue filters to photograph the three color components one after the other on three successive [[film frame|frame]]s of [[panchromatic]] black-and-white film. The finished film was projected through similar filters to reconstitute the color. In 1902, Turner shot test footage to demonstrate his system, but projecting it proved problematic because of the accurate registration (alignment) of the three separate color elements required for acceptable results. Turner died a year later without having satisfactorily projected the footage. In 2012, curators at the [[National Media Museum]] in Bradford, UK, had the original custom-format [[nitrate film]] copied to black-and-white 35&amp;nbsp;mm film, which was then scanned into a digital video format by [[telecine]]. Finally, [[digital image processing]] was used to align and combine each group of three frames into one color image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brianpritchard.com/Lee_Turner_Project.htm Pritchard, B. (2012). "Lee-Turner Project with the National Media Museum".] Retrieved 20 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that the whole world can now view brief motion pictures from 1902 in full color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World's first colour film unveiled|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/9538882/Worlds-first-colour-film-unveiled.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Visit to the Seaside (1908).webm|thumb|''A Visit to the Seaside'', the first motion picture in Kinemacolor]]
[[File:The Delhi Durbar 1911.webm|thumb|''With Our King and Queen Through India'', extract]]
Practical color in the motion picture business began with [[Kinemacolor]], first demonstrated in 1906.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;  This was a two-color system created in England by [[George Albert Smith (inventor)|George Albert Smith]], and promoted by film pioneer [[Charles Urban]]'s The Charles Urban Trading Company in 1908.  It was used for a series of films including the documentary ''[[With Our King and Queen Through India]]'', depicting the [[Delhi Durbar]] (also known as ''The Durbar at Delhi'', 1912), which was filmed in December 1911. The Kinemacolor process consisted of alternating frames of specially sensitized black-and-white film exposed at 32 frames per second through a rotating filter with alternating red and green areas. The printed film was projected through similar alternating red and green filters at the same speed. A perceived range of colors resulted from the blending of the separate red and green alternating images by the viewer's persistence of vision.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1917) "Kinemacolor" ''How to Make and Operate Moving Pictures'' Funk &amp; Wagnalls. Courtesy of [http://www.widescreenmuseum.com Wide Screen Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Friese-Greene]] invented another additive color system called Biocolour, which was developed by his son [[Claude Friese-Greene]] after William's death in 1921.  William sued George Albert Smith, alleging that the Kinemacolor process infringed on the patents for his Bioschemes, Ltd.; as a result, Smith's patent was revoked in 1914.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  Both Kinemacolor and Biocolour had problems with "fringing" or "haloing" of the image, due to the separate red and green images not fully matching up.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

By their nature, these additive systems were very wasteful of light. Absorption by the color filters involved meant that only a minor fraction of the projection light actually reached the screen, resulting in an image that was dimmer than a typical black-and-white image. The larger the screen, the dimmer the picture. For this and other case-by-case reasons, the use of additive processes for theatrical motion pictures had been almost completely abandoned by the early 1940s, though additive color methods are employed by all the color [[video]] and computer display systems in common use today.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

===Subtractive color===
The first practical [[subtractive color]] process was introduced by Kodak as "Kodachrome", a name recycled twenty years later for a very different and far better-known product. Filter-photographed red and blue-green records were printed onto the front and back of one strip of black-and-white [[duplitized film]]. After development, the resulting silver images were bleached away and replaced with color dyes, red on one side and cyan on the other. The pairs of superimposed dye images reproduced a useful but limited range of color. Kodak's first narrative film with the process was a short subject entitled ''Concerning $1000'' (1916). Though their duplitized film provided the basis for several commercialized two-color printing processes, the image origination and color-toning methods constituting Kodak's own process were little-used.

The first truly successful subtractive color process was William van Doren Kelley's [[Prizma]],&lt;ref name="afipriz"&gt;Slide, Anthony. (1990) "Prizma Color" ''The American Film Industry: A Historical Dictionary'' Limelight p. 271. {{ISBN|0-87910-139-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; an early color process that was first introduced at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City on 8 February 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ra0eAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage Museum Notes], ''The American Museum Journal'' (1917), vol. 17, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell-Clyne, Adrian. (1951) ''Colour Cinematography'' Chapman and Hall press.&lt;/ref&gt; Prizma began in 1916 as an additive system similar to Kinemacolor.

However, after 1917, Kelley reinvented the process as a subtractive one with several years of short films and travelogues, such as ''Everywhere With Prizma'' (1919) and ''A Prizma Color Visit to Catalina'' (1919) before releasing features such as the documentary ''Bali the Unknown'' (1921), ''[[The Glorious Adventure (1922 film)|The Glorious Adventure]]'' (1922), and ''[[Venus of the South Seas]]'' (1924). A Prizma promotional short filmed for [[Del Monte Foods]] titled ''Sunshine Gatherers'' (1921) is available on DVD in Treasures 5 The West 1898–1938 by the National Film Preservation Foundation.

The invention of Prizma led to a series of similarly printed color processes.  This [[bipack color]] system used two strips of film running through the camera, one recording red, and one recording blue-green light. With the black-and-white negatives being printed onto duplitized film, the color images were then toned red and blue, effectively creating a subtractive color print.

[[Leon Forrest Douglass]] (1869–1940), a founder of [[Victor Records]], developed a system he called Naturalcolor, and first showed a short test film made in the process on 15 May 1917 at his home in [[San Rafael, California]].  The only feature film known to have been made in this process, ''[[Cupid Angling]]'' (1918) — starring [[Ruth Roland]] and with cameo appearances by [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks]] — was filmed in the Lake Lagunitas area of [[Marin County, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Gracyk, Tim. ''[http://www.gracyk.com/leon.shtml Leon F. Douglass: Inventor and Victor's First Vice-President]'' (Retrieved on 2007-03-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

After experimenting with additive systems (including a [[movie camera|camera]] with two [[apertures]], one with a red filter, one with a green filter) from 1915 to 1921, Dr. [[Herbert Kalmus]], Dr. Daniel Comstock, and mechanic W. Burton Wescott developed a [[subtractive color]] system for [[Technicolor]]. The system used a [[beam splitter]] in a specially modified camera to send red and green light to adjacent frames of one strip of black-and-white film. From this negative, skip-printing was used to print each color's frames contiguously onto film stock with half the normal base thickness. The two prints were chemically toned to roughly complementary hues of red and green,&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; then cemented together, back to back, into a single strip of film. The first film to use this process was ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'' ([[1922 in film|1922]]) starring [[Anna May Wong]]. Perhaps the most ambitious film to use it was ''[[The Black Pirate]]'' ([[1926 in film|1926]]), starring and produced by [[Douglas Fairbanks]].

The process was later refined through the incorporation of dye [[imbibition]], which allowed for the transferring of dyes from both color matrices into a single print, avoiding several problems that had become evident with the cemented prints and allowing multiple prints to be created from a single pair of matrices.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

Technicolor's system was very popular for a number of years, but it was a very expensive process: shooting cost three times that of black-and-white photography and printing costs were no cheaper. By 1932, color photography in general had nearly been abandoned by major studios, until Technicolor developed a new advancement to record all three primary colors. Utilizing a special [[dichroic]] [[beam splitter]] equipped with two 45-degree [[prism (optics)|prism]]s in the form of a cube, light from the lens was deflected by the prisms and split into two paths to expose each one of three black-and-white negatives (one each to record the densities for red, green, and blue).&lt;ref name="afitech"&gt;Slide, Anthony. (1990) "Technicolor" ''The American Film Industry: A Historical Dictionary'' Limelight pp. 338-340. {{ISBN|0-87910-139-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three negatives were then printed to gelatin matrices, which also completely bleached the image, washing out the silver and leaving only the gelatin record of the image. A receiver print, consisting of a 50% density print of the black-and-white negative for the green record strip, and including the soundtrack, was struck and treated with dye mordants to aid in the imbibition process (this "black" layer was discontinued in the early 1940s). The matrices for each strip were coated with their complementary dye (yellow, cyan, or magenta), and then each successively brought into high-pressure contact with the receiver, which imbibed and held the dyes, which collectively rendered a wider spectrum of color than previous technologies.&lt;ref name="awsm"&gt;Hart, Martin (2003). "[http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/oldcolor/technicolor6.htm The History of Technicolor]" Widescreenmuseum.com. Retrieved 2006-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The first animation film with the three-color (also called three-strip) system was [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'' ([[1932 in film|1932]]), the first short live-action film was ''La Cucaracha'' ([[1934 in film|1934]]), and the first feature was ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'' ([[1935 in film|1935]]).&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;

[[Gasparcolor]], a single-strip 3-color system, was developed in 1933 by the Hungarian chemist Dr. Bela Gaspar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oskarfischinger.org/GasparColor.htm|title=Gasparcolor: Perfect Hues for Animation|publisher=Fischinger Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real push for color films and the nearly immediate changeover from black-and-white production to nearly all color film were pushed forward by the prevalence of television in the early 1950s. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number rose to over 50 percent.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The rise in color films was also aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near monopoly on the medium.

In 1947, the United States Justice Department filed an antitrust suit against Technicolor for monopolization of color cinematography (even though rival processes such as [[Cinecolor]] and [[Trucolor]] were in general use). In 1950, a federal court ordered Technicolor to allot a number of its three-strip cameras for use by independent studios and filmmakers. Although this certainly affected Technicolor, its real undoing was the invention of [[Eastmancolor]] that same year.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

==Monopack color film==
[[Image:35mm-undevel.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A strip of undeveloped 35 mm color negative.]]

In the field of motion pictures, the many-layered type of color film normally called an ''integral tripack'' in broader contexts has long been known by the less tongue-twisting term ''monopack''. For many years, Monopack (capitalized) was a proprietary product of Technicolor Corp, whereas monopack (not capitalized) generically referred to any of several single-strip color film products, certainly including various Eastman Kodak products. It appears that Technicolor made no attempt to register Monopack as a trademark with the [[US Patent and Trademark Office]], although it certainly asserted that term as if it were a registered trademark, and it had the force of a legal agreement between it and Eastman Kodak to back up that assertion. It was a solely-sourced product, too, as Eastman Kodak was legally prevented from marketing any color motion picture film products wider than 16mm, 35mm specifically, until the expiration of the so-called "Monopack Agreement" in 1950. This, notwithstanding the facts that Technicolor never had the capability to manufacture sensitized motion picture films of any kind, nor single-strip color films based upon its so-called "Troland Patent" (which patent Technicolor maintained covered all monopack-type films in general, but monopack-type motion picture films in particular, and which Eastman Kodak elected not to contest as Technicolor was then one of its largest customers, if not its largest customer). After 1950, Eastman Kodak was free to make and market color films of any kind, particularly including monopack color motion picture films in 65/70mm, 35mm, 16mm and 8mm. The "Monopack Agreement" had no effect on color still films.

Monopack color films are based on the subtractive color system, which filters colors from white light by using superimposed cyan, magenta and yellow dye images. Those images are created from records of the amounts of red, green and blue light present at each point of the image formed by the camera lens. A subtractive primary color (cyan, magenta, yellow) is what remains when one of the additive primary colors (red, green, blue) has been removed from the spectrum. Eastman Kodak's monopack color films incorporated three separate layers of differently color sensitive emulsion into one strip of film. Each layer recorded one of the additive primaries and was processed to produce a dye image in the [[complementary color|complementary]] subtractive primary.

[[Kodachrome]] was the first commercially successful application of monopack multilayer film, introduced in 1935.&lt;ref name="explore"&gt;''Exploring the Color Image'' (1996) Eastman Kodak Publication H-188.&lt;/ref&gt; For professional motion picture photography, Kodachrome Commercial, on a 35mm [[Film perforations#BH|BH-perforated]] base, was available exclusively from Technicolor, as its so-called "Technicolor Monopack" product. Similarly, for sub-professional motion picture photography, Kodachrome Commercial, on a 16mm base, was available exclusively from Eastman Kodak. In both cases, Eastman Kodak was the sole manufacturer and the sole processor. In the 35mm case, Technicolor [[Dye-transfer process|dye-transfer]] printing was a "tie-in" product.&lt;ref&gt;The tie-in ensures the quality of the tied-good when the tied good (dye-transfer printing, in this case) is used in conjunction with the tying good (Three-Strip or Monopack origination, in this case), paraphrasing ''Tie-in Sales and Price Discrimination'', S. J. Liebowitz, University of Texas at Dallas.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16mm case, there were Eastman Kodak duplicating and printing stocks and associated chemistry, not the same as a "tie-in" product. In exceptional cases, Technicolor offered 16mm dye-transfer printing, but this necessitated the exceptionally wasteful process of printing on a 35mm base, only thereafter to be re-perforated and re-slit to 16mm, thereby discarding slightly more than one-half of the end product.

A late modification to the "Monopack Agreement", the "Imbibition Agreement", finally allowed Technicolor to economically manufacture 16mm dye-transfer prints as so-called "double-rank" 35/32mm prints (two 16mm prints on a 35mm base that was originally perforated at the 16mm specification for both halves, and was later re-slit into two 16mm wide prints without the need for re-perforation). This modification also facilitated the early experiments by Eastman Kodak with its negative-positive monopack film, which eventually became Eastmancolor. Essentially, the "Imbibition Agreement" lifted a portion of the "Monopack Agreement's" restrictions on Technicolor (which prevented it from making motion picture products less than 35mm wide) and somewhat related restrictions on Eastman Kodak (which prevented it from experimenting and developing monopack products greater than 16mm wide).

[[Eastmancolor]], introduced in 1950,&lt;ref name="motion.kodak.com"&gt;[http://motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Chronology_Of_Film/chrono2.htm Chronology of Motion Picture Films: 1940–1959] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625062139/http://motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Chronology_Of_Film/chrono2.htm |date=2009-06-25 }}, Kodak.&lt;/ref&gt; was Kodak's first economical, single-strip [[35 mm film|35 mm]] negative-positive process incorporated into one strip of film.  This rendered Three-Strip color photography relatively obsolete, even though, for the first few years of Eastmancolor, Technicolor continued to offer Three-Strip origination combined with dye-transfer printing (150 titles produced in 1953, 100 titles produced in 1954 and 50 titles produced in 1955, the very last year for Three-Strip).  The first commercial feature film to use Eastmancolor was the documentary ''[[Royal Journey]]'', released in December 1951.&lt;ref name="motion.kodak.com"/&gt;  Hollywood studios waited until an improved version of Eastmancolor negative came out in 1952 before using it; ''[[This is Cinerama]]'' was an early film which employed three separate and interlocked strips of Eastmancolor negative. ''This is Cinerama'' was initially printed on Eastmancolor positive, but its significant success eventually resulted in it being reprinted by Technicolor, using dye-transfer.

By 1953, and especially with the introduction of anamorphic wide screen [[Cinemascope|CinemaScope]], Eastmancolor became a marketing imperative as CinemaScope was incompatible with Technicolor's Three-Strip camera and lenses. Indeed, Technicolor Corp became one of the best, if not the best, processor of Eastmancolor negative, especially for so-called "wide gauge" negatives (5-perf 65mm, 6-perf 35mm), yet it far preferred its own 35mm dye-transfer printing process for Eastmancolor-originated films with a print run that exceeded 500 prints,&lt;ref&gt;At one point, Technicolor implemented a two-tiered print pricing structure, one for dye-transfer prints, which favored large volume printing, and one Eastmancolor prints, which favored small volume printing—but this was after the "tie-in" between origination and printing had been broken by the abandonment of Three-Strip and Monopack origination. For small print runs, dye-transfer remained an option, but at a significantly higher cost.&lt;/ref&gt; not withstanding the significant "loss of register" that occurred in such prints that were expanded by CinemaScope's 2X horizontal factor, and, to a lesser extent, with so-called "flat wide screen" (variously 1.66:1 or 1.85:1, but spherical and not anamorphic). This nearly fatal flaw was not corrected until 1955 and caused numerous features initially printed by Technicolor to be scrapped and reprinted by [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|DeLuxe Labs]]. (These features are often billed as "Color by Technicolor-DeLuxe".) Indeed, some Eastmancolor-originated films billed as "Color by Technicolor" were never actually printed using the dye-transfer process, due in part to the throughput limitations of Technicolor's dye-transfer printing process, and competitor DeLuxe's superior throughput. Incredibly, DeLuxe once had a license to install a Technicolor-type dye-transfer printing line, but as the "loss of register" problems became apparent in Fox's CinemaScope features that were printed by Technicolor, after Fox had become an all-CinemaScope producer, Fox-owned DeLuxe Labs abandoned its plans for dye-transfer printing and became, and remained, an all-Eastmancolor shop, as Technicolor itself later became.

Technicolor continued to offer its proprietary imbibition dye-transfer printing process for projection prints until 1975, and even briefly revived it in 1998.  As an archival format, Technicolor prints are one of the most stable color print processes yet created, and prints properly cared for are estimated to retain their color for centuries.&lt;ref name="wilhelm"&gt;Wilhelm, Henry with Brower, Carol (1993) ''The Permanence and Care of Color Photographs''.

==How a color film works==
[[Image:Color film.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A representation of the layers within a piece of developed color 35 mm negative film. When developed, the dye couplers in the blue-, green-, and red-sensitive layers turn the exposed silver halide crystals to their complementary colors (yellow, magenta, and cyan). The film is made up of (A) Clear protective topcoat, (B) UV filter, (C) "Fast" blue layer, (D) "Slow" blue layer, (E) Yellow filter to cut all blue light from passing through to (F) "Fast" green layer, (G) "Slow" green layer, (H) Inter (subbing) layer, (I) "Fast" red layer, (J) "Slow" red layer, (K) Clear triacetate base, and (L) Antihalation (rem-jet) backing.]]

A color film is made up of many different layers that work together to create the color image.  Color negative films provide three main color layers: the blue record, green record, and red record; each made up of two separate layers containing silver halide crystals and dye-couplers.  A cross-sectional representation of a piece of developed color negative film is shown in the figure at the right.  Each layer of the film is so thin that the composite of all layers, in addition to the triacetate base and antihalation backing, is less than 0.0003" (8&amp;nbsp;µm) thick.&lt;ref name="hone"&gt;''Kodak Motion Picture Film (H1)'' (4th ed). Eastman Kodak Company. {{ISBN|0-87985-477-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three color records are stacked as shown at right, with a UV filter on top to keep the non-visible ultraviolet radiation from exposing the silver-halide crystals, which are naturally sensitive to UV light.  Next are the fast and slow blue-sensitive layers, which, when developed, form the latent image.  When the exposed silver-halide crystal is developed, it is coupled with a dye grain of its complementary color.  This forms a dye "cloud" (like a drop of water on a paper towel) and is limited in its growth by development-inhibitor-releasing (DIR) couplers, which also serve to refine the sharpness of the processed image by limiting the size of the dye clouds. The dye clouds formed in the blue layer are actually yellow (the opposite or complementary color to blue).&lt;ref name="stockone"&gt;Holben, Jay. (April 2000). "Taking Stock" Part 1 of 2. ''American Cinematographer Magazine'' ASC Press. pp. 118-130&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two layers to each color; a "fast" and a "slow."  The fast layer features larger grains that are more sensitive to light than the slow layer, which has finer grain and is less sensitive to light.  Silver-halide crystals are naturally sensitive to blue light, so the blue layers are on the top of the film and they are followed immediately by a yellow filter, which stops any more blue light from passing through to the green and red layers and biasing those crystals with extra blue exposure.  Next are the red-sensitive record (which forms cyan dyes when developed); and, at the bottom, the green-sensitive record, which forms magenta dyes when developed.  Each color is separated by a gelatin layer that prevents silver development in one record from causing unwanted dye formation in another. On the back of the [[film base]] is an anti-halation layer that absorbs light which would otherwise be weakly reflected back through the film by that surface and create halos of light around bright features in the image. In color film, this backing is "rem-jet", a black-pigmented, non-gelatin layer which is removed in the developing process.&lt;ref name="hone" /&gt;

Eastman Kodak manufactures film in 54-inch (1,372&amp;nbsp;mm) wide rolls.  These rolls are then slit into various sizes (70&amp;nbsp;mm, 65&amp;nbsp;mm, 35&amp;nbsp;mm, 16&amp;nbsp;mm) as needed.

==Manufacturers of color film for motion picture use==
{{see also|List of motion picture film stocks}}

Motion picture film, primarily because of the rem-jet backing, requires different processing than standard [[C-41 process]] color film. The process necessary is ECN-2, which has an initial step using an alkaline bath to remove the backing layer. There are also minor differences in the remainder of the process. If motion picture negative is run through a standard C-41 color film developer bath, the rem-jet backing partially dissolves and destroys the integrity of the developer and, potentially, ruins the film.

===Kodak color motion picture films===
In the late 1980s, Kodak introduced the [[Tabular-grain film|T-Grain]] emulsion, a technological advancement in the shape and make-up of silver halide grains in their films. T-Grain is a tabular silver halide grain that allows for greater overall surface area, resulting in greater light sensitivity with a relatively small grain and a more uniform shape that results in a less overall graininess to the film. This made for sharper and more sensitive films. The T-Grain technology was first employed in Kodak's EXR line of motion picture color negative stocks.&lt;ref name="stocktwo"&gt;Probst, Christopher. (May 2000). "Taking Stock" Part 2 of 2 ''American Cinematographer Magazine'' ASC Press. pp. 110-120&lt;/ref&gt; This was further refined in 1996 with the Vision line of emulsions, followed by Vision2 in the early 2000s and Vision3 in 2007.

===Fuji color motion picture films===
Fuji films also integrate tabular grains in their SUFG (Super Unified Fine Grain) films. In their case, the SUFG grain is not only tabular, it is hexagonal and consistent in shape throughout the emulsion layers. Like the T-grain, it has a larger surface area in a smaller grain (about one-third the size of traditional grain) for the same light sensitivity. In 2005, Fuji unveiled their Eterna 500T stock, the first in a new line of advanced emulsions, with Super Nano-structure Σ Grain Technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39155">'''Digital storytelling''' is a short form of [[digital media]] production that allows everyday people to share aspects of their story. The media used may include the digital equivalent of [[film technique]]s (full-motion video with sound), stills, audio only, or any of the other forms of non-physical media (material that exists only as [[electronic file]]s as opposed to actual paintings or photographs on paper, sounds stored on tape or disc, movies stored on film) which individuals can use to tell a story or present an idea.

==Introduction==
"Digital storytelling" is a relatively new term which describes the new practice of everyday people who use digital tools to tell their 'story'. Digital stories often present in compelling and emotionally engaging formats, and can be interactive.

The term "digital storytelling" can also cover a range of digital narratives (web-based stories, interactive stories, hypertexts, and narrative computer games); It is sometimes used to refer to film-making in general, and as of late, it has been used to describe advertising and promotion efforts by commercial and non-profit enterprises.

One can define digital storytelling as the process by which diverse peoples share their life stories and creative imaginings with others. This newer form of storytelling emerged with the advent of accessible media production techniques, hardware and software, including but not limited to digital cameras, digital voice recorders, [[iMovie]], [[Windows Movie Maker]] and [[Final Cut Express]]. These new technologies allow individuals to share their stories over the Internet on [[YouTube]], [[Vimeo]], compact discs, [[podcast]]s, and other electronic distribution systems.

One can think of digital storytelling as the modern extension of the ancient art of storytelling, now interwoven with digitized still and moving images and sound. Thanks to new media and digital technologies, individuals can approach storytelling from unique perspectives. Many people use elaborate non-traditional story forms, such as non-linear and interactive narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moursund|first=Dave|title=Information Age Education|url=http://i-a-e.org/articles/46-feature-articles/50-digital-storytelling.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simply put, digital stories are multimedia presentations that combine a variety of communicative elements within a narrative structure. Media may include any combination of the following: text, images, video, audio, social media elements (like tweets), or interactive elements (like maps).  

Digital stories may be used as an expressive medium within the classroom to integrate subject matter with extant knowledge and skills from across the curriculum. Students can work individually or collaboratively to produce their own digital stories. Once completed, these stories can easily be uploaded to the internet and can be made available to an international audience, depending on the topic and purpose of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roland|first=Craig|title=Digital Stories in the Classroom|journal=School Art|date=March 2006|volume=105|series=7|issue=7|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and pioneers==

The broad definition has been used by many artists and producers to link what they do with traditions of oral storytelling and often to distinguish their work from slick or commercial projects by focusing on authorship and humanistic or emotionally provocative content. Digital Storytelling has been used by [[Ken Burns]], in the documentary ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]],'' cited as one of the first models of this genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sylvester|first=Ruth|author2=Wendy-lou Greenidge|title=Digital Storytelling: Extending the Potential for Struggling Writers|journal=The Reading Teacher|date=December 2009|volume=63|issue=4|pages=284–295|doi=10.1598/rt.63.4.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his documentary, Burns used first-person accounts that served to reveal the heart and emotions of this tragic event in American history, as well as narration, archival images, modern cinematography, and music (Sylvester &amp; Greenidge, 2009). Some of the other artists who have described themselves as digital storytellers are the late [[Dana Atchley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dana|first=Atchley|title=Pioneer of Digital Storytelling|url=http://www.nextexit.com/nextexit/nextframeset.html|work=Next Exit|publisher=Dana Atchley Productions|accessdate=6 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219064738/http://www.nextexit.com/nextexit/nextframeset.html|archivedate=19 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; his collaborator [[Joe Lambert]], [[Abbe Don]], [[Brenda Laurel]], and [[Pedro Meyer]].

The "short narrated films" definition of digital storytelling comes from a production workshop by Dana Atchley at the [[American Film Institute]] in 1993 that was adapted and refined by Joe Lambert in the mid-1990s into a method of training promoted by the San Francisco Bay Area-based StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling).&lt;ref name=woletz&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Information Science Reference| isbn = 9781599048635| pages = 587–601| editors = Sigrid Kelsey and Kirk St Amant (eds.)| last = Woletz| first = Julie D.| title = Handbook of research on computer mediated communication| chapter = Digital Storytelling from Artificial Intelligence to YouTube| location = Hershey, PA| year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling), digital stories are produced in intensive workshops. The product is a short film that combines a narrated piece of personal writing, photographic and other still images, and a musical soundtrack. Technology enables those without a technical background to produce works that tell a story using "moving" images and sound. The lower processing and memory requirements for using stills as compared with video, and the ease with which the so-called "Ken Burns" pan effect can be produced with video editing software, have made it easy to create good-looking short films.

Digital storytelling was integrated into [[public broadcasting]] by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]'s ''Capture Wales'' project working with organisations such as Breaking Barriers. The following year a similar project was launched by the BBC in England titled ''Telling Lives''. [[Sveriges Utbildningsradio]] created ''Rum för Berättande'' (''Room for Storytelling'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ur.se/rfb/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206003423/http://www.ur.se/rfb/|title=URs Rum för Berättande - dina digitala berättelser online / digitalt berättande|archivedate=6 December 2006|work=ur.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netherlands Educational TV Teleac/NOT created a program with young people in different parts of the country. KQED, Rocky Mountain PBS, WETA and other public television stations in the US have developed projects. Digital storytelling is evolving from the simple narrated video to forms that are interactive and look better. These include websites and online videos created to promote causes, entertain, educate, and inform audiences.

==Components==

The most important characteristics of a digital story are that it no longer conforms to the traditional conventions of storytelling because it is capable of combining still imagery, moving imagery, sound, and text, as well as being nonlinear and contain interactive features.  The expressive capabilities of technology offers a broad base from which to integrate. It enhances the experience for both the author and audience and allows for greater interactivity.

With the arrival of new media devices like computers, digital cameras, recorders, and software, individuals may share their digital stories via the Internet, on discs, [[podcasts]], or other electronic media. Digital storytelling combines the art of storytelling with multimedia features such as photography, text, audio, voiceover, [[hypertext]] and video. Digital tools and software make it easy and convenient to create a digital story. Common software includes iMovie and Movie Maker for user-friendly options. There are other online options and free applications as well.

Educators often identify the benefit of digital storytelling as the array of technical tools from which students may select for their creative expression. Learners set out to use these tools in new ways to make meaningful content. Students learn new software, choose images, edit video, make voiceover narration, add music, create title screens, and control flow and transitions. Additionally, there is opportunity to insert interactive features for "reader" participation.  It is possible to click on imagery or text in order to choose what will happen next, cause an event to occur, or navigate to online content.

Additionally, distinctions may be drawn between [[Web 2.0]] storytelling and that of digital storytelling. Web 2.0 storytelling is said to produce a network of connections via social networking, blogging, and [[YouTube]] that transcends beyond the traditional, singular flow of digital storytelling. It tends to "aggregate large amounts of microcontent and creatively select patterns out of an almost unfathomable volume of information,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rossiter|first=M|author2=Garcia|title=Digital Storytelling: A New Player on the Narrative Field|journal=New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|year=2010|issue=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  therefore the bounds of Web 2.0 storytelling are not necessarily clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alexander|first=B|author2=Levine|title=Web 2.0 Storytelling: Emergence of a New Genre|journal=EDUCAUSE Review|year=2008|volume=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of digital storytelling is the [[micromovie]], which is "a very short exposition lasting from a few seconds to no more than 5 minutes in length. It allows the teller to combine personal writing, photographic images or video footage, narrative, sound effects, and music. Many people, regardless of skill level, are able to tell their stories through image and sound and share those stories with others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Storytelling|url=http://i-a-e.org/articles/46-feature-articles/50-digital-storytelling.html|publisher=Information Age Education|accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telling a digital story combines a narrative, whether it be fiction or non fiction, personal or general, and digital media.  Digital media includes imaging, video, sound and all other forms of media then can be portrayed visually, the most simple of digital stories can even be a power point.  The point is to convey a message through imagery, which a lot of times can be more effective then if just conveyed through sound.  In my opinion a digital story can even be told by some social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram, where you are constantly posting images accompanied by captions in order to portray the story of your life. "A story can be as short as explaining how you misplaced your keys this morning or as long as a multivolume autobiography", the wonderful thing about telling a digital story is that there really are no rules.  Like any story you want to capture, your audience it is so important when telling a digital story. So, to sell your story, as a writer, a filmmaker, a dramatist, you more often than not will ask yourself about what stories could be more compelling to you and where you might find an interesting and profound dramatic story.

==Uses in education==
The StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) model has also been adopted in education, especially in the US, sometimes as a method of building engagement and [[multimedia literacy]]. For example, the Bay Area Video Coalition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=StoryCenter|url=http://www.storycenter.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Youthworx Media Melbourne&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=YouthWorx Media|url=http://youthworx.org.au/welcome/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709005753/http://youthworx.org.au/welcome/|archivedate=2011-07-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; employ digital storytelling to engage and empower young people at risk.

===Uses in primary and secondary education===

"The idea of merging traditional storytelling with today's digital tools is spreading worldwide."  Anybody today with a computer can create a digital story simply by answering such questions as "What do you think? What do you feel?  What is important? How do we find meaning in our lives?"&lt;ref name="kompar"&gt;{{cite web | first1 = F. | last1 = Komplar | url = http://www.greenwichschools.org/page.cfm?p=4201 | title = Digital Storytelling }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most digital stories focus on a specific topic and contain a particular point of view. "These topics can range from personal tales to the recounting of historical events, from exploring life in one's own community to the search for life in other corners of the universe and every story in between."&lt;ref name="kompar" /&gt;

For primary grades the focus is related to what is being taught, a story that will relate to the students. For primary grades the story is kept under five minutes to retain attention. Vibrant pictures, age-appropriate music and narration are needed.  Narration accompanied by subtitles can also help build vocabulary. Content-related digital stories can help upper-elementary and middle-school students understand abstract or layered concepts. For example, in one 5th grade class a teacher used digital storytelling to depict the anatomy of the eye and describe its relationship to a camera. A fifth grader said, "This year I have learned that places are not just physical matter but emotional places in peoples' hearts.  iMovie has made all my thoughts and feelings come alive in an awesome movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = T. | last1 = Banaszewski | url = http://www.infotoday.com/mmschools/jan02/banaszewski.htm | title = Digital Storytelling Finds its Place in the Classroom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These aspects of digital storytelling, pictures, music, and narration reinforce ideas and appeal to different learning types. Teachers can use it to introduce projects, themes, or any content area, and can also let their students make their own digital stories and then share them.  Teachers can create digital stories to help facilitate class discussions, as an anticipatory set for a new topic, or to help students gain a better understanding of more abstract concepts.  These stories can become an integral part of any lesson in many subject areas.  Students can also create their own digital stories and the benefits that they can receive from it can be quite plentiful.  Through the creation of these stories students are required to take ownership of the material they are presenting.  They have to analyze and synthesize information as well.  All of this supports higher level thinking. Students are able to give themselves a voice through expressing their own thoughts and ideas.

When students are able participate in the multiple steps of designing, creating and presenting their own digital stories, they can build several literacy skills. These include the following: Research skills by finding and analyzing information when documenting the story, writing skills when developing a script, and organization skills by managing the scope of the project within a time constraint. Technology skills can be gained through learning to use a variety of tools, such as digital cameras and multimedia authoring software and presentation skills through the presentation of the story to an audience. Students also gain interview, interpersonal, problem-solving and assessment skills through completing their digital story and learning to receive and give constructive criticism.&lt;ref name="Robin" /&gt;

Software such as [[iMovie]], [[Photo Story]] 3 or [[Windows Movie Maker|Movie Maker]] do all that is required.

Faculty and graduate students at the [[University of Houston]] have created a website, The Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalstorytelling.coe.uh.edu/|title=Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling|work=uh.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on the use of digital storytelling by teachers and their students across multiple content areas and grade levels.

The [[National Writing Project]] has a collaboration with the [[Pearson Foundation]] examining the literacy practices, the values, attitudes, beliefs and feelings, associated with their digital storytelling work with students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = National Writing Project | url = http://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/nwp_amsession/1417 | title = Examining the Writing Processes of Digital Storytelling }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use by teachers in curriculum===

&lt;blockquote&gt;Teachers can incorporate digital storytelling into their instruction for several reasons.  Two reasons include 1) to incorporate multimedia into their curriculum and 2) Teachers can also introduce storytelling in combination with social networking in order to increase global participation, collaboration, and communication skills.  Moreover, digital storytelling is a way to incorporate and teach the twenty-first century student the twenty-first century technology skills such as information literacy, visual literacy, global awareness, communication and technology literacy.&lt;ref name="kompar" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The educational goals for teachers using digital storytelling are to generate interest, attention and motivation for students of the "digital generation" in classrooms. The use of digital storytelling as a presentation tool also appeals to the diverse learning styles of students. Digital storytelling also capitalizes on students' creative talents and allows their work to be published on the [[Internet]] for others to view and critique.&lt;ref name="Robin"&gt;{{cite conference | first1 = Bernard | last1 = Robin | url = http://faculty.coe.uh.edu/brobin/TLA/pages/03.htm | title = Digital Storytelling Hands-On Lab | booktitle = The Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling | location = Austin, TX | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A handful of teachers around the world have embraced digital storytelling from a mobile platform. The use of small handheld devices allows teachers and students to create short digital stories without the need for expensive editing software. iOS devices are the norm nowadays and mobile digital storytelling applications like The Fold Game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefoldgame.com/|title=The Fold • unfold stories with friends|work=thefoldgame.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; have introduced an entirely new set of tools for the classroom.

With an emphasis on collaborative learning and hands on teaching, this website offer an in depth look at how to integrate 21st Century Skills with the objectives of a rigorous academic program:

===Uses in higher education===

Digital storytelling spread in higher education in the late nineties with StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) collaborating with a number of Universities while based at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]].  StoryCenter programs with the [[New Media Consortium]] led to links to many campuses where programs in digital storytelling have grown; these include University of Maryland Baltimore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umbc.edu/stories|title=Digital Stories @ UMBC|work=umbc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cal State Monterey, Ohio State University, Williams College, MIT,  and the University of Wisconsin, Madison.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The University of Colorado, Denver,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.storycenter.org/certificate.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402063802/http://www.storycenter.org/certificate.html |archivedate=2010-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kean University, Virginia Tech, Simmons College, Swarthmore College, the University of Calgary, University of Massachusetts (Amherst), the Maricopa County Community Colleges (AZ),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maricopa.edu/curriculum/A-C/056art150.html|title=Maricopa Community Colleges  ART150     20056-99999 |work=maricopa.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others have developed programs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. The University of Utah offered its first class on digital storytelling (Writing 3040) in the Fall of 2010. The program has grown from 10 students the first semester to over 30 in 2011, including 5 graduate students. [[Mark Tatge|Chicago journalist Mark Tatge]] started a Digital Storytelling program at [[DePauw University]] in 2011. Students learned journalistic-style storytelling techniques and published the resulting stories on a class website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tellingdigitalstories.com|title=Digital Storytelling|work=Digital Storytelling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of digital storytelling among humanities faculty connected with the [[American Studies Crossroads Project]] was a further evolution through a combination of both personal and academic storytelling.  Starting in 2001, Rina Benmayor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcom.csumb.edu/faculty/2tier/faculty/fulltime/rina.html|title=Division of Humanities &amp; Communication|work=csumb.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511004521/http://hcom.csumb.edu/faculty/2tier/faculty/fulltime/rina.html|archivedate=2009-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from California State University-Monterey Bay) hosted a StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) seminar and began using digital storytelling in her Latino/a life stories classes. Benmayor began sharing that work with faculty across the country involved in the Visible Knowledge Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digitalcommons.georgetown.edu/blogs/vkp/|title=- Visible Knowledge Project|work=georgetown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Georgetown University; LaGuardia Community College, CUNY; Millersville University; Vanderbilt University, and University of Wisconsin–Stout.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Out of this work emerged publications in several key academic journals{{vague|date=November 2010}}&lt;!-- name them --&gt; as well as the Digital Storytelling Multimedia Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digitalcommons.georgetown.edu/projects/digitalstories/|title=Digital Stories - Introduction|work=georgetown.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ball State University]] has a masters program in digital storytelling based in the Telecommunications Department,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} as does the University of Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/imk/MEVIT4130/index.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[University of Mary Washington]] launched an open online course in digital storytelling titled DS106.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds106.us|title=Welcome to ds106|work=ds106.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course includes credit-seeking students at the University as well as many open, online participants from around the world.

Digital storytelling is also used as an instructional strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daigle|first=Brent|author2=Sulentic-Dowell|title=Can Digital Storytelling Improve Literacy Outcomes for Students with Autism?|journal=Georgia Journal of Reading|date=Spring 2010|volume=33|issue=1|pages=25–34|url=http://www.slideshare.net/brentdaigle/georgia-journal-of-reading-4262677}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowenthal, P. R. (2009). Digital storytelling—An emerging institutional technology? In J. Hartley &amp; K. McWilliam (Eds.), ''Story circle: Digital storytelling around the world'' (pp. 252-259). Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; to not only build relationships and establish people's social presence online but also as an alternative format to present content.{{vague|date=November 2010}}&lt;!-- This sounds very grand, but what does it actually mean? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowenthal, P.

===Uses in public health, healthcare, social services, and international development===
[[File:Getting out of gangs (8517217065).jpg|thumb|"Day Walker" was Welcome's [[nickname]] in the [[Sonke Gender Justice]] "One Man Can" campaign tackling HIV and gender-based violence.]]

The development of the [[Silence Speaks]] project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silencespeaks.org|title=Silence Speaks|work=Silence Speaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999 under the direction of Amy Hill (who joined the StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) in 2005) led to the expansion of digital storytelling in public health. Projects developed with the [[Centers for Disease Control]], the [[Open Society Foundation]], work in gender-based violence prevention with groups in California, Texas, New York, Minnesota, and with the organization [[Sonke Gender Justice]] in South Africa, the broad use of digital storytelling with [[Foster Youth]], and finally the connection to digital storytelling to public campaigns in substance abuse prevention and community mental health programs.

Digital storytelling is being used to raise awareness of the "human" factors in healthcare.

The [http://www.patientvoices.org.uk Patient Voices programme] is the product of Pip Hardy and Tony Sumner. Established in 2003, their project provides a means for people (patients, families or healthcare workers) to tell their stories which might affect clinicians, managers and decision-makers in the healthcare arena. The Programme has worked closely with The Royal College of Nursing, The National Clinical Governance Support Team, The National Audit Office, NHS England, NHS Improving Quality, Imperial College Healthcare Trust, Kings College London, University College London and many other NHS organisations and universities. Patient Voices projects have also taken place in Canada, Australia, Norway, Hong Kong and Tanzania and the stories are used in schools of medicine and healthcare throughout the world to prompt reflection and stimulate discussion and debate.

The Patient Voices programme also provides a freely accessible resource to anyone who desires to improve the quality of health and social care. All stories, once released, are  available at The Patient Voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patientvoices.org.uk/stories.htm|title=Patient Voices: The Patient Voices digital stories|work=patientvoices.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stories have contributed to an understanding of patients' experiences and their role in their illness as well as to a greater understanding of the experience of people who work in healthcare.&lt;ref&gt; Haigh, C. and Hardy, P. (2010) Tell me a story: a conceptual exploration of storytelling in healthcare. Nurse Education Today&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the process of creating a Patient Voices digital story has been used to enhance the reflective skills of newly qualified nurses and medical students.&lt;ref&gt;Stacey, G., &amp; Hardy, P. (2010). Challenging the shock of reality through digital storytelling. Nurse Education in Practice&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses in museums===
Digital storytelling is being used by many different museums.

The largest project,  ''Culture Shock!'', is currently taking place in the North East of England.&lt;ref name="Cultureshock"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Cultureshock | url = http://www.cultureshock.org.uk/about.html | title = Cultureshock! - About }}&lt;/ref&gt; This project is using museum and gallery collections to inspire people to create their own digital stories, which are also being added to the relevant museum collections.

Another large-scale project is the work of the [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]].

The [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington D.C. also held a series of classes to integrate arts education curriculum with digital storytelling from 2003-2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = J. | last1 = Springer | first2 = S. | last2 = Kajder | first3 = J. | last3 = Borst | url = http://www.museumsandtheweb.com/mw2004/papers/springer/springer.html | title = Digital Storytelling at the National Gallery of Art }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some museums help interpret and make community history accessible. In 2007, the [[Colorado Historical Society]] collaborated with StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) to create a program, ''The Italians,'' about Italian American History.  In 2008, a group of eleven museums in Yorkshire launched ''My Yorkshire,'' a digital storytelling project.&lt;ref&gt;http://myyorkshire.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The museums work with communities to use contemporary collected oral histories alongside those from archives to interpret local history from a personal point of view, through the use of historical oral recordings and archival photos. The group has also produced help guides to creating digital stories in a museum setting.

Finished digital stories can have many uses: advertising an upcoming exhibition, preserving a short-term project, building relations with communities. They provide skills to volunteers and can be permanently displayed in galleries.

===Uses for religious training===

In 2005, the Church of Norway initiated a project wherein young people raised questions of faith and life in short biographical mini-films called 'Digital Faith Stories'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital faith stories|url=http://www.uv.uio.no/intermedia/english/research/projects/mediatized-stories/studies/digital-faith.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study of this project in a congregation near Oslo found that the method of 'Digital Storytelling' could contribute to a more systematic educational method for including the lifeworld of the young in religious training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaare|first=Birgit Hertzberg|title=Youth as Producers: Digital stories of faith and life|journal=Nordicom Review|year=2008|volume=29|issue=2|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in libraries==

A digital story station is a public space for people to create a digital story that serves to archive oral histories from the public perspective.  These oral stories may focus on a personal experience, incident, describing a place or witnessing an event.  Based on the StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) model, over 30 public libraries ranging from Northern down the coast to Southern California have a place for people to tell their own story.

Bilingual library staff work with participants to create a recording using the digital station, which can be integrated with a variety of media, including audio, video, pictures, and images. The digital storytelling station project called ''California of the Past'' is funded by a grant from the California State Library, U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services and Technology Act, and administered in California by librarians. The Media Arts Center in San Diego facilitates this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oakland Library|url=http://www.oaklandlibrary.org/PR/pr010509digitalstory.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922052123/http://www.oaklandlibrary.org/PR/pr010509digitalstory.htm|archivedate=2011-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, San Diego has housed a story station in its downtown library. The Media Arts Center of San Diego partnered with the downtown public library to set up a story station where the public can create a three-minute video. The topics of the archived videos range from personal to historical documentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Media Arts Center|url=http://www.mediaartscenter.org/site/c.dfLIJPOvHoE/b.3469457/k.6F12/Digital_Story_Station.htm|accessdate=June 26, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009030357/http://www.mediaartscenter.org/site/c.dfLIJPOvHoE/b.3469457/k.6F12/Digital_Story_Station.htm|archivedate=October 9, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in business==
With the development of marketing in the digital world is digital storytelling implemented in business.
Digital storytelling is used as a tool of [[user-generated content]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/marketing-digital/lecture/mqL1l/digital-concept-user-generated-content-part-1/|title=Digital Concept: User Generated Content, Part1 in the Course :Marketing in Digital World |publisher= [[Coursera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; when consumers contribute their opinion based on their own experiences about a product to promote a firm's product in the digital world.

Digital storytelling is being used by innovative startups to pitch their ideas to the potential investors and to communicate with potential customers to get feedback about the market potential of their product or service.
 
The Enterprise Center with Salem State University organized a Big Idea Video Pitch Contest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enterprisectr.org/big-idea-video-pitch-competition/|title=Big Idea Video Pitch Competition}}&lt;/ref&gt;  competition for students to submit a 60-second video pitch of a unique idea for a business, non-profit or social cause. People could vote once per day using the "vote now" button that is displayed in the voting section. The Digital Story that receives the most votes was awarded. Videos were judged on originality, creativity, and the clarity of message.
 
Project [[SomePitching]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somepitching.com/|title=SomePitching}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a crowdsourced online competition for new business ideas and early stage startups to provide feedback on their product and business ideas. The freeform explanation could be a website, a short pitching video or an animation (max. 90 seconds), a slideset (max. 5 pages with font size 20+), or any other material (or combination of materials) that was short and clear for anyone to evaluate.

SomePitching used the Innopinion platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.innopinion.com/|title=Innopinion platform}}&lt;/ref&gt; to manage the idea rating process and the selection of winners based on the ratings from both the public and professional jury.

The intent of this competition wasn't to present the best Big Idea of the product, service, or solution only, but also to find the way, how to interpret it by Digital Story the best way from visual and narrative point of view. Because in the public jury phase, the evaluations was based on the following categories (with percent of the final score):
*Interest to buy or use the solution (20%)
*The importance of the problem the solution solves (20%)
*The value the solution brings (20%)
*The clarity and quality of the material (20%)

==Place-based digital storytelling==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
The [[Canadian Film Centre]]'s New Media Lab (formerly MediaLinx Habitat) launched a project, Murmur, out of the 2002–2003 studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.murmurtoronto.ca|title=hear you are --- [murmur] Toronto|work=murmurtoronto.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project integrates audio interviews into cellphone-based tours. StoryCenter (formerly the Center for Digital Storytelling) created Storymapping.org in 2006 with projects in [[Mendocino, California|Mendocino]] (California), [[Houston]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] (Alabama) to promote the connection between storytelling and issues of local memory and civic planning.

'''The Voice Library (TVL)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.TheVoiceLibrary.net|title=THE VOICE LIBRARY - Digital storytelling: Instantly record and share voices for generations to come.|work=thevoicelibrary.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched two, ongoing, social-giving projects in 2014. ''The Military Families Story Project'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militarystoryproject.thevoicelibrary.net/|title=Military Families Story Project by The Voice Library|work=thevoicelibrary.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; based out of Portsmouth, NH, maintains and strengthens families' ties, builds morale through a brother-/sisterhood network, enables service men and women and their families to record history as they make it, and memorializes veterans' experiences. TVL's national ''Let Me Be Your Memory''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letmebeyourmemory.net/|title=Let Me Be Your Memory - Powered by TheVoiceLibrary.net &amp; Cognitive Dynamics|work=letmebeyourmemory.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; project, in collaboration with '''Cognitive Dynamics''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cognitivedynamics.org/2010/09/welcome-to-cognitive-dynamics/|title=Welcome to Cognitive Dynamics|author=SonarDNS|work=cognitivedynamics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a unique, six-week audio-based archiving Language Arts curriculum for students and educational institutions that builds multiple, Common Core-adaptable competencies by raising awareness of those living with memory disorders and their caregivers. It stimulates students to learn, investigate, and connect with family and community. The Voice Library changes the digital storytelling paradigm by providing users passcode-protected access through any telephone technology. It also provides online access. [[Interactive web stories|Both combine audio and still-image capability.]] For 24/7, global access, unlike social media, subscribers' private accounts are secured on the company's server.

The '''Eberswalde Hoard''' or '''Treasure of Eberswalde''' ({{lang-de|Schatz von Eberswalde}} or {{lang|de|Goldfund von Eberswalde}}) is a [[Bronze Age]] [[hoard]] of 81 [[gold]] objects with a total weight of {{convert|2.59|kg|ozt|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/content/2004/02/01/brandenburg/656911.html|newspaper=Berliner Morgenpost|date=February 1, 2004|title=unknown/missing}}{{dead link|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest prehistoric assembly of gold objects ever found in [[Germany]], it is considered to be one of the most important finds from the [[Central Europe]]an Bronze Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eller|first=Carmen|title=Erbeutetes Gold als heißes Eisen|url=http://www.deutsche-allgemeine-zeitung.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=885&amp;Itemid=29|accessdate=5 November 2013|newspaper=Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung|date=March 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, it is in Russia, as part of the [[Looted_art#Looting_of_Germany|group of artifacts and works of art looted from Germany]] at the end of the [[Second World War]].

==Discovery==
The hoard was discovered 1&amp;nbsp;m (3&amp;nbsp;ft) below the ground surface on May 16, 1913, during excavations for a house within the grounds of a brass factory at Finow ([[Oberbarnim]]), part of [[Eberswalde]] in [[Brandenburg]]. The factory supervisor alerted [[Carl Schuchhardt]], the director of the [[Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte (Berlin)|Prehistoric Department of the Royal Museums]] at [[Berlin]], who acceded the hoard to that collection.

==Description==
The hoard had been deposited in a globular vessel with a lid. In it were eight gold bowls, which contained another 73 gold objects. The bowls were thin-walled chased gold vessels with copious [[Ornament (art)|ornamental decoration]]. The other objects included neck rings, bracelets and 60 wire arm spirals. 55 double spirals were tied into bundles. A gold [[ingot]], a piece of metal shaped like a [[crucible]] and two smaller pieces probably represent raw material for the production of such objects. The treasure belongs to the goldsmith known as Villena-type, for its resemblance to the [[Treasure of Villena]].

==Origin, date==
The hoard used to be thought to represent the stores of a merchant.{{cn|date=November 2013}} More recent research suggests that it was of religious significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eluère|first=Christiane|authorlink=Christiane Éluère|title=Goldwork of the Iron Age in `Barbarian' Europe|journal=Gold Bulletin|date=December 1985|volume=18|issue=4|page=150|doi=10.1007/BF03214697|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03214697|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoard is dated to the 9th century BC. &lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|last=Hickley|first=Catherine|title=Gold Hoard, Trophy Art Stay in Russia as Ties With Germany Cool|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=anWdULPhvgxE|accessdate=4 November 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=September 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history==
After the end of the [[Second World War]] in 1945, the Eberswalde Hoard disappeared from the Berlin museum, along with the so-called [[Priam's Treasure|"Treasure of Priam"]]. The suspicion that the [[Red Army]] might have removed both finds was denied by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] for decades. After Russian president [[Boris Yeltsin]] admitted that "Priam's Treasure" was in Russian hands, the authorities ceased to explicitly deny that they also held Eberswalde Hoard. In 2004, a reporter from German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' located it in a secret depot within [[Moscow]]'s [[Pushkin Museum]]. Germany has request return of the materials, and the issue has caused tension between the German and Russian governments.&lt;ref name=WhatIsIt&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawksley|first=Rupert|title=The Eberswalde Hoard: what exactly is it?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/10135355/The-Eberswalde-Hoard-what-exactly-is-it.html|accessdate=4 November 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=21 Jun 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reproductions of the hoard are on display at the [[Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte (Berlin)|Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte]] in Berlin and the [[Stadt- und Kreismuseum]] in [[Eberswalde]]. The Eberswalde replica is by local goldsmith Eckhard Herrmann.&lt;ref&gt;Märkische Oderzeitung, October 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federal Monuments Office''' (BDA; {{lang-de|Bundesdenkmalamt}}) is a department of the [[Federal Chancellery of Austria|Federal Chancellery]] responsible for [[cultural heritage]] in [[Austria]].

==History==
The BDA was established in 1853 under [[Emperor Franz Joseph I]], as a central commission for the preservation of [[National Heritage Site]]s. Its duties include the preservation, restoration and cataloging of immoveable cultural heritage. The BDA also monitors the export provisions of the Austrian monument protection act for moveable cultural heritage. The BDA is divided into one central bureau and nine "land conservation districts" in the provincial capitals. At their disposal are the following central departments:
* [[Historic buildings]]
* Garden architecture ([[Historic garden conservation]] and historic parks)
* Restored workshops Baudenkmalpflege
* [[Industrial heritage]] (historic factories)
* Export licenses for cultural heritage
* [[Archeological site]]s
* Heritage lists
* Inventory and Heritage Studies (publisher of the [[Georg Dehio]] manual) 
* "Sound monuments" (church bells and organs)
* Museums &amp; libraries (excluding national museums)
* Legal Matters (conservation law)
* Art restoration workshops; namely the Central Chemical Laboratory of the Federal Monuments Office at the [[Arsenal (Vienna)|Vienna Arsenal]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bda.at/organisation/1034/  Naturwissenschaftliches Zentrallabor], BDA&lt;/ref&gt; and the Architectural conservation restoration workshop in the [[Mauerbach Charterhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bda.at/organisation/1034/  Restaurierwerkstätten Baudenkmalpflege Kartause Mauerbach], BDA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art and property restitution==
The BDA is also responsible for restitution of some 8,000 objects and works of [[Looted art#Looting by Nazi Germany|looted art]] which [[Austria in the time of National Socialism]] had acquired by devious means. Since often the original owners and all of their relatives had been killed during the [[Holocaust]], restitution took place in the manner of auctions for the benefit of the Jewish community or to pay for material restitution of destroyed property, as in the case of the [[Jewish cemetery in Währing]]. Austria first did little to restore property to the damaged owner, but in the late 40's and 50's was put under pressure to make more of an effort according to the [[Moscow Declaration#Declaration regarding Austria|Moscow Declaration]]. As access to archives has slowly opened over time for provenance research, new clues and details such as stickers on the backs of auctioned objects that were photographed, have resulted in the discovery of previously "unfindable" owners. A set of such results was published in early December 2008 and exhibited at the [[Museum für angewandte Kunst Wien|Museum of Applied Arts]].

In [[bookbinding]], '''finishing''' refers to the process of decorating the outside of a book, including the lettering of the spine and covers, any additional [[tooling (bookbinding)|tooling]], and any [[inlays and onlays (bookbinding)|inlays and onlays]].  Finishing can also include the [[gilding]] or other decoration of the edges of the book's pages.

Early codices, such as [[Coptic binding]]s had relatively simple finishing, including blind tooling and leather strips woven through covering material.

In traditional bookbinding, finishing is done by hand, and is a highly skilled process.  Until the second half of the 20th century, finishing was largely performed by men who specialized in gilding; they would receive the book after the process of sewing and covering the book, known as [[forwarding (bookbinding)|forwarding]], was complete.

In the broadest sense, any book with decoration other than its covering material (such as a title) can be considered finished, though the term is usually applied only to books that have been decorated extensively by hand.

The '''flag of [[Asturias]]''' shows the "Cruz de la Victoria" ([[Victory Cross]]) in yellow ([[Pantone Matching System|PMS]] 109) over blue (PMS 829).

==History==
The origin of the flag of Asturias is in 1808, during the [[Peninsular War]]. As there was not any [[Flag of Spain|Spanish national flag]] yet, Asturians created the current flag, without any separatist intention in the war against the [[French First Empire|Napoleon's empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavozdeasturias.es/noticia/asturias/2016/09/07/tres-independencias-asturias/00031473241728887787807.htm|title=Los tres momentos históricos en los que Asturias pudo ser independiente|publisher=La Voz de Asturias|date=8 September 2016|accessdate=8 September 2016|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first version, it included the motto ''Asturias jamás vencida'' (Asturias never defeated).

==Design==
According to the tradition, the [[Victory Cross]] was carried by [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]], first [[Kingdom of Asturias|King of Asturias]], in the decisive [[Battle of Covadonga]] against the Moors in 722. This battle, fought in the mountains of Asturias, was hailed by 19th and 20th century historiography as the start of the [[Reconquista]], the Christian re-conquest of the Iberian peninsula from the Moorish domination. However, there is not any historical evidence about the use of this cross.

In 908 the Asturian King [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III the Great]] ordered that the original wooden cross, made of oak, be clad in gold and precious stones. Currently, it is kept in the [[Cámara Santa|Holy Chamber]] of the [[Oviedo Cathedral]].

The Greek letters [[Alpha and Omega]] hang from its horizontal axis. This is a direct reference to the [[Book of Revelation]] (verses 1:8, 21:6, and 22:13)., ''I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, says the Lord God, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.''

[[Image:Kanteletar.jpg|thumb|180px|''Kanteletar taikka Suomen Kansan Wanhoja Lauluja ja Wirsiä'']]

'''''Kanteletar''''' is a collection of [[Culture of Finland|Finnish]] [[folk poetry]] compiled by [[Elias Lönnrot]]. It is considered to be a sister collection to the Finnish [[national epic]] ''[[Kalevala]]''. The poems of ''Kanteletar'' are based on the [[trochaic tetrameter]], generally referred to as "Kalevala metre".

The name consists of the base word ''[[kantele]]'' (a Finnish [[zither]]-like instrument) and the [[Grammatical gender|feminising]] [[morpheme]] ''-tar'' and can be roughly interpreted as "maiden of the kantele" or "zither-daughter", a kind of [[muse]].&lt;ref&gt;http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Kanteletar/Keith-Bosley/e/9780192828620&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

''Kanteletar'' was published in 1840 under the name ''Kanteletar taikka Suomen Kansan Wanhoja Lauluja ja Wirsiä'' (''"Kanteletar or Old Songs and Hymns of the Finnish People"''). Lönnrot got the foundation for the collection on his journeys in 1838 after he met rune singer Mateli Kuivalatar on the banks of the [[Koitere]]. The poems sung by Kuivalatar were recorded in Lönnrot's notes.

''Kanteletar'' consists of three books. The first book includes 238 lyrical poems which Lönnrot named ''Yhteisiä Lauluja'' or "Common Songs". These songs are divided into four sections: common themes, for a wedding crowd, [[shepherd]]s, and children. The second book contains 354 lyrical poems which was called ''Erityisiä Lauluja'' or "Special Songs". These songs are divided as songs for girls, women, boys and men. There are 60 historic poems, [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]], [[legend]]s, [[ballad]]s and lyrical [[epic poem]]s in the third book, which is called ''Virsi-Lauluja'' or "Hymns". There are 24 new poems in the [[preface]].

Lönnrot's third edition of ''Kanteletar'' in 1887 had the third book revised in full, as it contained 137 poems. Later editions adhered to the original printing with the exception of 10 poems which were taken from the third book as an [[Addendum|appendix]].

The lyrical poetry of ''Kanteletar'' comes, for the most part, from [[Finnish Karelia]]. In his forward, Lönnrot makes note of [[Lieksa]], [[Ilomantsi]], [[Kitee]], [[Tohmajärvi]], [[Sortavala]], [[Jaakkima]] and [[Kurkijoki]] as places where he traveled. The poems of the third book have generally been collected from Russia and [[Karelia]].

== Reception ==
[[Image:Velisurmaaja.jpg|200p|thumb|Akseli Gallen-Kallela: ''The Fratricide, 1897'']]

''Kanteletar'' and ''Kalevala'' has generally been used as a source of inspiration in [[the arts]]. They have been used as a source of lyrics for Finnish [[folk music]] in addition to archived Finnish folk poetry. The Kalevala-metred poems had originally been sung poetry.

=== Music ===

*[[Mari Kaasinen]] has explained that ''Kanteletar'' and ''Kalevala'' have been used as a source of inspiration for the music of [[Värttinä]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenmanreview.com/cd/interview_marikaasinen_0303.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927180112/http://greenmanreview.com/cd/interview_marikaasinen_0303.html |archivedate=2010-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the lyrics in the Värttinä song ''Niin mie mieltynen'' (The Beloved, Music: P. Lehti – Words: S. Reiman, trad.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Onpa tietty tietyssäni,&lt;br /&gt;
mesimarja mielessäni.&lt;br /&gt;
Lempilintu liitossani,&lt;br /&gt;
soriainen suojassani. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

are taken directly from the 31st poem of the second book. The name of the poem is ''Onpa tietty tietyssäni'' (I Am Thinking of a Particular One) and has been translated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
His image is fastened in my mind&lt;br /&gt;
My sweet one in my memory,&lt;br /&gt;
My little bird flies along with me&lt;br /&gt;
My dear one under my wing.&lt;ref&gt;http://varttina.com/main.site?action=siteupdate/view&amp;id=43 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717185307/http://varttina.com/main.site?action=siteupdate%2Fview&amp;id=43 |date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*[[Akseli Törnudd]] (1874–1923) had written about twenty songs based on ''Kanteletar'' poems, the most popular being perhaps the humorous story about a [[cat]] from [[Viipuri]] ''Tuomittu katti'' ("The Convicted Cat").
*The men's [[choir]] [[Viipurin Lauluveikot]], conducted by [[Urpo Rauhala]], put out the song for the album ''Yhä kohoaa tuttu torni'' and other songs were recorded for their collection ''Te luulette meidän unohtaneen'' in 2005.
*A cappella group [[Rajaton]] has recorded several songs with lyrics taken from ''Kanteletar''.
*''Kanteletar'' has been a source of inspiration for the lyrics of the [[choral]] works by [[Toivo Kuula]], [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Selim Palmgren]].
*In 1996, Finnish metal band [[Amorphis]] released their third album [[Elegy (Amorphis album)|Elegy]] based around the stories and poems within the Kanteletar.

=== Visual art ===

*In addition to his paintings inspired by ''Kalevala'', [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]] produced paintings based on ''Kanteletar'' in the late 19th century.

[[File:Posada2.Catrina.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.35|''La Calavera Catrina'']]
[[File:Calavera_garbancera.png|thumb|[[José Guadalupe Posada|Posada's]] ''La Calavera Garbancera'' in 1913]]
'''''La Calavera Catrina ''''' ('Dapper Skeleton', 'Elegant Skull') or '''''Catrina''''' '''''La Calavera Garbancera''''' is a 1910&amp;ndash;1913 [[zinc]] [[etching]] by the Mexican printmaker, cartoon illustrator and [[lithographer]] [[José Guadalupe Posada]].&lt;ref name="artoftheprint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artoftheprint.com/artistpages/posada_jose_guadalupe_calaveracatrina.htm|title=Jose Guadalupe Posada, Calavera Catrina (Dapper Skeleton)|publisher=ArtofthePrint.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is offered as a satirical portrait of those Mexican natives who, Posada felt, were aspiring to adopt European aristocratic traditions in the pre-revolution era. ''La Catrina'' has become an icon of the Mexican Día de Muertos, or [[Day of the Dead]].

The zinc etching depicts a female skeleton dressed only in a hat, her ''chapeau en attende'' is related to European styles of the early 20th century. The original leaflet describes a person who was ashamed of their indigenous origins and dressed imitating the French style while wearing lots of makeup to make their skin look whiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mexican-folk-art-guide.com/catrina.html|title=La Catrina|work=Copal, Mexican Folk Art at its best Online.|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This description also uses the word ''garbancera'', a nickname given to people of indigenous ancestry who imitated European style and denied their own cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="rockypoint360"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rockypoint360.com/la-catrina-the-woman-of-mexico|title=La Catrina – The woman of Mexico|date=2012-10-30|work=Rocky Point 360|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorklatinculture.com/catrina/|title=Catrina La Calavera Garbancera is the icon of Día de los Muertos|date=2018-09-25|work=New York Latin Culture Magazine|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural importance ==
"La Catrina has become the referential image of Death in Mexico, it is common to see her embodied as part of the celebrations of Day of the Dead throughout the country; she has become a motive for the creation of handcrafts made from clay or other materials, her representations may vary, as well as the hat." – J.G. Posada&lt;ref name="rockypoint360" /&gt;

While the original work by Posada introduced the character, the popularity of La Calavera as well as her name is derived from a work by artist [[Diego Rivera]] in his 1947 completed mural ''[[Sueño de una Tarde Dominical en la Alameda Central]]'' ''(Dream of a Sunday afternoon along Central Alameda)''.

Rivera's mural was painted between the years 1946 and 1947, and is the principal work of the "Museo Mural Diego Rivera" adjacent to the Alameda in the historic center of [[Mexico City]]. It measures 15 meters long and it stood at the end of Alameda Park. The mural survived the 1985 earthquake, which destroyed the hotel, and was later moved across the street to the [[Museo Mural Diego Rivera]], built after the earthquake for the purpose of housing and displaying Rivera's restored mural.&lt;ref name="sfgate" &gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/mexico/mexicomix/article/La-Catrina-Mexico-s-grande-dame-of-death-2318009.php Mexico's grande dame of death]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic subtext ==

=== Image ===
[[File:Chapala181.JPG|thumb|upright|Figures by Michoacan artisan Emilio Barocio Yacobo at the 2015 ''Feria de los Maestros del Arte'' in [[Chapala, Jalisco]]]]
Rivera's mural depicts a culmination of 400 years of Mexico's major figures, which include himself, Posada, and his wife [[Frida Kahlo]]. Rivera took inspiration from the original etching and gave Calavera a body as well as more of an identity in her elegant outfit as she is poised between himself and Posada. The intent seemed to be to show the tradition of welcoming and comfort the Mexicans have with death and especially the identity of a [[Santa Muerte|Lady of the Dead]], harking back to the heritage of the Aztec goddess [[Mictecacihuatl]].  As explained by [[curator]] David de la Torre from the [[LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes]], a [[Mexican-American]] museum and cultural center in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], US, Catrina has come to symbolize not only [[Día de Muertos]] and the Mexican willingness to laugh at death itself, but originally Catrina was an elegant or well-dressed woman, so it refers to rich people,&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt; de la Torre said. "Death brings this neutralizing force; everyone is equal in the end. Sometimes people have to be reminded of that."

=== Culture ===
The culture of La Calavera has ties to political satire and is also a well-kept tradition as the original was inspired by the polarizing reign of dictator [[Porfirio Díaz]]. Díaz is lauded for modernizing and bringing financial stability to Mexico, but he also led his government in repression, corruption, and excess, and had an apparent obsession with European materialism and culture. Christine Delsol writes: "Concentration of fantastic wealth in the hands of the privileged few brewed discontent in the hearts of the suffering many, leading to the 1910 rebellion that toppled Diaz in 1911 and became the Mexican Revolution."&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt;

=== Social Classes ===
She also symbolizes the contrasts between the upper and lower classes, for times were cruel. The social classes were extremely segmented and the highest class was the most fortunate, enjoying many privileges; in contrast, the lower classes were nearly invisible. To explain and rescue the folklore of honoring the memory of those who have passed away, while showing this off to high society, José Guadalupe Posada made caricatures of Death, one of these drawings being the famous Calavera with an elegant hat, though only representing the head and bust with a sophisticated and skeletal essence.&lt;ref name="rockypoint360" /&gt;

== Links to Mesoamerica ==

=== Aztecs ===
The calavera's ties to the past heritage of the Aztecs can be seen in various ways. The indigenous culture of skulls and the death-goddess [[Mictecacihuatl]] is common in [[pre-Columbian art]]. Lady of the Dead, Mictecacihuatl, was keeper of the bones in the underworld, and she presided over the ancient month-long Aztec festivals honoring the dead. Since the [[pre-Columbian era]], Mexican culture has maintained a certain reverence towards death,&lt;ref name="peña"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Araujo Peña |first=Sandra Alejandro |author2=Barbosa Ramírez Marisela |author3=Galván Falcón Susana |author4=García Ortiz Aurea |author5=Uribe Ordaz Carlos |title=El culto a la Santa Muerte: un estudio descriptivo |trans-title=The cult of Santa Muerte:A descriptive study |journal=Revista Psichologia |publisher=Universidad de Londres |location=Mexico City |url=http://www.udlondres.com/revista_psicologia/articulos/stamuerte.htm |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be seen in the widespread commemoration of the [[Day of the Dead]].&lt;ref name="MRamirez"&gt;{{cite news |title='Saint Death' comes to Chicago |first=Margaret |last=Ramirez |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/death-chicago-08,0,2114588.story |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |location=Chicago |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Christian beliefs superimposed on the ancient rituals, those celebrations have evolved into today's Day of the Dead.&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt;

=== Spain ===
As for the Spanish heritage (the death-orientation of the [[monastic orders]], [[Danse Macabre|Dance of Death]], and ''[[memento mori]]'' traditions), it blended with the average Mexican's stoic, but far from humorless, view of death.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It should be noted that some find La Catrina to have closer ties to the Dance of Death than to the possible origins of the calavera in the art of ancient Mesoamerica. La Calavera differs markedly from the rigid sobriety of skulls carved by the Aztec or images of decomposing corpses depicted by the ancient Maya. In prints and various other art forms associated with the Day of the Dead—everything from papier-mâché to papel picado (perforated paper) to sugar and chocolate—images of the calavera are unmistakably humorous. The skeletons, often dressed in finery, move playfully and smile widely. In some ways, these animated figures are much closer visually to the European Dance of Death motif in which limber skeletons lead, lure, or drag unwitting mortals to their ends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learner.org/courses/globalart/work/124/index.html Global art]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
Though these interpretations seem to ignore the full relationship that the Mexicans have with death, as well as the macabre humor that ties to the cycle of life, death and ceremony that the Aztecs had, it should be understood that few countries pay homage to death the way Mexico does; offerings, songs, respect and humor are all common Mexican expressions towards death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://celebra.aollatino.com/2010/11/01/what-does-death-mean-for-mexicans/ What does death mean for Mexicans]&lt;/ref&gt; The European ties are there both for comic effect as well as depicting the symbolic shell that Europe cloaked Mesoamerica in, but the native bones still lie within.

== Folk art ==

=== Purist ===
La Calavera Catrina today can be found in her more traditional form both in drawn works as well as sculptures made out of Oaxacan wood carvings, papier-mâché sculptures, majolica pottery, and [[Barro negro pottery|Barro negro black clay pottery]]. She is also coupled with male skeletons.

== Costume ==
Dressing as a "Catrina" is a popular costume in [[Day of the Dead]] celebrations in Mexico. Catrinas typically feature "[[Calavera#Face painting|sugar skull]]" make-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allure.com/story/dia-de-los-muertos-makeup-tradition|title=5 Things to Know Before Doing Dia de Los Muertos Makeup|last=Devash|first=Meirav|work=Allure|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* Works such as the screen print ''Sun Maid'' (''Raisins'') by [[Ester Hernandez|Ester Hernández]] in the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] show the influence of Posada's earlier vision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://americanart.si.edu/education/corazon/galeria_06.cfm Sun Mad, Ester Hernández, [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The same might be said of the cover for [[Los Lobos]]' album ''[[La pistola y el corazón]]'', which depicts a pistol toting Catrina in a couple's embrace.

* A character based on La Calavera appears as a protagonist in the 2014 computer-animated film ''[[The Book of Life (2014 film)|The Book of Life]]'', where she is named "[[Santa Muerte|La Muerte]]" and is the queen of the deceased who are remembered by the living. She is referred to in the Latin American Spanish dub as "La Catrina".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2262227/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv |title=The Book of Life (2014 film), Trivia |publisher=[[IMDb.com]] |quote=In the Spanish dubbing of the movie, La Muerte is called "La Catrina", this is obviously "Posada's Catrina" a popular iconic skeletal lady that has become associated with the festivities of the Día de Muertos. Her main attribute is a gorgeous hat. In the movie, the modern Mexican icon (La Catrina) and the classic icon (Lady Death), are fused in a single role as the ancient Mayan goddess of death, ruling over one of the lands of the dead.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See footnote.''

* Two educational video series, ''La Calavera'' and ''La Calavera: El úlitmo secreto'', were filmed in Mexico by [[Pearson Education]], and include various program components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PS1lMm&amp;PMDBSOLUTIONID=6724&amp;PMDBSITEID=2781&amp;PMDBCATEGORYID=811&amp;PMDBSUBSOLUTIONID=&amp;PMDBSUBJECTAREAID=&amp;PMDBSUBCATEGORYID=23498&amp;PMDbProgramId=6142&amp;elementType=programComponents La Catrina, Program Components, Pearson Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Both videos integrate language proficiency with culture, and follow the journey of Jamie González as she searches for the secrets of her mysterious great-grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PS1lMm&amp;PMDbSiteId=2781&amp;PMDbSolutionId=6724&amp;PMDbSubSolutionId=&amp;PMDbCategoryId=811&amp;PMDbSubCategoryId=23498&amp;PMDbSubjectAreaId=&amp;PMDbProgramId=6142 La Catrina, Overview, Pearson Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the [[MMORPG]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', during the first and second days of November, a Day of the Dead Celebration is held among the largest Capital Cities of the game. Each city has a Calavera, represented as a dancing female undead NPC dressed in a mariachi outfit. If the player dances with her, his or her player character will also take the appearance of an undead character with a similar outfit.

* In the ''[[Pathfinder Roleplaying Game]]'', creatures called Calaveras painlessly welcome into the afterlife those who cannot accept death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/863052391|title=Pathfinder roleplaying game : Bestiary 4|last=Stephen.|first=Radney-MacFarland,|last2=K.|first2=Reynolds, Sean|last3=Dennis.|first3=Baker,|last4=Alexandur.|first4=Alexandrov,|last5=Jason.|first5=Bulmahn,|last6=Gary.|first6=Gygax,|last7=1947-2009.|first7=Arneson, Dave,|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Paizo Pub|isbn=9781601255754|oclc=863052391}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are similar in appearance to La Catrina, wearing a festive dress and carrying a bouquet of flowers.

* The video game ''[[Need for Speed: Payback]]'' features a crew leader by the name of "La Catrina" as the leader of her crew "Graveyard shift" and one of the first bosses you encounter. Her motto says "When you ride a Hundred Miles an hour, Every decision is Life and Death".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ea.com/games/need-for-speed/need-for-speed-payback/street-leagues/graveyard-shift?cid=37302&amp;ts=1507434703836&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4924">'''Madeleine Strindberg''' (born 1955)&lt;ref name=yourpaintings&gt;{{Art UK bio|retrieved=24 January 2014|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a German-born painter, winner of the 1998 [[Jerwood Painting Prize]].&lt;ref name="thrown out"&gt;{{cite news|author= |title =Artist thrown out of studio for not being there often enough |work=[[Evening Standard]] |publisher= |date=17 October 2011 |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/artist-thrown-out-of-studio-for-not-being-there-often-enough-6454236.html |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Strindberg graduated from the [[Byam Shaw School of Art]] and [[Royal College of Art]] in 1985 with a master's degree in Painting.&lt;ref name="Madeleine Strindberg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Madeleine Strindberg|url=http://www.saatchionline.com/madeleine-strindberg|publisher=Saatchi Art|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Work==
Strindberg won the Barclays Bank Award in 1985. She was the Artist in Residence at the [[National Gallery]] in 1989. That same year she also won the GLC Peace Prize. In 1996, she was awarded the Abbey Award in Painting by the [[British School at Rome]]. She was one of the artists shortlisted for the [[John Moores Painting Prize]] in 1997. In 2000, she was once again on the shortlist for the Charles Wollaston Award.&lt;ref name="Madeleine Strindberg" /&gt;

Preferring to be called an artist as opposed to a painter, Strindberg works with various media. She uses 3-dimensional objects, photography and video, as well as the written word to convey her subject matter. Painting remains her most frequent medium. She uses a lot of unusual materials in her work, from newspaper cuttings to pages from scientific textbooks to her own writings.&lt;ref name=Strindberg&gt;{{cite web|title=Madeleine Strindberg|url=http://arts.brighton.ac.uk/staff/madeleine-strindberg|publisher=University of Brighton Faculty of Arts|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Exhibitions==
Strindberg has held numerous exhibitions. Her exhibitions explored various themes. Her exhibition “Just Look at Yourself!” portrayed the psychologically charged internal world. Another unique work was “Central Nervous System”. Her “Among the Believers” was a strong political statement on the occupation of Iraq.&lt;ref name=Strindberg /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Style==
Strindberg's work is somewhere between [[expressionism]] and grunge [[minimalism]]. Her work is not one that can be seen as belonging to one particular. Rather it is ceaseless striving to attain meaning through unusual and experimental means.&lt;ref name=Strindberg /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Awards==
She was chosen from over 1200 artists to win the Jerwood Painting Prize in 1998, for her delicate paintings which explored aspects of the human body.&lt;ref name="Jerwood 98"&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Jerwood Painting Prize 1998|publisher=Jerwood Space website|date=|url=http://www.jerwoodspace.co.uk/documents/GALLERYJerwoodPaintingPrize1998.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=24 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208020932/http://www.jerwoodspace.co.uk/documents/GALLERYJerwoodPaintingPrize1998.pdf|archivedate=8 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has subsequently used [[MRI]] sections through the human brain to create her abstract works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Siân Ede |title=Art and Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iiE3RsvK248C&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=Madeleine+Strindberg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CMXjUtC3I-am0AXx3oCwBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Madeleine%20Strindberg&amp;f=false |place=London |publisher=I. B. Tauris |page=138 |year=2005 |isbn=1-85043-584-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of her oil paintings are in UK public collections (including the Jerwood Collection).&lt;ref name=yourpaintings /&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1980 Strindberg married [[Charles Boyle (poet)|Charles Boyle]], a poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|editor1=Jeremy Noel-Tod |editor2=Ian Hamilton |title=The Oxford Companion to Modern Poetry in English |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZKcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=Madeleine+Strindberg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CMXjUtC3I-am0AXx3oCwBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Madeleine%20Strindberg&amp;f=false |place= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=65 |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-964025-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Strindberg has lived in London, UK, for most of her life and worked from a studio in [[Bow, London|Bow]] for 25 years.&lt;ref name="thrown out" /&gt; She suffers from [[multiple sclerosis]] and, in 2011, was forced out of the studio by the landlord for not using it enough.&lt;ref name="thrown out" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5349">'''The Magdalena Project''' is an international network of women in contemporary [[theatre]] and [[performance]]. It aims to increase awareness of women's contributions to theatre and to create the artistic and economic structures and support networks to enable women to work.

==Background==

The idea for a network of women theatre practitioners was born in a café in [[Trevignano]], Italy in September 1983, during a festival of alternative theatre: a discussion on the predominance of male directors and writers at the festival led Jill Greenhalgh to ask what such a festival might be like if the primary creative voices were those of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bassnett |first=Susan |authorlink= |title=Magdalena: International Women's Experimental Theatre |origyear=1989 |year=1989 |publisher=Berg Publishers Limited |location=Oxford |isbn=0-85496-016-3 |pages=19–20 |chapter=The Birth of Magdalena}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by this, Greenhalgh organised MAGDALENA '86 - The First International Festival of Women in Contemporary Theatre, in [[Cardiff]], Wales in August 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fry |first=Chris |authorlink= |title=The Way of Magdalena |origyear=2007 |year=2007 |publisher=The Open Page Publications |location=Denmark |isbn=978-87-87292-13-9 |pages=33–51 |chapter=Magdalena '86}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at this event the Magdalena Project was founded.

From then until 1999, The Magdalena Project operated from an administrative base in Cardiff, with a board of advisors and Greenhalgh as its artistic director. During this period the Magdalena Project produced performances, organised workshops and festival gatherings in Europe and published a regular newsletter.

In 1988, women theatre practitioners in Latin America became involved, organising meetings in Peru, Colombia and Uruguay, and extending the network to Chile and Argentina with further meetings in 1993. This was to be the beginning of growing interest in the Project from around the world, with affiliate groups forming and hosting festivals and events in many countries.

In 1999, the [[Arts Council of Wales|Welsh Arts Council]] ceased its infrastructure funding of the Magdalena Project, necessitating the closure of the Cardiff office and the cessation of most cost-bearing activities. However, by this time the network was strongly established at an international level, and was about to launch its web site and email list. The move into online communications ensured the continuation of the network despite the loss of funding.

==International Festivals and Affiliate Groups==

The international membership of the Magdalena Project network is made up of individuals (men and women), theatre companies and organisations; in some locations affiliate Magdalena groups have been formally established. These groups are autonomous and all of their activities are organised and funded locally.

The Latin American network has been operating since 1988 with festivals in Argentina (1999, 2003), Colombia (2002, 2006), Cuba (2005, 2008), Peru (2006) and Brasil (2008). In Argentina, the network has operated under the name Magdalena 2nd Generacion since 1999.

In 1997 Magdalena Aotearoa was officially established in New Zealand and an international festival of women’s performance was held there in 1999. Other festivals outside Europe were held in Australia (2003), USA (2005) and Singapore (2006). The Transit Festival of Women’s Performance is held approximately every three years at [[Odin Teatret]], Denmark, organised by Julia Varley, one of the founders of the Magdalena Project. Other companies and festivals that are connected to the Magdalena Project include [[Grenland Friteater]], Teatro delle Radici, AMAR, DAH Teater, Voix de Femmes, Voix Polyphoniques, Teatret OM, [[Double Edge]] and others.

'''Mahmoud Hammad''' (born 1923 in [[Jarabulus]], [[Syria]]) is a Syrian [[Painting|painter]] and pioneer of modern Syrian art

==Life and career==
He studied art at the [[Accademia di belle arti di Roma]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accademiabelleartiroma.it/|title=Accademia Di Belle Arti Di Roma}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1953 and 1957. He focused on the art of engraving and especially the art medals. After completing his studies he returned to [[Damascus]] in 1960 and taught as professor at the Fine Arts Faculty of Damascus since its creation. From 1970 until 1980, he became dean at the Fine Arts Faculty of Damascus.&lt;ref name="Sothebys"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mahmoud Hammad 'DAD' (LETTER D)|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.51.html/2015/contemporary-art-doha-do1501|website=Sothebys|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, he started exhibiting his work throughout most Arab countries, Europe and the United States. In 1948, he received first prize in Arts in Damascus Exhibition, in 1957, first prize at the competition of the city of Naples, and in 1959, first prize at the competition of Ministry of Culture in United Arab Republic. In his work, Hammad uses the geometry of elementary forms to express the dynamic spirit of the Arabic letter. Among circles, squares, rectangles, determined by the color, the letter appears with liberty to end a profound silence.

His work has been shown in exhibitions at museums such as the [[Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/nafas/articles/2003/modern_art_from_the_arab_world|title=Modern Art from the Arab World  |last=Ali|first=Wijdan|date=December 2003|publisher=Nafas art magazine|accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married to [[Derrie Fakhoury]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Work==
Hammad uses Arabic phrases in abstract compositions. He interweaves the letters to create a mass of geometric forms.  He tries to use forms that are familiar in  Islamic culture.  This use of Arabic calligraphy as a graphic form places him within the ''Hurufiyah Art Movement.'' &lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian, [[Wijdan Ali]] describes his style of painting as 'Abstract Calligraphy' within the Hurufiyya movement. &lt;ref&gt; Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1325">The '''Mandgelis Document''' or '''Mandgelis Letter''' was a letter in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] dated [[Anno Mundi|AM]] [[Hebrew calendar|4746]] (985–986). It refers to "our lord [[David of Taman|David]], the [[Khazar]] prince" who lived in [[Taman peninsula|Taman]]. The letter said that this David was visited by envoys from [[Kievan Rus]] to ask about religious matters. This consultation may have been connected to the conversion of [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] which took place during roughly the same time period. Taman was a principality of Kievan Rus around 988, so this [[succession of states|successor state]] (if that is what it was) may have been conquered altogether. The authenticity of this letter has however been questioned by such scholars as [[D. M. Dunlop]], as it passed through the hands of [[Abraham Firkovich]], who on occasion is known to have forged documents and inscriptions.

== Inauguration ==
Mangal Mahadev Monument was inaugurated in 2007 and the "Sthapan" was done during the Maha Shivratri period of 2008. It is considered the most sacred [[Hindu]] place in Mauritius.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsonline.org/album/Mauritius/slides/Grand%20Bassin.html Bird's eye view] Retrieved on 5 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; There are temples dedicated to other Gods including [[Durga]], [[Hanuman]], [[Lakshmi]] and [[Ganesh]] around the Shiva Temple and Mangal Mahadev statue on the banks of the Grand Bassin. During [[Shivaratri]], many pilgrims in Mauritius walk bare feet from their homes to the lake and pray at the feet of the sculpture.

'''Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɑː|k|ˈ|t|iː|n|,_|b|ɑː|x|-}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bakhtin "Bakhtin"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ru|Михаи́л Миха́йлович Бахти́н}}, {{IPA-ru|mʲɪxɐˈil mʲɪˈxajləvʲɪtɕ bɐxˈtʲin|pron}}; {{OldStyleDate|16 November|1895|4 November}} – 7 March&lt;ref&gt;Gary Saul Morson and Caryl Emerson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BViC_wkbd4oC&amp;dq= ''Mikhail Bakhtin: Creation of a Prosaics''], Stanford University Press, 1990, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; 1975) was a [[Russian people|Russian]] [[philosopher]], [[literary critic]], [[semiotician]]&lt;ref&gt;Maranhão 1990, p.197&lt;/ref&gt; and scholar who worked on [[literary theory]], ethics, and the [[philosophy of language]]. His writings, on a variety of subjects, inspired scholars working in a number of different traditions ([[Marxism]], [[semiotics]], [[structuralism]], religious criticism) and in disciplines as diverse as literary criticism, history, philosophy, sociology, anthropology and psychology. Although Bakhtin was active in the debates on aesthetics and literature that took place in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1920s, his distinctive position did not become well known until he was rediscovered by Russian scholars in the 1960s.

== Early life ==
{{Semiotics}}
Bakhtin was born in [[Oryol]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], to an old family of the nobility. His father was the manager of a bank and worked in several cities. For this reason Bakhtin spent his early childhood years in Oryol, in [[Vilnius]], and then in [[Odessa]], where in 1913 he joined the historical and philological faculty at the local university (the [[Odessa University]]). Katerina Clark and Michael Holquist write: "Odessa..., like Vilnius, was an appropriate setting for a chapter in the life of a man who was to become the philosopher of [[heteroglossia]] and [[Carnivalesque|carnival]]. The same sense of fun and irreverence that gave birth to [[Isaak Babel|Babel]]'s Rabelaisian gangster or to the tricks and deceptions of [[Ostap Bender]], the [[picaro]] created by [[Ilf and Petrov]], left its mark on Bakhtin."&lt;ref&gt;Katerina Clark and Michael Holquist, ''Mikhail Bakhtin'' (Harvard University Press, 1984: {{ISBN|0-674-57417-6}}), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He later transferred to [[Petrograd Imperial University]] to join his brother Nikolai. It is here that Bakhtin was greatly influenced by the classicist [[Tadeusz Stefan Zieliński|F. F. Zelinsky]], whose works contain the beginnings of concepts elaborated by Bakhtin.

== Career ==
Bakhtin completed his studies in 1918. He then moved to a small city in western Russia, [[Nevel (town)|Nevel]] ([[Pskov Oblast]]), where he worked as a schoolteacher for two years. It was at that time that the first "[[Bakhtin Circle]]" formed. The group consisted of intellectuals with varying interests, but all shared a love for the discussion of literary, religious, and political topics. Included in this group were [[Valentin Voloshinov]] and, eventually, [[P. N. Medvedev]], who joined the group later in [[Vitebsk]]. Vitebsk was “a cultural centre of the region” the perfect place for Bakhtin “and other intellectuals [to organize] lectures, debates and concerts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/49580/Mikhail-Bakhtin |title=Mikhail Bakhtin (Russian philosopher and literary critic) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1975-03-07 |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; German philosophy was the topic talked about most frequently and, from this point forward, Bakhtin considered himself more a philosopher than a literary scholar. It was in Nevel, also, that Bakhtin worked tirelessly on a large work concerning moral philosophy that was never published in its entirety. However, in 1919, a short section of this work was published and given the title "Art and Responsibility". This piece constitutes Bakhtin's first published work. Bakhtin relocated to Vitebsk in 1920. It was here, in 1921, that Bakhtin married Elena Aleksandrovna Okolovich. Later, in 1923, Bakhtin was diagnosed with [[osteomyelitis]], a bone disease that ultimately led to the amputation of his leg in 1938. This illness hampered his productivity and rendered him an invalid.&lt;ref name="politru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polit.ru/news/2014/11/17/bakhtin/|title=Мемория. Михаил Бахтин|publisher=polit.ru|language=Russian|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Circulo_de_bajtin_1924.JPG|thumb|left|Bakhtin Circle, Leningrad, 1924-26.]]
In 1924, Bakhtin moved to [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], where he assumed a position at the Historical Institute and provided consulting services for the State Publishing House. It is at this time that Bakhtin decided to share his work with the public, but just before "On the Question of the Methodology of Aesthetics in Written Works" was to be published, the journal in which it was to appear stopped publication. This work was eventually published 51 years later. The repression and misplacement of his manuscripts was something that would plague Bakhtin throughout his career. In 1929, "Problems of Dostoevsky’s Art", Bakhtin's first major work, was published. It is here that Bakhtin introduces the concept of [[dialogism]]. However, just as this book was introduced, on 8 December 1928, right before Voskresenie's 10th anniversary, Meyer, Bakhtin and a number of others associated with Voskresenie were apprehended by the Soviet secret police, the [[Joint State Political Directorate|OGPU]] (Hirschkop 1999: p.&amp;nbsp;168), the leaders being sentenced up to ten years in labor camps of [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]], though after an appeal to consider the state of his health his sentence was commuted to exile to [[Kazakhstan]], where he and his wife spent six years in [[Kostanay|Kustanai]] (now Kostanay), after which in 1936 they moved to [[Saransk]] (then in [[Mordovian ASSR]], now the Republic of [[Mordovia]]) where he taught at the [[Mordovian State University|Mordovian Pedagogical Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, D. J. (2013). Bakhtin reframed. London: I.B. Tauris.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encspb.ru/object/2804015084?lc=en&lt;/ref&gt;

During the six years he spent working as a book-keeper in the town of [[Kustanai]] he wrote several important essays, including "Discourse in the Novel". In 1936, living in [[Saransk]], he became an obscure figure in a provincial college, dropping out of view and teaching only occasionally. In 1937, Bakhtin moved to [[Kimry]], a town located one hundred kilometers from Moscow. Here, Bakhtin completed work on a book concerning the 18th-century German novel which was subsequently accepted by the Sovetskii Pisatel' Publishing House. However, the only copy of the manuscript disappeared during the upheaval caused by the German invasion.

After the amputation of his leg in 1938, Bakhtin's health improved and he became more prolific. In 1940, and until the end of [[World War II]], Bakhtin lived in Moscow, where he submitted a dissertation on [[François Rabelais]] to the [[Gorky Institute of World Literature]] to obtain a postgraduate title,&lt;ref&gt;Holquist ''Dialogism: Bakhtin and His World'' p.10&lt;/ref&gt; a dissertation that could not be defended until the war ended. In 1946 and 1949, the defense of this dissertation divided the scholars of Moscow into two groups: those official opponents guiding the defense, who accepted the original and unorthodox manuscript, and those other professors who were against the manuscript's acceptance. The book's earthy, anarchic topic was the cause of many arguments that ceased only when the government intervened. Ultimately, Bakhtin was denied a [[Higher doctorate|higher doctoral degree]] ([[Doctor of Sciences]]) and granted a lesser degree ([[Candidate of Sciences]], a [[research doctorate]]) by the State Accrediting Bureau. Later, Bakhtin was invited back to Saransk, where he took on the position of chair of the General Literature Department at the Mordovian Pedagogical Institute. When, in 1957, the Institute changed from a teachers' college to a university, Bakhtin became head of the Department of Russian and World Literature. In 1961, Bakhtin's deteriorating health forced him to retire, and in 1969, in search of medical attention, Bakhtin moved back to Moscow, where he lived until his death in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xxi-xxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakhtin's works and ideas gained popularity after his death, and he endured difficult conditions for much of his professional life, a time in which information was often seen as dangerous and therefore often hidden. As a result, the details provided now are often of uncertain accuracy. Also contributing to the imprecision of these details is the limited access to Russian archival information during Bakhtin's life. It is only after the archives became public that scholars realized that much of what they thought they knew about the details of Bakhtin's life was false or skewed largely by Bakhtin himself.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschkop 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works and ideas ==

=== ''Toward a Philosophy of the Act'' ===
''Toward a Philosophy of the Act'' was first published in the USSR in 1986 with the title ''K filosofii postupka''. The manuscript, written between 1919–1921, was found in bad condition with pages missing and sections of text that were illegible. Consequently, this philosophical essay appears today as a fragment of an unfinished work. ''Toward a Philosophy of the Act'' comprises only an introduction, of which the first few pages are missing, and part one of the full text. However, Bakhtin's intentions for the work were not altogether lost, for he provided an outline in the introduction in which he stated that the essay was to contain four parts.&lt;ref&gt;Liapunov xvii&lt;/ref&gt; The first part of the essay deals with the analysis of the performed acts or deeds that comprise the actual world; "the world actually experienced, and not the merely thinkable world." For the three subsequent and unfinished parts of ''Toward a Philosophy of the Act'' Bakhtin states the topics he intends to discuss. He outlines that the second part will deal with aesthetic activity and the ethics of artistic creation; the third with the ethics of politics; and the fourth with religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 54&lt;/ref&gt;

''Toward a Philosophy of the Act'' reveals a young Bakhtin who is in the process of developing his moral philosophy by decentralizing the work of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. This text is one of Bakhtin's early works concerning [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]] and it is here that Bakhtin lays out three claims regarding the acknowledgment of the uniqueness of one's participation in Being:
# I both actively and passively participate in Being.
# My uniqueness is given but it simultaneously exists only to the degree to which I actualize this uniqueness (in other words, it is in the performed act and deed that has yet to be achieved).
# Because I am actual and irreplaceable I must actualize my uniqueness.

Bakhtin further states: "It is in relation to the whole actual unity that my unique thought arises from my unique place in Being."&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 41&lt;/ref&gt; Bakhtin deals with the concept of morality whereby he attributes the predominating legalistic notion of morality to human moral action. According to Bakhtin, the I cannot maintain neutrality toward moral and ethical demands which manifest themselves as one's voice of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschkop 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

It is here also that Bakhtin introduces an "architectonic" or [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]tic model of the human psyche which consists of three components: "I-for-myself", "I-for-the-other", and "other-for-me". The I-for-myself is an unreliable source of identity, and Bakhtin argues that it is the I-for-the-other through which human beings develop a sense of identity because it serves as an amalgamation of the way in which others view me. Conversely, other-for-me describes the way in which others incorporate my perceptions of them into their own identities. Identity, as Bakhtin describes it here, does not belong merely to the individual, rather it is shared by all.&lt;ref&gt;Emerson and Morson 184-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics'': polyphony and unfinalizability &lt;!--linked from 'Fabula and syuzhet'--&gt; ===
During his time in Leningrad, Bakhtin shifted his view away from the philosophy characteristic of his early works and towards the notion of dialogue. It is at this time that he began his engagement with the work of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]. ''Problems of Dostoevsky’s Art'' is considered to be Bakhtin's seminal work, a work in which Bakhtin introduces three important concepts.

The first concept is the unfinalizable self: individual people cannot be finalized, completely understood, known, or labeled. Though it is possible to understand people and to treat them as if they are completely known, Bakhtin's conception of '''unfinalizability''' considers the possibility that a person can change, and that a person is never fully revealed or fully known in the world. Readers may find that this conception reflects the idea of the "soul"; Bakhtin had strong roots in [[Christianity]] and in the [[Neo-Kantian]] school led by [[Hermann Cohen]], both of which emphasized the importance of an individual's potentially infinite capability, worth, and the hidden soul.

Second is the idea of the relationship between the self and others, or other groups. According to Bakhtin, every person is influenced by others in an inescapably intertwined way, and consequently no voice can be said to be isolated. In an interview with the [[Novy Mir]] Editorial Staff ('Response to a Question from Novy Mir Editorial Staff'), Bakhtin once explained that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to understand, it is immensely important for the person who understands to be located outside the object of his or her creative understanding—in time, in space, in culture. For one cannot even really see one's own exterior and comprehend it as a whole, and no mirrors or photographs can help; our real exterior can be seen and understood only by other people, because they are located outside us in space, and because they are others.
~''New York Review of Books'', June 10, 1993.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, Bakhtin's philosophy greatly respected the influences of others on the self, not merely in terms of how a person comes to be, but also in how a person thinks and how a person sees him- or herself truthfully.

Third, Bakhtin found a true representation of "[[polyphony (literature)|polyphony]]" (i.e. many voices) in Dostoevsky's work. According to Dostoevsky, each character represents a voice that speaks for an individual self, distinct from others. This idea of polyphony is related to the concepts of unfinalizability and self-and-others, since it is the unfinalizability of individuals that creates true polyphony.

Bakhtin briefly outlined the polyphonic concept of truth. He criticized the assumption that, if two people disagree, at least one of them must be in error. He challenged philosophers for whom plurality of minds is accidental and superfluous. For Bakhtin, truth is not a statement, a sentence or a phrase. Instead, understanding is a number of mutually addressed, albeit contradictory and logically inconsistent, statements. Understanding needs a multitude of carrying voices. It cannot be held within a single mind, or be expressed by "a single mouth". The polyphonic truth requires many simultaneous voices. Bakhtin does not mean to say that many voices carry partial truths that complement each other. A number of different voices do not make the truth if simply "averaged" or "synthesized". Rather, it is the fact of mutual addressivity, of engagement, and of commitment to the context of a real-life event, that distinguishes understanding from misunderstanding.

After Bakhtin's ''Problems of Dostoevsky’s Art (1929)'' was translated into English and published in the West, a chapter on the concept of "carnival" was added to the book which was published with the slightly different title, ''Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics (1984)''. According to Bakhtin, ''carnival'' is the context in which distinct individual voices are heard, flourish and interact together. The carnival creates the "threshold" situations where regular conventions are broken or reversed and genuine dialogue becomes possible. The notion of a carnival was Bakhtin's way of describing Dostoevsky's polyphonic style: each individual character is strongly defined, and at the same time the reader witnesses the critical influence of each character upon the other. That is to say, the voices of others are heard by each individual, and each inescapably shapes the character of the other.

=== ''Rabelais and His World'': carnival and grotesque ===
{{Main article|Rabelais and His World}}
During World War II Bakhtin submitted a dissertation on the French Renaissance writer [[François Rabelais]] which was not defended until some years later. The controversial ideas discussed within the work caused much disagreement, and it was consequently decided that Bakhtin be denied his [[higher doctorate]]. Thus, due to its content, ''Rabelais and Folk Culture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance'' was not published until 1965, at which time it was given the title ''[[Rabelais and His World]]''&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xxv&lt;/ref&gt; (Russian: Творчество Франсуа Рабле и народная культура средневековья и Ренессанса, ''Tvorčestvo Fransua Rable i narodnaja kul'tura srednevekov'ja i Renessansa'').
	
In ''Rabelais and His World'', a classic of Renaissance studies, Bakhtin concerns himself with the openness of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel''; however, the book itself also serves as an example of such openness. Throughout the text, Bakhtin attempts two things: he seeks to recover sections of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'' that, in the past, were either ignored or suppressed, and conducts an analysis of the [[Renaissance]] social system in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language that was not. It is by means of this analysis that Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts: the first is ''carnival'' ([[carnivalesque]]) which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and the second is ''[[grotesque body|grotesque realism]]'' which is defined as a literary mode. Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'' Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body and the material bodily lower stratum.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 297-299&lt;/ref&gt;

In his chapter on the history of laughter, Bakhtin advances the notion of its therapeutic and liberating force, arguing that "laughing truth ... degraded power".&lt;ref&gt;Iswolsky 1965, p. 92f.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Dialogic Imagination'': chronotope and heteroglossia &lt;!--linked from 'Fabula and syuzhet'--&gt; ===
''The Dialogic Imagination'' (first published as a whole in 1975) is a compilation of four essays concerning language and the essay: "[[Epic and Novel]]" (1941), "From the Prehistory of Novelistic Discourse" (1940), "Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel" (1937–1938), and "Discourse in the Novel" (1934–1935). It is through the essays contained within ''The Dialogic Imagination'' that Bakhtin introduces the concepts of ''[[heteroglossia]]'', ''[[dialogism]]'' and ''[[chronotope]]'', making a significant contribution to the realm of literary scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; Bakhtin explains the generation of meaning through the "primacy of context over text" (heteroglossia), the hybrid nature of language ([[polyglossia]]) and the relation between [[utterance]]s ([[intertextuality]]).&lt;ref&gt;Maranhão 1990, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wertsch98"&gt;[[James V. Wertsch]] (1998) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=73Vv7Y3vf14C Mind As Action]''&lt;/ref&gt; Heteroglossia is "the base condition governing the operation of meaning in any [[utterance]]."&lt;ref name="Wertsch98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holquist and Emerson 1981, p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; To make an utterance means to "appropriate the words of others and populate them with one's own intention."&lt;ref name="Wertsch98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin&lt;/ref&gt; Bakhtin's deep insights on dialogicality represent a substantive shift from views on the nature of language and knowledge by major thinkers such as [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;Holquist, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bakcult8"&gt;{{citation|last1=Hirschkop|first1=Ken|last2=Shepherd|first2=David G|title=Bakhtin and cultural theory|page=8|isbn=978-0-7190-2615-7|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|year=1989|accessdate=2011-04-26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCO8AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=Bakhtin%20Saussure%20Kant&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}} Unlike Kant, Bakhtin positions aesthetic activity and experience over abstraction. Bakhtin also clashes with Saussure's view of "langue is a 'social fact'", since Bakhtin views Saussure's society as a "disturbing homogenous collective"&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Epic and Novel", Bakhtin demonstrates the novel's distinct nature by contrasting it with the [[Epic poetry|epic]]. By doing so, Bakhtin shows that the novel is well-suited to the post-industrial civilization in which we live because it flourishes on diversity. It is this same diversity that the epic attempts to eliminate from the world. According to Bakhtin, the novel as a genre is unique in that it is able to embrace, ingest, and devour other genres while still maintaining its status as a novel. Other genres, however, cannot emulate the novel without damaging their own distinct identity.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

"From the Prehistory of Novelistic Discourse" is a less traditional essay in which Bakhtin reveals how various different texts from the past have ultimately come together to form the modern novel.&lt;ref name="Holquist81xxxiii"&gt;Holquist 1981, p. xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

"Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel" introduces Bakhtin's concept of [[chronotope]]. This essay applies the concept in order to further demonstrate the distinctive quality of the novel.&lt;ref name="Holquist81xxxiii" /&gt; The word ''chronotope'' literally means "time space" (a concept he refers to that of Einstein) and is defined by Bakhtin as "the intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in literature."&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 84&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of his writing, an author must create entire worlds and, in doing so, is forced to make use of the organizing categories of the real world in which he lives. For this reason ''chronotope'' is a concept that engages reality.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 278&lt;/ref&gt;

The final essay, "Discourse in the Novel", is one of Bakhtin's most complete statements concerning his philosophy of language. It is here that Bakhtin provides a model for a history of discourse and introduces the concept of heteroglossia.&lt;ref name="Holquist81xxxiii" /&gt; The term ''heteroglossia'' refers to the qualities of a language that are extralinguistic, but common to all languages. These include qualities such as perspective, evaluation, and ideological positioning. In this way most languages are incapable of neutrality, for every word is inextricably bound to the context in which it exists.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Speech Genres and Other Late Essays'' ===
In ''Speech Genres and Other Late Essays'' Bakhtin moves away from the novel and concerns himself with the problems of method and the nature of culture. There are six essays that comprise this compilation: "Response to a Question from the ''Novy Mir'' Editorial Staff", "The ''Bildungsroman'' and Its Significance in the History of Realism", "The Problem of Speech Genres", "The Problem of the Text in Linguistics, Philology, and the Human Sciences: An Experiment in Philosophical Analysis", "From Notes Made in 1970-71," and "Toward a Methodology for the Human Sciences."

"Response to a Question from the ''Novy Mir'' Editorial Staff" is a transcript of comments made by Bakhtin to a reporter from a monthly journal called ''[[Novy Mir]]'' that was widely read by Soviet intellectuals. The transcript expresses Bakhtin's opinion of literary scholarship whereby he highlights some of its shortcomings and makes suggestions for improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' and Its Significance in the History of [[Literary realism|Realism]]" is a fragment from one of Bakhtin's lost books. The publishing house to which Bakhtin had submitted the full manuscript was blown up during the German invasion and Bakhtin was in possession of only the prospectus. However, due to a shortage of paper, Bakhtin began using this remaining section to roll cigarettes. So only a portion of the opening section remains. This remaining section deals primarily with [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Problem of Speech [[Genre]]s" deals with the difference between Saussurean [[linguistics]] and language as a living dialogue (translinguistics). In a relatively short space, this essay takes up a topic about which Bakhtin had planned to write a book, making the essay a rather dense and complex read. It is here that Bakhtin distinguishes between literary and everyday language. According to Bakhtin, genres exist not merely in language, but rather in communication. In dealing with genres, Bakhtin indicates that they have been studied only within the realm of [[rhetoric]] and [[literature]], but each discipline draws largely on genres that exist outside both rhetoric and literature. These extraliterary genres have remained largely unexplored. Bakhtin makes the distinction between primary genres and secondary genres, whereby primary genres legislate those words, phrases, and expressions that are acceptable in everyday life, and secondary genres are characterized by various types of text such as legal, scientific, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Problem of the Text in Linguistics, Philology, and the Human Sciences: An Experiment in Philosophical Analysis" is a compilation of the thoughts Bakhtin recorded in his notebooks. These notes focus mostly on the problems of the text, but various other sections of the paper discuss topics he has taken up elsewhere, such as speech genres, the status of the author, and the distinct nature of the human sciences. However, "The Problem of the Text" deals primarily with dialogue and the way in which a text relates to its context. Speakers, Bakhtin claims, shape an utterance according to three variables: the object of discourse, the immediate addressee, and a ''superaddressee''. This is what Bakhtin describes as the tertiary nature of dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xvii-xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

"From Notes Made in 1970-71" appears also as a collection of fragments extracted from notebooks Bakhtin kept during the years of 1970 and 1971. It is here that Bakhtin discusses interpretation and its endless possibilities. According to Bakhtin, humans have a habit of making narrow interpretations, but such limited interpretations only serve to weaken the richness of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final essay, "Toward a Methodology for the Human Sciences", originates from notes Bakhtin wrote during the mid-seventies and is the last piece of writing Bakhtin produced before he died. In this essay he makes a distinction between dialectic and dialogics and comments on the difference between the text and the aesthetic object. It is here also, that Bakhtin differentiates himself from the [[Formalism (literature)|Formalists]], who, he felt, underestimated the importance of content while oversimplifying change, and the [[Structuralism|Structuralists]], who too rigidly adhered to the concept of "code."&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xx-xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disputed texts ==
Some of the works which bear the names of Bakhtin's close friends [[V. N. Vološinov]] and [[P. N. Medvedev]] have been attributed to Bakhtin – particularly ''Marxism and Philosophy of Language'' and ''The Formal Method in Literary Scholarship''. These claims originated in the early 1970s and received their earliest full articulation in English in Clark and Holquist's 1984 biography of Bakhtin. In the years since then, however, most scholars have come to agree that Vološinov and Medvedev ought to be considered the true authors of these works. Although Bakhtin undoubtedly influenced these scholars and may even have had a hand in composing the works attributed to them, it now seems clear that if it was necessary to attribute authorship of these works to one person, Vološinov and Medvedev respectively should receive credit.&lt;ref&gt;Bota and Bronckart.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bakhtin had a difficult life and career, and few of his works were published in an authoritative form during his lifetime.&lt;ref name="Brandist The Bakhtin Circle, 1-26"&gt;Brandist ''The Bakhtin Circle'', 1-26&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there is substantial disagreement over matters that are normally taken for granted: in which discipline he worked (was he a philosopher or literary critic?), how to periodize his work, and even which texts he wrote (see below). He is known for a series of concepts that have been used and adapted in a number of disciplines: [[dialogic|dialogism]], the [[carnivalesque]], the chronotope, heteroglossia and "outsidedness" (the English translation of a Russian term ''vnenakhodimost,'' sometimes rendered into English—from French rather than from Russian—as "exotopy"). Together these concepts outline a distinctive philosophy of language and culture that has at its center the claims that all discourse is in essence a dialogical exchange and that this endows all language with a particular ethical or ethico-political force.

== Legacy ==

As a literary theorist, Bakhtin is associated with the [[Russian Formalists]], and his work is compared with that of [[Yuri Lotman]]; in 1963 [[Roman Jakobson]] mentioned him as one of the few intelligent critics of Formalism.&lt;ref name="Holquist Dialogism, p.183"&gt;Holquist ''Dialogism'', p.183&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, Bakhtin's work tended to focus on ethics and aesthetics in general. Early pieces such as ''Towards a Philosophy of the Act'' and ''Author and Hero in Aesthetic Activity'' are indebted to the philosophical trends of the time—particularly the Marburg School [[Neo-Kantianism]] of Hermann Cohen, including [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[Max Scheler]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Nicolai Hartmann]]. Bakhtin began to be discovered by scholars in 1963,&lt;ref name="Holquist Dialogism, p.183"/&gt; but it was only after his death in 1975 that authors such as [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Tzvetan Todorov]] brought Bakhtin to the attention of the Francophone world, and from there his popularity in the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other countries continued to grow. In the late 1980s, Bakhtin's work experienced a surge of popularity in the West.

Bakhtin's primary works include ''Toward a Philosophy of the Act,'' an unfinished portion of a philosophical essay; ''Problems of Dostoyevsky’s Art,'' to which Bakhtin later added a chapter on the concept of carnival and published with the title ''Problems of Dostoyevsky’s Poetics''; ''Rabelais and His World,'' which explores the openness of the Rabelaisian novel; ''The Dialogic Imagination,'' whereby the four essays that comprise the work introduce the concepts of dialogism, heteroglossia, and chronotope; and ''Speech Genres and Other Late Essays,'' a collection of essays in which Bakhtin concerns himself with method and culture.

In the 1920s there was a "Bakhtin school" in Russia, in line with the [[discourse]] analysis of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Roman Jakobson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Ludwig Berger]] ''Redeeming Laughter: The Comic Dimension of Human Experience'' (1997) p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence ===
He is known today for his interest in a wide variety of subjects, ideas, vocabularies, and periods, as well as his use of authorial disguises, and for his influence (alongside [[György Lukács]]) on the growth of Western scholarship on the novel as a premiere literary genre. As a result of the breadth of topics with which he dealt, Bakhtin has influenced such Western schools of theory as [[Neo-Marxism]], [[Structuralism]], [[Social constructionism]], and [[Semiotics]]. Bakhtin's works have also been useful in anthropology, especially theories of ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, David  and Eric K. Silverman (2005) "Dialogics of the Body: The Moral and the Grotesque in Two Sepik River Societies." ''Journal of Ritual Studies'' 19 (2) 17-52.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, his influence on such groups has, somewhat paradoxically, resulted in narrowing the scope of Bakhtin's work. According to Clark and Holquist, rarely do those who incorporate Bakhtin's ideas into theories of their own appreciate his work in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Bakhtin is traditionally seen as a literary critic, there can be no denying his impact on the realm of [[Rhetorical|rhetorical theory]]. Among his many theories and ideas Bakhtin indicates that style is a developmental process, occurring both within the user of language and language itself. His work instills in the reader an awareness of tone and expression that arises from the careful formation of verbal phrasing. By means of his writing, Bakhtin has enriched the experience of verbal and written expression which ultimately aids the formal teaching of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Some even suggest that Bakhtin introduces a new meaning to rhetoric because of his tendency to reject the separation of language and ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Klancher 24.&lt;/ref&gt; As Leslie Baxter explains, for Bakhtin, “Because all language use is riddled with multiple voices (to be understood more generally as discourses, ideologies, perspectives, or themes), meaning-making in general can be understood as the interplay of those voices.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Leslie|title=Communication as...: Perspectives on theory|year=2006|publisher=SAGE|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bakhtin and communication studies ===
Bakhtin's communication legacy reaches beyond rhetoric, social constructionism and semiotics as he has been called "the philosopher of human communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Danow|first=David|title=The Thought of Mikhail Bakhtin: From Word to Culture.|year=1991|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bakhtin “concentrates heavily on language and its general use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gary|first=Kim|title=Mikhail Bakhtin: The philosopher of human communication|journal=The University of Western Ontario Journal of Anthropology|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–62 [54]|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=totem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie Baxter observes: “Communication scholars have much to gain from conversing with Bakhtin’s dialogism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Leslie|title=Voicing relationships: A dialogic perspective|year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publishing, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim argues that “theories of human communication through verbal dialogue or literary representations” such as the ones Bakhtin studied “will apply to virtually every academic discipline in the human sciences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Gary|title=Mikhail Bakhtin: The philosopher of human communication" (54). |journal=The University of Western Ontario Journal of Anthropology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–62|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=totem}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bakhtin's theories on dialogism influence interpersonal communication research, and "dialogism represents a methodological turn towards the messy reality of communication, in all its many language forms.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=E.J.|title=Bakhtinian dialogism: A philosophical and methodological route to dialogue and difference?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/E_White/publication/242580201_Bakhtinian_dialogism_A_philosophical_and_methodological_route_to_dialogue_and_difference/links/559a66b808ae99aa62ccb40f/Bakhtinian-dialogism-A-philosophical-and-methodological-route-to-dialogue-and-difference.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to understand Bakhtin as a communication scholar one must take all forms of communication into account. While Bakhtin's works focused primarily on text, interpersonal communication is also key, especially when the two are related in terms of culture. Kim states that “culture as [[Clifford Geertz|Geertz]] and Bakhtin allude to can be generally transmitted through communication or reciprocal interaction such as a dialogue.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Gary|title=Mikhail Bakhtin: The philosopher of human communication.|journal=The University of Western Ontario Journal of Anthropology|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–62 [54]|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=totem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Interpersonal communication ====
“Any concrete [[utterance]] is a link in the chain of speech communication of a particular sphere. The very boundaries of the utterance are determined by a change of speech subjects. Utterances are not indifferent to one another, and are not self-sufficient; they are aware of and mutually reflect one another... Every utterance must be regarded as primarily a response to preceding utterances of the given sphere (we understand the word ‘response’ here in the broadest sense). Each utterance refutes affirms, supplements, and relies upon the others, presupposes them to be known, and somehow takes them into account... Therefore, each kind of utterance is filled with various kinds of responsive reactions to other utterances of the given sphere of speech communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakhtin|first=Mikhail|title=Speech genres and other late essays|year=1986|publisher=University of Austin|location=Texas|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is reminiscent of the inter-personal theory of communication [[turn-taking]]. This means that every utterance is related to another utterance, true to turn-taking in which the conversational norms are followed in order for a conversation to have a cohesive flow in which individuals respond to one another. If, for example, an utterance does not pertain to a previous utterance then a conversation is not occurring. However, the utterance will likely pertain to an utterance that the individual once heard- meaning it is, in fact, interrelated, just not in the context of that particular conversation. As Kim explains, “the entire world can be viewed as [[wikt:polyglossic|polyglossic]] or multi-voiced since every individual possesses their own unique world view which must be taken into consideration through dialogical interaction."&lt;ref name="autogenerated54"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Gary|title=Mikhail Bakhtin: The philosopher of human communication|journal=The University of Western Ontario Journal of Anthropology|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–62 [54]|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=totem}}&lt;/ref&gt; This world view must be considered when a conversation is occurring in order to better understand its cultural and communicative significance.

==== Communication and culture ====
“Bakhtin’s life work can be understood as a critique of the monologization of the human experience that he perceived in the dominant linguistic, literary, philosophical, and political theories of his time."&lt;ref name="baxter102"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Leslie|title=Communication as...:Perspectives on theory|year=2006|publisher=SAGE Publishing, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  True to his roots of social constructionism and post-modernism Bakhtin “was critical of efforts to reduce the unfinalizable, open, and multivocal process of meaning-making in determinate, closed, totalizing ways."&lt;ref name="baxter102"/&gt; According to Bakhtin, the meaning found in any dialogue is unique to the sender and recipient based upon their personal understanding of the world as influenced by the socio-cultural background. “Bakhtin’s dialogism opens up space for communication scholars to conceive of difference in new ways” meaning they must take the background of a subject into consideration when conducting research into their understanding of any text as “a dialogic perspective argues that difference (of all kinds) is basic to the human experience."&lt;ref name="baxter102"/&gt; Kim argues that “his ideas of art as a vehicle oriented towards interaction with its audience in order to express or communicate any sort of intention is reminiscent of [[Clifford Geertz]]’s theories on culture."&lt;ref name="autogenerated54"/&gt; Culture and communication become inextricably linked to one another as one's understanding, according to Bakhtin, of a given utterance, text, or message, is contingent upon their culture background and experience.

==== Carnivalesque and communication ====
Sheckels contends that "what [... Bakhtin] terms the ‘carnivalesque’ is tied to the body and the public exhibition of its more private functions [...] it served also as a communication event [...] anti-authority communication events [...] can also be deemed ‘carnivalesque’.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheckels|first=T.F.|title=Maryland politics and political communication: 1950-2005|year=2006|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, MD|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Essentially, the act of turning society around through communication, whether it be in the form of text, protest, or otherwise serves as a communicative form of carnival, according to Bakhtin. Steele furthers the idea of carnivalesque in communication as she argues that it is found in corporate communication. Steele states “that ritualized sales meetings, annual employee picnics, retirement roasts and similar corporate events fit the category of carnival.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodman|first=M.B.|title=Corporate communication: Theory and Practice|year=1994|publisher=SUNY|location=Albany|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnival cannot help but be linked to communication and culture as Steele points out that “in addition to qualities of inversion, ambivalence, and excess, carnival’s themes typically include a fascination with the body, particularly its little-glorified or 'lower strata' parts, and dichotomies between ‘high’ or ‘low’.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodman|first=M.B.|title=Corporate communication: Theory and Practice|year=1994|publisher=SUNY|location=Albany|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high and low binary is particularly relevant in communication as certain verbiage is considered high, while slang is considered low. Moreover, much of popular communication including television shows, books, and movies fall into high and low brow categories. This is particularly prevalent in Bakhtin's native Russia, where postmodernist writers such as [[Boris Akunin]] have worked to change low brow communication forms (such as the mystery novel) into higher literary works of art by making constant references to one of Bakhtin's favorite subjects, [[Dostoyevsky]].

[[File:Orthodox_pilgrim.jpg|thumb|An Eastern Orthodox woman in the [[Ukraine]] is seen wearing a dress and a [[Christian headcovering]].]]
The term '''modest fashion''' refers to a [[fashion]] trend of wearing less skin-revealing clothes. The exact interpretation of [[Modesty|'modest']] varies across cultures and countries.  There is no unambiguous interpretation as it is influenced by socio-cultural characteristics of each country. Beyond the various interpretations, all agree on the idea that modest fashion means loose clothing, comfortable dressing and covering of the body according to person's own comfort.

The term "modest" may have varied interpretations across religious boundaries and even within them. Commonalities can also exist; for example, many Christian, Jewish, and Muslim women practice the veiling of their head, with Christian women wearing a [[Christian headcovering|headcovering]], Jewish women wearing a [[tichel]], and Muslim women wearing a [[hijab]].&lt;ref name="Hunt2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Margaret|title=Women in Eighteenth Century Europe|date=11 June 2014|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|language=English|isbn=9781317883876|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“There’s a general misconception that modest clothing is inherently oppressive,” said Michelle Honig, an Orthodox Jewish fashion journalist and the keynote speaker during fashion month at [[New York University]] for the Meeting Through Modesty fashion symposium. “But if women in so-called ‘liberated countries’ still choose to cover their bodies, then they have made a choice. They have agency."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Modest fashion across religions expresses consensus that it should not be experienced as a limiting factor in style. Brands are churning out designs and collections that an orthodox Muslim, Jew, Christian, [[Hindu]] can wear in style. [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]], [[H&amp;M]], and [[Uniqlo]] are just a few names that have entered the modest fashion segment, making clothes that cover most parts of the body while allowing women to experiment with the latest trends.{{when|date=August 2018}}

The Albertoni Spinola Palace, with entrances in Campitelli square n. 2, Capizzuchi square and vicolo Capizzuchi is located in the 10th District (Rione Campitelli). It was projected and executed by [[Giacomo Della Porta]] and [[Girolamo Rainaldi]] around the end of 16th century and the first years of 17th century.

The building is protected by Italian Government and the distinctive feature of Palace consist in two buildings connected to each other but perfectly integrated that have generated the visual effect of the perspective on the Church of [[Santa Maria in Campitelli]].

== History ==
[[File:Facciata storica di Palazzo Albertoni Spinola.jpg|thumb|left|Palace Albertoni Facade (1620 ca.)]]
The work was commissioned by Marquis Baldassarre Paluzzi Albertoni initially to [[Giacomo della Porta]] (1532-1602), then continued and completed by [[Girolamo Rainaldi]] (1570-1655), in an area between the buildings De Rossi (later Cavalletti) and Capizucchi.
The work is the fruit of the work of the two great Renaissance architects who collaborated on several occasions and on various occasions through various papal commissions.

In 1603, Knight Baldassarre Paluzzi Albertoni requested a permit to build the new facade, widening the area of the existing property towards the square and aligning the new wall with the corner of the adjacent Capizucchi palace. In 1616, he required an additional permit to construct, over the back door of his palace and over the alley, an archway to allow passage to his "nearest neighbors" (this is the archway built in the back, in the outside of the building, at the height of the first floor).
So it is possible that the two buildings belonged to the same owner from the beginning, and then passed from one family to another. Moreover, it is plausible that the facade was created at another time – on an already existing renovated building – as witnessed by cartographers of the era: Cartaro, Du Peràc, and [[Antonio Tempesta|Tempesta]], whose maps indicate already existing houses in that area.
In addition, what also possibly indicates these two phases is the different alignment of the interior: it is orthogonal to the courtyard and to the sides of the adjacent palaces, but it is off-axis with respect to the front of the square. In fact, the entrance gallery of the building forms a diagonal connection between the square and the inner courtyard.

[[File:Chiesa di S. Maria in Campitelli by Giovan Battista Falda (1660s).jpg|thumb|right|Campitelli square (1660 ca)]]
The presence of the Albertoni family is recorded in [[Campitelli]] square: the family's coat-of-arms, the lion passant is to be found on the old fountain (1587–89) as well as in the palace, above the entrance, over the lintels and niches along the stairs and in the frieze below the cornice of the main facade where we see lions passant with roe deer.
Some of the minor palaces of the Paluzzi Albertoni family in Margana square, as well as under n. 36 of Via de' Delfini, were connected to the larger palace, both structurally and functionally. The heirs of the Paluzzi Albertoni family adopted on October 21, 1671 the surname and the arms of the Altieris together with the title of Princes by desire of [[Emilio Altieri]] (1590-1676) elevated to the Papacy in 1670 under the name of [[Clement X]]. Thus all the riches of the Altieris passed on to the descendants of the Paluzzi Albertoni family renamed as Altieri. In fact, the Palace of Piazza Campitelli turned out to be a less prestigious residence than the palace built by the Altieri al Gesù family which, together with the villa at the Lateran, was to host the works of art of the family.

The Palace in Piazza Campitelli, remaining at the hands of the renewed offspring of the Altieris for more than a century  was elevated with a fourth floor on top of the attic, and was sold in 1808 approximately by Prince Paluzzo Altieri to the Spanish politician [[Manuel Godoy]] y Alvares de Faria Ríos Sánchez Zarzosa, Prince of the Peace, {{ill|Prince of Bassano|es|Príncipe de Bassano}} (1767-1851). Somewhat later, the building was handed over to Cardinal [[Bartolomeo Pacca]] (1756-1844) who lived there from time to time at least from 1819. Upon Pacca's death, the palace of Piazza Campitelli belonged to his grandchildren for about fifty years, who rented parts of it out to their acquaintances, including Cardinals [[Giacomo Piccolomini]] and [[Giacomo Antonelli]].

Subsequently, in 1886 the building was sold by the descendants of Pacca to Countess Carolina Portalupi (1852-1891), who restored it, leaving it to her direct descendants, the Genoese Marquis Spinola [Maria Antonietta Spinola was later to marry the well-known politician [[Mario Cingolani]] (1883- 1971), while Bonifacio Spinola married his second cousin, Countess Marina Baldeschi (1895-1983)]. The restoration of the
Palace could not be postponed further since the complex was in a poor state of repair as a result of years of neglect: the works concerned mainly parts of the courtyard, the stairs, and the interiors. Walls were consolidated; arches, vaulted ceilings, and floors were reinforced or rebuilt; the eaves, roofs and terraces were repaired; the stairs and the floors of the landings of the main staircase were completely renewed;
and many ceilings were renovated – especially the decorated ones – as were the upholstery of the interior walls, with doors and windows. There are also some interventions documented in relation to a more proper distribution of water and the renovation of the bathrooms. This period also witnessed the construction of the new glass-covered gallery on the south-east, and probably the cant of the third floor towards Palazzo Cavalletti. The work was substantial, but left the structure of the building unchanged.

In 2006  and 2007 some conservative restoration work was carried out and the Palace is now in so good conditions that deserves this kind of masterpiece.

[[Giacomo Della Porta]] worked on the construction of the building by acting on the load-bearing structures and internal partitions from last years of 1500 until his death in 1602, after which [[Girolamo Rainaldi]], who from 1592 collaborated with the Maestro.,&lt;ref&gt;Cristiano Marchegiani, ''Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani'' , Enciclopedia Treccani, Volume, 86, 2016, Roma) "….

Even the hanging garden is aligned with the flyover doors both towards the first floor landing of the Palazzo Grande and towards the first floor of the Palazzetto. The façade and the external decorations of the Palazzo Grande are by Rainaldi with an exquisitely manneristic invention, while the immediate inheritance received by Della Porta provided for the general form of the compact and traditional construction&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Callari, ''I palazzi di Roma e le case d'importanza storica e artistica'', Roma, Ugo Sofia Moretti, 1944 (terza edizione., p. 437 s.v. «Palazzo Spinola»); Furio Fasolo, ''L'opera di Hieronimo e Carlo Rainaldi'', Roma, Ricerche,1961( pagine 59, 65 e 339, nota 5 « ... anche alla immediata eredità del Della Porta si devono la sua (di Girolamo Rainaldi) partecipazione ... al Palazzo Paluzzi»; « ... del resto Hieronimo ... quando completa il Palazzo Paluzzi disponendo il lavoro di travertini per il portale si attiene al suo 'modo' e non a quello del palazzo in cui operava: come ho già avuto modo di dire, mentre la forma generale è compatta e tradizionale, è nell'invenzione squisitamente manieristica del dettaglio che egli instancabilmente opera ... »; « ... l'intervento di Hieronimo in Palazzo Paluzzi è evidente nell'accentuato decorativismo minuzioso del portale; meno evidente nel cornicione»); Giorgio Torselli, ''Palazzi di Roma'', Milano, Ceschina,1965, (pagina 277 s.v. «Palazzo Spinola»); Vitaliano Tiberia, ''Giacomo della Porta'', Roma, Bulzoni, 1974, (pagina 44); Daniela Gallavotti Cavallero, ''I Palazzi di Roma dal XIV al XX secolo'', Roma, Quasar, 1989,(pagine 14-15, 249); Luigi Spezzaferro, Maria Elisa Tittoni, ''Il Campidoglio e Sisto V'', Roma, Carte Segrete, 1991, (pagine 80-81);&lt;/ref&gt; and generates the orthogonality of the internal entrance gallery. The subsequent construction of the overpass completes the integrative intentions derived from the astounding perspective of the Palazzetto, giving life over time, to an architectural [[masterpiece]] that could only emerge so perfect in the execution of the execution by the collaboration of two geniuses.

== Special visual effects ==

[[File:Prospettiva Palazzetto Albertoni Spinona.jpg|thumb|Palazzetto Albertoni Spinola - The perspective|thumb|right|The entrance gallery and the perspective(view from the Santa Maria in Campitelli Church Main door )]]
[[File:Giardino Palazzo Albertoni Spinola.jpg|thumb|left|The "secret" roof garden]]
The perspective vision that is obtained creates a sort of apparently inexplicable optical effect. In fact, moving backwards from the main entrance door of the Palace, the front entrance of the Church of [[Santa Maria in Campitelli]] begins to "move" from left to right until it coincides perfectly only when you reach the threshold of the door of the Palazzetto. It is necessary to underline that at the time of planning the facade of the current Church had not yet been built and that the birthplace of [[Blessed Ludovica Albertoni]],&lt;ref&gt;Marina Minozzi, ''Rivista Roma Sacra'', Elio De Rosa Editore, 1999, Roma; Parrocchia Santa Maria in Campitelli, ''I disegni di Carlo Rainaldi'', Archivio Parrocchiale Santa Maria in Campitelli, Roma, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; the true spiritual authority of the family, was located on the same site. The Paluzzi Albertoni had therefore probably wanted to keep the view from door to door to keep a constant memory of the Blessed. A part of the perimeter wall of the house of the Blessed is still visible with an ancient fresco inside the Chapel of the Albertoni family in Santa Maria in Campitelli.&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Ferraironi, ''Santa Maria in Campitelli'', Roma, Casa Editrice Roma, 1933; Maria Pedroli Bertoni, ''Santa Maria in Campitelli'', Istituto nazionale di Studi Romani, Roma, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effect produced is the loss of "orientation" within the two buildings: in fact, visiting the rooms from the inside, it is not fully realized if its position is in the large body of the Palace or in the other smaller, so called Palazzetto. A further visual peculiarity is that concerning the "secret" hanging garden, visible from the entrance of the flyover to the first floor of the Palazzo grande, although it is "hidden", as a rear offshoot of the first floor of the Palazzetto and therefore far from the square.

== Other sculptures in the Palace ==
[[File:Busto Palazzo Albertoni Spinola.jpg|thumb|left|Head of a priest of Isis reworked as "Publius Scipio Africanus"]]
In the Palace there is still a small collection of six portrayed heads – one in the entrance hall past the courtyard and the other five over the stairs – which were part of the collection of the Albertoni Paluzzi family, collectors of ancient artwork. The Paluzzi Albertoni collection was merged in the 1600s with the remarkable Altieri collection, enriching the family mansion and other properties including villas on the [[Esquilino]]
and at [[Porta Salaria]]. The busts to be found today in the Albertoni Spinola palace are "two ancient marble heads – one of a young woman and one of Antinous – mended in part; another ancient marble head – a priest of [[Isis]] – reworked in the [[Renaissance]] era as a portrait of [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus]]; two marble portraits reconstructed during the Renaissance era – one of [[Julius Caesar]] and another probably of [[Hesiod]] or Zeno of Elea – and a plaster cast of the head of Julius Caesar (probably of the Pacca and not of the Paluzzi family) taken from the statue preserved in the Senatorial Palace on the [[Capitoline Hill]]&lt;ref&gt;Giandomenico Spinola, ''Le sculture nel palazzo Albertoni Spinola a Roma e le collezioni Palazzi ed Altieri'', Rome, Giorgio Bretshneider, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Poo-Chi''' (or Poochi, Poochie), one of the first generations of robopet toys, is a [[robot dog]] designed by Samuel James Lloyd and Matt Lucas, manufactured by Sega Toys, and distributed by [[Tiger Toys]].&lt;ref name="elecpets" /&gt;  Poo-Chi was released in 2000 and discontinued in 2002.

== History ==
Sega Toys' Poo-Chi hit markets on 1 April 2000, with [[Hasbro]]'s [[Tiger Electronics]] distributing the toy in all countries other than [[Japan]] and [[Korea]]. Retailing at a price of 3,980 yen (then the equivalent of $38 USD) in Japan and $24.99 in the [[United States]], the toy offered significantly cheaper competition to the [[Sony AIBO|AIBO]]'s prices of up to 250,000 yen (then $2,400 USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Puppy love | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=19 January 2000 | agency=[[Associated Press]] | author=Inouye, Itsuo | pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/679642.stm | title=Robofish splash down in Tokyo | work=[[BBC News]] | date=16 March 2000 | accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leadsalespr"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.mimitchi.com/html/furbn147.htm | title=Poo-Chi Leads the Pack in Holiday Toy Sales | publisher=Business Wire | date=12 December 2000 | accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Hasbro's sales in their leading [[Furby]] line were slowing since its initial release in 1998 and sales of [[Star Wars]] branded merchandise was in decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Slow sales cause Hasbro second-quarter earnings to fall 80 percent | work=Associated Press | date=20 July 2000 | location=Pawtucket, RI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Poo-Chi's release was a success, selling over 10 million units worldwide over the span of 8 months since its initial debut.&lt;ref name="leadsalespr" /&gt;

Special editions of the Poo-Chi soon sprouted, such as the ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'' holiday release of three Poo-Chis resembling the characters Domino, Little Dipper, and Oddball.&lt;ref name="leadsalespr" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cdn.media.ir.thewaltdisneycompany.com/2000/annual/ar_2000.pdf | title=The Walt Disney Company Annual Report 2000 | publisher=[[Walt Disney Company]] | accessdate=15 November 2013 | pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to special editions, an upgraded version, the Super Poo-Chi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Sony hopes for success with new robotic pet | work=Bangor Daily News | date=13 October 2000 | agency=Associated Press | author=Kageyama, Yuri | pages=A9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and differing [[Dog breed|breed]]s of the Poo-Chi were released (all of which could communicate together), along with spin-offs such as the Meow-Chi and the Chirpy-Chi.&lt;ref name="leadsalespr" /&gt; Miniature versions were featured as toys in the [[McDonald's]] [[Happy Meal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.promoduck.com/PressRelease/html/press_con01a038.htm | title=Tiger Robo-Chi Pets™ Arrive at McDonald's February 23 Happy Meal Event to Feature Newest Cyber-Pal, Chirpy-Chi | date=20 February 2001 | accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poo-Chi stopped selling in 2002, having been replaced by [[FurReal Friends]].

==Description==
The original Poo-Chi had a gray body with ears, tail, and leg joints of either purple, blue, pink or green colour. With four legs allowing the toy to stand up or lie down, it utilized a red [[LED]] display as eyes to show [[emotion]].&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.robotsandcomputers.com/robots/manuals/Poo-Chi.pdf | title=Poo-Chi Instruction Manual | publisher=Tiger Electronics | accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oldrobots"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theoldrobots.com/smallbot34.html | title=Pio-Chi Robot Dog by Tiger Electronics Ltd - The Old Robots Web Site | publisher=The Old Robots Web Site | accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Editions===
The Christmas Special Edition Poo-Chi was offered for a limited time, coloured red and white with snowflake designs throughout the body, ears, with an interactive bone included in its seasonal box. The toy had its list of songs updated to include Christmas music. The Christmas Special Edition was only available in a handful of countries and retailed for 2–3 months, making it the rarest and most collectible of the genre with collectors realizing in excess of $300 USD for boxed Christmas Poo-Chi units.

===Speech===
Poo-Chi spoke using prerecorded sounds such as barks, whines, and growls. Due to limitations of the toy's technology, most of the sounds were rendered as beeps rather than a realistic sound effect. Poo-Chi could also "bark" songs, which could be prompted by pressing the button on the top of its head.

===Spin-offs===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
Multiple spin-offs of the Poo-Chi were produced. All were based on different animals, other than the Super Poo-Chi, a larger version of the original toy.

* Meow-Chi - a robotic [[cat]].
* Super Poo-Chi - a larger version of the original toy.
* Dino-Chi - a robotic [[dinosaur]], with two types produced: the Dino-Chi [[Tyrannosaurus|T. Rex]] and the Dino-Chi [[Pterodactylus|Pterodactyl]].
* Chirpy-Chi - a robotic [[bird]].
* Petal-Chi - a robotic [[flower]] or [[plant]].
* Baby-chi - a robotic [[baby]].
* Botster - a regular robot.

===Songs===
The Poo-Chi could "sing" one of 6 songs when following the light sensor in its nose being activated, the touch sensor on its head was pressed. The toy would then emit a series of high-pitched beeps. The user could afterwards press the touch sensor, the number of times the sensor having been pressed corresponding to a different tune. The different songs the Poo-Chi could play are as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Number of sensor presses
! Song title
|-
| 1
| [[Wedding March (Mendelssohn)|The Wedding March]]
|-
| 2
| Camptown Races
|-
| 3
| Bingo
|-
| 4
| I've Been Working on the Railroad/Home On the Range
|-
| 5
| Beethoven No.9                              
|-
| 6
| When the Saints Come Marching In
|}

Poo-Chi would often sing "[[Ode to Joy]]" by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] when happy, and if another Poo-Chi or Robo-Chi pet was nearby (such as a Meow-Chi), that other Robo-Chi would begin to sing "Ode to Joy" as well, though the playback would not be synchronized.

''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' ({{lang-de|Der Einzige und sein Eigentum}}) is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] work by [[German language|German]] philosopher [[Max Stirner]] (1806-1856), first published in 1844.

==English editions==
[[File:Den ende.png|thumb|right|''Den ende och hans egendom'' – a 1911 Swedish edition, with a foreword by [[Georg Brandes]] and afterword by [[Albert Jensen (anarchist)|Albert Jensen]].]]
===First edition (1907)===
* The first English Language Edition appeared in 1907; it was a translation by the [[United States|American]] [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]], [[Steven T. Byington]] with an introduction by [[James L. Walker]]. The publisher was [[Benjamin R. Tucker]], [[New York City]]. This edition was reprinted several times by several publishers in New York and [[London]] up to 1931.

===Libertarian Book Club edition (1963)===
* The 1963 [[Libertarian Book Club]] edition is a re-print of the 1907 Byington translation. Edited by [[James J. Martin]] and with a cover by the son of [[Rudolf Rocker]], the edition revived interest in Stirner as an influence on [[anarchism]] and related ideologies and brought [[Max Stirner]] to a wider audience in the [[English-speaking world]]. This edition was reprinted several times by several publishers in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] up to 1993, sometimes with a preface by Sidney E. Parker.

===Harper &amp; Row - Readings in Fascist, Racist and Elitist Ideology (1971)===
* An [[abridged]] English edition of the Byington translation revised, selected and annotated by John Carroll. [[New York City]] / [[London]]: [[Harper &amp; Row]] 1971. 266 pp. The book appeared in a series "Roots of the Right. Readings in [[Fascist]], [[Racist]] and [[Elitist]] [[Ideology]]", together with writings by [[Gobineau]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], [[Joseph de Maistre|de Maistre]], [[Maurras]]. The text consists of a mix of about a hundred quotations from ''The Ego'' (and some from Stirner's minor writings), reducing the volume by about a half. The reason why Stirner's work was selected for this series remains unclear given the book's fierce anti-authoritarianism and emphasis on the sovereignty of the individual.

===Rebel Press edition (1993)===
* The 1993 Rebel Press, [[London]] edition is an unabridged republication of the 1963 re-print of the 1907 Byington translation by the Libertarian Book Club. The Rebel Press, [[London]] edition has a cover design from [[anarchist]] [[artist]] and [[cartoonist]], [[Clifford Harper]] and a preface by Sidney E. Parker.

===Cambridge University press edition (1995)===
* The [[Cambridge University]] press edition (ed. David Leopold, 1995) is a revised version of the original 1907 Byington translation with a new introduction by David Leopold. Leopold changed the title (His to Its) "not out of ahistorical considerations of 'political correctness' but because [[Stirner]] clearly identifies the egoistic subject as prior to gender" (p. xl). While Leopold accepted the Byington translation as "an heroic attempt to convey the readable yet idiosyncratic prose of [[Stirner]]'s original", he "made a number of amendments, such as removing infelicities and archaisms, replacing the occasional missing sentence, and restoring some of the original paragraph and sections breaks." (p. xxxix)

===Underworld Amusements edition (2017)===
* [[Individualist Anarchism|Individual Anarchist]] writer and historian Wolfi Landstreicher began his completely new translation in 2010, and published under the more literal title of "The Unique and Its Property." All prior published editions had been reproductions of, or based on the Byington translation, but Landstreicher's work constitutes the second full translation ever completed. He also wrote an introduction to it.

'''''Right and Left''''' is a 1909 oil on canvas painting by the American artist [[Winslow Homer]]. It depicts a pair of [[common goldeneye]] ducks at the moment they are hit by a hunter's shotgun blast as they attempt to take flight. Completed less than two years before his death, it was Homer's last great painting,&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;Cikovsky, 374&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the subject of a variety of interpretations regarding its origin, composition and meaning. As with his other late masterworks, it represents a return to the sporting and hunting subjects of Homer's earlier years, and was to be his final engagement with the theme. Its design recalls that of [[Japanese art]], and the composition resembles that of a colored engraving by [[John James Audubon]].

==Background==
In May 1908 Homer suffered temporary impairment of his speech and muscular control as the effects of a mild stroke; on June 4 he wrote his brother Charles that "I can paint as well as ever. I think my pictures better for having one eye in the pot and one eye up a chimney— a new departure in the art world."&lt;ref&gt;Cikovsky, 405&lt;/ref&gt; By July 18 he was able to write that he had regained his abilities with the exception of tying "my neck tie in the way that I have done for the past 20 years....Every four or five days I try to do it but....it has been of no use."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 238-239&lt;/ref&gt; Although he never completely recovered, Homer was well enough to attempt a major work, and it is probably ''Right and Left'' that he referred to in a letter to his brother Charles dated December 8, 1908: "I am painting when it is light enough on a most surprising picture".&lt;ref name="C5"&gt;Cikovsky, 375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cikovsky, 406&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:A Good Shot by Winslow Homer, 1892.png|thumb|left|Winslow Homer. ''A Good Shot, Adirondacks'', 1892. Watercolor. National Gallery of Art. With the hunter a distant element and the stricken animal placed in the foreground, this watercolor anticipates the composition of ''Right and Left''.&lt;ref name="CO"&gt;Cooper, 184&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Homer's biographers offer varying accounts of the events surrounding both the painting's conception and initial development. Homer's first biographer, William Howe Downes, wrote that the ducks used for the painting had been purchased by the artist for his Thanksgiving dinner; he so admired their [[plumage]] that he painted them instead.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 388&lt;/ref&gt; Homer's nephew told another of Homer's biographers, Philip Beam, that a friend of the artist named Phineas W. Sprague shot the birds in [[Prouts Neck]] that autumn and hung them on Homer's studio door, and the arrangement inspired the painting's design.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 388&lt;/ref&gt; Given the goldeneye's taste— Audubon called the duck "fishy, and in my opinion unfit for being eaten"— insofar as the implication is that the ducks were intended for food, neither story is altogether credible.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 388&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Likewise there are different versions regarding Homer's preparatory methods. Downes recounted that Homer took to sea in a boat, accompanied by a man with a [[double-barreled shotgun]], and studied the movements of birds as they were shot.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 388&lt;/ref&gt; In Beam's telling, Homer stood atop a cliff at [[Prouts Neck, Maine|Prouts Neck]] while his neighbor [[William Googins|Will Googins]], fired blank charges in his direction from a rowboat offshore.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 388&lt;/ref&gt; However, Homer was already familiar with this angle of shotgun blast, having in 1864 painted ''Defiance'', a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] subject of a soldier being shot at, and in 1892 ''A Good Shot, Adirondacks'', which shows the puff of distant rifle smoke and a mortally wounded deer hit in the foreground;&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 388&lt;/ref&gt; the latter especially anticipates the composition and intent of ''Right and Left''.&lt;ref name="CO"&gt;Cooper, 184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
For its "restrained color and extraordinary composition" the painting's debt to Japanese art has been noted by art historians.&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;Cikovsky, 374&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, 206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Cikovsky, 389&lt;/ref&gt; It has been compared to avian subjects by [[Okyo Maruyama]], [[Hiroshige]], and [[Hokusai]], and was included in a major ''[[Japonisme]]'' exhibition in Paris in 1988.&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Cikovsky, 389&lt;/ref&gt; As well, it resembles John James Audubon's plate ''Golden-Eye Duck''.&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;Cikovsky, 374&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:342 Golden-Eye Duck.jpg|thumb|[[John James Audubon]], ''Golden-Eye Duck'']]

Against the tradition of birds painted as dead [[still life]] objects, ''Right and Left'' is unique for its depiction of the very moment of death.&lt;ref name="L"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/great-works/homer-winslow-right-and-left-1907-744413.html Lubbock]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their rapid movement, the birds are seen as if frozen in a snapshot, and the viewer is literally afforded a bird's eye view, in the line of the hunter's fire.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt; Though the painting represents violent action, its formal aesthetic is that of sharply focused detachment,&lt;ref name="L"/&gt; and has been described by Nicolai Cikovsky, Jr. of the [[National Gallery of Art]] as "a staggeringly beautiful and almost oriental arrangement of birds--just abstract shapes against bands of the subtlest cream and grey".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/collection/rightandleft.shtm National Gallery of Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105050836/http://www.nga.gov/collection/rightandleft.shtm |date=2010-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design consists of four horizontal bands of sea and sky which are connected by a series of vertical and diagonal shapes formed by the ducks' bodies— the one at left (male) struggling to ascend, its partner in a similar position but turned 90 degrees, already falling limp— and wave crests.&lt;ref name="COO"&gt;Cooke, 118&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the birds' webbed feet and beaks and the boat's bow repeat the jagged contours of the waves.&lt;ref name="COO"&gt;Cooke, 118&lt;/ref&gt; Half hidden, the hunters occupy an ambiguous position, and it is uncertain whether the line above them denotes the horizon or a fog bank.&lt;ref name="COO"&gt;Cooke, 118&lt;/ref&gt; Atop this line is the rim of the sun, depicted as a red sliver.&lt;ref name="COO"&gt;Cooke, 118&lt;/ref&gt; At the right is a stray feather which "serves as an exclamation point for the whole composition."&lt;ref name="COO"&gt;Cooke, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was received by [[Knoedler|Knoedler &amp; Co.]] gallery in New York by January 30, 1909, and was described by the gallery as ''The Golden Eye or Whistler Duck''.&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Cikovsky, 389&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Downes the painting was initially exhibited without Homer's having titled it, and received its name from a hunter who shouted appreciatively "Right and left!", the term for a rifleman's accomplishment in taking down two birds in quick succession with a double-barreled shotgun.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 388&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=39763&amp;detail=none National Gallery of Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110062726/http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=39763&amp;detail=none |date=2010-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon viewing the painting in New York, its first owner, Randal Morgan, asked several questions regarding Homer's intent: he inquired as to the direction of the largest wave, and the cause of the disturbance in the water at the front of the picture, which he believed was the impetus for the ducks' movement to leave their feeding.&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Cikovsky, 389&lt;/ref&gt; The questions were forwarded to the artist, but his reply is unknown. On August 3, 1909 Morgan bought the painting for $5,000, $4,000 of which went to Homer.&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Cikovsky, 389&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
Although it is a painting of a sporting subject, and thus was part of a popular anecdotal tradition, given both the violence of the subject and the fact that it was painted the year before Homer's death, ''Right and Left'' has invited metaphysical interpretation.&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Cikovsky, 389&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cikovsky, 374-375&lt;/ref&gt; For art historian [[John Wilmerding]], the painting embodied "a sense of the momentary and the universal, mortality illuminated by showing these creatures at the juncture of life and death".&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Cikovsky, 389&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the summation of Homer's sporting pictures, and presents its subject with an "almost testamentary finality".&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;Cikovsky, 374&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has also been suggested that in addition to summarizing interests that were lifelong for Homer, as well as referring to the works of previous artists, a modern and ironic meaning may have been intended as well: in 1908 air travel was a novel and transforming human achievement, one fraught with the adventure and danger of flight.&lt;ref name="C5"&gt;Cikovsky, 375&lt;/ref&gt; Considering his worldly and pictorial intelligence, it is possible that Homer intended ''Right and Left'' as an oblique reference to this aspect of modern life.&lt;ref name="C5"&gt;Cikovsky, 375&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Drawing School''' is an educational organisation and [[Charitable organization#Charity registration|registered charity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1101538}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[London Borough of Hackney]] in [[England]]. It was founded in 2000 by the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] as '''The Prince's Drawing School''' and received its current name in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knox|first1=James|title=Royal Drawing School receives official title from The Queen|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Royal-Drawing-School-receives-official-title-from-The-Queen/36287|accessdate=19 November 2014|work=[[The Art Newspaper]]|date=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the Royal Drawing School is to raise the standard and profile of drawing through teaching and practice. It is one of only a few institutions in the world offering in-depth, quality tuition for those who wish to develop their observational drawing skills.

As well as a Postgraduate Programme, the School runs a broad range of affordable courses designed for both professional artists and other interested adults, including master classes in the life room, in museums and galleries and in the streets and parks of [[London]]. Drawing instruction is delivered by distinguished artists and teachers from leading institutions including the [[Royal Academy Schools]], [[Central Saint Martins]], the [[Royal College of Art]] and the [[Slade School of Fine Art|Slade]]. Over 3,000 students have attended classes since 2000; there are over 130 alumni of the Postgraduate Programme.{{Update inline|date=August 2018}} The School, founded by the Prince of Wales, is based on the top floor of a converted warehouse in [[Shoreditch]], an area rich in galleries and design studios.

The School also aims to make it possible for every child with an aptitude for drawing to achieve their potential. The School provides serious, sustained tuition and mentoring, for children aged 10–14, from all backgrounds, through affordable programmes which are provided when and where it works for students.

'''''Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy''''' (or ''The Ecstasy of Saint Francis'') is a painting by the Italian Baroque master [[Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio]]. It is held in the [[Wadsworth Atheneum|Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060515062933/http://www.wadsworthatheneum.org/view/european-paint-sculpture.php?art_work_index=9 Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy - Notes at Wadsworth Atheneum website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was the first of Caravaggio's religious canvasses, and is thought to date from 1595, when he had recently entered the household of [[Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte]]. It was presumably painted at the behest of Del Monte, and is thought to be one of the first paintings done by the artist as "Del Monte's painter", as he is believed to have described himself over the next few years while living in [[Palazzo Madama]]. It shows [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] (the Cardinal's name-saint) at the moment of receiving the signs of the [[Stigmata]], the wounds left in Christ's body by the Crucifixion. The story is told by one of Francis' companions, [[Brother Leo]]. In 1224 Francis retired to the wilderness with a small number of his followers  to contemplate God. On the mountainside at night Brother Leo saw a six-winged [[seraph]] (one of the higher Orders of angels) come down to Francis in answer to the saint's prayer that he might know both Christ's suffering and His love:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;All of a sudden there was a dazzling light. It was as though the heavens were exploding and splashing forth all their glory in millions of waterfalls of colours and stars. And in the centre of that bright whirlpool was a core of blinding light that flashed down from the depths of the sky with terrifying speed until suddenly it stopped, motionless and sacred, above a pointed rock in front of Francis. It was a fiery figure with wings, nailed to a cross of fire. Two flaming wings rose straight upward, two others opened out horizontally, and two more covered the figure. And the wounds in the hands and feet and heart were blazing rays of blood. The sparkling features of the Being wore an expression of supernatural beauty and grief. It was the face of Jesus, and Jesus spoke. Then suddenly streams of fire and blood shot from His wounds and pierced the hands and feet of Francis with nails and his heart with the stab of a lance. As Francis uttered a mighty shout of joy and pain, the fiery image impressed itself into his body, as into a mirrored reflection of itself, with all its love, its beauty, and its grief. And it vanished within him. Another cry pierced the air. Then, with nails and wounds through his body, and with his soul and spirit aflame, Francis sank down, unconscious, in his blood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franciscanfriarstor.com/stfrancis/stf_stigmata_of_st_francis_articles.htm St. Francis Receives the Stigmata - Brother Leo's account] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20061020184834/http://www.franciscanfriarstor.com/stfrancis/stf_stigmata_of_st_francis_articles.htm |date=2006-10-20 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio - St. Francis in Ecstasy (detail) - WGA04080.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy'' (detail).]]Caravaggio's painting is less dramatic than the account given by Leo - the six-winged seraph is replaced by a two-winged [[angel]], and there is none of the violent confrontation described by Leo - no streams of fire, no pools of blood, no shouts or fiery images of Christ. Just the gentle-seeming angel, bulking far larger than the unconscious saint, and Francis' companions in the middle distance, almost invisible in the darkness.

The subject had been a popular one ever since the 13th century: [[Giotto]] treated it about 1290, and [[Giovanni Bellini]] painted a famous version about 1480-85. Caravaggio's version is much more intimate and marks a sharp change of key: the saint, who has the features of Del Monte, seems to sink back peacefully into the arms of a boy (who bears a marked resemblance to the boy in ''[[Boy Peeling a Fruit]]'' and to the winged Cupid on the far left of ''[[The Musicians (Caravaggio)|The Musicians]]'', and even more to the boy being cheated in ''[[Cardsharps]]'') wearing a sheet and some stage-prop wings. There is very little to indicate the subject beyond the saint's Franciscan robe - no sign of the Stigmata, or blood, except the wound in his heart, nor of the fearsome seraph. Yet the atmosphere remains genuinely spiritual, the two figures lit by an unearthly effulgence in the dark night-time landscape where strange glimmerings flicker on the horizon. The scene is at once real and unreal. Del Monte kept it till the end of his life, and several copies went into circulation and were greatly valued.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4681">A '''technical advisor''' is an individual who is an expert in a particular field of [[wiktionary:knowledge|knowledge]], hired to provide detailed information and advice to people working in that field.  For example, a construction company might hire a technical expert in fluid dynamics to advise them if seeking to move a small water course or a company operating in [[adventure education]] will frequently hire technical experts to ensure that their policies and procedures are robust enough to handle the hazards they are going to face.

==Film and television==
[[Movie director|Movie]] or [[television director]]s, will often hire a technical advisor to ensure that a complicated area is portrayed accurately in the production. For example, a director for a show involving [[combat]] [[aviation]] might hire one or more current or former combat [[Aviator|pilots]] to serve as technical advisors. Similarly, a [[historical period|period]] movie may include one or more [[historian]]s of the period, or eyewitnesses if possible, for the same purpose.

Technical advisors typically answer to the director. Their expertise adds realism both to the [[acting]] and to the [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] of a movie. Some advisors for military movies have been known to run miniature [[recruit training|boot camp]]s to give [[actor]]s a first-hand experience of a [[wiktionary:military|military]] setting. Captain [[Dale Dye]] is a noted technical advisor and provider of military training for actors through his [[Warriors, Inc.]]. The [[US Army]] has often provided technical advisors to [[war film]]s. [[Nipo T. Strongheart]] was a noted technical advisor on several movies dealing with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].&lt;ref name=Hearne2013&gt;{{cite book|author=Joanna Hearne|title=Native Recognition: Indigenous Cinema and the Western|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJ9z36n4ps8C&amp;pg=PA78|date=25 January 2013|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-4399-7|pages=78, 107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strongheart1954"&gt;{{cite journal

The [[British Army]] have supplied their own brand of technical military advisors to the film industry. [http://www.kftv.com/news/2016/08/24/screen-action-filming-with-the-military Paul Biddiss] is one such expert, who has built on a long military career to advise on a multitude of high-profile films and TV series. 

Technical advisors who have become actors include [[George Kennedy]] (an Army advisor to the ''[[The Phil Silvers Show|Sgt. Bilko]]'' [[television show]]) and [[John Dierkes]] (an accountant working for the [[U.S. Treasury]], who provided technical assistance to the makers of ''[[To the Ends of the Earth]]''). A former [[child actor]], [[Frank Coghlan Jr]], enlisted in the [[U.S. Navy]], and later became an advisor to Hollywood on Navy-themed films.&lt;ref&gt;Coghlan, Frank ''They Still Call Me Junior'' McFarland &amp; Co 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

[[R. Lee Ermey]], a former U.S. Marine who became a technical advisor on several [[Vietnam War]] films lensed in the [[Philippines]] became a lead actor in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' as well as an advisor. Ermey said "A technical advisor must be a salesman. He's got to be able to sell the producer-director on his way of doing things"&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, Larry ''The Few and the Proud: Marine Corps Drill Instructors in Their Own Words'' 2006 W.W. Norton &amp; Co&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|158}} Ermey told of battles with Kubrick over realism, and what could be shown onscreen and be appreciated by a cinema audience. Ermey lost battles over such items as a recruit having concealed a fully loaded magazine in his footlocker rather than a few stray rounds, and the way Marine Corps Drill Instructors hit recruits in the solar plexus rather than slapping their faces. Ermey won over Kubrick in other points of Marine Corps decorum.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;{{rp|159}}

The ''' Crucifucks''' were a [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]], [[Michigan]]-based [[punk band]] formed in 1981.&lt;ref name="viceland.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=McPheeters |first=Sam |url=http://www.viceland.com/int/v16n1/htdocs/the-troublemakers-515.php?country= |title=The Troublemaker &amp;#124; VICE |publisher=Viceland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were noted for their political agitation, provocative lyrics, and unusually shrill vocals by band leader [[Doc Corbin Dart]]. [[Dead Kennedys]] vocalist [[Jello Biafra]] signed them to his independent [[Alternative Tentacles]] label.

Other members of the original line up included Dart's cousin Joe on guitar, Scott Fagersten on bass, and drummer [[Steve Shelley]], who went on to play with [[Sonic Youth]].

==History==
The band's debut [[Vinyl record|LP]] ''[[The Crucifucks (album)|The Crucifucks]]''—recorded in 1984 and released in 1985 on [[Jello Biafra]]'s [[Alternative Tentacles]] [[record label|label]]. ''[[Wisconsin (album)|Wisconsin]]'' followed in 1987, also on Alternative Tentacles. Between that album and 1996's ''L.D. Eye'', Dart recorded two solo projects, ''Patricia'', on Alternative Tentacles in 1990, and ''Black Tuesday'', a self-released cassette, in 1991.  After a long hiatus, Doc released an album entitled "The Messiah" on Crustacean Records in 2004. The moniker he used for this album is "26".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.punknews.org/article/11164/the-crucifucks-doc-dart-returns-with-new-record The Crucifucks' Doc Dart returns with new record&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A Crucifucks [[compilation album]] entitled ''[[Our Will Be Done]]'' was issued in 1992, combining the band's first two LPs with a non-LP song, "Annual Report," also featured on [[Maximum Rock 'n' Roll]]'s compilation ''Welcome To 1984''. A picture of a Philadelphia police officer posing as shot—originally part of a public relations campaign &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroc.org/updates/crucifu2.htm Big Victory For Alternative Tentacles Records&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain wage concessions from the city  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroc.org/updates/crucifux.htm PHILADELPHIA POLICE GET $2.2 MILLION JUDGEMENT AGAINST ALTERNATIVE TENTACLES RECORDS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;—was used on the album's back cover. Four years later, its discovery by the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police led to a lawsuit against the Crucifucks, which was eventually dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrl.nott.ac.uk/~dxl/reviews/NARS/Vol3/tentacles.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926230939/http://www.mrl.nott.ac.uk/~dxl/reviews/NARS/Vol3/tentacles.html |date=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dart: the Crucifucks never "officially" broke up, but rather drifted apart due to a variety of reasons.  By the mid 1990s, Dart had formed a new group called The L.D. Eye.  When the group had prepared a full-length record, Alternative Tentacles agreed to release it under the stipulation that it be credited to The Crucifucks.  Thus, the group changed its name to The Crucifucks, "reuniting" the band (although no former members other than Dart were involved with The L.D. Eye) and used their former moniker as the record title.  ''The L.D. Eye'' was released in 1996. The band played a number of concerts during this period, including a 1998 performance at Alternative Tentacles' twentieth anniversary party at the [[Great American Music Hall]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], before sinking back into inactivity.

The band was known for its anti-authoritarian lyrics, often rife with obscure and perverse humor. The band sought to go beyond the pale in terms of lyrical content, attempting to be as offensive as possible. Many of their other songs are similarly blunt, attacking the American government, American culture in general, and religion, particularly Christianity.

As recently as 2006, Dart has begun identifying himself by the name ''26'' (dropping his entire given name of Doc Corbin Dart) and renounces swear words, such as his former group's moniker.&lt;ref name="viceland.com"/&gt;

'''''The Spear''''' is a painting by [[Cape Town]]-based South African artist, [[Brett Murray]].  It depicts South African President [[Jacob Zuma]] in a pose reminiscent of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], with his genitals exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Govender|first=Peroshni|title=Presidential penis portrait riles S. Africa's ANC|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE84H07820120518|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting triggered a defamation lawsuit by Zuma's party, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), and was vandalised on 22 May 2012.

== Exhibition ==
Prior to its being vandalised, ''The Spear'' was shown at the Goodman Gallery in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa.  The painting featured as one of the pieces of artist Brett Murray's ''Hail to the Thief II'' exhibition, which commenced on 10 May 2012.&lt;ref name=Goodman/&gt; Inspiration is understood to have been drawn from the [[Viktor Semyonovich Ivanov]]'s poster ''Lenin Lived, Lenin is Alive, Lenin Will Live''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The painting of President Zuma|url=http://inside-politics.org/2012/05/17/the-painting-of-president-zuma/|work=www.inside-politics.org|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition features various pieces that are critical of South Africa's ruling party, the ANC, showcasing sculptures and images that suggest [[corruption]] and bad governance.&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;{{cite web|title=Goodman Gallery - Hail to the Thief II|url=http://www.goodman-gallery.com/exhibitions/265|publisher=Goodman Gallery|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray's works in the exhibition also include modifying ANC liberation struggle posters and flyers from the [[Apartheid]] era, some displaying the text "Amandla, we demand Chivas, BMWs and bribes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/saturday-star/it-s-staying-up-1.1302261 |title=It’s staying up! |author=Sameer Naik and Kashiefa Ajam |date=22 May 2012 |work=The Saturday Star |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public perception of Jacob Zuma ==
Zuma has often been the centre of scandal and ridicule, due to his polygamous lifestyle with many wives and girlfriends,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacob Zuma - "Polygamy is part of my culture"|url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/jacob-zuma-polygamy-part-my-culture|publisher=Radio Netherlands Worldwide|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a comment he made during his 2006 [[Jacob Zuma rape trial|rape trial]] that showering after sex would minimise the risk of contracting [[HIV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SA's Zuma 'showered to avoid HIV'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4879822.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His lifestyle has made him the target of well-known cartoonist [[Zapiro]], who frequently depicts Zuma with a shower on his head, ridiculing the statements he made during his trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicolaides|first=Gia|title=Zapiro revives showerhead|url=http://news.iafrica.com/sa/574737.html|publisher=iafrica.com|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zapiro was also sued for defamation by the ANC, with a hearing expected in October 2012.&lt;ref name=BBC185 /&gt; These public perceptions of Zuma provided part of the basis for Brett Murray's painting.&lt;ref name=BBC185&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18115724 |title=Jacob Zuma painting: ANC to sue South Africa's Brett Murray |date=18 May 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapiro added fuel to the fire by doing his own version of the painting, replacing the genitals with a showerhead.&lt;ref name=Zapiro185&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zapiro.com/cartoon/890737-120520st |title=Published in Sunday Times on 20 May 2012 |date=20 May 2012 |publisher=Zapiro |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another appeared two days later, ridiculing Zuma.&lt;ref name=Zapiro186&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zapiro.com/cartoon/892612-120522tt |title=120522tt - President Zuma outraged at Brett Murray's Painting - Spear of the Nation |date=22 May 2012 |publisher=Zapiro |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ANC response ==

Owner and director of the Goodman Gallery, Liza Essers, said that she received a telephone call on Sunday, 13 May 2012 from special advisor to the minister of arts and culture Mduduzi Mbata seeking to clarify her thoughts on the exhibition, after it had been reviewed in the newspaper [[City Press (South Africa)|''City Press'']], along with a photograph of ''The Spear''. During the brief conversation she invited him to visit the gallery the following Tuesday, but he never kept the appointment.&lt;ref name=AiA&gt;{{cite web|last=Dubin|first=Steven|title=Liza Essers, Gallery Owner, on the Show that Scandalized South Africa|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-opinion/conversations/2012-06-05/liza-essers-brent-murray-goodman-gallery/|work=Art in America|publisher=Art in America|accessdate=7 June 2012|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ANC issued a press release on 17 May 2012 expressing outrage about the painting and their intention to apply to the High Court to have it removed, this being reiterated by attorneys representing the ANC and Jacob Zuma in an email sent to Essers the same day.&lt;ref name=AiA/&gt; The painting drew strong condemnation from ANC rulers and various religious groups, who found the painting 'obscene' and 'vulgar'.&lt;ref name="mosomane1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosomane|first=Phuti|title=Zuma painting against Ubuntu, African morality, culture|url=http://www.thenewage.co.za/Detail.aspx?news_id=51152&amp;cat_id=1007|publisher=The New Age|accessdate=19 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526184457/http://www.thenewage.co.za/Detail.aspx?news_id=51152&amp;cat_id=1007|archivedate=26 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leader of the Nazareth Baptist Church called for the artist to be stoned to death.&lt;ref name=AiA/&gt; The ANC also demanded that the image be taken down from the [[City Press (South Africa)|''City Press'']]' website.  ANC spokesperson Jackson Mthembu said of the painting, "The African National Congress is extremely disturbed and outraged by the distasteful and indecent manner in which Brett Murray and the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg is displaying the person of comrade President Jacob Zuma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANC to go to court over Zuma painting|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/ANC-to-go-to-court-over-Zuma-painting-20120517|publisher=News24.com|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuma responded to the artwork by saying that it painted him as "a philanderer and a womaniser".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Painting makes me a womaniser - Zuma|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/painting-makes-me-a-womaniser-zuma-1.1300191|accessdate=20 May 2012|newspaper=IOL.co.za|date=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response to the impending legal action, gallery spokesperson Lara Koseff said its lawyers had responded that it would stay until the show was over, citing censorship concerns as central to the decision to allow the exhibition to continue.&lt;ref name="mosomane1"/&gt;  The [[African National Congress Women's League|ANC Women's League]] has also demanded that the exhibition be halted, and all instances of the image be removed from the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Painting violates president's integrity, says ANCWL|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2012/05/19/painting-violates-president-s-integrity-says-ancwl|accessdate=19 May 2012|newspaper=Times Live|date=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stephen|first=Grootes|title=Zuma portrait saga goes to court|url=http://www.ewn.co.za/en/2012/05/19/Zuma%20portrait%20saga%20goes%20to%20court.aspx|accessdate=19 May 2012|newspaper=Eyewitness News|date=19 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602173211/http://ewn.co.za/en/2012/05/19/Zuma%20portrait%20saga%20goes%20to%20court.aspx|archivedate=2 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brett Murray said that his painting had not been intended maliciously, but as "an attempt at humorous satire of political power and patriarchy within the context of other artworks in the exhibition and within the broader context of South African discourse".&lt;ref name=N24Defaced /&gt;

In the first day of legal proceedings, the representative for the ANC, Gcina Malindi, began sobbing and was unable to proceed, causing the process to be adjorned and postponed and the television coverage of the event was suppressed. Later, the ANC sought to drop proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zuma lawyers tears as court hears rude painting case|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18186692|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=BBC News with video|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ANC advocate sobs in court|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ANC-advocate-sobs-in-court-20120524|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=News24|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='South Africa court hears Jacob Zuma obscene painting case|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18182318|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Conway-Smith|first=Erin|title=Jacob Zuma The Spear painting case postponed indefinitely|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/south-africa/120524/the-spear-jacob-zuma-painting-court-case-anc-lawyer|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=GlobalPost|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consequences ===
The ANC's public condemnation of the painting brought widespread local and international attention to the painting, where otherwise it may have remained a relatively obscure piece of work.  For this reason, the action and subsequent fall-out has been characterised as an example of the [[Streisand effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Just Hanging Out|url=http://6000.co.za/just-hanging-out/|publisher=6000 Miles from Civilization|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mahere|first=Fadzayi|title=Why Zuma's Spear should stay up|url=http://www.newzimbabwe.com/opinion-8058-Why+Zumas+Spear+should+stay+up/opinion.aspx|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=New Zimbabwe|date=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, ''The Spear'' has been featured in editorials and news features in all forms of traditional and digital media.

Former ANC leader [[Oliver Tambo]]’s daughter Tselane Tambo was of the opinion that Zuma deserved Murray’s portrayal of him. She wrote on a social networking site, “Do the poor enjoy poverty? Do the unemployed enjoy hopelessness? Do those who can’t get housing enjoy homelessness? He must get over it. No one is having a good time. He should inspire the reverence he craves. This portrait is what he inspired. Shame neh!”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Video: Zuma’s Spear painting sabotage|url=http://www.thesouthafrican.com/news/spear-today-gone-tomorrow.htm|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=The South African .com|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The media boycott of ''City Press'' by the ANC and various public figures led to the newspaper eventually removing the painting from its website on 28 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=de Waal|first=Mandy|title=City Press buckles to ANC demands - and threats|url=http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-05-28-city-press-buckles-to-anc-demands-and-threats|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Daily Maverick|date=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper's editor-in-chief Ferial Haffajee cited several reasons for this decision, including violent threats made to her team by those supporting the boycott.{{or|date=July 2012}}

=== Media boycott ===
After ''City Press'' repeatedly refused to remove an image of the painting off their website, the ANC called upon its members and sympathisers to boycott placing advertising in, and buying of, the weekly paper.  A statement released by the ANC said: "Their refusal to remove this portrait from their website and their controlled social media is a clear indication that this newspaper does not belong to our shared democratic dispensation and values."  Responding to the boycott, ''City Press'' editor-in-chief [[Ferial Haffajee]] described Nzimande's call for a boycott of the paper as "deeply disturbing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boycott 'immoral' ''City Press'', ANC urges|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Boycott-City-Press-the-paragon-of-immorality-ANC-20120524-2|accessdate=25 May 2012|newspaper=News24.co.za|date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ANC was criticised by the South African National Editors' Forum (SANEF),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Zuma genitals row escalates as ANC calls for boycott of newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/25/zuma-genitals-row-anc-newspaper-boycott|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which said "While we recognise the right of the ANC to advise members on how to exercise their consumer decisions, the call for a boycott of a newspaper is tantamount to intimidation and abuse of power ... This kind of behaviour is unbecoming of a party that functions in an open democratic stage and especially one which leads the national government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanef alarmed at call by the ANC to boycott City Press Newspaper (Press release)|url=http://sanef.org.za/news/entry/sanef_alarmed_at_the_call_by_the_anc_to_boycott_city_press_newspaper/|work=South African National Editors' Forum website|accessdate=7 June 2012|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boycott of City Press was further condemned by the [[International Press Institute]] (IPI),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/may/28/southafrica-press-freedom South African newspaper defies ANC boycott call]&lt;/ref&gt; and by 28 May, ten days after the newspaper printed the painting for the first time, opinions in the ANC had divided with several senior members opposing the boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenslade|first=Roy|title=South African newspaper defies ANC boycott call|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/may/28/southafrica-press-freedom|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Greenslade Blog - The Guardian|date=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defacement ==
On the morning of 22 May 2012, two men entered the gallery during visiting hours, and defaced the painting - first by painting a red cross over the depiction of Zuma's face and genitals, and then by smearing black paint over the canvas.  The two men — Barend la Grange and Lowie Mabokela&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2012/05/painting-south-african-presidents-penis-defaced/52698/ |title=Painting of South African President's Penis Defaced |author=Adam Martin |date=23 May 2012 |work=The Atlantic |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; — were arrested by security officials.  This defacement took place whilst court proceedings brought on by the ANC around the right to censor the image were underway.&lt;ref name=N24Defaced&gt;{{cite news|last=Pasley-Banks|first=Carrin|title=Zuma painting defaced at Goodman Gallery|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Zuma-painting-defaced-at-Goodman-Gallery-20120522|accessdate=22 May 2012|publisher=News24|date=22 May 2012|quote=The controversial painting depicting President Jacob Zuma with his genitals exposed was defaced by two men at the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg on Tuesday.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zuma 'penis painting' defaced|url=http://news.iafrica.com/sa/795807.html|accessdate=22 May 2012|newspaper=iafrica.com|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way in which the two men were arrested also drew criticism: Barend la Grange was arrested without any apparent violence, while Lowie Mabokela was head-butted and thrown to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Herskovitz|first=Jon|title=South Africa painting debate exposes racial rifts|url=http://mobile.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSBRE84M04O20120524|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Reuters|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gallery security guard arrested over Zuma painting incident|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2012/05/23/gallery-security-guard-arrested-over-zuma-painting-incident|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Sowetan Live|date=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=Zuma portrait court case reopens South Africa's wounds from apartheid era|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/24/spear-zuma-portrait-court-apartheid|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons==
''The Spear'' portrait has invited comparison to other satirical pieces, including fellow South African artist [[Ayanda Mabulu|Ayanda Mabulu's]] work, ''{{lang|zu|Ngcono ihlwempu kunesibhanxo sesityebi}}'' (Zulu: "Better poor than a rich puppet"), which depicts various regional and international political figures - including Jacob Zuma - in the nude.  The painting received additional attention following the media focus on controversial satirical artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butana|first=Kwanele|title=Cape artist despairs for ‘illiterate’ ANC|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/cape-artist-despairs-for-illiterate-anc-1.1302504|publisher=iol.co.za|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Texan''''' is a [[Western (genre)|western]] [[Television program|television series]] starring popular [[B movie]] actor [[Rory Calhoun]], which aired on the [[CBS]] [[television network]] from 1958 to 1960.

==Overview==
[[File:Rory Calhoun The Texan 1961.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Calhoun as Bill Longley (c. 1960)]]
{{further|List of The Texan episodes}}
In ''The Texan,'' Calhoun played Bill Longley, a  [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] captain from the [[American Civil War]] who on his pinto, Domino, roams the [[Western United States|American West]] but stops to help people in need. A fast gun and the enemy of all lawbreakers, this "Robin Hood of the West" seems to appear nearly everywhere in the post-war years, not just in [[Texas]].&lt;ref name=wtha/&gt;

Often the plots center about Longley helping an old friend or a relative of an old friend. Though known as a fearsome gunfighter, the fictional Bill Longley of ''The Texan'' is in no way the real [[Bill Longley (gunfighter)|Bill Longley]]. That Longley killed his first man in 1866, when he was fifteen, and was [[Hanging|hanged]] in 1878 in [[Giddings, Texas|Giddings]] in [[Lee County, Texas|Lee County]] in [[Central Texas]]. A more accurate version of the real Longley is [[Douglas Kennedy (actor)|Douglas Kennedy]]'s rendition in the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] series, ''[[Stories of the Century]]'', starring and narrated by [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]], and the first western series to win an [[Emmy Award]].&lt;ref name=wtha&gt;Billy Hathorn, "Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 110-112&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Texan'' offers several multi-part episodes. In a four-parter, Longley portrays the boss of a [[cattle drive]]; in another, a railroad construction supervisor. In still another, Longley pursues the bandit El Sombro in the fictitious corrupt community of Rio Nada. In this episode, [[Barbara Stuart]] makes one of her three appearances as [[Poker Alice]], an unlikely frontier [[Gambling|gambler]], the mother of seven children who had once been a dealer at [[Robert Ford (outlaw)|Bob Ford]]'s [[Western saloon|saloon]] in [[Creede, Colorado]], but lived thereafter primarily in [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]] and [[Sturgis, South Dakota]]. Calhoun's then wife, Lita Baron, appeared in several episodes, including a three-parter.&lt;ref name=wtha/&gt;

==Production notes==

With [[Victor Orsatti]], Calhoun formed Rorvic Productions to co-produce ''The Texan'' in partnership with [[Desilu Productions]], the company founded by [[Lucille Ball]] and her first husband, [[Desi Arnaz]]. Then a neighbor of Orsatti's, Arnaz proposed the idea for ''The Texan''. Episodes were budgeted at $40,000 each, with two segments filmed weekly at Desilu Studios. Despite the name, the program was not filmed in Texas but at Pearl Flats in the [[Mohave Desert]] in [[southern California]].&lt;ref name=wtha/&gt;

''The Texan'' ran for only two seasons but could have been extended for a third had Calhoun been willing to continue. However, he wanted to return to films.&lt;ref name=wtha/&gt; In the second half of the second season, ''The Texan'' was preceded on the CBS schedule by [[Kate Smith]]'s return to network television, her unsuccessful ''[[The Kate Smith Show]]''. The first season, sponsored by [[Viceroy (cigarette)|Viceroy]], is considered of better quality because CBS reused in the second season some of the material and footage from the first season. After the 78-episode run, Calhoun returned to starring and co-starring in "B" westerns and making occasional television appearances. [[Louis L'Amour]] wrote teleplays for several episodes, but there were thirty-five writers hired for the series and more than a dozen directors. One of the directors, [[George Archainbaud]], a native of [[Paris]], [[France]], died during the run of ''The Texan''. Other directors were [[Erle C. Kenton]], who began his career in 1914 with [[silent film]]s, and [[Edward Ludwig]], a native of [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=wtha/&gt;

''The Texan'' faced competition in its first season from another western, ''[[The Restless Gun]]'', an [[NBC]] series. Though ''The Restless Gun'' finished in eighth place in the ratings in its first season (1957-1958), ''The Texan'' surpassed it in the 1958-1959 season to finish at #15 while ''The Restless Gun'' fell out of the top 30 and ended its run in 1959. However, ''The Texan'' then also fell out of the top 30 the following season (1959-1960).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960-1961 television season, rebroadcasts of ''The Texan'' ran on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] daytime opposite CBS's ''[[As the World Turns]]'' and [[NBC]]'s ''[[Make Room for Daddy]]'', starring [[Danny Thomas]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4282">'''Vikramkhol''' also spelled '''Bikramkhol''' ({{lang-or|[[:or:ବିକ୍ରମଖୋଲ|'''ବିକ୍ରମଖୋଲ''']]}}) is a prehistoric archaeological site located near [[Jharsuguda]], [[Odisha]] state, [[India]] and lies in Reserved Forest of Belpahar range, at a distance of 12&amp;nbsp;km from Belpahar. The place is known for prehistoric rock art and rock inscriptions dated around 3000 BCE.

==Inscriptions==
The Vikramkhol rock shelter, where the inscriptions found, is dated between 3000 BCE to 4000 BCE.  Details about the caves were first published in [[Indian Antiquary]] in 1935 by the efforts of historian K.P.Jayaswal.&lt;ref name=telegraph1&gt;{{cite news| last1=Mohanty| first1=Subrat| title=Ancient rock art starts to fade out  - Engravings in Vikramkhol cave under threat| url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1111228/jsp/odisha/story_14932470.jsp#.VFjaxjSUep4| accessdate=4 November 2014| work=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]]| location=Kolkotta| date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The inscriptions were studied in 1955.

===Neglect===
Some historians have felt that, due to negligence and apathy by Government agencies, the inscriptions are fading out and damaged by vandals. Activities of coal mines in surrounding hills, industries like sponge iron are putting environmental pressure on this prehistoric archeological site.&lt;ref name=telegraph1/&gt; The rock shelter, where the inscriptions are found, is not fully protected and kept open to atmosphere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Rock Art Shelter of Vikramkhol - Vikramkhol - Jharsuguda| url=http://ignca.nic.in/asp/showbig.asp?projid=orgjhar0020001| publisher=Indira Gandhi National Center for Archeology| accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving scope for vandals and visitors to deface the inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Inscriptions on the Vikramkhol rock shelter in Jharsuguda| url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1111229/jsp/odisha/story_14938763.html| accessdate=4 November 2014| work=The Telegraph| date=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it is located inside Reserve Forest of Belpahar range, the remote access to the place has also contributed to neglect by Government Agencies.&lt;telegraph2/&gt;

The '''Writers' Trust of Canada''', or '''La Société d'encouragement aux écrivains du Canada''', is a charitable organization which provides financial support to Canadian writers.

Founded by [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Pierre Berton]], [[Graeme Gibson]], [[Margaret Laurence]], and [[David Young (Canadian playwright)|David Young]], and registered as a charitable organization on March 3, 1976, the Writers' Trust celebrates and rewards the talents and achievements of Canada's novelists, short story writers, poets, [[Biography|biographers]], and other fiction and nonfiction writers.

The organization funds and administers a number of Canadian [[literary award]]s including the Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize and the Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction, the richest award for [[Non-fiction|nonfiction]] in Canada.

As well, the organization funds scholarships for the [[Humber College]] School for Writers Correspondence Program; an annual ''Margaret Laurence Memorial Lecture'', given by a noted Canadian writer; four annual [[Artist-in-residence|writers' residencies]] at Berton House in [[Dawson City]], Yukon; and the ''Woodcock Fund'', which provides emergency financial assistance to Canadian writers, named in memory of the Canadian poet [[George Woodcock]]. Annual fundraisers include the Writers' Trust Gala in [[Toronto]] and Politics and the Pen in [[Ottawa]]. Money raised to finance the charitable activities of the Writers' Trust is drawn almost exclusively from the [[private sector]].&lt;ref name="CanEncyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/writers-trust-of-canada "The Writers' Trust of Canada"]. ''[[Canadian Encyclopedia]]'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[File:WT medals.jpg|thumb|right|Writers' Trust Medals, given to invited authors at 2011's Gala]]

=== Mission ===
To advance, nurture, and celebrate Canadian writers and writing.

=== Vision ===
To champion excellence in Canadian writing, to improve the status of writers in this country, and to create connections between&amp;nbsp;writers&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;readers.

=== Values ===
#Support Canadian writers as a [[nonpartisan]], [[Nonprofit organization|not-for-profit organization]];
#Value Canadian writers and their works as essential components of our vibrant and diverse culture;
#Nourish professional writers at every stage of their careers;
#Embrace partnerships with readers and organizations dedicated to assisting Canadian writers;
#Welcome openness and flexibility while adhering to the highest standards of fiscal integrity and responsibility.

==Management==
The Writers' Trust of Canada is run by a board of directors composed of volunteers from the arts and business communities, and counseled by an authors' advisory group&lt;ref name="CanEncyclopedia"/&gt; of writers from across the country. Five staff members see to the day-to-day operations out of a downtown Toronto office shared with the&amp;nbsp;[[Writers' Union of Canada]].

[[Juried (competition)|Juries]] are composed of writers based on recommendations by the authors' advisory group; invitations are issued by the administrative staff based upon these recommendations.

==Awards==
Prize winners are announced at the annual Writers' Trust Awards with the following exceptions:
*The Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction is awarded at a separate ceremony.
*The Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing is handed out at Politics and the Pen in Ottawa.
*The RBC Bronwen Wallace Award for Emerging Writers winner is announced separately in the spring.
*The Dayne Ogilvie Prize is presented during [[Pride Week (Toronto)|Toronto's Pride Week]].

All awards are open to [[Canadian nationality law|citizens]] and [[Permanent resident (Canada)|permanent residents]] of Canada. Winners are decided by an independent jury, usually consisting of three prominent writers.

=== Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing ===
The [[Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing]] was established in honour of [[Shaughnessy Cohen]] (1948–1998), an outspoken and popular [[Member&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Parliament]] from [[Windsor, Ontario]]; she died after suffering a [[cerebral&amp;nbsp;hemorrhage]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] just seconds after standing to&amp;nbsp;address&amp;nbsp;her&amp;nbsp;peers.

A prize of {{currency|25,000|CAD}} is given annually to a book of literary nonfiction that captures a political subject of relevance to Canadian readers and has the potential to shape or influence thinking on contemporary Canadian political life. The winning work combines compelling new insights with depth of research and significant literary merit. All finalist works will demonstrate a distinctive voice, as well as a persuasive and compelling command of tone, narrative, style, and analysis. The prize particularly values books which provide the general reader with an informed, unique perspective on the practice of Canadian politics, its players, or its principles. The jurors will [[Short list|shortlist]] between three and five titles. Prizes of {{currency|2,500|CAD}} will be awarded to each of the finalists.

Past winners include [[Jane Jacobs]] for ''[[Dark Age Ahead]]'' and [[James Orbinski]] for ''An Imperfect Offering: Humanitarian Action in the Twenty-first Century''.

=== RBC Bronwen Wallace Award for Emerging Writers ===
The [[RBC Bronwen Wallace Award for Emerging Writers]] was established by author [[Carolyn Smart]] and honours the memory of [[Bronwen Wallace]] (1945&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;1989), a Canadian poet and short story writer who died of cancer at the age of 44.

The {{currency|5,000|CAD}} award alternates each year between short fiction and poetry. As Ms. Wallace's first book was not published until she was 35, the annual award is given to a writer below the age of 35 who has been published in literary journals but has yet to be published in book form. Two finalists also each receive {{currency|1,000|CAD}}. Past winners include [[Jeramy Dodds]] and [[Alison Pick]].

The [[Royal Bank of Canada]] Foundation sponsors the award as part of their RBC Emerging Artists Project, which works to support talented young adults in their development of professional careers in [[the arts]]. In 2008, the prize presentation was moved from the fall to the spring, creating the absence of 2007's award.

=== Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction ===
Consisting of a {{currency|60,000|CAD}} grand prize and {{currency|5,000|CAD}} for each finalist, the [[Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction]] is the most lucrative for Canadian nonfiction literature.&lt;ref name="toronto review"&gt;[http://www.torontoreviewofbooks.com/2011/09/finalists-hilary-weston-writers-trust/ "Finalists for the Hilary Weston Writers’ Trust Nonfiction Prize announced in Toronto"].

[[Image:Etty Youth 1832.jpg|right|upright=1.35|thumb|''Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm'', 1832,  {{convert|158.7|by|117.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}|alt=Naked people on a boat, naked people in the water around the boat, and a flying naked child blowing on the sails of the boat. And two parrots.]]

'''''Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm''''' (also known as '''''Fair Laughs the Morn''''' and '''''Youth and Pleasure''''') is an [[oil painting]] on canvas by English artist [[William Etty]], first exhibited in 1832 and currently in [[Tate Britain]]. Etty had been planning the painting since 1818–19, and an early version was exhibited in 1822. The piece was inspired by a metaphor in [[Thomas Gray]]'s poem ''[[The Bard (poem)|The Bard]]'' in which the apparently bright start to the notorious misrule of [[Richard II of England]] was compared to a gilded ship whose occupants are unaware of an approaching storm. Etty chose to illustrate Gray's lines literally, depicting a golden boat filled with and surrounded by nude and near-nude figures.

Etty felt that his approach to the work illustrated a moral warning about the pursuit of pleasure, but his approach was not entirely successful. ''The Bard'' was about a supposed curse on the [[House of Plantagenet]] placed by a Welsh [[bard]] following [[Edward I of England]]'s attempts to eradicate Welsh culture, and critics felt that Etty had somewhat misunderstood the point of Gray's poem. Some reviewers greatly praised the piece, and in particular Etty's technical abilities, but audiences of the time found it hard to understand the purpose of Etty's painting, and his use of nude figures led some critics to consider the work tasteless and offensive.

The painting was bought in 1832 by [[Robert Vernon (art patron)|Robert Vernon]] to form part of his collection of British art. Vernon donated his collection, including ''Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm'', to the [[National Gallery]] in 1847, which, in turn, transferred it to the [[Tate Gallery]] in 1949. It remains one of Etty's best-known works, and formed part of major exhibitions at Tate Britain in 2001–02 and at the [[York Art Gallery]] in 2011–12.

In 1821 Etty's ''[[The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia]]'' (also known as ''The Triumph of Cleopatra'') was a critical success.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=31}} The painting featured [[Nude (art)|&lt;!-- Normally this would be overlinking, but in this context readers are likely to want to learn more about the tradition of nude art --&gt;nude figures]], and over the following years Etty painted further nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings.&lt;ref name="MAG Etty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/salvaged/the-painting/about-the-artist/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211024806/http://www.manchestergalleries.org/salvaged/the-painting/about-the-artist/index.html|archivedate=2015-02-11|title=About the artist|publisher=Manchester Art Gallery|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited in the 1820s included at least one nude figure.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=32}}

While some nudes existed in private collections, England had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 [[Society for the Suppression of Vice|Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice]].{{sfn|Smith|2001b|p=53}} Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude,{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=57}} and the reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern&lt;!--among whom??--&gt; throughout the 19th century.{{sfn|Smith|2001b|p=55}} Although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received,{{efn-ua|Etty's male nude portraits were primarily of mythological heroes and classical combat, genres in which the depiction of male nudity was considered acceptable in England.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|pp=32–33}}}} many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent.&lt;ref name="MAG Etty" /&gt;{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=32}}

== Composition ==
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|salign=right|quote=&lt;poem&gt;
Fair laughs the morn, and soft the zephyr blows,
While proudly riding o'er the azure realm,
In gallant trim, the gilded vessel goes,
Youth on the prow and Pleasure at the helm,
Unmindful of the sweeping whirlwind's sway,
That, hushed in grim repose, expects his evening prey.
&lt;/poem&gt;|source=Lines from ''The Bard'' which accompanied ''Youth and Pleasure'' when originally exhibited.&lt;ref name="RAcat"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Exhibition of the Royal Academy: The Sixty Fourth|year=1832|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|location=London|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm'' was inspired by a passage in [[Thomas Gray]]'s poem ''[[The Bard (poem)|The Bard]]''.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=128}} The theme of ''The Bard'' was the English king [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s conquest of Wales, and a curse placed by a Welsh [[bard]] upon Edward's descendants after he ordered the execution of all bards and the eradication of Welsh culture.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=128}} Etty used a passage Gray intended to symbolise the seemingly bright start to the disastrous reign of Edward's great-great-grandson [[Richard II of England|Richard II]].{{sfn|Gray|Bradshaw|1891|p=87}}

[[File:William Blake - The Poems of Thomas Gray, Design 60 The Bard 08.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|[[William Blake]]'s treatment ({{circa|1798}}) of the same passage from ''The Bard''. Gray's poem was a popular theme for artists.|alt=A bearded man floats on the sea, with a storm cloud and a sunrise in the background]]

Etty chose to illustrate Gray's words literally, creating what has been described as "a poetic romance".{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=57}} ''Youth and Pleasure'' depicts a small gilded boat. Above the boat, a nude figure representing [[west wind|Zephyr]] blows on the sails. Another nude representing Pleasure lies on a large bouquet of flowers, loosely holding the [[Tiller|helm]] of the boat and allowing Zephyr's breeze to guide it. A nude child blows bubbles, which another nude on the [[prow]] of the ship, representing Youth, reaches to catch. [[Naiad]]s, again nude, swim around and clamber on the boat.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=128}} Although the seas are calm, a "sweeping whirlwind" is forming on the horizon, with a demonic figure within the storm clouds.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=128}}&lt;ref name="Gent1832"&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 1832|title=Fine Arts.—Royal Academy|journal=The Gentleman's Magazine|publisher=J. B. Nichols and Son|location=London|volume=33|issue=6|page=539}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Deterioration and restoration means this demonic figure is now barely visible.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=128}}) The intertwined limbs of the participants were intended to evoke the sensation of transient and passing pleasure, and to express the themes of female sexual appetites entrapping innocent youth,{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=67}} and the sexual power women hold over men.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=57}}

Etty said of his approach to the text that he was hoping to create "a general allegory of Human Life, its empty vain pleasures—if not founded on the laws of Him who is the Rock of Ages."{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=180}} While Etty felt that the work conveyed a clear moral warning about the pursuit of pleasure, this lesson was largely lost upon its audiences.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=57}}

When Etty exhibited the completed painting at the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] in 1832,{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=24}} it was shown untitled,&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Royal Academy |day_of_week=Thursday |date=24 May 1832 |page_number=3 |issue=14860 |column=F }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the relevant six lines from ''The Bard'' attached;{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=128}} writers at the time sometimes referred to it by its [[incipit]] of ''Fair Laughs the Morn''.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;{{efn-ua|Etty's 2007 biographer Leonard Robinson states that much of this verse was omitted, and the painting was captioned ''Fair laughs the Morn, and soft the Zephyr blows, Youth on the prow, and Pleasure at the helm, That hush'd in grim repose, expects his evening prey''.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=180}} The original catalogue for the 1832 Summer Exhibition clearly indicates that all six lines accompanied the painting on its original exhibition.&lt;ref name="RAcat" /&gt;}} By the time of Etty's death in 1849, it had acquired its present title of ''Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 1850|title=Obituary.—William Etty, Esq, R.A.|journal=The Gentleman's Magazine|publisher=John Bower Nichols and Son|location=London|volume=33|issue=1|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versions ==
[[File:Etty Youth 1822.png|right|thumb|The 1822 version of the painting provoked a strong reaction from ''The Times'' for its supposed indecency.|alt=Gold boat full of naked people]]
[[File:Etty – Three Female Nudes.jpeg|right|thumb|''Three Female Nudes'', attributed to Etty, {{circa|1820}}, is possibly either a study for or derived from ''Youth and Pleasure'', but may be a study for an unrelated work.|alt=three nude women on a rock, with a sea serpent coiling around the rock.]]

The final version of ''Youth and Pleasure'' was painted between 1830 and 1832,&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/etty-youth-on-the-prow-and-pleasure-at-the-helm-n00356|title=William Etty – Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm|publisher=[[Tate]]|date=May 2007|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Etty had been contemplating a painting on the theme since 1818–19.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=158}} In 1822 he had exhibited an early version at the [[British Institution]] titled ''A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes (Youth on the Prow)'';{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=22}}{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=178}} in this version the group of figures on the prow is reversed, and the swimmers around the boat are absent.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=158}} Another rough version of the painting also survives, similar to the 1832 version but again with the figures on the prow reversed.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=159}} This version was exhibited at a retrospective of Etty's work at the [[Society of Arts]] in 1849; it is dated 1848 but this is likely to be a misprint of 1828, making it a preliminary study for the 1832 painting.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=159}}

Although it received little notice when first exhibited, the 1822 version provoked a strong reaction from ''[[The Times]]'':

{{quote|We take this opportunity of advising Mr. Etty, who got some reputation for painting "Cleopatra's Galley", not to be seduced into a style which can gratify only the most vicious taste. Naked figures, when painted with the purity of Raphael, may be endured: but nakedness without purity is offensive and indecent, and on Mr.&amp;nbsp;Etty's {{sic|hide=y|canvass}} is mere dirty flesh. Mr.&amp;nbsp;Howard,{{efn-ua|[[Henry Howard (artist)|Henry Howard]], one of Etty's rivals in the field of history painting.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=31}}}} whose poetical subjects sometimes require naked figures, never disgusts the eye or mind. Let Mr.&amp;nbsp;Etty strive to acquire a taste equally pure: he should know, that just delicate taste and pure moral sense are synonymous terms.|''The Times'', 29 January 1822&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Lord Gwydyr |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=29 January 1822 |page_number=3 |issue=11466 |column=A }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An [[oil sketch]] attributed to Etty, given to York Art Gallery in 1952 by [[Judith Hare, Countess of Listowel]] and entitled ''Three Female Nudes'', is possibly a preliminary study by Etty for ''Youth and Pleasure'', or a copy by a student of the three central figures.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=159}} Art historian Sarah Burnage considers both possibilities unlikely, as neither the arrangement of figures, the subject matter or the [[sea serpent]] approaching the group appear to relate to the completed ''Youth and Pleasure'', and considers it more likely to be a preliminary sketch for a now-unknown work.{{sfn|Burnage|2011c|p=215}}

== Reception ==
''Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm'' met with a mixed reception on exhibition, and while critics generally praised Etty's technical ability, there was a certain confusion as to what the painting was actually intended to represent and a general feeling that he had seriously misunderstood what ''The Bard'' was actually about.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=128}} ''The Library of the Fine Arts'' felt "in classical design, anatomical drawing, elegance of attitude, fineness of form, and gracefulness of grouping, no doubt Mr. Etty has no superior", and while "the representation of the ideas in the lines quoted [from ''The Bard''] are beautifully and accurately expressed upon the canvas" they considered "the ulterior reference of the poet [to the destruction of Welsh culture and the decline of the [[House of Plantagenet]]] was entirely lost sight of, and that, if this be the nearest that Art can approach in conveying to the eye the happy exemplification of the subject which Gray intended, we fear we must give up the contest upon the merits of poetry and painting."&lt;ref name="Library1832"&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 1832|title=Exhibition of the Royal Academy|journal=Library of the Fine Arts|volume=4|issue=18|publisher=M. Arnold|location=London|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns were raised in ''The Times'', which observed that it was "Full of beauty, rich in colouring, boldly and accurately drawn, and composed with a most graceful fancy; but the meaning of it, if it has any meaning, no man can tell", pointing out that although it was intended to illustrate Gray it "would represent almost as well any other poet's fancies."&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; ''[[The Examiner (1808–86)|The Examiner]]'', meanwhile, took issue with the cramped and overladen boat, pointing out that the characters "if not exactly jammed together like figs in a basket, are sadly constrained for want of room", and also complained that the boat would not in reality "float half the weight which is made to press upon it."{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=128}}

Other reviewers were kinder; ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' praised Etty's ability to capture "the beauty of the proportion of the antique", noting that in the central figures "there is far more of classicality than is to be seen in almost any modern picture", and considered the overall composition "a most fortunate combination of the ideality of Poetry and the reality of Nature".&lt;ref name="Gent1832" /&gt; The ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenæum]]'' considered it "a poetic picture from a very poetic passage", praising Etty for "telling a story which is very difficult to tell with the pencil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=26 May 1832|title=Fine Arts; Exhibition at Somerset House|journal=The Athenæum|publisher=J. Holmes|location=London|issue=239|page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest criticism of ''Youth and Pleasure'' came from ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]'', a newspaper which had long disliked Etty's female nudes.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=33}} It complained "no decent family can hang such sights against their wall",{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=129}} and condemned the painting as an "indulgence of what we once hoped a classical, but which are now convinced, is a lascivious mind", commenting "the course of [Etty's] studies should run in a purer channel, and that he should not persist, with an unhallowed fancy, to pursue Nature to her holy recesses. He is a laborious draughtsman, and a beautiful colourist; but he has not taste or chastity of mind enough to venture on the naked truth." The reviewer added "we fear that Mr.&amp;nbsp;E will never turn from his wicked ways, and make himself fit for decent company."{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=33}}

== Legacy ==
[[File:Youth &amp; Pleasure handbill.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Gratuitous nudity made ''Youth and Pleasure'' a popular piece for [[tableau vivant]] performances, at the time the only form of live entertainment in which nudity was permitted.|alt=Handbill advertising "Madame Warton's performance of Youth on the Prow and Pleasure at the Helm"]]
''Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm'' was purchased at the time of its exhibition by [[Robert Vernon (art patron)|Robert Vernon]] for his important collection of British art.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=57}}{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=158}} (The price Vernon paid for ''Youth and Pleasure'' is not recorded, although Etty's cashbook records a partial payment of £250—about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|250|1832|r=-3}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}—so it is likely to have been a substantial sum.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=159}}) Vernon later purchased [[John Constable]]'s ''The Valley Farm'', planning to hang it in the place then occupied by ''Youth and Pleasure''. This decision caused Constable to comment "My picture is to go into the place—where Etty's "[[Bumboat]]" is at present—his picture with its precious freight is to be brought down nearer to the nose."{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=57}}{{efn-ua|Art historians differ in their interpretation of Constable's reaction, and whether he was expressing surprise or pleasure that Vernon was moving ''Youth and Pleasure'' to a less prominent position to make way for ''The Valley Farm''.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=57}}{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=181}}}} Vernon presented his collection to the nation in 1847, and his 157 paintings, including ''Youth and Pleasure'', entered the [[National Gallery]].{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=388}}

When [[Samuel Carter Hall]] was choosing works to illustrate his newly launched ''[[The Art Journal]]'', he considered it important to promote new British artists, even if it meant illustrations which some readers considered pornographic or offensive. In 1849 Hall secured reproduction rights to the paintings Vernon had given to the nation and soon published and widely distributed an engraving of the painting under the title ''Youth and Pleasure'',{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=181}} describing it as "of the very highest class".{{sfn|Smith|1996|p=69}}

Needled by repeated attacks from the press on his supposed indecency, poor taste and lack of creativity, Etty changed his approach after the response to ''Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm''.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=36}} He exhibited over 80 further paintings at the Royal Academy alone, and remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from this time made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=42}} He died in November 1849 and, while his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity, interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century all of his paintings had fallen below their original prices.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=440}}

In 1949 the painting was transferred from the National Gallery to the [[Tate Gallery]],{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=158}} where {{asof|2015|lc=y}} it remains.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt; Although ''Youth and Pleasure'' is one of Etty's best-known paintings,{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=63}} it remains controversial, and Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty describes it as "singularly inept".{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=63}} It was one of five works by Etty chosen for [[Tate Britain]]'s landmark ''Exposed: The Victorian Nude'' exhibition in 2001–02,{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=57}} and also formed part of a major retrospective of Etty's work at the [[York Art Gallery]] in 2011–12.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=128}}
