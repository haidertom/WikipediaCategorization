      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1194">'''AQH Share''' is a statistic that measures [[radio broadcasting|broadcast radio]] listenership. 
==Definition==

'''AQH''' is an abbreviation for Average Quarter-Hour Persons (AQH Persons), defined by [[Arbitron]] (now referred to as Nielsen Audio) as the average number of persons listening to a particular station for at least five minutes during a 15-minute period.

'''Share''' is the percentage of those listening to radio in an Arbitron "market" (typically a [[metropolitan area]]) who are listening to a particular radio station.

Thus, '''AQH Share''' for a given station is mathematically expressed as ''[AQH Persons listening to station / AQH Persons listening to all market radio stations] * 100''.

==Usage==

AQH Share is most often used in conjunction with [[Time spent listening|TSL]] (Time Spent Listening) to measure listenership in a market. While AQH measures the average number of listeners to the station, TSL tracks the length of time listeners are tuned continuously to the station.

'''Angelo Massimino''' ([[Catania]], 1927 — [[Scillato]], March 4, 1996) was an [[Italy|Italian]] entrepreneur and [[football (soccer)|football]] owner, who served as chairman of [[Calcio Catania]] for almost 25 years.

A [[Sicily|Sicilian]] emigrant who made his fortune in [[Argentina]], returned in Catania during the 1950s and, together with his brothers, founded in 1962 an amateur football club called ''Massiminiana'', leading them up to [[Serie C]], where they played for four consecutive seasons. In 1968, he became the owner of Calcio Catania, and immediately invested in his new club, obtaining a promotion to [[Serie A]] only one year later. He then resigned in 1972, following immediate relegation to Serie B followed by two poor seasons in the second-highest national division, but returned to serve as chairman two years later, immediately obtaining a second promotion. During the following years, Catania proved to be a [[yo-yo club|yo-yo team]], playing in all of the three highest national division, making a one-year comeback to Serie A in 1983. He left the club in 1987 following relegation to [[Serie C1]] and criticisms by the local supporters. He however returned once again in 1992 to save the club from bankruptcy, but was unable to avoid a controversial cancellation of his club one year later. The club cancellation was later declared invalid by the Italian magistrature, and Catania was readmitted to Italian football, namely into the [[Eccellenza]] regional league, and immediately started to rise the football league pyramid with two consecutive promotions, despite Massimino's partial blindness and worsening health caused by [[diabetes]]. Angelo Massimino died in 1996, aged 69, in a road accident on the Palermo-Catania highway. His funeral in Catania was attended by over a thousand people.

Massimino is still remembered by Catania supporters as their most representative chairman, and the local stadium, formerly known as ''Cibali'', was named after him in 2002. He was also nationally known for his poor [[Italian language]] skills, heavily influenced by his Sicilian heritage, and several blunders who made him popular among Italian football fans.

'''{{lang|da|Anpartsselskab}}''' ('''ApS''') is the [[Denmark|Danish]] term for a [[private limited company]]. ApS, when appended to the end of a Danish company name, is similar to [[Ltd.]] after the name of a British company. An ApS is required to have capital of at least 50,000 [[Danish krone|DKK]] (8,220 [[Euro]]s).

The Australian [[corporate tax|company tax]] rate has varied over time. It has been a [[flat rate]] and reached its peak of 49%. Before 1987, Australia had the classical dividend taxation system, whereby a company's profit would be taxed at the company tax rate and a shareholder would be taxed on a dividend received, giving raise to what is described as [[double taxation]]. In 1987, the [[Australian dividend imputation system]] was introduced to stop the double taxation,&lt;ref&gt;Act No. 59 of 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and to create a "level playing field". The company tax rate was reduced to 39% in 1988 and 33% in 1993, and increased again in 1995 to 36%, to be reduced to 34% in 2000 and 30% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/factcheck/2016-06-29/fact-check-labor-on-corporate-tax-cuts/7549754|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|title=Fact check: Did Labor previously make the same arguments as the Government on company tax?|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 2015/16, designated "small business entities" with an aggregated annual turnover threshold of less than $2 million were eligible for a lower tax rate of 28.5%. Since 1 July 2016, small business entities with aggregated annual turnover of less than $10 million have had a reduced company tax rate of 27.5%. Additionally, the Australian Government announced that from 2017/18, corporate entities eligible for the lower tax rate will be known as "base rate entities". The small business definition will remain at $10 million from 2017/18 onwards, however the base rate entity threshold (the aggregated annual turnover threshold under which entities will be eligible to pay a lower tax rate) will continue to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Direct-taxes/Income-tax-for-businesses/Reducing-the-corporate-tax-rate/|title=Reducing the corporate tax rate|date=4 July 2017|publisher=Australian Taxation Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dividend imputation ==
{{main|Australian dividend imputation system}}
Australia introduced a dividend imputation system in 1987, making the company tax rate less relevant, especially on company profits distributed to [[Income tax in Australia#Residency for tax purposes|Australian-resident shareholders]] in the form of franked dividends.

Australian companies that have paid Australian company tax can declare how much of the tax paid is to be imputed or associated with any dividend it pays. Dividends with the maximum imputed tax amount is called a franked dividend, while any other dividend is unfranked. Australian-resident shareholders who receive franked dividends from Australian companies would declare both the dividends and the imputation credits on their tax returns, but are entitled to claim back a tax credit (called a franking credit) on those imputed tax credits. The franking credits associated with such dividends are a tax credit against the shareholder's tax liability. Initially, in 1987, excess franking credits over the tax liability were lost, but since 2000 such excess credits have been refundable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Investing/In-detail/Investing-in-shares/Refunding-franking-credits---individuals/|title=Refunding excess franking credits – individuals|date=28 June 2017|publisher=Australian Taxation Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, the Australian shareholder receives a reimbursement of the company tax paid, and the company profit is taxed at the shareholders’ marginal tax rates. Company profits not distributed are taxed at the company tax rate, until such retained profits are distributed.

Non-resident shareholders are not entitled to claim a tax credit or refund of imputation credits. Unfranked dividends received by non-residents are subject to a [[withholding tax]], which does not apply to franked dividends.

==History==
[[File:The Brewer designed and engraved in the Sixteenth. Century by J Amman.png|upright|thumb|[[Brewing]] was an early application of biotechnology]]

{{Main|History of biotechnology}}

Although not normally what first comes to mind, many forms of human-derived [[agriculture]] clearly fit the broad definition of "'utilizing a biotechnological system to make products".  Indeed, the cultivation of plants may be viewed as the earliest biotechnological enterprise.

[[Agriculture]] has been theorized to have become the dominant way of producing food since the [[Neolithic Revolution]].  Through early biotechnology, the earliest farmers selected and bred the best suited crops, having the highest yields, to produce enough food to support a growing population.  As crops and fields became increasingly large and difficult to maintain, it was discovered that specific organisms and their by-products could effectively [[fertilize]], [[nitrogen fixation|restore nitrogen]], and [[pesticide|control pests]]. Throughout the history of agriculture, farmers have inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to new environments and [[plant breeding|breeding]] them with other plants — one of the first forms of biotechnology.

These processes also were included in early [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of [[beer]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book | last = Arnold | first = John P.  | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2005 | title = Origin and History of Beer and Brewing: From Prehistoric Times to the Beginning of Brewing Science and Technology | location = Cleveland, Ohio | publisher = BeerBooks | page = 34 | isbn = 978-0-9662084-1-2 | oclc = 71834130 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; These processes were introduced in early [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], [[China]] and [[India]], and still use the same basic biological methods.  In [[brewing]], malted grains (containing [[enzymes]]) convert starch from grains into sugar and then adding specific [[yeasts]] to produce beer. In this process, [[carbohydrates]] in the grains broke down into alcohols, such as ethanol. Later, other cultures produced the process of [[lactic acid fermentation]], which produced other preserved foods, such as [[soy sauce]]. Fermentation was also used in this time period to produce [[leavened bread]]. Although the process of fermentation was not fully understood until [[Louis Pasteur]]'s work in 1857, it is still the first use of biotechnology to convert a food source into another form.

Before the time of [[Charles Darwin]]'s work and life, animal and plant scientists had already used selective breeding. Darwin added to that body of work with his scientific observations about the ability of science to change species. These accounts contributed to Darwin's theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404200058.html|title = Biotechnology|last = Cole-Turner|first = Ronald | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2003|journal = Encyclopedia of Science and Religion|access-date = December 7, 2014|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For thousands of years, humans have used selective breeding to improve production of crops and livestock to use them for food. In selective breeding, organisms with desirable characteristics are mated to produce offspring with the same characteristics. For example, this technique was used with corn to produce the largest and sweetest crops.&lt;ref name=Thieman&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Thieman WJ, Palladino MA |title=Introduction to Biotechnology |publisher=Pearson/Benjamin Cummings |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-321-49145-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early twentieth century scientists gained a greater understanding of [[microbiology]] and explored ways of manufacturing specific products. In 1917, [[Chaim Weizmann]] first used a pure microbiological culture in an industrial process, that of manufacturing [[corn starch]] using ''[[Clostridium acetobutylicum]],'' to produce [[acetone]], which the [[United Kingdom]] desperately needed to manufacture [[explosive]]s during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name="Springham_biotechnology"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Springham D, Springham G, Moses V, Cape RE |title=Biotechnology: The Science and the Business |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GY5DCr6LD4C |date=August 24, 1999 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-90-5702-407-8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotechnology has also led to the development of antibiotics. In 1928, [[Alexander Fleming]] discovered the mold ''[[Penicillium]]''. His work led to the purification of the antibiotic compound formed by the mold by Howard Florey, Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley – to form what we today know as [[penicillin]]. In 1940, penicillin became available for medicinal use to treat bacterial infections in humans.&lt;ref name=Thieman/&gt;

The field of modern biotechnology is generally thought of as having been born in 1971 when Paul Berg's (Stanford) experiments in gene splicing had early success.  Herbert W. Boyer (Univ. Calif. at San Francisco) and Stanley N. Cohen (Stanford) significantly advanced the new technology in 1972 by transferring genetic material into a bacterium, such that the imported material would be reproduced.  The commercial viability of a biotechnology industry was significantly expanded on June 16, 1980, when the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that a [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] [[microorganism]] could be [[patent]]ed in the case of ''[[Diamond v. Chakrabarty]]''.&lt;ref name="DiamondvChakrabarty"&gt;"[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=447&amp;invol=303 Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980). No. 79-139]."

Retrieved on May 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Indian-born Ananda Chakrabarty, working for [[General Electric]], had modified a bacterium (of the genus ''[[Pseudomonas]]'') capable of breaking down crude oil, which he proposed to use in treating oil spills.  (Chakrabarty's work did not involve gene manipulation but rather the transfer of entire organelles between strains of the ''Pseudomonas'' bacterium.

Revenue in the industry is expected to grow by 12.9% in 2008.{{Update|section|date=October 2018}} Another factor influencing the biotechnology sector's success is improved intellectual property rights legislation—and enforcement—worldwide, as well as strengthened demand for medical and pharmaceutical products to cope with an ageing, and ailing, U.S. population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080402034432/http://www.ibisworld.com/pressrelease/pressrelease.aspx?prid=115 VoIP Providers And Corn Farmers Can Expect To Have Bumper Years In 2008 And Beyond, According To The Latest Research Released By Business Information Analysts At IBISWorld]. Los Angeles (March 19, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising demand for biofuels is expected to be good news for the biotechnology sector, with the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] estimating [[ethanol]] usage could reduce U.S. petroleum-derived fuel consumption by up to 30% by 2030. The biotechnology sector has allowed the U.S. farming industry to rapidly increase its supply of corn and soybeans—the main inputs into biofuels—by developing genetically modified seeds that resist pests and drought. By increasing farm productivity, biotechnology boosts biofuel production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-technology-1/The-Recession-List---Top-10-Industries-to-Fly-and-Flop-in-2008-4076-3/ The Recession List — Top 10 Industries to Fly and Fl...

Biotechnology has applications in four major industrial areas, including health care (medical), crop production and agriculture, non-food (industrial) uses of crops and other products (e.g. [[biodegradable plastic]]s, [[vegetable oil]], [[biofuel]]s), and environmental uses.

For example, one application of biotechnology is the directed use of [[organism]]s for the manufacture of organic products (examples include [[beer]] and [[milk]] products). Another example is using naturally present [[bacteria]] by the mining industry in [[bioleaching]]. Biotechnology is also used to recycle, treat waste, clean up sites contaminated by industrial activities ([[bioremediation]]), and also to produce [[biological warfare|biological weapons]].

A series of derived terms have been coined to identify several branches of biotechnology, for example:
* [[Bioinformatics]] (also called "gold biotechnology) is an interdisciplinary field that addresses biological problems using computational techniques, and makes the rapid organization as well as analysis of biological data possible. The field may also be referred to as ''computational biology'', and can be defined as, "conceptualizing biology in terms of molecules and then applying informatics techniques to understand and organize the information associated with these molecules, on a large scale."&lt;ref name="gerstein"&gt;Gerstein, M.

* Green biotechnology is biotechnology applied to agricultural processes. An example would be the selection and domestication of plants via [[micropropagation]]. Another example is the designing of [[transgenic plant]]s to grow under specific environments in the presence (or absence) of chemicals. One hope is that green biotechnology might produce more environmentally friendly solutions than traditional [[industrial agriculture]]. An example of this is the engineering of a plant to express a [[pesticide]], thereby ending the need of external application of pesticides. An example of this would be [[Transgenic maize|Bt corn]]. Whether or not green biotechnology products such as this are ultimately more environmentally friendly is a topic of considerable debate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kafarski, P. (2012).

* White biotechnology, also known as industrial biotechnology, is biotechnology applied to [[Industry|industrial]] processes. An example is the designing of an organism to produce a useful chemical. Another example is the using of [[enzymes]] as industrial [[catalyst]]s to either produce valuable chemicals or destroy hazardous/polluting chemicals. White biotechnology tends to consume less in resources than traditional processes used to produce industrial goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frazzetto G | title = White biotechnology | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = 835–7 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12949582 | pmc = 1326365 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.embor928 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Frazzetto, G.

* "Yellow biotechnology" refers to the use of biotechnology in food production, for example in making wine, cheese, and beer by [[fermentation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It has also been used to refer to biotechnology applied to insects. This includes biotechnology-based approaches for the control of harmful insects, the characterisation and utilisation of active ingredients or genes of insects for research, or application in agriculture and medicine and various other approaches.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;[https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-642-39863-6 Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology], Volume 135 2013, Yellow Biotechnology I&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gray biotechnology is dedicated to environmental applications, and focused on the maintenance of [[biodiversity]] and the remotion of pollutants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Brown biotechnology is related to the management of arid lands and [[desert]]s. One application is the creation of enhanced seeds that resist extreme [[desert climate|environmental conditions]] of arid regions, which is related to the innovation, creation of agriculture techniques and management of resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Medicine===
In medicine, modern biotechnology has many applications in areas such as [[pharmaceutical drug]] discoveries and production, [[pharmacogenomics]], and genetic testing (or genetic screening).
[[File:Microarray2.gif|thumb|[[DNA microarray]] chip – some can do as many as a million blood tests at once ]]

[[Pharmacogenomics]] (a combination of [[pharmacology]] and [[genomics]]) is the technology that analyses how genetic makeup affects an individual's response to drugs.&lt;ref&gt;Ermak G. (2013) ''Modern Science &amp; Future Medicine'' (second edition)&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with the influence of [[genetics|genetic]] variation on drug responses in patients by correlating [[gene expression]] or [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s with a drug's [[efficacy]] or [[toxicity]].&lt;ref name="pmid20836007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang L | title = Pharmacogenomics: a systems approach | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Systems Biology and Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–22 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20836007 | pmc = 3894835 | doi = 10.1002/wsbm.42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By doing so, pharmacogenomics aims to develop rational means to optimize drug therapy, with respect to the patients' [[genotype]], to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]].&lt;ref name="pmid19530963"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Becquemont L | title = Pharmacogenomics of adverse drug reactions: practical applications and perspectives | journal = Pharmacogenomics | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 961–9 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19530963 | doi = 10.2217/pgs.09.37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such approaches promise the advent of "[[personalized medicine]]"; in which drugs and drug combinations are optimized for each individual's unique genetic makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126957.pdf|format=PDF|title=Guidance for Industry Pharmacogenomic Data Submissions|date=March 2005|publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]|access-date=August 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20712531"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Squassina A, Manchia M, Manolopoulos VG, Artac M, Lappa-Manakou C, Karkabouna S, Mitropoulos K, Del Zompo M, Patrinos GP | title = Realities and expectations of pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine: impact of translating genetic knowledge into clinical practice | journal = Pharmacogenomics | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 1149–67 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20712531 | doi = 10.2217/pgs.10.97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotechnology has contributed to the discovery and manufacturing of traditional [[small molecule]] [[pharmaceutical drugs]] as well as drugs that are the product of biotechnology – [[biopharmaceutics]]. Modern biotechnology can be used to manufacture existing medicines relatively easily and cheaply. The first genetically engineered products were medicines designed to treat human diseases. To cite one example, in 1978 [[Genentech]] developed synthetic humanized [[insulin]] by joining its gene with a [[plasmid]] vector inserted into the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. Insulin, widely used for the treatment of diabetes, was previously extracted from the pancreas of [[abattoir]] animals (cattle or pigs). The resulting genetically engineered bacterium enabled the production of vast quantities of synthetic human insulin at relatively low cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Bains W |title=Genetic Engineering For Almost Everybody: What Does It Do?

The application of biotechnology to basic science (for example through the [[Human Genome Project]]) has also dramatically improved our understanding of [[biology]] and as our scientific knowledge of normal and disease biology has increased, our ability to develop new medicines to treat previously untreatable diseases has increased as well.&lt;ref name=USIS/&gt;

[[Genetic testing]] allows the [[Genetics|genetic]] [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of vulnerabilities to inherited [[diseases]], and can also be used to determine a child's parentage (genetic mother and father) or in general a person's [[ancestry]]. In addition to studying [[chromosomes]] to the level of individual genes, genetic testing in a broader sense includes [[biochemical]] tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases, or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders.  Genetic testing identifies changes in [[chromosomes]], genes, or proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/testing/genetictesting |title=What is genetic testing? – Genetics Home Reference |publisher=Ghr.nlm.nih.gov |date=May 30, 2011 |access-date=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the time, testing is used to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders. The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a [[genetic disorder]]. As of 2011 several hundred genetic tests were in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/genetictesting.html |title=Genetic Testing: MedlinePlus |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov |access-date=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogentest.org/patient/public_health/info/public/unit3/DefinitionsGeneticTesting-3rdDraf18Jan07.xhtml |title=Definitions of Genetic Testing |access-date=August 10, 2008 |work=Definitions of Genetic Testing (Jorge Sequeiros and Bárbara Guimarães) |publisher=EuroGentest Network of Excellence Project |date=September 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204181251/http://eurogentest.org/patient/public_health/info/public/unit3/DefinitionsGeneticTesting-3rdDraf18Jan07.xhtml |archive-date=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since genetic testing may open up ethical or psychological problems, genetic testing is often accompanied by [[genetic counseling]].

===Agriculture===

[[Genetically modified crops]] ("GM crops", or "biotech crops") are plants used in [[agriculture]], the [[DNA]] of which has been modified with [[genetic engineering]] techniques.  In most cases, the main aim is to introduce a new [[trait (biology)|trait]] that does not occur naturally in the species.

[[Genetically modified food]]s are foods produced from [[organism]]s that have had specific changes introduced into their [[DNA]] with the methods of [[genetic engineering]]. These techniques have allowed for the introduction of new crop traits as well as a far greater control over a food's genetic structure than previously afforded by methods such as [[selective breeding]] and [[mutation breeding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file15655.pdf GM Science Review First Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016100707/http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file15655.pdf |date=October 16, 2013 }}, Prepared by the UK GM Science Review panel (July 2003).

==={{visible anchor|Industrial|Industrial biotechnology}}===
Industrial biotechnology (known mainly in Europe as white biotechnology) is the application of biotechnology for industrial purposes, including [[industrial fermentation]]. It includes the practice of using [[Cell (biology)|cells]] such as [[micro-organisms]], or components of cells like [[enzyme]]s, to generate [[Industry|industrially]] useful products in sectors such as chemicals, food and feed, detergents, paper and pulp, textiles and [[biofuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/media/documents/pdf/Energy_Environment/Industrial_biotech_and_biomass_utilisation_EGM_report.pdf Industrial Biotechnology and Biomass Utilisation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405175248/http://www.unido.org/fileadmin/media/documents/pdf/Energy_Environment/Industrial_biotech_and_biomass_utilisation_EGM_report.pdf |date=April 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the current decades, significant progress has been done in creating [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified organisms (GMOs)]] that enhance the diversity of applications and economical viability of industrial biotechnology. By using renewable raw materials to produce a variety of chemicals and fuels, industrial biotechnology is actively advancing towards lowering greenhouse gas emissions and moving away from a petrochemical-based economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovationeu.org/news/innovation-eu-vol2-1/0262-industrial-biotechnology.html Industrial biotechnology, A powerful, innovative technology to mitigate climate change]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental===

The environment can be affected by biotechnologies, both positively and adversely. Vallero and others have argued that the difference between beneficial biotechnology (e.g.bioremediation is to clean up an oil spill or hazard chemical leak) versus the adverse effects stemming from biotechnological enterprises (e.g. flow of genetic material from transgenic organisms into wild strains) can be seen as applications and implications, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel A. Vallero]], ''Environmental Biotechnology: A Biosystems Approach'', Academic Press, Amsterdam, NV; {{ISBN|978-0-12-375089-1}}; 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Cleaning up environmental wastes is an example of an application of environmental biotechnology; whereas [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] or loss of containment of a harmful microbe are examples of environmental implications of biotechnology.

===Regulation===
{{main|Regulation of genetic engineering|Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms}}

The regulation of genetic engineering concerns approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the use of [[genetic engineering]] technology, and the development and release of genetically modified organisms (GMO), including [[genetically modified crops]] and [[genetically modified fish]]. There are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaskell G, Bauer MW, Durant J, Allum NC | title = Worlds apart? The reception of genetically modified foods in Europe and the U.S | journal = Science | volume = 285 | issue = 5426 | pages = 384–7 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10411496 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.285.5426.384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering.  For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety.&lt;ref name=PotatoPro&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.potatopro.com/newsletters/20100310.htm | title = The History and Future of GM Potatoes | date = March 10, 2010 | work = Potato Pro }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union differentiates between approval for cultivation within the EU and approval for import and processing. While only a few GMOs have been approved for cultivation in the EU a number of GMOs have been approved for import and processing.&lt;ref name="Wesseler-2011"&gt;{{cite book | author-link1 = Justus Wesseler | vauthors = Wesseler J, Kalaitzandonakes N | year = 2011 | chapter = Present and Future EU GMO policy | pages = 23–332 | veditors = Oskam A, Meesters G, Silvis H | title = EU Policy for Agriculture, Food and Rural Areas | edition = 2nd | location = Wageningen | publisher = Wageningen Academic Publishers }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultivation of GMOs has triggered a debate about coexistence of GM and non GM crops. Depending on the coexistence regulations, incentives for cultivation of GM crops differ.&lt;ref name="Beckman-2011"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Beckmann VC, Soregaroli J, Wesseler J | author-link3 = Justus Wesseler | year = 2011 | chapter = Coexistence of genetically modified (GM) and non-modified (non GM) crops: Are the two main property rights regimes equivalent with respect to the coexistence value? | title = Genetically modified food and global welfare | veditors = Carter C, Moschini G, Sheldon I | pages = 201–224 | volume = 10 | series = Frontiers of Economics and Globalization Series | location = Bingley, UK | publisher = Emerald Group Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning==
In 1988, after prompting from the [[United States Congress]], the [[National Institute of General Medical Sciences]] ([[National Institutes of Health]]) (NIGMS) instituted a funding mechanism for biotechnology training. Universities nationwide compete for these funds to establish Biotechnology Training Programs (BTPs). Each successful application is generally funded for five years then must be competitively renewed. [[Graduate students]] in turn compete for acceptance into a BTP; if accepted, then stipend, tuition and health insurance support is provided for two or three years during the course of their [[Ph.D.]] thesis work. Nineteen institutions offer NIGMS supported BTPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/InstPredoc/Pages/PredocDesc-Biotechnology.aspx|title = Biotechnology Predoctoral Training Program|date = December 18, 2013|access-date = October 28, 2014|website = National Institute of General Medical Sciences|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biotechnology training is also offered at the undergraduate level and in community colleges.

'''Sir Robert Edward Jones''' (born 24 November 1939),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=Max|title=Who's Who in New Zealand|edition=12th|origyear=1908|year=1991|publisher=Reed|location=Wellington|isbn=0790001306}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as '''Sir Bob Jones''', is a property investor, author and former [[politician]] in New Zealand.

==Biography==
Jones, born in 1939, is (by 15 years) the older brother of prizewinning author [[Lloyd Jones (New Zealand author)|Lloyd Jones]].&lt;ref name="Bob and Lloyd"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bob and Lloyd Jones|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/features/profiles/35726/Bob-and-Lloyd-Jones|accessdate=27 May 2015|work=[[The Sunday Star-Times]]|date=30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing up in the [[Lower Hutt]] [[state housing]] suburb of Avalon, Jones attended [[Naenae College]] (1953-57). He was one of the c200 foundation pupils, and one of the ten who stayed to the sixth form, where he recalled a brilliant history teacher Guy Bliss (most pupils left as soon as they turned 15 to work in factories).&lt;ref&gt; ''New Zealand Listener''; December 23, 2017 page 18: "The Best Advice I ever got" &lt;/ref&gt; Then to [[Victoria University of Wellington]], where he earned a "blue" in [[boxing]] and contributed to a boxing column in the university's newspaper ''[[Salient (magazine)|Salient]]''. He remained a fan of boxing and sometimes commented on TV on big matches.&lt;ref name="Fighting Talk"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kilgallon|first1=Steve|title=Boxing clever with Bob Jones|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/books/9039820/Boxing-clever-with-Bob-Jones|accessdate=27 May 2015|work=[[The Sunday Star-Times]]|date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones earned his wealth through investments in commercial property via his company Robt. Jones Holdings Ltd, and was worth $550 million according to the 2013 [[National Business Review|NBR]] rich list, and $600 million a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jones Sir Robert |url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/sir-robert-jones |publisher=''[[National Business Review]]'' |accessdate=27 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628083013/http://www.nbr.co.nz/sir-robert-jones |archivedate=28 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He formed the short-lived [[libertarianism|libertarian]] [[New Zealand Party]] in 1983, just before [[Robert Muldoon]]'s snap [[New Zealand general election, 1984|1984 election]]. Jones explicitly stated his disgust that the supposedly pro-free-enterprise [[New Zealand National Party]] had implemented socialist policies like price and wage freezes, and a top tax rate of 66%. His party acted as a [[Spoiler effect|spoiler]], helping to deliver the government to the [[New Zealand Labour Party]]. Then the party implemented free market reforms under Finance Minister [[Roger Douglas]] (hence [[Rogernomics]]). When the election was over, Jones disbanded the party, seeing that Labour had implemented many of his policies. He and Muldoon had a legal feud, where Muldoon unsuccessfully sued Jones for defamation. But Jones had great respect for Muldoon in other areas. Jones even chaired the farewell dinner on the occasion of Muldoon's retirement from Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muldoon retirement farewell dinner|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/21292/farewell-dinner|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=27 May 2015|date=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Jones was located by reporters in a helicopter while out fishing in a remote valley in [[Taupo]]. Jones, incensed at the intrusion when the helicopter landed on the adjacent bank, famously punched TVNZ reporter [[Rod Vaughan]] on the nose, with the whole incident recorded on tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sundaystartimes/4317192a6619.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913174542/http://www.stuff.co.nz/sundaystartimes/4317192a6619.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 September 2012|title=Private rights, public screenings|date=1 January 2009|work=[[The Sunday Star-Times]]|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721231401/http://data.filmarchive.org.nz/search/details_film.php?ref_no=F57683&amp;result_no=0 Film Archive - 6:30 News, TVNZ, 9/7/1985]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721231425/http://data.filmarchive.org.nz/search/details_film.php?ref_no=F84895&amp;result_no=1 Film Archive - 6:30 News, TVNZ, 10/7/1985]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/eyewitness-news---bob-jones-punches-reporter-rod-vaughan-1985 NZ On Screen: Eyewitness News - Bob Jones punches reporter Rod Vaughan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816085310/http://www.nzonscreen.com/title/eyewitness-news---bob-jones-punches-reporter-rod-vaughan-1985 |date=16 August 2011 }}, nzonscreen.com; accessed 24 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was convicted of four charges of assault and fined $1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No bad blood for Jones, reporter |first=Haydon |last=Dewes |agency= |newspaper=The Dominion Post |date=15 April 2003 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He attempted to remove the [[Fiji]]an Embassy from one of his properties during the time of the [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|1987 Fijian Coup]] and succeeded two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiji embassy surrenders to Sir Rob|url=http://innz.natlib.govt.nz/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=73234|publisher=[[National Library of New Zealand]]|accessdate=27 May 2015|date=13 December 1989}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, he was removed from an [[Air New Zealand]] flight by security staff for failing to follow crew instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marvelly witnesses Sir Bob Jones escorted off plane|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/rotorua-daily-post/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503438&amp;objectid=11455513|accessdate=24 April 2016|work=[[The Daily Post (New Zealand)|The Daily Post]]|date=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones' company subsequently bought a jet for Jones and other company executives to use for NZ travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sir Bob Jones buys private jet|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/luxury/70864065/sir-bob-jones-buys-private-jet-and-takes-aim-at-infantile-air-nz|website=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 he threatened legal action when a petition objected to a column he wrote saying, instead of [[Waitangi Day]], Māori should bring [[Pākehā]] breakfast in bed and weed their gardens out of gratitude for existing. He claimed it was just satirical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/350211/sir-bob-jones-threatens-to-sue-woman-who-started-petition|title=Sir Bob Jones threatens to sue woman who started petition|date=2018-02-12|work=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en-nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1372">'''Coin''' ({{IPA|[koˈiŋ]}}, after the [[venetian language|venetian]] for [[Kohen|''cohen'']]) is an Italian upmarket [[department store]] chain dedicated to the worlds of apparel, home decorations, accessories and beauty. Its headquarters are located in [[Venice|Venezia Mestre]].

The '''''Cotton Plantation Record and Account Book''''' is a best-selling and pioneering guide to farm accounting in the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] [[cotton]]-producing regions of the [[United States]]. It was first published in 1847 or 1848 by [[Thomas Affleck (planter)|Thomas Affleck]] (1812-1868), a Scottish immigrant and owner of the [[Glenblythe Plantation]] in [[Gay Hill, Washington County, Texas|Gay Hill]], [[Washington County, Texas|Washington County]], [[Texas]]. The book contains a detailed system, including blank tables to be filled in, that allowed [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] owners to track the efficiency of their production. It also includes essays on various aspects of plantation management, such as the proper care and discipline of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]].

==History and influence==
Thomas Affleck published the first edition of the ''Cotton Plantation Record and Account Book'' in 1847&lt;ref name=dark/&gt; or 1848.&lt;ref name=remlap&gt;{{cite book|author=L. T. Remlap|title=Select Readings for Public and Private Entertainment ...: Accompanied by Explanatory Notes, Together with Appropriate Elocutionary Instructions ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r6JfmC-9ThYC&amp;pg=PA531|year=1886|publisher=R.D.S. Tyler &amp; Company|page=531}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1842 he established a plant nursery and experimental cotton farm near [[Washington, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=quarter/&gt; Later, discussing the origin of his Account Book, Affleck wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
During my first year's planting, I prepared two books with the pen, almost identical to that now published for the cotton plantation, and gave one to each of my next year's overseers, making it a part of my contract with them, that these books were to be correctly kept and returned to me at the end of the year. And, with a little assistance and encouragement, it was done. And what a satisfaction it was to me! Soon after that, at the suggestion of a New Orleans Publisher, I prepared him a transcript of the plan for publication.&lt;ref name=quarter/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Affleck published new editions every year thereafter until the [[American Civil War]] of 1861-1865.&lt;ref name=dark&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Johnson|title=River of Dark Dreams|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0MgHP0OYvaYC&amp;pg=PT281|date=26 February 2013|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-07490-3|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, the name of the book was changed to ''The Farmers' Record and Account Book'' and the scope widened to include "any system of husbandry, ... the products of any climate, and ... farms of any extent."&lt;ref name=remlap/&gt;  Affleck's book was a consistent [[Antebellum South|antebellum]] bestseller&lt;ref name=dark/&gt; in the cotton-producing states&lt;ref name=mind&gt;{{cite book|author1=Elizabeth Fox-Genovese|author2=Eugene D.

Historian [[Mark M. Smith]] has noted that "it was precisely on plantations that masters employed the most rigorous, capitalist management techniques," which created a need for specialized ledgers and accounting techniques, Affleck's being "one of the most popular [of these] record book brands."&lt;ref name=disturbing&gt;{{cite book|author=Melanie Benson Taylor|title=Disturbing Calculations: The Economics of Identity in Postcolonial Southern Literature, 1912&amp;ndash;2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Er5UNgErB-IC&amp;pg=PA61|year=2008|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-3672-5|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1850s, his Account Book had sold over three thousand copies, contributing to his powerful influence on the direction of the "plantation economy into scientific and systematic channels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Agricultural History|volume=15|number=4|date=October 1941|author=Wendell H. Stephenson|title=Ante-Bellum New Orleans as an Agricultural Focus|pages=161–74|jstor=3739}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Robert Williams, Affleck's manual included "a number of other forms which marked an improvement in the system of rural book-keeping. The record forms were essentially consistent with the intent and purpose of modern cost-accounting, and followed the best and most advanced principles of efficient administrative management."&lt;ref name=missionary/&gt;

==Contents==
The book contained a detailed system which allowed plantation owners to record and track the accounts of their plantations, including pounds of cotton produced per slave, per acre, per bale of [[cotton]], and the [[gross (economics)|gross]] and [[net (economics)|net]] value of production.&lt;ref name=dark/&gt; Space was also provided for recording births and deaths of slaves, their clothing and tools, and other such assets and debits.&lt;ref name=quarter/&gt; Unlike many contemporary systems of agricultural book-keeping, Affleck's book took account of [[depreciation]], the costs of labor, and other "often neglected factors."&lt;ref name=missionary&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thomas Affleck: Missionary to the Planter, the Farmer, and the Gardener|author=Robert W. Williams|pages=40–48|journal=Agricultural History|volume=31|number=3|date=July 1957|jstor=3740657}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Walter Johnson (historian)|Walter Johnson]], the book "provided a convenient table by which slaves' annual increase in value could be tracked in the same set of tables as their daily cotton production, and a page at the back where the planter could fill in the value of his slave force, and calculate "interest on the same at ten percent.""&lt;ref name=soul&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Johnson|title=Soul by Soul|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=341eqbt0x5oC&amp;pg=PA26|year=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-00539-6|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was published in four numbers for plantations with fewer than 40, 80, 120,&lt;ref name=cloud&gt;{{cite book|author=N. B.

Affleck's book also contained essays and advice on slave management, including, e.g., [[George Washington]]'s instructions to his own slave overseer&lt;ref name=mind/&gt; and instructions for managing the health of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mitchell F.

===''The Duties of an Overseer''===
The Account Book included Affleck's essay, ''The Duties of an Overseer'', which noted that one of the most important aspects "of a fine crop is an increase in the number and a marked increase in the condition and value of the [[Black people|negroes]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Antebellum Planters and Vormärz Junkers in Comparative Perspective|author=Shearer Davis Bowman|pages=779–808|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=85|number=4|date=October 1980|jstor=1868872|doi=10.2307/1868872}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Slaveowners, for various reasons, were willing or eager to allow their slaves to attend religious services&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;{{cite book|author=Eugene D.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
You will find that an hour devoted every Sabbath morning to their moral and religious instruction would prove a great aid to you in bringing about a better state of things amongst the Negroes. It has been thoroughly tried, and with the most satisfactory results, in many parts of the South. As a matter of mere interest it has proved to be advisable, to say nothing of it as a point of duty. The effect upon their general good behavior, their cleanliness, and good conduct on the Sabbath is such as alone to recommend it to the Planter and Overseer.&lt;ref name=jordan/&gt;

{{Insolvency}}
A '''cram down''' or '''cramdown''' is the involuntary imposition by a court of a reorganization plan over the objection of some classes of creditors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/invest/glossary/bfglosc.htm#cramdown Definition at Bloomberg Financial Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home mortgage loans==

While typically used in a corporate context, the phrase has gained popularity in the context of personal bankruptcies as a result of the [[financial crisis of 2007-2009]].{{cn|date=June 2018}} 

Under current [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] law, bankruptcy courts are not allowed to perform cramdowns (i.e., reduce the principal amount or change the [[interest rate]] or other terms) on creditors who hold loans secured by [[mortgage loan|mortgage]]s on debtors' primary residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|11|1123|b|5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USCSub|11|1322|b|2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

U.S. bankruptcy law provides for an automatic stay of any legal process against debtors or their assets (except perhaps legal process involving criminal law or family law) while bankruptcy is pending, but because U.S. bankruptcy courts cannot cram down loans secured by primary residences, creditors are able to file motions for relief from the stay.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4728933057984532667 Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank]'', 42 F.3d 26 (1st Cir. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  Once relief is granted, creditors may proceed with [[foreclosure]] ''immediately'' while debtors' other financial obligations await restructuring by the bankruptcy court.  Debtors may eventually obtain discharges of their other debts, but by then, they may already have lost their homes.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

===Historical context===

The prohibition on cramdowns on loans secured by primary residences was the result of a political compromise during the process of enacting the [[Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978]].  At the time, Congress was confronted with brutal [[stagflation]] in which economic stagnation was combined with sky-high inflation and interest rates, which were severely frustrating the United States' long-term federal public policy of promoting homeownership (which goes back to the [[National Housing Act of 1934]]).  Congress therefore decided to shield lenders on loans secured by primary residences from cramdowns because there was evidence that they perform "a valuable social service" through their loans.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2581289418078603137 In re Seidel]'', 752 F.2d 1382, 1386 (9th Cir. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;  

Generally, under [[risk-based pricing]], a rational lender will underwrite a loan with an interest rate that correlates directly to the borrower's [[credit risk]].  That is the risk that the lender cannot recover its entire expected [[return on investment]], which in turn includes not only the [[probability of default]], but also any external forces (like a bankruptcy court) that could delay repayment or force the lender to write off any part of the loan.  The higher the risk, the higher the interest rate.  Thus, Congress reasoned, if lenders knew their loans were protected from cramdowns, then they would offer loans at lower interest rates, which in turn would mean lower monthly payments, and thereby enable more Americans to afford homes.  In plain English, Congress sacrificed the interests of the minority of borrower-homeowners who default on their loans for the sake of lowering the cost of homeownership for the majority of borrower-homeowners who successfully repay their loans.  

This rule was fiercely litigated in the 1980s, but the prohibitions on cramdowns on primary residences in both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings were eventually upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;''Nobelman v. Am. Sav. Bank'', 508 U.S. 324, 326 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dewsnup v. Timm'', 502 U.S. 410, 418-419 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;  Finding no relief in Chapters 7 or 13, some individual borrowers tried the creative move of filing under Chapter 11 (which is normally used by corporations).  As a result, the home lending industry went back to Congress, which responded by extending the cramdown restriction for loans secured by primary residences to Chapter 11 with the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13473762298834860380 In re Weinstein]'', 227 B.R. 284, 290 n.4 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary issues===

As a potential solution to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], legislators and consumer advocates have advanced a proposal to allow cram downs on these loans, and legislation to that effect was introduced for potential inclusion in the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Siegel Bernard|first = Tara|title = A Bill Encouraging to Distressed Homeowners, but Its Reach Is Unclear|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|date = September 28, 2008|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/business/yourmoney/29consumer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the financial industry strongly voiced opposition to such a measure, claiming that it would create additional uncertainty as to the value of mortgage loans (and by extension, the [[collateralized debt obligation]]s into which they are bundled).  In addition, like in the late 1970s, the financial industry had powerful political leverage on its side: the risk that revoking the cramdown restriction would result in higher interest rates on home loans.  It was impossible to simultaneously enact a law preventing the industry from jacking up interest rates on all home loans; that would have raised the possibility of [[bank run]]s, because few investors would keep their money at an institution that is legally prohibited from setting interest rates on its loans to accurately reflect the underlying credit risk.  To prevent bank runs, Congress could have simultaneously imposed capital transfer restrictions, but that would have paralyzed the global economy.  As few politicians wanted to be blamed by Wall Street for making homes unaffordable or causing even more bank failures or a second Great Depression, the proposals for revoking the prevention of cramdowns on loans secured by primary residences never found much traction in Congress.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Early use of term==

The term "cram down" in the reorganization context appears in case law as early as 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/1944322143F2d179_1260/NEW%20ENGLAND%20COAL%20&amp;%20COKE%20CO.%20v.%20RUTLAND%20R.%20CO. New Eng. Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. Rutland R. Co.], 143 F.2d 179 (1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informal use==

The term (sometimes used in the phrase '''cram-down deal''') has also gained currency to denote informally any transaction where existing investors ([[debt]] or [[Stock|equity]]) are forced by circumstance to accept an unappealing transaction, such as an expensive financing, a debt transaction that subordinates them, a dilutive equity raising, or an acquisition at an unappealingly low price.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/invest/glossary/bfglosc.htm#cram-down%20deal Definition at Bloomberg Financial Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Stracher|first = Cameron|title = The Year in Ideas: A to Z; The Cram-Down|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|date = December 9, 2001|url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E4DF143CF93AA35751C1A9679C8B63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4897">'''De-Mail''' is a [[Germany|German]] [[E-Government]] communications service that makes it possible to exchange [[legal document|legal]] [[electronic document]]s between citizens, agencies, and businesses over the Internet. The project called Bürgerportal is realized by the German government in cooperation with private business partners in an effort to reduce communication costs of administration and companies.

The project was announced in 2008 and has been accepted by [[Bundestag]] and [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] in early 2011. The De-Mail law (which serves as the legal basis for the service) went into effect on May 2, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Gesetzestexte/de_mail_gesetz.pdf?__blob=publicationFile Federal Ministry of the Interior]: De-Mail Law, May 2nd 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
With the introduction of De-Mail the German legislation implements the [[European Union|EU]] [[Directive on services in the internal market]] which demands that authorities accept [[legally binding]] electronic communications by the end of 2009.

The government specifies legal and technical requirements for the services, but does not provide the services. The services are provided by private companies which are allowed to provide De-Mail services after an official [[certification]] process.

== Services ==
Besides email communication, other services are specified that support the communication process.

* '''De-Mail''' is the email communication service which also specifies several ''options'' commonly known from postal mail, such as [[registered mail]], personal delivery (delivery only to the recipient, not to any representatives), delivery and pick-up notifications.
* '''De-Mail accounts''' can be registered by individuals and companies and require identification of the applicant. Email addresses for individuals have the form &lt;Firstname&gt;.&lt;Lastname&gt;@&lt;De-Mail-Provider&gt;.de-mail.de (but can also be registered for pseudonyms if marked as such); companies can also register subdomains in the form of &lt;Domain-Name&gt;.de-mail.de.
* '''De-Ident''' allows users to request signed [[Identity document|proof of identity]] from their provider (based on the identification during the account sign-up process) which can then be forwarded via De-Mail to e.g. online shops to provide proof of identity, age, etc.
* '''De-Safe''' provides users with encrypted online storage for documents. Usage of this service does, however, not fulfill the legal storage and archiving requirements for documents.

== Usage ==
Usage should be voluntary for all users, and should only be an additional option to postal mail.

== Criticism ==
Several aspects of the law have sparked criticism of the system.

* Communication between De-Mail and regular email addresses is not possible. The same applies to clients using the ''electronic court and administration mail'' ([[:de:Elektronisches Gerichts- und Verwaltungspostfach|Elektronisches Gerichts- und Verwaltungspostfach]]) which already provides legal electronic communication between courts and other participating governmental organizations.
* [[End-to-end encryption]] can be offered by the providers but is not mandatory. This would make it possible for providers to read emails before transmission and can constitute a possible point of attack. However, users can still apply encryption before sending De-Mail messages.
* The data provided during the identication process for the account creation is centrally stored and available to the authorities. The De-Mail law even specifies naming the account owner to private individuals.
* Official notifications are delivered once they are available in the recipient's mailbox. This is contrary to the postal mail, where a letter is only seen as legally delivered after it has been accepted by the recipient.

== Current providers ==
The following companies are currently accredited as De-Mail providers
* [[Deutsche Telekom AG]]
* [[Mentana-Claimsoft]]
* [[T-Systems]]
* [[United Internet AG]] (brands [[GMX Mail|GMX]], [[1&amp;1 Internet|1&amp;1]], [[Web.de]])
In the process of accreditation are:
* [[Deutsche Post]]

'''Deputy Commissioner''' (popularly abbreviated to "DC") or [[District Magistrate (Bangladesh)|District Magistrate]] is a chief administrative and revenue officer of a [[Districts of Bangladesh|district]] or an administrative sub-unit of a [[Divisions of Bangladesh|division]]. According to the [[Code of Criminal Procedure (Bangladesh)|Code of Criminal Procedure of Bangladesh]], the Government shall appoint as many persons as it thinks fit to be Executive Magistrates and shall appoint one of them to be the District Magistrate.&lt;ref name="EM"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/print_sections.php?id=75%20Accessed&amp;vol=&amp;sections_id=14300|title=The Code of Criminal Procedure - Executive Magistrate|website=bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term District Magistrate is used in the Criminal procedure code to denote the principal executive magistrate of the district. However, after 1960, the district magistrate term came to be redesignated throughout the country as Deputy Commissioner or DC. During the early year, before Bangladesh era, the deputy commissioner's office used to be concerned with internal security and revenue administration. Over the time, however, the office has become increasingly occupied with the general welfare of the people in the district. The Deputy Commissioner is a representative of the Government in the field of law and order, land administration, disaster management and general and local elections. The deputy commissioner works under the general guidance and supervision of the Divisional Commissioner. They are under the administrative control of the Cabinet Division although their posting and transfer are made by the [[Ministry of Public Administration]]. The deputy commissioners are drawn from the members of the [[Bangladesh Civil Service]] (Administration).&lt;ref name="DC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Deputy_Commissioner|title=District Commissioner - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downtown Compton''' is the major business district of [[Compton, California]]. Downtown Compton started out as a thriving and safe environment throughout the early 1950s to the mid-1970s. When gang violence and robberies sparked in the 70s businesses began to move out and relocate leaving Downtown Compton a [[ghost town]]. It is now home to many businesses, two shopping centers, and the [[Martin Luther King Jr. Transit Center]]. The [[Metro Blue Line (LACMTA)]] now currently runs through 'Downtown Compton making travel to the city much easier.

== History ==

=== 1950s-1970s ===
Throughout the 1950s to early 1970s Downtown Compton was a major business district and home to many companies. During weekends streets would be packed and filled with shoppers, especially during the holidays.

=== 1970s-1980s ===
During the late '70s the face of Downtown Compton began to take a drastic turn. Robberies and ongoing gang violence due to the primarily African-American street gangs the [[Crips]] and the [[Bloods]], businesses began to move elsewhere to avoid further problems.

=== 1980s-1990s ===
During the late 80s the face of [[Compton, California|Compton]] began to change with new mayor, [[Omar Bradley]], This included the construction of the new [[Compton Town Center]]. Around this time the [[Metro Rail (Los Angeles County)|Los Angeles County Metro Rail System]] began adding the finishing touches to the [[Metro Blue Line (LACMTA)|Metro Blue Line]] that runs straight through Downtown Compton on the median of [[Willowbrook Avenue]]. This led to the construction of the new [[Martin Luther King Jr. Transit Center]], also located on '''Willowbrook''' along with the [[Compton (LACMTA station)|Metro Blue Line Compton Station]].

== Recent Years ==
Downtown Compton is now home to the following businesses.

*[[Martin Luther King Jr, Transit Center]]
*[[Compton Town Center]]
*Renaissance Plaza

The '''Dulles Technology Corridor''' is a [[business cluster]] containing many [[Defense contractor|defense]] and technology companies, located in [[Northern Virginia]] near [[Washington Dulles International Airport]].  The area was called "The Silicon Valley of the East" by ''[[Atlantic (magazine)|Atlantic]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/06/the-silicon-valley-of-the-east-is-washington-dc/240055/ | title='The Silicon Valley of the East' Is Washington, D.C. | author=Derek Thompson | work=The Atlantic | date=June 7, 2011 | accessdate=December 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was dubbed the "'''Netplex'''" in a 1993 article by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine. Another article in 2000 claimed that the area contained "vital electronic pathways that carry more than half of all traffic on the Internet. The region is home to more telecom and satellite companies than any other place on earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Donnelly |first= Sally B. |last2= Zagorin |first2= Adam |date= August 14, 2000 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,997688-1,00.html |title= D.C.

'''Edward Boches''' is an [[United States|American]] professor at [[Boston University]]’s [[Boston_University_College_of_Communication|College of Communication]] where he has taught advertising and creative courses since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/com/about-com/faculty/edward-boches/ Boston University College of Communication Faculty]&lt;/ref&gt; Previously he was a partner, chief innovation officer,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/business/media/22addes.html New York Times, News from the Advertising Industry]&lt;/ref&gt; chief creative officer and executive creative director at the ad agency Mullen, where he worked for 31 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/mullen-ups-boches-executive-cd-21884 AdWeek ''Mullen Ups Boches to ECD'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/new-roles-wenneker-boches-mullen-103840 AdWeek ''New Roles for Wenneker, Boches'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ooXXuFMQrBcC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=edward+boches+named+chief+innovation+officer+mullen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nBpWw5YJZ_&amp;sig=a0pM0AVkTFl5z6vD-CgZvtUFNC4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HGmlVN6vIIHZggSB3YLIDQ&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=edward%20boches%20named%20chief%20innovation%20officer%20mullen&amp;f=false ''Advertisers at Work'' by Tracy Tuten]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Boches joined Mullen in 1983 as a vice president/account director and director of public relations. He launched the agency's PR practice and shortly afterward joined the creative department. During his tenure at the agency he created campaigns for brands that included General Motors, Panera Bread, Lending Tree, Smartfood Popcorn, LL Bean, and Monster.com, including the job board's ''When I Grow Up'' Super Bowl commercial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adage.com/article/news/monster-show/58137/ Ad Age: ''Monster.com Best of Show]''&lt;/ref&gt; His campaigns were recognized by international, national and regional creative awards including Cannes, the One Show, New York Art Directors, the Clio Awards and Hatch, where he won Best of Show in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.highbeam.com/2935/article-1P2-8194513/rising-stars-boston-ad-wars Boston Globe: ''Rising Stars in Boston Ad Wars'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 he was named print copywriter of the year by AdWeek.

He was an early industry advocate for the use of Twitter and social media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commarts.com/columns/world-has-changed Communication Arts: ''The World has Changed'']&lt;/ref&gt;  encouraging the use of new platforms long before they were popular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/what-can-twitter-do-you-98866 AdWeek: ''What Twitter Can Do for You'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he created "Brand Bowl",&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9kn87w8-zRsC&amp;pg=PT114&amp;dq=edward+boches&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xAamVMHRDMLXgwSMjITADg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=edward%20boches&amp;f=false David Meerman Scott: ''The New Rules of Marketing and PR'']&lt;/ref&gt; which used Twitter to monitor and measure reaction to Super Bowl advertising.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/07/business/media/for-super-bowl-ads-no-standout-performer.html?_r=0 New York Times ''For Super Bowl Ads, No Standout Performer'']&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal defenses}}

In [[jurisprudence]], an '''excuse''' is a [[defense (legal)|defense]] to [[crime|criminal]] charges that is distinct from an ''exculpation''. [[Justification (jurisprudence)|Justification]] and excuse are different defenses in a criminal case (See [[Justification and excuse]]).&lt;ref name=CL&gt;Criminal Law Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder&lt;/ref&gt; Exculpation is a related concept which reduces or extinguishes a person's [[culpability]] and therefore a person's liability to pay compensation to the victim of a [[tort]] in the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]].

The "excuse" provides a [[mitigating factor]] for a group of persons sharing a common characteristic. Justification, as in [[justifiable homicide]], vindicates or shows the [[justice]]. Thus, [[society]] approves of the purpose or motives underpinning some actions or the consequences flowing from them (see Robinson{{clarify|date=August 2017}}), and distinguishes those where the behavior cannot be approved but some excuse may be found in the characteristics of the defendant, e.g. that the accused was a serving police officer or suffering from a [[mental illness]]. Thus, a justification describes the quality of the act, whereas an excuse relates to the [[status (law)|status]] or [[capacity (law)|capacity]] (or lack of it) in the accused. These factors can affect the resulting [[Legal judgment|judgment]] which may be an [[acquittal]], or in the case of a conviction may mitigate [[sentence (law)|sentencing]].   An excuse may also be something that a person or persons use to explain any criticism or comments based on the outcome of any specific event.

==Explanation==
The [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[legislative]] branches of modern [[State (polity)|states]] enact policy into laws which are then administered through the judicial system. [[Judge]]s also have a residual discretion to excuse individuals from [[Legal liability|liability]] if it represents a [[justice|just]] result. When considering the consequences which are to be imposed on those involved in the activities forming the subject matter of the [[common law]] or [[legislation]], [[government]]s and judges have a choice:
:the criminal or civil [[defendant]] may be excused from liability as belonging to a class of person that ought to be excused, their behaviour may be considered justified, or an exculpation may be allowed on the merits of the particular case.
To be ''excused'' from liability means that although the defendant may have been a participant in the sequence of events leading to the prohibited outcome, no liability will attach to the particular defendant because they belong to a class of person exempted from liability. In some cases, this will be a policy of expediency. Hence, members of the [[armed forces]], the [[police]] or other civil organizations may be granted a degree of immunity for causing prohibited outcomes while acting in the course of their official duties, e.g. for an [[assault]] or trespass to the person caused during a lawful [[arrest]] or for an ambulance driver exceeding the speed limit in an emergency. Others are excused by virtue of their status and capacity. Others may escape liability because the quality of their actions satisfied a general public [[goodness and value theory|good]]. For example, the willingness to [[self-defense (theory)|defend]] oneself and others, or [[defense of property|property]] from injury may benefit [[society]] at large. Albeit that the actions of a [[vigilante]] fall outside the formal controls that would seek to ensure reasonable use of force in state-appointed police officers, such people may accidentally find themselves interrupting the commission of a crime and their actions in defence of their own or another's interests is justified out of expediency as opposed to having to wait until a police officer arrives before help can be rendered.  Whilst the jurisprudential importance of the distinction between justification and excuse defenses is clear, legally they have the same effect, acquittal, and there is an ongoing debate about whether the distinction makes any practical difference.

An ''exculpation'' is a [[defense (legal)|defense]] in which a [[defendant]] argues that despite the fact they committed and are guilty of the [[crime]], [[tort]], or other wrong and have a liability to compensate the victim, they should be exculpated because of special circumstances that operated in favor of the defendant at the time they broke the [[law]].

===Defenses===
*[[Defense of infancy]]
:This is an aspect of the [[public policy (law)|public policy]] of ''[[parens patriae]]''. In the criminal law, each state will consider the nature of its own [[society]] and the available evidence of the age at which antisocial behavior begins to manifest itself. Some societies will have qualities of indulgence toward the young and inexperienced and will not wish them to be exposed to the criminal law system before all other avenues of response have been exhausted. Hence, some states have a policy of ''[[doli incapax]]'' and exclude liability for all acts and omissions that would otherwise have been criminal up to a specified age. Thereafter, there may be a [[rebuttable presumption]] against the use of criminal sanctions except in more serious cases. Other states leave discretion to [[prosecutor]]s to argue or the judges to rule on whether the child understood that what was being done was wrong.
:The status of [[minor (law)|minor]] may also excuse liability in the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] for [[contract]], [[tort]] and other legal situations during which liabilities would otherwise attach to the infant. Where there is only minimal understanding, transactions entered into will be void, i.e. the infant is excused. When understanding grows in line with age, the law switches from excuse to exculpation, and transactions may be voidable, i.e. the courts will judge, whether in the particular circumstances, it would be right to favor the interests of the child or the interests of the other party or parties involved in the transaction. Hence, it would not be appropriate to allow a child knowingly to deceive innocent retailers or service providers into supplying value, and then allow him or her to avoid liability to pay a reasonable sum of money for those goods or services. This is a balancing of political and commercial interests.
*[[Insanity defense]], [[Mental Disorder (Insanity) Defense|mental disorder defence]]s and the [[M'Naghten Rules]]
:If individuals are a danger to society and/or to themselves but not responsible through a lack of understanding, there is no point in [[punishment]] (whether in the criminal or non-criminal sense). Punishment is only justified [[morality|morally]] if the person understands that what was done was wrong and accepts the judgment of society as part of the process of [[expiation]] and [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]]. Hence, as with ''parens patriae'', the state accepts the person as being in need of care, and offers or requires medical treatment instead of subjecting such people to the stress of having to undergo a trial as to liability.
*[[Settled insanity]] is defined as a permanent or "settled" condition caused by long-term [[substance abuse]] and differs from the temporary state of [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]]. In some [[United States]] jurisdictions "settled insanity" can be used as a basis for an [[insanity defense]], even though voluntary intoxication can not, if the "settled insanity"  negates one of the required elements of the crime  such as [[mens rea]].
*[[Automatism (law)|Automatism]]
:This criminal defense straddles the divide between excuse and exculpation. It works by showing that the defendant's mind was not in control of the body's movements at the relevant time and that this loss of control was not foreseeable. For example, a [[diabetes|diabetic]] suffering a [[hypoglycaemia|hypoglycaemic]] attack will not be liable for any loss or damage caused. To that extent, it borrows from the policy excuse favoring those who are suffering from a mental illness, but allows the full trial as to liability to proceed. For a detailed comparative law discussion, see [[automatism (case law)]]
*Self-defense is, in general, some reasonable action taken in protection of self.  An act taken in self-defense often is not a crime at all; no punishment will be imposed.  To qualify, any defensive force must be proportionate to the threat.  Use of a firearm in response to a non-lethal threat is a typical example of disproportionate force; however, such decisions are dependent on the situation and the applicable law, and thus the example situation can in some circumstances be defensible, Generally because of a codified presumption intended to prevent the unjust negation of this defense by the trier of fact.

===Exculpations===
*[[Duress]] in criminal law and in [[duress (contract law)|contract]] law
:In this situation, the defendant has actually done everything to break the law and intended to do it to avoid some threatened or actual harm. Thus, some degree of liability already attaches to the defendant for what was done. In law, the usual rule is that the defendant's motive for breaking the law is irrelevant although, in the criminal law, this may reduce the sentence. The basis of the defense argues that the threats made by the other person make the defendant's entire behavior involuntary and therefore the liability should be reduced or removed. The extent to which this defense should be allowed, if at all, is a simple matter of public policy. A state may say that no threat should force a person deliberately to break the law, particularly if this breach will cause loss or damage to a third person. Alternatively, a state may take the view that even though people may have ordinary levels of courage, they may nevertheless be coerced into agreeing to break the law and this human weakness should have some recognition in the law. For example, suppose that a group of terrorists kidnap A's family and instruct A to carry a large bomb into a crowded area as the price for the release of his family. If A carries out these instructions, making no effort to contact the police or to warn those in the danger area, the issue of liability for death and injury resulting depends on the state's values. This is a legal as well as a political decision. In the civil law, duress is similarly only an exculpation, rendering contracts and other transactions voidable, and offering only minor mitigation in the calculation of the amount of any [[damages]] payable.
*[[Mistake (criminal law)|Mistake of fact]] in criminal law and in [[mistake (contract law)|mistake in contract law]]
:The fundamental policy operating here is ''[[ignorantia juris non excusat]]'', i.e. the state cannot allow ignorance of the law to be a defense. This would unduly encourage the lazy and the deceitful to trade on their ignorance (real or otherwise). Thus, only mistakes relating to the factual basis of what is being attempted can form this defense and, in the majority of situations, it will only offer limited benefit to a defendant of ordinary capacity since the state owes no general duty to save citizens from the effects of their own ignorance or stupidity. Nevertheless, there may be limited circumstances in which people may honestly believe things that either prevent them from forming the requisite ''[[mens rea]]'' or from reaching an ''[[ad idem]]'' agreement.
*[[Provocation (legal)|Provocation]]
:This is an example of a purely mitigatory defense in that, in the few situations when it is allowed to operate, it only reduces the level of criminal liability. In most legal systems, it cannot extinguish liability. It is a natural part of human nature that people get angry when they are provoked. But the state has a positive interest in maintaining good order and therefore, no matter what is done or said, people are not supposed to react violently or to cause loss or damage. Even though certain forms of physical contact or particular words might cause even reasonable people to become seriously annoyed, the state cannot sanction or justify retaliation. Thus, in most aspects of the law, any loss of control is taken to be an aggravating factor that, in the criminal law or the law of intentional torts, might well lead to an increase in sentencing, or the award of punitive or exemplary damages.

The ''FATF blacklist''  was the common shorthand description for the [[Financial Action Task Force]] list of "Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories" (NCCTs). &lt;ref name=Introduction-May1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/about/ | title=About FATF| accessdate=1 May 2018| publisher=FATF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''FATF blacklist''' or OECD blacklist has been issued by the [[Financial Action Task Force]] since 2000 and lists countries  which it judges to be non-cooperative in the global fight against [[money laundering]] and [[Terrorism financing|terrorist financing]], calling them "Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories" (NCCTs).&lt;ref name = fatfworks&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/about/whatwedo/ | title= FATF Works| accessdate=1 May 2018| publisher=FATF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although non-appearance on the blacklist was perceived to be a mark of approbation for [[offshore financial centre]]s (or "tax havens") who are sufficiently well regulated to meet all of the FATF's criteria, in practice the list included countries that did not operate as offshore financial centres.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The FATF updates the blacklist regularly, adding or deleting entries. &lt;ref name = fatfworks/&gt;

==History==
FATF was established by the G-7 Summit that was held in Paris in 1989. Founding stakeholders include the G-7 Heads of State or Government, President of the European Commission and eight other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/about/historyofthefatf/| title=History of FATF|accessdate= 1 May 2018| publisher=FATF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "non-cooperative" was criticized by some analysts as misleading, as a number of countries on the list simply lacked the infrastructure or resources to cope with relatively sophisticated financial criminals who tried to operate there. Since 2008 the FATF has, at the behest of [[G20]] leaders, installed a more analytical process of identifying jurisdictions deficient in their anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regimes. &lt;ref name = fatfworks/&gt;
==Primary Works==
One of the main objectives of the FATF is to establish norms and standards of “legal, regulatory and operational measures” to fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the security and integrity of the international financial system. However, FATF “has no investigative authority.” FATF works with nation-states to bring legislative changes and regulatory reforms in aforementioned sectors.&lt;ref name = fatfworks/&gt;  In addition, FAFT also provides policy recommendations that meet international standards to countries for combating “money laundering and the financing of terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. FATF has been providing policy recommendations since 1990 and their recommendations have revised four times since then. FATF also monitors the situations of its members in establishing adequate measures and institutions to fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. FATF also makes sure that it is aware of national-level vulnerabilities of its member states “with the aim of protecting the international financial system from misuse.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/internationalstandardsoncombatingmoneylaunderingandthefinancingofterrorismproliferation-thefatfrecommendations.html| title= Policy Recommendations|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member States==
According to its official website, there are 37 member of FATF, representing most financial centres around the world. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FATF Members|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/about/membersandobservers/|publisher=FATF|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==June 2000 report==
The initial list of fifteen countries regarded as uncooperative in the fight against money laundering, was published in June 2000.&lt;ref name=list2000&gt;[http://www.fatf-gafi.org/topics/high-riskandnon-cooperativejurisdictions/documents/fatfpublicstatement22february2013.html FATF Public Statement 22 February 2013: High-risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions]&lt;/ref&gt; The list met criticism from professionals experienced in the offshore financial sector. The designation of the Cayman Islands as non-cooperative was thought to be harsh,&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Hetherington-Gore (n.d.), [http://www.lowtax.net/lowtax/html/jcaspec.html The Cayman Islands – Paradise Regained?] lowtaxnet.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2016}} particularly as the 2000 report itself acknowledged that "the Cayman Islands has been a leader in developing anti-money laundering programmes throughout the Caribbean region. It has served as president of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force, and it has provided substantial assistance to neighbouring states in the region. It has demonstrated cooperation on criminal law enforcement matters, and uncovered several serious cases of fraud and money laundering otherwise unknown to authorities in FATF member states."{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==February 2017 Statement==
Regarding with North Korea, the FATF released the following concern: 

“The FATF remains concerned by the DPRK’s failure to address the significant deficiencies in its anti‑money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime and the serious threat this poses to the integrity of the international financial system. The FATF urges the DPRK to immediately and meaningfully address its AML/CFT deficiencies. Further, FATF has serious concerns with the threat posed by DPRK’s illicit activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and its financing.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TATF Public Statement 2017|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/high-riskandnon-cooperativejurisdictions/documents/public-statement-february-2017.html|publisher=FATF|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although its main focus is on tax crime, the OECD is also concerned with money laundering and has complemented the work carried out by the FATF.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120908203717/http://www.oecd.org/document/39/0,3343,en_2649_33767_2499879_1_1_1_37427,00.html Tax and crime - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] &lt;/ref&gt;

The OECD has maintained a 'blacklist' of countries it considers "uncooperative tax havens" in the drive for transparency of tax affairs and the effective exchange of information, officially called "The List of Uncooperative Tax Havens". Since May 2009, no countries were officially listed as uncooperative tax havens in the light of their commitments to implement the OECD standards.&lt;ref name=oecd2009&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/countries/monaco/listofunco-operativetaxhavens.htm List of Unco-operative Tax Havens] Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] n.d., retrieved 7 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 October 2008, at an OECD meeting in Paris, 17 countries led by France and Germany decided to draw up a new blacklist of tax havens. It had been asked to investigate around 40 new tax havens where undeclared revenue was hidden and which hosted many of the non-regulated hedge funds that came under fire during the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. Germany, France, and other countries called on the OECD to add Switzerland to a blacklist of countries which encourage tax fraud.&lt;ref name=glfo&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/2008/10/21/calls-from-17-countries-for-new-tax-haven-blacklist/ Calls from 17 countries for new tax haven blacklist] euronews, world news, 21 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 April 2009, the OECD published a list of countries, divided into three parts depending on whether they implemented an "internationally agreed tax standard", in select jurisdictions – [[tax haven]]s or other financial centers of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/ctp/42497950.pdf |title=A Progress Report on The Jurisdictions Surveyed by The OECD Global Forum in Implementing The Internationally Agreed Tax Standard |publisher=OECD|format=PDF |date=2 April 2009|page=10|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Digital Media Innovation ===

In the late 80s and early 90s, Brody was head of the [[Expanded Books | Expanded Books Project]] at the [[Voyager Company]] and was involved in the development and creation of their "expanded books", originally designed to be read on the then-new Apple [[PowerBook 100]].&lt;ref name="themagazine"/&gt; The Voyager Company released their first expanded books on [[floppy disk]] for the PowerBook in 1992, and presented them at that year's [[MacWorld Expo]].&lt;ref name="voyagerdebut"&gt;{{cite news|last= Langberg| first= Mike| date= 1992-02-24| title= Firms seek to marry books, computers| url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-02-24/business/1992055074_1_voyager-michael-crichton-wonderland| newspaper= The Baltimore Sun| access-date= 2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books on this original disk were [[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]] by [[Michael Crichton]], [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] by [[Douglas Adams]], and [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]] by [[Lewis Carroll]].&lt;ref name="voyagerdebut"/&gt; Brody's public statements at the time on the Voyager Company's early expanded books, or 'e-books', were that he believed they were more of an experiment than a definitive 'product', paving the way for future versions of [[e-books]] for the next generation of less expensive, more lightweight, and more high-powered portable computers.&lt;ref name="themagazine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="voyagerdebut"/&gt;

=== Digital Evangelism ===

Brody has spent much of his career public speaking about digital media innovation and marketing in both Europe &lt;ref name="Memory"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.mediamatic.net/9079/en/my-home-is-my-memory-is-my-home|title=My Home is my Memory is my Home |accessdate=2015-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Florian Brody, Mario Veitl |publisher=Ars Electronica Archiv |title=ARTificial Intelligence &amp; ARTificial ART in: Digitale Träume Virtuelle Welten, Band 02|url=http://90.146.8.18/de/archives/festival_archive/festival_catalogs/festival_artikel.asp?iProjectID=8961 |access-date=2015-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the US.&lt;ref name="VRMeckler"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/computer-science/virtual-reality/virtual-worlds/faq/conf/Meckler.91.announce |title=Meckler VR Conference Program, 23-25 Sept 91, San Francisco|accessdate=2015-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "SAPradio"/&gt; He has done multiple [[TEDx talks]] in Austria.&lt;ref name="TEDtalkKlagenfurt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TEDtalkVienna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TEDtalkLinz"/&gt;

Tarbuk &amp; Co.]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title="Brettl vor dem Kopf" und andere Texte fürs Kabarett |last=Qualtinger |first=Helmut |author2=Carl Merz |author3=Traugott Krischke  |year=1996 |publisher=Deuticke |isbn=978-3-216-30164-2 |page=356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most important businesses in the motor trade in Austria and CEE until the beginning of the 21st century.

== Family ==
Tarbuk's family was of Austrian and Croatian descent, having been settled as military farmers on the Austrian border with the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans. His father, Johann Tarbuk von Sensenhorst was field marshal in the Austro-Hungarian Army; his mother was Mathilde Josefa Bayrhammer Edle von Sensenhorst.

"Fritz" had 4 brothers: 
*Karl Tarbuk von Sensenhorst (general in the Austrian Army, later field marshal in the German [[Wehrmacht]] 
*Hans Tarbuk von Sensenhorst (Gen.-Colonel in the Austrian Army, later General in the German [[Wehrmacht]])
*Robert Tarbuk von Sensenhorst (Colonel in the German [[Wehrmacht]])
*Felix Tarbuk von Sensenhorst, (Colonel in the German [[Wehrmacht]] and Counter-Intelligence Officer)

The brothers had two sisters.

==Marriage==
"Fritz" Tarbuk von Sensenhorst was married to Maria Librowicz (a native of [[Warsaw]]), the daughter of   Aleksandr Librowicz and Bronisława von Lublinska. &lt;!-- Date of marriage? --&gt; Fritz and Maria had no children.

==Business life==
In 1920 Tarbuk founded the motor trading-house ''F. M. Tarbuk &amp; Co.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Automotive Austria |last=Mosser |first=Alois |author2=Gerhard Bruner |year=2007 |publisher=Fahrzeugindustrie Wirtschaftskammer Österreich |page=186 |url=http://wko.at/fahrzeuge/content_frame/100%20Jahre%20Fahrzeugindustrie/automotive_austria.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting distribution in Austria for the German brands [[DKW]], [[Horch]], [[Audi]] and [[Wanderer (Unternehmen)|Wanderer]] of the German [[Auto Union|Auto Union AG]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mein bewegtes Leben |last=Lohner |first=Christiane |author2=Lea Roth |author3=Michel Kaltschmid  |year=2004 |publisher=Braumüller |isbn=978-3-7003-1465-3 |page=40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Mathis (cars)|Mathis]]. In the 1930s he used his personal contacts with officers, diplomats and politicians to open a sales and workshop network in Austria and [[Slovakia]].

In 1938 his partner ''Peter Pflaum'' joined the business. During World War II the Tarbuk-workshops in Vienna and Bratislava/Pressburg were working for the German [[Wehrmacht]]. During the time of petroleum shortage '''F. M. Tarbuk &amp; Co.''' was the leading business in modifying motorcars to wood-gas burning (using the patented system of [[Georges Imbert]]).

&lt;!-- During the [[Holocaust]] von Tarbuk used his personal connections to leading representatives of politics, sports and the art world (e.g. [[Franz von Papen]], [[Hermann Goering]], [[Hans von Stuck]], [[Willi Forst]], [[Herbert von Karajan]], [[Heinz Ruehmann]] etc.), to protect his Jewish partner, Peter Pflaum, as well as staff-members of his company and other people, e.g. Otto Mendl, the owner of Viennas largest bakery the [[Ankerbrot]] works, hiding in Tarbuk's business from prosecution by the German regime. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} NOTE: The above-referenced text is too important to permit to remain unhidden until definitive proof of its claims is provided. --&gt;

After World War II, Tarbuk &amp; Co. started sales and service networks for [[Aero (automobile)|Aero]], [[Praga]], [[Škoda Auto]], [[Tatra (company)|Tatra]], [[Simca]], [[Talbot]], [[Rootes Group|Rootes]], [[Humber]], [[Hillman]], [[Sunbeam Motor Car Company|Sunbeam]], [[Chrysler Corporation]], [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]], [[Fargo (truck)|Fargo]], [[Dodge]], [[Isuzu]], [[Jensen Motors]], [[Saab Automobile|Saab]], [[Datsun]]/[[Nissan]], [[MG Rover Group]], [[Austin Motor Company]], [[MG Cars|MG]], [[Land Rover]], [[Range Rover]] and [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] in Austria.

From 1950 a group of companies in Austria and her neighboring countries was built up with affiliated companies, workshops and sales outlets for 48 brands of the motor industry: [[Fiat]], [[Lancia]], [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Ford]], [[Volvo]], [[Subaru]], [[Mazda]], [[Suzuki]], [[Opel]], [[Daewoo]], [[Chevrolet]], [[Messerschmidt]]-Fendt, [[Harley Davidson]], [[Vespa]], [[Ducati]], [[Hiab]], [[Atlas Weyhausen]], [[Massey Ferguson]], [[Deutz-Fahr]], [[Fiat]], [[Zetor]], [[J. C. Bamford|JCB]], [[Case Corporation|Case]], [[Kubota Corporation|Kubota]], [[Same Deutz-Fahr|SAME]], [[Mercedes-Benz Trac]] and [[Landini (tractor)|Landini]].

==Death==
Friedrich Maria "Fritz" Tarbuk von Sensenhorst died in 1976, aged 79.

==Posthumous==
After his death the business continued to flourish under the management by Peter Pflaum and Tarbuk's two   nephews. The group of companies was later structured into the shareholding company TARBUK/AG in 1992 under Dr [[Mario Seiller-Tarbuk]]. Until the late 1990s the  Tarbuk Group had 40 affiliated companies with over 1000 employees, and was one of the largest and most successful Austrian businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Von 400 Millionen Euro auf 0 herunter |url=http://auw.form.at/_doks/1096/2418.pdf |format=PDF|work=Auto &amp; Wirtschaft Österreich |date=September 2007 |accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downturn==
Later it was hit by structural changes, the downturn of the motor industry and management mistakes by the end of the 1990s.

In 2003, Erhard F. Grossnigg joined as partner and troubleshooter, but it was possible only to keep a handful of car-dealerships, workshops and parts of the agricultural machine business (Deutz-Fahr Austria, Austro Diesel) open. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

A '''front office application''' is any [[software]] that has a direct relation to customers. It provides functionality and data necessary to take orders, configure complex products and provide effective service and support to customers. It includes [[customer relationship management]] (CRM), [[sales force automation]], [[customer support]] and field service. &lt;ref name="front office application Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=front office application Definition|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/43516/front-office-application|publisher=PCMag|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, a '''back office application''' has no such direct relation. It provides functionality for internal operations such as [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP), [[inventory control]], [[manufacturing]] and all of the supply chain activities associated with procuring goods, services and raw materials. If an ERP system includes order entry and customer service capabilities, that system would bridge both back office and front office.&lt;ref name="back office application Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=back office application Definition|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/38343/back-office-application|publisher=PCMag|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The [[software]] enabling the [[customer]] to order a [[product (business)|product]] from a [[company]] is considered a front office [[Application software|application]]. If a [[salesperson]] is typing the order into the application, it is still considered a front office application even though the [[customer]] is not directly interacting with the [[software]].&lt;ref name="front office application Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=front office application Definition|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/43516/front-office-application|publisher=PCMag|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the [[company]] uses different [[software]] to order the product from a [[manufacturer]], it is considered a back office application.&lt;ref name="back office application Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=back office application Definition|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/38343/back-office-application|publisher=PCMag|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haim Kaufman''' ({{lang-he|חיים קופמן}}, 12 December 1934 – 7 August 1995) was an [[Israel]]i politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Likud]] between 1977 and 1988, and again from 1990 until his death in 1995.

==Biography==
Born in [[Tel Aviv]] during the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate era]], Leket served in the [[Artillery Corps (Israel)|Artillery Corps]] during his [[national service]] in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. He studied law at the School of Law and Economics in Tel Aviv, and later worked as a corporate director.

A member of [[Herut]], Kaufman chaired the party's youth group and the [[Dor Hemsheh]] group within it. He was on the Likud list (an alliance of [[Herut]] and several other right-wing parties) for the [[Israeli legislative election, 1973|1973 elections]], but failed to win a seat. However, he entered the Knesset on 19 January 1977 as a replacement for [[Binyamin Halevi]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mkindexbyknesset_eng.asp?knesset=8 Knesset Members in the Eighth Knesset] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|May 1977 elections]], and again in [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|1981]] and [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984]], serving as Deputy [[Finance Minister of Israel|Minister of Finance]] between 1981 and 1984. He became a member of the Likud secretariat and chairman of its municipal branch, as well as chairing the party's [[Petah Tikva]] branch and editing the party magazine ''BeEretz Yisrael''.

Although he lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1988|1988 elections]], Kaufman returned to the Knesset on 8 October 1990 as a replacement for [[Zalman Shoval]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mkindexbyknesset_eng.asp?knesset=12 Knesset Members in the Twelfth Knesset] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; He retained his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1992|1992 elections]], but died in office on 7 August 1995.

'''Internal communications''' ('''IC''') is the function responsible for effective [[communications]] among participants within an [[organization]]. The scope of the function varies by organization and practitioner, from producing and delivering messages and campaigns on behalf of management, to facilitating two-way dialogue and developing the communication skills of the organization's participants.

Modern understanding of internal communications is a field of its own and draws on the theory and practice of related professions, not least [[journalism]], [[knowledge management]], [[public relations]] (e.g., [[media relations]]), [[marketing]] and [[human resource management|human resources]], as well as wider [[organizational studies]],  [[communication theory]], [[social psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[political science]].

==History of internal communications==
[[Image:Lady Lever Art Gallery, Queen Mary's Drive, Port Sunlight - geograph.org.uk - 1491519.jpg|thumb|right|Lady Lever Art Gallery, built in 1888 as part of a model village for the workers of the Lever's soap factory - [[Port Sunlight]], UK]]
Large industrial organizations have a long history of promoting pride and a sense of unity among the employees of the company, evidenced in the cultural productions of Victorian-era soap manufacturers as far apart as the UK's Lever Brothers (right) and the [[Larkin Administration Building|Larkin Soap Company]] of Buffalo, New York.

Internal communications is fundamentally a management discipline, but as a discrete discipline of organizational theory it is correspondingly young. Stanford associate professor Alex Heron's ''Sharing Information with Employees'' (1943) is an outlier among texts which focus solely on the factors involved. Theorization in academic papers accelerated in the 1970s, but mainstream management texts mostly post-date 1990.

Writing in 2013, Ruck and Yaxley explore how the discipline evolved from the days of employee publications in the late 19th century.  As organisations became more complex, the impetus to communicate with employees grew and led to the emergence of an increasingly specialised discipline.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exploringinternalcommunication.com/what-can-we-learn-from-the-history-of-internal-communication/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of IC in the organization==

The purpose that a formally appointed IC manager or IC team will serve within a given organization will depend on the business context. In one, the IC function may perform the role of 'internal marketing' (i.e., attempting to win participants over to the management vision of the organization); in another, it might perform a 'logistical' service as channel manager; in a third, it might act principally as strategic adviser.

There is a practical distinction to make between managed communication and regular interactions among teams or between managers and subordinates. Minzberg&lt;ref&gt;cited in Hargie O and Tourish D eds, (2004) Handbook of Communication Audits for Organisations London Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; talks about the fact that communicating is intrinsic to the work of a manager - especially so in an [[information society]]. Interpersonal communications in the workplace are explored by writers such as Phillip Clampitt.&lt;ref&gt;Clampitt P, Communicating for Managerial Effectiveness, Sage 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of reasons why organisations should be concerned with internal communication. Employees are the heart and soul of an organization, thus it’s critical to pay attention to their needs. An engaged and committed employee work force increases and drives business results. Employee engagement encourages higher employee performance, results in lower turnover and offers competitive advantage. Even in a difficult economy, companies need to inspire and retain high performers.

Importantly, there is commonly a legal requirement for organizations to communicate with their workers.  In Europe, for example, the EU has made very specific provision about workers' rights to be informed and consulted with Directive 94/45/EC ([[Works council#European Works Council|Works Council]]).

Effective internal communications is commonly understood by practitioners to improve [[employee engagement]] (see, for example, the UK government-sponsored Macleod Report&lt;ref&gt;Macleod D,  Clarke N (2009) ''Engaging for Success: enhancing performance through employee engagement'', Department for Business Innovation and Skills, www.bis.gov.uk, http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file52215.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) and therefore to add significant value to organizations on metrics from productivity to customer research.

As noted in Quirke (2008):&lt;ref name="Quirke"&gt;Quirke, B. (2008). "Making the Connections; using Internal Communications to turn strategy into action", Burlington, VT: Gower Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt; "Traditionally, internal communications has focused on the announcement of management conclusions and the packaging of management thinking into messages for mass distribution to the 'troops'". Research indicates a limit to the value of this '[[broadcasting]]' model of IC. Without [[feedback]] loops and harnessing the active involvement and mediation skills of frontline supervisors or team leaders, broadcasting tends to be more effective at influencing senior and middle managers than frontline employees - see, e.g., Larkin and Larkin (1994).&lt;ref name="Larkin"&gt;Larkin, TJ and Larkin S. (1994). "Communicating Change: winning employee support for new business goals", New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the IC function matures within the organization, then, it may come to play a wider role in facilitating conversations "upwards", "downwards" and "across" the organization, ''per'' Stohl (1995).&lt;ref&gt;Stohl, C. (1995). "Organizational Communication: connectedness in action", Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations increasingly see IC as playing a role in external reputation management. Joep Cornelissen in his book ''Corporate Communications''&lt;ref&gt;Cornelissen, J. (2004). ''Corporate Communication: a guide to theory and practice", Thousand Oaks, CA: Sge Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; touches on the relationship between reputation and internal conversations. This trend reaches its full potential with the arrival of new 'norms' and customer expectations around [[social media]], for example in the work of Scoble and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Scoble R, Israel S. (2006) ''Naked Conversations: how blogs are changing the way businesses talk to customers'', Hoboken NJ, John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; Market researchers MORI&lt;ref&gt;Corporate responsibility: The communication challenge
Jenny Dawkins ''Journal of Communication Management'', 2004; p.108&lt;/ref&gt; have likewise highlighted the effects of employee advocacy on an organisation's external reputation.

IC managers try to get senior leaders to think strategically about how management decisions can be perceived internally and externally.  The focus of IC is often to ensure that employees can support a decision and understand how it impacts their work. An engaged employee is someone who is fully involved in, committed, and enthusiastic about his or her work. It’s the extent to which employees put discretionary effort into their work. Involvement of hearts as well as minds. The ability to work as a team across disciplines and functions. The understanding and commitment to achieving company goals and business context. Employee engagement speaks Engaged Employees Are More Productive to the level of trust in leadership, a belief that decisions are made in the best interests of the organization and its employees, and the level to which employees feel valued and appreciated. The more engaged, committed and inspired an employee is, the higher the employee performance, and the more impact on the bottom line.

==Internal communication strategy==

There are two sides to strategy in internal communications. In the first instance there is the organization's strategy — what it hopes to achieve and how it plans to go about achieving it. That strategy will be supported and, to some extent, delivered through effective internal communications.

In this context internal communication can help on several different levels:

* Tell: simply informing people of the direction, non-negotiable
* Sell: anticipating some form of backlash, requiring some persuasion
* Consult: seeking specific areas of input to the decision-making process
* Involve: seeking varying degrees of involvement and co-creation

Secondly, and more importantly, internal communications needs a strategy of its own. It should be positioned more than a simple plan of tactical interventions in support of business activities. The strategy should consider the following:

* Market: What does the organization know about its audiences' needs? How should its audiences be segmented?
* Message: What is it the organization's message is trying to achieve? In what tone should it be conveyed?
* Media: Which channels work best for the different audience segments? How will it maximize reach and cut-through? Are there clear editorial guidelines for each?
* Measurement: Are there clearly defined success criteria? What are the leading and lagging measures? As well as informing all of the other three M's, it should be used to demonstrate value and measures of performance (ROI, message penetration, hit rates, quality of feedback, etc.)

The strategy will inform the best way to organize effective communications.

Five general modes of IC practice are itemised below, ranked loosely according to their position along a spectrum from ''tactical'' to ''strategic'' activities.
[[Image:Tactical strategic IC.jpg|thumb|right|The modes of IC practice, arranged along a spectrum from the tactical to the strategic]]

===Message distribution===
Formal channels typically fall into one of four broad categories:{{cn|date=September 2018}}
*'''Electronic''': Communications that are delivered and/or accessed electronically, either by computer, telephone, television or other devices. Examples include [[E-mail|email]], [[intranet]], video and [[webcast]]s, [[DVD]], electronic [[newsletter]]s, [[podcast]]s, [[blog]]s, [[wiki]]s, [[voicemail]], conference calls, [[SMS]] text messaging, [[screensaver]] messaging, desktop news feeds, internal social media tools and team chat tools.

*'''Print''': Paper-based communications. Examples include [[magazine]]s, newsletters, brochures, postcards and other 'desk drops', posters, memos, communication packs or 'toolkits' for line managers, etc.
*'''Face-to-face''': One-to-one and one-to-many forums where people are physically present. Examples include a 'cascade' of team meetings or briefings, conferences, site visits, 'back to the floor', consultation forums, 'brown bag' lunches, round-table discussions, 'town meetings', etc.
*'''Workspace''': The working environment. Examples include notice boards, plasma and LCD screens, accessories (e.g.: mousemats), window decals, etc.

Informal channels reflect the non-linear dynamics of a [[social network]] and can be as influential, if not more so, than official channels, often more likely to stimulate and create [[discussion]] and [[dialogue]]. The channels may manifest themselves via the rumour-mill, water-cooler conversations, social networking, graffiti, spoof newsletters, etc.

==== Selecting channels ====
One of the key challenges any internal communicator will face is how to select the right channels - and the right mix of channels - for both the audience and the message. Bill Quirke&lt;ref name="Quirke"/&gt; offers a simplistic guide; See Weick&lt;ref&gt;Weick, K.E. (1995) "Sensemaking in Organizations", Thousands Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; for some theoretical grounds for this basic insight.

The practical considerations are:
*'''Availability''': what channels either already exist within the organisation or can be introduced effectively?
*'''Audience''': who are they, where are they based, how do they prefer to access information and how effective will the proposed channel be in reaching them and engaging them?
*'''Objectives''': what does the organisation want people to learn, think, feel or do as a result of the message?
*'''Content''': what is the context and substance of the message? (for example, sensitive messages may need to be communicated face-to-face, rather than by text message)
*'''Timing''': how urgent is the message? (for example, communications in times of crisis which require quick dissemination of important messages)

==== Traffic control ====
A typical large organisation IC function will be concerned to monitor and limit the ''quantity'' of information flowing through each internal channel, prioritising according to the relevance of a given message to the audience implicated in that channel, as well as the urgency and impact of the message. Such organisations typically face a risk that channels (such as [[intranet]] news, or [[email]]) are over-used for inappropriate, low value messages, causing vital audience groups to [[spam filter|filter]] them out.

==== Channel development and administration ====
IC teams will often (but not always) hold responsibility for the administration and development of several of the organisation's communications channels. The range of media available is wide - and growing fast with new electronic media. Initially, IC tends to focus on the existing resources of the organization, typically an [[intranet]], email distributions, and newsletters.

One common element of channel development and administration involves managing supplier relationships - agencies external to the organization typically specialise in one main channel area, such as audiovisual, or print production.

==== Line manager 'cascade' ====
Sending information down the line to local supervisors, expecting them to deliver it without any corruption, interpretation or deviation has long been the main focus of 'cascaded' internal communications (for example, UK guidance from The Industrial Society, now the [http://www.theworkfoundation.com/aboutus/ourhistory.aspx Work Foundation], focused on giving managers very clear instructions about what to say and how to say it). However, in recent years thinking has evolved and literature now concentrates on empowering managers to facilitate discussion rather than cascade management of messages which will have little authority or impact. This is a particularly strong theme in the writing of TJ and Sandar Larkin.&lt;ref name="Larkin"/&gt; Clampitt (2005) lists three approaches managers use to communicate with their employees.&lt;ref&gt;Clampitt, P. (2005). ''Communicating for Managerial Effectiveness'', Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;

Employee communication is an important skill for all line managers, irrespective of their seniority.  Like any skill it requires training and development.  Often, organisations do not invest the appropriate amount of time and effort in developing managers' communications skills. Too often this leads to managers abdicating responsibility for communications to their 'internal communications department' and a lack of confidence in facilitating discussion in their teams. This raises debate around the following issues:
* The nature of supervisory relationships and organisational communication
* The potency of managers as a channel of official communications
* How best to support managers in their roles

FitzPatrick and Valskov argue that strong manager communication systems attempt to address five essential issues:
* Do managers understand that communication is part of their role - in general and on specific occasions or topics?
* Do managers have access to more detailed background or context - rather than just be supplied with the same material as their teams?
* Have managers received training or development to support their role?
* Are manager supplied with materials to make their task easier?
* What attention is given to their feedback?&lt;ref&gt;FitzPatrick L &amp; Valskov V Internal Communication; a manual for practitioners, Kogan Page 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social media ====

Social media is becoming increasingly discussed in the field of internal communication. However, there is little documented, academic evidence of where it is being used successfully as part of a planned campaign of employee communications, and it is often confused with digital media. There are case studies published on a number of commercial websites including www.simply-communicate.com and www.melcrum.com, and there is a useful chapter on the subject by Tracy Playle in Ruck's ''Exploring Internal Communication''.

==== Other collaborative software ====

Since 2012, several communication technologies usually classified as workplace group chat apps or [[collaborative software]] have emerged.

===Message design and production===
Basic IC services to an organization begin with editorial services - either fine-tuning messages drafted by participants in the organization, or drafting new material on their behalf. IC practitioners might simply correct basic grammar, etc., especially in organisations where many participants may be operating in their second or third language. Or they might re-work it to conform to [[Style guide|house style]] or its branded equivalent, 'tone of voice'. The skillset involved relates closely to media professions such as [[journalism]], [[copywriting]] and [[Film production|film]] or [[Printing|print]] production. Message design may be iterative, or involve a range of participants in an approvals process.

===Project communications===
IC practitioners may be [[seconded]] to a specific project team, to support the stages of the project that carry a communications or engagement component. Project communicators might produce a schedule of communication objectives and milestones for the project; a map of vital stakeholders (senior individuals or large groups / segments of the overall population); and a message framework to guide project participants towards a single, coherent message about their work. They might also contribute to the project's aggregate risks 'log' on the reputational risks, and work-up contingency plans covering unintended situations.

==== Change communications ====
Most writers on the subject of communications talk about the idea of change.  Most intentional communication takes place with the aim of effecting some kind of change or another.  However, many practitioners in internal communications make a distinction between change and transformation.

Drawing on the work of writers such as William Bridges, practitioners talk of 'change' as the act of altering something within an organisation (such as the introduction of a new IT system or the closure of an office) and they describe 'transition' as the process through which an individual passes as part of the process of coping with change.  The use of the two terms interchangeably causes some confusion.  Communicators who specialise in change communications tend to be interested in behaviour change and will draw heavily on psychological models.

There are important contributions made to the debate about practice in this area by Herrero&lt;ref&gt;Herrero, L. "Viral change." Beaconsfield, UK: Meetingminds/The Chalfont Project (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and Quike.&lt;ref&gt;Quirke, Bill. Communicating corporate change: A practical guide to communication and corporate strategy. McGraw-Hill, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Crisis communications ====
Organizations occasionally face unplanned reputational crises which can destroy brand value or even finish the organization. At such moments, the support of the internal constituency becomes especially valuable, as employees' friends and relatives seek their account of events, and as talented and motivated participants consider whether or not to remain with the organization.

As with [[media relations]] and [[Public relations|PR]], the role IC plays in a crisis can be decisive for the success or failure of an organization, as it responds to a critical challenge. Organizations with a mature IC function may have contingency planning in place, ready to be tailored to the particulars of the situation. They are also more likely to have 'well flexed', well-rehearsed line management communications capability, making crisis communications more effective. Less mature IC functions may find it difficult to bring senior leaders' attention to the internal audience, when critical stakeholders such as investors or customers appear more likely to desert the organization.

Although unplanned and usually under-resourced, the quality of an IC function's response in a crisis often has a decisive impact in the maturing of an IC function within an organization. Effective responses bring IC up the list of priorities for senior leaders, following the crisis.

===Internal communication roles===

In recent years the practice of internal communications has professionalised.

In common with the [[Dave Ulrich|Ulrich model]] for [[human resources]] practice, IC may be delivered via a 'business partnering' relationship, acting as adviser to a given function or unit on IC issues relevant to the delivery of their strategic plans and projects. As a representative of the audiences with a stake in the developments under discussion, this can be both an awkward and a privileged position to occupy, requiring skills of diplomacy and objectivity.

==IC associations and accreditation==
There is not yet a globally recognised internal communication qualification, though various training courses and formal qualifications have been established to create and maintain standards.

In the UK, the accreditation bodies representing the profession offer competing qualifications. The UK's [[Chartered Institute of Public Relations]] offers training and qualifications in internal communications including Diploma and Certificate courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cipr.co.uk/courses/internal-communication-certificate |title=Internal Communication Certificate &amp;#124; Chartered Institute of Public Relations |publisher=Cipr.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also postgraduate Diploma or Masters programmes in Internal Communications Management at [[Kingston University]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingston.ac.uk/postgraduate-course/internal-communication-management-ma/ |title=Internal Communication Management Masters (MA) - London postgraduate courses - Kingston University London |publisher=Kingston.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, related courses are available at the [[University of Lugano]] in Switzerland and [[Rotterdam School of Management]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Susanna Marco |url=http://www.rsm.nl/executive-education/open-programmes/programmes/corporate-communication/employee-communication/overview/ |title=Employee Communication - Employee Communication - Corporate Communication - Programmes - Open Programmes - Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University |publisher=Rsm.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia, internal communications is still a very nascent field with few specialists in more developed economies such as Singapore and Hong Kong, some accredited by the Singapore Business Advisors and Consultants Council.

Professional IC associations include the [[Institute of Internal Communication]], the [[International Association of Business Communicators]] (IABC), and others. In 2013, IABC closed its Accredited Business Communicator qualification, but planned to launch a Certification Programme for Strategic Communicators in Autumn 2014.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Synonyms==
IC may variously be referred to as: employee communications, [[employee engagement]], [[employee relations]], internal marketing, company communications, staff communication. Responsibility for IC may sit within various established functions, including [[marketing]], [[corporate communications]], transformation, [[Human resources|HR]] and the CEO office. Internal communications functions can require several skills, e.g.: writing, marketing, event organisation, web production, facilitation, [[advertising]], stakeholder management, [[corporate social responsibility]], [[brand management|branding]] and communications training.

'''International finance''' (also referred to as '''international monetary economics''' or '''international macroeconomics''') is the branch of [[financial economics]] broadly concerned with [[monetary economics|monetary]] and [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] interrelations between two or more countries.&lt;ref name="Gandolfo 2002"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Finance and Open-Economy Macroeconomics | author = Gandolfo, Giancarlo | year = 2002 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin, Germany | isbn = 978-3-540-43459-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilbeam 2006"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Finance, 3rd Edition | author = Pilbeam, Keith | year = 2006 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-4039-4837-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; International finance examines the dynamics of the [[global financial system]], [[international monetary systems]], [[balance of payments]], [[exchange rates]], [[foreign direct investment]], and how these topics relate to [[international trade]].&lt;ref name="Gandolfo 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilbeam 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Macroeconomics | author = Feenstra, Robert C. | author2 = Taylor, Alan M. | year = 2008 | publisher = Worth Publishers | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-4292-0691-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes referred to as multinational finance, international finance is additionally concerned with matters of international [[corporate finance|financial management]]. Investors and [[multinational corporation]]s must assess and manage international risks such as [[political risk]] and [[foreign exchange risk]], including transaction exposure, economic exposure, and translation exposure.&lt;ref name="Madura 2007"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Management: Abridged 8th Edition | author = Madura, Jeff | year = 2007 | publisher = Thomson South-Western | location = Mason, OH | isbn = 0-324-36563-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Management, 6th Edition | author = Eun, Cheol S. | author2 = Resnick, Bruce G. | year = 2011 | publisher = McGraw-Hill/Irwin | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-07-803465-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of key concepts within international finance are the [[Mundell–Fleming model]], the [[optimum currency area]] theory, [[purchasing power parity]], [[interest rate parity]], and the [[international Fisher effect]]. Whereas the study of international trade makes use of mostly [[microeconomics|microeconomic]] concepts, international finance research investigates predominantly [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] concepts.

The three major components setting international finance apart from its purely domestic counterpart are as follows:
# [[International trade|Foreign exchange]] and political risks.
# [[Market imperfection]]s.
# Expanded [[opportunity set]]s.

These major dimensions of international finance largely stem from the fact that sovereign nations have the right and power to issue currencies, formulate their own economic policies, impose taxes, and regulate movement of people, goods, and capital across their borders.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2015"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Management, 7th Edition | author = Eun, Cheol S. | author2 = Resnick, Bruce G. | year = 2015 | publisher = McGraw-Hill/Irwin | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-07-786160-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Maryland]] to Thomas Francis Griffith and Euphemia Hill, Griffith came into prominence in the 1900s. Early 1900s had joined the International Accountants' Society, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;National Association of Accountants and Book-keepers, International Association of Office Men (1907). ''Business, the Magazine for Office, Store and Factory.'' p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; a home study school founded in 1903 in Chicago. There he was director of the Course in Systematizing,&lt;ref&gt;[[Arch Wilkinson Shaw]]. ''The Magazine of Business,'' A. W. Shaw Company, Vol. 7 (1905), p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; and published his first book on systematizing in 1905. Earlier in the 1900s he had published a series of articles in ''The Life Insurance Independent and American Journal of Life Insurance,''&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, James Bray. "A card system for the solicitor," in: ''The Life Insurance Independent and American Journal of Life Insurance,'' Vol. 15-16 (1903), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, James Bray.

[[File:American School of Correspondence.jpg|thumb|Head office of American School of Correspondence, 1912]]
Later in the 1900s Griffith joined the [[American School of Correspondence]], a distance education high school founded in 1897. For the Department of Commerce, Accountancy, and Business Administration Griffith wrote a series of instruction papers, among others on ''Advertising &amp; Sales Organization'' (1909), ''Purchasing and stores department'' (1909), ''Records of labor and manufacturing orders'' (1909), ''Theory of Accounts'' (1914).&lt;ref name="WES 1975"&gt;Stone, Williard E. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/40697359 Who Was Who in Accounting in 1909?]." ''The Accounting Historians Journal'' (1975): 6-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith was head of the Department of Commerce, Accountancy, and Business Administration until the late 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;American Technical Society (1920) ''Accountancy and Business Management.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Accounting Historians Journal,'' Vol. 1-3 (1981), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910 Griffith was Managing Editor of the ''Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration,'' a general reference work on accounting, auditing, bookkeeping, commercial law, business management, administrative and industrial organization, banking, advertising, selling, office and factory records, cost keeping, systematizing, etc.&lt;ref&gt;''Accountants' Index: A Bibliography of Accounting.'' (1921), p. 860.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darrell D. Dorrell, Gregory A. Gadawski (2012) ''Financial Forensics Body of Knowledge.'' p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== ''Systematizing,'' 1905 ===
[[File:Systematizing, 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|Systematizing, 1905]]
In the 1905 Griffith published his first work, entitled ''Systematizing.'' A 1907 review explained, that the demand for trained systematizers - men who have learned the science of business organization - is far greater that the supply. Such men experience no difficulty in securing lucrative positions, while those who engage in the work professionally soon attract as many clients as they can successfully serve.&lt;ref name="NAAB 1908"&gt;National Association of Accountants and Book-keepers, International Association of Office Men (1907) ''Business, the Magazine for Office, Store and Factory.'' (1908) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the review claimed that systematizing can be learned by means of the ''course'' in ''systematizing'' under personal direction of J.B. Griffith, who with the assistance of some experts, perfected the only practical plan of teaching systematizing and business organization offered by any institution. No other educational organization is prepared to offer such thorough instruction in the subjects embraced in this course. Like other business subjects, the only practical way to learn systematizing is by actual practice — actually systematizing a business - and that explains the success of the course.&lt;ref name="NAAB 1908"/&gt;

=== The system concept ===
In the 1905 ''Systematizing'' Griffith (1905) opened with stating that, before we can intelligently take up the study of [[system]], we must first consider what the term means. According to Griffith, the term system as applied to business is: 
* the plan under which the work of the entire business is carried on; 
* the plan for conducting each department and for taking care of every detail; 
* the method of recording the various transactions of the business and collecting information in such form that as will most clearly exhibit the condition of any department.&lt;ref name="B 1905 3-4"&gt;Bray (1905, p. 3-4)&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffith continued that, the key note of system is [[economy]]. A perfect system handles the details in a given department with the least possible labor. It unites the plan for handling these details into a harmonious whole for the quick and economical conduct of that particular department. The systems for conducting the various departments must in turn be united into a plan for the operation of the entire concern.&lt;ref name="B 1905 3-4"/&gt;

The result, according to Griffith, is a thoroughly systematized business—a complete machine—in which every department is operated and each detail handled without friction and with the smallest possible expenditure if time labour and expense.&lt;ref name="B 1905 3-4"/&gt;

=== Graphic illustration of the organization ===
[[File:Chart of Business Organization, 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|Chart of Organization]]
A really systematic organization, according to Griffith (1905), is one in which all of the departments work in harmony; in which every person in the establishment for the Executive head down, conforms to and performs his part of the work according to the system laid down. As applied to business concerns, the idea is best illustrated by a chart.&lt;ref name="B 1905 14-16"&gt;Bray (1905, p. 14-16)&lt;/ref&gt; Griffith explained:

{{quote|At the center of the organization is the executive with whom communication is established by those subordinates from whom he received reports and to whom he issues orders. From them the lines of communication lead directly to those in charge of the various departments under them and then on down to every employe.

While the illustration applies to a given class of concerns, this chart will give a very clear idea of how any business can be organized. If it be a jobbing business, the manufacturing departments would be omitted from the chart. In laying out the chart of any given concern it is necessary to carefully study every existing condition and the requirements of the business. Make the chart fit the business instead of trying to fit the business to a chart designed for some other concern.&lt;ref name="B 1905 14-16"/&gt;}}

At the end of the first chapter a chart is presented of a business organization (see image), which has similarities with both an [[organizational chart]] and [[mind map]]. The charts building blocks mention both business function (executive), departments (Mfg. Dept.; Selling Dept.; Accounting Dept.; etc.), records (Purchase Records; Sales Ledger; etc.), business activities (Time Keeping; Cost Accounting; etc.), and cost accounting classes (Labour Direct; Labour Indirect; etc.). In a similar way organization departments had been pictured by Griffith, such as the Purchasing Department, Stock Department and Advertising Department (see below).

&lt;gallery caption="Charts of organization departments, 1905" widths=180 heights=300 class=center&gt;
File:Chart of Purchasing Department, 1905.jpg|alt=Chart of Purchasing Department, 1905|Chart of Purchasing Department, 1905

File:Chart of Advertising Department, 1905.jpg|alt=Chart of Advertising Department, 1905|Chart of Advertising Department, 1905
&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[File:Chart of Duties, Responsibilities and Authorities of Department Heads, 1909.jpg|thumb|Chart of Duties, Responsibilities and Authorities of 
Department Heads, 1909]]
The presentation of these kind of preliminary organizational charts was rather rare in those days. The work itself has similarities with the series of system charts, [[Horace Lucian Arnold]] had published two years earlier in his 1903 ''The Factory manager and accountant.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnold, Horace L.]] (1903). ''The Factory manager and accountant, some examples of the latest American factory practice; collected and arranged by Horace Lucian Arnold (Henry Roland).'' The Engineering Magazine company. p. 317-332.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is remarkable, that these diagrams were also not republished in Griffith's later works. Griffith did develop the concept into a single chart of the Duties, Responsibilities and Authorities of Department Heads (see image), which was first published in Griffith's ''Administrative and industrial organization'' (1909), and republished in the 1910 ''Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration,''&lt;ref&gt;''Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration,'' (1910) Vol 4, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these efforts to introduce these visual aids, they didn't become that popular yet. In the 1920s a survey revealed that organizational charts were still not common among ordinary business concerns, but they were beginning to find their way into administrative and business enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Hamilton institute]] (1923) ''[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.35128001192606 Organization charts].'' p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charting factory layout and routing ===
Another feature Griffith demonstrated in his work ''Systematizing'' and later works is the charting of factory layout and routing. In ''Systematizing'' he gave one example in the third section about "The Stock Department,"  where as example he illustrated two arrangements, or [[routing diagram]]s, for handling lumber:
 
&lt;gallery caption="Arrangement for handling lumber, 1905" widths= 240 heights=300 class=center&gt;
File:Arrangement for handling lumber (1), 1905.jpg |alt=Arrangement for handling lumber (I) |I: Arrangement for handling lumber
File:Arrangement for handling lumber (2), 1905.jpg |alt=Arrangement for handling lumber (II)|II: Arrangement for handling lumber
&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[File:Layout and Routing of a Typical Manufacturing Plant, 1909.jpg|thumb|420px|III: Layout and Routing of a Typical Manufacturing Plant, 1909]]
Griffith explained, that the arrangement of the stock should be such that all unnecessary handling will be avoided. The references in Section Whether it be the store house of a country store or the supply room of an immense factory, the stock most often required should be placed where it can be readily removed, while that seldom called for may be stored in the more inaccessible corners. Where the concern is large enough to require several storage places, these storage places for the different classes of stock should be located with special reference to the departments in which the stock is used.&lt;ref name="G 1905 73-74"&gt;Griffith (1905, p. 73-74)&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose the location of lumber yard, dry kiln, lumber shed and factory to be such as shown in Fig. I. Note How the lumber must travel back and forth, crossing the same space three times. Compare this with the arrangement shown in Fig. II.The lumber is taken the shortest possible distance and never goes over the same ground twice. Where buildings have been permanently located it may not be possible to change the general plan, but improvements can be made in nearly all cases. Take the plan in Fig. I: If the lumber yard was located immediately back of the dry kiln, at least 25 per cent of the labor of handling the lumber would be saved. The plans which we have shown illustrate examples of good and bad system in the location of one class of stock.&lt;ref name="G 1905 73-74"/&gt;

The layout and routing of a typical manufacturing plant are often more complex, see for example figure III, but the principles remain the same.&lt;ref&gt;Griffth (1909, p. 37)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- 
=== Charting business procedures and business processes ===
--&gt;

=== Documenting Policies and Procedures ===
In ''Systematizing'' Griffith showed to be a proponent of documenting policies and procedures. He argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As to the form that an order should take, the only satisfactory form is the written order ... If the request is in writing neither [the sender nor the recipient] is obliged to depend on his memory. The written order removes all chance of dispute as to its conditions, neither can there be a question of the authority of an order which bears the signature of the head of a department ... Another great advantage of the written order is that the head of a department may keep copies and follow-up each order to see that it is properly executed.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith (1905, p. 19-20); as cited in: [[Yates, JoAnne]], ''[https://archive.org/stream/creatingorganiza00yate Creating organizational memory : systematic management and internal communication in manufacturing firms, 1880-1920]'' Cambridge, Mass. : Sloan School of Management. 1988. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[JoAnne Yates|Yates]] (1988) commented that "the written order, whether to an individual or to the whole company, became part of organizational memory rather than just individual memory. It was then available for whatever future needs might arise."&lt;ref&gt;Yates (1988, p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manufacturing Costs === 
[[File:Chart of Manufacturing Costs, 1905.jpg|thumb|280px|Chart of Manufacturing Costs, 1905]]
The tenth section of ''Systematizing'' focussed on manufacturing costs. Griffith started explaining that a cost system in any manufacturing plant is a necessity, yet in those days there were many manufacturers who hadn't discover its importance. With cost systems Griffith meant a system by means of which the actual costs of manufacturing the product can be accurately determined.&lt;ref name="B 1905 355-86"&gt;Bray (1905, p. 355-86)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the chapter Griffith present a chart of manufacturing cost (see image). This chart is a graphic illustration of the items which enter into the cost of manufacture, the manner in which these items are obtained and, finally, brought together in a permanent form. Griffith commented, that "a study of this chart will enable the student to outline a general plan for a cost system suited to the needs of his particular factory. When the general principles of the cost finding system are understood, it becomes merely a matter of detail to apply those principles to individual factories."&lt;ref name="B 1905 355-86"/&gt;
&lt;!--
=== Voucher system and accounting chart ===
--&gt;

=== ''Accountancy and business management,'' 1909/1921 ===
In 1909 Griffith edited his first book series, entitled "Accountancy and business management." This book series was published in seven volumes and was prepared by a corps of auditors, accountants, attorneys, and specialists in business methods and management, and illustrated with over fifteen hundred engravings. The second edition was published 1921 by the American Technical Society in Chicago.

The table of contents of "Accountancy and business management" was:
:I. Organization, sales, credits, billing, shipping.	
:II. Bookkeeping, accounting, partnerships, manufacturing, voucher records.	
:III. Purchasing, labor records, cost finding, mail order, special forms.	
:IV. Auditing, combinations, corporations, profits, practice.	
:V. Contracts, agency, sales, bills, notes, evidence.	
:VI. Correspondence filing, office devices, department stores.	
:VII. Income tax problems, commercial arithmetic, index.

Griffith had written several section such as the first chapter on "business organization and control", in 1909 also published under the title "Administrative and industrial organization." Another chapter by Griffith, entitled "the voucher system and accounting charts," was in 1917 republished as "Corporation Accounts and Voucher System."

Griffith also wrote the section on "Purchasing and stores" co-authored with W. J. Graham, and the section on "Credits."&lt;ref&gt;''Subscription Books Bulletin,'' Vol. 1-8. (1930). p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; A significant part of the co-authors and collaborators also participated in the 1910 "Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration." Furthermore also a significant part of the content, and almost all illustrations were used in that 1910 business encyclopedia.

=== Segregation of authority ===
In the article "business organization and control" in ''Accountancy and business management,'' (1909) Griffith argued, that the segregation of authority is an universal principles of organization. This purpose of segregation of authority is to simplify, as [[Charles Edward Knoeppel]] (1908) had argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While business as it is now conducted is not as simple as it was in the barter days, it must not be inferred that this segregation of authority is synonymous with complexity, for its very purpose has been to simplify, and that is what it has accomplished. It is only where this segregation has been the result of lack of thought and proper attention, or other like causes, that we find a complex and unsatisfactory condition of affairs. In fact, there is all about us sufficient evidence that many commercial enterprises are being conducted along lines that, as far as evolutional development is concerned, are several stages behind the times.&lt;ref name="Kn 1908 p. 85-86"&gt;Knoeppel (1908), "Maximum Production Through Organization and Supervision" p. 85-86; Cited in: J.B. Griffith (ed.), ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46424 Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration...: Organization; sales; credits; statistics.]'' American School of Correspondence. Vol. 1. 1910. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Griffith in the ''Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration'' (1910) commented, that "when we go into all of the ramifications of business we find many establishments where minor variations of our plan of organization appear necessary, but in the final analysis, the fundamentals prove to be the same."&lt;ref&gt;Griffith (1910, p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt; The working authorities in a manufacturing Business and in a trading Business follow a same scheme (see images).

&lt;gallery caption="Segregation of authority, 1908/10" widths= 240 heights=400 class=center&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== ''Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration,'' 1910 ===
[[File:Cyclopedia of Commerce Advertisement, 1910.jpg|thumb|Cyclopedia of Commerce, 1910&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement for ''Cyclopedia of Commerce,'' in: ''[[Popular Mechanics]],'' April 1910, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1910 the American School of Correspondence published the ''Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration,'' and Griffith had been managing editor. Other authors and collaborators of this work were [[Robert Hiester Montgomery]], [[Arthur Lowes Dickinson]], William M. Lybrand of [[Coopers &amp; Lybrand]], [[Oscar E. Perrigo]] and [[Halbert Powers Gillette]]. Among the authorities consulted were [[Horace Lucian Arnold]], [[Charles Buxton Going]], Lawrence R. Dicksee, [[Francis W. Pixley]], [[Charles U. Carpenter]], [[Charles Edward Knoeppel]], [[Harrington Emerson]], [[Clinton Edgar Woods]], [[Charles Ezra Sprague]] and [[Charles Waldo Haskins]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, James Bray. (ed.) et al. ''Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration.'' p. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1913 review in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]],'' commented that this treatise evidently aims to give a complete review of the entire field of [[accounting]]. The volumes start out with a discussion of the theory of accounts, and then proceed to show the methods of keeping the books of various kinds of organizations, from single proprietors to corporations, and of different kinds of businesses, including wholesale and retail establishments, banks, mail-order houses, hotels, insurance companies, and contracting firms.&lt;ref name = "CAS 1913"&gt;Charles A. Sweetland. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1819776 Reviewed Work: Cyclopedia of Practical Accounting by James B. Griffith]," in: ''Journal of Political Economy,'' Vol. 21, No. 9 (Nov., 1913), pp. 876-877.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1913 review continued, that to one who is familiar with accounting practice, the books contain much suggestive material. Unfortunately the data are poorly organized and there is unnecessary repetition both in text and in illustrative material. The discussion of the theory of accounts is hardly more than an exposition of bookkeeping terminology. The last volume contains a number of "Practical Accounting Problems and Solutions." The compilers of the cyclopedia were unfortunate in picking some of their solutions, notably to Problems 49 and 50. These two solutions appear in the volume of a well-known writer' and are incorrect. Incidentally, the editor of the set neglects to give credit to the author of the solutions, either in a footnote or in the list of "Authorities Consulted." This part of the work would also have been materially improved if solutions for Problems 30 to 47 had been given. The review ends with the remark, that from a mechanical point of view the books are excellent; the half-tone illustrations are especially good and are well selected.&lt;ref name = "CAS 1913"/&gt;

== Reception ==
In his days the work of Griffith was occasionally placed inline with the work of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], [[Harrington Emerson]], and [[Henry L. Gantt]].&lt;ref name="NAH 1913"/&gt;
In the 1975 article "Who is who in accounting in 1909" the accounting historian Williard E. Stone&lt;ref&gt;[[Vangermeersch, Richard G.J.]] "[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/cdm/ref/collection/aah/id/29060 Williard E. Stone, life member of the Academy]," in: ''Accounting Historians Notebook,'' 1993, Vol. 16, no. 1 (spring), pp. 12&lt;/ref&gt; listed Griffith among the foremost authors and collaborators in the field in the year 1909. More in general he explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The early 1900s were a [[Horatio Alger, Jr.|Horacio Alger]] time when self improvement, particularly in business knowledge, was a way of life for aspiring people. A large number of business encyclopedias enjoyed a wide distribution. One such compendium, ''Accountancy and Business Management,'' modest subtitle 'A General Reference. Work on Bookkeeping, Accounting, Auditing, Commercial Law, Business Organization, Business Management, Banking, Advertising, Selling, Office and Factory Records, Cost Keeping, Systematizing, etc.,' offered the complete 'body of knowledge' for the young business person in seven small volumes ...&lt;ref name="WES 1975"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of the twenty-one authors and collaborators in the field of accounting, listed by Stone (1975), only eight of them were actually accountants.&lt;ref name="WES 1975"/&gt;

'''Milfe Dacula''', better known by her [[stage name]] '''Klaudia Koronel''' (born 19 December 1975 in [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Philippines]]&lt;ref name="gma"/&gt;), is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] businesswoman and former actress.

==Career==
She did sexy movies such as ''Pisil'' (1998) with Rodel Velayo, ''Kesong Puti'' (1999) with [[Roy Rodrigo]], and ''Anakan Mo Ako'' (1999) with Gino Ilustre. She appeared in action movies with [[Monsour del Rosario]] in ''Dugo Ng Birhen: El Kapitan'' (1999), [[Jeric Raval]] in ''Sagot Ko Ang Buhay Mo'' (2000), [[Lito Lapid]] in ''Pasasabugin Ko Ang Mundo Mo'' (2000), and [[Ronnie Ricketts]] in ''Mano Mano 2'' (2001). Koronel was appeared in comedy films like ''Torotot'' (2001) with [[Leo Martinez]], and ''Kapitan Ambo: Outside De Kulambo'' (2001) with [[Eddie Garcia]].

She was one of the leading ladies in the TV sitcom [[Kiss Muna]] (2000-2001) with [[Joey de Leon]], aired in [[GMA Network]]. She was included in the cast of [[ABS-CBN]] TV series [[Mga Anghel na Walang Langit]] (2005-2006). 
 
Koronel was nominated for [[Gawad Urian Award]] as Best Supporting Actress for ''[[Live Show (film)|Live Show]]'' (2000).

==Personal life==
Koronel was born as Milfe Dacula and the eldest of six children in a small community in Zamboanga del Sur, Philippines. Her father was a carpenter and her mother was a beautician. Her parents separated during her childhood. After her mother abandoned their home, Milfe had to care for her father who then left her and young siblings to their grandmother when he went to the capital, Manila.&lt;ref name="gmanetwork.com"&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/showbiz/chikaminute/353478/frontal-nudity-nagtulak-kay-klaudia-koronel-para-talikuran-ang-pagpapa-sexy-sa-pelikula/story/?ref=related_stories&lt;/ref&gt;

The former actress told her bitter childhood experience of physical abuse from her father who sometimes had her chained. She detailed that he strikes her head with a cooking ladle and he'll only stop if he sees blood on her forehead and face. Afterwards he'll cry and say, "It's your fault." Those kind of incidents are the reasons she harbored negative feelings against her father during that time.&lt;ref name="gmanetwork.com"/&gt;

Despite the situation her broken family was in, she never thought of rebelling and only focused on her schooling under the guidance of her strict but responsible grandmother. She remembers crossing rivers on foot and wading in garbage-filled waters just to reach and attend school.

As a young adult, she also had to leave her provincial life to escape poverty and seek a better life in Manila. To survive, Koronel worked waitress jobs at the restaurant where she met the movie producer, Robbie Tan who was scouting for new talent that can replace the famous sexy actress, Rosanna Roces. She initially rejected his job offer as she's naturally timid, shy, and never dreamt of being a movie actress but later changed her mind due to the bad treatment she received from the poor environment she was in, hoping the opportunity would turn her fortune around.&lt;ref name="gmanetwork.com"/&gt;

Koronel's decision for movie fame gave her success in 1997 when was launched as a sexy actress and she starred in a series of successful movies. Her sudden fame and fortune did not make her forget to care for her younger siblings and even both her estranged parents.

At the height of Koronel's acting career and fame, she left the industry after her movie, "Live Show" (Toro) and decided to complete her college education in [[New Era University]] with a degree in [[Bachelor of Sciences|BS]] [[Computer Science]] in 2005. She started her own Internet business soon afterwards.

Koronel got married to Andy Zhang, a [[Chinese people|Chinese]]-[[Americans|American]] businessman, on August 28, 2009 at the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] Temple in [[Diliman]], [[Quezon City]], Philippines. The couple moved to [[Gilbert, Arizona]], USA where her spouse, Andy, set up a homecare business for her.

After one year, it was reported that the couple separated but remained as friends. Every year, she visits her only son, Zandy, (born in 2006) who is in the care of her family in Laguna, Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pep.ph/news/62311/former-sexy-actress-klaudia-koronel-diagnosed-with-uterine-tumor#ljXyH8kDqwD7Fbam.99&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1918">'''Leopold vel Liber Landsberg''' (10 June 1861 in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] – 4 June 1935 in [[Łódź]], Poland), Jewish industrialist in Russia and Poland. 

He was the youngest son of Mendel Landsberg, a tradesman in Warsaw, and Laia Lewin. His elder brethren [[Hilary Landsberg]] (1834–1898) and [[Alexander Landsberg]] (1859–1928) were clothing manufacturers in [[Tomaszów Mazowiecki]].  

In 1885, Leopold Landsberg settled in Łódź and opened his factory (at Lonkowa Street), producing female clothing. By World War I, goods were selling to Russian markets. In 1905, as many as 70 workers employed in his factory. 
He was a treasurer of the Union of the Łódź Manufacturers. He belonged to the owners of the Joint-Stock Company of Cloth Factories in Tomaszów Mazowiecki.

After World War I, Leopold Landsberg's factory called “the Mechanical Weaving Mill of Wool Products” (in Polish “Tkalnia Mechaniczna Wyrobów Wełnianych”) was situated at Srodmiejska Street. Many wool goods were selling in local (Polish) market.
  
He was a president of the Jewish Association for Caring of the Sicks “Bykur Cholim”. 

He died in Łódź and was buried in the Jewish Cemetery in Łódź at Bracka Street (Left side, Section D, tomb No. 107). His wife Sara (Sura) Salomea Hirschberg (1861–1944), daughter of Yehuda and Rayzla née Birnbaum, was buried in the neighbouring grave (No. 106).

'''Levent''' is a neighbourhood and one of the main [[business district]]s of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], located on the [[Europe]]an side of the city. It is a part of the municipality of [[Beşiktaş]] which is situated to the north of the [[Golden Horn]], at the western shore of the [[Bosphorus]] [[strait]].

Levent is in direct competition with the nearby [[Maslak]] business district for new [[skyscraper]] projects. One of the major skyscraper clusters of the city is located here, well hidden behind the hills of the [[Bosphorus]], and not disturbing the atmosphere of the [[Constantinople|historical peninsula]] of Istanbul, which is at quite a distance.

Levent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/zo/?id=100015 Emporis: Levent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314100018/http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/zo/?id=100015 |date=2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; hosts the tallest completed skyscraper of Turkey, the 54-floor [[Istanbul Sapphire|Sapphire]],&lt;ref name=Sapphire&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=kilertower-istanbul-turkey Emporis: Sapphire]&lt;/ref&gt; which has a roof height of 238 metres (261 metres including its spire).&lt;ref name=Sapphire/&gt;

The stations ''Gayrettepe'', ''Levent'' and ''4. Levent'' along the [[M2 (Istanbul Metro)|M2]] line of the [[Istanbul Metro]] serve the Levent business district and its surrounding neighbourhoods.

==Etymology==
[[File:LeventPano3.jpg|thumb|left|Büyükdere Avenue in Levent, with the [[Finansbank]] headquarters (formerly Soyak Crystal Tower) at right.]]

Levent is also a name for men in Turkey (cf. [[Levent (name)|Levent]]) that derives from the ''[[Levend]]'', a type of soldier ([[marines|naval infantry]]) of the [[Ottoman Navy]].&lt;ref name=Levend&gt;[http://www.barbaros.biz/OSMANLI_DONANMASI_KIYAFETLERI.htm Kıyafet-i Asakir-i Bahriyye: Costumes and ranks of the Ottoman Navy]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Levend'' itself has derived from ''Levantino'' ([[Levant]]ine) which means ''Person from the [[Levant]] (East Mediterranean)'' in [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref name=Levend/&gt;&lt;ref name=DAFN&gt;Dictionary of American Family Names, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-508137-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was how the Italians (the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]]) used to call the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sailors, a name which was also adopted by the Ottoman Turks.&lt;ref name=Levend/&gt;&lt;ref name=DAFN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nisanyan&gt;[[Sevan Nişanyan]]. ''Sözlerin Soyağacı: Çağdaş Türkçenin Etimolojik Sözlüğü''. URL: http://www.nisanyansozluk.com/search.asp?w=levent{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 30 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word ''levend'' for describing seamen first appeared in the [[Ottoman Turkish language]] during the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Nisanyan/&gt; These marine soldiers had the reputation of possessing strong, muscular physiques and daring, fearless characters; which is the reason why the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word ''levent'', its [[Greek language|Greek]] [[cognate]] ''[[Leventis|levénti]]'' (λεβέντη) and its [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] cognate ''levént'' (левент) are still popularly used for defining "athletic, gallant, brave" men.&lt;ref name=DAFN/&gt;

The name Levent (''Levend'') came to be applied to the neighbourhood because in 1780 the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Kapudan Pasha|Fleet Admiral]] [[Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha]] was awarded a farmland here by the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdülhamid I]]; and in the early 19th century a military compound was built in the area of this farm.&lt;ref&gt;Haldun Hürel. ''Semtleri, Mahalleri, Caddeleri ve Sokakları A'dan Z'ye İstanbul'un Alfabetik Öyküsü''. İkarus, 2008. {{ISBN|978-975-999-290-3}}. Page 220.&lt;/ref&gt; The nearby [[İstinye]] neighbourhood on the European shoreline of the [[Bosphorus]] also featured an important shipyard and dock for maintaining and repairing the military vessels of the [[Ottoman Navy]]. However, the [[Imperial Arsenal (Ottoman Empire)|Imperial Arsenal]] (''Tersâne-i Âmire'') and the Naval Ministry (''Bahriye Nezareti'') of the Ottoman Navy were located on the shores of the [[Golden Horn]].

==History==
[[File:KanyonTower.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kanyon Shopping Mall|Kanyon Towers &amp; Mall]] on Büyükdere Avenue in Levent, with [[Istanbul Sapphire]] in the background.]]
[[File:The Bosphorus Bridge (8425286568).jpg|thumb|Heading towards Levent through the [[Bosphorus Bridge]] and [[Otoyol 1|O-1 motorway]].]]

In the early 19th century, during the final years of the reign of Sultan [[Selim III]], the first military compound of the [[Nizam-ı Cedid|Nizam-ı Cedid (New Order) Army]] was built in Levent; which was then known as the ''Levend Çiftliği'' (Levend Farmlands), eventually becoming known as the ''Levend Kışlası'' (Levend Barracks).

In 1868, during the first territorial organization of the Istanbul Municipality, Levend (Levent) was placed within the district of [[Beşiktaş]] (which was designated as the ''7th Area'' of the Istanbul Municipality), having remained within this district ever since.

The modern neighbourhood of Levent was formed in 1947, when Emlak Kredi Bankası (a Turkish bank which was established to finance housing projects) chose the Levent area for constructing a well-planned residential compound, formed mostly of [[villa]] type houses with gardens. After the completion of the first phase of the Levent project in 1960, numerous other residential compounds were constructed in the area, eventually extending towards nearby [[Etiler]].

Starting from the late 1980s and early 1990s, with initial projects such as the [[Sabancı Center]], [[Yapı ve Kredi Bankası|Yapı Kredi Towers]], TAT Towers, [[MetroCity AVM|Metrocity Towers]] and [[Isbank Tower 1|İş Bankası Towers]], Levent became a popular location for constructing new [[skyscraper]]s, mostly owned by Turkish [[bank]]s and [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]]. One of the city's major [[skyline]] clusters (together with those of [[Maslak]] and [[Şişli]] on the European side; and [[Ataşehir]] and [[Kozyatağı]] on the Asian side of Istanbul) is located in Levent. At present, Levent hosts the tallest skyscraper of Istanbul and Turkey, the 54-floor [[Istanbul Sapphire]]; while the construction of numerous new [[mixed-use development|mixed-use skyscraper projects]] and [[shopping mall]]s are ongoing in the neighbourhood, which has evolved into a [[central business district]].

'''Mesoscale manufacturing''' is the process of creating components and products in a range of approximately from 0.1mm to 5mm with high accuracy and precision using a wide variety of engineering materials. Mesomanufacturing processes are filling the gap between macro- and micromanufacturing processes and overlaps both of them. (see picture). Other manufacturing technologies are [[Nanoscopic scale|nanoscale]] (&lt; 100&amp;nbsp;nm), microscale (100&amp;nbsp;nm to 100&amp;nbsp;µm) and macroscale manufacturing (&gt; 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://aspe.net/|title = Mesoscale and Microscale Manufacturing Processes: Challenges for Materials, Fabrication and Metrology.|last = Dow|first = T. A.|date = Winter 2003|journal = American Society for Precision Engineering|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Scattergood|first2 = R. O.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Application of mesomanufacturing include [[electronics]], [[biotechnology]], [[optics]], [[medicine]], [[avionics]], [[communication]]s, and other areas. Specific applications include [[mechanical watch]]es, and extremely small motors and bearings; lenses for cameras and other micro parts for mobile telephones; micro-batteries, mesoscale fuel cells, microscale pumps, valves, and mixing devices for microchemical reactors; biomedical implants, microholes for fiber optics; medical devices such as stents and valves; mini nozzles for high-temperature jets; mesoscale molds; desktop- or micro-factories, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://manufacturingscience.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/journal.aspx|title = Micro/Meso-scale Manufacturing|last = Dohda|first = Kuniaki|date = November 2004|journal = Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Ni|first2 = Jun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processes==

Manufacturing in the mesoscale can be accomplished by scaling down macroscale manufacturing processes or scaling up nanomanufacturing processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Manufacturing, Engineering &amp; Technology|last = Kalpakjian|first = Serope|publisher = Pearson Education|year = 2006|isbn = 0-13-148965-8|location = |pages = 858|last2 = Schmid|first2 = Steven R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macroscale techniques like mill and lathe machining have been successful used to create features in the range of 25&amp;nbsp;µm. Meso [[Machine tool]]s (mMTs), for example miniaturized milling machine, is a expansion of using traditional macroscale techniques to manufacture mesoscale products. With the limitation of self-excited vibration of machine tools and fatigue, microassembly and micro- and mesoscale milling are created to improve the maximum stiffness and dynamic operation of the milling process, which improves the overall performance of manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Adaptively tuned micromanipulator and fixturing mechanism for micro and mesoscale manufacturing|url = http://gradworks.umi.com/37/16/3716914.html|publisher = UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA|date = 2014-01-01|first = Paul Michael|last = Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of mMTs has revealed many challenges that are specific to machining at the small scales. These challenges stem from the large influence of grain size at small scales and the necessity of extremely small tolerances for both the machine tools and the measuring tools.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Laser cutting|Laser machining]] is a traditional technique that uses nanosecond pulses of ultraviolet light to create mesoscale features like holes, fillets, etc.  The removal of material during laser machining is proportional to exposure time and therefore this process can be used to create three dimensional features.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A less traditional technique is to use [[focused ion beam]] sputtering (FIB) to remove material. This process involves focusing a beam of ions, like from [[gallium]], to the work piece and this causes material to be removed. Using FIB sputtering has a relatively low rate of material removal and therefore has limited application.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Electrical discharge machining]] (EDM) is another subtractive manufacturing process used in the mesoscale. This process requires that electricity be transferred between the tool [[electrode]] and the work piece and therefore it can only be used to manufacture materials that conduct electricity. One advantage of EDM is that it can be used on hard materials that do not work well in traditional machining processes, such as titanium.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2001/011708.pdf|title = Meso-Machining Capabilities|last = Benavides|first = Gilbert L.|date = June 2001|work = |access-date = |via = |publisher = Sandia National Laboratories|last2 = Adams|first2 = David P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6202">'''Popkomm''' was an international trade show for the music and [[entertainment]] business during the 1990s and 2000s, and also integrated a congress and festival. It was held in Cologne for most of its existence, later moved to Berlin with entries from at least 55 other countries.

== History ==

Popkomm first took place in [[Düsseldorf]] in 1989, and at the time was a meeting place of little-known independent musicians. In 1990 Popkomm moved to [[Cologne]], and had already become an international meeting place of the industry. Cologne hosted the show until 2003 when then relocated to [[Berlin]] in 2004. 
In Berlin the event developed into one of the three biggest international music b2b events, until the organizing Popkomm GmbH postponed the event in 2009 for one year due to reclining revenues. In 2010, Popkomm was reactivated as part of the umbrella brand [[Berlin Music Week]] and took place at the [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]]. The final event was in 2011, after which it was shut down.&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/global/1084508/popkomm-shuts-down-berlin-music-week-reeperbahn-fest-musikmesse-and| title=Popkomm Shuts Down; Berlin Music Week, Reeperbahn Fest, Musikmesse, and Other German Fests Rise| author=Wolfgang Spahr| date=July 24, 2012| website=Billboard| publisher=| accessdate=June 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The congress==

The Popkomm Congress was an event where important industry issues were discussed, new developments were introduced and information was presented by international representatives of the business. For trade visitors there were panels with prominent figures and keynote speakers from the highest tiers of the music business. Figures such as [[Feargal Sharkey]], former lead singer of the [[The Undertones|Undertones]] and chairman of the UK’s Live Music Forum, [[Gilberto Gil]], world-famous musician and Minister of Culture of Popkomm’s partner country Brazil, [[Claude Nobs]], founder of the legendary Montreux Jazz Festival, and boy group impresario Lou Pearlman were all present at Popkomm 2006.
In 2007 the main topics were [[digital music]], [[live music]], [[mobile entertainment]] and the [[creative industries]]. In addition to highlighting these issues Popkomm also organised attractions by country, for example in 2006 the focus was on [[Japan]], [[Brazil]] and [[Russia]].
In 2010, the congress took place at the airport Tempelhof and was organized by a2n, all together now.

== The marketplace ==

For people in the business Popkomm was a significant trade show, which gave the industry a strong economic boost and in terms of cultural politics exerted an important influence. For years numerous labels, majors and indies, distributors, publishers and enterprises close to the music industry have been represented at Popkomm. With a display area covering 16,000 square metres, a total of 817 exhibitors, 589 of whom were from 55 countries outside [[Germany]], attendance far in excess of 15,000 trade visitors, Popkomm 2006 broke all previous records. However, over the years it has not only been the number of exhibitors, the total of countries represented, and visitor attendance which have been rising, but also the volume of successful talks and deals taking place at this trade fair. Following Popkomm 2006, 72 per cent of exhibitors and 41 per cent of trade visitors reported concluding successful business. In 2010, for the first time in its history Popkomm introduced a B2C marketplace reaching out to the end consumer.

== The festival==

In addition to the trade show and the congress the third element of Popkomm’s threefold concept was a festival. In 2006 Popkomm organised stage performances by over 2,000 musicians from 26 countries, over 400 acts performed more than 600 hours of live music at 30 clubs in Berlin, in front of audiences totalling 70,000. Among the big names in 2006 were [[Billy Talent]], [[Chicks on Speed]], [[Joy Denalane]], [[Kaizers Orchestra]], [[¡Forward, Russia!]], [[the Aggrolites]], [[the Long Blondes]], [[Sugarplum Fairy]], [[Juliette and the Licks]] and [[Lunik]].

== Popkomm IMEA: the awards ==

Popkomm IMEA stands for the ”Innovation in Music and Entertainment Awards“, these were presented in recognition of innovative business ideas by people in the music industry with a focus on young enterprises who are making a name for themselves with, for instance, creative ideas on digital music marketing or mobile entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard - 17 Sept. 2005 - Page 27 Popkomm 2O05 features a revitalized program of events at the Berlin Exhibition Grounds, including the second annual Popkomm-IMEA (Innovation in Music and Entertainment) Awards taking place Sept. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popkomm Classics ==

[[Classical music]] is popular and the market for classical music is growing noticeably. Popkomm tapped into this trend years ago and made Popkomm Classics a successful part of its concept. [[Label]]s, associations, publishers and classical music media were represented at the Classic Lounge, a place where they could showcase new and innovative trends of the classical music market, and where they could promote an exchange of views by meeting interesting people and holding constructive talks in a relaxed atmosphere. Classical music was also an integral part of the Popkomm Congress. In 2006 the panels discussed innovative educational programmes and the power of classical music. In 2006 "ReComposed by [[Jimi Tenor]]“ celebrated a world premiere at Berlin's Deutsche Oper.

'''RCA Open-Source Application''' ('''ROSA''') is an [[open-source software|open-source]] management accounting application that aims to provide decision support information to managers. [[Resource consumption accounting]] (RCA) is a principle-based approach to [[management accounting]] that combines German management accounting techniques known as [[Grenzplankostenrechnung]] (GPK) with a disciplined form of activity-based costing.

ROSA uses resource consumption accounting (RCA) which is internationally recognized as the most robust form of cost management measurement for providing marginal cost analytics.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC) [http://web.ifac.org/publications/professional-accountants-in-business-committee/information-papers-1#evaluating-the-costing-jour|costing assessment of Resource Consumption Accounting]&lt;/ref&gt;

ROSA is classified as a non-web open-source application, bringing many of the key modeling techniques of the RCA model to life.  It provides a hands-on approach allowing the user complete interactive modeling capabilities. All the necessary files (databases, applications, manuals, storyboard etc.) as outlined in the bullet points below, have been collected into one compressed downloadable zip folder. The application uses [[Microsoft Excel]] as its primary interface, thus the learning curve is greatly accelerated due to the familiarity factor.

==Purpose of ROSA Project==
In 2009, it was determined that a hands-on RCA model would be an effective way to demonstrate how RCA works. The ROSA application answers this need, and was designed as an interactive tool to aid in better understanding the principles and costing approach of [[resource consumption accounting]]. ROSA should be viewed as a ''cost planning and analysis tool'' and not as a ''pricing/profitability application''.

The ROSA open-source package contains:
*''ROSA manual'' – To start the install process, double-click Autorun (Application) in the ROSA_USB compressed zip folder.
*''Palo For Excel installation file''
*''ROSA base model database'' (pre-configured model)
*''ROSA sample database'' (blank model)
*''Excel application file''
*''Visual Storyboard''
Note: The Palo BI Suite support material should be used in conjunction with the ROSA Manual where necessary, particularly in areas concerning Palo installation, set-up and operation.

==Features==
[[Image:ROSAfront.jpg|thumb|right|525px|''ROSA Copyright 2010 Alta Via Consulting, LLC'']]
ROSA uses the business intelligence (BI) application called [[Palo (OLAP database)|Palo]]. Palo allows the ROSA base model database to be pre-configured so that the user can explore the look and feel of how a RCA model functions.
{{Wikibooks|RCA Open Source Application: ROSA Manual}}

Some of the primary features of the RCA open-source application are:

*RCA modeling
**cost objects in an RCA model
**planning a cost object's output and primary costs
**relationships in an RCA model
**storyboard of a pharmaceutical company
*Analysis of
**product costs
**resource pools and business processes
**fixed and proportional rates
*Maintaining
**resource pools and business processes
**products
**primary costs
**secondary costs (internal consumption)
**capacity
**rate calculation
*Configuring
**importing of master data and planning data values

==Limitations==
There are certain cost modeling limitations inherent in the ROSA application. These limitations are specific to Version 1.0 of the ROSA application and should not be viewed as static. In other cases, customized versions of ROSA have been developed to fulfill client-specific requests addressing their firm’s individual costing requirements.

*''No ‘actual’ costs'' – ROSA is a stand-alone application and does not have integrated links to import data. It supports the construction of an RCA model for cost planning and analysis. ROSA does not currently support the comparison of actual to plan within the application.  The planning aspect allows for the definition of consumption relationships with operational resource quantities, valuing the resource quantities with dollars, and calculating product and service costs.
*''Excess/idle capacity'' – There is a limited ability to isolate excess/idle capacity in the application. The application currently deals only with planned information and is therefore not able to provide information on actual excess/idle capacity.
*''Model size limitation'' – The ROSA model was designed for optimum use for businesses with limited size RCA applications.  However, the underlying database and technology used in this model is extremely scalable.
*''No profitability reporting'' –  Rosa Version 1.0 is solely for the purposes of cost modeling. Customer or product revenue cannot be accommodated in this Version 1.0 of the application and reports on customer or product profitability are not provided.

To experience the full benefits that [[Resource Consumption Accounting]] has to offer as a dynamic, fully integrated, principle-based approach, a more robust and integrated software application must be used. The most widely used software applications for RCA are [[SAP AG]] ERP system and macs Controlling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10185">[[File:Telephone operators, 1952.jpg|thumb|[[Seattle]] telephone operators in a [[private branch exchange]] in 1952.]]
In the early days of telephony, through roughly the 1960s, companies used manual [[telephone switchboard]]s, and '''switchboard operators''' connected calls by inserting a pair of [[Phone connector (audio)|phone plug]]s into the appropriate jacks.

==Description==
Each pair of plugs was part of a [[cord circuit]] with a switch associated that let the operator participate in the call. Each jack had a light above it that lit when the telephone receiver was lifted (the earliest systems required a generator on the phone to be cranked by hand). Lines from the central office were usually arranged along the bottom row. Before the advent of operator distance dialing and customer [[direct distance dialing|direct dial]] (DDD) calling, switchboard operators would work with their counterparts in the distant central office to complete [[long distance call]]s. With the development of [[Stored Program Control exchange|computerized]] telephone dialing systems, many [[telephone call]]s which previously required a live operator can be placed automatically by the [[calling party]] without additional human intervention. Switchboard operators are typically required to have very strong communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;Principles of Hotel Front Office Operations - Page 55, Sue Baker, Pam Bradley, Jeremy Huyton - 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan Civil Service Exams - Page xii, Kaplan - 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the advent of [[telephone exchange|automatic exchanges]], an operator's assistance was required for anything other than calling telephones across a shared [[Party line (telephony)|party line]]. Callers spoke to an operator at a Central Office who then connected a cord to the proper circuit in order to complete the call. Being in complete control of the call, the operator was in a position to listen to private conversations. Automatic, or Dial systems were developed in the 1920s to reduce labor costs as usage increased, and to ensure privacy to the customer. As phone systems became more sophisticated, less direct intervention by the telephone operator was necessary to complete calls.

As well as the people that were employed by the public networks, operators were required at [[private branch exchange]]s to answer incoming [[telephone call]]s and connect them to the correct [[extension (telephone)|extension]]. Today, most large organizations have direct-dial extensions.  Smaller workplaces may have an automated system which allows callers to enter the extension of the called party, or a [[receptionist]] who answers calls and performs operator duties.  Depending on the employment setting, the roles and level of responsibilities of a PBX operator can vary greatly, from performing [[Wake-up call (service)|wake-up calls]] in a hotel to coordinating emergency responses, dispatching, and overhead paging in hospitals. Operators employed in healthcare settings have other duties, such as [[data entry clerk|data entry]], [[Receptionist|greeting patients]] and visitors, taking messages, triaging, or acting as an after hours [[answering service]]. Experienced, well-trained operators generally command a higher salary.

In January 1878 George Willard Croy became the world's first telephone operator when he started working for the Boston Telephone Dispatch company.&lt;ref name="Google Books"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b2mMzS0hCkAC&amp;pg=PA696&amp;lpg=PA696&amp;dq=%22emma+nutt%22+telephone+operator&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kKYQAmoXhW&amp;sig=GEOi4yd-4NQnw3T4cb2mtOkBNRY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3bKTSo_9DqOZjAf496HzDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=%22emma%20nutt%22%20telephone%20operator&amp;f=false|title=The Telecommunications Illustrated Dictionary, Second Edition|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Telephone Operator.png|thumb|right|United States phone operator in 1911.]]
[[Emma Nutt]] became the first female telephone operator on 1 September 1878 when she started working for the Boston Telephone Dispatch company, because the attitude and behaviour of the teenage boys previously employed as operators was unacceptable.&lt;ref name="ATT 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=4800&amp;cdvn=news&amp;newsarticleid=20902|title=AT&amp;T Press Release Headlines &amp; News from AT&amp;T|work=att.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emma was hired by [[Alexander Graham Bell]],&lt;ref name="Google Books"/&gt; and reportedly, could remember every number in the telephone directory of the [[New England Telephone and Telegraph Company|New England Telephone Company]].&lt;ref name="Google Books"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ATT 1"/&gt; More women began to replace men within this sector of the workforce for several reasons. The companies observed that women were generally more courteous to callers, and women's labor was cheap in comparison to men's. Specifically, women were paid from one half to one quarter of a man's salary.&lt;ref name="Rakow 207–225"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rakow|first=Lana|title=Women and the Telephone: The Gendering of a Communications Technology|pages=207–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women of the Signal Corps Female Telephone Operators Unit, American bilingual female switchboard operators in [[World War I]], were known colloquially as [[Hello Girls]] and were not formally recognized for their military service until 1978.

[[Julia O'Connor]], a former telephone operator, led the Telephone Operators' Strike of 1919 and the Telephone Operators' Strike of 1923 against [[Verizon New England|New England Telephone Company]] on behalf of the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers|IBEW]] Telephone Operators' Department for better wages and working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Norwood |first=Stephen H. |title=Labor's Flaming Youth: Telephone Operators and Worker Militancy, 1878-1923 |place=Urbana and Chicago, IL |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpJAAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Labor's+Flaming+Youth&amp;dq=Labor's+Flaming+Youth&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9nWnTeDUNMPAswaB5KiQCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA |pages=180–193|isbn=0-252-01633-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Telephone Strike Won by Workers | work= New York Times, April 21, 1919 | url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/04/21/118147542.pdf | accessdate= 2011-04-17 | date=April 21, 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norwood, ''Labor's Flaming Youth'', pp. 262-291&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1919 strike, after five days, Postmaster General Burleson agreed to negotiate an agreement between the union and the telephone company, resulting in an increase in pay for the operators and recognition of the right to bargain collectively.&lt;ref&gt;Norwood, ''Labor's Flaming Youth'', pp. 180-193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Telephone Strike Won by Workers | work= New York Times, April 21, 1919 | url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/04/21/118147542.pdf | accessdate= 2011-04-17 | date=April 21, 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 1923 strike was called off after less than a month without achieving any of its goals.&lt;ref&gt;Norwood, ''Labor's Flaming Youth'', pp. 262-291&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, any switchboard operator employed by an independently owned public telephone company which had not more than seven hundred and fifty stations was excluded from the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]].

'''''The Pursuit of Happyness''''' is a 2006 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] based on entrepreneur [[Chris Gardner]]'s nearly one-year struggle being homeless. Directed by [[Gabriele Muccino]], the film features [[Will Smith]] as Gardner, a homeless salesman. Smith's son [[Jaden Smith]] co-stars, making his film debut as Gardner's son, Christopher Jr.

The screenplay by [[Steven Conrad]] is based on the best-selling [[memoir]] of the same name written by Gardner with [[Quincy Troupe]]. The film was released on December 15, 2006 by [[Columbia Pictures]]. For his performance, Smith was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] and a [[Golden Globe]] for Best Actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/will-smith-oscars-diversity-protest-nominations-1201684878/|title=Will Smith Says He Won’t Attend Oscars|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=2016-01-21|work=Variety|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unusual [[spelling]] of the film's title comes from a [[mural]] that Gardner sees on the wall outside the daycare facility his son attends. He complains to the owner of the daycare that "happiness" is incorrectly spelled  as "happyness" and needs to be changed.

== Plot ==
In 1981, San Francisco salesman Chris Gardner invests his entire life savings in portable [[bone density]] scanners, which he demonstrates to doctors and pitches as a handy [[Paradigm shift|quantum leap]] over standard [[X-ray]]s. The scanners play a vital role in his life. While he is able to sell most of them, the time lag between the sales and his growing financial demands enrage his already bitter and alienated wife Linda, who works as a hotel maid. The financial instability increasingly erodes their marriage, in spite of them caring for Christopher Jr., their soon-to-be five-year-old son.

While Gardner is trying to sell one of the scanners, he meets Jay Twistle, a manager for [[Dean Witter Reynolds]], and impresses him by solving a [[Rubik's Cube]] during a taxi ride. After Jay leaves, Gardner lacks money to pay the fare and chooses to run instead, causing the driver to angrily chase him into a [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] station. Gardner boards a train but loses one of his scanners in the process. His new relationship with Jay earns him the chance to become an intern stockbroker. The day before the interview, Gardner grudgingly agrees to paint his apartment so as to postpone [[eviction|being evicted]] due to his difficulty in paying the rent. While painting, Gardner is greeted by two policemen at his doorstep, who take him to the station, stating he has to pay for the numerous parking tickets he has accumulated. As part of the sanction, Gardner is ordered to spend the night in jail instead, complicating his schedule for the interview the next morning. He manages to arrive at Dean Witter's office on time, albeit still in his shabby clothes. Despite his appearance, he impresses the interviewers and lands an unpaid internship. He would be among 20 interns competing for a paid position as a stockbroker.

Gardner's unpaid internship does not please Linda, who eventually leaves for New York because she might get a job at her sister's boyfriend's new restaurant. After Gardner bluntly says she is incapable of being a single mom, she agrees that Christopher Jr. will remain with his dad. Gardner is further set back when his bank account is [[garnishment|garnished]] by the [[IRS]] for unpaid income taxes, and he and Christopher are evicted. He ends up with less than $22, resulting in them being homeless, and they are forced at one point to stay in a restroom at a BART station. Other days, he and Christopher spend nights at a [[homeless shelter]], in BART, or, if he manages to procure sufficient cash, at a hotel. Later, Gardner finds the bone scanner that he lost in the BART station earlier and, after repairing it, sells it to a physician, thus completing all his sales of his scanners.

Disadvantaged by his limited work hours, and knowing that maximizing his client contacts and profits is the only way to earn the broker position, Gardner develops a number of ways to make phone sales calls more efficiently, including reaching out to potential high-value customers, defying protocol. One sympathetic prospect who is a top-level pension fund manager even takes Chris and Christopher to a [[San Francisco 49ers]] game. Regardless of his challenges, he never reveals his lowly circumstances to his colleagues, even going so far as to lend one of his bosses $5 for cab fare, a sum that he cannot afford. Concluding his internship, Gardner is called into a meeting with his managers. One of them notes he is wearing a new shirt. Gardner explains it is his last day and thought to dress for the occasion. The manager smiles and says he should wear another new one tomorrow, letting him know that he has won the coveted full-time position and giving him back his $5 as he promised. Fighting back tears, Gardner shakes hands with them, then rushes to his son's daycare to embrace Christopher. They walk down the street, joking with each other (and are passed by the real Chris Gardner, in a business suit). The epilogue reveals that Gardner went on to form his own multimillion-dollar brokerage firm.

== Production ==
[[File:Chrisgardner.jpg|thumb|The film is based on the story of [[Chris Gardner]]'s struggle with homelessness.]]

=== Development ===
[[Chris Gardner]] realized his story had [[Hollywood]] potential after an overwhelming national response to an interview he did with ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'' in January 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=There’s a Way—and Maybe a Will—for Gardner Story |last=Zwecker |first=Bill |date=July 17, 2003 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published his autobiography on May 23, 2006, and later became an associate producer for the film. The movie took some liberties with Gardner's true life story. Certain details and events that actually took place over the span of several years were compressed into a relatively short time and although eight-year-old Jaden portrayed Chris as a five-year-old, Gardner's son was just a toddler at the time. Towards the end Chris Gardner has a brief uncredited cameo appearance before the credits.

=== Casting ===
Chris Gardner initially thought Smith, an actor best known for his performances in blockbuster films, was miscast to play him. However, he claimed his daughter Jacintha said, "If [Smith] can play [[Muhammad Ali]], he can play you!", referring to Smith's role in the biopic ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]'' (2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.contactmusic.net/will-smith/news/smiths-real-life-role-model-unimpressed-with-his-stardom_1016502 |title=Smith&amp;#039;s Real Life Role Model Unimpressed With His Stardom |date=December 14, 2006 |work=[[Contactmusic.com]] |access-date=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Music ===
[[Varèse Sarabande]] released a soundtrack album with the score composed by [[Andrea Guerra (composer)|Andrea Guerra]] on January 9, 2007.

Also in the film are brief portions of "[[Higher Ground (Stevie Wonder song)|Higher Ground]]" and "[[Jesus Children of America]]", both sung by [[Stevie Wonder]], and
"Lord, Don't Move the Mountain" by [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[Doris Akers]], sung by the [[Glide Memorial Church|Glide Ensemble]].

== Release ==

=== Box office ===
The film debuted first at the [[North America]]n box office, earning $27 million during its opening weekend and beating out heavily promoted films such as ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'' and ''[[Charlotte's Web (2006 film)|Charlotte's Web]]''. It was Smith's sixth consecutive #1 opening and one of Smith's consecutive $100 million blockbusters. The film grossed $162,586,036 domestically in the US and Canada. In the hope Gardner's story would inspire the down-trodden citizens of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] to achieve financial independence and to take greater responsibility for the welfare of their families, the mayor of Chattanooga organized a viewing of the film for the city's homeless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

"When I talk about alcoholism in the household, domestic violence, child abuse, illiteracy, and all of those issues—those are universal issues; those are not just confined to [[ZIP code]]s," he said.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news | last =Gandossy | first =Taylor | title =From sleeping on the streets to Wall Street | publisher =[[CNN]] |date=January 16, 1222 | url =http://edition.cnn.com/2006/US/12/15/paycheckaway.gardner/index.html | accessdate = July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Home media ===
The film was released on [[DVD]] on March 27, 2007, and as of November 2007, US [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] DVD sales accounted for an additional $89,923,088 in revenue, slightly less than half of what was earned in its first week of release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2006/PRHAP.php |title='&amp;#39;The Pursuit of Happyness'&amp;#39; at TheNumbers.com |publisher=The-numbers.com |date= |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 5,570,577 units have been sold, bringing in $90,582,602 in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2006/PRHAP-DVD.php |title=The Pursuit of Happyness – DVD Sales |publisher=The Numbers |date= |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
The film was received generally positively by critics, with Will Smith receiving widespread acclaim for his performance. Film review site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calculated a 67% overall approval based on 173 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Will Smith's heartfelt performance elevates ''The Pursuit of Happyness'' above mere melodrama."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pursuit_of_happyness/ | title = The Pursuit of Happyness Movie Reviews, Pictures| publisher= Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', [[Mick LaSalle]] observed, "The great surprise of the picture is that it's not corny ... The beauty of the film is its honesty. In its outlines, it's nothing like the usual success story depicted on-screen, in which, after a reasonable interval of disappointment, success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead, this success story follows the pattern most common in life—it chronicles a series of soul-sickening failures and defeats, missed opportunities, sure things that didn't quite happen, all of which are accompanied by a concomitant accretion of barely perceptible victories that gradually amount to something. In other words, it all feels real."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mick LaSalle, Chronicle Movie Critic |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/15/DDGR7MV3611.DTL |title='&amp;#39;San Francisco Chronicle'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=December 15, 2006 |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manohla Dargis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "a [[fairy tale]] in [[Realism (arts)|realist]] [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] ... the kind of entertainment that goes down smoothly until it gets stuck in your [[Crop (anatomy)|craw]] ... It's the same old bootstraps story, an American dream artfully told, skillfully sold. To that calculated end, the film making is seamless, unadorned, transparent, the better to serve Mr. Smith's warm expressiveness ... How you respond to this man's moving story may depend on whether you find Mr. Smith's and his son's performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dargis |first=Manohla |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/12/15/movies/15happ.html |title='&amp;#39;New York Times'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date=December 15, 2006 |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' awarded the film three out of a possible four stars and commented, "Smith is on the march toward Oscar ... [His] role needs gravity, smarts, charm, humor and a soul that's not synthetic. Smith brings it. He's the real deal."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/pursuit-of-happyness-20061212 ''Rolling Stone'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Brian Lowry said the film "is more inspirational than creatively inspired—imbued with the kind of uplifting, afterschool-special qualities that can trigger a major toothache ... Smith's heartfelt performance is easy to admire. But the movie's painfully earnest tone should skew its appeal to the portion of the audience that, admittedly, has catapulted many cloying TV movies into hits ... In the final accounting, [it] winds up being a little like the determined salesman Mr. Gardner himself: easy to root for, certainly, but not that much fun to spend time with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowry |first=Brian |url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_review/VE1117932267.html?nav=reviews07&amp;categoryid=2352&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 |title='&amp;#39;Variety'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Variety.com |date=December 7, 2006 |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Crust of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated, "Dramatically it lacks the layering of a ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'', which it superficially resembles ... Though the subject matter is serious, the film itself is rather slight, and it relies on the actor to give it any energy. Even in a more modest register, Smith is a very appealing leading man, and he makes Gardner's plight compelling ... ''The Pursuit of Happyness '' is an unexceptional film with exceptional performances ... There are worse ways to spend the holidays, and, at the least, it will likely make you appreciate your own circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boucher |first=Geoff |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/cl-et-pursuit15dec15,0,1752143.story |title='&amp;#39;Los Angeles Times'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Calendarlive.com |date=January 26, 2011 |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', Steve Persall graded the film B- and added, "[It] is the obligatory feel-good drama of the holiday season and takes that responsibility a bit too seriously ... the film lays so many obstacles and solutions before its resilient hero that the volume of sentimentality and coincidence makes it feel suspect ... Neither Conrad's script nor Muccino's redundant direction shows [what] lifted the real-life Chris above better educated and more experienced candidates, but it comes through in the earnest performances of the two Smiths. Father Will seldom comes across this mature on screen; at the finale, he achieves a measure of Oscar-worthy emotion. Little Jaden is a chip off the old block, uncommonly at ease before the cameras. Their real-life bond is an inestimable asset to the on-screen characters' relationship, although Conrad never really tests it with any conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/12/14/Weekend/_Happyness__takes_it_.shtml |title='&amp;#39;St. Petersburg Times'&amp;#39; review |publisher=Sptimes.com |date= |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[National Review Online]]'' has named the film #7 in its list of 'The Best Conservative Movies'. [[Linda Chavez]] of the [[Center for Equal Opportunity]] wrote, "this film provides the perfect antidote to Wall Street and other Hollywood diatribes depicting the world of finance as filled with nothing but greed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Miller |first=John |title=The Best Conservative Movies |publisher=[[National Review Online]] |date=February 23, 2009 |url=http://nrd.nationalreview.com/article/?q=YWQ4MDlhMWRkZDQ5YmViMDM1Yzc0MTE3ZTllY2E3MGM= |accessdate=August 19, 2009 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The '''Turin International Book Fair''' (''Italian: Salone Internazionale del Libro'') is [[Italy]]'s largest [[trade fair]] for books, held annually in mid-May in [[Turin]], Italy.

Founded in 1988 as ''Book showroom'' (''Italian: Salone del libro''), it is the largest book fair in [[Europe]], involving more than 1,400 exhibitors and 341,000 visitors in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wuz.it/Home/AnsaNews/tabid/65/newsid/31237/Default.aspx Fiera del libro: 300.000 visitatori&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It was founded in 1988 with the name ''Salone del Libro'' by the entrepreneur Guido Accornero and the bookseller Angelo Pezzana. The opening ceremony was held on May 18, 1988, at the opera house [[Teatro Regio di Torino|Teatro Regio]], with the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]] [[Joseph Brodsky]].

It has been held first at [[Torino Esposizioni]] and then, since 1992, at [[Lingotto|Lingotto Fiere]].

From 1999 to 2009, because of disagreements with owner of the trade name ''Salone del Libro'', the organization changed its name to ''Fiera del Libro'' (from 2002, ''Fiera Internazionale del Libro''). Since 2010 it is called again ''Salone Internazionale del Libro''.

From 1999 to 2016 the director has been the Italian writer Ernesto Ferrero, winner of the [[Strega Prize]] in 2000 with the novel ''N.''

From October, 2016, the director is the Italian writer [[Nicola Lagioia]], also winner of the [[Strega Prize]] in 2015 with the novel ''La ferocia'' (a.k.a. "''The ferocity''").

== Guest of honour ==
Every year a ''guest of honor'' is named for the fair. A special exhibition hall is set up for the guest country, and the major publishing houses are present at the fair.

It was founded by Swiss traders that were affiliated with both Basel Trading Company and the [[Basel Mission]] and who wanted portions of their earnings to support the works of the mission.&lt;ref name="jones" /&gt; The traders already had business interest in India and Ghana prior to entering the Nigerian  market.
