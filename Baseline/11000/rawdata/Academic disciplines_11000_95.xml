      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8300">[[File:Arch Sculpt - CA 09.jpg|thumb|350px|right|sculpted [[pediment]]]]'''Architectural sculpture''' is the use of [[sculpture|sculptural]] techniques by an [[architect]] and/or [[sculptor]] in the design of a building, [[bridge]], [[mausoleum]] or other such project. The sculpture is usually integrated with the structure, but freestanding works that are part of the original design are also considered to be architectural sculpture.

It has also been defined as, ''an integral part of a building or sculpture created especially to decorate or embellish an architectural structure.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selectartusa.com/gloss.htm|title=Select Art Sculpture: Glossary|work=selectartusa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural sculpture has been employed by builders throughout history, and in virtually every continent on earth save pre-colonial Australia.

==Egyptian==
{{main article|Ancient Egyptian architecture}}
[[File:LuxTempleObelisk.JPG|left|200px|thumb|[[Luxor Obelisk]]]]
Modern understanding of ancient Egyptian architecture is based mainly on the religious monuments that have survived since antiquity, which are carved stone with post-and-lintel construction. These religious monuments dedicated to the gods or [[pharaoh]]s were designed with a great deal of architectural sculpture inside and out:  engaged statues, carved columns and pillars, and wall surfaces carved with bas-reliefs. The classic examples of Egyptian colossal monuments (the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]], the [[Abu Simbel temples]], the [[Karnak]] Temple Complex, etc.) represent thoroughly integrated combinations of architecture and sculpture.

Obelisks, elaborately carved from a single block of stone, were usually placed in pairs to flank the entrances to temples and pyramids. Reliefs are also common in Egyptian building, depicting scenes of everyday life and often accompanied by [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]].

==Assyro-Babylonian==
[[File:Ashurnasipal with official.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Ashurnasipal with officials]]
The [[Fertile Crescent]] architectural sculptural tradition began when [[Ashurnasirpal II]] moved his capitol to the city of [[Nimrud]] around 879 BCE.  This site was located near a major deposit of gypsum ([[alabaster]]).  This fairly easy to cut stone could be quarried in large blocks that allowed them to be easily carved for the palaces that were built there.  The early style developed out of an already flourishing mural tradition by creating drawings that were then carved in low relief.&lt;ref&gt;Reade, Julian, ''Assyrian Sculpture'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts,  1983 pp. 17-21&lt;/ref&gt;  Another contributing factor in the development of architectural sculpture were the small carved seals that had been made in the area for centuries.

Classical Greek architecture, like the prototypical [[Parthenon]], incorporate architectural sculpture in a fairly narrow set of standard, formal building elements.  The names of these elements still comprise the usual vocabulary for discussion:  the [[pediment]], the [[Metope (architecture)|metope]], the [[frieze]], the [[caryatid]], the [[quadriga]], [[acroteria]], etc.

Greek examples of architectural sculpture are distinguished not only by their age but their very high quality and skillful technique, with rhythmic and dynamic modeling, figural compositions in friezes that continue seamlessly over vertical joints from one block of stone to the next, and mastery of depth and legibility.

The known Greek and Roman examples have been exhaustively studied, and frequently copied or adapted into subsequent neo-classical styles:  [[Greek Revival architecture]], usually the most strict; [[Neoclassical architecture]]; [[Beaux-Arts architecture]] with its exaggerated and romantic free interpretations of the vocabulary, and even Stalinist neo-classical architecture like the [[Central Moscow Hippodrome]] adapted to a totalitarian aesthetic.  These re-interpretations are sometimes dubious, for instance, there are many modern copies of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]], like the [[National Diet Building]] in Tokyo, despite the fact that all classical descriptions of the Mausoleum are vague.

[[File:Pediment, Philly Art Museum (3).jpg|right|250px|thumb|pediment sculpture detail, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], sculptor [[C. Paul Jennewein]], 1933]]

Not until about 1870 did the U.S. develop the talent, the economic power, and the taste for buildings grand enough to need architectural sculpture.  The [[Philadelphia City Hall]], constructed 1871 through 1901, is recognized as the turning point,&lt;ref&gt;Gurney, George, Sculpture of a City—Philadelphia's Treasures in Bronze and Stone, Fairmount Park Association, Walker Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; because of the approximately 250 sculptures planned for the building, the large [[finial]] of [[William Penn]], and the practical effect of [[Alexander Milne Calder]] training many assistants there.

In the same years, [[H.H. Richardson]] began to develop his influential signature genre, which included romantic, medieval, and Romanesque stone carving.  [[Richard Morris Hunt]] became the first to bring the Parisian neo-classical [[École des Beaux-Arts]] style back to the United States, a style that depended on integrated figural sculpture and a highly ornamented building fabric for its aesthetic effect.  The Beaux-Arts style dominated for major public buildings between the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, through about 1912, the year of the [[San Francisco City Hall]].  The need for sculptors saw the emergence of a small industry of carvers and modelers, and a professional organization, the [[National Sculpture Society]].

The advent of steel frames and reinforced concrete encouraged, at first, more diverse building styles into the 1910s and 1920s.  The diversity of skyscraper Gothic, exotic "revivals" of Mayan and Egyptian, [[Stripped Classicism]], [[Art Deco]], etc. called for a similar diversity of sculptural approaches.  The use of sculpture was still expected, particularly for public buildings such as war memorials and museums.  In 1926 the pre-eminent American architectural sculptor, [[Lee Lawrie]], with his longtime friend and collaborator architect [[Bertram Goodhue]], developed perhaps the most sophisticated American examples at the [[Nebraska State Capitol]] and the [[Los Angeles Public Library]].

Goodhue's premature death ended that collaboration.  The [[Great Depression|Depression]], and the onset of World War II, decimated building activity.  The old building trades disbanded.  By the postwar years the aesthetic of architectural modernism had taken hold.  Except for a few diehards and regional sculptors, the profession was not only dead but discredited.  As of 2010 there are isolated signs of a revival of interest, for instance in the career of [[Raymond Kaskey]].

'''Artificial muscle''' is a generic term used for actuators, materials or devices that mimic natural [[muscle]] and can reversibly contract, expand, or rotate within one component due to an external stimulus (such as voltage, current, pressure or temperature).&lt;ref name="Mirvakili2013"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=M.A.Sc |first=Seyed M. |last=Mirvakili |title=Niobium Nanowire Yarns and Their Application as Artificial Muscle |publisher=[[University of British Columbia]] |date=2013 | url=http://hdl.handle.net/2429/44257|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three basic actuation responses – contraction, expansion, and rotation – can be combined together within a single component to produce other types of motions (e.g. bending, by contracting one side of the material while expanding the other side). Conventional motors and [[pneumatic]] linear or rotary actuators do not qualify as artificial muscles, because there is more than one component involved in the actuation.

Due to their high flexibility, versatility and power-to-weight ratio compared with traditional rigid actuators, artificial muscles have the potential to be a highly disruptive [[emerging technology]]. Though currently in limited use, the technology may have wide future applications in industry, medicine, robotics and many other fields.&lt;ref name=MuscleApps/&gt;&lt;ref name=Apps2/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirvakili2018"&gt;{{cite journal

|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with natural muscles==
While there is no general theory that allows for actuators to be compared, there are "power criteria" for artificial muscle technologies that allow for specification of new actuator technologies in comparison with natural muscular properties. In summary, the criteria include [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]], [[Strain (materials science)|strain]], [[strain rate]], cycle life, and [[elastic modulus]]. Some authors have considered other criteria (Huber et al., 1997), such as actuator density and strain resolution.&lt;ref name="Tondu2007"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Artificial Muscles for Humanoid Robots, Humanoid Robots, Human-like Machines |chapter-url=http://www.intechopen.com/download/pdf/163 |first=Bertrand |last=Tondu |pages=89–122 |title=Humanoid Robots: Human-like Machines |editor-first=Matthias |editor-last=Hackel |publisher=InTech |year=2007 |isbn=978-3-902613-07-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the most powerful artificial muscle fibers in existence can offer a hundredfold increase in power over equivalent lengths of natural muscle fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/scientists-just-created-some-of-the-most-powerful-muscl-1526957560|title=Scientists just created some of the most powerful muscles in existence|publisher=[[io9]]|date=20 February 2014|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers measure the speed, [[energy density]], power, and efficiency of artificial muscles; no one type of artificial muscle is the best in all areas.&lt;ref name="Herkewitz"/&gt;

==Types==
Artificial muscles can be divided into three major groups based on their actuation mechanism.&lt;ref name="Mirvakili2013"/&gt;

===Electric field actuation===
{{main|Electroactive polymers}}
Electroactive polymers (EAPs) are polymers that can be actuated through the application of electric fields. Currently, the most prominent EAPs include piezoelectric polymers, dielectric actuators (DEAs), electrostrictive graft [[elastomers]], [[liquid crystal]] elastomers (LCE) and ferroelectric polymers. While these EAPs can be made to bend, their low capacities for torque motion currently limit their usefulness as artificial muscles. Moreover, without an accepted standard material for creating EAP devices, commercialization has remained impractical. However, significant progress has been made in EAP technology since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Yoseph|title=Electroactive Polymers (EAPs)|url=http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-p02-elact-pol.htm|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ion-based actuation====
Ionic EAPs are polymers that can be actuated through the diffusion of ions in an electrolyte solution (in addition to the application of electric fields). Current examples of ionic electroactive polymers include polyelectrode gels, ionomeric polymer metallic composites (IPMC), conductive polymers and electrorheological fluids (ERF). In 2011, it was demonstrated that twisted [[carbon nanotube]]s could also be actuated by applying an electric field.&lt;ref name="Foroughi2011"&gt;{{cite journal
 | author= Foroughi, J.| title= Torsional Carbon Nanotube Artificial Muscles
 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]
 | date=2011 | volume=334 | issue= 6055 | pages= 494–497
 | doi = 10.1126/science.1211220
|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric power actuation===
Twisted and coiled [[polymer]] (TCP) muscles also known as supercoiled polymer (SCP) are coiled polymer that can be actuated by [[electric power]] &lt;ref name="TCP muscle"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarzadeh |first1=Mohsen |last2=Gans |first2=Nicholas |last3=Tadesse |first3=Yonas |title=Control of TCP muscles using Takagi–Sugeno–Kang fuzzy inference system |journal=Mechatronics |date=August 2018 |volume=53 |page= |pages=124–139 |doi=10.1016/j.mechatronics.2018.06.007 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957415818300965}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A TCP muscle look like a [[Helix|helical]] [[Spring (device)|spring]]. TCP muscles are usually made from [[silver]] coated [[Nylon]]. TCP muscle can also made from other [[Electrical resistance and conductance|electrical conductance]] coat such as gold. TCP muscles should be under a load to keep the muscle extended. The electrical energy transforms to thermal energy due to electrical resistance, which also known as [[Joule heating]], Ohmic heating, and resistive heating. As the temperature of the TCP muscle increases by Joule heating, the polymer contracts and it causes the muscle contraction. &lt;ref name="TCP muscle"/&gt;.

===Pneumatic actuation===
{{main|Pneumatic artificial muscles}}
Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) operate by filling a pneumatic bladder with pressurized air. Upon applying gas pressure to the bladder, isotropic volume expansion occurs, but is confined by braided wires that encircle the bladder, translating the volume expansion to a linear contraction along the axis of the actuator. PAMs can be classified by their operation and design; namely, PAMs feature pneumatic or hydraulic operation, overpressure or underpressure operation, braided/netted or embedded membranes and stretching membranes or rearranging membranes. Among the most commonly used PAMs today is a cylindrically braided muscle known as the McKibben Muscle, which was first developed by J. L. McKibben in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brl.ee.washington.edu/BRL_Pubs/Pdfs/Th024.pdf|title=Artificial Muscles: Actuators for Biorobotic Systems|date=1999|publisher=University of Washington|format=PDF|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal actuation===

====Fishing line====
Artificial muscles constructed from ordinary [[fishing line]] and sewing thread can lift 100 times more weight and generate 100 times more power than a human muscle of the same length and weight.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial muscles based on fishing line already cost orders of magnitude less (per pound) than shape-memory alloy or carbon nanotube yarn; but currently have relatively poor efficiency.&lt;ref name="Herkewitz"&gt;
William Herkewitz.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual [[macromolecule]]s are aligned with the fiber in commercially available [[polymer]] fibers. By winding them into coils, researchers make artificial muscles that contract at speeds similar to human muscles.&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A (untwisted) polymer fiber, such as polyethelene fishing line or nylon sewing thread, unlike most materials, shortens when heated—up to about 4% for a 250 K increase in temperature. By twisting the fiber and winding the twisted fiber into a coil,

One application of thermally-activated artificial muscles is to automatically open and close windows, responding to temperature without using any power.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;

Tiny artificial muscles composed of twisted [[carbon nanotube]]s filled with [[paraffin wax|paraffin]] are 200 times stronger than human muscle.&lt;ref&gt;

====Shape-memory alloys====
{{main|Shape-memory alloy}}
Shape-memory alloys (SMAs), liquid crystalline elastomers, and metallic alloys that can be deformed and then returned to their original shape when exposed to heat, can function as artificial muscles. Thermal actuator-based artificial muscles offer heat resistance, impact resistance, low density, high fatigue strength, and large force generation during shape changes. In 2012, a new class of electric field-activated, [[electrolyte]]-free artificial muscles called "twisted yarn actuators" were demonstrated, based on the thermal expansion of a secondary material within the muscle's conductive twisted structure.&lt;ref name="Mirvakili2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lima2012"&gt;{{cite journal

==Control systems==
{{main|Control theory}}
The three types of artificial muscles have different constraints that affect the type of control system they require for actuation. It is important to note, however, that control systems are often designed to meet the specifications of a given experiment, with some experiments calling for the combined use of a variety of different actuators or a hybrid control schema. As such, the following examples should not be treated as an exhaustive list of the variety of control systems that may be employed to actuate a given artificial muscle.

===Voltage control===
The twisted and coiled polymer (TCP) muscles can be modeled by [[first-order]] [[Linear time-invariant theory|linear time-invariant]] [[State-space representation|state spaces]] when input is electrical voltage, with accuracy more than 85%. Therefore, A TCP muscles can be easily controlled by a digital [[PID controller]]&lt;ref name="TCP muscle"/&gt;. A fuzzy controller can be used to speed up the PID controller &lt;ref name="TCP muscle"/&gt;.

===EAP control===
EAPs offer lower weight, faster response, higher power density and quieter operation when compared to traditional actuators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mavroidis|first=Constantinos|title=Nonlinear Force Control of Dielectric Electroactive Polymer Actuators|url=http://www.coe.neu.edu/Research/robots/papers/SPIE2010_2.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both electric and ionic EAPs are primarily actuated using feedback control loops, better known as closed-loop control systems.&lt;ref&gt;Baohua Qi ; Wen Lu and Benjamin R. Mattes

===Pneumatic control===
Currently there are two types of pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs). The first type has a single bladder surrounded by a braided sleeve and the second type has a double bladder.

====Single bladder surrounded by a braided sleeve====
Pneumatic artificial muscles, while lightweight and inexpensive, pose a particularly difficult control problem as they are both highly nonlinear and have properties, such as temperature, that fluctuate significantly over time. PAMs generally consist of rubber and plastic components. As these parts come into contact with each other during actuation, the PAM's temperature increases, ultimately leading to permanent changes in the structure of the artificial muscle over time. This problem has led to a variety of experimental approaches. In summary (provided by Ahn et al.), viable experimental control systems include PID control, adaptive control (Lilly, 2003), nonlinear optimal predictive control (Reynolds et al., 2003), variable structure control (Repperger et al., 1998; Medrano-Cerda et al.,1995), gain scheduling (Repperger et al.,1999), and various soft computing approaches including neural network Kohonen training algorithm control (Hesselroth et al.,1994), neural network/nonlinear PID control (Ahn and Thanh, 2005), and neuro-fuzzy/genetic control (Chan et al., 2003; Lilly et al., 2003).

Control problems regarding highly nonlinear systems have generally been addressed through a trial-and-error approach through which "fuzzy models" (Chan et al., 2003) of the system's behavioral capacities could be teased out (from the experimental results of the specific system being tested) by a knowledgeable human expert. However, some research has employed "real data" (Nelles O., 2000) to train up the accuracy of a given fuzzy model while simultaneously avoiding the mathematical complexities of previous models. Ahn et al.'s experiment is simply one example of recent experiments that use modified genetic algorithms (MGAs) to train up fuzzy models using experimental input-output data from a PAM robot arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahn|first=Kyoung|title=Hybrid Control of a Pneumatic Artificial Muscle (PAM) Robot Arm Using an Inverse NARX Fuzzy Model|url=http://www4.hcmut.edu.vn/~hphanh/paper8.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Double bladder====
This actuator consists of an external membrane with an internal flexible membrane dividing the interior of the muscle into two portions. A tendon is secured to the membrane, and exits the muscle through a sleeve so that the tendon can contract into the muscle. A tube allows air into the internal bladder, which then rolls out into the external bladder. A key advantage of this type of pneumatic muscle is that there is no potentially frictive movement of the bladder against an outer sleeve.

===Thermal control===
SMA artificial muscles, while lightweight and useful in applications that require large force and displacement, also present specific control challenges; namely, SMA artificial muscles are limited by their hysteretic input-output relationships and bandwidth limitations. As Wen et al. discuss, the SMA phase transformation phenomenon is "hysteretic" in that the resulting output SMA strand is dependent on the history of its heat input. As for bandwidth limitations, the dynamic response of an SMA actuator during hysteretic phase transformations is very slow due to the amount of time required for the heat to transfer to the SMA artificial muscle. Very little research has been conducted regarding SMA control due to assumptions that regard SMA applications as static devices; nevertheless, a variety of control approaches have been tested to address the control problem of hysteretic nonlinearity.

Generally, this problem has required the application of either open-loop compensation or closed-loop feedback control. Regarding [[open-loop control]], the [[Preisach model]] has often been used for its simple structure and ability for easy simulation and control (Hughes and Wen, 1995). As for [[closed-loop control]], a passivity-based approach analyzing SMA closed loop stability has been used (Madill and Wen, 1994). Wen et al.'s study provides another example of closed-loop feedback control, demonstrating the stability of closed-loop control in SMA applications through applying a combination of force feedback control and position control on a flexible aluminum beam actuated by an SMA made from [[Nitinol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wen|first=John|title=Feedback Control Using Shape Memory Alloy Actuators|url=http://cats-fs.rpi.edu/~wenj/papers/sma_98.pdf|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Artificial muscle technologies have wide potential applications in [[biomimetic]] machines, including robots, industrial actuators and [[powered exoskeleton]]s. EAP-based artificial muscles offer a combination of light weight, low power requirements, resilience and agility for locomotion and manipulation.&lt;ref name=MuscleApps&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ebooks.spiedigitallibrary.org/mobile/content.aspx?bookid=146&amp;sectionid=31570721|title=Electroactive Polymer (EAP) Actuators as Artificial Muscles: Reality, Potential, and Challenges (Second Edition)|chapter=EAP Applications, Potential, and Challenges|editor=Bar-Cohen, Yoseph|date=2004|publisher=SPIE Digital Library|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future EAP devices will have applications in aerospace, automotive industry, medicine, robotics, articulation mechanisms, entertainment, animation, toys, clothing, haptic and tactile interfaces, noise control, transducers, power generators, and smart structures.&lt;ref name=Apps2&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Yoseph|title=Electroactive Polymers (EAP's)|url=http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-p02-elact-pol.htm|publisher=Caltech|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pneumatic artificial muscles also offer greater flexibility, controllability and lightness compared to conventional pneumatic cylinders.&lt;ref name="PAM-Daerden-Lefeber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lucy.vub.ac.be/publications/Daerden_Lefeber_EJMEE.pdf|title=Pneumatic Artificial Muscles: actuators for robotics and automation|format=PDF|author=Frank Daerden|author2=Dirk Lefeber|publisher=[[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], Department of Mechanical Engineering|date=2002|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most PAM applications involve the utilization of McKibben-like muscles.&lt;ref name="PAM-Daerden-Lefeber"/&gt; Thermal actuators such as SMAs have various military, medical, safety, and robotic applications, and could furthermore be used to generate energy through mechanical shape changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lin|first=Richard|title=Shape Memory Alloys|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~richlin1/sma/sma.html|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''blue–white screen''' is a [[Genetic screen|screening technique]] that allows for the rapid and convenient detection of recombinant bacteria in [[Vector DNA|vector]]-based [[molecular cloning]] experiments.  [[DNA]] of interest is ligated into a [[Vector DNA|vector]].  The vector is then [[Transformation (etics)|inserted]] into a [[competent cell|competent host cell]] viable for transformation, which are then grown in the presence of [[X-gal]]. Cells transformed with vectors containing [[recombinant DNA]] will produce white colonies; cells transformed with non-recombinant plasmids (i.e. only the vector) grow into blue colonies. This method of screening is usually performed using a suitable [[bacteria|bacterial strain]], but other organisms such as yeast may also be used.

==Background==
[[Molecular cloning]] is one of the most commonly used procedures in [[molecular biology]].  A gene of interest may be inserted into a plasmid vector via [[DNA ligase|ligation]], and the plasmid is then transformed into ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' cells.  However, not all the plasmids transformed into cells may contain the desired gene insert, and checking each individual colony for the presence of the insert is time-consuming, therefore a method for the detection of the insert would be useful for making this procedure less time- and labor-intensive.  One of the early methods developed for the detection of insert is blue-white screening which allows for identification of successful products of cloning reactions through the colour of the [[bacterial]] colony.

The method is based on the principle of α-complementation of the [[Beta-galactosidase|β-galactosidase]] gene.  This phenomenon of α-complementation was first demonstrated in work done by [[Agnes Ullmann]] in the laboratory of [[François Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]], where the function of an inactive mutant β-galactosidase with deleted sequence was shown to be rescued by a fragment of β-galactosidase in which that same sequence, the α-donor peptide, is still intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this method, DNA ligated into the plasmid disrupts the α peptide and therefore the complementation process, and no functional β-galactosidase can form.  Cells transformed with plasmid containing an insert therefore form white colonies, while cells transformed with plasmid without an insert form blue colonies; result of a successful ligation can thus be easily identified by the white coloration of cells formed from the unsuccessful blue ones.&lt;ref name=sambrook&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual |author=Joseph Sambrook, David Russell |volume=1 |edition=3rd |chapter=Chapter 1 |page=1.27 |isbn=978-0-87969-577-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecular mechanism==
[[Image:Blue white assay Ecoli.jpg|thumb|250px| A schematic representation of the Blue-white assay, used to screen for recombinant vectors]]
[[Beta-galactosidase|β-galactosidase]] is a protein encoded by the ''lacZ'' gene of the [[Lac operon|''lac'' operon]], and it exists as a [[homotetramer]] in its active state.  However, a mutant β-galactosidase derived from the M15 strain of ''E. coli'' has its N-terminal residues 11—41 deleted and this mutant, the ω-peptide, is unable to form a tetramer and is inactive.  This mutant form of protein however may return fully to its active tetrameric state in the presence of an N-terminal fragment of the protein, the α-peptide.  The rescue of function of the mutant β-galactosidase by the α-peptide is called α-complementation.

In this method of screening, the host ''E. coli'' strain carries the ''lacZ'' deletion mutant (''lacZΔM15'') which contains the ω-peptide, while the plasmids used carry the ''lacZα'' sequence which encodes the first 59 residues of β-galactosidase, the α-peptide.  Neither is functional by itself.  However, when the two peptides are expressed together, as when a plasmid containing the ''lacZα'' sequence is transformed into a ''lacZΔM15'' cells, they form a functional [[β-galactosidase]] enzyme.
 
The blue/white screening method works by disrupting this α-complementation process.  The plasmid carries within the ''lacZα'' sequence an internal [[multiple cloning site]] (MCS).  This MCS within the ''lacZα'' sequence can be cut by restriction enzymes so that the foreign DNA may be inserted within the ''lacZ''α gene, thereby disrupting the gene that produces α-peptide.  Consequently, in cells containing the plasmid with an insert, no functional [[β-galactosidase]] may be formed.

The presence of an active β-galactosidase can be detected by [[X-gal]], a colourless [[Structural analog|analog]] of lactose that may be cleaved by β-galactosidase to form 5-bromo-4-chloro-indoxyl, which then spontaneously dimerizes and oxidizes to form a bright blue insoluble pigment 5,5'-dibromo-4,4'-dichloro-indigo.  This results in a characteristic blue colour in cells containing a functional β-galactosidase.  Blue colonies therefore show that they may contain a vector with an uninterrupted ''lacZα'' (therefore no insert), while white colonies, where X-gal is not hydrolyzed, indicate the presence of an insert in ''lacZα'' which disrupts the formation of an active β-galactosidase.

The recombinant clones can be further analyzed by isolating and purifying small amounts of plasmid DNA from the transformed colonies and restriction enzymes can be used to cut the clone and determine if it has the fragment of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38325074|title=Fundamental laboratory approaches for biochemistry and biotechnology|last=J.|first=Ninfa, Alexander|date=1998|publisher=Fitzgerald Science Press|others=Ballou, David P.|year=|isbn=1891786008|location=Bethesda, Md.|pages=355–356|oclc=38325074}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the DNA is necessary to be sequenced, the plasmids from the colonies will need to be isolated at a point, whether to cut using restriction enzymes or performing other assays.

==Practical considerations==
The correct type of [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]] and [[competent cell]]s are important considerations when planning a blue white screen.  The plasmid must contain the ''lacZ''α, and examples of such plasmids are [[pUC19]] and [[pBluescript]].  The ''E. coli'' cell should contain the mutant ''lacZ'' gene with deleted sequence (i.e. ''lacZΔM15''), and some of the commonly used cells with such genotype are JM109, DH5α, and XL1-Blue.

It should also be understood that the lac operon is affected by the presence of glucose.  The protein [[PEP group translocation|EIIA&lt;sup&gt;Glc&lt;/sup&gt;]], which is involved in glucose import, shuts down lactose permease when glucose is being transported into the cell.  The media used in agar plate therefore should not include glucose.

X-gal is light-sensitive and therefore its solution and plates containing X-gal should be stored in the dark.  [[Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside]] (IPTG), which functions as the inducer of the ''lac'' operon, may be used in the media to enhance the expression of LacZ.

[[X-gal]] is an expensive material, thus other methods have been developed in order to screen bacteria. [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] has been developed as an alternative to help screen bacteria. The concept is similar to α-complementation in which a DNA insert can disrupt the coding sequence within a vector and thus disrupt the GFP production resulting in non-fluorescing bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Speltz|first=Elizabeth B.|last2=Regan|first2=Lynne|date=June 2013|title=White and green screening with circular polymerase extension cloning for easy and reliable cloning|journal=Protein Science|language=en|volume=22|issue=6|pages=859–864|doi=10.1002/pro.2268|pmc=3690724|pmid=23592493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria that have recombinant vectors (vector + insert), will be white and not express the GFP protein, while non-recombinant (vector), will and fluoresce under UV light.

GFP in general has been used as a reporter gene where individuals can definitively determine if a clone carries a gene that researchers are analyzing. On occasion, the medium in which the colonies grow can influence the screen and introduce false-positive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=Sampali|last2=Kumar|first2=Jitendra|last3=Apte-Deshpande|first3=Anjali|last4=Padmanabhan|first4=Sriram|date=2010-05-11|title=A novel prokaryotic vector for identification and selection of recombinants: Direct use of the vector for expression studies in E. coli|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-9-30|journal=Microbial Cell Factories|volume=9|pages=30|doi=10.1186/1475-2859-9-30|issn=1475-2859}}&lt;/ref&gt; X-gal on the medium can occasionally degrade to produce a blue color or GFP can lose its fluorescence because of the medium and can impact researchers capabilities to determine colonies with the desire recombinant and those that do not possess it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=Sampali|last2=Kumar|first2=Jitendra|last3=Apte-Deshpande|first3=Anjali|last4=Padmanabhan|first4=Sriram|date=2010-05-11|title=A novel prokaryotic vector for identification and selection of recombinants: Direct use of the vector for expression studies in E. coli|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2859-9-30|journal=Microbial Cell Factories|volume=9|pages=30|doi=10.1186/1475-2859-9-30|issn=1475-2859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawbacks===
Some white colonies may not contain the desired recombinant plasmid for a number of reasons.  The ligated DNA may not be the correct one or not properly ligated, and it is possible for some linearized vector to be transformed, its ends "repaired" and ligated together such that no LacZα is produced and no blue colonies may be formed.  Mutation can also lead to the α-fragment not being expressed.  A colony with no vector at all will also appear white, and may sometimes appear as satellite colonies after the [[antibiotic]] used has been depleted. It is also possible that blue colonies may contain the insert. This occurs when the insert is "in frame" with the LacZα gene and a STOP codon is absent in the insert. This can lead to the expression of a fusion protein that has a functional LacZα if its structure is not disrupted. The correct recombinant construct can sometimes give lighter blue colonies which may complicate its identification.

Founded in 1972, it operates as an executive club and corporate university for a diverse set of 20 global companies including [[L’Oréal]], [[Aviva]], [[Renault]], [[Bekaert]], [[Valeo]], [[AXA]], [[GDF Suez]], and [[TATA Group|TATA Steel]]. CEDEP offers two types of programs: Open Enrollment, available to managers from all member companies, and Company Specific programs. Most programs are delivered on CEDEP's  purpose-built, residential campus, but in recent years CEDEP has been delivering programs off-campus, notably in China, Brazil, and Canada.

== History ==

CEDEP was created over 40 years ago by a group of European companies as an executive education club, and was among the first corporate-founded membership institutions in Europe dedicated to executive education.&lt;ref&gt;''The nucleus of Europe's management education'', The Times (of London) May 11, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;  In its early days, CEDEP was essentially a sister organization to INSEAD, which at the time focused on MBA education.&lt;ref name=CEDEPBook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Former des cadres sur mésure'' by Jacques Malherbe, l'Aurore. November 19, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  Faculty teaching at CEDEP in its early years were drawn almost exclusively from INSEAD's more experienced faculty, notably [[Henri-Claude de Bettignies]],  Robin Hogarth, Claude Rameau, and Lee Remmers.&lt;ref&gt;''INSEAD: d'une intuition a une institution'' by Jean-Louis Barsoux, INSEAD 2000, {{ISBN|0-333-92534-3}}, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial impetus was led by L'Oréal's head of Human Resources, Guy Landon, and [[François Dalle]], its CEO.  They were joined by {{ill|Antoine Riboud|fr}} and Jean-Leon Donnadieu (BSN, which later merged with Gervais-Danone), {{ill|Renaud Gillet|fr}} (Pricel and Rhone Progil, which would become part of the Rhone-Poulenc group), {{ill|Antoine Bekaert|nl}} (Bekaert), and René Dunant (Sandoz).&lt;ref&gt;''Cedep: une "vraie" formation permanente'' by Martine Borrelly, Les Informations No. 1384&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''M Renaud Gillet: vice président du Rhone Poulenc'' by A.V., Le Figaro, August 24, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; The three main objectives for the founders were to: (1) expose managers to a mix of nationalities and industry contexts; (2) provide participants with a contrast between the theories and practice of management; and (3) create a force for change within their companies by establishing a critical mass of managers who had shared a key educational experience.&lt;ref&gt;''Assessing management education: A summary of the CEDEP project'' by R. M. Hogarth, Journal of European Industrial Training, 2, (Whole No. 2), pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The CEDEP campus was opened in 1971 by the then French Finance Minister, [[Valery Giscard d'Estaing]],&lt;ref&gt;''Inauguration à Fontainebleau du centre européen d'education permanente'' by G.S., Le Figaro November 19, 1971 (Section "Université")&lt;/ref&gt; who was to become France's President just three years later.  Designed by a contemporary French architect, Bernard de la Tour d'Auvergne, who also helped design the original buildings on the INSEAD campus, the buildings combine brick and glass to reflect the colors of the surrounding [[Fontainebleau Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;''Architecture d'Aujourd'hui'' No. 160, Fevrier-Mars 1972 pp. 54-7&lt;/ref&gt;  The buildings were extended in 2000 with additional wings that conserve the architectural style of the original buildings.  The campus grounds also feature large sculptures by a number of celebrated European sculptors, including [[wikipedia:Les Lalanne|Francois-Xavier and Claude Lalanne]], who designed the original campus,&lt;ref name=CEDEPBook&gt;''CEDEP: 40 Years of Adding Value'' (an official history of CEDEP),CEDEP 2012, {{ISBN|978-2-7466-3440-4}}, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marino di Teana|Francesco Marino di Teana]].  The campus interior houses a notable collection of contemporary wall carpets by the likes of [[Sonia Delaunay]] (co-founder of the [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] movement), {{ill|Ivan da Silva-Bruhns|fr}} and [[Natalia Dumitresco]].&lt;ref name=CEDEPBook /&gt;

CEDEP's evolution was greatly influenced by two long-serving Directors. In 1971 Salvatore Teresi, an INSEAD Marketing professor who was also one of CEDEP's founders, became its first Director General. Over the following 20 years he oversaw an expansion in membership to 23 companies that resulted in more than 6,000 participants attending CEDEP's programs.&lt;ref&gt;''CEDEP Twenty Years After And For A New Departure'', Text of addresses given by Guy LANDON, Claude RAMEAU, and Salvatore TERESI to mark the retirement of Salvatore TERESI as Director of CEDEP, printed by HELIO SERVICE 1991, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claude Michaud]], Teresi's Deputy Director (and also an INSEAD professor), took over in 1991 and led CEDEP for the next 16 years. Under his leadership CEDEP extended its membership to 20 members, including companies from outside Europe, most notably Tata Steel.&lt;ref name=CEDEPBook /&gt;  It was also under Michaud's tenure that CEDEP started offering off-campus programs, in Hong Kong, Singapore, and India.&lt;ref name=CEDEPBook /&gt;  Under the tenure of Michaud's successor, [[Han van Dissel]], CEDEP extended its overseas activities, offering off-campus programs in China, Brazil, Canada and South Korea.

In 1979, an INSEAD decision-science professor, Robin M Hogarth, who also taught at CEDEP, undertook an in-depth study of CEDEP's General Management Program in order to assess whether executive education improved managerial decision-making.  This project resulted in a book, ''Evaluating Management Education,'' published by John Wiley &amp; Sons in 1979 ( {{ISBN|978-0471997399}}).

'''Carbon Grid''' [[Fibre-reinforced plastic]] (FRP) structures are used for [[reinforced concrete|reinforcing concrete]].

== Technology ==
[[Carbon fiber]] [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|FRP]] Grids are structural reinforcement materials that improve the performance of [[concrete]] [[structure]]s such as insulated wall panels, architectural panels, double tee parking garage tee beams, concrete countertops and other products. The carbon grids can be used in place of welded wire mesh in most structures and is imbedded the same way as a welded wire mesh. Carbon fiber's high [[strength of materials|strength]], high [[Elastic modulus|modulus]], resistance to [[creep (deformation)|creep]] and excellent [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] properties allow the carbon grid to provide excellent crack and structural reinforcement. Ideally the carbon tows (yarns) are constructed on top of each other in a superimposed design those aides with fiber alignment and toughness of the finished grid.

==Applications with concrete in general==
Concrete is inherently strong in [[Compression (physics)|compression]] and weak in [[Tension (physics)|tension]]. To address this issue, concrete is often reinforced with [[steel]] in the form of rebar, welded wire mesh or stressing strands (Prestressed or post-tensioned). In theory, the concrete has to crack when loaded in tension for the steel to begin to share the load in the steel reinforced concrete composite. The concrete helps protect the steel by providing an alkaline environment (ph=13 in many cases) to retard corrosion of the steel. To properly protect the steel the concrete needs to cover the steel by more than the minimum thickness, not have large cracks and not have its chemistry altered by environmental factors like [[chloride]] attack from deicing salts, [[carbonation]], etc.. ACI and PCI (American Concrete Institute, Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute) codes specify minimum cover thicknesses depending on the application of the structure. In practice, steel often corrodes due to improper placement of steel reinforcement, moisture drive through cracks, poor workmanship, environmental effects such as deicing salts or coastal environments and a myriad of other causes. Due to the inherent properties of steel reinforced concrete, many structures are expensive, heavy and costly to maintain. The repair of these structures is a multibillion-dollar business worldwide according to industry sources (ICRI International Concrete Repair Institute).

==Applications with concrete panels==
Multi-layer concrete structures (like insulated walls panels) use a sandwich technology that use [[Building insulation|insulation]] layers placed in between two or more layers of concrete. Often these concrete layers are tied together by sections of solid concrete, metal tie structures or FRP pin structures. Often, the design of the wall panel is limited by lack of effective insulation in the tie areas or poor structural performance of the tie design or solid section. These limitations cause structures to be weaker, heavier and more costly both in manufacturing and ownership.

==Benefits==
Carbon grids provide a corrosion resistant reinforcement that has a higher modulus of elasticity than steel that is imbedded inside concrete (similar to conventional steel mesh). This allows for designs that don't require as much concrete cover, so concrete structures can be lighter and much more durable than before. For instance, using carbon fiber grid in insulated wall panels can provide a stronger, lighter, more thermally efficient panel than is practical with conventional designs. Due to the lighter weight less energy is required to provide the necessary concrete and ship products adding an [[Natural environment|environmental]] incentive to using this technology.

FRP fabrics that are used as external reinforcements are impregnated with polymer on the job site and have to be bonded to a surface of a concrete structure. In contrast, carbon grids provide an internal reinforcement and have fibers that are impregnated with a polymer (typically epoxy) in a factory rather than on the job site, saving time and ensuring consistent quality. Also, the open spaces of the grid provide a mechanical bond to transfer load within the concrete structure.

Additional benefits of the carbon grid structure are that it is light, easy to handle, non-magnetic and easier to cut than steel. These properties allow for use where steel is impractical or cumbersome.

==History==
Carbon grids have been manufactured by Chomarat North America (formerly TechFab LLC) since 1998 and have found commercial uses in concrete countertops, shotcrete, ornamental concrete, caststone products, precast insulated wall panels, double tee beams and a myriad of other concrete products. These materials have also been used in numerous repair projects including the Naumburg Band shell in New York City cited on the website www.carbongrid.com. A variety of product strengths and apertures are offered depending on the application.

==Limitations==
The main limitation of the carbon grid is the additional cost of carbon as compared to mild carbon steel (with rising energy costs this gap has narrowed). In addition, since carbon is a linear elastic material (without a yield point), reinforced concrete structures have to be designed to account for this. Carbon fiber grids can be used in design by following the [[American Concrete Institute]] - ACI 440 methodology similar to FRP[[rebar]]. Typically, the structure will also use steel in an appropriate location or be over designed so that the structure fails by crushing the concrete in tension providing ductility.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5060">'''Chronostratigraphy''' is the branch of [[stratigraphy]] that studies the age of rock [[stratum|strata]] in relation to [[time]].

The ultimate aim of chronostratigraphy is to arrange the sequence of deposition and the time of deposition of all rocks within a geological region, and eventually, the entire geologic record of the Earth.

The standard stratigraphic nomenclature is a chronostratigraphic system based on palaeontological intervals of time defined by recognised fossil assemblages ([[biostratigraphy]]). The aim of chronostratigraphy is to give a meaningful [[geochronology|age date]] to these fossil assemblage intervals and interfaces.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Methodology ==
Chronostratigraphy relies heavily upon [[isotope geology]] and [[geochronology]] to derive hard dating of known and well defined rock units which contain the specific fossil assemblages defined by the stratigraphic system. As it is practically very difficult to isotopically date most fossils and sedimentary rocks directly, inferences must be made in order to arrive at an age date which reflects the beginning of the interval.

The methodology used is derived from the law of superposition and the principles of cross-cutting relationships.

Because [[igneous]] rocks occur at specific intervals in time and are essentially instantaneous on a geologic time scale, and because they contain mineral assemblages which may be dated more accurately and precisely by isotopic methods, the construction of a chronostratigraphic column relies heavily upon intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks.

Metamorphism, often associated with faulting, may also be used to bracket depositional intervals in a chronostratigraphic column. Metamorphic rocks can occasionally be dated, and this may give some limits to the age at which a bed could have been laid down. For example, if a bed containing graptolites overlies crystalline basement at some point, dating the crystalline basement will give a maximum age of that fossil assemblage.

This process requires a considerable degree of effort and checking of field relationships and age dates. For instance, there may be many millions of years between a bed being laid down and an intrusive rock cutting it; the estimate of age must necessarily be between the oldest cross-cutting intrusive rock in the fossil assemblage and the youngest rock upon which the fossil assemblage rests.

== Units ==
Chronostratigraphic units, with examples:&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite book|title=Glossary of Geology|year=1997|publisher=American Geological Institute|location=Alexandria, VI|isbn=0-922152-34-9|edition=4th|editor=Juia A. Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*eonothem – [[Phanerozoic]]
*erathem – [[Paleozoic]]
*system – [[Ordovician]]
*series – Upper Ordovician
*stage – Ashgill

== Differences from geochronology ==

It is important not to confuse geochronologic and chronostratigraphic units.&lt;ref name=Fastovsly&amp;Weishampel&gt;{{cite book|last=Fastovsly|first=David E.|title=The Evolution and Extinction of the Dinosaurs|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=0-521-44496-9|author2=Weishampel, David B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chronostratigraphic units are geological material, so it is correct to say that fossils of the species ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' have been found in the Upper Cretaceous Series.&lt;ref name=giantsauropod&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=J. B.|author2=Lamanna, M.C. |author3=Lacovara, K.J. |author4=Dodson, P. Jr. |author5=Poole, J.C. |author6= Giegengack, R. |title=A Giant Sauropod Dinosaur from an Upper Cretaceous Mangrove Deposit in Egypt|journal=Science|date=1 June 2001|volume=292|issue=5522|pages=1704–1706|doi=10.1126/science.1060561|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/292/5522/1704.full|accessdate=2 February 2013|issn=1095-9203|pmid=11387472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geochronological units are periods of time and take the same name as standard stratigraphic units but replacing the terms upper/lower with late/early. Thus it is also correct to say that ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' lived during the [[Late Cretaceous]] Epoch.&lt;ref name=ICSchronostrat&gt;International Commission on Stratigraphy. [http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/bak/chron.htm "Chronostratigraphic Units."] ''International Stratigraphic Guide''. Accessed 14-DEC-2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronostratigraphy is an important branch of stratigraphy because the age correlations derived are crucial to drawing accurate cross sections of the spatial organization of rocks and to preparing accurate paleogeographic reconstructions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2198">'''Classical reception studies''' is the study of how the [[Classics|Classical world]], especially [[Ancient Greek literature]] and [[Latin literature]], have been received since antiquity. Influenced by [[reception theory]], it departs from the [[Classical tradition]] in various ways.

==Definition==
[[Lorna Hardwick]] and [[Christopher Stray]] assert that Classical reception studies is devoted to examining "the ways in which Greek and Roman material has been transmitted, translated, excerpted, interpreted, rewritten, re-imaged and represented".{{sfn|Hardwick|Stray|2008|p=1}} Martindale notes that Classical reception "encompasses all work concerned with postclassical material".{{sfn|Martindale|2006|p=1}}

Hardwick and Stray state that scholars of reception studies hold the relationship between the ancient and modern to be reciprocal, although they acknowledge that others believe that reception studies only shed light on the receiving society, and not on the ancient text or its context.{{sfn|Hardwick|Stray|2008|p=4}}

''Not to be confused with [[computer engineering]].''

'''Computational science and engineering''' (CSE) is a relatively new discipline that deals with the development and application of computational models and simulations, often coupled with [[high-performance computing]], to solve complex physical problems arising in engineering analysis and design (computational engineering) as well as natural phenomena ([[computational science]]). CSE has been described as the "third mode of discovery" (next to theory and experimentation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cseprograms.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/CSEHandbook-Students-v11.pdf |title=Computational Science and Engineering Program: Graduate Student Handbook | website=cseprograms.gatech.edu |date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many fields, computer simulation is integral and therefore essential to business and research. Computer simulation provides the capability to enter fields that are either inaccessible to traditional experimentation or where carrying out traditional empirical inquiries is prohibitively expensive. CSE should neither be confused with pure [[computer science]], nor with [[computer engineering]], although a wide domain in the former is used in CSE (e.g., certain algorithms, data structures, parallel programming, high performance computing) and some problems in the latter can be modeled and solved with CSE methods (as an application area).

It is typically offered as a [[Master of Science|masters]] or [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] program at several institutions.

==Methods==
Computational Science and Engineering methods and frameworks include:
* [[High performance computing]] and techniques to gain efficiency (through change in computer architecture, parallel algorithms etc.)
* [[Computer model|Modeling]] and [[simulation]]
* [[Algorithms]] for solving discrete and continuous problems
* Analysis and visualization of data
* Mathematical foundations: Numerical and applied linear algebra, initial &amp; boundary value problems, Fourier analysis, optimization
* [[Data_science|Data Science]] for developing methods and algorithms to handle and  extract  knowledge from large scientific data
With regard to computing, computer programming, algorithms, and parallel computing play a major role in CSE. The most widely used programming language in the scientific community is [[FORTRAN]]. Recently, [[C++]] and C have increased in popularity over FORTRAN. Due to the wealth of legacy code in FORTRAN and its simpler syntax, the scientific computing community has been slow in completely adopting C++ as the lingua franca. Because of its very natural way of expressing mathematical computations, and its built-in visualization capacities, the proprietary language/environment [[MATLAB]] is also widely used, especially for rapid application development and model verification. [[Python (programming language)|Python]] along with external libraries (such as [[NumPy]], [[SciPy]], [[Matplotlib]]) has gain some popularity as a free and [[Copycenter]] alternative to MATLAB.
==Applications==

'''Design Studies''' is an [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] that pursues a critical understanding of [[design]] and its effects through analytical and practical modes of inquiry. Its origins can be traced to [[design history]] where the field first got its start&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan|first1=Richard|title=Design Research and the New Learning|journal=Design Issues|date=2001|volume=17,|issue=4|pages=3–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; before slowly expanding to include larger themes and more varied subject matters. In that light, Victor Margolin, one of the founders of the discipline in the US, proposes Design Studies as a term that comprises various design researches and relates them to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=Design History or Design Studies: Subject Matter and Methods|journal=Design Issues|date=1995|volume=11|issue= 1|pages=4–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a highly interdisciplinary field, Design Studies references many scholarship paradigms and focuses on how design knowledge is developed, articulated and communicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cross|first1=Nigel|title=Design Research: A Disciplined Conversation|date=1999|volume=15|issue=02|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore incorporates an expansive set of evolving methodologies and theories that are drawn from key thinkers and theorists from the field itself (such as [[Victor Margolin]], Clive Dilnot, and [[Richard Buchanan (academic)|Richard Buchanan]]), but also from several related fields such as, the [[humanities]] ([[literature]], [[art]], [[Visual Studies|visual studies]], [[cultural studies]]), the [[social science]]s ([[anthropology]], [[political science]]s, and [[sociology]]), the [[science]]s ([[engineering]], [[Materials science|material]] studies, [[neurology]], [[technology]] studies). Design Studies also generates scholarly work in the fields of [[architecture]], [[urban planning]] and [[Urban policy|policy]], and spatial studies. Design Studies not only considers objects, places and systems, it investigates their meanings, contexts, possibilities and consequences.

Design Studies recognizes that design, as a practice, is merely one facet of a much larger paradigm. It examines, probes, and questions the role of design in shaping past and present personal and cultural values, especially in light of how they shape the future. The subjects of Design Studies are inherently fluid while being anchored to a core body of work and scholarship that revolves around broader themes such as [[ethics]], environmental sustainment, and [[social sustainability]].

The American author, editor and educator Susan Yelavich, encapsulates the terrain of Design Studies as embracing "two broad perspectives—one that focuses inward on the nature of design and one that looks outward to the circumstances that shape it, and conversely, the circumstances design changes, intentionally or not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adht.parsons.edu/designstudies/double_profile_of_design_studie/|title=The Double Profile of Design Studies - Design Studies|website=adht.parsons.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== History of Design Studies ===
The history of the field of Design Studies can be traced to the early 1960s in England. In 1962, a “Conference on Design Methods” held in London led to the emergence of the [[Design Research Society]], bringing together academics and practitioners who shared interests in new approaches to the process of designing.&lt;ref name="Forty Years of Design Research"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cross|first1=Nigel|title=Forty Years of Design Research|journal=Design Studies|date=2007|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=https://www.designresearchsociety.org/cpages/about|website=Design Research Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, a series of conferences were held that helped continue the development of the [http://www.drs2016.org/222/ Design Methods Movement (DMM)]— a product of the post-war optimism of the 1950s, cancelled in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross, Margolin|first1=Nigel, Victor|title=A History of Design Methodology, Design Methodology and Relationships with Science|date=1993|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement focused on the comparison between science and design and tried to determine methods that distinguished design as an important academic field apart from the realm of art and art history. However, in 1980 at the Design Research Society’s [https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005784314 Design:Science:Method] conference concluded that there was not much for design to learn from science, instead, science had something to learn from design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cross, Margolin|first1=Nigel, Victor|title=A History of Design Methodology, Design Methodology and Relationships with Science|date=1993|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point, design became a discipline of study “based on the view that design has its own things to know and its own ways of knowing them.” This stance was promulgated in the first issue of ''[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/design-studies Design Studies]'' with the launch of a series of articles in its pages called “Design as a Discipline''.''”&lt;ref name="Forty Years of Design Research"/&gt; (''[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/design-studies Design Studies, The Interdisciplinary Journal of Design Research]'' as it is now known, was first published as Design Studies 1, no.1 in July 1979. Produced by the publisher Reed Elsevier known since 2015 as [[Elsevier]]). The series began with [[L. Bruce Archer|Bruce Archer]], and his 1979 essay, “Whatever became of Design Methodology?”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Archer|first1=Bruce|title=Whatever Became of Design Methodology?|journal=Design Studies|date=1979|volume=1|issue=1|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his accompanying article from the same issue titled "The Three Rs," Archer places [[Design]] with a capital D as a third extreme in an education triangle with the [[Science]]s and [[Humanities]] situating design, though not exclusively, within acts of configuration, composition, meaning, value, and purpose in man-made phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Archer|first1=Bruce|title=The Three Rs|journal=Design Studies|date=1979|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debates about the discipline of design and design research continued through the 1980s and were significantly reignited in 1995 when [[Victor Margolin]], an American scholar who contributed to the development of design history, argued for a new approach to “Design Studies.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=Design History or Design Studies: Subject Matter and Methods|journal=Design Issues|date=1995|volume=11|issue= 1|page=14|doi=10.2307/1511610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margolin referred to the "dynamic crossings of intellectual boundaries" when describing the interdisciplinary nature of intellectual practice at the time. He felt that early design historians should question "whether design history as it [had] been constituted...[was] a viable enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=Design History or Design Studies: Subject Matter and Methods|journal=v|date=1995|volume=11|issue= 1|pages=4–15|doi=10.2307/1511610}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gooding, J. V., “Design History in Britain From the 1970's to 2012: Context, Formation and Development, Ph.D. Dissertation University of Northumbria, Newcastle (January 2012) p. 200-203&lt;/ref&gt;

Margolin defines design studies as a field of inquiry that addresses how we make and use products and how we have done so in the past. These products compromise the domain in the artificial. Design studies addresses ideas of product conception and planning, production, form, distribution, and use. It considers these topics in the present as well as in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Margolin|first1=Victor|title=The Politics of the Artificial: essays on design and design studies|date=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margolin's position triggered counter arguments about how to characterize the study of design. A battle in print began with his article titled, “Design history or design studies: subject matter and methods” published in the international journal ''Design Studies (Design Studies was the journal of the [[Design Research Society]], founded in the UK in 1966; the journal itself has been in publication since 1979).'' This controversial topic had resonance in Britain where [[Adrian Forty]]’s response appeared in the pages of the ''[[Journal of Design History]]'', in which he argued in favor of research that led to the understanding of quality judgements defining good design "as an entirely legitimate field for design historical research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=DEBATE: A Reply to Victor Margolin|journal=Journal of Design History|date=1 January 1993|volume= 6|issue= 2|pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of this debate was made clear by the fact that it was reprinted in a special issue of ''[[Design Issues]]'' in 1995 where it refocused attention on "some of the controversies and problems that surround the seemingly simple task of telling the history of design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan, Doordan &amp; Margolin|first1=Richard, Dennis, Victor|title=Introduction|journal=v|date=Spring 1995|volume=11|issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift from Design History to Design Studies started to occur as the research and approaches to the field began to focus on broader questions of meaning, authority and power, in other words, with the dynamics surrounding and enabling the practice of design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whiteley|first1=Nigel|title=Design History or Design Studies|date=1995|volume=1|issue= 1|pages=38–42|doi=10.2307/1511614}}&lt;/ref&gt; The realization came that Design History is only “but one component of what goes on in studying design, and to claim that all that is going on now could use the umbrella term 'design history’ is not tenable.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whiteley|first1=Nigel|title=Design History or Design Studies|date=1995|volume=1|issue= 1|page=40|doi=10.2307/1511614}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new field of Design Studies would now include not only design history, but also allow for a dialogue about “issues of product conception and planning, production, form, distribution, and use” in a historical and contemporary context.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Foundational Figures ===
[[L. Bruce Archer]]. (1922-2005) was a British mechanical engineer and later Professor of [[Design Research]] at the [[Royal College of Art]] who championed research in design, and helped to establish design as an academic discipline. Archer trained a generation of design researchers, showing them how the procedures of scholarly research based on well-founded evidence and systematic analysis were as applicable in design as in the more traditional academic subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Archer|first1=Bruce|title=A View of the Nature of Design Research Design:Science:Method|date=1981|publisher=Westbury House|location=Guildford}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 he helped to found the cross-disciplinary [[Design Research Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Bruce, ‘A View of the Nature of Design Research’, in Jacques, R and Powell, J (eds), Design:Science:Method, Westbury House, Guildford, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

An Australian academic, Cameron Tonkinwise has a background in philosophy, with a particular emphasis on Heidegger's genealogy of thought and its informing design practice. Having worked closely with Tony Fry at the [http://www.changedesign.org/ Ecodesign Foundation] in the 1990s, Tonkinwise later headed initiatives in sustainability at Parsons, The New School, and later became chair of design studies at Carnegie Mellon University, where he set up the [https://design.cmu.edu/content/phd PhD programs] in [http://transitiondesign.net/ Transition Design] and Design Studies. Cameron's primary area of research is sustainable design and designing for socio-technical transitions - in particular, he focuses on the design of systems that lower societal materials intensity, primarily by decoupling use and ownership, i.e systems of shared use.

[[Adrian Forty]]: (born 1948) was Professor of Architectural History at The Bartlett, The Faculty of the Built Environment at University College London. Forty believed that the drive to define a new field, the field of Design Studies, was unnecessary due to the fact that the field of Design History had not exhausted all of its possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forty|first1=Adrian|title=Debate: A Reply to Victor Margolin|journal=Design Issues|date=1995|volume=''11|issue= 1|pages=16–18|doi=10.2307/1511611}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Objects of Desire''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26320994|title=Objects of desire : design and society since 1750|last=Forty|first=Adrian,|date=1992|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=|isbn=0500274126|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=|oclc=26320994}}&lt;/ref&gt; explores how consumer goods relate to larger issues of social processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Objects of desire : design and society since 1750|last1=Forty|first1=Adrian|date=1992|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=|isbn=0500274126|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Heskett]] (1937-2014) In the late 1970s, Heskett became a prominent member of a group of academics based in several of Britain's art schools (then part of the polytechnics) who helped develop the discipline of design history and theory, later to become subsumed under the broader banner of Design Studies. In subsequent years, as design became a global practice increasingly valued by corporations and governments alike, design history became, along with design pedagogy, one of the nation's most successful academic exports. Heskett brought his deep knowledge of economics, politics and history to the project and worked alongside scholars from other disciplines to communicate the meaning and function of that increasingly important concept, "design", both past and present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sparke|first1=Penny|title=John Heskett obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/12/john-heskett|website=the guardian|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor Margolin]] (DS-History) Considered one of the founders of Design Studies, Victor Margolin is Professor Emeritus of Design History at the University of Illinois, Chicago. He is a co-editor of the academic design journal, ''Design Issues'', and is the author, editor, or co-editor of a number of books including ''Design Discourse'', ''Discovering Design'', ''The Idea of Design'', ''The Designed World'', and ''The Politics of the Artificial''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CMU Design Lecture Series: How do you Design the Future|url=http://www.design.cmu.edu/designthefuture/victor-margolin/|accessdate=Oct 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development Outside Anglo-Saxon ===
According to Ahmed Ansari, Danah Abdulla, Ece Canli, Mahmoud Keshavarz, Matthew Kiem, Pedro Oliveira, Luiza Prado, and Tristan Schultz who make up the ''[http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/ Decolonising Design Group]'', “Coloniality is not an abstract concept nor is it a subject to be examined from a comfortable distance. It is something that affects our communities, our countries and our peoples every single day. It is a continuous process of domination and violence to which we are submitted. It demeans our knowledge, subjugates our bodies, and renders our lives arduous.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decolonising Design, A Statement on the Design Research Society Conference 2016|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/drs2016statement/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established via their online blog “[http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/ Decolonising Design],” this collective of design researchers, academics, and practitioners working in and with the fields of Design Studies and Design Research firmly believe that “decolonisation is imperative for survival.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decolonising Design, A Statement on the Design Research Society Conference 2016|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/drs2016statement/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Decolonising Design Group's effort was born from their frustrations with academia during the events that led up to their withdrawal from the 2016 Design Research Society Conference and driven by their desire to engage in a profound debate of the colonial ethos of design and research. The collective believes it is, “not sufficient for design studies and design research to simply include a greater ‘diversity of perspectives’ as a means to delay and offset demands for radical systemic change.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decolonising Design, A Statement on the Design Research Society Conference 2016|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/drs2016statement/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the purpose of transforming the agenda of design studies and design research, the group organized a symposium on decolonization titled “Intersectional Perspectives on Design, Politics &amp; Power” which was held at the School of Arts and Communication, Malmö University, Sweden on 14–15 November 2016. For these [relatively] young academics, the field of design studies is not “geared towards delivering the kinds of knowledge and understanding that are adequate to addressing the systemic problems that arise from the coloniality of power.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial Statement|url=http://www.decolonisingdesign.com/statements/2016/editorial/#more-1|website=Decolonising Design|accessdate=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They argue that design history and design research tends to have the most influence from the triad of Western Europe, North America, and Japan.&lt;ref name="Design studies: a reader"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Matthew|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford:|pages=20–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect tends to be in line with the notion that history is written by the victors and thus design history is written by the economically powerful.&lt;ref name="Design studies: a reader"/&gt; They point to concurrent histories outside of the western context. For instance, Hong Kong has a unique system of design that was established prior to the economic growth of the Pearl River delta which can be found in the continuities of design in product types and styles, manufacturing and printing companies, and families of artist-designers.&lt;ref name="Design studies: a reader"/&gt; Or in Cuba for instance, where the origins of design was influenced by the crisis of “modern movement ideology and the ideologies oh how to escape underdevelopment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1847882363|pages=25–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries lie on the periphery of the westernized view of design history and design studies and in some instances may have suffered in their adaptation of European modernity. As such, [[Gui Bonsiepe]], a German designer, teacher, and writer, suggested that “Decolonization in all its manifestations, economic, technological and cultural, should be the goal of project activity in the periphery.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1847882363|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for understanding design as a global and multicultural phenomenon is also argued by Jonathan M. Woodham, [[Victor Margolin]], and Anna Calvera in Denise Whitehouse’s collection of essays.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|title=Design studies: a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1847882363|pages=54–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together their aim is to “create a theoretical narrative that brings intellectual logic to the multiple stories of how different countries… have negotiated the process of Westernization and the idea of design according to their specific economic, geographical, political, and cultural circumstances.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

As Whitehouse points out, “While many countries produce local histories of design, the output is uneven and often driven by nationalist and trade agendas.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Academic groups like the Japanese [http://www.designhistoryforum.org/ Design History Forum] and [http://www.ub.edu/icdhs/ The International Committee for Design History and Studies (ICDHS)] draw together both western and non-western, post-communist, postcolonial, Asian, and Southern Hemisphere, “to remap the scope and narrative concerns of design history.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Approaches and Scope ==
Design Studies thinks ambitiously about design, beyond its professional enclaves, and studies the significance and consequences of design activity in the modern world. It looks at design as a complex and multifarious activity and examines the forces that design exerts in, and on, the world—forces design sets in motion but does not control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yelavich|first1=Susan|title=What Is/Are Design Studies?|url=http://adht.parsons.edu/designstudies/what-is-are-design-studies/|website=|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of Design Studies views design as both the embodiment of the imminent future (by virtue of behaviors it triggers and resources it depletes) and as a means of envisioning alternative futures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yelavich|first1=Susan|title=What Is/Are Design Studies?|url=http://adht.parsons.edu/designstudies/what-is-are-design-studies/|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because Design Studies is interdisciplinary (moving between disciplines), multi-disciplinary (utilizing multiple disciplines in its process and methods) and transdisciplinary (combining disciplines in creating new disciplinary structures),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NC State|title=What is Design Studies, Anyway?|url=https://design.ncsu.edu/design-studies/|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  its approaches and scopes are not constrained by any boundaries of academic disciplines. It is promiscuous and draws on the knowledge of philosophy, sociology, anthropology, literature, cultural theory, politics and the sciences to ask questions of what is design, and how can we comprehend its acting in the world by analyzing its possibilities and limits.

As an organized field of study, Design Studies is substantiated by its own academic and professional discourse and theoretical perspectives concerning the ways we think about design—its nature, purpose, agency, configuration, engagement, deployment, place, responsibilities, ethics, politics, problems, environment, sustainment, potentialities and alternative futures. It focuses on describing the why, the how and the what of design. It does not limit its inquiry to prescriptive definitions of what design is supposed to be, but instead it aims to understand (and study) the possibilities of what design can achieve and uses varied methodologies to explore the delineations and synergies between academic inquiry, critical theory and design practice. Its scholars explore the coherent structures and intellectual parameters of how design is encountered in the world, as well as analyze which different modes of contemporary practice are rethinking design to propose and realize alternative futures.

== Subject(s) of Design Studies ==
As an organized field of study, Design Studies is a discipline concerned with design as a practice and as an intervention in the world. It is substantiated by its own academic and professional discourses and theoretical perspectives concerning ways to think about design—its nature, purpose, agency, configuration, engagement, deployment, place, responsibilities, ethics, politics, problems, environment, sustainment, potentialities and alternative futures. It does not limit its inquiry to prescriptive definitions of what design is supposed to be, but instead it aims to understand (and study) the possibilities of what design can achieve by using various methodologies to analyze the delineations and synergies between academic inquiry, design practice and critical theory.

Design Studies analyzes how different modes of contemporary practice are rethinking design to propose and realize alternative futures using approaches such as those conventions listed under [[design]] as well as:

== Issues and Concepts in Design Studies ==
Design Studies asks us to think about the meaning of design. It studies the influence of designers and the effects design has on citizens and the environment.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/268792485|title=Design studies : a reader|date=2009|publisher=Berg|others=Clark, Hazel., Brody, David Eric.|isbn=9781847882363|edition=English|location=Oxford|oclc=268792485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Margolin distinguishes a degree in Design from a degree in Design Studies by saying that “the former is about producing design, while the latter is about reflecting on design as it has been practiced, is currently practiced, and how it might be practiced.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drs2016.org/009/|title=Design Research: What is it? What is it for?|website=DRS2016|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design Studies urges to rethink design as a process, as a practice, and as a generator or products and systems that gives lives meaning and sustains our economic and political systems. Design thinking invites to explore the complexities inherent to the task of thinking about design.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"/&gt; Design Studies is concerned with the relationship between design and gender, design and race, and design and culture. It studies issues such as ethics, sustainment (social and environmental) and works with concepts such as agency and the artificial.

=== Issues ===

==== Ethics ====
Design has the capacity of structuring life in certain ways and thus design should result in the greater good for individuals and society but it doesn’t always do so. Ethics deals with how our actions affect others. Design Studies sees ethics as central to design. Tony Fry, a leading figure in Design Studies claims, “Design is quintessentially an ethical process but despite this recognition that ethics is integral to design in many ways, design ethics remains ‘massively underdeveloped and even in its crudest forms remains marginal within design education.” It is important to involve ethics in the design process, especially as the world we inhabit is increasingly becoming artificial.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"/&gt;

Clive Dilnot’s essay, [https://www.amazon.com/Design-Studies-Reader-Hazel-Clark/dp/1847882366 ''Ethics in Design –'' ''Ten Questions'']'','' explores why we need ethics in design, what is the relationship between design and ethics. Dilnot writes that ethics should as a responsibility, as the ability of the designer to address the public as citizens and not as consumers or as the infusing of “humane intelligence” into the made environment, assume the possibility of truly human – humane, sustainable ways or making and remaking the world.&lt;ref name="Design studies : a reader"/&gt;

==== Sustainment: Environmental and Social ====

=== Concepts ===
==== The Artificial ====
Clive Dilnot goes further and clarifies that the artificial is by no means confined to technology. Today, it is combination of technical systems, the symbolic realm, including mind and the realm of our transformations and transmutations of nature. He gives the example of a [[genetically modified tomato]] that is neither purely natural nor purely artificial. It belongs rather to the extended realms of living things that are, as human beings ourselves are, a hybrid between these conditions – Neither nature nor the artificial nor the human are today pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/858895940|title=Design as future-making|others=Yelavich, Susan,|isbn=9780857858399|location=London|oclc=858895940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design Studies scholars also reference sociologist [[Bruno Latour]] when investigating the dynamics of the artificial. Latour's concept of [[Actor–network theory|Actor-Network Theory]] (ANT) portrays the social as an interdependent network of human individual actors and actants, which are non-human, non-individual entities. ANT aims at accounting for the very essence of societies and natures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Latour|first=Bruno|date=1996|title=On actor-network theory: A few clarifications|jstor=40878163|journal=Soziale Welt|volume=47|issue=4|pages=369–381|doi=10.2307/40878163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Agency ====
Design plays a constitutive role in everyday life. We engage design with all of our senses – The things we see and read, the objects we use, and the places we inhabit are all designed. These products (all artificial because they are catalyzed by people) constitute an increasingly large part of the world. The built environment is the physical infrastructure that enables behavior, activity, routines, habits, and rituals, which affect our agency. Jamer Hunt defines the built environment as the combination of all design work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51931174|title=Strangely familiar : design and everyday life|date=2003|publisher=Walker Art Center|others=Blauvelt, Andrew, 1964-, Walker Art Center., Carnegie Museum of Art., Musée de l'Hospice Comtesse.|isbn=9780935640755|edition=1st|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|oclc=51931174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Methods  ==
=== Design Ethnography  ===

This form of research requires the scholar to partake in the use of, or observe others use, a designed object or system. Design-based Ethnography has become a common tool where design is observed as a social practice. It describes a process in which a researcher will partake in traditional observant style ethnography, and observe potential users complete activities that can inform design opportunities and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://designobserver.com/article.php?id=5467|title=Design's Ethnographic Turn|work=Design Observer|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other ethnographic techniques used by Design Studies scholars would fall more in line with anthropologists usage of the method. These techniques are observant and [[Participant observation|participant ethnography]]. The observant style requires the scholar to observe in an unobtrusive manner. Observations are recorded and further analyzed. The participant style requires the scholar to partake in the activities with their subject. This tactic enables the scholar to record what they see, but also what they themselves experience.

=== Actor-Network Theory  ===

While it remains a broader theory or concept Actor-Network theory can be used by Design Studies scholars as a research framework. When using this method, scholars will assess a designed object and consider the physical and nonphysical interactions which revolve around the object. The scholar will analyze what the object’s impact is on psychological, societal, economical, and political worlds. This widened viewpoint allows the researcher to explore and map out the objects many interactions, identify its role within the network, and in what ways it is connected to stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Callon M. (1986) The Sociology of an Actor-Network: The Case of the Electric Vehicle. In: Callon M., Law J., Rip A. (eds) Mapping the Dynamics of Science and Technology. Palgrave Macmillan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semiotics, Rhetorical Analysis, and Discourse Theory  ===

Design Studies scholars may also analyze or research a designed object or system by studying it in terms of images and their various meanings. Based in [[representation (arts)|representation]] and meaning-making, semiotics as pertinent design as an act of communication between the designer, the thing, and the user or users. This concept branches out into a rhetorical analysis of the designed thing. Scholars such as [[Richard Buchanan (academic)|Richard Buchanan]], argue that design can be studied in such a way due to the existence of a design argument.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Richard|date=1985|title=Declaration by Design: Rhetoric, Argument, and Demonstration in Design Practice|url=|journal=Design Issues|volume=2|pages=4–22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The design argument is made up by the designer, the user, and the applicability to “practical life.”&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The scholar would pull these segments apart and thoroughly analyze each component and their interactions. Finally, [[discourse analysis]] or a [[Foucauldian discourse analysis]] can be adopted by the Design Studies scholar to further explore the above components. A Foucauldian approach specifically will analyze the power structures put in place, manipulated by, or used within a designed thing or object. This process can be particularly useful when the scholar intends to understand if the designed thing has agency or enables others to have agency.

In the field of [[computational chemistry]], '''energy minimization''' (also called '''energy optimization''', '''geometry minimization''', or '''geometry optimization''') is the process of finding an arrangement in space of a collection of atoms where, according to some computational model of chemical bonding, the net inter-atomic force on each atom is acceptably close to zero and the position on the [[potential energy surface]] (PES) is a stationary point (described later). The collection of atoms might be a single [[molecule]], an [[ion]], a [[condensed phase]], a [[transition state]] or even a collection of any of these. The computational model of chemical bonding might, for example, be quantum mechanics.

As an example, when optimizing the geometry of a [[Water (molecule)|water molecule]], one aims to obtain the hydrogen-oxygen bond lengths and the hydrogen-oxygen-hydrogen bond angle which minimize the forces that would otherwise be pulling atoms together or pushing them apart.

The motivation for performing a geometry optimization is the physical significance of the obtained structure: optimized structures often correspond to a substance as it is found in nature and the geometry of such a structure can be used in a variety of experimental and theoretical investigations in the fields of [[chemical structure]], [[thermodynamics]], [[chemical kinetics]], [[spectroscopy]] and others.

Typically, but not always, the process seeks to find the geometry of a particular arrangement of the atoms that represents a local or global energy minimum. Instead of searching for global energy minimum, it might be desirable to optimize to a [[transition state]], that is, a saddle point on the potential energy surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manual.cp2k.org/trunk/CP2K_INPUT/MOTION/GEO_OPT.html#desc_TYPE|title=Input reference of CP2K version trunk, Section GEO_OPT, Keyword TYPE|publisher=CP2K|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, certain coordinates (such as a chemical bond length) might be fixed during the optimization.

== Molecular geometry and mathematical interpretation ==

The geometry of a set of atoms can be described by a vector of the atoms' positions. This could be the set of the Cartesian coordinates of the atoms or, when considering molecules, might be so called ''internal coordinates'' formed from a set of bond lengths, bond angles and dihedral angles.

Given a set of atoms and a vector, {{math| '''r'''}}, describing the atoms' positions, one can introduce the concept of the energy as a function of the positions, {{math| ''E''('''r''')}}. Geometry optimization is then a [[mathematical optimization]] problem, in which it is desired to find the value of {{math| '''r'''}} for which {{math| ''E''('''r''')}} is at a [[local minimum]], that is, the derivative of the energy with respect to the position of the atoms, {{math| &amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;'''r'''}}, is the zero vector and the second derivative matrix of the system, {{math| &amp;part;&amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;''r''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;part;''r''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}}, also known as the [[Hessian matrix]], which describes the curvature of the PES at {{math| '''r'''}}, has all positive [[eigenvalues]] (is [[positive-definite matrix|positive definite]]).

A special case of a geometry optimization is a search for the geometry of a [[transition state]]; this is discussed below.

The computational model that provides an approximate {{math| ''E''('''r''')}} could be based on [[Quantum chemistry|quantum mechanics]] (using either [[density functional theory]] or [[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry method|semi-empirical methods]]), [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]], or a combination of those in case of [[QM/MM]]. Using this computational model and an initial guess (or [[ansatz]]) of the correct geometry, an iterative optimization procedure is followed, for example:

# calculate the force on each atom (that is, {{math| -&amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;'''r'''}})
# if the force is less than some threshold, '''finish'''
# otherwise, move the atoms by some computed step {{math|∆'''r'''}} that is predicted to reduce the force
# '''repeat '''from the start

== Practical aspects of optimization ==

As described above, some method such as quantum mechanics can be used to calculate the energy, {{math| ''E''('''r''') }}, the gradient of the PES, that is, the derivative of the energy with respect to the position of the atoms, {{math| &amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;'''r'''}} and the second derivative matrix of the system, {{math| &amp;part;&amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;''r''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;part;''r''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}}, also known as the [[Hessian matrix]], which describes the curvature of the PES at {{math| '''r'''}}.

An [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] algorithm can use some or all of {{math| ''E''('''r''') }}, {{math| &amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;'''r'''}} and {{math| &amp;part;&amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;''r''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;part;''r''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}} to try to minimize the forces and this could in theory be any method such as gradient descent, conjugate gradient or Newton's method, but in practice, algorithms which use knowledge of the PES curvature, that is the Hessian matrix, are found to be superior. For most systems of practical interest, however, it may be prohibitively expensive to compute the second derivative matrix, and it is estimated from successive values of the gradient, as is typical in a [[Quasi-Newton method|Quasi-Newton]] optimization.

The choice of the coordinate system can be crucial for performing a successful optimization. Cartesian coordinates, for example, are redundant since a non-linear molecule with {{math| ''N''}} atoms has {{math|3''N''–6}} vibrational [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] whereas the set of Cartesian coordinates has {{math|3''N''}} dimensions. Additionally, Cartesian coordinates are highly correlated, that is, the Hessian matrix has many non-diagonal terms that are not close to zero. This can lead to numerical problems in the optimization, because, for example, it is difficult to obtain a good approximation to the Hessian matrix and calculating it precisely is too computationally expensive. However, in case that energy is expressed with standard force fields, computationally efficient methods have been developed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chatzieleftheriou |first=S. |last2=Adendorff |first2=M. R. |last3=Lagaros |first3=N. D.  |year=2016 |title=Generalized Potential Energy Finite Elements for Modeling Molecular Nanostructures|journal=J. Chem. Inf. Model. |volume=56 |issue=10 |pages=1963–1978 |doi=10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00356}}&lt;/ref&gt; able to derive analytically the Hessian matrix in Cartesian coordinates while preserving a computational complexity of the same order to that of gradient computations. Internal coordinates tend to be less correlated but are more difficult to set-up and it can be difficult to describe some systems, such as ones with symmetry or large condensed phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peng|first=C. |last2=Ayala |first2=P. Y. |last3=Schlegel |first3=H. B. |year=1996 |title=Using Redundant Internal Coordinates to Optimize Equilibrium Geometries and Transition States|journal=Journal of Computational Chemistry |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=49–56 |doi=10.1002/(sici)1096-987x(19960115)17:1&lt;49::aid-jcc5&gt;3.3.co;2-#}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern computational chemistry software packages contain automatic procedures for the automatic generation of reasonable coordinate systems for optimization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaussian.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Degree of freedom restriction ===

Some degrees of freedom can be eliminated from an optimization, for example, positions of atoms or bond lengths and angles can be given fixed values. Sometimes these are referred to as being ''frozen'' degrees of freedom.

Figure 1 depicts a geometry optimization of the atoms in a carbon nanotube in the presence of an external electrostatic field. In this optimization, the atoms on the left have their positions frozen. Their interaction with the other atoms in the system are still calculated, but alteration the atoms' position during the optimization is prevented.

]]

== Transition state optimization ==

[[Transition state]] structures can be determined by searching for [[saddle points]] on the PES of the chemical species of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Computational Chemistry|publisher= John Wiley and Sons Ltd|location= England|year=1999|author= Frank Jensen}}&lt;/ref&gt; A first-order saddle point is a position on the PES corresponding to a minimum in all directions except one; a second-order saddle point is a minimum in all directions except two, and so on. Defined mathematically, an ''n''th order saddle point is characterized by the following:  {{math|1 = &amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;'''r''' = '''0'''}} and the Hessian matrix, {{math| &amp;part;&amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;''r''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;part;''r''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}}, has exactly ''n'' negative eigenvalues.

Algorithms to locate transition state geometries fall into two main categories: local methods and semi-global methods. Local methods are suitable when the starting point for the optimization is very close to the true transition state (''very close'' will be defined shortly) and semi-global methods find application when it is sought to locate the transition state with very little ''a priori'' knowledge of its geometry. Some methods, such as the Dimer method (see below), fall into both categories.

=== Local searches ===
A so-called local optimization requires an initial guess of the transition state that is very close to the true transition state. ''Very close'' typically means that the initial guess must have a  corresponding Hessian matrix with one negative eigenvalue, or, the negative eigenvalue corresponding to the reaction coordinate must be greater in magnitude than the other negative eigenvalues. Further, the eigenvector with the most negative eigenvalue must correspond to the reaction coordinate, that is, it must represent the geometric transformation relating to the process whose transition state is sought.

Given the above pre-requisites, a local optimization algorithm can then move "uphill" along the eigenvector with the most negative eigenvalue and "downhill" along all other degrees of freedom, using something similar to a quasi-Newton method.

=== Dimer method ===
The dimer method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A dimer method for finding saddle points on high dimensional potential surfaces using only first derivatives|journal= J. Chem. Phys. |volume=111 |year=1999| pages=7010–7022|author1=Graeme Henkelman |author2=Hannes Jónsson |doi=10.1063/1.480097|issue=15|bibcode = 1999JChPh.111.7010H }}
&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to find possible transition states without knowledge of the final structure or to refine a good guess of a transition structure. The “dimer” is formed by two images very close to each other on the PES. The method works by moving the dimer uphill from the starting position whilst rotating the dimer to find the direction of lowest curvature (ultimately negative).

&lt;/ref&gt; is also an open-ended method to find new transition states or to refine known saddle points on the PES. The method follows the direction of lowest negative curvature (computed using the [[Lanczos algorithm]]) on the PES to reach the saddle point, relaxing in the perpendicular hyperplane between each "jump" (activation) in this direction.

=== Chain-of-state methods ===
Chain-of-state&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, F. Introduction to Computational Chemistry; Wiley: 2 ed.; 2006&lt;/ref&gt; methods can be used to find the ''approximate'' geometry of the transition state based on the geometries of the reactant and product. The generated approximate geometry can then serve as a starting point for refinement via a local search, which was described above.

Chain-of-state methods use a series of vectors, that is points on the PES, connecting the reactant and product of the reaction of interest, {{math| '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;reactant&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math| '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;product&lt;/sub&gt;}}, thus discretizing the reaction pathway. Very commonly, these points are referred to as ''beads ''due to an analogy of a set of beads connected by strings or springs, which connect the reactant and products. The series of beads is often initially created by interpolating between {{math| '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;reactant&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math| '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;product&lt;/sub&gt;}}, for example, for a series of {{math|''N'' + 1}} beads, bead {{math|''i''}} might be given by

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_i = \frac{i}{N}\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{product} + \left(1 - \frac{i}{N} \right)\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{reactant}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''i'' &amp;isin; 0, 1, ..., ''N''}}. Each of the beads {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} has an energy, {{math| ''E''('''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and forces, {{math|-&amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and these are treated with a constrained optimization process that seeks to get an as accurate as possible representation of the reaction pathway. For this to be achieved, spacing constraints must be applied so that each bead {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} does not simply get optimized to the reactant and product geometry.

Often this constraint is achieved by [[Vector projection|projecting]] out components of the force on each bead {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, or alternatively the movement of each bead during optimization, that are tangential to the reaction path. For example, if for convenience, it is defined that {{math|1 = '''g'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, then the energy gradient at each bead minus the component of the energy gradient that is tangential to the reaction pathway is given by

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}_i^\perp = \mathbf{g}_i - \mathbf{\tau}_i(\mathbf{\tau}_i\cdot\mathbf{g}_i) = \left( I - \mathbf{\tau}_i \mathbf{\tau}_i^T \right)\mathbf{g}_i&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''I''}} is the identity matrix and {{math|'''τ'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a unit vector representing the reaction path tangent at {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. By projecting out components of the energy gradient  or the optimization step that are parallel to the reaction path, an optimization algorithm significantly reduces the tendency of each of the beads to be optimized directly to a minimum.

==== Synchronous transit ====
The simplest chain-of-state method is the linear synchronous transit (LST) method. It operates by taking interpolated points between the reactant and product geometries and choosing the one with the highest energy for subsequent refinement via a local search. The quadratic synchronous transit (QST) method extends LST by allowing a parabolic reaction path, with optimization of the highest energy point orthogonally to the parabola.

==== Nudged elastic band ====
In Nudged elastic band&lt;ref&gt;(a) G. Mills and H. Jónsson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 1124 (1994) (b) Graeme Henkelman and Hannes Jónsson, Improved tangent estimate in the nudged elastic band method for finding minimum energy paths and saddle points, J. Chem. Phys. 113, 9978 - 9985 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; method, the beads along the reaction pathway have simulated spring forces in addition to the chemical forces, {{math|-&amp;part;''E''/&amp;part;'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, to cause the optimizer to maintain the spacing constraint. Specifically, the force {{math|'''f'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} on each point ''i'' is given by

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}_i = \mathbf{f}_i^{\parallel} -\mathbf{g}_i^{\perp}&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}_i^{\parallel} = k\left[\left( \left(\mathbf{r}_{i+1} - \mathbf{r}_i\right) - \left(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_{i-1}\right)\right)\cdot\tau_i \right] \tau_i&lt;/math&gt;

is the spring force parallel to the pathway at each point {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} (''k'' is a spring constant and {{math|τ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, as before, is a unit vector representing the reaction path tangent at {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}).

In a traditional implementation, the point with the highest energy is used for subsequent refinement in a local search.There are many variations on the NEB (nudged elastic band) method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/vtsttools/neb/ |title=Nudged Elastic Band |work=UT Austin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203094132/http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/vtsttools/neb/ |archivedate=2014-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such including the climbing image NEB, in which the point with the highest energy is pushed upwards during the optimization procedure so as to (hopefully) give a geometry which is even closer to that of the transition state.

==== String method ====
The string method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.princeton.edu/string/index.html|title=Rare Events, Transition Pathways and Reaction Rates}} and {{Cite web|url = http://cims.nyu.edu/~eve2/string.htm |title = The string method page}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=String method for the study of rare Events|author= Weinan E, Weiqing Ren, [[Eric Vanden-Eijnden]]|journal=Phys. Rev. B|volume= 66|pages=052301 |year=2002|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.66.052301|issue=5|arxiv = cond-mat/0205527 |bibcode = 2002PhRvB..66e2301E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite  arXiv | title= Modified string method for finding minimum energy path|author1=Amit Samanta |author2=Weinan E |eprint=1009.5612}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses splines connecting the points, {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, to measure and enforce distance constraints between the points and to calculate the tangent at each point. In each step of an optimization procedure, the points might be moved according to the force acting on them perpendicular to the path, and then, if the equidistance constraint between the points is no-longer satisfied, the points can be redistributed, using the spline representation of the path to generate new vectors with the required spacing.

Variations on the string method include the growing string method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A growing string method for determining transition states: Comparison to the nudged elastic band and string methods|journal= J. Chem. Phys.|volume= 120 |year=2004|pages=7877–7886|author1=Baron Peters |author2=Andreas Heyden |author3=Alexis T. Bell |author4=Arup Chakraborty |doi=10.1063/1.1691018|pmid=15267702|issue=17|bibcode = 2004JChPh.120.7877P }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the guess of the pathway is grown in from the end points (that is the reactant and products) as the optimization progresses.

== Comparison with other techniques ==

Geometry optimization is fundamentally different from a [[molecular dynamics]] simulation. The latter simulates the motion of molecules with respect to time, subject to temperature, chemical forces, initial velocities, [[Brownian motion]] of a solvent, and so on, via the application of [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws of Motion]]. This means that the trajectories of the atoms which get computed, have some physical meaning. Geometry optimization, by contrast, does not produce a "trajectory" with any physical meaning – it is concerned with minimization of the forces acting on each atom in a collection of atoms, and the pathway via which it achieves this lacks meaning. Different optimization algorithms could give the same result for the minimum energy structure, but arrive at it via a different pathway.

'''Freshwater environmental quality parameters'''  are the natural and man-made [[chemical]], [[biology|biological]] and [[microbiology|microbiological]] characteristics of [[river]]s, [[lake]]s and [[ground-water]]s, the ways they are measured and the ways that they change. The values or concentrations attributed to such [[Parameter#Environmental science|parameters]] can be used to describe the pollution status of an environment, its biotic status or to predict the likelihood or otherwise of a particular organisms  being present. Monitoring of environmental quality parameters is a key activity in managing the environment, restoring polluted environments and anticipating the effects of man-made changes on the environment.

'''Freshwater environmental quality parameters''' are those  chemical, physical or biological parameters that can be used to characterise a freshwater body. Because almost all water bodies are dynamic in their composition, the relevant quality parameters are typically expressed as a range of expected concentrations.

==Characterisation==
{{see also|water chemistry analysis}}
The first step in understanding the chemistry of freshwater is to establish the relevant concentrations of the parameters of interest. Conventionally this is done by taking representative samples of the water for subsequent analysis in a laboratory . However, in-situ monitoring using hand-held analytical equipment or using bank-side monitoring stations are also used.

===Sampling===
Freshwaters are surprisingly difficult to sample because they are rarely [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] and their quality varies during the day and during the year. In addition the most representative sampling locations are often at a distance from the shore or bank increasing the logistic complexity.

====Rivers====
Filling a clean bottle with river water is a very simple task, but a single sample is only representative of that point along the river the sample was taken from and at that point in time. Understanding the chemistry of a whole river, or even a significant tributary, requires prior investigation to understand how homogeneous or mixed the flow is and to determine if the quality changes during the course of a day and during the course of a year. Almost all natural rivers will have very significant patterns of change through the day and through the seasons. [[Water remote sensing]] offers a spatially continuous tool to improve understanding of spatial and temporal river water quality. Many rivers also have a very large flow that is unseen. This flows through underlying gravel and sand layers and is called [[hyporheic zone|hyporheic flow]]. How much mixing there is between the hyporheic zone and the water in the open channel will depend on a variety of factors, some of which relate to flows leaving [[aquifers]] which may have been storing water for many years.

===Ground-waters===
Ground waters by their very nature  are often very difficult to access to take a sample. As a consequence the majority of ground-water data comes from samples taken from [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s, [[water well|well]]s, water supply bore-holes and in natural [[cave]]s. In recent decades as the need to understand ground water dynamics has increased, an increasing number or monitoring bore-holes have been drilled into aquifers

===Lakes===

''see also [[Limnology]]''

Lakes  and ponds can be very large  and support a complex  eco-system in which environmental parameters vary widely in all three physical dimensions and with time. Large lakes in the temperate zone often stratify in the warmer months into a warmer upper layers rich in oxygen and a colder lower layer with low oxygen levels. In the autumn, falling temperatures and  occasional high winds result in the mixing of the two layers into a more homogeneous whole. When stratification occurs it not only affects oxygen levels but also many related parameters such as [[iron]], [[phosphate]] and [[manganese]] which are all changed in their chemical form by change in the [[redox]] potential of the environment.

Lakes also receive waters, often from many different sources with varying qualities. Solids from stream inputs will typically settle near the mouth of the stream and depending on a variety of factors the incoming water may float over the surface of the lake, sink beneath the surface or rapidly mix with the lake water. All of these phenomena can  skew the results of any environmental monitoring unless the process are well understood.

==Mixing zones==
Where two rivers meet at a confluence there exists a mixing zone. A mixing zone may be very large and extend for many miles as in the case of the [[Mississippi]] and [[Missouri]] rivers in the [[United States]] and the [[River Clwyd]] and [[River Elwy]] in [[North Wales]]. In a mixing zone water chemistry may be very variable and can be difficult to predict. The chemical interactions are not just simple mixing but may be complicated by biological processes from submerged [[macrophyte]]s and by water joining the channel from the [[hyporheic]] zone or from springs draining an aquifer.

==Geological inputs==
The geology that underlies a river or lake has a major impact on its chemistry. A river flowing across very ancient [[precambrian]] [[schists]] is likely to have dissolved very little from the rocks and maybe similar to de-ionised water at least in the headwaters. Conversely a river flowing through [[chalk]] hills, and especially if its source is in the chalk, will have a high concentration of [[carbonate]]s and [[bicarbonate]]s of [[Calcium]] and possibly [[Magnesium]].

As a river progresses along its course it may pass through a variety of geological types and it may have inputs from aquifers that do not appear on the surface anywhere in the locality.

==Atmospheric inputs==
Oxygen is probably the most important chemical constituent of surface water chemistry, as all [[aerobic organism]]s require it for survival.  It enters the water mostly via diffusion at the water-air interface.  Oxygen’s solubility in water decreases as water temperature increases. Fast, turbulent streams expose more of the water’s surface area to the air and tend to have low temperatures and thus more oxygen than slow, backwaters.  Oxygen is a by-product of photosynthesis, so systems with a high abundance of aquatic algae and plants may also have high concentrations of oxygen during the day.  These levels can decrease significantly during the night when primary producers switch to respiration.  Oxygen can be limiting if circulation between the surface and deeper layers is poor, if the activity of animals is very high, or if there is a large amount of organic decay occurring such as following Autumn leaf-fall.

Most other atmospheric inputs come from man-made or [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] sources the most significant of which are the oxides of sulphur produced by burning sulphur rich fuels such as [[coal]] and [[oil]] which give rise to [[acid rain]].&lt;ref&gt;Likens, G. E., W. C. Keene, J. M. Miller and J. N. Galloway.  1987.  Chemistry of precipitation from a remote, terrestrial site in Australia.  J. Geophys. Res. 92(D11):13,299-13,314.&lt;/ref&gt; The chemistry of sulphur oxides is complex both in the [[atmosphere]] and in river systems. However the effect on the overall chemistry is simple in that it reduces the pH of the water making it more acidic. The pH change is most marked in rivers with very low concentrations of dissolved salts as these cannot [[Buffer solution|buffer]] the effects of the acid input. Rivers downstream of major industrial conurbations are also at greatest risk. In parts of [[Scandinavia]] and [[West Wales]] and [[Scotland]] many rivers became so acidic from oxides of sulphur that most fish life was destroyed and pHs as low as pH4 were recorded  during critical weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Air pollution, acid rain, and the environment. Kenneth Mellanby, Watt Committee on Energy, Springer, 1988 {{ISBN|1-85166-222-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-85166-222-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropogenic inputs==
The majority of rivers on the planet and many lakes have received or are receiving inputs from human-kind's activities. In the industrialised world, many rivers have been very seriously polluted, at least during the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries. Although in general there has been much improvement in the developed world, there is still a great deal of river pollution apparent on the planet.

==Toxicity==
In most environmental situations the presence or absence of an organism is determined by a complex web of interactions only some of which will be related to measurable chemical or biological parameters. Flow rate, turbulence, inter and intra specific competition, feeding behaviour, [[disease]], [[parasite|parasatism]], [[commensalism]] and [[symbiosis]] are just a few of the pressures and opportunities facing any organism or population. Most chemical constituents favour some organisms and are less favourable to others. However, there are some cases where a chemical constituent exerts a toxic effect. i.e. where the concentration can kill or severely inhibit the normal functioning of the organism. Where a toxic effect has been demonstrated this may be noted in the sections below dealing with the individual parameters.

==Chemical constituents==

===Colour and turbidity===
Often it is the colour of freshwater or how clear or hazy the water is that is the most obvious visual characteristic. Unfortunately neither colour nor turbidity are strong indicators of the overall chemical composition of water. However both colour and turbidity reduce the amount of light penetrating the water and can have significant impact on algae and macrophytes. Some algae in particular are highly dependent on water with low colour and turbidity

Many rivers draining high moor-lands overlain by [[peat]] have a very deep yellow brown colour caused by dissolved [[humic acid]]s.

===Organic constituents===

One of the principal sources of elevated concentrations of organic chemical constituents is from treated sewage.
{{main|Sewage treatment}}

Dissolved organic material is most commonly measured using either the [[Biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) test or the [[Chemical oxygen demand]] (COD) test. Organic constituents are significant in river chemistry for the effect that they have on dissolved oxygen concentration and for the impact that individual organic species may have directly on aquatic biota.

Any organic and degradable material consumes oxygen as it decomposes. Where organic concentrations are significantly elevated the effects on oxygen concentrations can be significant and as conditions get extreme the river bed may become [[anoxic waters|anoxic]].

Some organic constituents such as synthetic [[hormone]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[phthalate]]s have direct metabolic effects on aquatic biota and even on humans drinking water taken from the river. Understanding such constituents and how they can be identified and quantified is becoming of increasing importance in the understanding of freshwater chemistry.

===Metals===
A wide range of metals may be found in rivers from natural sources where metal ores are present in the rocks over which the river flows or in the aquifers feeding water into the river. However many rivers have an increased load of metals because of industrial activities which include mining and quarrying and the processing and use of metals.

====Iron====
Iron, usually as Fe&lt;sup&gt;+++&lt;/sup&gt; is a common constituent of river waters at very low levels. Higher iron concentrations in acidic springs or an anoxic hyporheic zone may cause visible orange/brown staining or semi-gelatinous precipitates of dense orange [[iron bacteria]]l [[Flocculation|floc]] carpeting the river bed. Such conditions are very deleterious to most organisms and can cause serious damage in a river system.

Coal mining is also a very significant source of  Iron both in mine-waters and from stocking yards of coal and from coal processing. Long abandoned mines can be a highly intractable source of high concentrations of Iron.
Low levels of iron are common in spring waters emanating from deep-seated aquifers and maybe regarding as health giving springs. Such springs are commonly called [[Chalybeate]] springs and have given rise to a number of [[Spa]] towns in Europe and the United States.

====Zinc====
[[Zinc]] is normally associated with metal mining, especially Lead and Silver mining but is also a component pollutant associated with a variety of other metal mining activities and with [[Coal mining]]. Zinc is toxic at relatively low concentrations to many aquatic organisms. ''Microregma'' starts to show a toxic reaction at concentrations as low as 0.33&amp;nbsp;mg/l &lt;ref&gt;Bringmann G. and Kuhn R., 1959, The toxic effects of waste water on aquatic bacteria, algae and small crustaceans, Gesund Ing 80, 115&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heavy metals====
Lead and silver in river waters are commonly found together and associated with  lead mining. Impacts from very old mines can be very long-lived. In the [[River Ystwyth]] in [[Wales]] for example, the effects of silver and lead mining in the 17th and 18th centuries in the headwaters still causes unacceptably high levels of Zinc and [[Lead]] in the river water right down to its confluence with the sea. 
[[Silver]] is very toxic even at very low concentrations but leaves no visible evidence of its contamination.

Lead is also highly toxic to freshwater organisms and to humans if the water is used as drinking water. As with Silver, Lead pollution is not visible to the naked eye. The [[River Rheidol]] in west Wales had a major series of lead mines in its headwaters until the end of the 19th century and its mine discharges and waste tips remain to this day. In 1919 - 1921  only 14 species of invertebrates were found in the lower Rheidol when Lead concentrations were between 0.2ppm and 0.5ppm. By 1932 the lead concentration had reduced to 0.02ppm to 0.1ppm because of the abandonment of mining and, at those concentrations, the bottom fauna had stabilized to 103 species including three [[leech]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie, R.D. and Jones, J.R.E., 1938, The faunistic recovery of a lead polluted river in north Cardiganshire, Wales, J. Anim. Ecol, 7, 272 -286&lt;/ref&gt;

Coal mining is also a very significant source of metals, especially Iron, Zinc and [[Nickel]] particularly where the coal is rich if [[pyrites]] which oxidises on contact with the air producing a very acidic [[leachate]] which is able to dissolve metals from the coal.

Significant levels of copper are unusual in rivers and where it does it occur the source is most likely to be mining activities, coal stocking, or [[pig]] farming. Rarely elevated levels may be of geological origin. Copper is acutely toxic to many freshwater organisms, especially algae, at very low concentrations and significant concentration in river water may have serious adverse effects on the local ecology.

===Nitrogen===
Nitrogenous compounds have a variety of sources including washout of oxides of nitrogen from the atmosphere, some geological inputs and some from macrophyte and [[algae|algal]] [[nitrogen fixation]]. However, for many rivers in the proximity of humans, the largest input is from sewage whether treated or untreated. The nitrogen derives from breakdown products of [[protein]]s found in [[urine]] and [[faeces]]. These products, being very soluble, often pass through sewage treatment process and are discharged into rivers as a component of [[sewage treatment]] effluent. Nitrogen may be in the form of [[nitrate]], [[nitrite]], [[ammonia]] or ammonium salts or what is termed albuminoid nitrogen or nitrogen still within an organic proteinoid molecule.

The differing forms of nitrogen are relatively stable in most river systems with nitrite slowly transforming into nitrate in well oxygenated rivers and ammonia transforming into nitrite/ nitrate. However, the process are slow in cool rivers and reduction in concentration may more often be attributed to simple dilution. All forms of nitrogen are taken up by macrophytes and algae and elevated levels of nitrogen are often associated with overgrowths of plants or [[eutrophication]]. These can have the effect of blocking channels and inhibiting [[navigation]]. However, ecologically, the more significant effect is on dissolved oxygen concentrations which may become super-saturated during daylight due to plant [[photosynthesis]] but then drop to very low levels during darkness as plant respiration uses up the dissolved oxygen. Coupled with the release of oxygen in photosynthesis is the creation of bi-carbonate ions which cause a steep rise in pH and this is matched in darkness as [[carbon dioxide]] is released through respiration which substantially lowers the pH. Thus high levels of nitrogenous compounds tends to lead to eutrophication with extreme variations in parameters which in turn can substantially degrade the ecological worth of the watercourse.

Ammonium ions also have a toxic effect, especially on [[fish]]. The toxicity of ammonia is dependent on both pH and temperature  and an added complexity is the buffering effect of the blood/water interface across the [[gill]] [[Biological membrane|membrane]] which masks any additional toxicity over about pH 8.0. The management of river chemistry to avoid ecological damage is particularly difficult in the case of ammonia as a wide range of potential scenarios of concentration, pH and temperature have to be considered and the diurnal pH fluctuation caused by photosynthesis considered. On warm summer days with high-bi-carbonate concentrations unexpectedly toxic conditions can be created.

===Phosphorus===
[[Phosphorus]] compounds are usually found as relatively insoluble phosphates in river water and, except in some exceptional circumstances, their origin is [[agriculture]] or human sewage. Phosphorus can encourage excessive growths of plants and algae and contribute to [[eutrophication]]. If a river discharges into a lake or reservoir phosphate can be mobilised year after year by natural processes. In the summer time, lakes stratify so that warm oxygen rich water floats on top of cold oxygen poor water. In the warm upper layers - the [[epilimnion]]- plants consume the available phosphate. As the plants die in the late summer they fall into the cool water layers underneath - the [[hypolimnion]] - and decompose. During winter turn-over, when a lake becomes fully mixed through the action of winds on a cooling body of water - the phosphates are spread throughout the lake again to feed a new generation of plants. This process is one of the principal causes of persistent [[algal bloom]]s at some lakes.

===Arsenic===
Geological deposits of arsenic may be released into rivers where deep ground-waters are exploited as in parts of [[Pakistan]]. Many metalloid ores such as lead, gold and [[copper]] contain traces of arsenic and poorly stored tailings may result in arsenic entering the [[hydrological cycle]].

===Solids===
Inert solids are produced in all montane rivers as the energy of the water helps grind away rocks into gravel, sand and finer material. Much of this settles very quickly and provides an important substrate for many aquatic organisms. Many [[salmon]]id fish require beds of gravel and sand in which to lay their eggs.
Many other types of solids from agriculture, mining, quarrying, urban run-off and sewage may block-out sunlight from the river and may block interstices in gravel beds making them useless for spawning and supporting insect life.

===Bacterial, viral and parasite inputs===
Both agriculture and sewage treatment produce  inputs into rivers with very high concentrations of [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[virus]]es including a wide range of [[pathogen]]ic organisms. Even in areas with little human activity significant levels of bacteria and viruses can be detected originating from fish and aquatic mammals and from animals grazing near rivers such as [[deer]].
Upland waters draining areas frequented by [[sheep]], [[goats]] or deer may also harbour a variety of opportunistic human parasites such as [[liver fluke]]. Consequently, there are very few rivers from which the water is safe to drink without some form of sterilisation or disinfection. In rivers used for contact recreation such as swimming, safe levels of bacteria and viruses can be established based on risk assessment.

Under certain conditions bacteria can colonise freshwaters occasionally making large rafts of filamentous mats known as ''sewage fungus'' – usually ''[[Sphaerotilus natans]]''. The presence of such organisms is almost always an indicator of extreme [[Organic compound|organic pollution]] and would be expected to be matched with low dissolved oxygen concentrations and high BOD vales.

[[E. coli]] bacteria have been commonly found in recreational waters and their presence is used to indicate the presence of recent faecal contamination, but E. coli presence may not be indicative of human waste. '' E. coli'' are found in all warm-blooded animals.  ''E. coli''  have also been found in  fish and turtles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~rhicks/lab/Hansen%20et%20al%202008%20JGLR%2034.pdf|title=Sources and Sinks of ''Escherichia coli'' in Benthic and Pelagic Fish|publisher=Internat. Assoc. Great Lakes Res|date=2008|author1= John J. Clark|author2= Satoshi Ishii|author3=Michael J. Sadowsky|author4=Randall E. Hicks|access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Enterobacteria]] may also persist in the environment in mud, sediments, sand and soil for considerable lengths of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~rhicks/lab/Ksoll%20et%20al%202007%20AEM%2073.pdf|title=Presence and Sources of Faecal Coliform Bacteria in Epilithic Periphyton Communities of Lake Superior|publisher= American Society for Microbiology|date=2007|access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===pH===
pH in rivers is affected by the geology of the water source, atmospheric inputs and a range of other chemical contaminants. pH is only likely to become an issue on very poorly buffered upland rivers where atmospheric sulphur and nitrogen oxides may very significantly depress the pH as low as pH4 or in eutrophic alkaline rivers where photosynthetic bi-carbonate ion production in photosynthesis may drive the pH up above pH10

'''gravitySimulator''' is a novel [[supercomputer]] that incorporates special-purpose [[Gravity Pipe|GRAPE]] hardware to solve the gravitational [[N-body problem|''n''-body problem]].  It is housed in the [[Center for Computational Relativity and Gravitation]] (CCRG) at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]. It became operational in 2005. 

[[Image:gravitySimulator.jpg|thumb|gravitySimulator]]

The computer consists of 32 nodes, each of which contains a GRAPE-6A board ("mini-GRAPE") in a [[Peripheral Component Interconnect]] (PCI) slot.&lt;ref&gt;S. Harfst ''et al.'' (2007), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007NewA...12..357H  Performance analysis of direct ''N''-body algorithms on special-purpose supercomputers], ''New Astronomy'', '''12''', 357&lt;/ref&gt; The GRAPE boards use pipelines to compute pairwise forces between particles at a speed of 130 [[gigaflop|Gflop]]s. 
The on-board memory of each GRAPE board can hold data for 128,000 particles, and by combining 32 of them in a cluster, a total of four million particles can be integrated, at sustained speeds of 4[[teraflop|Tflop]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpcwire.com/offthewire/17874824.html  RIT's gravitySimulator Among the Fastest] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130126065150/http://www.hpcwire.com/offthewire/17874824.html |date=2013-01-26 }}, HPCwire, July 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  

gravitySimulator is used to study the dynamical evolution of [[galaxies]] and [[galactic nuclei]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Berczik ''et al''.

The scale is such that the fine grains of light represent collections of large numbers of [[supercluster]]s. The [[Virgo Supercluster]] - home of [[Milky Way|our own galaxy]] - is at the center of our Hubble volume, but is too small to be seen in the image.]]

In [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]], a '''Hubble volume''' or '''Hubble sphere''' is a spherical region of the [[observable universe]] surrounding an observer beyond which objects recede from that observer at a rate greater than the [[speed of light]] due to the expansion of the [[Universe]].&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;{{cite book |title=Masks of the Universe |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tSowGCP0kMIC&amp;pg=PA206 |page=206 |author= Edward Robert Harrison |date=2003 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-77351-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hubble volume is approximately equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; cubic light years.

The [[comoving distance|proper]] radius of a Hubble sphere (known as the Hubble radius or the [[Hubble length]]) is &lt;math&gt;c/H_0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] and &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble constant]]. The surface of a Hubble sphere is called the ''microphysical horizon'',&lt;ref name= Montani&gt;{{cite journal |title=Study of the Quasi-isotropic Solution near the Cosmological Singularity in Presence of Bulk-Viscosity |author= N. Carlevaro &amp; G. Montani |arxiv=0711.1952 |date=2009 |doi=10.1142/S0218271808012553 |volume=17 |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |pages=881–896|bibcode = 2008IJMPD..17..881C }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Hubble surface'', or the ''Hubble limit''.

More generally, the term "Hubble volume" can be applied to any region of space with a volume of order &lt;math&gt;(c/H_0)^3&lt;/math&gt;.  
However, the term is also frequently (but mistakenly) used as a [[synonym]] for the [[observable universe]]; the latter is larger than the Hubble volume.&lt;ref name= Davis&gt;For a discussion of why objects that are outside the Earth's Hubble sphere can be seen from Earth, see  {{cite journal |title=Expanding Confusion: common misconceptions of cosmological horizons and the superluminal expansion of the universe |author= TM Davis &amp; CH Linewater |arxiv=astro-ph/0310808 |date=2003 |doi=10.1071/AS03040 |volume=21 |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia |pages=97–109|bibcode = 2004PASA...21...97D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an example of mistaken usage, see {{cite book |author=Max Tegmark |authorlink=Max Tegmark |chapter=Parallel Universes |title=Science and Ultimate Reality: From Quantum to Cosmos |editor-last=Barrow |editor-first=J.

==Relationship to age of the universe==

The Hubble length &lt;math&gt;c/H_0&lt;/math&gt; is 14 billion light years in the [[Lambda-CDM model|standard cosmological model]], somewhat larger than &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; times the [[age of the universe]], 13.8 billion years.

==Hubble limit as an event horizon==

For objects at the Hubble limit the space between us and the object of interest has an average expansion speed of ''c''. So, in a universe with constant [[Hubble parameter]], light emitted at the present time by objects outside the Hubble limit would never be seen by an observer on Earth. 
That is, the Hubble limit would coincide with a cosmological [[event horizon]] (a boundary separating events visible at some time and those that are never visible&lt;ref name=Harrison2&gt;{{cite book |author=Edward Robert Harrison |page=439 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-8PJbcA2lLoC&amp;pg=PA439 |title=Masks of the Universe |isbn=0-521-66148-X |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;). See [[List of cosmological horizons#Hubble horizon|Hubble horizon]] for more details.

However, the [[Hubble parameter]] is not constant in various cosmological models&lt;ref name= Davis/&gt; so that the Hubble limit does not, in general, coincide with a cosmological event horizon. For example in a decelerating [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann universe]] the Hubble sphere expands with time, and its boundary overtakes light emitted by more distant galaxies so that light emitted at earlier times by objects ''outside'' the Hubble sphere still may eventually arrive inside the sphere and be seen by us.&lt;ref name= Davis/&gt; Conversely, in an accelerating universe, the Hubble sphere shrinks with time, and its boundary overtakes light emitted by nearer galaxies so that light emitted at earlier times by objects ''inside'' the Hubble sphere will eventually recede outside the sphere and will never be seen by us.&lt;ref name=Harrison/&gt;

Observations indicate that the expansion of the universe is [[accelerating universe|accelerating]],&lt;ref name="Tonry"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Cosmological Results from High-z Supernovae|date = 2003|arxiv = astro-ph/0305008|author = John L Tonry|journal = Astrophys J|volume = 594|bibcode = 2003ApJ...594....1T|doi = 10.1086/376865|display-authors = 1|last2 = Schmidt|first2 = Brian P.|last3 = Barris|first3 = Brian|last4 = Candia|first4 = Pablo|last5 = Challis|first5 = Peter|last6 = Clocchiatti|first6 = Alejandro|last7 = Coil|first7 = Alison L.|last8 = Filippenko|first8 = Alexei V.|last9 = Garnavich|first9 = Peter|pages = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that some objects that we can currently exchange signals with will one day cross our Hubble limit.

'''Human evolutionary developmental biology''' or informally '''human evo-devo''' is the human-specific subset of [[evolutionary developmental biology]]. Evolutionary developmental biology is the study of the evolution of [[developmental process]]es across different organisms. It is utilized within multiple disciplines, primarily evolutionary biology and [[anthropology]]. Groundwork for the theory that "evolutionary modifications in [[primate]] development might have led to … modern humans" was laid by [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Ernst Haeckel]], [[Louis Bolk]], and Adolph Schultz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Mitteroecker | first=Philipp | last2=Bookstein | first2=Fred | date=2008-04-01 | title=The Evolutionary Role of Modularity and Integration in the Hominoid Cranium | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00321.x/abstract | journal=Evolution | volume=62 | issue=4 | pages=943–958 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00321.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary developmental biology is primarily concerned with the ways in which evolution affects development,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Müller | first=Gerd B. | title=Evo–devo: extending the evolutionary synthesis | url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrg2219 | journal=Nature Reviews Genetics | volume=8 | issue=12 | pages=943–949 | doi=10.1038/nrg2219}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seeks to unravel the causes of evolutionary innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Guinard | first=Geoffrey | date=2012-12-01 | title=Evolutionary concepts meet the neck of penguins (Aves: Sphenisciformes), towards a "survival strategy" for evolutionary developmental biology | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12064-012-0156-1 | journal=Theory in Biosciences | volume=131 | issue=4 | pages=231–242 | doi=10.1007/s12064-012-0156-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach is relatively new, but has roots in Schultz's ''The physical distinctions of man,'' from the 1940s. Shultz urged broad comparative studies to identify uniquely human traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schultz | first=Adolph H. | year=1950 | title=The physical distinctions of Man | journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume=94 | issue=5 | pp=428–449 |jstor=3143610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Brian Hall traces the roots of evolutionary developmental biology in his 2012 paper on its past present and future. He begins with [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] evolution and [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]]'s genetics, noting the tendency of the followers of both men in the early 20th century to follow separate paths and to set aside and ignore apparently inexplicable problems.&lt;ref name="Hall 2012"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://evolution-outreach.springeropen.com/ | title=Evolution: Education and Outreach | website=Evolution: Education and Outreach | doi=10.1007/s12052-012-0418-x | access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater understanding of genotypic and phenotypic structures from the 1940s enabled the unification of evolution and genetics in the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]. [[Molecular biology]] then enabled researchers to explore the mechanisms and evolution of embryonic development in molecular detail, including in humans.&lt;ref name="Hall 2012" /&gt;

== Human and primate development ==
Many of the human evolutionary developmental biology studies have been modeled after primate studies and consider the two together in a comparative model. Brain ontogeny and human life history evolution were looked at by Leigh, in a 2006 paper. He compares brain growth patterns for ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' to get at the evolution of brain size and weight. Leigh found three different patterns, all of which pointed to the growth rate of ''H. erectus'' either matching or exceeding ''H. erectus''.&lt;ref name="Leigh 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Leigh | first=Steven R. | date=2012-12-01 | title=Brain Size Growth and Life History in Human Evolution | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11692-012-9168-5 | journal=Evolutionary Biology | language=en | volume=39 | issue=4 | pages=587–599 | doi=10.1007/s11692-012-9168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He makes the case that this finding had wide application and relevance t the overall study of human evolution. It is pertinent specifically to the connections between energy expenditure and brain development. These finding are of specific utility in studies on maternal energy expenditure.&lt;ref name="Leigh 2012" /&gt; Comparative study of nonhuman primates, fossils and modern humans to study patterns of brain growth to correlate human life history and brain growth.&lt;ref name="Leigh 2012" /&gt;

Jeremy De Silva and Julie Lesnik examined chimpanzee neonatal brain size to identify implications for brain growth in ''Homo erectus''. This changed the understanding of differences and similarities of post-natal brain growth in humans and [[chimpanzee]]s. The study found that there was a distinction necessary between growth time and growth rate.The times of growth were strikingly similar, but the rates were not. The paper further advocates the use of fossils to assess brain size in general and in relation to cranial capacity.&lt;ref name="DeSilva 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Cofran | first=Zachary | last2=DeSilva | first2=Jeremy M. | date=2015-04-01 | title=A neonatal perspective on Homo erectus brain growth | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248415000445 | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=81 | pages=41–47 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2015.02.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilization of endocranial volume as a measure for brain size has been a popular methodology with the fossil record since [[Darwinism | Darwin]] in the mid 1800s. This measure has been used to access the metabolic requirements for brain growth and the subsequent trade-offs.

=== Neoteny ===
Some of the work on human evolutionary developmental biology has centered around the [[Neoteny | neotenous]] features that present in humans, but are not shared across the primate spectrum. [[Stephen Jay Gould | Steven J. Gould]] discussed the presentation of neoteny with "terminal additions" in humans.{{sfn|Gould|1977|pp= }} Neoteny is defined as the delayed or slowed development in humans when compared with their non-human primate counterparts. The "terminal additions" were extensions or reductions in the rate and scope of stages of development and growth.{{sfn|Gould|1977|pp= }}{{pages needed|date=May 2017}} Gould hypothesized that this process and production of neoteny in humans might be the key feature that ultimately lead to the emotional and communicative nature of humans. He credits this factor as an integral facet of human evolution. However, there have also been cautions against the application of this aspect to group ranking during it inappropriate as a measure of evolutionary achievement.&lt;ref name="Pievani 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=JASs | url=http://www.isita-org.com/jass/Contents/ContentsVol90.htm | doi=10.4436/jass.90016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fossil record ===

Early comparative and human studies examined the fossil record to measure features like cranial sizes and capacities so as to infer brain size, growth rate, total growth and potential implications for energy expenditure. Helpful as this is, the static nature of individual fossils presents its own challenge. The phylogenic fossil line is itself a hypothesis, so anything based upon it is equally hypothetical.&lt;ref name="McNulty 2005" /&gt;

Using the fossil record of Neanderthals, modern humans, and chimpanzees, Gunz et al. examined that patterns of endocranial development.&lt;ref name="Gunz 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Gunz | first=Philipp | last2=Neubauer | first2=Simon | last3=Golovanova | first3=Lubov | last4=Doronichev | first4=Vladimir | last5=Maureille | first5=Bruno | last6=Hublin | first6=Jean-Jacques | year=2012 | title=A uniquely modern human pattern of endocranial development.

They concluded that even though much of the developmental results are similar insofar as brain size, the trajectories by which they arrived are not shared. Most of the differences between the two arise post-natally, in the first year, with cognitive development.&lt;ref name="Gunz 2012" /&gt;

There have been a number of studies that not only take incomplete fossil records into consideration, but have attempt to specifically identify the barriers presented by this condition. For example, Kieran McNulty covers the potential utilities and constraints of using incomplete fossil taxa to examine longitudinal development in Australopithecus africanis.&lt;ref name="McNulty 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=McNulty | first=Kieran P. | date=2012-12-01 | title=Evolutionary Development in Australopithecus africanus | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11692-012-9172-9 | journal=Evolutionary Biology | volume=39 | issue=4 | pages=488–498 | doi=10.1007/s11692-012-9172-9 | issn=0071-3260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies on development have been human-specific. In his 2011 paper, Bernard Crespi focused on adaptation and genomic conflict in childhood diseases. He considers the evolution of childhood diseases and their risk levels, and finds that both risk and disease have evolved.&lt;ref name="Crespi 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Crespi | first=Bernard | date=2011-05-22 | title=The evolutionary biology of child health | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/278/1711/1441 | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences | language=en | volume=278 | issue=1711 | pages=1441–1449 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.2627 | pmc=3081756 | pmid=21288946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotchberg and Belsky incorporate a life-history perspective, looking at adolescence. Substantial variation in phenotypic paths and presentations suggest significant environmental influence. They focus on plasticity between stages of development and the factors that shape it. Rate of maturation, fecundity, and fertility were all impacted by environmental circumstances. They argue that early maturation can be positive, reflecting opportunistic actions within specific conditions.&lt;ref name="Belsky 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Hochberg | first=Ze'ev | last2=Belsky | first2=Jay | date=2013-04-29 | title=evolutionary developmental biology of human adolescence: beyond disease models of early puberty | url=http://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-11-113 | journal=BMC Medicine | volume=11 | issue=1 | pages=113 | doi=10.1186/1741-7015-11-113 | pmc=3639027 | pmid=23627891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic and epigenetic basis ==

Technological advances that have allowed better and better access to the growth of the human form in utero have proven particularly formative in studies involving focus on genetic and epigenetic development. Bakker et al. look at the interconnected nature of developmental processes and attempt to use fetal vertebral abnormalities as an indicator for other malformations. They found that the origin of the cells was not nearly as highly correlated as the observed developmental signals.&lt;ref name="Broek 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Broek | first=Clara M.

Freiston and Galis look at the development of ribs, digits, and mammalian asymmetry. They argue that this construction is relevant for the study of disease, the consistency in evolution of body plans, and understanding of developmental constraints.&lt;ref name="Galis 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Galis | first=Frietson | last2=Broek | first2=Clara M.

== Language and cognitive studies ==

Languages and cognitive function have also been subjects of evolutionary studies. Insofar as language and evolutionary developmental biology, there is tension from the gate. Much of this contention has centered around whether to view and study language as an adaptation in and of its self, or as a by-product of other adaptations. Jackendoff and Pinker have argued for language as an adaptation owing to the interdependent social nature of humans. To support these claims, he points to things like the bi-directionality in language usage and comprehension.&lt;ref name="Jackendoff 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Jackendoff | first=Ray | last2=Pinker | first2=Steven | date=2005-09-01 | title=The nature of the language faculty and its implications for evolution of language (Reply to Fitch, Hauser, and Chomsky) | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027705000879 | journal=Cognition | volume=97 | issue=2 | pages=211–225 | doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2005.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a counter to the claims by theorists like [[Noam Chomsky]], who argued against language as a human specific adaptation.&lt;ref name="Chomsky 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Fitch | first=W. Tecumseh | last2=Hauser | first2=Marc D. | last3=Chomsky | first3=Noam | date=2005-09-01 | title=The evolution of the language faculty: Clarifications and implications | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027705000867 | journal=Cognition | volume=97 | issue=2 | pages=179–210 | doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2005.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptation and adaptive theory has been argued even separate from its utility in the study of language. Gould and Lewontin engage with what they saw as flaws in adaptive theory using the analogy of the [[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]s of San Marco. Among the issues identified is the lack of distinction between what trait developed and how it is used, and the underlying reasons or forces that created the novel trait initially.&lt;ref name="Gould 1979"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Gould | first=S. J. | last2=Lewontin | first2=R. C. | date=1979-09-21 | title=The spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian paradigm: a critique of the adaptationist programme | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume=205 | issue=1161 | pages=581–598 | pmid=42062}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly difficult to access in intangible language and cognition.

This debate has continued over decades and most often presents in the form of a response and published dialogue between theorists. This continued debate has prompted efforts to marry the two perspectives in a useful way. Fitch argues that these two approaches can be rectified with the study of "neutral computation and mammalian brain development".&lt;ref name="Fitch 2009" /&gt; It may be more useful to consider specific components of neural computation and development, what has been selected for, and to what end.&lt;ref name="Fitch 2009"&gt;{{Cite conference | first=Tecumseh | last=Fitch | date=3–6 September 2009 | url=http://www.kli.ac.at/download/KLIreport2009.pdf | title=Skyhooks and Spandrels: What can Evo-Devo tell about the evolution of syntax | website=www.kli.ac.at | conference=21st Altenberg Workshop in Theoretical Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ploeger and Galis tackled modular evolvability and developmental constraints in human and other primate evolutionary trajectories. They argue that these should be treated with an interdisciplinary approach across the cognitive sciences. They frame this in the context of:

# Modularity — the ability of a system to organize individuals for the benefit of the whole
# Evolvability — ability of organism or organisms to adapt through evolution 
# Developmental constraints — those things that act as barriers to evolutionary adaptations.&lt;ref name="Ploeger 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Ploeger | first=Annemie | last2=Galis | first2=Frietson | date=2011-07-01 | title=evolutionary developmental biology and cognitive science | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.137/abstract | journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science| volume=2 | issue=4 | pages=429–440 | doi=10.1002/wcs.137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction usually involves homogeneous and/or heterogeneous [[Catalysis|catalysts]] to improve the quality of products and yields.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Carbon and hydrogen of an organic material, such as biomass, peat or low-ranked coals (lignite) are thermo-chemically converted into hydrophobic compounds with low viscosity and high solubility.

== History ==
As early as the 1920s, the concept of using hot water and alkali catalysts to produce oil out of biomass was proposed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Production of Oil from Plant Material|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/99/2573/309|journal = Science|date = 1944-04-21|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 17737216|pages = 309–312|volume = 99|issue = 2573|doi = 10.1126/science.99.2573.309|first = E.|last = Berl|bibcode = 1944Sci....99..309B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the foundation of later HTL technologies that attracted research interest especially during the 1970s oil embargo. It was around that time that a high-pressure (hydrothermal) liquefaction process was developed at the Pittsburgh Energy Research Center (PERC) and later demonstrated (at the 100&amp;nbsp;kg/h scale) at the Albany Biomass Liquefaction Experimental Facility at Albany, Oregon, US.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ToorReview" /&gt; In 1982, Shell Oil developed the HTU™ process in the

== Chemical reactions ==
In hydrothermal liquefaction processes, long carbon chain molecules in biomass are thermally cracked and oxygen is removed in the form of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (dehydration) and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (decarboxylation). These reactions result in the production of high H/C ratio bio-oil. Simplified descriptions of dehydration and decarboxylation reactions can be found in the literature (e.g. Asghari and Yoshida (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dehydration of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in sub-critical water over heterogeneous zirconium phosphate catalysts|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008621506003363|journal = Carbohydrate Research|date = 2006-10-16|pages = 2379–2387|volume = 341|issue = 14|doi = 10.1016/j.carres.2006.06.025|first = Feridoun Salak|last = Asghari|first2 = Hiroyuki|last2 = Yoshida}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Snåre et al.

==Process==
Most applications of hydrothermal liquefaction operate at temperatures between 250-550&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C and high pressures of 5-25 MPa as well as catalysts for 20–60 minutes,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; although higher or lower temperatures can be used to optimize gas or liquid yields, respectively.&lt;ref name="ToorReview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toor|first1=Saqib Sohail|last2=Rosendahl|first2=Lasse|last3=Rudolf|first3=Andreas|title=Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass: A review of subcritical water technologies|journal=Energy|date=May 2011|volume=36|pages=2328–2342|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At these temperatures and pressures, the water present in the biomass becomes either subcritical or supercritical, depending on the conditions, and acts as a solvent, reactant, and catalyst to facilitate the reaction of biomass to bio-oil.

The exact conversion of biomass to bio-oil is dependent on several variables:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Feedstock composition
* Temperature and heating rate
* Pressure
* Solvent
* Residence time
* Catalysts

===Feedstock===

Theoretically, any biomass can be converted into bio-oil using hydrothermal liquefaction regardless of water content, and various different biomasses have been tested, from forestry and agriculture residues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosinkova|first1=Jana|last2=Ramirez|first2=Jerome|last3=Jablonsky|first3=Michal|last4=Ristovski|first4=Zoran|last5=Brown|first5=Richard|last6=Rainey|first6=Thomas|title=Energy and chemical conversion of five Australian lignocellulosic feedstocks into bio-crude through liquefaction|journal=RSC Advances|date=24 May 2017|volume=7|issue=44|page=27707-27717|doi=10.1039/C7RA02335A|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2017/RA/C7RA02335A}}&lt;/ref&gt;, sewage sludges, food process wastes, to emerging non-food biomass such as algae.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ToorReview"/&gt; The composition of cellulose, hemicellulose, protein, and lignin in the feedstock influence the yield and quality of the oil from the process.

===Temperature and Heating Rate===
Temperature plays a major role in the conversion of biomass to bio-oil. The temperature of the reaction determines the depolymerization of the biomass to bio-oil, as well as the repolymerization into char.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While the ideal reaction temperature is dependent on the feedstock used, temperatures above ideal lead to an increase in char formation and eventually increased gas formation, while lower than ideal temperatures reduce depolymerization and overall product yields.

Similarly to temperature, the rate of heating plays a critical role in the production of the different phase streams, due to the prevalence of secondary reactions at non-optimum heating rates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Secondary reactions become dominant in heating rates that are too low, leading to the formation of char. While high heating rates are required to form liquid bio-oil, there is a threshold heating rate and temperature where liquid production is inhibited and gas production is favored in secondary reactions.

===Pressure===
Pressure (along with temperature) determines the super- or subcritical state of solvents as well as overall reaction kinetics and the energy inputs required to yield the desirable HTL products (oil, gas, chemicals, char etc.).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Residence Time===
Hydrothermal liquefaction is a fast process, resulting in low residence times for depolymerization to occur. Typical residence times are measured in minutes (15 to 60 minutes); however, the residence time is highly dependent on the reaction conditions, including feedstock, solvent ratio and temperature. As such, optimization of the residence time is necessary to ensure a complete depolymerizaiton without allowing further reactions to occur.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Catalysts===
While water acts as a catalyst in the reaction, other catalysts can be added to the reaction vessel to optimize the conversion.&lt;ref name="DuanCatalyst"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=Peigao|last2=Savage|first2=Phillip E.|title=Hydrothermal Liquefaction of a Microalga with Heterogeneous Catalysts|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|date=2011|volume=50|pages=52–61|doi=10.1021/ie100758s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously used catalysts include water-soluble inorganic compounds and salts, including KOH and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as transition metal catalysts using [[Nickel|Ni]], [[Palladium|Pd]], [[Platinum|Pt]], and [[Ruthenium|Ru]] supported on either [[carbon]], [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] or [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]]. The addition of these catalysts can lead to an oil yield increase of 20% or greater, due to the catalysts converting the protein, cellulose, and hemicellulose into oil. This ability for catalysts to convert biomaterials other than fats and oils to bio-oil allows for a wider range of feedstock to be used.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Environmental Impact==
Biofuels that are produced through hydrothermal liquefaction are [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon neutral]], meaning that there are no net carbon emissions produced when burning the biofuel. The plant materials used to produce bio-oils use photosynthesis to grow, and as such consume carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The burning of the biofuels produced releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but is nearly completely offset by the carbon dioxide consumed from growing the plants, resulting in a release of only 15-18 g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh or energy produced. This is substantially lower than the releases rate of fossil fuel technologies, which can range from releases of 955 g/kWh (coal), 813 g/kWh (oil), and 446 g/kWh (natural gas).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Recently, Steeper Energy announced that the [[Emission intensity|Carbon Intensity (CI)]] of its Hydrofaction™ oil is 15 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq/MJ according to [http://www.ghgenius.ca/ GHGenius model] (version 4.03a), while diesel fuel is 93.55 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq/MJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://steeperenergy.com/news/milestones-and-activities|title = Milestones &amp; Activities|date = Q3 2015|accessdate = 3 Sep 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Steeper Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrothermal liquefaction is a clean process that doesn't produce harmful compounds, such as ammonia, NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, or SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Instead the [[heteroatom]]s, including nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine, are converted into harmless byproducts such as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and inorganic acids that can be neutralized with bases.

==Compare with Pyrolysis and other [[Biomass to liquid|BtL]] technologies==
The HTL process differs from [[pyrolysis]] as it can process wet biomass and produce a bio-oil that contains approximately twice the energy density of pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis is a related process to HTL, but biomass must be processed and dried in order to increase the yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bridgwater|first1=A.V|last2=Peacocke|first2=G.V.C|title=Fast pyrolysis processes for biomass|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|date=March 2000|volume=4|pages=1–73|doi=10.1016/s1364-0321(99)00007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of water in pyrolysis drastically increases the heat of vaporization of the organic material, increasing the energy required to decompose the biomass. Typical pyrolysis processes require a water content of less than 40% to suitably convert the biomass to bio-oil. This requires considerable pretreatment of wet biomass such as tropical grasses, which contain a water content as high as 80-85%, and even further treatment for aquatic species, which can contain higher than 90% water content.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The HTL oil can contain up to 80% of the feedstock carbon content (single pass).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; HTL oil has good potential to yield bio-oil with "drop-in" properties that can be directly distributed in existing petroleum infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass: A review of subcritical water technologies|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544211001691|journal = Energy|date = 2011-05-01|pages = 2328–2342|volume = 36|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.013|first = Saqib Sohail|last = Toor|first2 = Lasse|last2 = Rosendahl|first3 = Andreas|last3 = Rudolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-02/au-hl020613.php|title = Hydrothermal liquefaction -- the most promising path to a sustainable bio-oil production|last = AARHUS UNIVERSITY|first = |date = 6 Feb 2013|work = |access-date = 3 Sep 2015|via = http://www.eurekalert.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday 5 September 2007, the [[Australian House of Representatives]] Environment and Heritage Committee presented, to the [[Speaker_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives | Speaker]], its report on the inquiry into a sustainability charter entitled ''Sustainability for survival: creating a climate for change''.

A key recommendation within this report was to restate the need for a [[Australian sustainability commission | national Sustainability Commission]] headed by a Sustainability Commissioner that was previously recommended in the [[Sustainable Cities Report]] published in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2487">The '''Institute for Language and Speech Processing''' (ILSP) ({{lang-el|Ινστιτούτο Επεξεργασίας του Λόγου, ΙΕΛ}}) is a [[Greece|Greek]] non-profit private foundation focusing on applied research in [[Speech Processing]], [[Natural Language Processing]]  and [[Computer-assisted language learning|Computer-Assisted Language Learning]]. The goal of ILSP is to support the growth of Language Technology in [[Greece]]. For this purpose it has brought together a team of experts and has created the necessary technical infrastructure in accordance with the [[European Community]] policy towards safeguarding the European cultural heritage through technology. ILSP aims to be a pole of attraction for the [[language industry]], which is growing both in Greece and in the rest of [[Europe]], thus contributing to the expansion of activities in this particularly important area of modern IT. The industrial direction which it maintains, the experience of its researchers and the close relations which it keeps with key research centres in other European countries, are the three basic elements in the profile of ILSP.

ILSP carries out applied research in Man-Machine Interfaces, [[Machine Learning]], [[Speech Processing]], [[Text Processing]], Theoretical and [[Computational Linguistics]] and Language Learning Technologies.  Expertise used by the Institute includes basic fields as [[Natural Language Processing]], [[Digital Signal Processing]] and [[Pattern Recognition]]. Its mission is mainly to support basic research, promoting on the other hand the development of new products in the form of laboratory prototypes.

The research taking place both for Natural Language Processing and Speech Processing gives these areas new impetus, which stems from their complementarity. Taking as a fact that the Institute combines in its activities the research in these two thematic areas, it has the ability to successfully deal with those issues that require know-how from both domains.

The Institute pushes the technologies developed in the framework of projects until the phase of industrial prototypes and products, using the full cycle of industrial development including quality control.

The '''Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies''' is an interfaculty interdisciplinary research centre of the Humanities and Social Sciences at [[KU Leuven]], Belgium. It carries out and supports interdisciplinary research on topics related to globalization, global governance processes and multilateralism, and has been recognized as a KU Leuven Centre of Excellence.

== History and Research ==
The Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies carries out and supports interdisciplinary research on topics related to globalization, global governance processes and multilateralism, with a particular focus on the following areas, taking the many cross-cutting issues into account: (i) the European Union and global governance, (ii) human rights, democracy and rule of law, (iii) trade and sustainable development, (iv) peace and security, (v) emerging powers, (vi) federalism and multi-level governance, (vii) global commons and outer space, and (viii) non-state actors.

In full recognition of the complex issues involved, the Centre approaches global governance from a multilevel and multi-actor perspective. The Centre considers non-European perspectives to global governance of great importance. It also hosts the InBev-Baillet Latour EU-China Chair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/projects/eu_china_chair|title=– InBev-Baillet Latour EU-China Chair|website=ghum.kuleuven.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; which engages in interdisciplinary research and education on EU-China relations in close synergy with the InBev-Baillet Latour EU-China Chair at the Université catholique de Louvain, and the Leuven India Focus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/projects/india_focus|title=– Leuven India Focus|website=ghum.kuleuven.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which aims at developing knowledge and expertise on India and South Asia by organizing conferences, lectures and seminars and interdisciplinary research. The Centre regularly organizes transatlantic conferences and events focusing on Latin America and Asia, and takes a keen interest in the Global South.

In addition to its fundamental research, the Centre carries out independent applied research and advises policy-makers on multilateral governance and global public policy issues. It works with academic and policy partners from all over the world, including the [[European Parliament]], [[European Commission]], [[European External Action Service]], [[Committee of the Regions]], [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO), [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), [[World Bank]] and [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). The Centre publishes the Leuven Global Governance Series&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-elgar.com/search_results.lasso?series_title=Leuven%20Global%20Governance%20series&amp;series_search=Yes&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Edward Elgar Publishing|Edward Elgar Publishers]], makes it research available through academic journal articles, working papers, policy briefs and global governance opinions on its web site and regularly publishes a newsletter.

Since March 2011, the Centre is located in the historical house de Dorlodot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghum.kuleuven.be/ggs/contact.html|title=Contact Information|website=ghum.kuleuven.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the Centre of Leuven. The house is named after {{ill|Henry de Dorlodot|nl}}, a Belgian theologian and paleontologist (1855–1929).

'''Linguistic Intelligence''' is a part of [[Howard Gardner]]'s [[Theory of multiple intelligences|multiple intelligence theory]] that deals with individuals' ability to understand both [[Spoken language|spoken]] and [[written language]], as well as their ability to speak and write themselves.  In a practical sense, linguistic intelligence is the extent to which an individual can use [[language]], both written and verbal, to achieve goals.&lt;ref name="FM 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernandez-Martinez|first=Fernando|author2=Kseniya Zablotskaya |author3=Wolfgang Minker |title=Text categorization methods for automatic estimation of verbal intelligence|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|date=Aug 2012|volume=39|issue=10|pages=9807–9820|doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2012.02.173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, high linguistic intelligence has been linked to improved [[problem solving]], as well as to increased [[Abstraction|abstract reasoning]].&lt;ref name="Luwel 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luwel|first=Koen|author2=Ageliki Foustana |author3=Patrick Onghena |author4=Lieven Verschaffel |title=The role of verbal and performance intelligence in children's strategy selection and execution|journal=Learning and Individual Differences|date=Apr 2013|volume=24|pages=134–138|doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2013.01.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, only the verbal aspects are taken into consideration. This is usually referred to as verbal intelligence or verbal fluency, and is commonly a reflection of an individual's overall linguistic intelligence.

==Physiologic and functional overview==
In order to understand linguistic intelligence, it is important to understand the [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] that control speech and language. These mechanisms can be broken down into four major groups: [[speech|speech generation]] (talking), [[Hearing|speech comprehension]] (hearing), [[Writing|writing generation]] (writing), and [[Reading (process)|writing comprehension]] (reading).

===Spoken language===

====Generation====
{{Main|Speech}}
[[File:Inferior frontal gyrus.png|thumb|left|[[Inferior frontal gyrus]]; a major part of the [[inferior frontal cortex]]]]
Speech production is process by which a thought in the brain is converted into an understandable auditory form.&lt;ref name="Bohland 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohland|first=Jason|author2=Daniel Bullock |author3=Frank Guenther |title=Neural Representations and Mechanisms for the Performance of Simple Speech Sequences|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=Jul 2010|volume=22|issue=7|pages=1504–1529|doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21306|pmid=19583476|pmc=2937837}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dan 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dan|first=Haruka |author2=Sano, Kyutoku |author3=Oguro, Yokota |author4=Tsuzuki, Watanabe|title=Language-specific cortical activation patterns for verbal fluency tasks in Japanese as assessed by multichannel functional near-infrared spectroscopy|journal=Brain and Language|date=Aug 2013|volume=126|issue=2|pages=208–216|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2013.05.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodd|first=J.M. |author2=M.H. Davis |author3=I.S. Johnsrude|title=The neural mechanisms of speech comprehension: fMRI studies of semantic ambiguity|journal=Cerebral Cortex|date=Aug 2005|volume=15|issue=8|pages=1261–1269|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhi009|pmid=15635062}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a multistage mechanism that involves many different areas of the brain. The first stage is planning, where the brain constructs words and sentences that turn the thought into an understandable form.&lt;ref name="Bohland 2010" /&gt; This occurs primarily in the [[inferior frontal cortex]], specifically in an area known as [[Broca's area]].&lt;ref name="Dan 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Konrad 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Konrad|first=Andreas|author2=Goran Vucurevic |author3=Francesco Musso |author4=Georg Winterer |title=VBM-DTI Correlates of Verbal Intelligence: A Potential Link to Broca's area|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|date=Apr 2012|volume=24|issue=4|pages=888–895|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00187 |pmid=22220724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, the brain must plan how to physically create the sounds necessary for speech by linking the planned speech with known sounds, or [[phonemes]]. While the location of these associations is not known, it is known that the [[supplementary motor area]] plays a key role in this step.&lt;ref name="Bohland 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Penfield&gt;{{cite book|last=Penfield|first=Wilder|title=Speech and Brain-Mechanism|year=1959|publisher=Atheneum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the brain must signal for the words to actually be spoken. This is carried out by the [[premotor cortex]] and the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

[[File:Human motor cortex topography.png|thumb|right|[[Motor cortex]] with muscle [[localization of function|localization]] shown]]
In most cases, speech production is controlled by the left hemisphere. In a series of studies, [[Wilder Penfield]], among others, probed the brains of both right-handed (generally [[Lateralization of brain function|left-hemisphere dominant]]) and left-handed (generally [[Lateralization of brain function|right-hemisphere dominant]]) patients. They discovered that, regardless of [[handedness]], the left hemisphere was almost always the speech controlling side. However, it has been discovered that in cases of neural [[Stress (biology)|stress]] ([[hemorrhage]], [[stroke]], etc.) the right hemisphere has the ability to take control of speech functions.&lt;ref name=Doidge&gt;{{cite book|last=Doidge|first=Norman|title=The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science|year=2007|publisher=Penguin Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comprehension ===
{{Main|Hearing}}
Verbal Comprehension is a fairly complex process, and it is not fully understood. From various studies and experiments, it has been found that the [[superior temporal sulcus]] activates when hearing human speech, and that speech processing seems to occur within [[Wernicke's area]].&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

====Auditory feedback and feedforward====
Hearing plays an important part in both speech generation and comprehension. When speaking, the person can hear their speech, and the brain uses what it hears as a [[feedback]] mechanism to fix [[speech error]]s.&lt;ref name="Perkell 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkell|first=Joseph|title=Movement goals and feedback and feed forward control mechanisms in speech production|journal=Journal of Neurolinguistics|date=Sep 2012|volume=25|issue=5|pages=382–407|doi=10.1016/j.jneuroling.2010.02.011|pmc=3361736}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a single [[feedback]] correction occurs multiple times, the brain will begin to incorporate the correction to all future speech, making it a [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]] mechanism.&lt;ref name="Perkell 2012" /&gt; This is apparent in some deaf people. [[Deafness]], as well as other, smaller deficiencies in hearing, can greatly affect one's ability to comprehend spoken language, as well as to speak it.&lt;ref name="Tourville 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tourville|first=Jason|author2=Kevin Reilly |author3=Frank Guenther |title=Neural mechanisms underlying auditory feedback control of speech|journal=NeuroImage|date=1 February 2008|volume=39|issue=3|pages=1429–1443|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.09.054}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the person loses hearing ability later in life, most can still maintain a normal level of verbal intelligence. This is thought to be because of the brain's [[Feed forward (control)|feed forward]] mechanism still helping to fix [[speech error]]s, even in the absence of [[auditory feedback]].&lt;ref name="Perkell 2012" /&gt;

===Written language===

====Generation====
{{Main|Writing}}
Generation of written language is thought to be closely related to speech generation, relying on [[Broca's area]] for early processing and on the [[inferior frontal gyrus]] for semantic processing.&lt;ref name="Rodd 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; However, writing differs in two major ways. First, instead of relating the thought to sounds, the brain must relate the thought to symbols or letters, and second, the [[motor cortex]] activates a different set of muscles to write, than when speaking.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

====Comprehension====
{{Main|Reading (process)|l1=Reading}}
Written comprehension, similar to spoken comprehension, seems to occur primarily in [[Wernicke's area]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; However, instead of using the auditory system to gain language input, written comprehension relies on the visual system.

==Genetic links==
[[File:Protein NRXN1 PDB 1c4r.png|thumb|right|Protein NRXN1, which is created from the NRXN1 gene]]
While the capabilities of the physical structures used are large factors in determining linguistic intelligence, there have been several [[genes]] that have been linked to individual linguistic ability.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szalontai|first=Adam|author2=Katalin Csiszar |title=Genetic insights into the functional elements of language|journal=Human Genetics|date=September 2013|volume=132|issue=9|pages=959–986|doi=10.1007/s00439-013-1317-0|pmid=23749164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NRXN1]] gene has been linked to general language ability, and [[mutation]]s of this gene has been shown to cause major issues to overall linguistic intelligence.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; The [[CNTNAP2]] gene is believed to affect [[language development]] and performance, and [[mutation]]s in this gene is thought to be involved in [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]].&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[PCDH11]] has been linked to language capacity, and it is believed to be one of the factors that accounts for the variation in linguistic intelligence.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt;

==Measurement and testing==
In general, it is difficult to test for linguistic intelligence as a whole, therefore verbal intelligence is often measured instead. This is done using various types of [[verbal fluency test]]s.&lt;ref name="Dan 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Konrad 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CC 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Casals-Coll|first=M. |author2=Sanchez-Benavides |author3=Quintana |author4=Manero |author5=Rognoni |author6=Calvo |author7=Palomo |author8=Aranciva |author9=Tamayo |author10=Pena-Casanova |title=Spanish normative studies in young adults (NEURONORMA young adults project): Normative data: norms for verbal fluency tests|journal=Neurologia|date=Jan–Feb 2013|volume=28|issue=1|pages=33–40|doi=10.1016/j.nrleng.2012.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal fluency tests===
*[[Semantics|Semantic]] Fluency Test - Subjects are asked to produce words in groups, such as animals, kitchen tools, fruits, etc. This type of test focuses on the subject's ability to generate words that have meaning to them. This test has been found to be sensitive to age.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
*Formal Fluency Test - Subjects are asked to produce words given specific letter-based rules. This test has been found to be sensitive to education level.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
**Initial Letter Fluency Test - A type of formal fluency test where the subject is asked to list words starting with a specific letter.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
**Excluded Letter Fluency Test - A type of formal fluency test where the subject is asked to list words that do not contain a certain letter.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
*[[Verb]] Fluency Test - Subjects are asked to list verbs. Subjects are then tested on their ability to use listed verbs.&lt;ref name="CC 2013" /&gt;
*Verbal Reproduction Test - Subjects are asked to listen to a [[monologue]]. They are then asked to repeat the monologue, and the subject is scored based on the number of words and [[Lemma (morphology)|lemmas]] used from the original monologue.&lt;ref name="FM 2012" /&gt;

===Verbal fluency in children===
In one series of tests, it was shown that when children were given verbal fluency tests, a larger portion of their [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] activated compared to adults, as well as activation of both the left and right hemispheres. This is most likely due to the high [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] of newly developing brains.&lt;ref name="Gaillard 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaillard|first=W.D. |author2=Hertz-Pannier |author3=Mott |author4=Barnett |author5=LeBihan |author6=Theodore |title=Functional anatomy of cognitive development - fMRI of verbal fluency in children and adults|journal=Neurology|date=Jan 2000|volume=54|issue=1|pages=180–185|doi=10.1212/wnl.54.1.180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible conflict===
Recently, a study was done showing that verbal fluency test results can differ depending on the mental focus of the subject. In this study, mental focus on physical [[speech production]] mechanisms caused speech production times to suffer, whereas mental focus on [[auditory feedback]] improved these times.&lt;ref name="Lisman 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lisman|first=Amanda|author2=Neeraja, Sadagopan |title=Focus of attention and speech motor performance|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|date=May–Jun 2013|volume=46|issue=3|pages=281–293|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2013.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disorders affecting linguistic intelligence==
{{Main|Speech-language pathology}}
Since linguistic intelligence is based on several complex skills, there are many disorders and injuries that can affect an individual's linguistic intelligence.

===Injuries===
Damage and injury in the brain can severely lower one's ability to communicate, and therefore lower one's linguistic intelligence. Common forms of major damage are [[strokes]], [[concussions]], [[brain tumor]]s, [[Virus|viral]]/[[bacteria]]l damage, and [[drug]]-related damage. The three major [[Language disorder|linguistic disorders]] that result from these injuries are [[aphasia]], [[alexia (condition)|alexia]], and [[agraphia]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; [[Aphasia]] is the inability to speak, and can be caused by damage to [[Broca's area]] or the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; Alexia is the inability to read, which can arise from damage to [[Wernicke's area]], among other places.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; [[Agraphia]] is the inability to write which can also arise from damage to [[Broca's area]] or the [[motor cortex]].&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; In addition, damage to large areas of the brain can result in any combinations of these disorders, as well as a loss of other abilities.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

===Pure language disorders===
There are several disorders that primarily affect only language skills. Three major pure language disorders are [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]], [[specific language impairment]], and [[stuttering]].&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]] (DVD) is a disorder where children have errors in consonant and vowel production.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Specific language impairment]] (SLI) is a disorder where the patient has a lack of [[language acquisition]] skills, despite a seemingly normal [[intelligence]] level in other areas.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Stuttering]] is a fairly common disorder where speech flow is interrupted by involuntary repetitions of [[syllable]]s.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt;

===Other disorders affecting language===
Some disorders cause a wide array of effects, and language impairment is merely one of many possible [[symptom]]s. The two major disorders of this type are  [[autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder]] and [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Autism]] and other [[autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD) are disorders in which the patient suffers from decreased [[social skills]] and lowered [[Cognitive flexibility|mental flexibility]]. As a result, many patients suffering from ASDs also have language problems, arising from both the lack of social interaction and lowered mental flexibility.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt; [[Epilepsy]] is a disorder where electrical malfunctions or mis-communications in the brain cause [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]], leading to muscle [[spasm]]s and activation of other organs and systems of the body. Over time, epilepsy can lead to cognitive and behavioral decay. This mental decay can eventually lead to a loss of language and communication skills.&lt;ref name="Szalontai 2013" /&gt;

In George W. Bush's own words, "I told [[Laura Bush|Laura]] and our artist friend [[Pamela Nelson|Pam Nelson]] that I might like to take up painting. They were surprised — I had been an art-agnostic all my life. Laura said, “You ought to try it.” It seemed like she was slightly skeptical. Pam suggested I hire her friend Gail Norfleet, a notable and talented Dallas artist, as my instructor. Several days later, Gail came over to the house and asked me what my objectives were. “Gail, there's a Rembrandt trapped in this body,” I told her. “Your job is to liberate him.”"&lt;/ref&gt; and best expertly researched (visual) artists in history.&lt;ref name="Slive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FranitsAshgate2016"/&gt;

His life and art have long attracted the attention of multidisciplinary scholarship such as [[art history]], [[social history]], [[cultural history]], [[history of ideas]], [[education]], [[humanities]], [[aesthetics]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[literary studies]], [[anatomy]], [[medicine]], [[religious studies]], [[theology]], [[Jewish studies]], [[Oriental studies]] ([[Asian studies]]), [[globalization studies]], and [[art market|art market research]]. In Rembrandt scholar Stephanie Dickey's words: {{quote|[Rembrandt] earned international renown as a painter, printmaker, teacher, and art collector while never leaving the Dutch Republic. In his home city of Leiden and in Amsterdam, where he worked for nearly forty years, he mentored generations of other painters and produced a body of work that has never ceased to attract admiration, critique, and interpretation. (...) Rembrandt's art is a key component in any study of the Dutch Golden Age, and his membership in the canon of artistic genius is well established, but he is also a figure whose significance transcends specialist interest. Literary critics have pondered "Rembrandt" as a "cultural text"; novelists, playwrights, and filmmakers have romanticized his life, and in popular culture, his name has become synonymous with excellence for products and services, ranging from toothpaste to self-help advice."&lt;ref name="FranitsAshgate2016"&gt;Franits, Wayne (ed.): ''The Ashgate Research Companion to Dutch Art of the Seventeenth Century''. (Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For a visual artist in general and an [[Old Master]] in particular, Rembrandt (i.e. his life, art, and circle) has been the subject of a vast amount of literature that includes both [[fiction]] and nonfiction works. The field of [[:Category:Rembrandt studies|Rembrandt studies]] (study of Rembrandt's life and work, including works by [[List of Rembrandt pupils|his pupils and followers]]) — as an academic field in its own right with many noted [[List of Rembrandt connoisseurs and scholars|Rembrandt connoisseurs and scholars]] — has been one of the most dynamic research areas of [[Netherlandish art]] (or [[art of the Low Countries|art of the pre-1830 Low Countries]]) history.&lt;ref name="Slive"&gt;[[Seymour Slive|Slive, Seymour]]: ''Rembrandt and his Critics, 1630–1730''. (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1953)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dickey, Stephanie: ''Rembrandt and his Circle: Insights and Discoveries''. (Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is based on a systematic user co-creation approach integrating research and innovation processes. These are integrated through the co-creation, exploration, experimentation and evaluation of innovative ideas, scenarios, concepts and related technological artefacts in real life use cases. Such use cases involve user communities, not only as observed subjects but also as a source of creation. This approach allows all involved stakeholders to concurrently consider both the global performance of a product or service and its potential adoption by users. This consideration may be made at the earlier stage of research and development and through all elements of the product life-cycle, from design up to recycling.&lt;ref&gt;Kusiak, A.; Tang, C.-Y.: Innovation in a requirement life-cycle framework, Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, IMS’2006, Sakarya University, Sakarya, Turkey, 2006, 61-67.&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Concurrent engineering]]

More recently, the [[Web 2.0]] has demonstrated the positive impact of involving user communities in [[new product development]] (NPD) such as [[mass collaboration]] projects (e.g.  [[crowdsourcing]], [[Wisdom of Crowds]]) in [[collective intelligence|collectively]] creating new contents and applications.

A living lab is not similar to a [[testbed]] as its philosophy is to turn users, from being traditionally considered as observed subjects for testing modules against requirements, into value creation in contributing to the co-creation and exploration of emerging ideas, breakthrough scenarios, innovative concepts and related artefacts. Hence, a living lab rather constitutes an experiential environment, which could be compared to the concept of [[experiential learning]], where users are immersed in a creative social space for designing and experiencing their own future. Living labs could also be used by policy makers and users/citizens for designing, exploring, experiencing and refining new policies and regulations in real-life scenarios for evaluating their potential impacts before their implementations.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

==Description==
The term ''living lab'' has emerged in parallel from the ambient intelligence research communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ami-communities.eu/wiki/AMI%40Work_on-line_Communities|title=AMI@Work on-line Communities |work=AMI@Work Communities Wiki |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; context and from the discussion on experience and application research (EAR).&lt;ref&gt;ISTAG EAR working group report "Involving users in the development of Ambient Intelligence" on http://www.cordis.lu/ist/istag.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of the term is based on the concept of [[user experience]]&lt;ref&gt;Gaver, W.W., Boucher, A., Pennington, S. and Walker, B.

William J. Mitchell, Kent Larson, and Alex (Sandy) Pentland at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are credited with first exploring the concept of a Living Laboratory.  They argued that a living lab represents a user-centric research methodology for sensing, prototyping, validating and refining complex solutions in multiple and evolving real life contexts. Nowadays, several living lab descriptions and definitions are available from different sources.&lt;ref&gt;Core Labs (2006), http://www.ami-communities.net/wiki/CORELABS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niitamo, V.-P.; Kulkki, S.; Eriksson, M.; Hribernik, K.

Living Labs for user-driven open innovation. An overview of the Living Labs methodology, activities and achievements. January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Mitchell, Larson and Pentland, formed the first US-based living labs research consortium. According to the consortium website:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livinglabs.mit.edu |title=MIT Living Labs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The convergence of globalization, changing demographics, and urbanization is transforming almost every aspect of our lives.  We face new choices about where and how we work, live, travel, communicate, and maintain health.  Ultimately, our societies are being transformed.  MIT Living Labs brings together interdisciplinary experts to develop, deploy, and test - in actual living environments - new technologies and strategies for design that respond to this changing world.  Our work spans in scale from the personal to the urban, and addresses challenges related to health, energy, and creativity.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The consortium has since been reorganized as the City Science Initiative at the MIT Media Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cities.media.mit.edu/ |title=MIT City Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "living lab" or "living laboratory" is also used for representing a residential home research facility where the behaviour of people living in this house is observed and usage patterns are collected by researchers that are investigating methods for merging new technologies with user-centered design. In this type of living lab, users are more observed subjects than engaged in the co-creation of ideas and breakthrough scenarios. There are examples of such research facilities like PlaceLab at MIT developed by Kent Larson and Stephen Intille and ExperienceLab at Philips Research. In the Netherlands, Utrecht University has created the Governance Lab Utrecht

* Co-creation: bring together technology push and application pull (i.e. crowdsourcing, crowdcasting) into a diversity of views, constraints and knowledge sharing that sustains the ideation of new scenarios, concepts and related artefacts.
* Exploration: engage all stakeholders, especially user communities, at the earlier stage of the co-creation process for discovering emerging scenarios, usages and behaviours through live scenarios in real or virtual environments (e.g. [[virtual reality]], [[augmented reality]], [[mixed reality]]).
* Experimentation: implement the proper level of technological artefacts to experience live scenarios with a large number of users while collecting data which will be analysed in their context during the evaluation activity.
* Evaluation: assess new ideas and innovative concepts as well as related technological artefacts in real life situations through various dimensions such as socio-ergonomic, socio-cognitive and socio-economic aspects; make observations on the potentiality of a viral adoption of new concepts and related technological artefacts through a confrontation with users' value models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2910">A '''metabibliography''' (or '''biblio-bibliography''') is a [[bibliography]] of bibliographies.

Bibliographies serve the finding of relevant documents. Metabibliographies serve the finding of the relevant bibliographies in which the relevant documents may be found. One might quote Patrick Wilson:

"For if knowledge is power, power over knowledge is power to increase one's power; and if the stock of writings is thought of mainly as it represents a stock of knowledge, it is natural to propose treating it as a "resource" to be subjected to rational control, managemenet and utilization." (Wilson, 1968, p. 145).

Metabibliographies are valuable for building reference collections, but usually of less interest to the average user, who rely on bibliographies selected by others.

A '''microprocessor development board''' is a printed circuit board containing a [[microprocessor]] and the minimal support logic needed for a [[computer engineer]] to become acquainted with the microprocessor on the board and to learn to program it. It also served users of the microprocessor as a method to prototype applications in products.

Unlike a general-purpose system such as a [[home computer]], usually a development board contains little or no hardware dedicated to a user interface. It will have some provision to accept and run a user-supplied program, such as downloading a program through a [[serial port]] to [[flash memory]], or some form of [[EPROM|programmable memory]] in a socket in earlier systems.

==History==
The reason for the existence of a development board was solely to provide a system for learning to use a new microprocessor, not for entertainment. So everything superfluous was left out to keep costs down. Even an enclosure was not supplied, nor a power supply. This is because the board would only be used in a "laboratory" environment so it did not need an enclosure, and the board could be powered by a typical bench power supply already available to an electronic engineer.

Microprocessor training development kits were not always produced by microprocessor manufacturers. Many systems that can be classified as microprocessor development kits were produced by third parties, one example is the Sinclair [[MK14]], which was inspired by the official [[SC/MP]] development board from [[National Semiconductor]], the "[[NS introkit]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.old-computers.com/MUSEUM/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=1147 description of the National Semiconductor ''introkit''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these development boards were not designed for hobbyists, they were often bought by them because they were the earliest cheap microcomputer devices you could buy. They often added all kinds of expansions, such as more memory, a video interface etc. It was very popular to use (or write) an implementation of [[Tiny Basic]]. The most popular microprocessor board, the [[KIM-1]], received the most attention from the hobby community, because it was much cheaper than most other development boards, and you could get more software for it (Tiny Basic, games, assemblers), and cheap expansion cards to add more memory or other functionality.&lt;ref&gt;http://oldcomputers.net/kim1.html KIM was very popular with hobbyists&lt;/ref&gt; More articles were published in magazines like "[[Kilobaud Microcomputing (magazine)|Kilobaud Microcomputing]]" that described home-brew software and hardware for the KIM-1 than for other development boards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commodore.ca/gallery/magazines/kim1/where_is_kim_going.htm why Kilobaud published KIM software]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today some chip producers still release "test boards" to demonstrate their chips, and to use them as a "[[reference design]]". Their significance these days is much smaller than it was in the days that such boards, (the [[KIM-1]] being the [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]ical example) were the only low cost way to get "hands-on" acquainted with microprocessors..

==Features==
The most important feature of the microprocessor development board was the ROM based built-in machine language monitor, or "debugger" as it was also sometimes called. Often the name of the board was related to the name of this monitor program, for example the name of the monitor program of the KIM-1 was "Keyboard Input Monitor", because the ROM based software allowed entry of programs without the rows of cumbersome toggle switches that older systems used. The popular 6800 based systems often used a monitor with a name with the word "bug" for "debugger" in it, for example the popular "[[MIKBUG]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Input was normally done with a hexadecimal keyboard, using a [[machine language monitor]] program, and the display only consisted of a 7-segment display. Backup storage of written assembler programs was primitive: only a cassette type interface was typically provided, or the serial [[teleprinter|Teletype]] interface was used to read (or punch) a [[papertape]].&lt;ref&gt;http://retro.hansotten.nl/index.php?page=micro-kim Micro-KIM is a retro remake of the KIM for which many programs are available that were originally released on papertape&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the board has some kind to expansion connector that brought out all the necessary CPU signals, so that an engineer could build and test an experimental interface or other electronic device.

External interfaces on the bare board were often limited to a single [[RS-232]] or [[current loop]] serial port, so a [[dumb terminal|terminal]], printer, or Teletype could be connected.

'''Motorcycle design''' can be described as activities that define the appearance, function and engineering of [[motorcycle]]s.

Professionally it is a branch of [[industrial design]], similar to [[automotive design]] using identical techniques and methodology, but confined by a set of conventions about what is acceptable to the buying public. These conventions have been defined by the acceptance of the industry and media as a whole to the assumption that the public will only purchase machines that bear more than a passing resemblance to competition machines of whatever kind. In some large [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] motorcycle manufacturers, the term designer can also be applied to the project leader or chief engineer charged with laying down the principal architecture of the vehicle.  In recent years it has also become associated with custom or "[[chopper (motorcycle)|chopper]]" builder culture.

Professional motorcycle designers almost always hold degrees in industrial design, industrial design engineering or similar, and have training in styling, modeling, as well as knowledge in aspects of technology associated with single track vehicles.  Although no degree as a specialisation exists per se, the majority of candidates graduate through colleges and universities with established transportation design courses, and are trained as automotive designers.

Most OEM motorcycle manufacturers, such as [[Honda]], [[Suzuki]], [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]], [[BMW]], [[Ducati]], [[Piaggio]] and others have in-house design studios dedicated to this purpose, while others such as [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] and [[KTM]] depend on specialised independent design consultancies.

== Methodology ==

=== Design and engineering relationships ===

Due to the high importance of mechanical components or even exposed engines to motorcycle styling, almost always designers will have a greater sensitivity to and awareness of engineering than will typical car designers.  In OEM situations, large teams of professional engineers and specialists will collaborate on each project development, allowing the designer to focus on the more intangible or subjective aspects of design, such as styling, human-machine interface [[psychology]], and market and cultural relationships.  In other matters such as pure mechanical [[ergonomics]] (such as seat height, handlebar placement, etc.), or basic layout (the location of major components, storage, etc.) there is usually considerable overlap between the designer and engineer.  The designer will nominally approach each problem from a human interface, or "feel" or "irrational" point of view (example : "Does this material feel cold or warm, and is this feeling appropriate to this vehicle's target consumer?"), while the engineer will attack each problem with the "rational" or clinical approach of empirically weighing the cause and effect of each design decision against the project's technical and economic design targets (example : "Can this material be moulded into the designer's desired shape?  Will that be too expensive to produce?")

=== Research and Concept Design ===

In OEM motorcycle design, the normal procedure of developing a new motorcycle involves the same steps in other professional design disciplines : identifying a target consumer, researching them to identify benchmarks and project targets, then proposing concept directions in a written form known as a Design Brief or [[Quality function deployment|QFD]].  From this point, artwork is developed to visually communicate  the designer's ideas.  These are presented in 2Db drawing or illustrated form, from which a winning direction is down selected for further development.  Once a satisfactory design is established on paper (the term paper is a generalization that can include traditional hand renderings, digital artwork or [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] drawings), then full scale modeling begins to realise the design in tangible [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] form.

=== Styling ===

Often used as an interchangeable term with "design", styling is in fact just one component of the design process.  Typically, styling is developed through sketches, renderings and illustrations then realised in 3D form using [[Industrial plasticine|automotive styling clay]], specialised industrial modeling foams such as Sibatool, Renshape or Epiwood, or in increasingly limited cases plaster or body filler.  As the most subjective part of the design process, the various members of the development team must depend heavily on the judgment, skill and experience of the appointed designer to create an appropriate look.

The most misunderstood element and the most dangerous to the success of a product, is the idea that team members should evaluate the design based on personal tastes or preferences.  Industrial design is not an art form, but a focused creative expression using the scientific data and analysis in the Design Brief and QFD as ultimate guidelines.  The target user, their needs and tastes should be reflected in the final design, not necessarily exclusively those of the design team.  Of course, many complex variables such as the OEM brand identity, past successes and failures, and whimsical trends often skew or distort styling decisions.  In instances where the factors are overwhelming, OEM's may err on the side of cautious conservative design.

=== Parallel development ===

Because of the need to reduce development time and costs, the "styling" design model is usually developed in parallel with the engineering 3D design.  While there is an increasing amount of digital design input in the modern OEM design process, nearly all major motorcycle manufacturers still rely on full scale clay models to render the master style model, then scan and import the styling surfaces into suitable 3D software packages (Alias, CATIA, ISEM Surf) for integration into the 3D engineering CAD platform (CATIA, ProEngineer, etc.).  Once combined, the design team can virtually refine the motorcycle by optimising component assembly, checking for any undesirable interferences between parts, and predict and eliminate possible engineering problems.  Typically, designers and engineers will have the greatest number of conflicts during this phase of development, as designers will fight to maintain the original styling and design of the clay model and artwork into the production vehicle, while the engineer will eliminate all problems in the most efficient manner possible.  The success of the final product depends heavily on the level of cooperation between these often conflicting needs.

== Amateur and specialists ==

=== Custom builders ===

In recent years, largely due to the popularity of television programs like ''[[Orange County Chopper]]'' and ''Biker Build-off'', the building of one of a kind "[[chopper (motorcycle)|chopper]]" or "cruiser" type motorcycles has become more mainstream, leading to a flourishing builder industry.  As a whole, these vehicles are not designed in the professional sense, but rather crafted by hand by metal workers and artisans using traditional skills.  The resulting vehicles tend to be very elaborate, expensive and difficult or impossible to reproduce in mass production, but are highly valued for the same reasons.

Among [[custom motorcycle]] culture, certain names have become famous for their creations and have led to mainstream acceptance of previously unacceptable design solutions such as extreme ergonomics, totally rigid rear wheels without the benefit of suspension, minimal lighting and limited ground clearance for cornering.  These design characteristics are purely emotional in nature, being led by styling and image rather than technical or performance considerations.

=== "Specials" ===

Custom and specials motorcycles are similar to the above but tend to be super sport type motorcycles, or at least high-performance based, using many special add-on parts, one-of-a-kind or limited series frames, racing wheels and parts or hand-made components to maximise performance.  While modifying motorcycles is an activity as old as the motorcycle itself, the "special" culture or "[[streetfighter]]" began to flourish in the mid-1970s as a response to the myriad high performance Japanese motorcycles then available, but whose power far exceeded their handling.  Individuals would choose premanufactured parts from catalogs or from other bikes and redesign their particular machine to suit their desires.  In general this activity is limited to one-of-a-kind vehicles and, as with custom motorcycles, uses very little genuine engineering or design methodology, although some small-scale manufacturers exist who make limited runs of a given model.  In some cases, these tiny specialists were successful enough to grow into full-scale OEM companies such as the [[Buell Motorcycle Company]] and [[Bimota]] of [[Italy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3453">'''National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences''' (NARSS) is the pioneering [[Egypt]]ian institution in the field of [[satellite]] [[remote sensing]].

==History==
NARSS is an outgrowth of [[Remote Sensing Center]], established in 1971 as an American-Egyptian joint project, they were affiliated with the Egyptian Academy of Scientific Research and Technology. In 1994 the authority was established as an organization under the State Ministry of Scientific Research to promote the use of state of the art [[space technology]] for the development of the country and introducing High Tech capabilities to [[regional planning]] and other applications.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narss.sci.eg/about|title=About NARSS|access-date=October 27, 2016|website=National Authority for Remote Sensing &amp; Space Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NARSS includes two major sectors: Remote Sensing and [[Space science|Space Sciences]]. The sector of remote sensing works on the use of data provided by [[earth observation satellite]]s and various airborne sensors to produce maps and spatial data for the evaluation and monitoring of [[natural resource]]s, natural hazards and management environmental. The sector of space sciences is concerned with the development of sensors for earth observation to be mounted on satellites and with all the problems involved with monitoring communication with satellites and retrieving the information for processing, and ultimately on launching an Egyptian remote sensing satellite.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

==Facilities==

Both the headquarters and the New Cairo space control station are located in Cairo. The receiving station is located in Aswan.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

==Satellites==
[[EgyptSat 1]] was a remote sensing satellite that was launched on 17 April 2007 at [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]]. Control and communication was lost July 2010.The satellite weighed 100 kg and contained a multi-spectral imager for Earth observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2007-012A|title=EgyptSat1|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=October 27, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329165838/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2007-012A|archivedate=March 29, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National University of Cuyo''' ({{lang-es|Universidad Nacional de Cuyo}}, UNCuyo) is the largest center of higher education in the [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]], [[Argentina]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

As of 2005, the university had 12 academic schools in the city of [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] and a delegation in the city of [[San Rafael, Mendoza|San Rafael]] (province of Mendoza), in addition to the [[Balseiro Institute]], which is the most developed institute of Physics research in Argentina, located in the city of [[San Carlos de Bariloche]] (province of [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]]). It includes the University Technological Institute which offers technical education in four other cities in Mendoza province. Moreover, UNCuyo is also devoted to improving education due to having 7 other buildings working as High Schools:

* C.U.C. (Colegio Universitario Central "Gral. Jose de San Martin")
* Escuela de Comercio Martín Zapata
* Liceo Agrícola Domingo Faustino Sarmiento
* Escuela del Magisterio
* Escuela de Agricultura
* D.A.D (Departamento de Aplicación Docente)
* Escuela Carmen Vera Arenas
[[File:Campus UNCuyo.jpg|thumb|Campus]]

==History==
The UNCuyo was established on March 21, 1939 by the presidential decree 26971. The university was established to offer tertiary education provision in the region of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] (the provinces of Mendoza, [[San Juan Province (Argentina)|San Juan]] and [[San Luis Province|San Luis]]). At its foundation the university was composed of some existing higher education colleges, and new ones were incorporated. Regional affiliations were established in Human Sciences, Medicine, Agronomy and Economics in Mendoza, Engineering and Architecture in San Juan, and Natural Sciences in San Luis. These links remained in place until 1973. That year the [[National University of San Juan]] and the [[National University of San Luis]] were established from the adjunct faculties of the National University of Cuyo already in these regions. Thereafter, the National University of Cuyo concentrated itself in Mendoza, in addition to a campus in Río Negro Province: the [[Balseiro Institute]].

==Recent research==
In recent research conducted by UNCuyo's students it was discovered how methods of cutting and preparing food can affect how many nutrients are retained in a meal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/diet.fitness/06/30/cl.bringing.out.best/index.html#cnnSTCText?iref=werecommend Coax flavor, nutrition from produce with proper care, handling]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably they found that the thiosulfinates (that inhibit platelet aggregation and microparticle shedding) found in garlic and onions do not form until crushing or cutting. The research also demonstrated that steaming instead boiling is preferable as vegetables retain more of their water-soluble vitamins.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4938">'''Out from Under: Disability, History and Things to Remember''' is a [[traveling exhibition]] that explores the [[history]] of [[disability]] within the lives of Canadians.

The exhibition was produced in collaboration with students, scholars and [[alumni]] from the School of Disability Studies at [[Ryerson University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofu.ryerson.ca/about/index.html |title=Out from Under: Disability, History and Things to Remember |publisher=Ryerson University |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition originated from a special topic seminar designed to uncover the hidden history of disability in Canada. Each student identified an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] to explore that represented a particular moment in Canadian disability history. Thirteen objects were then selected for the exhibition, revealing [[narratives]] that pay homage to the resilience, creativity, and the civic and cultural contributions of Canadians with disabilities. Accompanying interpretive texts help confront [[stereotypical]] representations of disability such as [[pity]], [[wikt:inspiration|inspiration]] or [[freak]], helping to illustrate the complexity of disability struggles for social and political acknowledgement, [[Identity (social science)|identity]], survival and remembrance.

Out from Under is curated by three [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] members from Ryerson University’s School of [[Disability Studies]].

==Exhibition components==
Each objects’ history is represented by a single word title: Digging, Labouring, Dressing, Fixing, Measuring, Naming, Breathing, Remembering, Packing, Trailblazing, Struggling, Leading and Aspiring.

==Accessibility features==
'''[[American Sign Language]]'''
[[Video]] [[podcast]] of all exhibit text in American Sign Language.

'''[[Audio description]] and [[Touch]] Stations'''
Audio podcasts of all exhibit [[Written language|text]] with detailed audio descriptions and touch stations profiling selected objects.

'''[[Braille]] Booklets'''
Braille copies of exhibit text including [[wikt:participation|participant]] profiles.

==Exhibition catalogue==

'''Overexploitation''', also called '''overharvesting''', refers to harvesting a [[renewable resource]] to the [[point of diminishing returns]]. Continued overexploitation can lead to the destruction of the resource. The term applies to [[natural resource]]s such as: wild [[medicinal plant]]s, [[Pasture|grazing pasture]]s, [[Game (food)|game animals]], [[fish stocks]], [[forests]], and [[Aquifer|water aquifers]].

In [[ecology]], overexploitation describes one of the five main activities threatening global [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=Wilcoveetal&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilcove |first=D. S. |first2=D. |last2=Rothstein |first3=J. |last3=Dubow |first4=A. |last4=Phillips |first5=E. |last5=Losos |year=1998 |title=Quantifying threats to imperiled species in the United States |journal=BioScience |volume=48 |issue= |pages=607–615 |doi=10.2307/1313420 |jstor= 1313420 |url= http://www.unc.edu/courses/2006spring/geog/144/001/www/readings/wilcove2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists use the term to describe populations that are harvested at a rate that is unsustainable, given their natural rates of mortality and capacities for reproduction. This can result in extinction at the population level and even extinction of whole species. In [[conservation biology]] the term is usually used in the context of human economic activity that involves the taking of biological resources, or organisms, in larger numbers than their populations can withstand.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford. (1996). Oxford Dictionary of Biology. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used and defined somewhat differently in [[fisheries]], [[hydrology]] and [[natural resource management]].

Overexploitation can lead to resource destruction, including [[extinction]]s. However it is also possible for overexploitation to be sustainable, as [[#Fisheries|discussed below]] in the section on fisheries. In the context of fishing, the term [[overfishing]] can be used instead of overexploitation, as can [[overgrazing]] in [[stock management]], [[overlogging]] in [[forest management]], [[overdrafting]] in [[aquifer]] management, and [[endangered species]] in species monitoring. Overexploitation is not an activity limited to humans. Introduced predators and herbivores, for example, can overexploit native [[flora]] and [[fauna]].

==History==
[[File:Giant Haasts eagle attacking New Zealand moa.jpg|thumb|right|When the giant flightless birds called [[moa]] were overexploited to the point of extinction,&lt;ref name=Holdaway /&gt; the giant [[Haast's eagle]] that preyed on them also became extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tennyson |first=A. |author2=Martinson, P. |year=2006 |title=Extinct Birds of New Zealand |publisher=Te Papa Press |location=Wellington, New Zealand |isbn=978-0-909010-21-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Concern about overexploitation is relatively recent, though overexploitation itself is not a new phenomenon. It has been observed for millennia. For example, ceremonial cloaks worn by the Hawaiian kings were made from the [[mamo]] bird; a single cloak used the feathers of 70,000 birds of this now-extinct species. The [[dodo]], a flightless bird from [[Mauritius]], is another well-known example of overexploitation.  As with many island species, it was naive about certain predators, allowing humans to approach and kill it with ease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Fryer |date=2002-09-14 |title=Bringing the dodo back to life |work=BBC News |accessdate=2006-09-07 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/2255991.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the earliest of times, [[hunting]] has been an important human activity as a means of survival. There is a whole history of overexploitation in the form of overhunting. The [[overkill hypothesis]] ([[Quaternary extinction event]]s) explains why the [[megafauna]]l extinctions occurred within a relatively short period of time. This can be traced with [[human migration]]. The most convincing evidence of this theory is that 80% of the North American large mammal species disappeared within 1000 years of the arrival of humans on the western hemisphere continents.&lt;ref&gt;Paul S. Martin&lt;/ref&gt;  The fastest ever recorded extinction of [[megafauna]] occurred in [[New Zealand]], where by 1500 AD, just 200 years after settling the islands, ten species of the giant [[Moa|moa birds]] were hunted to extinction by the [[Māori people|Māori]].&lt;ref name=Holdaway&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holdaway |first=R. N. |authorlink= |author2=Jacomb, C. |year=2000 |title=Rapid Extinction of the Moas (Aves: Dinornithiformes): Model, Test, and Implications |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/gibbs/efb413/moa.pdf |volume=287 |issue=5461 |pages=2250–2254 |doi=10.1126/science.287.5461.2250 |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=10731144 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527164824/http://www.esf.edu/efb/gibbs/efb413/moa.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-27 |df= |bibcode=2000Sci...287.2250H }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave of extinctions occurred later with European settlement.

In more recent times, overexploitation has resulted in the gradual emergence of the concepts of [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]], which has built on other concepts, such as [[sustainable yield]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Larkin |first=P.

==Overview==
Overexploitation doesn't necessarily lead to the destruction of the resource, nor is it necessarily unsustainable. However, [[resource depletion|depleting]] the numbers or amount of the resource can change its quality. For example, [[Livistona rotundifolia|footstool palm]] is a wild palm tree found in Southeast Asia. Its leaves are used for thatching and food wrapping, and overharvesting has resulted in its leaf size becoming smaller.

==Tragedy of the commons==
[[File:Cows on Selsley Common - geograph.org.uk - 192472.jpg|thumb|left|Cows on [[Selsley Common]]. The [[tragedy of the commons]] is a useful parable for understanding how overexploitation can occur.]]

The [[tragedy of the commons]] refers to a dilemma described in an article by that name written by [[Garrett Hardin]] and first published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1968.&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;{{cite journal |first=Garrett |last=Hardin |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |year=1968 |pages=1243–1248 |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |pmid=5699198|bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H }} Also available [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here].&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to [[Tragedy of the commons#Garrett Hardin's essay|Hardin's essay]] is an example which is a useful parable for understanding how overexploitation can occur. This example was first sketched in an 1833 pamphlet by [[William Forster Lloyd]], as a hypothetical and simplified situation based on medieval [[land tenure]] in Europe, of herders sharing a [[Common land|common]] on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze. In Hardin's example, it is in each herder's interest to put each succeeding cow he acquires onto the land, even if the [[carrying capacity]] of the common is exceeded and it is temporarily or permanently damaged for all as a result. The herder receives all of the benefits from an additional cow, while the damage to the common is shared by the entire group. If all herders make this individually rational economic decision, the common will be overexploited or even destroyed to the detriment of all. However, since all herders reach the same rational conclusion, overexploitation in the form of [[overgrazing]] occurs, with immediate losses, and the pasture may be degraded to the point where it gives very little return.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels him to increase his herd without limit—in a world that is limited. Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons." (Hardin, 1968)&lt;ref name=hardin68 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the course of his essay, Hardin develops the theme, drawing in many examples of latter day commons, such as [[national park]]s, the atmosphere, oceans, rivers and [[fish stocks]]. The example of fish stocks had led some to call this the "tragedy of the fishers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Samuel |last=Bowles |title=Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=27–29 |year=2004 |isbn=0-691-09163-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major theme running through the essay is the growth of human populations, with the [[Earth]]'s finite resources being the general common.

The tragedy of the commons has intellectual roots tracing back to [[Aristotle]], who noted that "what is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ostrom |first=E. |year=1992 |chapter=The rudiments of a theory of the origins, survival, and performance of common-property institutions |editor-first=D. W. |editor-last=Bromley |title=Making the Commons Work: Theory, Practice and Policy |location=San Francisco |publisher=ICS Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to [[Hobbes]] and his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feeny |first=D. |year=1990 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons: Twenty-two years later |journal=Human Ecology |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.1007/BF00889070 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite situation to a tragedy of the commons is sometimes referred to as a [[tragedy of the anticommons]]: a situation in which rational individuals, acting separately, collectively waste a given resource by underutilizing it.

The tragedy of the commons can be avoided if it is appropriately regulated. Hardin's use of "commons" has frequently been misunderstood, leading Hardin to later remark that he should have titled his work "The tragedy of the unregulated commons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fe20060726sh.html |title=Will commons sense dawn again in time? |work=The Japan Times Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fisheries==
[[File:Bluefin-big.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]] is currently seriously overexploited. Scientists say 7,500 tons annually is the sustainable limit, yet the fishing industry continue to harvest 60,000 tons.]]

In [[wild fisheries]], overexploitation or [[overfishing]] occurs when a [[fish stock]] has been fished down "below the size that, on average, would support the long-term [[maximum sustainable yield]] of the fishery".&lt;ref&gt;[[NOAA]]: [http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/fishwatch/glossary.htm ''FishWatch glossary''] Retrieved 2 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, overexploitation can be sustainable.

When a fishery starts harvesting fish from a previously unexploited stock, the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of the fish stock will decrease, since harvesting means fish are being removed. For sustainability, the rate at which the fish replenish biomass through reproduction must balance the rate at which the fish are being harvested. If the harvest rate is increased, then the stock biomass will further decrease. At a certain point, the maximum harvest yield that can be sustained will be reached, and further attempts to increase the harvest rate will result in the collapse of the fishery. This point is called the [[maximum sustainable yield]], and in practice, usually occurs when the fishery has been fished down to about 30% of the biomass it had before harvesting started.&lt;ref&gt;Bolden, E.G., Robinson, W.L. (1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=PL6r1Ir_x_oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Wildlife+ecology+and+management%22&amp;ei=ugW6SpjREJCINMbR1L8P#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Wildlife ecology and management''] 4th ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc. Upper Saddle River, NJ. {{ISBN|0-13-840422-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to fish the stock down further to, say, 15% of the pre-harvest biomass, and then adjust the harvest rate so the biomass remains at that level. In this case, the fishery is sustainable, but is now overexploited, because the stock has been run down to the point where the sustainable yield is less than it could be.

Fish stocks are said to "collapse" if their biomass declines by more than 95 percent of their maximum historical biomass. [[Atlantic cod]] stocks were severely overexploited in the 1970s and 1980s, leading to their abrupt collapse in 1992.&lt;ref name="Frank"/&gt; Even though fishing has ceased, the cod stocks have failed to recover.&lt;ref name=Frank/&gt; The absence of cod as the [[apex predator]] in many areas has led to [[trophic cascade]]s.&lt;ref name=Frank/&gt;

About 25% of world fisheries are now overexploited to the point where their current biomass is less than the level that maximizes their sustainable yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grafton | first1 = RQ | authorlink3 = Ray Hilborn | last2 = Kompas | first2 = T | last3 = Hilborn | first3 = RW | year = 2007 | title = Economics of Overexploitation Revisited | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/318/5856/1601 | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5856| page = 1601 | doi=10.1126/science.1146017 | bibcode=2007Sci...318.1601G | pmid=18063793}}&lt;/ref&gt; These depleted fisheries can often recover if fishing pressure is reduced until the stock biomass returns to the optimal biomass. At this point, harvesting can be resumed near the maximum sustainable yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = AA | year = 2003 | title = Managing to the margins: the overexploitation of fisheries | journal = Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 102–106 | doi = 10.1890/1540-9295(2003)001[0102:MTTMTO]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tragedy of the commons]] can be avoided within the context of fisheries if fishing effort and practices are regulated appropriately by [[fisheries management]]. One effective approach may be assigning some measure of ownership in the form of  [[individual transferable quota]]s (ITQs) to fishermen. In 2008, a large scale study of fisheries that used ITQs, and ones that didn't, provided strong evidence that ITQs help prevent collapses and restore fisheries that appear to be in decline.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/dn14762-guaranteed-fish-quotas-halt-commercial-freeforall.html  New Scientist: Guaranteed fish quotas halt commercial free-for-all]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;story_id=12253181 A Rising Tide: Scientists find proof that privatising fishing stocks can avert a disaster] The Economist, 18th Sept, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Water resources, such as [[lake]]s and [[aquifer]]s, are usually renewable resources which naturally recharge (the term [[fossil water]] is sometimes used to describe aquifers which don't recharge). Overexploitation occurs if a water resource, such as the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], is mined or extracted at a rate that exceeds the recharge rate, that is, at a rate that exceeds the practical sustained yield. Recharge usually comes from area streams, rivers and lakes. An aquifer which has been overexploited is said to be [[Overdrafting|overdrafted]] or depleted.  Forests enhance the recharge of [[aquifer]]s in some locales, although generally forests are a major source of aquifer depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|title=Underlying Causes of Deforestation: UN Report|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411092448/http://wrm.org.uy/deforestation/UNreport.html|archivedate=2001-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Conrad2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/byauthor/244797 |last= Conrad|first= C.|title= Forests of eucalyptus shadowed by questions |date= 2008-06-21|publisher= [[Arizona Daily Star]]|accessdate=2010-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206103926/http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/byauthor/244797 |archivedate=2008-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depleted aquifers can become polluted with contaminants such as [[nitrate]]s, or permanently damaged through subsidence or through saline intrusion from the ocean.

This has led to the concept of [[peak water]].

==Forest resources==
{{see|Overlogging}}
[[File:Gordon River Clearcut.jpg|thumb|right|Clear cutting of old growth forests in Canada.]]

[[Forest]]s are overexploited when they are [[Logging|logged]] at a rate faster than [[reforestation]] takes place. Reforestation competes with other land uses such as food production, livestock grazing, and living space for further economic growth. Historically utilization of forest products, including timber and fuel wood, have played a key role in human societies, comparable to the roles of water and cultivable land. Today, developed countries continue to utilize timber for building houses, and wood pulp for [[paper]]. In developing countries almost three billion people rely on wood for heating and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;http://atlas.aaas.org/pdf/63-66.pdf Forest Products&lt;/ref&gt; Short-term economic gains made by [[Deforestation|conversion of forest]] to agriculture, or overexploitation of wood products, typically leads to loss of long-term income and long term biological productivity. [[West Africa]], [[Madagascar]], [[Southeast Asia]] and many other regions have experienced lower revenue because of overexploitation and the consequent declining timber harvests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0905.htm|title=Destruction of Renewable Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endangered species==
[[File:Overgrazing.JPG|thumb|right|It is not just humans that overexploit resources. [[Overgrazing]] can be caused by native fauna, as shown in the upper right. However, past human overexploitation (leading to elimination of some predators) may be behind the situation.]]

Overexploitation threatens one-third of endangered [[vertebrate]]s, as well as other groups. Excluding edible fish, the illegal [[wildlife trade|trade in wildlife]] is valued at $10 billion per year.  Industries responsible for this include the trade in [[bushmeat]], the trade in [[Chinese medicine]], and the [[fur trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Hemley 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or [[CITES]] was set up in order to control and regulate the trade in endangered animals.  It currently protects, to a varying degree, some 33,000 species of animals and plants. It is estimated that a quarter of the endangered vertebrates in the United States of America and half of the endangered mammals is attributed to overexploitation.&lt;ref name=Wilcoveetal /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Primack |first=R. B. |year=2002 |title=Essentials of Conservation Biology |edition=3rd |location=Sunderland |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=0-87893-719-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All living organisms require resources to survive. Overexploitation of these resources for protracted periods can deplete natural stocks to the point where they are unable to recover within a short time frame. Humans have always harvested food and other resources they have needed to survive.  Human populations, historically, were small, and methods of collection limited to small quantities. With an exponential increase in human population, expanding markets and increasing demand, combined with improved access and techniques for capture, are causing the [[exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] of many species beyond sustainable levels.&lt;ref&gt;Redford 1992, Fitzgibon ''et al.'' 1995, Cuarón 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  In practical terms, if continued, it reduces valuable resources to such low levels that their exploitation is no longer sustainable and can lead to the [[extinction]] of a species, in addition to having dramatic, unforeseen [[keystone species|effects]], on the [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frankham |first=R. |last2=Ballou |first2=J. D. |last3=Briscoe |first3=D. A. |year=2002 |title=Introduction to Conservation Genetics |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-63014-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overexploitation often occurs rapidly as markets open, utilising previously untapped resources, or locally used species.

Today, overexploitation and misuse of natural resources is an ever-present threat for [[species richness]].  This is more prevalent when looking at [[island ecology]] and the species that inhabit them, as islands can be viewed as the world in miniature.  Island [[Endemism|endemic]] populations are more prone to [[extinction]] from overexploitation, as they often exist at low densities with reduced reproductive rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dowding |first=J.

Chapman and Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

As another example, when the humble [[Erinaceus europaeus|hedgehog]] was introduced to the Scottish island of [[Uist]], the population greatly expanded and took to consuming and overexploiting shorebird eggs, with drastic consequences for their breeding success.  Twelve species of [[Bird|avifauna]] are affected, with some species numbers being reduced by 39%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jackson |first=D. B. |last2=Fuller |first2=R. J. |last3=Campbell |first3=S. T. |title=Long-term Population Changes Among Breeding Shorebirds in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland, In Relation to Introduced Hedgehogs (''Erinaceus europaeus'') |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=117 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=151–166 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(03)00289-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there is substantial human migration, civil unrest, or war, controls may no longer exist.  With civil unrest, for example in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] and [[Rwanda]], firearms have become common and the breakdown of food distribution networks in such countries leaves the resources of the natural environment vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=R. F. |year=1990 |title=Farewell to Africa |journal=Audubon |volume=92 |issue= |pages=1547–1551 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals are even killed as target practice, or simply to spite the government.  Populations of large primates, such as [[gorilla]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s, [[ungulate]]s and other mammals, may be reduced by 80% or more by hunting, and certain species may be eliminated altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilkie |first=D.

Overall, 50 bird species that have become extinct since 1500 (approximately 40% of the total) have been subject to overexploitation,&lt;ref&gt;The LUCN Red List of Threatened Species (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; including:

* [[Pinguinus impennis|Great Auk]] – the penguin-like bird of the north, was hunted for its feathers, meat, fat and oil.
* [[Carolina parakeet]] – The only parrot species native to the eastern United States, was hunted for crop protection and its feathers.

Other species affected by overexploitation include: 

* The international trade in fur: [[chinchilla]], [[vicuña]], [[giant otter]] and numerous cat species
* Insect collectors: butterflies
* Horticulturists: New Zealand mistletoe (''Trilepidia adamsii''), orchids, cacti and many other plant species
* Shell collectors: Marine [[mollusc]]s

==Cascade effects==
[[Image:Kelp forest.jpg|thumb|left|Overexploiting [[sea otter]]s resulted in [[cascade effect]]s which destroyed [[kelp forest]] ecosystems.]]

Overexploitation of species can result in knock-on or [[cascade effect]]s. This can particularly apply if, through overexploitation, a habitat loses its [[apex predator]]. Because of the loss of the top predator, a [[Overpopulation in wild animals|dramatic increase]] in their [[prey]] species can occur. In turn, the unchecked prey can then overexploit their own food resources until population numbers dwindle, possibly to the point of extinction.

A classic example of cascade effects occurred with [[sea otters]]. Starting before the 17th century and not phased out until 1911, sea otters were hunted aggressively for their exceptionally warm and valuable pelts, which could fetch up to $2500 US. This caused cascade effects through the [[kelp forest]] ecosystems along the Pacific Coast of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Estes |first=J. A. |first2=D. O. |last2=Duggins |first3=G. B. |last3=Rathbun |year=1989 |title=The ecology of extinctions in kelp forest communities |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=251–264 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1989.tb00085.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the sea otters’ primary food sources is the [[sea urchin]]. When hunters caused sea otter populations to decline, an [[ecological release]] of sea urchin populations occurred. The sea urchins then overexploited their main food source, [[kelp]], creating urchin barrens, areas of seabed denuded of kelp, but carpeted with urchins. No longer having food to eat, the sea urchin became [[locally extinct]] as well. Also, since kelp forest ecosystems are homes to many other species, the loss of the kelp caused other cascade effects of secondary extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dayton |first=P. K. |first2=M. J. |last2=Tegner |first3=P. B. |last3=Edwards |first4=K. L. |last4=Riser |year=1998 |title=Sliding baselines, ghosts, and reduced expectations in kelp forest communities |journal=Ecol.

In 1911, when only one small group of 32 sea otters survived in a remote cove, an international treaty was signed to prevent further exploitation of the sea otters. Under heavy protection, the otters multiplied and repopulated the depleted areas, which slowly recovered. More recently, with declining numbers of fish stocks, again due to overexploitation, [[Orcinus orca|killer whales]] have experienced a food shortage and have been observed feeding on sea otters, again reducing their numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krebs |first=C. J. |year=2001 |title=Ecology |edition=5th |location=San Francisco |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |isbn=0-321-04289-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Popular culture studies''' is the [[academic discipline]] studying [[popular culture]] from a [[critical theory]] perspective. It is generally considered as a combination of [[communication studies]] and [[cultural studies]]. The first department to offer Popular Culture bachelor's and master's degrees is the [[Bowling Green State University Department of Popular Culture]] which was founded by [[Ray B. Browne]].&lt;ref name="raybrowne"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/education/28browne.html?_r=0 | title=Ray Browne, 87, Founder of Pop-Culture Studies, Dies | publisher=[[New York Times]] | date=27 October 2009 | accessdate=12 March 2014 | author=Fox, Margalit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the work of the [[Frankfurt School]], popular culture has come to be taken more seriously as a terrain of academic inquiry and has also helped to change the outlooks of more established disciplines. Conceptual barriers between so-called [[high culture|high]] and [[low culture]] have broken down, accompanying an explosion in scholarly interest in popular culture, which encompasses such diverse media as [[comic books]], [[television]], and the [[Internet]]. Reevaluation of mass culture in the 1970s and 1980s has revealed significant problems with the traditional view of mass culture as degraded and elite culture as uplifting. Divisions between high and low culture have been increasingly seen as political distinctions rather than defensible aesthetic or intellectual ones.&lt;ref&gt;Mukerji &amp; Schudson 1991:1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional theories of popular culture==

===The theory of mass society===
[[Mass society]] formed during the 19th-century [[industrialization]] process through the [[division of labor]], the large-scale industrial organization, the concentration of urban populations, the growing centralization of decision making, the development of a complex and international communication system and the growth of mass political movements. The term "mass society", therefore, was introduced by [[anticapitalism|anticapitalist]], aristocratic ideologists and used against the values and practices of industrialized society. Theories of popular culture are often subjected to bias and originate from a generalist perspective.

As [[Alan Swingewood]] points out in ''The Myth of Mass Culture'',&lt;ref&gt;Swingewood 1977:5-8&lt;/ref&gt; the aristocratic theory of mass society is to be linked to the moral crisis caused by the weakening of traditional centers of authority such as family and religion. The society predicted by [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and others would be dominated by philistine masses, without centers or hierarchies of moral or cultural authority. In such a society, art can only survive by cutting its links with the masses, by withdrawing as an asylum for threatened values. Throughout the 20th century, this type of theory has modulated on the opposition between disinterested, pure autonomous art and commercialized mass culture.

===The theory of culture industry===
Diametrically opposed to the aristocratic view would be the theory of [[culture industry]] developed by [[Frankfurt School]] [[critical theorists]] such as [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]]. In their view, the masses are precisely dominated by an all-encompassing culture industry obeying only to the logic of [[consumer capitalism]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s concept of hegemony (see: [[cultural hegemony]]), that is, the domination of society by a specific group which stays in power by partially taking care of and partially repressing the claims of other groups, does not work here anymore. The principle of hegemony as a goal to achieve for an oppressed [[social class]] loses its meaning. The system has taken over; only the state apparatus dominates.

===The theory of progressive evolution===
A third view on popular culture, which fits in the liberal-pluralist ideology and is often called "progressive evolutionism", is overtly optimistic. It sees capitalist economy as creating opportunities for every individual to participate in a culture which is fully democratized through mass education, expansion of leisure time and cheap records and paperbacks. As Swingewood points out in ''The Myth of Mass Culture'',&lt;ref&gt;Swingewood 1977:22&lt;/ref&gt; there is no question of domination here anymore. In this view, popular culture does not threaten [[high culture]], but is an authentic expression of the needs of the people.

==Contemporary popular culture studies==
Aside from precursors such as [[Umberto Eco]] and [[Roland Barthes]], popular culture studies as we know them today were developed in the late seventies and the eighties. The first influential works were generally politically left-wing and rejected the "aristocratic" view. However, they also criticized the pessimism of the Frankfurt School: contemporary studies on mass culture accept that, apparently, popular culture forms do respond to widespread needs of the public. They also emphasized the capacity of the consumers to resist indoctrination and passive reception. Finally, they avoided any monolithic concept of mass culture. Instead they tried to describe culture as a whole as a complex formation of [[discourse]]s which correspond to particular interests, and which can be dominated by specific groups, but which also always are dialectically related to their producers and consumers.

An example of this tendency is Andrew Ross's ''No Respect. Intellectuals and Popular Culture'' (1989). His chapter on the history of jazz, blues and rock does not present a linear narrative opposing the authentic [[popular music]] to the commercial record industry, but shows how popular music in the U.S., from the twenties until today, evolved out of complex interactions between [[Popular culture|popular]], [[avant-garde]] and [[commerce|commercial]] circuits, between lower- and middle-class youth, between [[African American|blacks]] and [[whites]].

===Traces of the theory of culture industry===
{{Cleanup|section|date=July 2010}}
Still the traditional views have a long life.&lt;ref&gt;overview based on Clem Robyns, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The theory which has been abandoned most massively is the monolithic, [[Cultural pessimism|pessimistic]] view on the culture industry of the [[Frankfurt School]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}{{Dubious|date=July 2010}} However, it is still hotly debated. The criticism raised can be summarized in three main arguments. First of all, the culture industry theory has completely abandoned the [[Marxist]] [[dialectic]] conception of society. Every impulse, according to this view, comes from above. Resistance and contradiction are impossible, and the audience is manipulated into passivity. Alan Swingewood and others emphasize that the Frankfurt theory has to be seen in the light of left-wing frustrations about the failure of proletarian revolutions early this century, and the easy submission of the European nations to [[fascism]].

A second reproach is that this view may be as elitist as its aristocratic counterpart. Both establish the lonely, autonomous, avant-garde intellectual as the only light in a zombie society. Thus the former Marxists arrive at an uncritical praise of the elitist and antirevolutionary upper-class culture. This brings us to a third argument, already made in the sixties by [[Umberto Eco]].&lt;ref&gt;Eco 1988&lt;/ref&gt; In a state-dominated mass society, the lonely, lucid, intellectual [[Übermensch]] can only retreat in his ivory tower. The historicity of the contemporary situation is not taken into account, so its internal contradictions are ignored, and thus revolution can only be seen as purely utopian. The culture industry theory, therefore, would lead to passivity and thereby becomes an objective ally of the system it pretends to criticize.

It is of course mainly the influence exercised by the Frankfurt School which matters here: not all of their texts present the same rigid view. In ''Das Schema der Massenkultur'',&lt;ref&gt;Adorno 1973-1986:331&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, Adorno discusses a "nucleus of individuality" that the culture industry cannot manipulate, and which forces him to continuously repeat his manipulation.

However questioned this view on popular culture may be, it still leaves some traces, for instance, in theories depicting [[narrative]] as necessarily ideologically conservative, like Charles Grivel's ''Production de l'intérêt romanesque''.&lt;ref&gt;Grivel 1973&lt;/ref&gt; Such theories see dominant ideology as purely a matter of messages, propagated in this case through the forms of narrative fiction. Thus they easily arrive at an exaltation of experimental literature as necessarily revolutionary. However, they may neglect the fact that the ideology is never simply in the message, but in the position of the message in the general social discourse, and in the position of its producers in the social formation.

Other theories easily yielding to monolithic thought stem from the emancipation movements of oppressed groups. Early [[feminist theory]], for instance, often described society as universally and transhistorically dominated by patriarchy in every aspect of life, thereby presenting a pejorative view of the women they claim to defend. As Andrew Ross&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1989&lt;/ref&gt; argues, the same remark goes for the widely accepted account of rock history as a continuous appropriation of [[Afro-American music|black music]] by a white [[music industry]]. Only studies analyzing the cultural oppression of homosexuality seem to take a less deterministic position.

===Contemporary liberal pluralism===
In liberal-pluralist accounts of popular culture, the theorizing on its supposedly liberating, democratizing function is nowadays most often pushed to the background. This type of criticism, often produced by people who are also active in popular literary writing themselves, often amounts to paraphrase and suffers from an uncritical identification with the study object. One of the main aims of this type of criticism is the establishment of ahistorical [[wiktionary:canon|canon]]s of and within popular genres in the image of legitimized culture. This approach, however, has been accused of [[elitism]] as well.

To put it simply: the [[intellectual]], in this view, can fully enjoy junk culture because of his or her high culture background, but the average reader can never raise to the learned intellectual discourse of which he or she is the object. An example of this form of appropriation is Thomas Roberts's ''An Aesthetics of Junk Fiction'' (1990). Though Roberts claims to take a distance from studies of canonical fiction, he justifies his (implicit) decision to impose canonical models on [[popular fiction]] as follows: "If people who read [[Goethe]] and [[Alessandro Manzoni]] and [[Pushkin]] with pleasure are also reading [[detective fiction]] with pleasure, there is more in the detective story than its critics have recognized, perhaps more than even its writers and readers have recognized",&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 1989:5&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrates a frequent strategy: the legitimation of popular fiction on the basis of its use of canonized [[literary fiction]], and of the legitimized public's response to it.

If we consider all the views depicted in the present article as instances of both the thesis and the antithesis of an argument, it is a less known scholar, [[Blanca de Lizaur]] who manages to finally produce the synthesis. In the sociological line of Mims and Lerner, she sees Literature as a ''necessary'' social institution -id est: fulfilling an essential social need: That of explaining, justifying and promoting its society's world-view, values, ideas and beliefs, through depicting them "in action" in lyrics and narratives from which we all learn. Not only this: The expression of the feelings that may be expected to accompany depicted actions and events, also constitutes a fundamental part of its social role, as we naturally expect Literature to constructively account for, inform, modulate and educate our feelings. Hence why Literature is present in every human culture, all along history.

Because of its fundamental role and our need for it, Literature will always find its way to, and adapt to the latest technologies and to the furthest reaching distribution channels available. It is also because of this reason that works that successfully represent their audiences' values, ideas and beliefs, and attain commercial success, will at the same time become the subject of unsurmountable pressures -...losing success once power actors manage to substitute their society's message for their own.

De Lizaur, emerging from the field of Literary Studies, also developed a full literary theory that accounts for popular works' aesthetics, strategies, resources, genres, and meaningful criticism, as opposed to ideologized or prejudiced criticism.

===Contemporary apocalyptic thought===
[[Image:MarshallMcLuhan.png|thumb|205px|right|[[Marshall McLuhan]] caused wide irritation with his statement that the traditional, book-oriented intellectuals had become irrelevant for the formulation of cultural rules in the [[electronic age]].]]
Equally alive is the aristocratic apocalyptic view on mass culture as the destruction of genuine art. As Andrew Ross&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1989:5&lt;/ref&gt; writes, a history of popular culture is also a history of intellectuals, of cultural experts whose self-assigned task it is to define the borders between the popular and the legitimate. But in contemporary society the dispersed authority is ever more exercised by "technical" intellectuals working for specific purposes and not for mankind. And in the academic world, growing attention for popular and marginal cultures threatens the absolute values on which intellectuals have built their autonomy.

In the sixties, [[Marshall McLuhan]] caused wide irritation with his statement that the traditional, book-oriented intellectuals had become irrelevant for the formulation of cultural rules in the electronic age. This is not to say that they lost any real political power, which humanist intellectuals as such hardly ever had. It does mean, however, that they are losing control of their own field, the field of art, of restricted symbolical production ([[Pierre Bourdieu]]). While in the 19th century, intellectuals managed to construct art as a proper, closed domain in which only the in-crowd was allowed to judge, they have seen this autonomy become ever more threatened by 20th-century mass society. The main factor here was not the quantitative expansion of consumption culture, nor the intrusion of commerce into the field of art through the appearance of paperbacks and [[Book sales club|book clubs]]. After all, protecting art from simplicity and commerce was precisely the task intellectuals set for themselves.

More important is the disappearance of what has been called the [[Metanarrative|"grand narratives"]] during this century, the questioning of all-encompassing world views offering coherent interpretations of the world and unequivocal guides for action. As Jim Collins argues in Uncommon Cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Collins 1989:2&lt;/ref&gt; there is no master's voice anymore, but only a decentralized assemblage of conflicting voices and institutions. The growing awareness of the historical and cultural variability of moral categories had to be a problem for an intellectual class which had based its position on the defense of secular but transhistorical values.

This brings us to a second problem humanist intellectuals face, that is, the fragmentation of the public. 19th-century intellectuals could still tell themselves that they were either writing for their colleagues, or teaching the undifferentiated masses. 20th-century intellectuals face a heterogeneous whole of groups and media producing their own discourses according to their own logic and interests. Thus they cannot control the reception of their own messages anymore, and thereby see their influence on the structuring of culture threatened. Many neo-apocalyptic intellectuals, such as [[Alain Finkielkraut]] and [[George Steiner]], emphasize their concern about the growing "illiteracy" of the masses. In practice they seem to be mainly concerned with high culture illiteracy, the inability to appreciate difficult art and literary classics.

The neo-aristocratic defense of so-called transhistorical and universal human values may also often be linked to a conservative political project. A return to universal values implies the delegitimation of any group which does not conform to those values. It is no coincidence, therefore, that attempts in the United States to define a common "American cultural legacy" tend to neglect the cultures of ethnic minority groups. Or that the fight against [[franglais]] (French "contaminated" by American English) in France was mainly fought by intellectuals seeing their traditional position in French society threatened by the import of American cultural products, as Clem Robyns&lt;ref&gt;Robyns 1995&lt;/ref&gt; describes.

==Recurring issues in popular culture studies==

===The interactions between popular and legitimized culture===
The blurring of the boundaries between [[high culture|high]] and [[low culture]] is one of the main complaints made by traditional intellectuals about contemporary mass society.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, John Edgar. “Horror and the Gothic’s utility as a cultural resource and critical tool.” ''Palgrave Communications'' 4 (2018): 1-4. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-018-0092-x.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of sociological studies on literary institutions which are held responsible for this mix.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Among the first were commercial [[Book sales club|book clubs]], such as the [[Book of the Month Club|Book-of-the-Month-Club]], appearing from the twenties on. The aggressive reactions they provoked are described by [[Janice Radway]]&lt;ref&gt;Radway 1989&lt;/ref&gt; in "The Scandal of the Middlebrow". According to Radway, the book clubs were perceived as scandalous because they blurred some basic distinctions of cultural discourse. In a society haunted by the spectre of cultural standardization and leveling towards below, they dared to put "serious" fiction on the same level as detective stories, adventure stories, biographies and popular nonfiction. Book clubs were scandalous because they created a space where high and low could meet.

Soon, the term "[[middlebrow]]" was introduced to qualify this phenomenon and to dismiss it as a threat to the authenticity of both high and popular culture. After the book clubs came the mass-production of the [[paperback]] format, and its influence was even more wide-ranging. More about this can be found in Thomas Bonn's book.&lt;ref&gt;Bonn 1989&lt;/ref&gt; It shows through what elaborate strategies the respectable hardcover editors had to go in order to hide the fact that, from the sixties on, paperback publishers had taken over the control on the production of serious literature.

===The possibility of a "subversive" popular culture===
The question whether popular culture or mass culture is inherently conservative, or whether it can be used in a [[Subversion (political)|subversive]] strategy as well,&lt;ref&gt;Browning 2018: 3&lt;/ref&gt; is equally hotly debated. It seems widely accepted that popular culture forms can function at any moment as anti-cultures. [[taste (aesthetics)|"Bad taste"]] products such as [[pornography]] and [[horror fiction]], says for instance Andrew Ross,&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1989:231&lt;/ref&gt; draw their popular appeal precisely from their expressions of disrespect for the imposed lessons of educated taste. They are expressions of social resentment on the part of groups which have been subordinated and excluded by today's "civilized society".

The question whether popular culture can actually resist dominant ideology, or even contribute to social change, is much more difficult to answer. Many critics easily read popular fiction and film as "attacks against the system", neglecting both the exact ways in which the so-called revolutionary message is enacted, and the capacities of dominant doctrines to recuperate critical messages. Tania Modleski in "The Terror of Pleasure",&lt;ref&gt;Modleski 1986:159&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, presents [[Exploitation film|exploitation horror films]] as attacks on the basic aspects of bourgeois culture. Thus a loving father cannibalizes his child, and priests turn into servants of the devil. Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Clem Robyns 1991&lt;/ref&gt; claim that, by presenting their [[perversion]] as supernatural, or at least pathological, [[horror film]]s precisely contribute to perpetuating those institutions.

Similarly, many critics exalt stories which feature a lone hero fighting for his ideals against an inert and amoral system. Thus Jim Collins in ''Uncommon Cultures''&lt;ref&gt;Collins 1989:30-31&lt;/ref&gt; sees [[crime fiction]] opposing a smart private detective and an inefficient police force as a critique of state justice. On the other hand, Thomas Roberts demonstrates in ''An Aesthetics of Junk Fiction'',&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 1990:173-174&lt;/ref&gt; a study of the historical background of the private detective model, how the detective story came into existence in the middle of the 19th century, at the time the institution of state police was developed. This force consisted mainly of lower-class people, but nevertheless disposed of a certain authority over the upper class. The fears among the upper classes for this uncontrolled force were eased by domesticating the police in stories explicitly devoted to them. Their inability to pass on correct judgment was amply demonstrated, and forced them to bow for the individual intellect of the detective, who always belonged to the threatened upper class.

Finally, Umberto Eco's studies on [[Superman]] and [[James Bond]]&lt;ref&gt;Eco 1988:211-256, 315-362&lt;/ref&gt; as myths of a static good-and-evil world view should be mentioned as very early and lucid examples of a combination of [[semiotic]] and political analysis.

Still, there may be ways to wage revolt in an age of [[mass media]]. One way could be to introduce small gradual changes in products otherwise conforming to the requirements of a dominant ideology. The problem here, of course, is that isolated messages get drowned in the discourse as a whole, and that they can be used to avoid real changes. Some scholars, however, describe how opposition forces use the logic of the media to subvert them. In ''No Respect'',&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1989:123&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Ross mentions the late sixties [[Yippie]] movement. Yippies would stage media events, such as the public burning of dollar bills in [[Wall Street]], thereby drawing heavy media coverage. This politics of the spectacle brought the [[counterculture]] right into the conservative media and filled their forms with subversive content.

Whether this strategy is effective or not, it points to an important fact: the mass media are not above, but dependent on the public. As Alan Swingewood states in ''The Myth of Mass Culture'',&lt;ref&gt;Swingewood 1977:84&lt;/ref&gt; the ideological messages the mass media receive are already mediated by a complex network of institutions and discourses. The media, themselves divided over innumerable specific discourses, transform them again. And finally the public meaningfully relates those messages to individual existences through the mediation of social groups, family networks, etc., which they belong to.

{{Rights}}

'''Rights''' are [[law|legal]], social, or [[ethics|ethical]] [[principle]]s of [[Liberty|freedom]] or [[entitlement]]; that is, rights are the fundamental [[normative]] rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt; Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as [[law]] and [[ethics]], especially theories of [[justice]] and [[deontology]].
 
Rights are often considered fundamental to [[civilization]], for they are regarded as established pillars of [[society]] and [[culture]],&lt;ref&gt;UN [[UDHR]] Preamble: "Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world..."&lt;/ref&gt; and the history of [[social conflict]]s can be found in the history of each right and its development. According to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "rights structure the form of [[government]]s, the content of [[laws]], and the shape of [[morality]] as it is currently perceived".&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt;

==Definitional issues==
[[File:RNC 04 protest 89.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Street protest scene; people deliberately lying down on a busy city street, surrounded by onlookers and police|Rights are widely regarded as the basis of law, but what if laws are bad? Some theorists suggest [[civil disobedience]] is, itself, a ''right'', and it was advocated by thinkers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]].]]
There is considerable disagreement about what is meant precisely by the term ''rights''. It has been used by different groups and thinkers for different purposes, with different and sometimes opposing definitions, and the precise definition of this principle, beyond having something to do with normative rules of some sort or another, is controversial.

One way to get an idea of the multiple understandings and senses of the term is to consider different ways it is used. Many diverse things are claimed as rights: {{cquote|A right to life, a right to choose; a right to vote, to work, to strike; a right to one phone call, to dissolve parliament, to operate a forklift, to asylum, to equal treatment before the law, to feel proud of what one has done; a right to exist, to sentence an offender to death, to launch a nuclear first strike, to carry a concealed weapon, to a distinct genetic identity; a right to believe one's own eyes, to pronounce the couple husband and wife, to be left alone, to go to hell in one's own way.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg&gt;{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = Rights dominate most modern understandings of what actions are proper and which institutions are just. Rights structure the forms of our governments, the contents of our laws, and the shape of morality as we perceive it. To accept a set of rights is to approve a distribution of freedom and authority, and so to endorse a certain view of what may, must, and must not be done.
|publisher = ''Stanford University''
|date = July 9, 2007
|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/
|accessdate = 2009-12-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are likewise diverse possible ways to categorize rights, such as:
{{cquote|''Who'' is alleged to have the right: Children's rights, animal rights, workers' rights, states' rights, the rights of peoples. ''What actions or states or objects'' the asserted right pertains to: Rights of free expression, to pass judgment; rights of privacy, to remain silent; property rights, bodily rights. ''Why'' the rightholder (allegedly) has the right: Moral rights spring from moral reasons, legal rights derive from the laws of the society, customary rights are aspects of local customs. ''How the asserted right can be affected'' by the rightholder's actions: The inalienable right to life, the forfeitable right to liberty, and the waivable right that a promise be kept.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt;}}
There has been considerable debate about what this term means within the academic community, particularly within fields such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[deontology]], [[logic]], [[political science]], and [[religion]].

===Natural versus legal===
[[File:Brueghel Jan II God creating.jpg|thumb|right|alt=painting of dark gray skies with trees and water, and a human image, flying, with arms outstretched|According to some views, certain rights derive from [[deities]] or [[nature]]]]
{{Main|Natural and legal rights}}
* '''Natural rights''' are rights which are "natural" in the sense of "not artificial, not man-made", as in rights deriving from [[human nature]] or from the [[divine command theory|edicts of a god]]. They are universal; that is, they apply to all people, and do not derive from the laws of any specific society. They exist necessarily, inhere in every individual, and can't be taken away. For example, it has been argued that humans have a natural ''right to life''. These are sometimes called ''[[natural and legal rights|moral rights]]'' or ''inalienable rights''.
* '''Legal rights''', in contrast, are based on a society's customs, laws, [[statute]]s or actions by [[legislature]]s. An example of a legal right is the ''right to vote'' of citizens. [[Citizenship]], itself, is often considered as the basis for having legal rights, and has been defined as the "right to have rights". Legal rights are sometimes called ''[[civil rights]]'' or ''statutory rights'' and are culturally and politically [[moral relativism|relative]] since they depend on a specific societal context to have meaning.

Some thinkers see rights in only one sense while others accept that both senses have a measure of validity. There has been considerable philosophical debate about these senses throughout history. For example, [[Jeremy Bentham]] believed that legal rights were the essence of rights, and he denied the existence of natural rights; whereas [[Thomas Aquinas]] held that rights purported by [[positive law]] but not grounded in [[natural law]] were not properly rights at all, but only a facade or pretense of rights.

===Claim versus liberty===
[[File:Chorin deed 1273.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a deed which has hand-written writing on a yellowed piece of paper with three gold tassles at the bottom|A [[deed]] is an example of a ''claim right'' in the sense that it asserts a ''right'' to own land. This particular deed dates back to 1273.]]
{{Main|Claim rights and liberty rights}}
* A '''claim right''' is a right which entails that another person has a duty to the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain from doing something to or for the ''claim holder'', such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a ''claim'' to that service or product (another term is ''[[thing in action]]'').&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;Fagan, Andrew. "Human Rights". ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' http://www.iep.utm.edu/hum-rts/#SH3b&lt;/ref&gt; In logic, this idea can be expressed as: "Person ''A'' has a claim that person ''B'' do something if and only if ''B'' has a duty to ''A'' to do that something." Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like "life, liberty, and property"; these rights impose an obligation upon others ''not'' to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be provided with those services.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* A '''liberty right''' or ''privilege'', in contrast, is simply a freedom or permission for the right-holder to do something, and there are ''no obligations'' on other parties to do or not do anything.&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt; This can be expressed in logic as: "Person ''A'' has a privilege to do something if and only if ''A'' has no duty not to do that something." For example, if a person has a legal liberty right to free speech, that merely means that it is not legally forbidden for them to speak freely: it does ''not'' mean that anyone has to help enable their speech, or to listen to their speech; or even, per se, refrain from stopping them from speaking, though ''other'' rights, such as the claim right to be free from assault, may severely limit what others can do to stop them.

Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so. Likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, then that other person's liberty is limited. For example, a person has a ''liberty right'' to walk down a sidewalk and can decide freely whether or not to do so, since there is no obligation either to do so or to refrain from doing so. But pedestrians may have an obligation not to walk on certain lands, such as other people's private property, to which those other people have a claim right. So a person's ''liberty right'' of walking extends precisely to the point where another's ''claim right'' limits his or her freedom.

===Positive versus negative===
{{Main|Negative and positive rights}}
In one sense, a right is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific service or treatment from others, and these rights have been called ''positive rights''. However, in another sense, rights may allow or require inaction, and these are called ''negative rights''; they permit or require doing nothing. For example, in some countries, e.g. the [[United States]], citizens have the ''positive right'' to vote and they have the ''negative right'' to not vote; people can choose not to vote in a given election without punishment. In other countries, e.g. [[Australia]], however, citizens have a positive right to vote but they don't have a negative right to not vote, since [[compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]]. Accordingly:
* '''Positive rights''' are permissions to do things, or entitlements to be done unto. One example of a positive right is the purported "right to welfare."&lt;ref name=tws21decgkfjf/&gt;
* '''Negative rights''' are permissions not to do things, or entitlements to be left alone. Often the distinction is invoked by [[libertarianism|libertarians]] who think of a ''negative right'' as an entitlement to non-interference such as a right against being assaulted.&lt;ref name=tws21decgkfjf&gt;{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = A distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among some normative theorists, especially those with a bent toward libertarianism. The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right.
|publisher = ''Stanford University''
|date = July 9, 2007
|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/
|accessdate = 2009-12-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though similarly named, positive and negative rights should not be confused with ''active rights'' (which encompass "privileges" and "powers") and ''passive rights'' (which encompass "claims" and "immunities").

===Individual versus group===
{{Main|Individual and group rights}}
The general concept of rights is that they are possessed by individuals in the sense that they are permissions and entitlements to do things which other persons, or which governments or authorities, can not infringe. This is the understanding of people such as the author [[Ayn Rand]] who argued that only individuals have rights, according to her philosophy known as [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].&lt;ref name=tws18decafafa&gt;{{cite news
|author = Ayn Rand
|title = The Virtue of Selfishness: Individual Rights
|quote = Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual). see page 104. See also: [[Group rights#Objectivist view|Collectivized 'Rights]]
|publisher = ''The Ayn Rand Lexicon''
|date = 2009-12-18
|url = http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html
|accessdate = 2009-12-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have argued that there are situations in which a group of persons is thought to have rights, or ''group rights''. Accordingly:
* '''Individual rights''' are rights held by individual people regardless of their group membership or lack thereof.
[[File:Malian Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Soldiers lined up in a row, with green caps, carrying rifles|Do groups have ''rights''? Some argue that when soldiers bond in [[combat]], the group becomes like an organism in itself and has ''rights'' which trump the rights of any individual soldier.]]
* '''Group rights''' have been argued to exist when a group is seen as more than a mere composite or assembly of separate individuals but an entity in its own right. In other words, it's possible to see a group as a distinct being in and of itself; it's akin to an enlarged individual, a corporate body, which has a distinct will and power of action and can be thought of as having ''rights''. For example, a platoon of soldiers in [[combat]] can be thought of as a distinct group, since individual members are willing to risk their lives for the survival of the group, and therefore the group can be conceived as having a "right" which is superior to that of any individual member; for example, a soldier who disobeys an officer can be punished, perhaps even killed, for a breach of obedience.  But there is another sense of group rights in which people who are members of a group can be thought of as having specific individual rights because of their membership in a group. In this sense, the set of rights which individuals-as-group-members have is expanded because of their membership in a group. For example, workers who are members of a group such as a [[Trade union|labor union]] can be thought of as having expanded individual rights because of their membership in the labor union, such as the rights to specific working conditions or wages. As expected, there is sometimes considerable disagreement about what exactly is meant by the term "group" as well as by the term "group rights."{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

There can be tension between individual and group rights. A classic instance in which group and individual rights clash is conflicts between unions and their members. For example, individual members of a union may wish a wage higher than the union-negotiated wage, but are prevented from making further requests; in a so-called [[closed shop]] which has a [[union security agreement]], only the union has a ''right'' to decide matters for the individual union members such as wage rates. So, do the supposed "individual rights" of the workers prevail about the proper wage? Or do the "group rights" of the union regarding the proper wage prevail? Clearly this is a source of tension.

The [[Austrian School|Austrian School of Economics]] holds that only individuals think, feel, and act whether or not members of any abstract group. The society should thus according to economists of the school be analyzed starting from the individual. This methodology is called [[methodological individualism]] and is used by the economists to justify [[individual rights]].

===Other senses===
Other distinctions between rights draw more on historical association or [[family resemblance]] than on precise philosophical distinctions. These include the distinction between '''[[civil and political rights]]''' and '''[[economic, social and cultural rights]]''', between which the articles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] are often divided. Another conception of rights groups them into '''[[three generations of human rights|three generations]]'''. These distinctions have much overlap with that between [[negative and positive rights]], as well as between [[individual rights]] and [[group rights]], but these groupings are not entirely coextensive.

==Politics==
[[File:Man being arrested.jpg|thumb|right|alt=three police officers surround a man in a tee shirt who is handcuffed|In the [[United States]], persons who are going to be questioned by police when they are in police custody must be read their "Miranda rights". The [[Miranda warning]] requires police officers to read a statement to people being arrested which informs them that they have certain rights, such as the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney.]]
Rights are often included in the foundational questions that governments and politics have been designed to deal with. Often the development of these socio-political institutions have formed a dialectical relationship with rights.

Rights about particular issues, or the rights of particular groups, are often areas of special concern. Often these concerns arise when rights come into conflict with other legal or moral issues, sometimes even other rights.  Issues of concern have historically included [[labor rights]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights]], [[reproductive rights]], [[disability rights]], [[patient rights]] and [[prisoners' rights]].  With increasing [[mass surveillance|monitoring]] and the information society, [[digital rights|information rights]], such as the [[right to privacy]] are becoming more important.

Some examples of groups whose rights are of particular concern include [[animal rights|animals]],&lt;ref name=tws21decghnnb&gt;{{cite news

Accordingly, politics plays an important role in developing or recognizing the above rights, and the discussion about which behaviors are included as "rights" is an ongoing political topic of importance. The concept of rights varies with political orientation. Positive rights such as a "right to medical care" are emphasized more often by left-leaning thinkers, while right-leaning thinkers place more emphasis on negative rights such as the "right to a fair trial".

Further, the term ''equality'' which is often bound up with the meaning of "rights" often depends on one's political orientation. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and advocates of [[free markets]] often identify equality with [[equality of opportunity]], and want equal and fair rules in the process of making things, while agreeing that sometimes these fair rules lead to unequal outcomes. In contrast, [[socialism|socialists]] often identify equality with [[equality of outcome]] and see fairness when people have equal amounts of goods and services, and therefore think that people have a right to equal portions of necessities such as [[health care]] or [[Welfare|economic assistance]] or [[House|housing]].&lt;ref name=tws21dece563e&gt;{{cite news

Equality of outcome fails to hold individuals responsible for imprudent actions that may, absent redress, reduce the values of the outcomes they enjoy, or for wise actions that would raise the value of the outcomes above the levels of others’. Equality of opportunity, in contrast, ‘levels the playing field,’ so that all have the potential to achieve the same outcomes; whether or not, in the event, they do, depends upon individual choice.

==Philosophy==
In [[philosophy]], [[meta-ethics]] is the branch of ethics that seeks to understand the nature of ethical [[property (philosophy)|properties]], statements, attitudes, and judgments. Meta-ethics is one of the three branches of ethics generally recognized by philosophers, the others being [[normative ethics]] and [[applied ethics]].

While normative ethics addresses such questions as "What should one do?", thus endorsing some ethical evaluations and rejecting others, meta-ethics addresses questions such as "What ''is'' goodness?" and "How can we tell what is good from what is bad?", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations.

Rights ethics is an answer to the meta-ethical question of ''what normative ethics is concerned with'' (Meta-ethics also includes a group of questions about how ethics comes to be known, true, etc. which is not directly addressed by rights ethics).
Rights ethics holds that normative ethics is concerned with rights. Alternative meta-ethical theories are that ethics is concerned with one of the following:
* Duties ([[deontology]])
* [[Value (ethics)|Value]] ([[axiology]])
* Virtue ([[virtue ethics]])
* Consequences ([[consequentialism]], e.g. [[utilitarianism]])

Rights ethics has had considerable influence on political and social thinking. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] gives some concrete examples of widely accepted rights.

===Criticism===
Some philosophers have criticised rights as [[ontologically]] dubious entities.  For instance, although in favour of the extension of [[individual rights|individual legal rights]], the [[utilitarian]] philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]] opposed the idea of [[natural law]] and [[natural rights]], calling them "nonsense upon stilts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harrison |first=Ross |chapterurl=http://www.utilitarian.net/bentham/about/1995----.htm |chapter=Jeremy Bentham |editor-last=Honderich |editor-first=Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |pages=85–88 }} Also see {{cite web |last=Sweet |first=William |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/b/bentham.htm |title=Jeremy Bentham |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=11 April 2001 |accessdate=7 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, one can question the ability of rights to actually bring about justice for all.

==Etymology==
[[File:Beowulf - rihte.jpg|thumb|"rihte," an Old English word for 'right']]
The [[Modern English]] word ''right'' derives from [[Old English]] ''riht'' or ''reht'', in turn from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*riχtaz'' meaning "right" or "direct", and ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*reg-to-'' meaning "having moved in a straight line", in turn from ''*(o)reg'(a)-'' meaning "to straighten or direct".&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:right]]&lt;/ref&gt; In several different [[Indo-European languages]], a single word derived from the same root means both "right" and "law", such as French ''droit'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:droit]]&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish ''derecho'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:derecho]]&lt;/ref&gt; German ''Recht'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:recht]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Italian ''diritto''.

Many other words related to normative or regulatory concepts derive from this same root, including ''correct'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:correct]]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''regulate'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:regulate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''rex''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rex#latin]]&lt;/ref&gt; (meaning "king"), whence ''regal''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:regal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and thence ''royal''.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:royal]]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise many more geometric terms derive from this same root, such as ''erect'' (as in "upright"),&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:erect]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''rectangle'' (literally "[[right angle]]"),&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rectangle]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''straight''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:straight]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''stretch''.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:stretch]]&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''right'', the English words ''rule''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rule]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ruler'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ruler]]&lt;/ref&gt; deriving still from the same root, have both normative or regulatory and geometric meanings (e.g. a ruler as in a king, or a ruler as in a straightedge).

Several other roots have similar normative and geometric descendants, such as Latin ''norma'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:norma#latin]]&lt;/ref&gt; whence ''[[norm (philosophy)|norm]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:norm]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''normal'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:normal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''normative''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:normative]]&lt;/ref&gt; itself, and also geometric concepts such as ''[[Normal (geometry)|normal vectors]]''; and likewise Greek ''ortho''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ortho]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin ''ordo'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ordo]]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning either "right" or "correct" (as in ''orthodox'', meaning "correct opinion"&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:orthodox]]&lt;/ref&gt;) or "straight" or "perpendicular" (as in ''orthogonal'', meaning "perpendicular angle"&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:orthogonal]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and thence ''order'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:order]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''ordinary'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ordinary]]&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

==History==

[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Magna Carta]]'' or "Great Charter" was one of England's first documents containing commitments by a [[monarch|king]] to his people to respect certain [[law|legal]] rights. It reduced the power of the monarch.]]

[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a painting; the painting is of a written declaration; there are two human images to the left and right; it says "Declaration des droits de l'homme" (declaration of the rights of man)|The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in 1789 in [[France]].]]

The specific enumeration of rights has differed greatly in different periods of history. In many cases, the system of rights promulgated by one group has come into sharp and bitter conflict with that of other groups. In the political sphere, a place in which rights have historically been an important issue, constitutional provisions of various states sometimes address the question of who has what legal rights.

Historically, many notions of rights were [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], with different people granted different rights, and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to respected from his son did not indicate a right from the son to receive a return from that respect; and the [[divine right of kings]], which permitted absolute power over subjects, did not leave a lot of room for many rights for the subjects themselves.&lt;ref name=tws21decfrre&gt;{{cite news

In contrast, modern conceptions of rights have often emphasized [[liberty]] and [[egalitarianism|equality]] as among the most important aspects of rights, as was evident in the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions.

[[File:Rotating Sphere.gif|thumb|Sphere rotating around one of its diameters]]

'''Rotation around a fixed axis''' or '''about a fixed axis of revolution''' or '''motion with respect to a fixed [[wiktionary:axis of rotation|axis of rotation]]''' is a special case of [[rotation]]al motion. The fixed axis hypothesis excludes the possibility of an axis changing its orientation, and cannot describe such phenomena as [[nutation|wobbling]] or [[precession]]. According to [[Euler's rotation theorem]], simultaneous rotation along a number of stationary axes at the same time is impossible. If two rotations are forced at the same time, a new axis of rotation will appear.

This article assumes that the rotation is also stable, such that no torque is required to keep it going. The [[kinematics]] and [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of rotation around a fixed axis of a rigid body are mathematically much simpler than those for [[Rigid body dynamics#Rigid-body angular momentum|free rotation of a rigid body]]; they are entirely analogous to those of [[linear motion]] along a single fixed direction, which is not true for ''free rotation of a rigid body''.  The expressions for the [[kinetic energy]] of the object, and for the forces on the parts of the object, are also simpler for rotation around a fixed axis, than for general rotational motion. For these reasons, rotation around a fixed axis is typically taught in introductory physics courses after students have mastered [[linear motion]]; the full generality of rotational motion is not usually taught in introductory physics classes.

==Translation and rotation==
{{see also|Rigid body}}
[[File:Worm Gear.gif|thumb|An example of rotation. Each part of the [[worm drive]]—both the worm and the worm gear—is rotating on its own axis.]]

A ''rigid body'' is an object of finite extent in which all the distances between the component particles are constant.  No truly rigid body exists; external forces can deform any solid. For our purposes, then, a rigid body is a solid which requires large forces to deform it appreciably.

A change in the position of a particle in three-dimensional space can be completely specified by three coordinates.  A change in the position of a rigid body is more complicated to describe.  It can be regarded as a combination of two distinct types of motion: translational motion and circular motion.

Purely ''[[Translation (geometry)|translational motion]]'' occurs when every particle of the body has the same instantaneous velocity as every other particle; then the path traced out by any particle is exactly parallel to the path traced out by every other particle in the body.  Under translational motion, the change in the position of a rigid body is specified completely by three coordinates such as ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' giving the [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] of any point, such as the center of mass, fixed to the rigid body.

Purely ''rotational motion'' occurs if every particle in the body moves in a circle about a single line. This line is called the axis of rotation. Then the radius [[Vector (geometry)|vector]]s from the axis to all particles undergo the same angular displacement at the same time. The axis of rotation need not go through the body. In general, any rotation can be specified completely by the three angular displacements with respect to the rectangular-coordinate axes ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''.  Any change in the position of the rigid body is thus completely described by three translational and three rotational coordinates.

Any displacement of a rigid body may be arrived at by first subjecting the body to a displacement followed by a rotation, or conversely, to a rotation followed by a displacement.  We already know that for any collection of particles—whether at rest with respect to one another, as in a rigid body, or in relative motion, like the exploding fragments of a shell, the acceleration of the center of mass is given by
:&lt;math&gt;F_{\mathrm{net}} = M a_{\mathrm{cm}}\;\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''M'' is the total mass of the system and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt; is the acceleration of the center of mass.  There remains the matter of describing the rotation of the body about the center of mass and relating it to the external forces acting on the body. The kinematics and dynamics of ''rotational motion around a single axis'' resemble the kinematics and dynamics of translational motion; rotational motion around a single axis even has a work-energy theorem analogous to that of particle dynamics.

==Kinematics==

===Angular displacement===
{{main|Angular displacement}}A particle moves in a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Having moved an arc length &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, its angular position is &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; relative to its original position, where &lt;math&gt;\theta=\frac{s}{r}&lt;/math&gt;.

In mathematics and physics it is usual to use the natural unit [[radian]]s rather than degrees or [[revolutions per minute|revolutions]]. Units are converted as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  1 \text{ revolution } &amp;= 360^\circ = 2\pi \text{ radians, and} \\
  1 \text{ rad} &amp;= \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \approx 57.27^\circ.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

An angular displacement is a change in angular position:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \theta = \theta_{2} - \theta_{1}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta \theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angular displacement, &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; is the initial angular position and &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt; is the final angular position.

===Angular speed and angular velocity===

Change in angular displacement per unit time is called angular velocity with direction along the axis of rotation. The symbol for angular velocity is &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and the units are typically rad s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Angular speed is the magnitude of angular velocity.

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\omega} = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t} = \frac{\theta_2 - \theta_1}{t_2 - t_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The instantaneous angular velocity is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(t) = \frac{d\theta}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the formula for angular position and letting &lt;math&gt;v = \frac{ds}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;, we have also

:&lt;math&gt;\omega=\frac{d\theta}{dt} =  \frac{v}{r},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the translational speed of the particle.

Angular velocity and [[frequency]] are related by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = {2 \pi f} \!&lt;/math&gt;.

===Angular acceleration===
{{main|Angular acceleration}}
A changing angular velocity indicates the presence of an angular acceleration in rigid body, typically measured in rad s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. The average angular acceleration &lt;math&gt;\overline{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; over a time interval Δ''t'' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\alpha} = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t} = \frac{\omega_2 - \omega_1}{t_2 - t_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The instantaneous acceleration ''α''(''t'') is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha(t) = \frac{d\omega}{dt} = \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the angular acceleration is the rate of change of the angular velocity, just as acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.

The translational acceleration of a point on the object rotating is given by
:&lt;math&gt;a = r\alpha,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is the radius or distance from the axis of rotation. This is also the [[tangential component]] of acceleration: it is tangential to the direction of motion of the point. If this component is 0, the motion is [[uniform circular motion]], and the velocity changes in direction only.

The radial acceleration (perpendicular to direction of motion) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;a_{\mathrm{R}} = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2r\!&lt;/math&gt;.
It is directed towards the center of the rotational motion, and is often called the ''centripetal acceleration''.

The angular acceleration is caused by the [[torque]], which can have a positive or negative value in accordance with the convention of positive and negative angular frequency. The ratio of torque and angular acceleration (how difficult it is to start, stop, or otherwise change rotation) is given by the [[moment of inertia]]: &lt;math&gt;T = I\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

===Equations of kinematics===
When the angular acceleration is constant, the five quantities angular displacement &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, initial angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega_i&lt;/math&gt;, final angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega_f&lt;/math&gt;, angular acceleration &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; can be related by four [[Kinematics#Rotational motion|equations of kinematics]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \omega_f &amp;= \omega_i + \alpha t \\
      \theta &amp;= \omega_i t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2 \\
  \omega_f^2 &amp;= \omega_i^2 + 2 \alpha\theta \\
      \theta &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left(\omega_f + \omega_i\right) t
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Dynamics==

===Moment of inertia===
{{main|Moment of inertia}}

The moment of inertia of an object, symbolized by '''I''', is a measure of the object's resistance to changes to its rotation. The moment of inertia is measured in kilogram metre² (kg m²). It depends on the object's mass: increasing the mass of an object increases the moment of inertia. It also depends on the distribution of the mass: distributing the mass further from the center of rotation increases the moment of inertia by a greater degree. For a single particle of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from the axis of rotation, the moment of inertia is given by

:&lt;math&gt;I = mr^2.&lt;/math&gt;

===Torque===
{{main|Torque}}
Torque &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; is the twisting effect of a force '''F''' applied to a rotating object which is at position '''r''' from its axis of rotation. Mathematically,
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F},&lt;/math&gt;
where × denotes the [[cross product]]. A net torque acting upon an object will produce an angular acceleration of the object according to
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = I\boldsymbol{\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;
just as '''F''' = ''m'''''a''' in linear dynamics.

The work done by a torque acting on an object equals the magnitude of the torque times the angle through which the torque is applied:
:&lt;math&gt;W = \tau\theta. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The power of a torque is equal to the work done by the torque per unit time, hence:
:&lt;math&gt;P = \tau\omega. \!&lt;/math&gt;

===Angular momentum===
{{main|Angular momentum}}
The angular  momentum &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the difficulty of bringing a rotating object to rest. It is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \sum\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; for all particles in the object.
Angular momentum is the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=I\boldsymbol{\omega},&lt;/math&gt;
just as '''p''' = ''m'''''v''' in linear dynamics.

The equivalent of linear momentum in rotational motion is angular momentum. The greater the angular momentum of the spinning object such as a top, the greater its tendency to continue to spin.

The Angular Momentum of a rotating body is proportional to its mass and to how rapidly it is turning. In addition, the angular momentum depends on how the mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation: the further away the mass is located from the axis of rotation, the greater the angular momentum. A flat disk such as a record turntable has less angular momentum than a hollow cylinder of the same mass and velocity of rotation.

Like linear momentum, angular momentum is vector quantity, and its conservation implies that the direction of the spin axis tends to remain unchanged. For this reason, the spinning top remains upright whereas a stationary one falls over immediately.

The angular momentum equation can be used to relate the moment of the resultant force on a body about an axis (sometimes called torque), and the rate of rotation about that axis.

Torque and angular momentum are related according to
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt},&lt;/math&gt;
just as '''F''' = ''d'''''p'''/''dt'' in linear dynamics. In the absence of an external torque, the angular momentum of a body remains constant. The conservation of angular momentum is notably demonstrated in [[figure skating]]: when pulling the arms closer to the body during a spin, the moment of inertia is decreased, and so the angular velocity is increased.

===Kinetic energy===
{{main|Kinetic energy}}The kinetic energy ''K''&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt; due to the rotation of the body is given by
:&lt;math&gt;K_\text{rot} = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2,&lt;/math&gt;
just as ''K''&lt;sub&gt;trans&lt;/sub&gt; = {{frac|1|2}}''mv''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in linear dynamics.

Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. The amount of translational kinetic energy found in two variables: the mass of the object (m) and the speed of the object (v) as shown in the equation above.  Kinetic energy must always be either zero or a positive value. While velocity can have either a positive or negative value, velocity squared will always be positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/work-and-energy/work-and-energy-tutorial/a/what-is-kinetic-energy|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vector expression==
{{See also|Vector (geometry)}}
The above development is a special case of general rotational motion.  In the general case, angular displacement, angular velocity, angular acceleration, and torque are considered to be vectors.

An  angular displacement is considered to be a vector, pointing along the axis, of magnitude equal to that of &lt;math&gt;\Delta \theta&lt;/math&gt;.  A [[right-hand rule]] is used to find which way it points along the axis; if the fingers of the right hand are curled to point in the way that the object has rotated, then the thumb of the right hand points in the direction of the vector.

The [[angular velocity]] vector also points along the [[axis of rotation]] in the same way as the angular displacements it causes.  If a disk spins counterclockwise as seen from above, its angular velocity vector points upwards.  Similarly, the [[angular acceleration]] vector points along the axis of rotation in the same direction that the angular velocity would point if the angular acceleration were maintained for a long time.

The torque vector points along the axis around which the torque tends to cause rotation. To maintain rotation around a fixed axis, the total torque vector has to be along the axis, so that it only changes the magnitude and not the direction of the angular velocity vector. In the case of a hinge, only the component of the torque vector along the axis has an effect on the rotation, other forces and torques are compensated by the structure.

==Examples and applications==

===Constant angular speed===
{{main|Uniform circular motion}}
The simplest case of rotation around a fixed axis is that of constant angular speed. Then the total torque is zero.  For the example of the Earth rotating around its axis, there is very little friction.  For a  [[Fan (mechanical)|fan]], the motor applies a torque to compensate for friction. Similar to the fan, equipment found in the mass production manufacturing industry demonstrate rotation around a fixed axis effectively. For example, a multi-spindle lathe is used to rotate the material on its axis to effectively increase production of cutting, deformation and turning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.davenportmachine.com/multi-spindle-machines/|title=Multi Spindle Machines - An In-Depth Overview|work=Davenport Machine|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The angle of rotation is a linear function of time, which modulo 360° is a periodic function.

An example of this is the [[two-body problem]] with [[circular orbit]]s.

===Centripetal force===
{{main|Centripetal force}}
{{See also|Fictitious force}}
Internal [[tensile stress]] provides the [[centripetal force]] that keeps a spinning object together.  A [[rigid body]] model neglects the accompanying [[Strain (materials science)|strain]].  If the body is not rigid this strain will cause it to change shape. This is expressed as the object changing shape due to the "[[centrifugal force]]".

Celestial bodies rotating about each other often have [[elliptic orbit]]s. The special case of [[circular orbit]]s is an example of a rotation around a fixed axis: this axis is the line through the [[center of mass]] perpendicular to the plane of motion. The centripetal force is provided by [[gravity]], see also [[two-body problem]]. This usually also applies for a spinning celestial body, so it need not be solid to keep together unless the angular speed is too high in relation to its density. (It will, however, tend to become [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]].)  For example, a spinning celestial body of water must take at least 3 hours and 18 minutes to rotate, regardless of size, or the water will separate{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. If the density of the fluid is higher the time can be less. See [[orbital period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WQCJOkVfsUC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=orbital+period+3+hours+18+minute&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc_bejorTVAhWRCD4KHdBEB0UQ6AEIJjAA|title=Cataclysmic Cosmic Events and How to Observe Them|last=Mobberley|first=Martin|date=2009-03-01|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780387799469|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RoySocChem 5770.jpg|thumb|right|266px|RSC London Headquarters]]
The '''Royal Society of Chemistry''' ('''RSC''') is a [[learned society]] ([[professional association]]) in the [[United Kingdom]] with the goal of "advancing the [[chemistry|chemical]] sciences". It was formed in 1980 from the amalgamation of the [[Chemical Society]], the [[Royal Institute of Chemistry]], the [[Faraday Society]], and the [[Society for Analytical Chemistry]] with a new Royal Charter and the dual role of learned society and professional body. At its inception, the Society had a combined membership of 34,000 in the UK and a further 8,000 abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/History/ABriefHistory.asp |title=RSC History |publisher=Rsc.org |date= 2014-04-02|accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters of the Society are at [[Burlington House]], [[Piccadilly]], [[London]].  It also has offices in Thomas Graham House in [[Cambridge]] (named after [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]], the first president of the [[Chemical Society]]) where ''RSC Publishing'' is based. The Society has offices in the [[United States]] at the [[University City Science Center]], [[Philadelphia]], in both [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Bangalore]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/AboutUs/contacts/ |title=RSC Contacts |publisher=Rsc.org |date= 2014-04-16|accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The organisation carries out research, publishes [[academic journal|journals]], books and databases, as well as hosting conferences, seminars and workshops.  It is the professional body for chemistry in the UK, with the ability to award the status of [[Chartered Chemist]] (CChem) and, through the Science Council the awards of Chartered Scientist (CSci), Registered Scientist (RSci) and Registered Science Technician (RScTech) to suitably qualified candidates.  The designation FRSC is given to a group of elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry|Fellows of the society]] who have made major contributions to chemistry and other interface disciplines such as biological chemistry.  The names of Fellows are published each year in ''[[The Times]]'' (London). [[Honorary Fellows of the Royal Society of Chemistry|Honorary Fellowship of the Society]] ("HonFRSC") is awarded for distinguished service in the field of chemistry.

== President ==

The president is elected biennially and wears a badge in the form of a spoked wheel, with the standing figure of Joseph Priestley depicted in enamel, mainly in red and blue, on a hexagonal medallion in the centre. The rim of the wheel is gold, and the twelve spokes are of non-tarnishable metals.

The current president is Sir [[John Holman (chemist)|John Holman]] (2016–2018).&lt;ref name="RSC2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/news-events/rsc-news/articles/2015/jun/election-results-2015/|title=2015 RSC Elections|website=Rsc.org|date=15 June 2015|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GRSC ===
The qualification ''GRSC'' (Graduate of the Royal Society of Chemistry) was awarded from 1981 to 1995 for completion of college courses equivalent to an honours chemistry degree and overseen by the RSC.&lt;ref name=GRSC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/images/GraduateQualificationsChemistry_tcm18-94249.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619185400/http://rsc.org/images/GraduateQualificationsChemistry_tcm18-94249.pdf |archivedate=19 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It replaced the GRIC offered by the Royal Institute of Chemistry.

== Divisions ==
The society is organised around 9 divisions, based on subject areas, and local sections, both in the United Kingdom and overseas.  Divisions cover broad areas of chemistry but also contain many special interest groups for more specific areas.

* ''Analytical Division'' for [[analytical chemistry]] and promoting the original aims of the ''Society for Analytical Chemistry''. 12 Subject Groups.
* ''Dalton Division'', named after [[John Dalton]], for [[inorganic chemistry]]. 6 Subject Groups.
* ''Education Division'' for [[Chemistry education|chemical education]]. 4 Subject Groups.
* ''Faraday Division'', named after [[Michael Faraday]], for [[physical chemistry]] and promoting the original aims of the ''Faraday Society''. 14 Subject Groups.
* ''Organic Division'' for [[organic chemistry]]. 6 Subject Groups.
* ''Chemical Biology Interface Division''. 2 Subject Groups.
* ''Environment, Sustainability and Energy Division''. 3 Subject Groups.
* ''Materials Chemistry Division''. 4 Subject Groups.
* ''Industry and Technology Division''. 13 Subject Groups.

There are 12 subjects groups not attached to a division.

== Local sections ==
There are 35 local sections covering the United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and many other countries there are Local Representatives of the society and often some activities.

== Publications ==

[[File:Thomas Graham House - 2014-10-09 - Andy Mabbett - 03.JPG|thumb|Thomas Graham House – from where the Society's publishing arm operates – in 2014]]

The society is a [[not for profit|not-for-profit]] publisher: surplus made by its publishing business is invested to support its aim of advancing the chemical sciences.

In addition to [[scientific journals]], including its flagship journals ''[[Chemical Communications]]'', [[Chemical Science (journal)|''Chemical Science'']] and ''[[Chemical Society Reviews]]'', the society publishes:

* ''[[Education in Chemistry]]'' for teachers.
* A free online journal for chemistry educators, ''[[Chemistry Education Research and Practice]]''.
* A general chemistry magazine ''[[Chemistry World]]'',  sent monthly to all members of the Society throughout the world. The editorial board consists of 10 academic and industrial chemists. It was first published in January 2004. It replaced ''Chemistry in Britain'', first published in 1965. Its contents include news, articles of a general chemical nature, such as the history of chemistry and technological developments, book reviews and letters from readers. Its ISSN is 1473-7604. ''[[Chemistry World]]'' is supported by the ''Chemistry World Podcast'', which is presented by Cambridge University scientist [[Chris Smith (doctor)|Dr Chris Smith]], who also edits ''[[The Naked Scientists]]''.
* Professional reference books across the chemical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/Shop/books/series/index.asp |title=Series |website=Rsc.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Books for students, including the ''Tutorial Chemistry Texts'' series of 23 books, edited by E. W. Abel, and the 8 books in the ''Molecular World'' series, whose coordinating editor is L. E. Smart.
* Books on the history of chemistry, such as a history of the [[Faraday Society]].

Subscriptions to the journals are available individually, or "all-in", under a provision called "RSC Gold".&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/librarians/RSC_Gold.asp|title=RSC Gold|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=18 December 2014|date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[London]] offices of the Society are in [[Burlington House]], Piccadilly. Events are hosted here for the public, RSC member groups and external organisations including monthly lectures on the chemical sciences that streamed live via the RSC's public engagement website – the Reaction. The free lectures take an interesting look at the chemical aspects of a wide range of topics from curry to the enjoyment of music.

The events have attracted notable science writers such as [[Philip Ball]], [[Antony John Williams]], and [[John Emsley]] to give public lectures. Most of these are available as archived video streams via the RSC's Reaction website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thereaction.net/events/ |title=Reaction articles |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324234320/http://thereaction.net/events/ |archivedate=24 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
Although opened as the Chemistry Centre in 2010, the building has been occupied by the Royal Society of Chemistry since 1857 (at which time it was known as the Chemical Society) – the heart of the Chemistry Centre is the RSC's Library and Information Centre which itself dates back to 1842. Over the years, the library for the RSC has received many gifts from notable fellows including [[Michael Faraday]]. The library became a centre for information on the chemical sciences during the 1st and 2nd world wars when extensive use was made on the chemical reference material available. In November 2014, the society announced that the centre would be rebranded as simply "Royal Society of Chemistry at Burlington House" and the name "Chemistry Centre" dropped.

== Library and information centre ==
The society has a large library covering mainly chemistry-based subjects, including online access for members, housed at the Chemistry Centre at Burlington House. It is part of the Chemistry Centre and is a resource for RSC members, although the public are also welcome.

==Benevolent fund==
[[File:RSC Staircase.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The staircase at the Royal Society of Chemistry, Burlington House, designed by the partnership of Robert Richardson Banks and Charles Barry, Jr.]]
The Chemists' Community Fund, the working name of the Royal Society of Chemistry's Benevolent Fund, supports the members and their families during difficult times, through advice and guidance, financial and volunteer support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/awards-funding/funding/benevolent-fund/ |title=Chemists' Community Fund - formerly the Benevolent Fund - Royal Society of Chemistry |website=Rsc.org |date= 2016-04-27|accessdate=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It dates back to 1920 when the Institute of Chemistry (later the [[Royal Institute of Chemistry]]) established it as a memorial to its members who died in the First World War. It had an aim "to help necessitous persons who are, or have been, Fellows or Associates of the Institute, their wives or children, and the widows and dependent relatives of deceased Fellows and Associates" through voluntary contributions from members. The Fund's ethos of "members helping members" stems from the Institute of Chemistry's Council raising money for members in need from other members prior to the fund being formed.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Benevolent Fund|url=http://www.rsc.org/Membership/Benefits/BenFund/aboutus/history.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123081459/http://www.rsc.org/Membership/Benefits/BenFund/aboutus/history.asp|archivedate=2008|date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the benevolent fund introduced a volunteer visitor system, where members were asked to visit applicants, beneficiaries, elderly and housebound members in their area. Each local section was also appointed a fund representative.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A major review of the fund to modernize it took place in 2003–2004, forming a new strategy document that is updated every three years. It underwent another review in 2014 with the aim to widen its reach to include the prevention of poverty and provide a more holistic support wider than financial assistance to Royal Society of Chemistry members and their families.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The Benevolent Fund Grants Committee, formed of volunteer members of the Royal Society of Chemistry, oversees the fund and meets every three months.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Prizes and awards ==
{{Main|List of Royal Society of Chemistry medals and awards}}

The RSC awards a variety of prizes and awards each year that include awards for excellence in any area of chemistry, in specialist areas or for achievement at particular stages of a chemist's career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Awards/ |title=RSC prizes and awards |publisher=Rsc.org |date= 2014-04-02|accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medals are awarded centrally by the RSC and by the divisions of the organisation. There are also awards that are administered by RSC interest groups.

The centrally awarded medals include the [[Harrison-Meldola Memorial Prizes]] which are awarded to a British chemist who is under 32 years of age for promising original investigations in chemistry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Awards/HarrisonMeldolaMemorialPrizes/Index.asp |title=Harrison-Meldola Memorial Prize |publisher=Rsc.org |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Corday-Morgan medal]]s which consist of three separate awards made for the most meritorious contributions to experimental chemistry (including computer simulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Awards/CordayMorganPrizes/Index.asp |title=Corday-Morgan Prizes |publisher=Rsc.org |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tilden Prize]], previously known as the Tilden Lecture, consists of three awards annually to scientists in mid-career for advances in chemistry.

Previous winners of the Harrison-Meldola Prize (known as the [[Meldola Medal and Prize]] prior to its merger in 2008 with the Edward Harrison prize) include [[Christopher Kelk Ingold]] (1921, 1922), [[Cyril Norman Hinshelwood]] (1923), R.H. Stokes (1946), D.H. Williams (1966), and J. Evans (1978).

Corday-Morgan medal recipients include [[Derek Harold Richard Barton|Derek Barton]] (1949), [[Ronald Sydney Nyholm]] (1950), [[Frederick Sanger]] (1951), [[John Cornforth]] (1953), [[Rex Richards (scientist)|Rex Richards]] (1954), and [[George Porter]] (1955).

The Faraday Division annually awards the [[Marlow Award]] for contributions to [[physical chemistry]] or [[chemical physics]] by members of the Faraday Division under the age of 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Awards/MarlowAward/Index.asp |title=Marlow Award |publisher=Rsc.org |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent recipients include [[Andrew Orr-Ewing]], (1999), [[Jonathan A.

==Coat of arms==
The RSC has its own [[coat of arms]]. Two forms exist: the full coat of arms has lion and unicorn bearers, and the [[Latin]] motto "''{{lang|la|Pro scientia et humanitate}}''" (For the sake of knowledge and for the benefit of mankind). The smaller version uses just the central shield, which is similar to that in the [[Royal Institute of Chemistry]]'s arms.

In [[mycology]], a '''sanctioned name''' is a [[scientific name|name]] that was adopted (but not necessarily coined) in certain works of [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] or [[Elias Magnus Fries]], which are considered major points in [[fungal]] taxonomy.

==Definition and effects==
Sanctioned names are those, regardless of their authorship, that were used by Persoon in his ''[[Synopsis Methodica Fungorum]]'' (1801) for [[rust (fungus)|rusts]], [[smut (fungus)|smuts]] and [[gasteromycetes]], and in Fries's ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]'' (three volumes, published 1821–32) and ''[[Elenchus fungorum]]'' for all other fungi.&lt;ref name=Korf1983/&gt;

A sanctioned name, as defined under article 15 of the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (previously, the ''International Code of Botanical Nomenclature'') is automatically treated as if conserved against all earlier [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]s or [[Homonym (biology)|homonym]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G. Gantner Verlag KG  |isbn=978-3-87429-425-6 |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=title }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can still, however, be [[Conserved name|conserved or rejected]] normally.

==History==
Because of the imprecision associated with assigning starting dates for fungi sanctioned in Fries' three ''Systema'' volumes, the [[Stockholm]] 1950 [[International Botanical Congress]] defined arbitrary or actual publication dates for the starting points to improve the stability of nomenclature. These dates were 1 May 1753 for ''Species Plantarum'' (vascular plants), 31 December 1801 for ''Synopsis Methodica Fungorum'', 31 December 1820 for ''Flora der Vorweldt'' (fossil plants), and 1 Jan 1821 for the first volume of ''Systema''. Because fungi defined in the second and third volumes lacked a starting-point book for reference, the Congress declared that these species, in addition to species defined in Fries' 1828 ''Elenchus Fungorum'' (a two-volume supplement to his ''System''), had "privileged status". According to Korf,&lt;ref name=Korf1983/&gt; the term "sanctioned" was first used to indicate these privileged names by the Dutch mycologist [[Marinus Anton Donk]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=Donk1961/&gt;

In 1982, changes in the ''International Code for Botanical Nomenclature'' (the Sydney Code) restored Linnaeus' 1753 ''Species Plantarum'' as the starting point for fungal nomenclature; however, protected status was given to all names adopted by Persoon in his 1801 ''Synopsis'', and by Fries in both the ''Systema'' and the ''Elenchus''.&lt;ref name=Korf1983/&gt;&lt;ref name=Demoulin1981/&gt; Soon after, in 1983, [[Richard P. Korf]] proposed the now widely accepted "colon-author indication", whereby sanctioned names are indicated by including ": Pers." or ": Fr." when fully citing the species author.&lt;ref name=Kuyper1998/&gt;
&lt;!--There are explanation in Hawksworth, I believe, about how the harsher starting date rule made validation of pre-Persoon/Fries name that they did not cover a conundrum, hence the restoration of the Linnean starting date and creation of the sanctioned status.--&gt;

'''Secular Buddhism'''—sometimes also referred to as '''agnostic Buddhism''', '''Buddhist agnosticism''', '''ignostic Buddhism''', '''atheistic Buddhism''', '''pragmatic Buddhism''', '''Buddhist atheism''', or '''Buddhist secularism'''—is a broad term for an emerging form of [[Buddhism]] and [[secular spirituality]] that is based on [[humanism|humanist]], [[skeptical]], and/or [[agnostic]] values, as well as [[pragmatism]] and (often) [[Spiritual naturalism|naturalism]], rather than religious (or more specifically [[supernatural]] or [[paranormal]]) beliefs.

Secular Buddhists interpret the teachings of the [[Buddha]] and the [[Buddhist texts]] in a [[rationalist]] and often [[evidentialism|evidentialist]] manner, considering the historical and cultural contexts of the times in which the Buddha lived and the various [[List of suttas|sutta]]s, [[sutra]]s and [[tantra]]s were written.

Within the framework of secular Buddhism, Buddhist doctrine may be stripped of any unspecified combination of various traditional beliefs that could be considered [[superstitious]], or that cannot be tested through [[empirical research]], namely: supernatural beings (such as [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s, [[bodhisattvas]], [[nāga]]s, [[preta]]s, [[List of Buddhas|Buddha]]s, etc.), [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] and its [[Pariṇāmanā|transference]], [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]], [[Buddhist cosmology]] (including the existence of [[pure land]]s and [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hells]]), etc.

Traditional Buddhist ethics, such as conservative views regarding [[Buddhism and abortion|abortion]], and [[Buddhism and sexuality|human sexuality]], may or may not be called into question as well. Some schools, especially [[Western Buddhism|Western Buddhist]] ones, take more progressive stances regarding social issues.

== History ==

The appearance of secular Buddhism is understood as part of the broad trend of secularization that has been developing in the West since the recovery of [[classical Greek culture]] in the Renaissance, rather than merely as a consequence of the supposed triumph of scientific rationalism over religion in the modern period. Moreover, many aspects of secular Buddhism have been prompted by organizational developments that began in a minority of lay Buddhist practice communities (''sanghas'') in the West during the last decades of the 20th century, when the hierarchical features of Buddhist monastic culture were abandoned in favor of democratic principles of civic association. In particular, the need to include women on an equal footing produced organizational innovations, which disrupted older patterns of patriarchal authority and gender exclusivity.&lt;ref name="Higgins" /&gt;

In the 21st century, the new information and communication technologies have provided a seedbed for secular Buddhism by making teachings and discussion more freely available and readily accessible, thus facilitating the formation of virtual and actual practice communities. Today there are websites explicitly dedicated to secular Buddhism in Australia, Austria, Canada, New Zealand, Spain, the UK and the USA.

Secular Buddhism has its roots in [[Buddhist modernism]] and [[secular humanism]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} The [[Vipassana movement|Insight meditation movement]] in the United States was founded on modernist secular values. [[Jack Kornfield]], an American teacher and former [[Theravada|Theravadin]] monk, stated that the [[Insight Meditation Society]] wanted to present Buddhist meditation “without the complications of rituals, robes, chanting and the whole religious tradition.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fronsdal|first1=Gil|title=Insight Meditation in the United States: Life , Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness|url=http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/articles/InsightinUS.pdf|website=http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SN Goenka|S. N. Goenka]], a popular teacher of Buddhist Vipassana meditation, taught that his practice was not a sectarian doctrine, but “something from which people of every background can benefit: an art of living.”&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Erik.  S. N. Goenka, Pioneer of Secular Meditation Movement, Dies at 90, http://tricycle.org/trikedaily/s-n-goenka-pioneer-secular-meditation-movement-dies-90/&lt;/ref&gt; This essentially treats Buddhism as an applied [[philosophy]], rather than a [[religion]],{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} or relies on [[Buddhist philosophy]] without dogmatism.

[[Stephen Batchelor (author)|Stephen Batchelor]] is a self-proclaimed Secular Buddhist who promotes a strictly secular form of Buddhism. Batchelor was a Buddhist monk ordained in the more traditional forms of Buddhism. From his experience as a monk practicing [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and later [[Zen]], he felt the need for a more secular and agnostic approach. In his books ''Buddhism Without Beliefs'' and ''Confession of a Buddhist Atheist'' he articulates his approach to the Buddha's teaching, describes [[Buddha|Siddhattha]] Gautama as a historic person rather than an idealized religious icon, and scrutinizes typical Buddhist doctrines dealing with the concept of an [[afterlife]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] peer [[Eric Lubbock, 4th Baron Avebury|Lord Avebury]] was a secular Buddhist and a [[secular humanism|humanist]] and a patron of the [[British Humanist Association]] until his death. He was instrumental in securing the abolition of [[blasphemy]] as a crime in England and Wales.

== Key concepts and practices ==
Secular Buddhism is a newly emerging, predominantly lay movement within Buddhism. Unlike the various kinds of Buddhist modernism, which tend to be modifications of traditional schools of Buddhist thought and practice in the light of the discourses of modernity, secular Buddhism is founded on a reconfiguration of core elements of the dharma itself.&lt;ref name="Batchelor" /&gt; To this end it seeks to recover the original teachings of Siddhattha Gotama, the historical Buddha, yet without claiming to disclose "what the Buddha really meant". Rather, it interprets the early canonical teachings in a way that draws out their meaning in the Buddha's own historical context (the culture of the Gangetic plains in the fifth century BCE) while demonstrating their value and relevance to people living in our own time. Both aspects of this interpretation are literally "secular" in that they evoke the Latin root word ''saeculum'' – a particular age or generation. The ethos of the movement is perhaps best captured in Stephen Batchelor's ''Confession of a Buddhist Atheist''.&lt;ref name="Batchelor2" /&gt;

Secular Buddhism proposes that we leave behind the metaphysical beliefs and [[soteriology]] of Indian religious culture. This culture saw human life as an irredeemable realm of suffering, from which one should seek transcendence in an enduring beyond-human condition – a stance that virtually all Buddhist schools, as well as Hinduism and Jainism, perpetuate. Secular Buddhism, on the other hand, seeks to deploy the Buddha's teaching as a guide to full human flourishing in this life and this world. In adopting this post-metaphysical{{clarify|date=January 2018}} position, it parts company with existing religious forms of Buddhist orthodoxy, which have evolved since the Buddha's death. Instead, it aligns itself with today's post-metaphysical philosophy, not least phenomenology, so finding itself on a convergent path with similar movements in radical Christian theology, as exemplified by the work of thinkers such as [[Don Cupitt]] and [[Gianni Vattimo]].&lt;ref name="Cupitt" /&gt;

Secular Buddhism likewise rejects the authoritarian structures of power legitimated by the metaphysics of orthodox Buddhist belief. It questions notions of spiritual progress based on standardized prescriptions for meditation practice, as well as the widespread idea that Buddhist practice is essentially concerned with gaining proficiency in a set of meditative techniques endorsed by the authority of a traditional school or teacher.&lt;ref name="Magid" /&gt;  Instead, secular Buddhism emphasizes a praxis that encourages autonomy and encompasses equally every aspect of one's humanity, as modeled by the [[Noble Eightfold Path|noble eight-fold path]] (right vision, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness and concentration). Such an approach is open to generating a wide range of responses to specific individual and communal needs, rather than insisting on there being "one true way" to "enlightenment" valid for all times and places.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2476">In [[pharmaceutics]], sink condition is a term mostly related to the [[dissolution testing]] procedure.

It means using a sheer volume of [[solvent]], usually about 5 to 10 times greater than the volume present in the [[saturated solution]] of the targeted chemical (often the [[Active pharmaceutical ingredient|API]], and sometimes the [[excipients]]) contained in the [[dosage form]] being tested.&lt;ref name="Shear Rate &amp; Sink Conditions LabHut"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shear Rate &amp; Sink Conditions|url=http://www.labhut.com/education-centre/about-dissolution-testing/shear-rate-sink-conditions.html|website=LabHut|publisher=SMI-LabHut Ltd|accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[dissolution testing]], "sink condition" is a mandatory requirement, otherwise when the concentration begins to get too close to the [[saturation point (chemistry)|saturation point]], even though the [[solubility|total soluble amount]] still remains constant, the [[Rate of solution|dissolution rate]] will gradually begin to reduce in significant amounts, enough to corrupt the [[test method|test]] results. .&lt;ref name="Liu2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ron Liu|title=Water-Insoluble Drug Formulation, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cfzT2ZY8hUC&amp;pg=PA73|date=18 January 2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-0955-2|pages=73–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GhoshJasti2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tapash K.

'''Social neuroscience''' is an interdisciplinary field devoted to understanding how [[biological system]]s implement social processes and [[behavior]], and to using biological concepts and methods to inform and refine theories of social processes and behavior. [[Humans]] are fundamentally a social species, rather than individualists. As such, ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' create [[emergent organization]]s beyond the individual—structures that range from dyads, families, and groups to cities, civilizations, and cultures. These emergent structures evolved hand in hand with [[neural]] and [[hormonal]] mechanisms to support them because the consequent social behaviors helped these organisms survive, reproduce, and care for offspring sufficiently long that they too survived to reproduce. The term "social neuroscience" can be traced to a publication entitled "Social Neuroscience Bulletin" that was published quarterly between 1988 and 1994.  The term was subsequently popularized in an article by [[John Cacioppo]] and [[Gary Berntson]], published in [[the American Psychologist]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cacioppo J. T. |author2=Berntson G. G. | year = 1992 | title = Social psychological contributions to the decade of the brain: Doctrine of multilevel analysis | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 1019–1028 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.47.8.1019 | pmid=1510329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cacioppo and Berntson are considered as the legitimate fathers of social neuroscience. Still a young field, social [[neuroscience]] is closely related to [[affective neuroscience]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]], focusing on how the [[brain]] mediates [[social interaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cacioppo J. T. |author2=Berntson G. G. |author3=Decety J. | year = 2010 | title = Social neuroscience and its relation to social psychology | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 675–684 | doi=10.1521/soco.2010.28.6.675|pmc=3883133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological underpinnings of [[social cognition]] are investigated in [[social cognitive neuroscience]]

==Overview==
Traditional [[neuroscience]] has for many years considered the [[nervous system]] as an isolated entity and largely ignored influences of the social environments in which humans and many animal species live. In fact, we now recognize the considerable impact of social structures on the operations of the brain and body. These social factors operate on the individual through a continuous interplay of neural, [[neuroendocrine]], [[metabolic]] and [[Immune system|immune]] factors on brain and body, in which the brain is the central regulatory organ and also a malleable target of these factors.&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J. T., Berntson, G. G., &amp; Decety, J. (2011). A history of social neuroscience. In A. W. Kruglanski and [[Wolfgang Stroebe|W. Stroebe]] (Eds.), Handbook of the History of Social Psychology. New York: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Social neuroscience investigates the [[mechanism (biology)|biological mechanisms]] that underlie social processes and behavior, widely considered one of the major problem areas for the [[neuroscience]]s in the 21st century, and applies concepts and methods of [[biology]] to develop [[scientific theories|theories]] of social processes and behavior in the social and [[behavioral sciences]]. Social neuroscience capitalizes on biological concepts and methods to inform and refine theories of social behavior, and it uses social and behavioral constructs and data to advance theories of neural organization and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cacioppo J.T.| year = 2007 | title = Social neuroscience: progress and implications for mental health | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 99–123 |display-authors=etal | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00032.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cacioppo J. T. |author2=Decety J. | year = 2011 | title = Social neuroscience: challenges and opportunities in the study of complex behavior | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1224| issue = | pages = 162–173| doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05858.x | pmid=21251011 | pmc=3098127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout most of the 20th century, social and biological explanations were widely viewed as incompatible. But advances in recent years have led to the development of a new approach synthesized from the social and biological sciences. The new field of social neuroscience emphasizes the complementary relationship between the different levels of organization, spanning the social and biological domains (e.g., [[Molecular biology|molecular]], [[Cellular biology|cellular]], [[Systems biology|system]], person, relational, collective, societal) and the use of multi-level analyses to foster understanding of the mechanisms underlying the human mind and behavior.

==Methods==
A number of methods are used in social neuroscience to investigate the confluence of [[nervous system|neural]] and social processes. These methods draw from behavioral techniques developed in [[social psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[neuropsychology]], and are associated with a variety of neurobiological techniques including [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), [[facial electromyography]] (EMG), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[event-related potential]]s (ERPs), [[electrocardiogram]]s, [[electromyogram]]s, [[endocrinology]], [[immunology]], [[galvanic skin response]] (GSR), single-cell recording, and studies of [[Ataxia#Focal lesions|focal brain lesion]] patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adolphs R | year = 2003 | title = Investigating the cognitive neuroscience of social behavior | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 119–126 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(02)00142-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cacioppo, J.T., &amp; Berntson, G.G. (2009), Handbook of Neuroscience for the Behavioral Science. New York: John Wiley and Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harmon-Jones, E., &amp; Beer, J.S. (2009). Methods in Social Neuroscience. New York: The Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward, J. (2012). The Student's Guide to Social Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Subbaraju et al"&gt;{{vcite journal |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|year=2017 |title= Identification of lateralized compensatory neural activities within the social brain due to autism spectrum disorder in adolescent males |author= Subbaraju V, Sundaram S, Narasimhan S |doi=10.1111/ejn.13634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal models are also important to investigate the putative role of specific brain structures, circuits, or processes (e.g., the [[reward system]] and [[drug addiction]]). In addition, quantitative meta-analyses are important to move beyond idiosyncrasies of individual studies, and neurodevelopmental investigations can contribute to our understanding of brain-behavior associations.&lt;ref&gt;de Haan, M., &amp; Gunnar, M.R. (2009). Handbook of Developmental Social Neuroscience. The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Cacioppo T.T. | year = 2010 | title = Frontiers in human neuroscience, the golden triangle, and beyond | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 5 | issue = 6| pages = 767–771 | doi=10.1177/1745691610388780| pmc=3904345}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most popular forms of methods used in social neuroscience are fMRI and EEG. fMRI are very cost efficient and high in spatial resolution. However, they are low in temporal resolution and therefore, are best to discover pathways in the brain that are used during social experiments. fMRI have low temporal resolution (timing) because they read oxygenated blood levels that pool to the parts of the brain that are activated and need more oxygen. Thus, the blood takes time to travel to the part of the brain being activated and in reverse provides a lower ability to test for exact timing of activation during social experiments. EEG is best used when a researcher is trying to brain map a certain area that correlates to a [[social construct]] that is being studied. EEGs provide high temporal resolution but low spatial resolution. In which, the timing of the activation is very accurate but it is hard to pinpoint exact areas on the brain, researchers are to narrow down locations and areas but they also create a lot of "noise". Most recently, researchers have been using TMS which is the best way to discover the exact location in the process of brain mapping. This machine can turn on and off parts of the brain which then allows researchers to test what that part of the brain is used for during social events. However, this machine is so expensive that it is rarely used.

Note: Most of these methods can only provide correlations between brain mapping and social events (apart from TMS), a con of Social Neuroscience is that the research must be interpreted through correlations which can cause a decreased content validity. For example, during an experiment when a participant is doing a task to test for a social theory and a part of the brain is activated, it is impossible to form causality because anything else in the room or the thoughts of the person could have triggered that response. It is very hard to isolate these variables during these experiments. That is why self-reports are very important. This will also help decrease the chances of VooDoo correlations (correlations that are too high and over 0.8 which look like a correlation exists between two factors but actually is just an error in design and statistical measures). Another way to avoid this con, is to use tests with hormones which can infer causality. For example, when people are given oxytocin and placebos and we can test their differences in social behavior between other people. Using SCRs will also help isolate unconscious thoughts and conscious thoughts because it is the body's natural parasympathetic response to the outside world. All of these tests and devices will help social neuroscientists discover the connections in the brain that are used to carry out our everyday social activities.

Primarily [[psychology|psychological]] methods include performance-based measures that record response time and/or accuracy,&lt;ref&gt;Ward, J. (2012). The Student's Guide to Social Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Implicit Association Test]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Greenwald A. G. |author2=McGhee D. E. |author3=Schwartz J. L. K. | year = 1998 | title = Measuring individual differences in implicit cognition: The Implicit Association Test | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 1464–1480 | doi =  10.1037/0022-3514.74.6.1464}}&lt;/ref&gt; observational measures such as preferential looking in infant studies; and, self-report measures, such as questionnaire and interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, J. (2012). The Student's Guide to Social Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurobiological methods can be grouped together into ones that measure more external bodily responses, electrophysiological methods, hemodynamic measures, and lesion methods. 
Bodily response methods include GSR (also known as skin conductance response (SCR)), facial EMG, and the eyeblink startle response. Electrophysiological methods include single-cell recordings, EEG, and ERPs. Hemodynamic measures, which, instead of directly measuring neural activity, measure changes in blood flow, include PET and fMRI. Lesion methods traditionally study brains that have been damaged via natural causes, such as strokes, traumatic injuries, tumors, neurosurgery, infection, or neurodegenerative disorders. In its ability to create a type of 'virtual lesion' that is temporary, TMS may also be included in this category. More specifically, TMS methods involve stimulating one area of the brain to isolate it from the rest of the brain, imitating a brain lesion. This is particularly helpful in brain mapping, a key approach in social neuroscience designed to determine which areas of the brain are activated during certain activities.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, J. (2012). The Student's Guide to Social Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[animal testing on rodents|rodent studies]] of gene expression predominately measure the consequences of depriving the animals of sensory experiences, a study has also been conducted measuring the consequences of enriching animal sensory experiences on prefrontal cortex development, via tactile stimulation by researchers for 45 minutes per day for the approximately first two weeks of life.  What was discovered was that infants, who received additional tactile stimulation exhibited greater motor performance and spatial learning, in addition to enhanced cerebral cortex synaptic organization, in adulthood, than infants who did not receive additional tactile stimulation.  These findings reinforce the significance of tactile stimulation in early stages of postnatal development and neurogenesis for rodent models.  Because non-human animal studies typically concern either, the presence and absence of parents, or the presence and absence of tactile stimulation, the findings of animal studies on gene expression are likely more comparable to human cases of neglect, as opposed to physical or sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb et al., [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/10/04/1121251109.long "Experience and the developing prefrontal cortex"], "PNAS", 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society for Social Neuroscience==
A dinner to discuss the challenges and opportunities in the interdisciplinary field of social neuroscience at the [[Society for Neuroscience]] meeting ([[Chicago]], November 2009) resulted in a series of meetings led by [[John Cacioppo]] and [[Jean Decety]] with social neuroscientists, [[psychologists]], [[neuroscientist]]s, [[psychiatrists]] and [[neurologist]]s in [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Chile]], [[China]], [[Colombia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Social neuroscience was defined broadly as the interdisciplinary study of the neural, hormonal, cellular, and genetic mechanisms underlying the emergent structures that define social species. Thus, among the participants in these meetings were scientists who used a wide variety of methods in studies of animals as well as humans, and patients as well as normal participants. The consensus also emerged that a Society for Social Neuroscience should be established to give scientists from diverse disciplines and perspectives the opportunity to meet, communicate with, and benefit from the work of each other. The international, interdisciplinary [[Society for social neuroscience]] (http://S4SN.org) was launched at the conclusion of these consultations in [[Auckland]], New Zealand on 20 January 2010, and the inaugural meeting for the Society was held on November 12, 2010, the day prior to the 2010 Society for Neuroscience meeting ([[San Diego]], CA).

'''Space for Life''' ({{lang-fr|Espace pour la vie}}) is a museum district in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. It brings together the city's four most prominent natural museums: the [[Montreal Biodome]] and the [[Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium]], situated in [[Olympic Park, Montreal|Montreal's Olympic Park]], and the [[Montreal Botanical Garden]] and [[Montréal Insectarium|Montreal Insectarium]], in the adjacent [[Maisonneuve Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Harrold, "'It will be the most avant-garde planetarium'; Building to attain high environmental certification," ''Montreal Gazette'', 2 February 2012, A4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Space for Life was established in 2011 as a successor body to Montreal Nature Museums.&lt;ref&gt;"Space for Life: New way to view nature," ''National Post'', 5 May 2012, WP7.&lt;/ref&gt; It describes itself as the largest natural sciences complex in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espacepourlavie.ca/en/what-space-life What Is Space for Life?], Espace pour la vie Montréal, accessed 7 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, its executive director is Charles-Mathieu Brunelle and [[Montreal executive committee]] member [[Manon Gauthier]] is responsible for its political oversight.&lt;ref&gt;"The Societe des musees quebecois awards it 2013 Prix Excellence to The Montreal Space for Life for the creation of the Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium," ''Canada NewsWire'', 10 October 2013; [http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/coderre-names-executive-committee-1.1548740 Coderre names executive committee], CTV News, 19 November 2013, accessed 5 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== What is Space for Life ? ==
{{Advert section|date=February 2017}}

The [[Montreal Biodome]], [[Insectarium]], [[Botanical Garden]] and [[Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium]] invite us to rethink the ties between human beings and nature, cultivating a new way of living. Together, the four prestigious institutions form a place where nature and science are honoured. They have positioned themselves as a Space for Life and are dedicated to sharing their vast heritage and knowledge with you.

Space for Life is a place that brings together the Montreal Biodome, Insectarium, Botanical Garden and Planetarium, but it is also much more. It’s a participatory movement and a commitment to biodiversity. It is a vast project based on citizen participation and co-creation with visitors. Just like nature belongs to everyone, it is everyone’s movement. It’s a state of mind, a way of experiencing nature. It is a space we visit where we can exchange, collaborate and learn.

=== The mission ===

Through its efforts in communication, conservation, education and research, Space for Life guides humans to better experience nature.

=== Space for Life is a place ===

The Space for Life comprises the Montreal Biodome,Botanical Garden, Insectarium and Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium. The institutions are interdependent, and designed to inspire visitors to adopt a new way of experiencing nature. They are connected by the Grande Place, a space that inspires new ways of coming together, enjoying the site, playing outside, building, interacting and experiencing everyday life.

Space for Life is the largest natural science museum complex in Canada, one of the leading tourist sites in Montréal and all of Quebec and a place with immense potential to impress and thrill visitors through nature, explain nature and encourage behaviour that is respectful of nature.

=== Space for Life is a commitment ===

Space for Life is also committed to increasing awareness of our planet’s biodiversity and encouraging people to better protect it. In fact, our four institutions have created a sustainable development charter.

By offering visitors immersive experiences combining science and emotion, the Biodôme, Botanical Garden, Insectarium and Planetarium invite us all to look at nature differently.

We have a collective commitment to nature, but also a commitment to achievement, meaningfulness and mobilization.

=== Space for Life is a movement ===

With their participatory, unifying approach that is authentic, inventive, committed and open to the world, our four institutions have joined forces to create a movement, a Space for Life; a place where people come together to create, shaped by Montrealers and visitors from around the world.

Space for Life has initiated a movement that aims to help people better understand the concept of interdependence underlying biodiversity, become aware of the services provided by nature and gradually change the way they live. Our institutions invite you to join the movement, by taking an active part and spreading the message yourself.

The Space for Life is a collective initiative encouraging Montrealers and local stakeholders to become involved and make it their own.

'''A movement to get closer to nature'''
'''A participatory, creative, historic movement'''

=== Sustainable development at Space for Life ===
At Space for Life, our approach to sustainable development informs all our decisions and actions, encouraging us to consider the inextricable connections between society, ethics, the economy and the environment.

With this goal in mind, we are committed to integrating sustainable development principles in all our activities. This includes our charter of commitment and 11 areas of focus:

*Biodiversity;
*Natural and cultural heritage;
*Environmentally responsible practices;
*Waste management;
*Natural resource management;
*Sustainable transportation;
*Ecodesign;
*Information, awareness and education;
*Governance and the workplace;
*Economic activity;
*Social engagement.

==== Major project ====


Montréal Space for Life is the largest natural science museum complex in Canada. By 2019, four major projects will have been developed, creating constantly evolving and changing spaces for life.

==== As Montreal's 375th anniversary approaches ====

The Insectarium Metamorphosis, the Biodôme Migration and two other major Space for Life projects are a legacy for Montrealers, for the planet and for future generations.

At a time when the issues the planet is facing, especially those related to the loss of biodiversity, raise the question of the relevance of our modern lifestyles, Space for Life, which is rooted in these unique institutions whose reputation and credibility are recognized both locally and internationally, has a fundamental role to play.

These two projects – characterized by their uniqueness, both in terms of architecture and design and the memorable and distinctive experiences they offer visitors – will let Space for Life truly play its role by inviting citizens to reconnect with nature and invent new ways of living. Reflecting a multidisciplinary vision wherein the architectural gesture emerges from a global creative approach, a bold architectural design will create living spaces that are permeable, ecological and evolving, while meeting the highest green building standards.

==== The Insectarium’s Metamorphosis ====

===== Winning Submission =====
Kuehn Malvezzi, Pelletier De Fontenay, Jodoin Lamarre Pratte, Dupras Ledoux and NCK

===== The project =====

'''A unique experience'''

The Insectarium will become a true biotope in which insects, plants and people can interact and take an interest in one another. In an architectural space that is both a landscape and an organism, the underground and closed spaces, water, shadow and daylight follow and play off one another along a route that plunges visitors into an immersive, sensory experience in the heart of the world of insects.

===== Technical Aspects =====

*Materials encouraging the greatest proximity with the insects (water, glass)
*New immersive space (butterfly house)
*Changes in architectural and museographic scale and perspective
*Individual experience spaces (face-to-face with insects)
*Museum functional spaces (laboratories, greenhouses, breeding facilities, offices)
*Transparent openings revealing the building’s ecological workings and the support processes for the live insects

==== Biodôme Migration ====

===== The design team =====

KANVA + NEUF architect(e)s, Bouthillette Parizeau + NCK

===== The project =====

'''A renewed experience, re-thinking the deeper meaning of the ecosystems.''' 

The Migration project will revamp the Biodôme and its scenic design, in most areas accessible to the public, to offer an innovative, participatory, immersive experience. The architects compare the Biodôme to a living organism and their concept echoes notions of cellular biology. The cell, the basic building block of life, becomes a model for structuring and shaping the building blocks of nature – ecosystems. The design team is proposing to reorganize the spaces, open up the centre of the Biodôme, and offer bold, complementary experiences.

The overall project budget is $22 million. This includes professional and project management fees, studies, construction costs, restoration, acquisition and relocation of live collections, museology, furniture, various contingencies, etc.

===== Technical Aspects =====
*A curved wall wraps around each ecosystem like a sensitive, delicate skin.
*A mezzanine with a lookout and new perspectives on all the ecosystems.
*The sub-Antarctic region will be expanded and the sub-Arctic region will become more immersive.
*The scenic design in some of the habitats will be redone, for a more immersive and moving visitor experience, appealing to the senses:
*Tropical Forest: larger numbers and more visible birds, fish and invertebrates
*Laurentian Maple Forest: visitors will be closer to the animals
*Gulf of St. Lawrence: reconfigured architecture and scenic design
*New welcoming and distinctive spaces where visitors can wander freely and intuitively.
*A grandiose main lobby, opened up and reconfigured to suit the scale of the building.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10743">The term '''standard social science model''' ('''SSSM''') was first introduced by [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]] in the 1992 edited volume ''[[The Adapted Mind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Barkow, Jerome; Cosmides, Leda &amp; Tooby, John (1992). ''The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture''. Oxford University Press. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  They used SSSM as a reference to [[social science]] philosophies related to the [[blank slate]], [[relativism]], [[social constructionism]], and [[cultural determinism]]. They argue that those philosophies, capsulized within SSSM, formed the dominant theoretical [[paradigm]] in the development of the [[social science]]s during the 20th century. According to their proposed SSSM paradigm, the mind is a general-purpose cognitive device shaped almost entirely by culture.&lt;ref&gt;"instinct." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2011. Web. 08 Feb. 2011. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/289249/instinct].&lt;/ref&gt; After establishing SSSM, Tooby and Cosmides make a case for replacing SSSM with the integrated model (IM), also known as the integrated causal model (ICM), which melds cultural and biological theories for the development of the mind. Supporters of SSSM include those who feel the term was conceived as a point of argument in support of ICM specifically and [[evolutionary psychology]] (EP) in general.

== Alleged proponents ==
[[Steven Pinker]] names several prominent scientists as proponents of the standard social science model, including [[Franz Boas]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[B. F. Skinner]], [[Richard Lewontin]], [[John Money]], and [[Stephen Jay Gould]].&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]]. [[The Blank Slate]]. New York: Penguin. 2002{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative theoretical paradigm: the integrated model ==
The authors of ''The Adapted Mind'' have argued&lt;ref&gt;Tooby, J., &amp; Cosmides, L. (1992). The adapted mind.{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the SSSM is now out of date and that a progressive model for the social sciences requires evolutionarily-informed models of nature-nurture interactionism, grounded in the [[computational theory of mind]].  Tooby and Cosmides refer to this new model as the integrated model (IM).

Tooby and Cosmides&lt;ref&gt;Tooby, J., &amp; Cosmides, L. (1992){{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide several comparisons between the SSSM and the IM, including the following:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Standard Social Science Model !! Integrated Model
|-
| Humans born a blank slate || Humans are born with a bundle of emotional, motivational and cognitive adaptations
|-
| Brain is a "general-purpose" computer  || Brain is a collection of modular, domain-specific processors
|-
| Culture/socialization programs behavior || Behavior is the result of interactions between evolved psychological mechanisms and cultural and environmental influences
|-
| Cultures free to vary any direction on any trait || Culture itself is based on a universal human nature and is constrained by it
|-
| Biology is relatively unimportant in understanding behavior || An analysis of interactions between nature and nurture is important in understanding behavior
|}

== Criticisms ==

{{POV|date=June 2014}}

Richardson (2007) argues that, as proponents of evolutionary psychology (EP), evolutionary psychologists developed the SSSM as a [[Rhetoric device|rhetorical technique]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;The basic move is evident in Cosmides and Tooby's most aggressive brief for evolutionary psychology. They want us to accept a dichotomy between what they call the "Standard Social Science Model" (SSSM) and the "Integrated Causal Model" (ICM) they favor ... it offers a false dichotomy between a manifestly untenable view and their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Richardson |first1= Robert C. |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Evolutionary Psychology As Maladapted Psychology |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KeqiKNFa3YgC&amp;pg=PA176 |edition= |year= 2007 |publisher= [[MIT Press]] |location= Cambridge, Mass. |isbn= 978-0-262-18260-7 |page= 176 |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Wallace (2010) has also suggested the SSSM to be a false dichotomy and claims that "scientists in the EP tradition wildly overstate the influence and longevity of what they call the Standard Social Science Model (essentially, [[behaviorism]]) of human cognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wallace |first= Brendan |authorlink= |title= Getting Darwin Wrong: Why Evolutionary Psychology Won't Work |url= |accessdate= |year= 2010 |publisher= Imprint Academic |location= Exeter |isbn= 978-1-84540-207-5 |page= 136 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey Sampson]] argues that the SSSM is based on a [[straw man]]. He views Pinker's claim that the SSSM has been the dominant theoretical paradigm in the social sciences since the 1920s as "completely untenable". In his argument, Sampson cites British education policies in the 20th century that were guided by social scientists and which were based on the belief that children had in-built talents and needs. Thus, he challenges Pinker's assertion that the view of the mind among all social scientists is a [[tabula rasa]]. Moreover, Sampson only conditionally agrees that the scientists Pinker associates with the SSSM, such as Skinner, Watson,{{who|reason=who is this particular watson?|date=November 2018}} and Mead, were influential, stating, "to identify them as responsible for the general tone of intellectual life for eighty years seems comical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Sampson |first1= Geoffrey |authorlink1= Geoffrey Sampson |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= The "Language Instinct" Debate: Revised Edition |url= |edition= |year= 2009 |publisher= Continuum |location= London |isbn= 978-0-8264-7384-4 |page= |pages= 134–5 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Neil Levy appears to concur with Sampson's straw man thesis regarding the conception of the SSSM, against which evolutionary psychologists direct much of their criticism. Levy writes: "No-one—not even Skinner and his followers—has ever believed in the blank slate of Pinker's title."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Levy |first1= Neil |last2= |first2= |year= 2004 |title= Evolutionary Psychology, Human Universals, and the Standard Social Science Model |journal= [[Biology and Philosophy]] |volume= 19 |issue= 3 |pages= 459–72|publisher= [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |doi= 10.1023/B:BIPH.0000036111.64561.63 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.90.9290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hilary Rose (sociologist)|Hilary Rose]] has criticized Tooby and Cosmides' arbitrary exclusion of [[economics]] and [[political science]] from their SSSM model, which Rose argues is "rather like excluding physiology and biochemistry from an account of the life sciences". She also states that Tooby and Cosmides have publicly indicted [[Sociology|sociologists]] and [[Anthropologist|anthropologists]] of inappropriate separatist behavior towards other academic disciplines while ignoring their newer efforts that demonstrate the complete opposite. Rose notes how sociologists and anthropologists have many new developments that involve study of the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] and technology. Furthermore, Rose suggests that Tooby and Cosmides' characterization of scientists like Gould, Lewontin, [[Steven Rose]] and [[Leon Kamin]] as SSSM adherents is based on an inaccurate reading of works like ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' and ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'', two books that have explored the interplay between biology and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Rose |first= Hilary |authorlink= Hilary Rose (sociologist) |title= Alas Poor Darwin: Arguments Against Evolutionary Psychology |editor1-last= Rose |editor1-first= Steven |editor2-last= Rose |editor2-first= Hilary |chapter= Colonising the Social Sciences? |chapterurl= https://books.google.fr/books?id=HQthCC191y8C&amp;pg=PT203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= London |publisher= [[Vintage Books|Vintage]] |isbn= 978-0-09-928319-5 |year= 2001 |pages= 203–212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Hampton (2004) contends that evolutionary psychologists' account of the SSSM misses the debate on the existence of psychological [[instinct]]s in the early part of the 20th century. He argues: &lt;blockquote&gt;psychological and behavioural thinkers have for long periods been immersed in the implications of Darwinism. It is plainly and factually incorrect for evolutionary psychology to deny this. And it is disingenuous to down-play it. Evolutionary psychologists who use the term "Standard Social Science Model" and rhetorical equivalents such as "the neo-behaviourist tradition" ... and "the tabula rasa view" ... undermine their own much-vaunted rigor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Hampton |first= Simon Jonathan | date = 2004 |title= The instinct debate and the standard social science model |journal= Sexualities, Evolution &amp; Gender |volume= 6 |issue= 1|pages= 15–44 | publisher= Routledge |doi= 10.1080/14616660412331279657}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''structural pipe fitting''', also known as a '''slip on pipe fitting''', '''clamp''' or '''pipe clamp''' is used to build structures such as handrails, guardrails, and other types of pipe or tubular structure. They can also be used to build furniture and theatrical riggings. The fittings slip on the pipe and are usually locked down with a [[set screw]]. The set screw can then be tightened with a simple [[hex wrench]]. Because of the [[modular design]] of standard fittings, assembly is easy, only simple hand tools are required, and risks from welding a structure are eliminated.

Other advantages of using structural [[Piping fitting|pipe fittings]] are easy installation and reconfigurable design. Since there are no permanent welds in the structure, the set screws of the fittings can simply be loosened, allowing them to be repositioned. The project can be disassembled and stored if needed, or even taken apart with fittings and pipe recycled into a new project.

Fittings used for strong structures are [[galvanised]] malleable iron castings, and come in many styles such as elbows, tees, crosses, reducers and flanges. The fittings are not threaded; they simply lock onto the pipe with the supplied hex set screws.

''' Tzippori Synagogue''' ('''Sepphoris Synagogue''') is an ancient synagogue discovered in [[Tzippori]], a Roman-era Jewish city in the [[Galilee]], now an archaeological site and a national park in [[Israel]]. 

==History==
Based on numismatic evidence, the synagogue appears to have been built in the first half of the fifth century. It was located on the northern side of the city, not far from the city center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeology.huji.ac.il/Zippori/mosaic.htm The Mosaic Pavements of Roman and Byzantine Zippori]&lt;/ref&gt; Measuring 20.7 meters long and 8 meters wide, it is the narrowest ancient synagogue uncovered in the [[Land of Israel]]. The [[Bema#Judaism|bimah]] was located in the western wall, not oriented towards Jerusalem as in other synagogues of that era.&lt;ref name=aviam&gt;Mordechai Aviam, ''Ancient Synagogues in the Land of Israel'', Israel Nature and Parks Authority, 1997, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mishna]] describes Tzippori as having had 18 synagogues at the time of the funeral of Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] in the late second century CE.&lt;ref name=aviam/&gt;

==Discovery==
The mosaic floor of the ancient synagogue was discovered in 1993 by a crew building a parking lot at the edge of the national archaeological park of Tzippori.&lt;ref name=art&gt;Steven Fine, ''Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman world: toward a new Jewish archaeology'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of a handful of illustrated synagogue mosaics uncovered in Israel. Archaeologist [[Zeev Weiss]], then a graduate student at the Hebrew University, and his teacher, archaeologist [[Ehud Netzer]] were called to the scene, and Weiss uncovered the floor and its environs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/23883856/The-Sepphoris-Synagogue-Deciphering-an-Ancient-Message-through-Its-Archaeological-and-SocioHistorical-Contexts|title=The Sepphoris Synagogue: Deciphering an Ancient Message through Its Archaeological and Socio-Historical Contexts|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|date= May 2006|author=Steven Fine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mosaics==
The mosaic floor is divided into seven parts. Near the entrance is a scene showing the angels visiting [[Sarah]]. The next section shows the binding of [[Isaac]]. There is a large Zodiac with the names of the months written in Hebrew. [[Helios]] sits in the middle, in his sun chariot. Next, there is a row of three panels depicting the offerings in the [[Temple at Jerusalem]], including the [[Kodashim|"tamid" sacrifice]], the [[showbread]] and the basket of [[first fruits]]. Above this is a depiction of [[Aaron]] offering sacrifices in the [[Tabernacle]]. Above that is another row of three panels, a [[Torah Ark]], depicted as a pedimented building, and an incense shovel representing the incense shovels used in the Temple, flanked by two panels each displaying the seven-branched [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] from the Temple at Jerusalem surrounded by symbols of the Jewish holidays including the [[Lulav]] and [[Shofar]]. The top, or front of the building section of the floor, another row of three panels, shows two lions flanking a wreath, their paws resting on the head of an ox.&lt;ref&gt;Zeev Weiss, ''The Sepphoris Synagogue: Deciphering an Ancient Message through Its Archaeological and Socio-Historical Contexts''.Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society; Institute of Archaeology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

The largest panel or central sections of the mosaic is laid out as a large square containing a circle within a circle. This shows the Zodiac with Helios driving his chariot. As with the [[Hammat Tiberias Synagogue]] and the [[Beit Alfa Synagogue]], the Zodiac panel at Tzippori features [[Spandrels]] depicting the four seasons.&lt;ref name=report/&gt;

'''''What is a Masterpiece?''''' is a 1979 non-fiction book by British [[historian]] [[Kenneth Clark]]. It is a transcribed version of the [[Walter Neurath]] memorial lectures given by Clark. The work, initially released on 1 January 1979, received a [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] republication on 1 May 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Masterpiece?|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2432730.What_Is_a_Masterpiece_|publisher=[http://www.goodreads.com/ goodreads.com]|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Kenneth Clark]] had already achieved fame with a series of popular books while also serving as, from 1969 on, the writer, producer and presenter of the [[BBC]] programme, ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'', a pioneering television [[Television documentary|documentary series]]. The prestigious series earned a [[Peabody Award]] as well as general commercial success. In the work, he articulated his viewpoint that cultural, political, and scientific progress can be shown from society to society in the [[Western world]] as time passes through pieces of [[visual art]].

==Contents==
Clark's work on masterpieces emphatically supports the concept that there is such a thing as a masterpiece and that in some sense it may be objectively defined or comprehended. He opposes this to a certain form of [[cultural relativism]] that had become prominent in recent decades and may in part be attributed to the influence of [[postmodernism]]. In particular, the notion of a masterpiece was related to the balance between the particular (the fruits of the era in which the artist lived) with the universal (the grand themes raised by the human condition itself) in Clark's view.

Clark's definition of an artistic masterpiece was based on a number of different considerations and criteria that apply to different works produced in markedly different time periods and milieux. For example, in this particular work he argued that it is the "creation of an individual artist's authentic genius." At the same time, he expounded a number of other aspects that for him were essential in the configuration of a masterpiece: that it is "a confluence of memories and emotions forming a single idea", that it has "a power of recreating traditional forms so that they become expressive of an artist's own epoch and yet keep a relationship to the past". The highest masterpieces are said to be "illustrations of great themes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamal|first1=Peter A.|title=Cultural Contingencies: Behavior Analytic Perspectives on Cultural Practices|date=1997|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=0275957764|page=274|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3-VHz9PUGsC&amp;pg=PA274 |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark also implicitly excluded the erotic from considerations of what constituted a masterpiece, based on his perspective that a necessary condition is the balance between sense and form (works that are too sensual are, therefore, unbalanced and not to be categorised at masterpiece level).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trosman|first1=Harry|title=Contemporary Psychoanalysis and Masterworks of Art and Film|date=2000|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=0814782655|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9gj5RS7Oj1UC&amp;pg=PA65 |accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
