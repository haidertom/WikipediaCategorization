'''Fashion in the period 1795–1820''' in [[Europe]]an and European-influenced countries saw the final triumph of undress or informal styles over the [[brocade]]s, [[lace]], [[wig|periwig]]s and powder of the earlier [[1700–50 in Western fashion|18th century]]. In the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], no one wanted to appear to be a member of the French [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]], and people began using clothing more as a form of individual expression of the true self than as a pure indication of social status.&lt;ref&gt;Aaslestad, Katherine B.: "Sitten und Mode: Fashion, Gender, and Public Identities in Hamburg at the Turn of the Nineteenth Century, Gender in Transition: Discourse and Practice in German-Speaking Europe, University of Michigan Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the shifts that occurred in fashion at the turn of the 19th century granted the opportunity to present new public identities that also provided insights into their private selves. Katherine Aaslestad indicates how "fashion, embodying new social values, emerged as a key site of confrontation between tradition and change."&lt;ref&gt;Aaslestad, Katherine B.: "Sitten und Mode: Fashion, Gender, and Public Identities in Hamburg at the Turn of the Nineteenth Century, Gender in Transition: Discourse and Practice in German-Speaking Europe, University of Michigan Press, 2006, 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

For women's dress, the day to day outfit of the skirt and jacket style were practical and tactful, recalling the working class woman.&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro, Aileen: The Art of Dress: Fashion in England and France 1750–1820, Yale University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-300-06287-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's fashions followed [[Classicism|classical]] ideals, and tightly laced [[corset]]s were temporarily abandoned in favor of a high-waisted, natural figure.&lt;ref&gt;Four Hundred Years of Fashion, Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, V&amp;A Publications, 1984 p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; This natural figure was emphasized by being able to see the body beneath the clothing. Visible breasts were part of this classical look, and some characterized the breasts in fashion as solely aesthetic and sexual.&lt;ref&gt;Yalom, Marilyn, "A History of the Breast." (Knopf: New York, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Great Britain|Britain]], the era of Regency in England covered the years when King George III was deemed unfit to rule and his son, the Prince of Wales ruled England as Prince Regent before his accession as King George IV. But the broadest definition of the period, characterized by trends in fashion, architecture, culture, and politics, begins with the French Revolution of 1789 and ends with Queen Victoria’s rise to power. The names of popular persons who lived in this time are still famous: Napoleon I Bonaparte and Josephine, Madame Recamier, Jane Austen, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, Beau Brummell, Lady Emma Hamilton, Queen Louise of Prussia and her husband and many more. [[Beau Brummell]] introduced [[trousers]], perfect [[tailor]]ing, and unadorned, immaculate [[linen]] as the ideals of men's fashion. 

In [[Germany]], republican city-states relinquished their traditional, modest, and practical garments and started to embrace the French and English fashion trends of short-sleeved chemise dresses and Spencer jackets.&lt;ref name="Aaslestad, Katherine B. 2006"&gt;Aaslestad, Katherine B.: "Sitten und Mode: Fashion, Gender, and Public Identities in Hamburg at the Turn of the Nineteenth Century, Gender in Transition: Discourse and Practice in German-Speaking Europe, University of Michigan Press, 2006, 282-318.&lt;/ref&gt; American fashion trends emulated French dress, but in a toned down manner with shawls and tunics to cope with the sheerness of the chemise.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Betty-Bright P., “Of Muslins and Merveilleuses,” Winterthur Portfolio, vol 9 (1974), 29-75.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[Spain]], members of the Aristocracy, as well as citizens of the lower class, united and rebelled against French enlightenment ideals and fashion by dressing as majas and [[majo]]s to contain their Spanish pride.&lt;ref&gt;Noyes, Dorothy: "La Maja Vestida: Dress as Resistance to Enlightenment in Late 18th-century Madrid," Journal of American Folklore, vol 111, no 440, 1998, 197-217.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the eighteenth century, a major shift in fashion was taking place that extended beyond changes in mere style to changes in philosophical and social ideals. Prior to this time, the style and traditions of the “[[Ancien Régime]]” prevented the conceptualization of “the self”. Instead, one's identity was considered malleable; subject to change depending on what clothes one was wearing. However, by the 1780s, the new, “natural” style allowed one's inner self to transcend their clothes.&lt;ref name="Dror Warman 2004 pp. 166-189"&gt;Dror Warman, The Making of the Modern Self: Identity and Culture in Eighteenth-Century England (Yale University Press, 2004), pp. 166-189, 265-278&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1790s, there was a new concept of the internal and external self. Before this time, there had only been one self, which was expressed through clothing. When going to a masquerade ball, people wore specific clothing, so they could not show their individuality through their clothing. &lt;ref name="Dror Warman 2004 pp. 166-189"/&gt; Incorporated in this new “natural” style was the importance of ease and comfort of one's dress. Not only was there a new emphasis on hygiene, but also clothing became much lighter and more able to be changed and washed frequently. Even upper class women began wearing cropped dresses as opposed to dresses with long trains or hoops that restricted them from leaving their homes. The subsequent near stasis of the silhouette inspired volumes of new trims and details on heavily trimmed skirts back into fashion. In the Regency years, complicated historic and orientalist elements provided lavish stylistic displays as such details were a vigorous vehicle for conspicuous consumption given their labor-intensive fabrications, and therefore a potent signifier of hierarchy for the upper classes who wore the styles.  This kind of statement was particularly noticeable in profuse trimmings, especially on skirts where unrestrained details were common, along with cut edge details and edge trims. 

Women's fashion was also influenced by male fashion, such as tailored waistcoats and jackets to emphasize women's mobility. This new movement toward practicality of dress showed that dress became less of a way to solely categorize between classes or genders; dress was meant to suit one's personal daily routine.&lt;ref&gt;Peter McNeil, "The Appearance of Enlightenment: Refashioning the Elites," in The Enlightenment Worlds, eds (Routledge, 2004), pp. 381-400&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during this time period that the fashion magazine and journal industry began to take off. They were most often monthly (often competing) periodicals that allowed men and women to keep up with the ever-changing styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The|first=Elizabeth Roslyn|title=Women’s Fashion: Fashion Plates, Illustrations, and Watercolours from 1790s to 1810s.|url=http://barbauldfashion.wordpress.com/2013/04/07/fashion/|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence of Industrial Revolution on fashion ==
[[File:Fashion Plate (The Russian and Prussian Bonnet and Pelisse) LACMA M.86.266.183.jpg|thumb|left|Fashion Plate (The Russian &amp; Prussian Bonnet &amp; Pelisse), published in ''[[La Belle Assemblée]]'', July 1, 1814]]

In the late 18th century, clothes were mostly sold by individual shopkeepers who were often the artisans who made the goods. Customers usually lived in the same neighborhood as the shops and the shops would gain popularity by their customers’ word-of–mouth recommendation, with the exception of warehouses (i.e., any retail on wholesale), where goods being sold were not necessarily made in the shop.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The art of dress: Clothes and society, 1500-1914|last = Ashelford|first = J|publisher = National Trust|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 195–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, things started to change during the transition to the 19th century. People sought efficiency and variety; under the influence of the [[Industrial Revolution]], improved transportation and introduction of machines in manufacturing allowed fashion to develop at an even faster pace.

The first sewing machine emerged in 1790, and later, Josef Madersperger began developing his first sewing machine in 1807, presenting his first working machine in 1814. The introduction of the sewing machine sped up garment production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meanwhile, advanced spinning, weaving and cotton-printing techniques developed in the 18th century had already brought detailed, washable fabrics. These durable and affordable fabrics became popular among the majority population. These techniques were further developed by the introduction of machines. Before, accessories like embroidery and lace were manufactured on a small and limited scale by skilled craftsmen and sold in their own shops; in 1804, a machine for embroidering was constructed by John Duncan, and people started producing these essential accessories in factories and dispatching the products to shops throughout the country. These technical developments in clothing production allowed a greater variety of styles; rapid changes in fashion also became possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Industrial Revolution bridged Europe and America with regards to travel. When Louis Simond first arrived to America, he was struck by the mobility of the population and frequency of people made trips to the capital, writing "you meet nowhere with those persons who never were out of their native place, and whose habits are wholly local — nobody above poverty
who has not visited London once in his life; and most of those who can, visit once a year.’&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; New canals and railways not only transported people, but created national and even broader markets by transporting goods that manufactured in factories in great distances. The rise of industry throughout the Western world increased garment production and people were encouraged to travel more widely and purchase more goods than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/European-Culture-19th-Century/Nineteenth-Century-Industrialization.html|title = Nineteenth-Century Industrialization|date = |accessdate = |website = Encyclopedia of Fashion|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication was also improved in this era. New ideas about fashion were conveyed by little dolls dressed in the latest style, newspapers, and illustrated magazines;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Patterns of fashion: The cut and construction of clothes for men and women|last = Arnold|first = J|publisher = Macmillan|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, [[La Belle Assemblée]], founded by [[John Bell (publisher)|John Bell]], was a British women's magazine published from 1806 to 1837.  It was best known for its fashion plates of Regency era styles, showing how women should dress and behave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.regencyhistory.net/2011/11/la-belle-assemblee.html|title = La Belle Assemblée|date = |accessdate = |website = Regency History|publisher = |last = Knowles|first = R}}&lt;/ref&gt; When fashion became available for everybody, people were expected to dress according to the latest fashion. Dressmakers would show the fashion-plates to their customers, so that customers could catch up to the latest styles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Women's fashion==
[[File:Fourth-position-feet-Wilson-Analysis-country-dancing-1811.jpg|thumb|1811 dance dress]]
[[File:Doña Isabel Cobos de Porc by Francisco Goya.jpg|thumb|In [[Spain]], some society ladies rebelled against [[French fashion]] by dressing as majas, like [[Portrait of Doña Isabel de Porcel|Doña Isabel de Porcel]], 1805.]]

===Overview===
In this period, fashionable women's clothing styles were based on the [[Empire silhouette]] — dresses were closely fitted to the torso just under the bust, falling loosely below. In different contexts, such styles are commonly called "[[Directoire style]]" (referring to the [[French Directory|Directory]] government of France during the second half of the 1790s), "[[Empire style]]" (referring to Napoleon's 1804–1814/1815 empire, and often also to his 1800–1804 "consulate"), or "[[British Regency|Regency]]" (loosely used to refer to various periods between the 18th century and the Victorian).

These 1795–1820 fashions were quite different from the styles prevalent during most of the 18th century and the rest of the 19th century, when women's clothes were generally tight against the torso from the natural waist upwards, and heavily full-skirted below (often inflated by means of [[hoop skirt]]s, [[crinoline]]s, [[Pannier (clothing)|panniers]], [[bustle]]s, etc.). Women’s fashion around this time started to follow classical ideals, inspired by the ancient Greek and Roman style with its gracious, loosely falling dresses that were gathered or just accentuated over the natural waist under the bust. For women, tightly laced corsets and brocade gave way to a celebration of the natural form. A woman’s body shape was to be celebrated. Bodices were short with waistlines falling just below the bust. The Empire silhouette defines a dress with a high waist and a long and loosely falling skirt, which lengthens and flatters the body but does not always make it look slim. Fabrics were light to the point of being sheer below the bodice, which made them easier to keep clean. Because gown fabrics were so light, women’s fashions consisted of three layers.

===Gowns===
Inspired by neoclassical tastes, ‘undress’ was the style of the day, casual and informal. It was the type of gown a woman wore from morning until noon or later depending on her social engagements of the day. The short-waisted dresses sported soft, loose skirts and were often made of white, almost transparent [[muslin]], which was easily washed and draped loosely like the garments on Greek and Roman statues. Since the fabric clung to the body, revealing what was underneath, it made nudity ''à la grecque'' a centerpiece of public spectacle.Satin was sometimes worn for evening wear.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Darcy G. "Nudity à La Grecque." The Art Bulletin 80.2 (1998): 311-35.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Half Dress’ is thought of as how one would dress when going out during the day or meeting with guests.‘Full Dress’ was what a lady wore to formal events, day or night. ‘Evening Dress’ was only appropriate at evening affairs.Thus during the 1795–1820 period, it was often possible for middle- and upper-class women to wear clothes that were not very confining or cumbersome, and still be considered decently and fashionably dressed.

Among middle- and upper-class women there was a basic distinction between "morning dress" (worn at home in the afternoons as well as mornings) and evening attire — generally, both men and women changed clothes in preparation for the evening meal and possible entertainments to follow. There were also further gradations such as afternoon dress, walking dress, [[riding habit]]s, travelling dress, dinner dress, etc.

In the ''Mirror of Graces; or the English Lady's Costume'', published in London in 1811, the author ("a Lady of Distinction") advised:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the morning the arms and bosom must be completely covered to the throat and wrists. From the dinner-hour to the termination of the day, the arms, to a graceful height above the elbow, may be bare; and the neck and shoulders unveiled as far as delicacy will allow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?type=header&amp;id=DLDecArts.MirrorGraces&amp;isize=M |title=Mirror of Graces; or the English Lady's Costume'' |accessdate=4 July 2009 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Morning dresses were worn inside the house. They were high-necked and long-sleeved, covering throat and wrists, and generally plain and devoid of decoration.
* Evening gowns were often extravagantly trimmed and decorated with lace, ribbons, and netting. They were cut low and sported short sleeves, baring bosoms. Bared arms were covered by long white gloves. Our Lady of Distinction, however, cautions young women from displaying their bosoms beyond the boundaries of decency, saying, "The bosom and shoulders of a very young and fair girl may be displayed without exciting much displeasure or disgust."

A Lady of Distinction also advised young ladies to wear softer shades of color, such as pinks, periwinkle blue, or lilacs. The mature matron could wear fuller colors, such as purple, black, crimson, deep blue, or yellow.

Many women of this era remarked upon how being fully dressed meant the bosom and shoulders were bare, and yet being under-dressed would mean one's neckline went right up to one's chin.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

=== Silhouette ===
Due to the importance of showing social status, the fashion industry was very much influenced by society during the Regency era. One's  position was determined by the person's wealth, etiquette, family status, intelligence, and beauty. Women financially and socially relied on their husbands. The only socially-acceptable activities in which women could participate centered around social gatherings and fashion, the most important component of which was attending evening parties. These parties helped to build relationships and connection with others. As etiquette dictated different standards of attire for different events, afternoon dress, evening dress, evening full dress, ball dress, and different type of dresses were popular.
[[File:Hortense-de-beauharnais-anne-louis-girodet-de-roucy-triosson.jpg|thumb|Joséphine de Beauharnais]]
Women's fashion in the Regency era started to change drastically. It popularized the empire silhouette, which featured a fitted bodice and high waist. This “new natural style” emphasized the beauty of the body's natural lines. Clothing became lighter and easier to care for than in the past. Women often wore several layers of clothing, typically undergarments, gowns, and outerwear. The chemise, the standard undergarment of the era, prevented the thin, gauzy dresses from being fully transparent. Outerwear, such as the spencer and the pelisse, were popular.

The empire silhouette was created in the late 18th century to about early 19th century, and referred to the period of the First French Empire. This adoption had been linked with France's Relation and adopted of Greek and Roman principles. The style was often worn in white to denote as a high social status. Josephine Bonaparte was the one of the figureheads for the Empire waistline, with her elaborated and decorated Empire line dresses. Regency women followed the Empire style along the same trend of raised waistlines as French styles, even when their countries were at war. Starting from the 1780s and early 1790s, women's silhouette became slimmer and the waistlines crept up. After 1795, waistlines rose dramatically and the skirt circumference was further reduced. Few years later, England and France started to show the focus of high waist style and this led to the creation of Empire style.
[[File:Merry Joseph Blondel - Felicite-Louise-Julie-Constance de Durfort.jpg|thumb|French lady in 1808; the style was often accompanied by a [[shawl]] or similar wrap, or a short "Spencer" jacket, as the dresses were light and left much uncovered]]
The style began as part of [[Neoclassical fashion]], reviving styles from [[Greco-Roman]] art which showed women wearing loose fitting rectangular [[tunic]]s known as [[peplos]] which were belted under the bust, providing support for women and a cool, comfortable outfit especially in warm climate. The empire silhouette was defined by the waistline, which was positioned directly under the bust. The Empire silhouette were the key style in women's clothing during the Regency era. The dresses were usually light, long and fit loosely, they were usually in white and often sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice which strongly emphasized thin hem and tied around the body. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently lain around the midriff when seated—for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favored. The dresses had a fitted bodice and it gave a high-waist appearance.

The style had waxed and waned in fashion for hundreds of years. The shape of the dresses also helped to lengthen the body's appearance. The clothing can also be draped to maximize the bust. Lightweight fabrics were typically used to create a flowing effect. Also, ribbon, sash, and other decorative features were used to highlight the waistline. The empire gowns were often with low neckline and short sleeves and women usually worn them as evening dresses. On the other hand, day gowns had higher neckline and long sleeves. The chemisette was a staple for fashionable ladies. Although there were differences between day dresses and evening dresses, the high waistline was not changed.

===Hairstyles and headgear===

During this period, the classical influence extended to hairstyles. Often masses of curls were worn over the forehead and ears, with the longer back hair drawn up into loose buns or ''Psyche knots'' influenced by Greek and Roman styles. By the later 1810s, front hair was parted in the center and worn in tight ringlets over the ears.&lt;ref name="fashion-era.com"/&gt; Adventurous women like [[Lady Caroline Lamb]] wore short cropped hairstyles "à la [[Titus]]", the ''[[Journal de Paris]]'' reporting in 1802 that "more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig ''à la Titus''", a layered cut usually with some tresses hanging down.&lt;ref&gt;Rifelj, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Mirror of Graces,'' a Lady of Distinction writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, easy tresses, the shining braid, the flowing ringlet confined by the ''antique'' comb, or bodkin, give graceful specimens of the simple taste of modern beauty. Nothing can correspond more elegantly with the untrammeled drapery of our newly-adopted classic raiment than this undecorated coiffure of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?type=header&amp;id=DLDecArts.MirrorGraces&amp;isize=M |title=Mirror of Graces; or the English Lady's Costume'' |accessdate=4 July 2009 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Conservative married women continued to wear linen [[mob cap]]s, which now had wider brims at the sides to cover the ears. Fashionable women wore similar caps for morning (at home undress) wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jane Austen Centre Magazine |url=http://www.janeausten.co.uk/magazine/index.ihtml?pid=299&amp;step=4 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gU5brgbH?url=http://www.janeausten.co.uk/magazine/index.ihtml?pid=299&amp;step=4 |archivedate=2009-05-03 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in centuries, respectable but daringly fashionable women would leave the house without a hat or [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]], previously something often associated with prostitutes. However most women continued to wear something on their head outdoors, though they were beginning to cease to do so indoors during the day (as well as for evening wear). The antique head-dress, or Queen Mary ''[[coif]]'', Chinese hat, Oriental inspired turban, and Highland helmet were popular. As for bonnets, their crowns and brims were adorned with increasingly elaborate ornamentations, such as feathers and ribbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.regencygarderobe.com/Monthly%20QA%20Pages/BonnetsPart2.htm |title=Regency Fashion and Costume |access-date=2006-09-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040306115929/http://www.regencygarderobe.com/Monthly%20QA%20Pages/BonnetsPart2.htm |archive-date=2004-03-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, ladies of the day embellished their hats frequently, replacing old decorations with new trims or feathers.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Undergarments===
[[File:Regency-underclothes detail.png|left|thumb|1811 illustration of underclothes, showing one form of Regency "stays"]]

Fashionable women of the [[Regency era]] wore several layers of [[undergarments]]. The first was the [[chemise]], or shift, a thin garment with tight, short sleeves (and a low neckline if worn under evening wear), made of white cotton and finished with a plain hem that was shorter than the dress. These shifts were meant to protect the outer-clothes from perspiration and were washed more frequently than outer clothes. In fact, washer women of the time used coarse soap when scrubbing these garments, then plunged them in boiling water, hence the absence of color, lace, or other embellishments, which would have faded or damaged the fabric under such rough treatment. Chemises and shifts also prevented the transparent [[muslin]] or silk dresses from being too revealing.

The next layer was a pair of stays or [[corset]]. However, high-waisted classical fashions required no corset for the slight of figure, and there were some experiments to produce garments which would serve the same functions as a modern brassiere. (In the ''Mirror of Graces'', a "divorce" was described as an undergarment that served to separate a woman's breasts. Made of steel or iron that was covered by a type of padding, and shaped like a triangle, this device was placed in the center of the chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?type=header&amp;id=DLDecArts.MirrorGraces&amp;isize=M |title=Mirror of Graces; or the English Lady's Costume'' |accessdate=4 July 2009 |pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;) "Short stays" (corsets extending only a short distance below the breasts) were often worn over the shift or chemise (not directly next to the skin), and "long stays" (corsets extending down towards the natural waist) were worn by a minority of women trying to appear slimmer than they were (but even such long stays were not primarily intended to constrict the waist, in the manner of Victorian corsets.)

The final layer was the [[petticoat]], which could have a scooped neckline and was sleeveless, and was fitted in the back with hooks and [[eyelets]], [[Button (clothing)|buttons]] or tapes. These petticoats were often worn between the underwear and the outer dress and was considered part of the outer clothing not underwear. The lower edge of the petticoat was intended to be seen, since women would often lift their outer dresses to spare the relatively delicate material of the outer dress from mud or damp (so exposing only the coarser and cheaper fabric of the petticoat to risk). Often exposed to view, petticoats were decorated at the hem with rows of tucks or lace, or ruffles.

"Drawers" (underpants with short legs) were only beginning to be worn by a few women during this period. They were tied separately around the waist.

Stockings ([[hosiery]]), made of silk or knitted cotton, were held up by [[garters]] below the knee until [[suspenders]] were introduced in the late 19th century and were often of a white or pale flesh color &lt;ref&gt;"The Costume Book, Nesfield, Cookson. 1935:New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outerwear and shoes===
[[File:Ingres, Madame Riviere.jpg|thumb|''[[Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière|Madame Rivière]]'', 1806, [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], [[The Louvre|Louvre]].]]

During this time period, women's clothing was much thinner than in the [[eighteenth century]] so warmer outerwear became important in fashion, especially in colder climates. Coat-like garments such as pelisses and redingotes were popular, as were shawls, mantles, mantelets, capes and cloaks. The mantelet was a short cape that was eventually lengthened and made into a shawl. The redingote, another popular example, was a full-length garment resembling a man's riding coat (hence the name) in style, that could be made of different fabrics and patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Low|first=Betty-Bright P.|author2=Josephine du Pont and Margaret Manigault|title=Of Muslins and Merveilleuses: Excerpts from the Letters of Josephine du Pont and Margaret Manigault|journal=Winterthur Portfolio|year=1974|volume=9|pages=29–75|jstor=1180568|doi=10.1086/495824}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the period, the [[India]]n [[shawl]] was the favoured wrap,&lt;ref name="Payne_outer"&gt;Payne 1965, p. 447–449&lt;/ref&gt; as houses and the typical [[English country house]] were generally draughty, and the sheer muslin and light silk dresses popular during this time provided less protection. Shawls were made of soft [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]] or [[silk]] or even [[muslin]] for summer. Paisley patterns were extremely popular at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victoriana.com/library/paisley/shawl.html|title=Paisley Shawl - Shawls of Paisley Design|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short (high-waisted) jackets called ''spencers''&lt;ref name="Payne_outer" /&gt; were worn outdoors, along with long-hooded [[cloaks]], Turkish wraps, mantles, capes, Roman tunics, [[chemisette]]s, and overcoats called ''pelisses''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/austen/pelisse.html|title=Jane Austen's Hampshire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which were often sleeveless and reached down as far as the ankles). These outer garments were often made of double sarsnet, fine Merino cloth, or velvets, and trimmed with fur, such as swan's down, fox, chinchilla, or sable. On May 6, 1801, Jane Austen wrote her sister Cassandra, "Black gauze cloaks are worn as much as anything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/brablet5.html |title=Letters of Jane Austen |accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thin, flat fabric (silk or velvet) or leather slippers were generally worn (as opposed to the high-heeled shoes of much of the 18th century).

Metal [[pattens]] were strapped on shoes to protect them from rain or mud, raising the feet an inch or so off the ground.

===Accessories===
[[File:LaBelleAssembleeLondon1813.jpg|thumb|ca. 1813]]

[[Gloves]] were always worn{{by whom|date=January 2013}} outside the house. When worn inside, as when making a social call, or on formal occasions, such as a ball, they were removed when dining.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=18890 Musee du Louvre] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the length of the glove, A Lady of Distinction writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If the prevailing fashion be to reject the long sleeve, and to partially display the arm, let the glove advance considerably above the elbow, and there be fastened with a [[draw-string]] or armlet. But this should only be the case when the arm is muscular, coarse, or scraggy. When it is fair, smooth, and round, it will admit of the glove being pushed down to a little above the wrists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?type=header&amp;id=DLDecArts.MirrorGraces&amp;isize=M |title=Mirror of Graces; or the English Lady's Costume'' |accessdate=4 July 2009 |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Longer gloves were worn rather loosely during this period, crumpling below the elbow. As described in the passage above, "garters" could fasten longer gloves.

[[Reticule (handbag)|Reticule]]s held personal items, such as [[smelling salts|vinaigrette]]s. The form-fitting dresses or frocks of the day had no pockets, thus these small drawstring handbags were essential. These handbags were often called buskins or balantines. They were rectangular in shape and was worn suspended by a woven band from a belt placed around the figure above the waist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bigelow|first=Marybelle S.|title=Fashion in History: Western Dress, Prehistoric to Present|date=1979|publisher=Burgess Publishing Company|location=Minneapolis|pages=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parasols]] (as shown in the illustration) protected a lady's skin from the sun, and were considered an important fashion accessory. Slender and light in weight, they came in a variety of shapes, colors, and sizes.

Fashionable ladies (and gentlemen) used [[Fan (implement)|fans]] to cool themselves and to enhance gestures and body language. Made of paper or silk on sticks of ivory and wood, and printed with oriental motifs or popular scenes of the era, these ubiquitous accessories featured a variety of shapes and styles, such as pleated or rigid. An information sheet from the [[Cheltenham Museum]] describes fans and their use in body language and communication (click and scroll to page 4).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cheltenhammuseum.org.uk/search/fans_info_sheet.pdf Cheltenham Art Gallery &amp; Museum]

By the mid-1790s, neoclassical clothing had come into fashion in France.&lt;ref name="Cage 2009 193–215"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cage|first=E. Claire|title=The Sartorial Self: Neoclassical Fashion and Gender Identity in France, 1797-1804|journal=Eighteenth-Century Studies|year=2009|volume=42|issue=2|pages=193–215|doi=10.1353/ecs.0.0039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several influences had combined to bring about this simplification in women's clothing: aspects of Englishwomen's practical country outdoor-wear leaked up into French high fashion, and there was a reaction in revolutionary France against the stiffly boned corsets and brightly colored satins and other heavy fabrics that were in style in the Ancien Régime (see [[1750–1795 in fashion]]). But ultimately, [[Neo-classicism]] was adopted for its association with classical republican ideas [with reference to Greece, rather than republican Rome, which was now considered politically dangerous].&lt;ref name="Cage 2009 193–215"/&gt; This renewed fascination of the classical past was encouraged by the recent discoveries of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and would likely have not been possible outside such a specific geographic and historical setting that allowed the idea of the past made present to become paramount.&lt;ref name="Hornsby 2000 123–146"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hornsby|first=Clare|title=The Impact of Italy: The Grand Tour and Beyond|year=2000|publisher=The British School at Rome|pages=123–146|chapter=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the influences of the Pompeii and Herculaneum excavations, several other factors came together to popularize neoclassical dress. Starting in the early 1790s, [[Emma Hamilton]] began her performances of attitudes, something that was considered by contemporaries as entirely new. These attitudes were based loosely on the ancient practice of pantomime, though Emma's performances lacked masks and musical accompaniment.&lt;ref name="Hornsby 2000 123–146"/&gt; Her performances created a fusion between art and nature; art came alive and her body became a type of art.&lt;ref name="Wurst 2001 151–181"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wurst|first=Karin A.|title=Spellbinding: The Body as Art/Art as Body in the Cultural Practice of Attitüden|journal=Lessing Yearbook 2001|year=2001|volume=33|pages=151–181}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an aid to her performances of tragic mythological and historical figures, Emma wore the clothing á la grecque that would become popular in mainstream France in the coming years. A simple light colored chemise made from thin, flowing material was worn and gathered with a narrow ribbon under the breasts. Simple cashmere shawls were used as headdresses or to give more fullness to the drapery of the chemise. They also helped to prevent broken lines in the performance so that the outstretched arms were always connected with the body, escalating the effect of fluid movement, and oftentimes, a cape or a cloak was worn to emphasize the lines of the body in certain poses. This highlighted the continuity of surface of line and form in the body of the performer to emphasize the unity, simplicity, and continuously flowing movement from one part of the body to the next. The hair was worn in a natural, loose, and flowing fashion. All of these properties blended together to allow an extensive play of light and shadow to reveal and accent certain parts of the body during the performance, while covering others.&lt;ref name="Wurst 2001 151–181"/&gt; Emma was highly capable in her attitudes, and the influence of her dress spread from Naples to Paris as wealthy Parisians took the Grand Tour.

[[File:Toomuch-1556 Toolittle-1796 caricature.jpg|thumb|left|A satirical 1796 contrast between old Elizabethan and Directoire clothing styles: ''Too Much and Too Little'', reads the caption of this caricature by [[Isaac Cruikshank]] ]]
There is also some evidence that the white muslin shift dress became popular after Thermidor through the influence of prison dress. Revolutionary women such as Madame Tallien portrayed themselves in this way because it was the only clothing they possessed during their time in prison. The chemise á la grecque also represented the struggle for representation of the self and the stripping down of past cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;Freund, Amy. "The Citoyenne Tallien: Women, Politics, and Portraiture during the French Revolution," Art Bulletin, vol. 93 no. 3 (2011), 325-344.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a simplification of the attire worn by preteen girls in the 1780s (who were no longer required to wear [[:File:1778-Bourgeois-daughter-fashion.jpg|miniature versions of adult stays and panniers]]) probably paved the way for the simplification of the attire worn by teenage girls and adult women in the 1790s. Waistlines became somewhat high by 1795, but skirts were still rather full, and neoclassical influences were not yet dominant.

It was during the second half of the 1790s that fashionable women in France began to adopt a thoroughgoing Classical style, based on an idealized version of ancient Greek and Roman dress (or what was thought at the time to be ancient Greek and Roman dress), with narrow clinging skirts. Some of the extreme Parisian versions of the neoclassical style (such as narrow straps which bared the shoulders, and diaphanous dresses without sufficient stays, petticoats, or shifts worn beneath) were not widely adopted elsewhere, but many features of the late-1790s neoclassical style were broadly influential, surviving in successively modified forms in European fashions over the next two decades.

With this Classical style came the willingness to expose the breast. With the new iconography of the Revolution as well as a change in emphasis on maternal breast-feeding, the chemise dress became a sign of the new egalitarian society.&lt;ref&gt;Yalom, Marilyn. A History of the Breast. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The style was simple and appropriate for the comfort of a pregnant or nursing woman as the breasts were emphasized and their availability was heightened. Maternity became fashionable and it was not uncommon for women to walk around with their breasts exposed. Some women took the “fashionable maternity” a step further and wore a “six-month pad” under their dress to appear pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Gelpi, Barbara C. "Significant Exposure: The Turn‐of‐the‐century Breast." Nineteenth-Century Contexts 20.2 (1997): 125-45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

White was considered the most suitable color for neoclassical clothing (accessories were often in contrasting colors). Short [[train (clothing)|trains]] trailing behind were common in dresses of the late 1790s.

===Empire (1800–1815)===
[[File:1815 English and French.jpg|thumb|English and French fashions, 1815. The [[morning dress]] has back gathers and long sleeves, and like the walking costume, has trim at the hemline and new detail at the upper sleeve.]]

During the first two decades of the 19th century, fashions continued to follow the basic high-waisted [[empire silhouette]], but in other respects neoclassical influences became progressively diluted. Dresses remained narrow in front, but fullness at the raised back waist allowed room to walk. Colors other than white came into style, the fad for diaphanous outer fabrics faded (except in certain formal contexts), and some elements of obvious visible ornamentation came back into use in the design of the dress (as opposed to the elegant simplicity or subtle white-on-white embroidery of the dress of ca. 1800).

This era signaled the loss of any lingering [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]], pseudo-Grecian styles in women's dress. This decline was especially evident in France due to the Emperor [[Napoleon|Napoleon's]] suppression of trade in the fabrics used in neoclassical dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cage|first=E.

Larger and more abundant decoration, especially near the hem and neckline foreshadowed greater extravagance in the coming years. More petticoats were being worn, and a stiffer, more cone-shaped skirt became popular. Stiffness could be supplemented by layers of ruffles and tucks on a hem, as well as corded or flounced petticoats. Sleeves began to be pulled, tied, and pinched in ways that were more influenced by [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[Gothic art|gothic]] styles than neoclassical. Hats and hairstyles became more elaborate and trimmed, climbing higher to balance widening skirts.

===Overview===
This period saw the final abandonment of [[lace]], [[embroidery]], and other embellishment from serious men's clothing outside of formalized [[court dress]]—it would not reappear except as an affectation of [[Artistic Dress movement|Aesthetic dress]] in the 1880s and its successor, the "Young Edwardian" look of the [[1960s in fashion|1960s]]. Instead, cut and tailoring became much more important as an indicator of quality.&lt;ref name="Payne_men"&gt;Payne 1865, pp. 452–455&lt;/ref&gt; This transformation can be attributed in part to an increased interest in antiquity stemming from the discovery of classical engravings, including the Elgin Marbles. The figures depicted in classical art were viewed as an exemplar of the ideal natural form, and an embodiment of Neoclassical ideas. The style in London for men became more and more refined and this was due to the influence of two things: the dandy and the romantic movement. The dandy (a man who placed high importance on personal aesthetics and hobbies but wanted to seem totally nonchalant about it) arguably emerged as early as the 1790s. Dark colors were all but mandatory. (Dark doesn’t necessarily mean dreary though, many items, particularly vests and coats were cut from rich, vivid fabrics.) Blue tailcoats with gold buttons, were everywhere. White muslin shirts (sometimes with ruffles on the neck/sleeves) were extremely popular. Breeches were officially on their way out, with pants/trousers taking their place. Fabrics in general were becoming more practical silk and more wool, cotton, and buckskin. Therefore, in the 18th century, dress was simplified and greater emphasis was put on tailoring to enhance the natural form of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hollander|first=Anne|title=Sex and Suits: The Evolution of Modern Dress|date=1995|publisher=Kodansha|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was also the period of the rise of [[hair wax]] for styling men's hair, as well as [[mutton chops]] as a style of facial hair.

[[Breeches]] became longer—tightly fitted leather riding breeches reached almost to the boot tops—and were replaced by pantaloons or [[trousers]] for fashionable street wear. The French Revolution is largely responsible for altering standard male dress. During the revolution, clothing symbolized the division between the upper classes and the working class revolutionaries. French rebels earned the nickname [[sans-culottes]], or "(the people without breeches," because of the loose floppy trousers they popularized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perl|first=Lila|title=From Top Hats to Baseball Caps, From Bustles to Blue Jeans|date=1990|publisher=Clarion Books|location=New York|isbn=0899198724|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coat (clothing)|Coats]] were cutaway in front with long skirts or tails behind, and had tall standing [[collar (clothing)|collars]]. Lapels were not as large as they had been in years before and often featured an M-shaped notch unique to the period.&lt;ref name="Payne_men" /&gt;

Shirts were made of linen, had attached collars, and were worn with stocks or wrapped in a [[necktie|cravat]] tied in various fashions. Pleated frills at the cuffs and front opening went out of fashion by the end of the period.&lt;ref name="Payne_men" /&gt;

Waistcoats were high-waisted, and squared off at the bottom, but came in a broad variety of styles. They were often double-breasted, with wide lapels and stand collars. Around 1805 large lapels that overlapped those of the jacket began to fall out of fashion, as did the 18th century tradition of wearing the coat unbuttoned, and gradually waistcoats became less visible. Shortly before this time waistcoats were commonly vertically striped but by 1810 plain white waistcoats were increasingly fashionable, as did horizontally striped waistcoats. High-collared waistcoats were fashionable until 1815, then collars were gradually lowered as the shawl collar came into use toward the end of this period.&lt;ref name="Payne_men" /&gt;

Overcoats or ''greatcoats'' were fashionable, often with contrasting collars of fur or velvet. The ''garrick'', sometimes called a coachman's coat, was a particularly popular style, and had between three and five short caplets attached to the collar.&lt;ref name="Payne_men" /&gt;

[[Boots]], typically [[Hessian boot]]s with heart-shaped tops and [[tassel]]s were mainstay in men's footwear. After the Duke of Wellington defeated Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, [[Wellington boot]]s, as they were known, became the rage; tops were knee-high in front and cut lower in back. The jockey boot, with a turned-down cuff of lighter colored leather, had previously been popular but continued to be worn for riding.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; [[Court shoes]] with elevated heels became popular with the introduction of trousers.

===The rise of the dandy===
The clothes-obsessed [[dandy]] first appeared in the 1790s, both in [[London]] and [[Paris]]. In the [[slang]] of the time, a dandy was differentiated from a [[fop]] in that the dandy's dress was more refined and sober. The dandy prided himself in "natural excellence" and tailoring allowed for exaggeration of the natural figure beneath fashionable outerwear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=Anne|title=The Modernization of Fashion|journal=Design Quarterly|date=Winter 1992|issue= 154|pages=27–33|jstor=4091263|publisher=Walker Art Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In ''High Society: A Social History of the Regency Period, 1788–1830'', Venetia Murray writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Other admirers of dandyism have taken the view that it is a sociological phenomenon, the result of a society in a state of transition or revolt. Barbey d'Aurevilly, one of the leading French dandies at the end of the nineteenth century, explained:

:"Some have imagined that dandyism is primarily a specialisation in the art of dressing oneself with daring and elegance. It is that, but much else as well. It is a state of mind made up of many shades, a state of mind produced in old and civilised societies where gaiety has become infrequent or where conventions rule at the price of their subject's boredom...it is the direct result of the endless warfare between respectability and boredom."

In Regency London dandyism was a revolt against a different kind of tradition, an expression of distaste for the extravagance and ostentation of the previous generation, and of sympathy with the new mood of democracy.&lt;ref name="Murray 1998"&gt;Murray 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Beau Brummell]] set the fashion for dandyism in [[United Kingdom|British]] society from the mid-1790s, which was characterized by immaculate personal cleanliness, immaculate linen [[shirt]]s with high collars, perfectly tied cravats, and exquisitely tailored plain dark coats&lt;ref name="Payne_men" /&gt; (contrasting in many respects with the [[Maccaroni (fashion)|"maccaroni"]] of the earlier 18th century).

Brummell abandoned his [[Wig (hair)|wig]] and cut his [[hair]] short in a Roman fashion dubbed ''à la Brutus'', echoing the fashion for all things classical seen in women's wear of this period. He also led the move from breeches to snugly tailored pantaloons or trousers, often light-colored for day and dark for evening, based on working-class clothing adopted by all classes in France in the wake of the [[Revolution]]. In fact, Brummel's reputation for taste and refinement was such that, fifty years after his death, [[Max Beerbohm]], wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In certain congruities of dark cloth, in the rigid perfection of his linen, in the symmetry of his glove with his hand, lay the secret of Mr Brummell's miracles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not every male aspiring to attain Brummel's sense of elegance and style succeeded, however, and these dandies were subject to caricature and ridicule. Venetia Murray quotes an excerpt from ''Diary of an Exquisite'', from ''The Hermit in London'', 1819:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Took four hours to dress; and then it rained; ordered the tilbury and my umbrella, and drove to the fives' court; next to my tailors; put him off after two years tick; no bad fellow that Weston...broke three stay-laces and a buckle, tore the quarter of a pair of shoes, made so thin by O'Shaughnessy, in [[St. James's Street]], that they were light as brown paper; what a pity they were lined with pink satin, and were quite the go; put on a pair of Hoby's; over-did it in perfuming my handkerchief, and had to recommence ''de novo''; could not please myself in tying my [[cravat]]; lost three quarters of an hour by that, tore two pairs of kid gloves in putting them hastily on; was obliged to go gently to work with the third; lost another quarter of an hour by this; drove off furiously in my chariot but had to return for my splendid [[Decorative boxes|snuff-box]], as I knew that I should eclipse the circle by it.&lt;ref name="Murray 1998" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hairstyles and headgear===
During this period, younger men of fashion began to wear their hair in short curls, often with long sideburns. In 1795, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]]'s [[hair powder tax]] effectively ended the fashion for wigs and powder, and new styles like the Brutus and the [[Eponymous hairstyle#Men|Bedford Crop]] became fashionable. Older men, military officers, and those in conservative professions such as lawyers, judges, physicians, and servants retained their [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] and powder. Formal court dress also still required powdered hair.

[[Tricorne]] and [[bicorne]] hats were still worn, but the most fashionable hat was tall and slightly conical; this would evolve into the [[top hat]] and reign as the only hat for formal occasions for the next century.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival of Directoire/Empire/Regency fashions==
During the first half of the Victorian era, there was a more or less negative view of women's styles of the 1795–1820 period. Some people would have felt slightly uncomfortable to be reminded that their mothers or grandmothers had once promenaded about in such styles (which could be considered indecent according to Victorian norms), and many would have found it somewhat difficult to really empathize with (or take seriously) the struggles of a heroine of art or literature if they were being constantly reminded that she was wearing such clothes. For such reasons, some Victorian [[history painting]]s of the Napoleonic wars intentionally avoided depicting accurate women's styles (see example below), [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]]'s illustrations to his book ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' depicted the women of the 1810s wearing [[1830s and 1840s in fashion|1840s fashions]], and in [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s 1849 novel ''[[Shirley (novel)|Shirley]]'' (set in 1811–1812) neo-Grecian fashions are anachronistically relocated to an earlier generation.

Later in the Victorian period, the Regency seemed to retreat to an unthreateningly remote historical distance, and [[Kate Greenaway]] and the [[Artistic Dress movement]] selectively revived elements of early 19th century fashions. During the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, many genre paintings, sentimental valentines, etc. contained loose depictions of 1795–1820 styles (then considered to be quaint relics of a bygone era). In the late 1960s / early 1970s, there was a limited fashion revival of the [[Empire silhouette]].

In recent years, 1795–1820 fashions are most strongly associated with [[Jane Austen]]'s writings, due to the various movie adaptations of her novels. There are also some Regency fashion "urban myths", such as that women dampened their gowns to make them appear even more diaphanous (something which was certainly not practiced by the vast majority of women of the period).

'''''1805, Cuirassiers Before the Charge''''' (French - ''1805, Les Cuirassiers avant la charge'', ''Cuirassiers of 1805, before battle'' or ''1805'') is an 1878 painting by [[Ernest Meissonier]], showing a column of [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] [[cuirassier]]s in the uniform of the [[12th Cuirassier Regiment (France)|12th Cuirassier Regiment]] before making a cavalry charge. Artillery are shown taking up position in the right background, whilst on a hill in the far distance (between the second and third NCO from the right) can be seen [[Napoleon]] and his chief of staff.

First exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle]] of 1878 in Paris, it was bought for 275000 francs by the Belgian collector [[Prosper Crabbe]]. It then passed into the collection of [[Ernest Secrétan]] and was lot 39 in the sale of that collection in 1889, from which it was bought for 199652 francs by [[Henri d'Orleans, duke of Aumale]]. The duke kept it in his [[château de Chantilly]] and gave it to the [[Institut de France]] with the rest of his collection - it now forms part of the [[musée Condé]].

'''''Afterimage: The Journal of Media Arts and Cultural Criticism''''' is a bimonthly journal of contemporary art, culture, and politics. It publishes features, essays, local and international reportage, exhibition reviews, and book reviews with an emphasis on [[social dialogue]], politically engaged artistic practices, and the role of the artist as [[cultural critic]] and [[curator]].

The journal is published by the [[Visual Studies Workshop]], a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]], [[artist-run space|artist-run]], education center for [[photography]] and other [[media arts]] based in [[Rochester, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Abrash|title=Mediating History: The Map Guide to Independent Video by and About African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino, and Native American People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F90TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127|accessdate=February 28, 2016|date=August 1, 1992|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-0620-6|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Afterimage'' was founded in 1972 by photographer and curator [[Nathan Lyons]], who had previously served as assistant director and chief curator of the international museum of photography known as [[George Eastman House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Art, Activism, and Oppositionality: Essays from Afterimage |last=Kester |first=Grant H. |year=1998 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, North Carolina |isbn=978-0-8223-2081-4 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eu5cm9iuewC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its inaugural issue, the magazine aimed to pose "a challenge to existing centres of practice and education" as well as "to [[institutional hierarchy|institutional hierarchies]], widening the remit of art criticism and theoretical debate and engaging directly with context, community and issues of [[accountability]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=April 5, 2012|url=http://www.variant.org.uk/8texts/Ann_Vance.html|title= Review of Art Activism and Oppositionality: Essays From Afterimage|work=Variant|publisher=Variant |first=Ann  |last=Vance |date=Summer 1999|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former ''Afterimage'' editor Grant H. Kester described the ethos of the magazine in terms of two primary modes of resistance:

* "an attempt to contest the then dominant tendency to view art photography as a form of pure expression that must remain uncontaminated by more mundane or quotidian uses of the medium"&lt;ref name=artc&gt;{{cite book |title=Art, Activism, and Oppositionality: Essays from Afterimage |last=Kester |first=Grant H. |year=1998 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, North Carolina |isbn=978-0-8223-2081-4 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eu5cm9iuewC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "a desire to break down the division between the practicing artist and the historian or critic, resulting in new hybrid figures such as the 'artist/curator' or the 'artist/critic'"&lt;ref name=artc/&gt;

==Contributors==
The journal's list of contributors has included notable artists such as [[Coco Fusco]] and [[Martha Rosler]].

'''Antoine-Félix Bouré''' (8 July 1831 – 8 April 1883&lt;ref&gt;Edmond Marchal, ''La sculpture et les chefs-d'œuvre de l'orfèvrerie belges'' (Brussels, 1895), p. 696. Information in this article not otherwise cited comes from Marchal.&lt;/ref&gt;), known in his own time as '''Félix Bouré''' but sometimes found in modern scholarship as '''Antoine Bouré''',&lt;ref&gt;Bouré signed himself as ''Ant. Félix Bouré'' on at least two of his works, ''L'enfant au lézard'' and the pair of lions known as ''Totor et Tutur''. The critic [[Camille Lemonnier]], who knew him  personally through the [[Société Libre des Beaux-Arts]], calls him "Félix Bouré."&lt;/ref&gt; was a Belgian sculptor, best known for his [[monumental sculpture|monumental]] lions.

==Life and career==
Bouré was born in [[Brussels]] as the [[Belgian Revolution|Belgian war of independence]] was drawing to a close. He studied locally first under [[Guillaume Geefs]]&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Wauters, ''Catalogue illustré de l'Exposition rétrospective de l'art belge organisée par la Societé Royale des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles'' (Brussels, 1905), p. 11; Marchal, p. 687.&lt;/ref&gt; and then from 1846 to 1852&lt;ref&gt;Arto Dictionnaire, "Bouré, Antoine-Félix," [http://www.arto.be/CONTENT/FR/02_LEXICON/01_LEXICON_DETAIL.cfm?LETTER=B&amp;LEX=919 biography.]&lt;/ref&gt; under [[Eugène Simonis]] at the [[Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts|Royal Academy for Fine Art]], going abroad to complete his training at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Academy of Fine Arts at Florence]]. In his studies, he followed the same course as his older brother, [[Paul Bouré]]. Paul died in his mid-twenties when Antoine-Félix was only 17.&lt;ref&gt;Marchal, pp. 696.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouré was among the artists whose work was exhibited at the Musée Bovie, a ''grand maison'' built by the painter [[Virginie Bovie]] on the Rue de Trône, Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;Anne-Marie ten Bokum, ''Art&amp;fact: Revue des historiens de l'art, des archéologues, des musicologues et des orientalistes de l'Université de Liège'' 24 (2005), [http://www.artfact.ulg.ac.be/revue/be/ten_bokum/index.html retrieved] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132307/http://www.artfact.ulg.ac.be/revue/be/ten_bokum/index.html |date=6 July 2011 }} 25 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868, he was one of sixteen co-founders of the [[Société Libre des Beaux-Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;Arto Dictionnaire, "Bouré, Antoine-Félix," [http://www.arto.be/CONTENT/FR/02_LEXICON/01_LEXICON_DETAIL.cfm?LETTER=B&amp;LEX=919 biography.]&lt;/ref&gt; an [[avant-garde]] society that provided exhibition space alternative to that of the official Salon in Belgium. The [[manifesto]] of the society espoused the [[Realism (visual arts)|Realist]] principle of "free and individual interpretation of nature" along with [[avant-garde|avant-gardist]] ideals of "struggle, change, freedom, progress, originality and tolerance" that were inspired by [[Courbet]] and [[Baudelaire]]. "Modernity" and "sincerity" were keywords. By 1875 the Salon had come to accept and then coopt the Realist program, at which time the society disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Kaplan, entry on "Société Libre des Beaux Arts," ''The Grove Dictionary of Art: From Renaissance to Impressionism'' (St. Martin's Press, 2000), p. 343 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6BIXXNwEOv8C&amp;pg=PA343&amp;dq=%22Société+libre+des+Beaux-Arts%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pIRNTNaAGI2EnQegkeXYCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online]; Arto, Aperçus historiques, "La Société Libre des Beaux-Arts," [http://www.arto.be/CONTENT/FR/01_HISTORIEK/02_HISTORIEK.cfm?VER=85 retrieved] 25 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouré was a friend of [[Auguste Rodin]], who worked on a number of projects in Brussels throughout the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Verbraeken, "Histoire de la sculpture en Belgique," [http://fr.artquid.com/page/65/histoire-de-la-sculpture-en-belgique.html  ArtQuid.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, Bouré was one of two Belgian sculptors who offered testimony on behalf of the 36-year-old Rodin during a controversy over ''The Vanquished'', a life-sized male nude modeled after a Belgian soldier that was later retitled ''[[The Age of Bronze]]''. Rodin had been accused of assembling the work from [[plaster cast]]s rather than modeling it from life; Bouré confirmed Rodin's work methods from his own observations in the studio.&lt;ref&gt;The Rodin-Web, in cooperation with the [[Musée Rodin]], Rodin Nude Photo Project, "Rodin Works: The Age of Bronze (''The Conquered One, The Vanquished''), [http://www.rodin-web.org/works/1875_age_bronze.htm  retrieved] 23 July 2010; Catherine Lampert, ''Rodin: Sculpture and Drawings'' (Yale University Press, 1987), p. 22 [https://books.google.com/books?id=fky-j_RgN2EC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Félix+Bouré+Louvre&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Yb1eTJrzJcH-8Aa59dW3DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Bouré&amp;f=false online.] Lampert describes Bouré's efforts as "letters of support." The other Belgian sculptor was [[Gustave Biot]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouré's reputation rests primarily on his large sculptural lions, characterized by their athletic musculature and majestic air.&lt;ref&gt;Marchal, p. 696.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of these is the colossal lion that sits atop the [[Gileppe Dam]] "like a cat on a garden wall."&lt;ref&gt;Adolph Kemna, "Purification of Water for Domestic Use: European Practice," ''Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers'' 54 (1905), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gileppe lion stands 13.5 meters tall (around 44 feet).&lt;ref&gt;According to the [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Barrage_de_la_Gileppe_805.jpg  information sign] at the dam and most other sources. Its height is sometimes given as 43 feet in Anglophone sources; see for instance General Commissariat of Belgium, ''Belgium, Its Institutions, Industries and Commerce'' (Brussels, 1904), p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; Weighing 130 [[tonne]]s, it was constructed from 183 blocks of sandstone brought to the site by horse-drawn carts.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Stéphany, ''La Belgique en cent coups d'oeil'' (Éditions Racine, 2006), p. 202. Marchal, p. 696, notes 243 blocks, but the informational sign at the dam confirms Stéphany's figure of 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouré also sculpted the colossal lion [[Bronze sculpture|in bronzed zinc]] at the Leopold Gate in Brussels; the pair at the entrance to the ''Palais de Justice'' in [[Charleroi]], known as ''Totor et Tutur''; and other lions throughout Brussels, including those in the garden of the [[Palace of Academies|Palais des Académies]] and four along the [[Rue Royale, Brussels|Rue Royale]]. Some of his lions were produced in tabletop versions.&lt;ref&gt;Glerum auctioneers listed an example of a 45cm tabletop [http://www.glerum.nl/cms2/kavels/263_115.jpg lion] ([http://www.glerum.nl/catalogus.php?pagina_nummer=5&amp;id=6&amp;lang=nl retrieved] 23 August 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouré's interest in leonine subject matter places him in company with ''[[Animalier|les animaliers]]'', the 19th-century French sculptors led by [[Antoine-Louis Barye]] who made animals the focus of their work rather than relegating them to the background.&lt;ref&gt;National Museum of Wildlife Art artist biography, [http://www.wildlifeart.org/artists/artistDetails/index.php?aID=362 retrieved] 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the sculptor [[Léon Mignon]] (1847–1898) and [[Jacques de Lalaing (artist)|Jacques de Lalaing]] (1858–1917), Bouré helped establish a distinctively Belgian tradition of animal art, to which the flourishing [[Antwerp Zoo]] contributed inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Verbraeken, [http://fr.artquid.com/page/65/histoire-de-la-sculpture-en-belgique.html  ArtQuid]&lt;/ref&gt;

The other work for which Bouré is most noted shows a strikingly different side of the artist. The white marble ''Le lézard'' or ''L'enfant au lezard'', not quite 4 feet long and about 2 feet high (overall 61.5 by 118.5 by 39&amp;nbsp;cm), depicts a nude boy lying on his stomach, ankles crossed, resting on his left elbow with his right hand cocked inquisitively as he directs his absorbed gaze down at a small lizard. Bouré created this ''délicieux morceau''&lt;ref&gt;Jules Dujardin, ''L'art flamand: Les artistes contemporains'' (Brussels, 1900), p. 2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=O9ADAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22Antoine-Félix+Bouré%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=841ITO7cA8H98AbJhLWRDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Antoine-Félix%20Bouré%22&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; during the period 1872–1874.&lt;ref&gt;Description of ''Le Lézard'', Fabritius Catalogue of the Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique; the image may be viewed [http://www.fine-arts-museum.be/fabritiusweb/FullBB.csp?WebAction=ShowFullBB&amp;RequestId=187878_2&amp;Profile=Default&amp;OpacLanguage=fre&amp;NumberToRetrieve=10&amp;StartValue=1&amp;WebPageNr=1&amp;SearchTerm1=BOUREANTOINE%20FELIX%20.2.3175&amp;SearchT1=&amp;Index1=Index18&amp;SearchMethod=Find_1&amp;ItemNr=1 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was praised for its fine modeling&lt;ref&gt;Louis Gonse, ''Exposition universelle de 1878: Les Beaux-arts et les arts décoratifs'' (Paris, 1879), vol. 1, p. 71 [https://books.google.com/books?id=LbVXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA354-IA2&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Louis+Gonse%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EUVcTOeDNsL68AanwJyGAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Bouré&amp;f=false online]; review of the same exposition, William W.

(Lemmonier), "Correspondance," ''La Chronique des arts'', p. 128. ''Souple'' ("supple") is a recurring term of praise for the work, found also in Marchal and even de Hauranne (see following), in whom the work otherwise excited no great admiration.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le lézard'' was not uniformly admired. One critic noted its "poverty of imagination" and thinness of execution, while admitting other qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Duvergier de Hauranne, "Le Salon de 1874," ''Revue des deux mondes'' 3 (1874), p. 694 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9ocNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA694&amp;dq=Bouré+lézard&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0mVKTOfEPM__nAezyqTjDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBDhk#v=onepage&amp;q=Bouré%20lézard&amp;f=false  online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bouré's child recalls in some aspects the [[Apollo Sauroctonos]] ("Apollo the Lizard-Slayer"), an often-reproduced figure in [[classical antiquity]] of the pubescent god observing a lizard as it climbs up a tree. The original bronze was attributed to the Athenian sculptor [[Praxiteles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (''Natural History'' 34.69–70) says the original was a bronze by [[Praxiteles]]: "he made a pubescent Apollo sneaking up with an arrow for hand-to-hand combat with a lizard as it crawls from below, which they call ''Sauroctonos''" (''fecit et puberem Apollinem subrepenti lacertae comminus sagitta insidiantem, quem sauroctonon vocant''); the 1st-century poet [[Martial]] alludes to the statue type in the couplet ''Sauroctonos Corinthius'' ("Corinthian Lizard-Slayer," ''Epigrams'' 14.172): "Spare the lizard creeping toward you, sneaky boy: she desires to perish on your fingers":&lt;br&gt;
:''Ad te reptanti, puer insidiose, lacertae
::''Parce: cupit digitis illa perire tuis''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Louvre]] acquired a white marble version in 1807. The sculpture received attention in French-language books on art published while Bouré was active, including [[Émile Gebhart]]'s ''Praxitèle'' (1864) and [[Wilhelm Fröhner]]'s ''Notice de la sculpture antique du Musée Impérial du Louvre'' (1878). If an image of the ''Sauroctonos'' is rotated and flipped horizontally, the compositional resemblances with Bouré's ''L'enfant au lézard'' become more evident. The Apollo's overall height of nearly 5 feet, which includes the tree trunk extending past the body, gives the figure a vertical proportion comparable to that of Bouré's 4-foot horizontal boy.&lt;ref&gt;Louvre Atlas database, [http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=20235&amp;langue=en Apollo Sauroctonos.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Louvre acquired its Apollo Sauroctonos as part of the [[Borghese Collection]],&lt;ref&gt;Louvre Atlas database, [http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=20235 Apollon Sauroctone.]&lt;/ref&gt; which included other pieces that may have influenced Bouré such as a boyish standing [[Eros (god)|Eros]],&lt;ref&gt;Louvre Atlas database [http://cartelfr.louvre.fr/cartelfr/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=28869&amp;langue=fr Jeune garçon en Éros.]&lt;/ref&gt; the so-called [[ephebos|ephebe]] [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]], and a sleeping [[Hermaphroditus]].&lt;ref&gt;Louvre Atlas database, [http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=887 Hermaphrodite endormi.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical iconography, a lizard may also appear with Eros, and the Louvre Eros is thought to have originally held a small creature in its hand.&lt;ref&gt;Based on depictions of [[Eros (god)|Eros]] and [[Dionysus]] with a lizard, some scholars have suggested that the Apollo type preserved by the Louvre example would've been armed with a sort of [[lasso|lariat]] or noose instead of or in addition to a dart; discussion in Jean Sorabella, "Eros and the Lizard: Children, Animals, and Roman Funerary Sculpture," ''Constructions of Childhood in Ancient Greece and Italy'' (American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 2007), pp. 353ff.

(Lemmonier), "Correspondance," ''La Chronique des arts'', p. 128. For Bouré's Roman subject matter, see [[Antoine-Félix Bouré#Historical figures|Historical figures]] below.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the subject matter seems out of keeping with Bouré's monumental and public works, his friend Rodin was also sculpting children during his time in Belgium in the 1870s, when Bouré was a visitor to his studio. Several years later, Rodin produced the bronze ''Les enfants au lézard'' (''Children with a Lizard''), depicting a little girl who retreats to her older sister's arms in fear of the small lizard below. Despite a similarity of subject matter, the work bears little resemblance to Bouré's sinuous reclining figure. Rodin's approach to representing children as "well-fed babies" has been related to his practice in drawing [[cupid]]s ([[Erotes (mythology)|erotes]]) for various two-dimensional media.&lt;ref&gt;Albert E. Elsen, ''Rodin's Art: the Rodin Collection of the Iris &amp; B.

{{distinguish|Art director}}
An '''artistic director''' is the executive of an arts organization, particularly in a theatre or dance company, who handles the organization's artistic direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Actor Prepares|last = Stanislavski|first = Constantin|publisher = Theatre Arts Inc. New York|year = 1936|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Meyerhold the Director|last = Rudnitsky|first = Konstantin, Transl. G. Petrov|publisher = Ardis, Ann Arbor, MI|year = 1981|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Empty Space|last = Brook|first = Peter|publisher = Harmondsworth, UK: Pelican|year = 1972|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally a [[Theatrical producer|producer]] and [[Theatre director|director]], but not in the sense of a [[Business magnate|mogul]], since the organization is generally a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] organization. The artistic director of a [[Theatre|theatre company]] is the individual with the overarching artistic control of the theatre's production choices, directorial choices, and overall artistic vision.  In smaller theatres, the artistic director may be the founder of the theatre and the primary director of its plays.  In larger non-profit theatres (often known in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] as [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theatres]]), the artistic director may be appointed by the [[board of directors]].

==Overview==
The artistic director of a performing arts company is similar to the [[Music director|musical director]] of an orchestra, the primary person responsible for planning a company's season. The artistic director's responsibilities can include (but are not limited to) choosing the [[Play (theatre)|material]] staged in a season, the hiring of creative/production personnel (such as [[theatre director|directors]]), and other theatre management tasks. He or she may also [[Theatre director|direct]] productions for the company. Artistic directors work closely with the general manager of the theatre, and contribute the artistic evaluation of projects and productions to be included in promotional, funding, and press materials. An artistic director also functions as a resource for the directors who are working to mount productions at the theatre and can provide support, counsel, and/or artistic input where requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication in Theatre Directing and Performance from rehearsal to production|last = Lanipekun|first = Jennifer|publisher = Cambria Press, New York|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = Appendix I: Interview with Director 1, Artistic Director of Opera Company 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic director is usually prepared to assume the production should the director become unable to complete his/her duties. Artistic directors are frequently regarded as the artistic representatives of theatre companies and are often required to speak about their theatre to the press.  In the United States, artistic directors often have [[fundraising]] responsibilities as well. 

In some ensemble companies, the artistic director is responsible for recruiting performers to act as a talent pool for the company's productions.  This ensemble may include actors and artists of various disciplines. The artistic director functions as leader of this group, with the aim to create and/or realize various new and established works. 

In [[ballet]], the artistic director is the head of a [[ballet company]]. They have overall responsibility for training the dancers as well as selecting and mounting productions. They are almost always a retired dancer. Often they also [[Choreography|choreograph]] some of the company's productions. 

In some companies, the artistic director may also manage the day-to-day operations of the company, but in many (particularly larger) companies, the artistic director is often exempt from routine administrative duties, freeing him or her to concentrate on the art.  In those cases, decisions about administration, business issues, finances, fundraising, board relations, donor relations, publicity, and marketing devolve to the responsibility of the general manager, chief operating officer, managing director, etc. or are discussed collaboratively.

The '''Association of Comics Magazine Publishers''' ('''ACMP''') was an [[United States|American]] [[industry trade group]] formed in the late 1940s to regulate the content of [[comic books]] in the face of public criticism during that time. It was a precursor to the [[Comics Magazine Association of America]], and the ACMP Publishers Code served as the template for a more detailed set of rules enforced by the CMAA's [[Comics Code Authority]].

== History ==
The ACMP was formed in May 1947&lt;ref name=jimv3&gt;Vassallo, Michael J., "The History of Atlas Horror/Fantasy:  The Comics Code 1955" (introduction), ‘’Marvel Masterworks: Atlas Era Journey into Mystery Vol. 3 ‘’ (Marvel Worldwide, 2010), p. vi (unnumbered)&lt;/ref&gt; and publicly announced on July 1, 1948.&lt;ref name=hajdu128&gt;[[David Hajdu|Hajdu, David]]. ''The Ten-Cent Plague: The Great Comic-Book Scare and How It Changed America'' ([[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]], 2008),  p. 128. {{ISBN|0-374-18767-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-374-18767-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founding members included:
* Phil Keenan, publisher of [[Hillman Periodicals]]
* Leverett Gleason, publisher of [[Lev Gleason Publications]]
* [[Bill Gaines]], publisher of [[EC Comics]]
* Harold Moore, publisher of ''[[Famous Funnies]]''
* [[Rae Herman]], publisher of [[Orbit Publications]]
* Frank Armer, distributor
* Irving Manheimer, distributor&lt;ref name=hajdu128 /&gt;

[[George T. Delacorte, Jr.]], founder of [[Dell Publishing]], which included [[Dell Comics]], served as president,&lt;ref name=jimv3 /&gt; and [[Manhattan]] attorney Henry E. Schultz, president of the board of [[Queens College]] and a member of the [[New York City Board of Higher Education]], as executive director.&lt;ref name=hajdu129&gt;Hajdu, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ComicBookBurningPhoto.jpg|alt=Photo of men and women burning boxes of comics in a bin as a crowd of children watch.|thumb|Comic book burning, c. 1950]]
The ACMP was formed after "accusations from several fronts charged comic books with contributing to the rising rates of [[juvenile delinquency]]",&lt;ref name=jimv3 /&gt; and city and county ordinances had banned some publications&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in August 1948 passed a binding prohibition against the sale of 50 specific comic-book series (Hajdu, p. 106); the [[County of Los Angeles]] on September 23, 1948, outlawed the sale of crime comics to minors (Hajdu, p. 107); and that same year the [[American Municipal Association]] reported that nearly 50 municipalities had "banned the sale of certain comic books". (Hajdu, p. 108)&lt;/ref&gt; though these were effectively overturned with a March 29, 1948, [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling that a 64-year-old [[New York State]] law outlawing publications with "pictures and stories of deeds of bloodshed, lust or crime" was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Hajdu, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the uproar increased upon the publication of two articles:
* "Horror in the Nursery", by [[Judith Crist]], in the March 25, 1948, issue of ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'',&lt;ref name=jimv3 /&gt; based upon the symposium "Psychopathology of Comic Books" held a week earlier&lt;ref name=jimv3 /&gt; by [[psychiatrist]]&lt;ref&gt;Hajdu, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fredric Wertham]]
* "The Comics ... Very Funny!", by Frederic Wertham, in the May 29, 1948, issue of ''[[The Saturday Review of Literature]]''&lt;ref&gt;Hajdu, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spencer, West Virginia]] held a [[book burning|comic-book burning]] on October 26, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Hajdu, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Associated Press]] reported on it, copycat comic-book burnings followed around the country, particularity in [[Catholic]] parishes.&lt;ref&gt;Hajdu, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psu"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coville |first=Jamie |title=Seduction of the Innocents and the Attack on Comic Books: The Comic Book Villain, Dr. Fredric Wertham, M.D. |work=Integrative Arts 10 |publisher=Penn State University |url=http://www.psu.edu/dept/inart10_110/inart10/cmbk4cca.html |date=n.d. |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224091233/http://www.psu.edu/dept/inart10_110/inart10/cmbk4cca.html |archivedate=February 24, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |df= }}. Note: article erroneously refers to Wertham as a "psychologist."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishers Code ==
In 1948, the association released their "Publishers Code," drawing on the Hollywood [[Production Code]] (better known as the "[[Hays Code]]"), which had also been drafted to stave off external regulation. Like the Production Code, it forbid portrayals of crime that might "throw sympathy against the law" or "weaken respect for established authority," and prohibited "ridicule or attack on any religious or racial group." "Sexy, wanton comics" were not to be published, and [[divorce]] was not to be "treated humorously or represented as glamorous or alluring." Comics that complied with the code were offered a "Seal of Approval."

=== ACMP Publishers Code of 1948 ===
#Sexy, wanton comics should not be published. No drawing should show a female indecently or unduly exposed, and in no event more nude than in a bathing suit commonly worn in the United States of America.
#Crime should not be presented in such a way as to throw sympathy against the law and justice or to inspire others with the desire for imitation. No comics shall show the details and methods of a crime committed by a youth. Policemen, judges, Government officials, and respected institutions should not be portrayed as stupid, ineffective, or represented in such a way to weaken respect for established authority.
#No scenes of sadistic torture should be shown.
#Vulgar and obscene language should never be used. Slang should be kept to a minimum and used only when essential to the story.
#Divorce should not be treated humorously or represented as glamorous or alluring.
#Ridicule or attack on any religious or [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] group is never permissible.&lt;ref&gt;Hajdu, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dissolution of the ACMP ==
The code, however, was not a success, ignored by both large and small publishers. Some publishers, such as [[Dell Comics]], refused to join the organization. Others, such as founding member EC Comics, terminated their participation. Those who continued as members made use of the ACMP seal of approval without any formal process of review. Describing the situation in 1954 at the [[Senate subcommittee on juvenile delinquency|Senate comic book hearings]], Director Schultz said: "The association, I would say, is out of business and so is the code."&lt;ref name="senate"&gt;{{cite web|author=83rd United States Congress |author2=Committee on the Judiciary (Harley M. Kilgore, Chairman) |title=Comic Books and Juvenile Delinquency: Interim Report of the Committee on the judiciary pursuant to S. Res. 89 and S.

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Successor organization&lt;!--'Comics Magazine Association of America' redirects here--&gt;==
In 1954, a mounting tide of criticism, including a new book by Wertham — ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' — and congressional hearings, spurred the formation of the ACMP's successor, the '''Comics Magazine Association of America'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''CMAA'''). The ACMP Publishers Code served as the template for a more detailed set of rules enforced by the CMAA's [[Comics Code Authority]].

EC comics and Mad magazine publisher, [[William M. Gaines]], in a 1983 interview with ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' revealed:
{{quote|After the Senate Subcommittee hearings, and this isn’t very well known, but I can prove it again, I sent a letter to every comics publisher, invited them to a meeting and footed the bill for the hall. We took a big place somewhere, and all these people showed up and I tried to convince them that we should form an association and hire the Gleuks of Harvard or anybody else we could find who could do some sort of independent, honest research into whether comic books in truth were the horrendous things that people said they were. And since I really didn’t think they were, I figured, such a study would exonerate us. None of these guys wanted to do that, and right away the whole thing was taken away from me, and they turned it into a situation where they wrote a Code, and the Code forbade the use of the words 'horror,' 'terror,' or 'crime' — this was all my books — and 'weird,' even 'weird,' [laughter] so that would wipe me out. So I didn’t join the association. But then I decided to drop all those books anyway and put out the [[New Direction (comics)|New Direction]] stuff. I put out the six first issues, six bi-monthlies, and they sold 10, 15 percent. You can’t believe how horrendous the sales were. And I later found out that it was because the word was passed by the wholesalers, "Get ‘im!" So they got me.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} }}

'''Bolesławiec pottery''' is the collective term for [[pottery]] produced in [[Bolesławiec]], [[Poland]].
Boleslawiec Pottery is also known collectively as ''Polish pottery'' or ''Polish stoneware''.&lt;ref name=BFT&gt;Beck-Friedman, Tova. "The 40th Symposium for Ceramics and Sculpture, Boleslawiec, 2004." Ceram Tech 21(2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
For centuries one of the premier art forms in [[Central Europe]] has been the pottery and [[ceramic]]s created in the [[Silesia]] region of Poland. The durable and functional creamy white and blue stoneware pieces are unique and easily identifiable. Ceramics and pottery are a definitive part of the identity of the city of [[Bolesławiec]], [[Poland]]. The town itself is often called ''Miasto Ceramiki'' (Town of ceramics).&lt;ref name=PE/&gt; It is impossible to talk about the town without talking about the ceramics that have been produced there for over a thousand years. It is a matter of great pride to the inhabitants.

Ceramic art has long been intertwined with Bolesławiec, a town located in Silesia, a historically disputed region of Europe. The ceramics works are referred to as Boleslawiec pottery, or they are sometimes called by their German name: Bunzlau pottery or Bunzlauer pottery.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, Charles R., and Ilona S. Mack. "The Bunzlau Pottery of Germany and Silesia." The Magazine Antiques July, 1997: pg.88.&lt;/ref&gt; There has recently been a resurgence in the popularity of Boleslawiec ceramic art in the United States.&lt;ref name=BPS&gt;Boleslawiec Polish Stoneware. Polish Art Center. Polish Art Center: Treasury of Polish Heritage. [http://www.polartcenter.com/Boleslawiec_Polish_Pottery_s/4.htm Boleslawiec Pottery]&lt;/ref&gt;

The geography lends itself to ceramic work as the area is rich in natural clay deposits; the clay is still excavated today.&lt;ref&gt;Hildyard, Robin. European Ceramics. Philadelphia: Penn, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The clay is plentiful and of extremely high quality. It has a high feldspar and silicon content, and is classified as stoneware after firing. It is fired at extremely high temperatures, around 1100-1300 degrees Celsius. The clay is brown to grey in color, and rough in texture compared to finer claybodies such as porcelain.&lt;ref&gt;Bentkowska, Anna. "Poland: Ceramics."The Grove Dictionary of Art. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Stoneware is sturdy and vitreous to semi-vitreous and porous when fired. Glaze can be applied and the piece can be re-fired to create a watertight surface. There is also a unique clay slip associated with the Bolesławiec supply base, the application of which results in a glossy, brown surface.&lt;ref name=BFT/&gt;&lt;ref name=PE/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bunzlauer Keramik.jpg|thumb|right|Various types of Bolesławiec stoneware products and ceramics]] 
Ceramics has been a part of Bolesławiec and the entire region’s history for an extremely long time. Potters and ceramic artists are on record from as early as the 14th century, with the first written record of a potter in the municipal books of Świdnica in 1380. However, archaeological digs have shown pottery and ceramics from the early Middle Ages, and trading patterns strongly indicate their presence at such an early time.&lt;ref name=PE&gt;Museum of Ceramics in Boleslawiec. "Permanent Exhibition." [http://www.muzeum.boleslawiec.net/en/site Museum of Ceramics in Boleslawiec], 13 Oct 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KM&gt;Kramer, M.. "White series: Ceramics, birth of an industry at the heart of Europe." The Magazine Antiques July, 2007: p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Potters from the Bolesławiec area first united into a guild around the start of the 17th century.&lt;ref name=PE/&gt; Most of the earliest remaining pieces date from the beginnings of the eighteenth century. They are characterized by the brown glaze and were usually pitchers or jug type vessels. Some of the vessels are lidded forms with attached tin lids, though many are open. They are wheel made and uniform in shape, and were either smooth or bore a diagonal ridge pattern. Most bear a mark of some kind, usually an individual’s initials and a date.

Starting around the middle half of the 18th century the vessels started to become characterized by a natural flowing motif of “sticks”, or a raised design of flowers and leaves on a stem. The sticks were a light white in color, with the surrounding pot usually brown. This added contrast and aesthetic appeal.&lt;ref name=PE/&gt;

Throughout the late 18th century and early 19th century the stick motif was still popular. Other popular motifs included the Boleslawiec emblem, the potter’s emblem of Adam and Eve, heraldic signs, and nature motifs like florals and birds. Pitchers, mugs, and tankards were the most commonly produced works.&lt;ref name=BFT/&gt;&lt;ref name=PE/&gt;

Around the latter half of the 19th century the white clay that had previously been used only for the stick motif started to be used for whole vessels. This was due to the innovation of Johann Gottlieb Altman, a master potter who was the first to cast dishes instead of throwing them on the wheel. Altman also used a new type of lead-free glaze that enabled stamping and allowed for new motifs and designs. Most of the more recognizable designs today, like the repeating circles, scales, flowers, dots, and clovers, were created at that time.&lt;ref name=PE/&gt;

The most famous Pole, who was engaged in the production of ceramics in the regions of Bolesławiec was Stanislaw Wiza.&lt;ref name=SW&gt;History of Stanislaw Wiza [http://www.wholesale-products-poland.com/wiza-polish-pottery History of Stanislaw Wiza]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, he founded the company Ceramika Wiza, which still produces ceramics by traditional methods. Company manages the daughter of Stanislaw Wiza, Lidia Jop, who continues the family tradition.&lt;ref name=CW&gt;The company founded by Stanislaw Wiza - Ceramika Wiza [http://ceramikawiza.com/en Ceramika Wiza]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceramics school==
In 1897 a professional ceramics school was founded in Boleslawiec. The school’s first headmaster was a renowned ceramics master from Berlin, Dr. Wilhelm Pukall. He initiated changes that helped reform technical abilities and new work methods, but also supported innovative new ideas and forms of creative expression. It was a time of great growth for Boleslawiec ceramics. The school accepted mostly sons of local potters, and after their completion went on to start their own workshops.&lt;ref name=PE/&gt;&lt;ref name=KM/&gt;

Three important potters that worked around the turn of the century were Julius Paul, Hugo Reinhold, and Carl Werner. They helped realize the new ideas and vision of the school.  These three artists and their studios started using stenciling techniques, matte glazes, vibrant colors, and gilding. It was their new techniques that revolutionized modern Bolesławiec pottery. In 1936 the school established a cooperative of six schools called the “Bunzlauer Braunzeug”. Their work can still be found today marked by brown pots with white decorations and signed on the bottom.&lt;ref name=PE/&gt;

Although most of Lower Silesia's ceramic workshops and studios were destroyed during World War II, and the entire German population of the town and surrounding province were removed during the transfer of the territory from Germany to Poland in 1945, the new Polish authorities and refugees made a huge effort to revive the work. The cooperative CPLiA was formed and supported by the state-run [[Eugeniusz Geppert Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Wrocław]]. This permitted the cooperative to revive a high standard of artistic achievement and enabled funding and the influence of talented potters in Poland and throughout Europe.&lt;ref name=PE/&gt;

==Bolesławiec pottery today==
[[File:Handgefertigte Keramik.JPG|thumb|Selection of handcrafted products]]

All authentic Bolesławiec pottery has the “Hand made in Poland” stamped on the bottom.&lt;ref name=PE/&gt; The Boleslawiec pottery that is most recognizable today is the white or cream colored ceramic with dark blue, green, yellow, brown, and sometimes red or purple motifs. The most common designs include dots, abstract florals, speckles, “windmills”, and the favorite “peacocks eye”.&lt;ref name=PE/&gt; The traditions of 'Bunzlauer' pottery have been preserved in many locations in present-day Germany by expellees from the former town of Bunzlau, and their descendants. Currently, most of the original pottery that comes from Polish Bolesławiec is produced by the CPLiA cooperative and the many artists that work under it, either in factories or smaller studios. Many of the individual artists do their own work, and there is also a large crafts movement that still produces the traditional heavy brown and white stoneware.&lt;ref name=PE/&gt;

Although Bolesławiec pottery has become more popular in the United States in the past few years, it is still largely a regional product and is known primarily in Germany and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=BPS/&gt; It is collected by private collectors all across the world, and is also part of many museum collections in Europe, the largest collection being in the Museum of Ceramics in Boleslawiec, in Boleslawiec, Poland. However, with the commercialization of the industry, Polish Pottery ceramics are now sold throughout the world for everyday use in the kitchen as well as collectibles.&lt;ref name=PE/&gt;

Bolesławiec pottery was created as a mainly functional product, and still is functional today although the designs have increased in quality and intricacy. It falls in a very different category from fine English and Asian china and pottery that demands high prices in today’s marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Coutts, Howard. The Art of Ceramics: European Ceramics: European Ceramic Design 1500-1830. New Haven: Yale, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, Boleslawiec pottery is not inexpensive. Mugs and cups usually cost anywhere from twenty to forty U.S. dollars, larger more intricate pieces like bowls, teapots, Memory boxes, and specialty plates can cost anywhere from one to two hundred U.S. dollars, and some hand-painted pieces by recognized artists can cost close to five hundred U.S. dollars or more. Price is dependent on size, type of item, quality of glaze/painting, and whether or not the piece is Unikat, or “unique” in English. When a ceramics artist has been deemed accomplished enough they earn the right to create a piece from start to finish and to be able to sign it. These pieces are stamped with UNIKAT on the bottom and are more rare and of better quality and therefore command a higher price.&lt;ref name=BPS/&gt;&lt;ref name=APPC&gt;"The Art of Painting Polish Ceramics" Polish Ceramic Video and Text. 27 Dec 2010 [http://www.adamsimports1.com/Video.html Adams Ceramic Painting] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121201606/http://www.adamsimports1.com/Video.html |date=January 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish Pottery is hand crafted with pride at many small manufacturing companies in Boleslawiec, Poland. All of the pieces are hand painted, using sponge stamp and brushes to paint the art on each piece. All of the patterns are hand-cut by the artists in the sponge and then they use the sponges and brushes to apply the unique pattern to each piece. Sponges are used because they keep the paint wet for a long time, allowing the artist to slowly go around one piece at a time, stamping a unique specific pattern. Several of the artists will create the initial pattern and hand paint a pattern, so all of the artists know what each pattern will be and can keep a similar style to the completed pieces.&lt;ref name=APPC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The History of Polish Pottery" Adams Polish Ceramic Pottery.  27 Dec 2010 [http://www.adamsimports1.com/links/potteryhistory.html Adams Pottery History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122204043/http://www.adamsimports1.com/links/potteryhistory.html |date=January 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Byzantine Museum of Kastoria''' is a [[museum]] in [[Kastoria]] in [[Greece]], dedicated to religious art from the area's late [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and post-Byzantine periods.

== Description ==
The museum stands at the highest point of the city, in Dexamenis Square (''Platia Dexamenis''), next to the Xenia Hotel. It has been open since 1989. It has a collection of some 700 icons from the citys 75 Byzantine and post-Byzantine churches, and almost all of them have been restored and cleaned by the museums conservators. Of this large collection, 35 icons are on permanent display. They date to the 12th to 17th centuries and are divided into six groups on the basis of their age and the [[atelier]] which produced them.&lt;ref name="MOM"&gt;[http://www.museumsofmacedonia.gr/Archaeological_and_Byzantine/Byzantino_Kastorias.html The Museum at ''Museums of Macedonia'' web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important icons are of: Elijah (12th century) in the severe [[Comneni]]an style; St Nicholas (12th century) on a silver ground and surrounded by ten scenes from his life; [[Christ Pantocrator]] (14th century); [[Saints Cosmas and Damian]] (14th century); the ''Panagia Glykofiloussa'' and the Deposition from the Cross (late 14th century); the Man of Sorrows (15th century); an altar door (15th century) bearing a depiction of the [[Annunciation]] and busts of [[David]] and [[Solomon]] at the top; the Annunciation (16th century); the Pantocrator (16th century) painted by a well-known icon-painter named Ioannis Permeniotis; the ''[[Panagia Hodegetria]]'' (16th century); and the Dormition of St Nicholas (16th century). In the semicircular part of the exhibition space are displayed three outstanding works by Kastorian ateliers: an icon of St Paraskevi carrying her own head, and two altar doors with a representation of the Annunciation.&lt;ref name="MOM"/&gt;

Until 1998, the museum ran an educational programme for ten- to seventeen-year-olds titled "In the World of Byzantine Icons", and one of its aims for 2000 is to resume the programme. It involved a guided tour of the museum and a detailed account of the stages of the making of an icon, accompanied by related activities and games.&lt;ref name="MOM"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5509">'''Categories for the Description of Works of Art''' ('''CDWA''') describes the content of art databases by articulating a conceptual framework for describing and accessing information about works of art, architecture, other material culture, groups and collections of works, and related images. The CDWA includes 532 categories and subcategories. A small subset of categories are considered core in that they represent the minimum information necessary to identify and describe a work. The CDWA includes discussions, basic guidelines for cataloging, and examples. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/standards/cdwa/introduction.html CDWA Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The Categories provide a framework to which existing art information systems can be mapped and upon which new systems can be developed. In addition, the discussions in the CDWA identify vocabulary resources and descriptive practices that will make information residing in diverse systems both more compatible and more accessible. 

The use of the CDWA framework will contribute to the integrity and longevity of data and will facilitate its inevitable migration to new systems as informational technology continues to evolve. Above all, it will help to give end-users consistent, reliable access to information, regardless of the system in which it resides. 

These guidelines hopefully provide a common ground for reaching agreement on what information should be included in art information systems, and what information will be shared or exchanged with other institutions or systems. Target users are curators, registrars, researchers, information managers, and systems vendors.

==History==
The CDWA is a product of the Art Information Task Force (AITF), which encouraged dialog between art historians, art information professionals, and information providers so that together they could develop guidelines for describing works of art, architecture, groups of objects, and visual and textual surrogates. 

Formed in the early 1990s, the task force was made up of representatives from the communities that provide and use art information: art historians, museum curators and registrars, visual resource professionals, art librarians, information managers, and technical specialists. The work of the AITF was funded by the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]], with a two-year matching grant from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) to the [[College Art Association]] (CAA).

==CDWA Lite== &lt;!-- [[Lightweight Information Describing Objects]] redirects here --&gt;
[[ARTstor]], the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]], and RLG Programs/[[OCLC]] have worked together to develop an XML schema to describe cultural materials and their surrogates to provide an easier and more sustainable model for contributing to union resources. This initiative was driven by the absence of a data content standard specifically designed for unique cultural works, and a technical format for expressing this data in a machine-readable format.

CDWA Lite is an XML schema to describe core records for works of art and material culture based on CDWA and the Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO) content standard. CDWA Lite records are intended for contribution to union catalogs and other repositories using the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) harvesting protocol. The CDWA Lite schema has been enlarged and integrated into the [[LIDO|Lightweight Information Describing Objects (LIDO)]] schema, which is available on the CIDOC site. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA)|url=https://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/cdwa/introduction.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work of Lochana Dasa or Lochananda Dasa is influenced by the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] ''[[Kadacha]]'' of [[Murari Gupta]]. The complete text is divided into four sections: the ''Sutra Khanda'', the ''Adi Khanda'', the ''Madhya Khanda'' and the ''Shesh Khanda''. As this work was written for the purpose of singing only, it is not further sub-divided into chapters.&lt;ref name=s1&gt;Sen, Sukumar (1991, reprint 2007).

==Contents==

The ''Chaitanya Mangala'' comrpises about 11000 verses. The ''Sutra Khanda'' has around 1800 verses, the ''Adi Khanda'' has about 3300 verses, the ''Madhya Khanda'' consists nearly 4300 verses  and the ''Shesh Khanda'' comprises about 1600 verses. The ''Sutrakhanda'' is a prelude to the [[Krishna]]'s appearance as the [[Gauranga]] [[avatar]] in [[Nabadwip]], which describes the events which led to this incarnation. The ''Adi Khanda'' narrates the early life of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu up to his trip to [[Gaya, India|Gaya]]. The ''Madhya Khanda'' describes events in Mahaprabhu's later life up to his meeting with [[Sarvabahuma Bhattacharya]]. The ''Shesh Khanda'' narrates his pilgrimages to southern and northern India. Some manuscripts also consist a description of the last part of the Mahaprabhu's life till his disappearance.&lt;ref name=s1/&gt;

[[File:01-Kimball Charles Frederick.jpg|thumb|Charles Frederick Kimball]]
'''Charles Frederick Kimball''' (1831 - 1903) was a 19th-century [[United States|American]], pastoral landscape and [[marine painter]], etcher and a master cabinet maker in [[Portland, Maine]].&lt;ref name=ArtFact&gt;[http://www.artfact.com/auction-lot/charles-frederick-kimball-portland-maine-bbi7ixs17v-0-m-5t3mjcchsv Art Fact]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
A native of Maine, Charles Frederick Kimball was born in [[Monmouth, Maine]] on October 31, 1831, the youngest of thirteen children, into a family of architects and builders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askart.com/AskART/artists/biography.aspx?searchtype=BIO&amp;artist=28818 Ask Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He was largely self-taught. He showed local scenery paintings as early as 1853. He along with fellow landscape artist, [[John Bradley Hudson]], Jr., shared a passion for painting [[en plein air]], traveling around [[Casco Bay]] and Portland with their easels and brushes painting local scenery. It was these works that brought him notice. It showed his appreciation for the gentle shifts in the evening light. At this point in this career he was influenced by the [[Hudson River School]].

He studied with Portland artist, [[Charles Octavius Cole]] and [[John Greenleaf Cloudman]]. He was a member of the [[Brush'uns]], a group of artists who went on sketching trips together.

After gaining recognition as a gifted artist, Kimball quit painting professionally in 1863 to work as a stair builder and cabinet maker. He continued to paint as a hobby and his work found a wide regional audience. Despite his growing popularity, he did not want to commercialize his work. When he did sell a piece, it was through a small gallery or frame shop.

After quitting the "professional scene", his style evolved under the influence of the French [[Barbizon school]].

==Marriage==
In 1863 he married Annie Cloudman, daughter of [[John Greenleaf Cloudman]], his mentor.&lt;ref name=ArtFact/&gt; He died in 1903.

==Legacy==
He was an active artist his whole life and a "champion of the arts" in the Portland area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/4aa/4aa39.htm Resource Library Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725050345/http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/4aa/4aa39.htm |date=July 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was dedicated to maintaining the local art scene. In 1882 he played a major role in the founding of the [[Portland Society of Arts]] now the [[Portland Museum of Art]]. He served as its president from 1899 until his death in 1903.

It was he and [[John Calvin Stevens]] who influenced [[Margaret Jane Mussey Sweat]] to leave the [[McLellan House|McLellan House, Portland, Maine]] to the Portland Art Society. The building has since become the society’s permanent home.

In [[physics]] a '''conserved current''' is a current, &lt;math&gt;j^\mu&lt;/math&gt;, that satisfies the [[continuity equation]] &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu j^\mu=0&lt;/math&gt;. The continuity equation represents a conservation law, hence the name.

Indeed, integrating the continuity equation over a volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, large enough to have no net currents through its surface, leads to the conservation law
:&lt;math&gt; {\partial\over\partial t}Q=0\;,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Q=\int_V j^0dV&lt;/math&gt; is the [[charge (physics)|conserved quantity]].

In [[gauge theory|gauge theories]] the gauge fields couple to conserved currents. For example, the [[electromagnetic field]] couples to the [[charge conservation|conserved electric current]].

==Conserved quantities and symmetries==
Conserved current is the flow of the [[canonical conjugate]] of a quantity possessing a [[continuous function|continuous]] [[translational symmetry]].  The [[continuity equation]] for the conserved current is a statement of a ''[[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]''.
Examples of canonical conjugate quantities are:
*[[Time]] and [[energy]] - the continuous translational symmetry of time implies the [[conservation of energy]].
*[[Space]] and [[momentum]] - the continuous translational symmetry of space implies the [[conservation of momentum]]
*Space and [[angular momentum]] - the continuous ''rotational'' symmetry of space implies the [[conservation of angular momentum]]
*[[Wave function]] [[Phase (waves)|phase]] and [[electric charge]] - the continuous phase angle symmetry of the wave function implies the [[Electric charge#Conservation of charge|conservation of electric charge]]

Conserved currents play an extremely important role in [[theoretical physics]], because [[Noether's theorem]] connects the existence of a conserved current to the existence of a [[symmetry]] of some quantity in the system under study. In practical terms, all conserved currents are the [[Noether current]]s, as the existence of a conserved current implies the existence of a symmetry.  Conserved currents play an important role in the theory of [[partial differential equation]]s, as the existence of a conserved current points to the existence of [[constants of motion]], which are required to define a [[foliation]] and thus an [[integrable system]].  The conservation law is expressed as the vanishing of a 4-[[divergence]], where the Noether charge forms the zeroth component of the [[four-current|4-current]].

==Conserved currents in electromagnetism==
The ''conservation of charge'', for example, in the notation of [[Maxwell's equations]],

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \rho} {\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

where:

ρ is the ''free'' electric charge density (in units of C/m³)

'''J''' is the '''current density''':

:'''J''' = &lt;math&gt;  \rho &lt;/math&gt;'''v'''

'''v''' is the velocity of the charges.

The equation would apply equally to masses (or other conserved quantities), where the word ''mass'' is substituted for the words ''electric charge'' above.

'''''Crayons and Paper''''' is a documentary short, featuring Dr. Jerry Ehrlich, a pediatrician who has worked with [[Doctors Without Borders]]. To document the effect of war on children, Dr. Ehrlich has the children draw pictures of their lives. The film features drawings made by children in Sri Lanka and Darfur.

The film is a follow-up to the documentary [[Facing Sudan]].  It premiered at [[The Dam Short Film Festival]] in February 2009 and was broadcast on [[DOC: The Documentary Channel]] until it changed formats.

The film was produced, directed and edited by [[Bruce David Janu]].  The soundtrack was composed by [[Tom Flannery]] and [[Lorne Clarke (singer)]].

'''''Cubist Landscape''''', also referred to as '''''Tree and River''''' and '''''Paysage cubiste''''' or '''''Arbre et fleuve''''', is a [[Cubist]] painting created in 1914 by the French artist, theorist and writer [[Albert Gleizes]]. ''Tree and River'' is one of Gleizes' last pre-World War I landscapes. A comparison with earlier works such as ''[[Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon]]'' (1911), ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)]]'' (1912), ''[[Harvest Threshing]]'' (1912) and ''[[Passy, Bridges of Paris]]'' (1912) demonstrates the artists' continuity with the theme of deep spatial vistas and wide panoramic views, though with a notable diminution of specific references to reality.&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim"&gt;Robbins, Daniel, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, [https://archive.org/details/albertgleizes1881robb ''Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, A Retrospective Exhibition''], 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was reproduced in the German art and literary magazine ''[[Der Sturm]]'' (titled ''Baum und Fluss'') October 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnabg19201005-01.2.4.1&amp;srpos=6&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN-gleizes----# Albert Gleizes, Baum und Fluss, Gemälde, Vierfarbendruck, Der Sturm, 5 October 1920], Princeton University Blue Mountain Project&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Cubist Landscape'' is an oil painting on canvas in horizontal format with dimensions {{convert|97|x|130|cm|in|abbr=on}}, signed and dated ''Alb Gleizes, 14'', lower right. Executed in a Cubist style, the work is notable in its fusing of foreground and background, the multiple perspective—also called [[simultaneity]] or multiplicity,&lt;ref name="MoMA, Meanings and interpretations"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, ''Cubism, Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702090838/http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544|date=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; successive views at various moments in time of the elements—the freely flowing brushstrokes, and the dark lines and arcs delineating juxtaposing color planes or surfaces.

Art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], in his Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum Gleizes Retrospective Exhibition catalogue writes of Gleizes' work during the period:
&lt;blockquote&gt;His work was always directly engaged with environment, especially an unfamiliar one... In the works from 1914 through the end of the New York period, paintings without subject and paintings with an evident visual basis exist side by side, their difference in degree of abstraction hidden by the uniformity with which they were painted and by the constant effort to tie the plastic realization of the painting to a specific, even unique, experience. In the absence of his individual reflexes, these unique references—no matter how neutral—seem less and less in accord with the generalized nature of his austere, flat painting style.&lt;ref name="Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/albertgleizes1881robb Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1914-15, Portrait of an Army Doctor (Portrait d'un médecin militaire), oil on canvas, 119.8 x 95.1 cm, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.jpg|thumb|Albert Gleizes, 1914-15, ''[[Portrait of an Army Doctor|Portrait of an Army Doctor (Portrait d'un médecin militaire)]]'', oil on canvas, 119.8 x 95.1 cm, [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]]]
With regard to structural composition, ''Cubist Landscape'' and other works closely related, are of critical importance, as their rhythms anticipate Gleizes' vital principles of [[Albert Gleizes#Painting and its Laws|translation and rotation]] (tilting planes and circular movements).&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org/form-and-history/poznanski/painting-and-its-laws.html Albert Gleizes, ''Painting and Its Laws'', summary by Peter Brooke]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alibert"&gt;Pierre Alibert, ''Gleizes, Naissance et avenire du cubisme'', Aubin-Visconti, Edition Dumas, Saint-Etienne, October 1982, {{ISBN|2-85529-000-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois"&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''La Peinture et ses lois, Ce qui devait sortir du cubisme'', La Vie des lettres et des arts, 1922-3, 1924 in book form&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhythm and space, for Gleizes, are two vital conditions. Rhythm is a consequence of the continuity of certain phenomena, variable or invariable, following from mathematical relations. Space is a conception of the human psyche that follows from quantitative comparisons. This mechanism, according to Gleizes, is the foundation for artistic expression. It is therefor both a philosophical and scientific synthesis. Cubism was a means to arrive not only at a new mode of expression but above all a new way of thinking. This was, according to art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Alibert (art historian)|fr|Pierre Alibert|lt=Pierre Alibert}}, the foundation of both a new species of painting and an alternative relationship with the world; hence another principle of civilization.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

'''David David-Weill''' (1871-1952) was a French-American banker, chairman of Lazard Frères in Paris, who built an important collection of art.  His collection was plundered by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] during the Second World War and over 2000 items seized. He was a major donor to French and American museums and galleries and a benefactor to universities.

==Early life and family==
David-Weill was born in San Francisco on 30 August 1871.&lt;ref name=dumb&gt;[http://www.doaks.org/resources/bliss-tyler-correspondence/annotations/david-david-weill David David-Weill.] Dumbarton Oaks. Retrieved 10 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Julie (née Cahn) and [[:fr:Alexandre Weill (banquier)]] (1834-1906). His father was a cousin to the three French Jewish brothers who founded [[Lazard Frères &amp; Co.]]. His parents had left France in 1870 because of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and settled in California, where [[Raphael Weill]], a brother of Alexandre Weill lived. They returned to France about 1883. David-Weill continued his education there at the [[Lycée Condorcet]] and the [[École Libre des Sciences Politiques]]. He married Flora Raphael in 1897 and they had seven children, including [[Pierre David-Weill]] and [[Jean David-Weill]].

==Banking career==
Following his education, David-Weill performed his military service and began to work at Lazard Frères, where he rose to become chairman. He became regent of the [[Banque de France]] in 1935.

==Collecting==
David-Weill began to collect from an early age. His acquisitions included paintings, drawings, miniatures, sculpture, furniture, silverware and other items. He became president of the council of French national museums and vice president of the Friends of the Louvre.&lt;ref name=dumb/&gt;

His collection was looted by the Nazis during the Second World War and, according to German records, 2687 items seized.&lt;ref name=Harc&gt;Harclerode, Peter, &amp; Brendan Pittaway. (1999) ''The Lost Masters: The Looting of Europe's Treasurehouses''. London: [[Victor Gollancz]], p. 44. {{ISBN|0575052546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life he donated more than 2000 items to museums and galleries, including the [[Guimet Museum]], the [[Louvre]], and universities at New York, Hamburg, Leiden, Honolulu, and Stockholm. He donated to the libraries of the Museum of Man and the National Institute of Art History, to which he gave the manuscript and journal of [[Eugène Delacroix]]. He gave his Chinese bronzes to the [[Musée Guimet]], and his  [[cloisonné]] objects to the Musée des Arts Décoratifs.&lt;ref name=dumb/&gt;

==Death==
David-Weill died in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] on 7 July 1952.&lt;ref name=dumb/&gt; Parts of his collection were sold in a series of auctions in 1970.

==Honours==
[[File:P1110765 Paris XIV avenue David-Weill rwk.JPG|thumbnail|Avenue David-Weill, Paris.]]
*David-Weill was elected to the [[Académie des beaux-arts]] in 1934.
*Avenue David-Weill in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris]] was named in his honour in 1960 in tribute to his involvement with the [[Cité internationale universitaire de Paris]].

'''''Dead like Me: Life After Death''''' is a 2009 [[Direct-to-video#The direct-to-DVD market|direct-to-video]] film directed by [[Stephen Herek]].&lt;ref name="sfc-mgm"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&amp;id=41125|title = MGM Announces SF DVD Slate|work = Sci Fi Wire|publisher = SciFi.com|date = April 18, 2007|accessdate = April 18, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070420043114/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&amp;id=41125 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is based on the short-lived 2003 television series ''[[Dead Like Me]]'' created by [[Bryan Fuller]].

In the film, the "reapers" have a new boss, Kane, who leads them astray from the rules they followed (mostly) in the TV series. Lead character "George" is fired from her job at "Happy Time" and ends up revealing her identity to her sister, Reggie. George's fellow reapers confront Kane and find that he knows and doesn't care that their departure from the job rules is causing misfortune elsewhere. Unhappy with his leadership, they try various ways to end his existence. George gets her Happy Time job back, and then learns who the new boss of the reapers is.

[[Laura Harris]] was unavailable to return for her role as Daisy Adair, and [[Sarah Wynter]] played the part. The rest of the returning cast was portrayed by the same actors as in the TV series, with new character Cameron Kane played by [[Henry Ian Cusick]].  The film was released on February 17, 2009 after a month-prior debut on Canada's [[Super Channel (Canada)|SuperChannel]].

== Plot ==
A crew of "reapers", whose job is to extract the souls of people who are about to die, find themselves confronted by change as their habitual meeting place (Der Waffle Haus) burns down on the same day that their boss and head reaper ([[Rube John Sofer|Rube]]) disappears (having "gotten his lights"). They soon meet their new boss, Cameron Kane ([[Henry Ian Cusick]]), a slick businessman who died falling from the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]]. He outfits them with color-coordinated [[Palm Treo|smartphone]]s and treats them to luxurious accommodations – teaching them, as [[List of Dead Like Me characters#Roxy Harvey|Roxy]] ([[Jasmine Guy]]) puts it later, that "nothing we do here matters." This tutelage leads the reapers to perform such misdeeds as saving those they were to Reap (Roxy), abusing immortality for financial gain ([[List of Dead Like Me characters#Mason|Mason]], played by [[Callum Blue]]), letting a soul wander, instead of showing him "his lights" ([[List of Dead Like Me characters#Daisy Adair|Daisy]], now played by [[Sarah Wynter]]), and otherwise selfishly focusing on their wants.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite video | people = Herek, Stephen (Director) | title = Dead Like Me: Life After Death  | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1079444/ | medium = DVD | publisher = Metro Goldwyn Mayer | location = Montréal, Québec, Canada |date = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of Dead Like Me characters#George Lass|Georgia "George" Lass]] ([[Ellen Muth]]), the movie's narrator, is fired from Happy Time (a [[temporary work|temp agency]]) after she loudly chews out an employee for delivering a report late. The employee quits and later sues for harassment. George ends up revealing her identity to her sister [[List of Dead Like Me characters#Reggie Lass|Reggie]] ([[Britt McKillip]]). George finds herself reminiscing with Reggie, helping her prepare for the death of her boyfriend Hudson ([[Jordan Hudyma]]).&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;

Her fellow reapers confront Kane and learned that he had realized (and didn't care) that the "pebbles" of their misdeeds would cause "waves" of misfortune elsewhere. Unhappy with his style of management, they find themselves trying to figure out how exactly a fellow reaper can be killed as they shoot, drown, and finally dismember and cremate Kane.

The reapers walk away from the launch, wondering who their new boss is; the movie closes with George who finds herself suddenly showered with [[Post-it note|Post-Its]] falling from the sky, like the Post-Its their former leader Rube had used to deliver their reaping assignments. Realizing she's been selected as the group's new leader, she says "I am so fucked" as the camera pulls away from the Earth into orbit.&lt;ref name="film"/&gt;

[[File:DeathBeNotProud.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Harper &amp; Brothers]])]]
'''''Death Be Not Proud''''' is a 1949 memoir by American author [[John Gunther]], taking its name from [[s:Death be not proud|Holy Sonnet X]] by [[John Donne]].  The story was portrayed in a 1975 TV movie starring [[Robby Benson]] as Johnny Gunther and [[Arthur Hill (actor)|Arthur Hill]] as John Gunther.

==Story== 
In the book, Gunther records the true story of his teenage son's struggle to overcome a [[brain tumor]], and his ultimate death at 17. The story chronicles the period beginning when [[Johnny Gunther]] experiences the first symptoms of the tumor shortly after he had received a clean bill of health. Johnny's complaint of a stiff neck leads doctors to operate, which leads to the discovery of a tumor the size of an orange in his brain.

The book records, in simple detail, all the events and tensions in the months during which Johnny Gunther fought for his life, and his parents sought to help him through recourse to every medical treatment then known. After his last surgery, it was certain that the tumor was inoperable and had gone deep into his brain.

Both his parents knew the end of his life was near but still had plans for Johnny to spend his summer in the country. Even though no doctor gave him a chance of overcoming the tumor, Johnny was never told that he was dying

In the end, his death came quickly, as a result of the tumor rupturing a blood vessel in his brain. He died in a hospital, his parents at his side, at the age of 17, "like a thief death took him," his father writes. Johnny is described in his coffin movingly: "all that is left of a life!"

==Reception==
Partly because of its stark honesty about the pain that the effects of the struggle on family at a time that cancer was a taboo subject, which was rarely talked about, and partly because of its refreshingly revealing portrait of a brilliant young man, who had discovered a new way to liquefy [[ammonia]], who was struck down too young by incurable illness, ''Death Be Not Proud'' became a best-selling book that is still popular today. The story was eventually made into a [[television movie]] in 1975, starring [[Robby Benson]] as Johnny Gunther, and [[Arthur Hill (actor)|Arthur Hill]] as his father.

==People==
Johnny is an example of a truly valiant person. He is selfless in his hope that he will not cause too much pain for others. In Johnny's last few weeks on earth, he still hungers for knowledge. He does not give up because of his illness. He still has hopes and dreams intact.

His parents are also notable for the remarkable degree of communication and care they managed to share with each other and their son when his diagnosis was confirmed, and on to the end of his life. Although by the time of his diagnosis they had divorced and were living separately, they transcended distance, time, and whatever history had led them to separate in order to discuss carefully and kindly the options, care, and ongoing prognosis for his life. 

Frances Gunther, his mother, takes care to have conversations with him about the ultimate issues of life and suffering as addressed in many cultures worldwide, making spiritual writings accessible to him and impressing on him the value of his thoughts and the effect of his actions on others. 

Johnny's character is inspirational to not only his parents, but his caregivers as well, who employ sometimes radical treatments to try and save his life.  Among them are Canadian neurosurgeon [[Wilder Penfield]] and [[Max Gerson|Dr. Max Gerson]], whose "Gerson diet" was used.

Wilder Penfield wrote a letter to his family after his death saying, "for such there must be an immortality which we who tinker at the body may guess at but not understand." &lt;ref&gt;''Wall Street Journal'' 01/26/08: W8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
''Death Be Not Proud'' takes place in part in contemporary New York City, in the [[Neurological Institute of New York|Neurological Institute]], and at the [[Deerfield Academy]] where Johnny was a student, and at his mother's home in [[Connecticut]]. The Neurological institute rises tall above the [[Hudson River]] and the [[George Washington Bridge]]. Johnny Gunther, a cancer patient, stays in this hospital, on and off, during the last three years of his life. He also stays at the Gerson facility for a time. The family moves him to his mother's home in Connecticut when he is able, he visits his school briefly, to graduate with his class, then dies two weeks later.

==Theme(s)==
The main theme of this book is how death and illness affect people, and how courage and a commitment to live fully in the face of daily discouragement and frequent setbacks transform such a life, however brief. During the fifteen months that Johnny had cancer, while going through many upheavals that most families do not experience, the Gunther family continued to be grateful he was still alive, and to celebrate that life. Although Johnny died at age 17, the Gunthers were grateful that he had survived as long as he had, and had continued to live as vibrantly and as intelligently as possible.

The title of the book, taken from Donne's poem, which ends with a comment on "the death of Death," summarizes this: Death had nothing to be proud of in Johnny's case. His (and his parents') wise, brave choices in living a brief life fully overcame any final destruction of the spirit that a fear of oncoming death might have otherwise wrought.

==John 'Papa' Gunther==
The journalist, John Gunther, was a devoted father. John is the narrator of this heartbreaking story. He explains his beloved son’s battle with a brain tumor. He made sure to be with his son as often as possible, and to talk with him through his trials. John’s personality was quite subtle and he didn’t express his emotions.

==Johnny Gunther==
John Gunther, Jr. (1929&amp;ndash;1947) was an intelligent teenager living a life too soon aimed towards death. During his struggle with a brain tumor, Johnny studied on his own, received tutoring and took his school's proper exams, including college entrance. He did chemical experiments to follow up on ideas he developed even while ill. Though faced with death he continued to follow his dreams. Johnny was loved for his selflessness and his curiosity about life. He is portrayed throughout the memoir as a brilliant young man who tried with all his strength to defeat his brain tumor.

It was directed by [[Roger Coleman (professor)|Roger Coleman]] until 1999 when it was merged into the newly created [[Helen Hamlyn Research Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hhc.rca.ac.uk/archive/hhrc/programmes/designage/index.html|title=DesignAge|publisher=The Helen Hamlyn Research Centre|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AARL&gt;{{cite web|title=Age &amp; Ability Research Lab – History|url=http://www.hhc.rca.ac.uk/290/all/1/history.aspx|publisher=Helen Hamlyn Research Centre|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RaisingOurGame&gt;[http://www.designweek.co.uk/raising-our-game/3012575.article "Raising Our Game"]. ''Design Week''. Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
The programme was the recipient of the [[Queen's Anniversary Prize|Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education]] in 1994 in the category of “the Arts”.&lt;ref name="Queen"/&gt;

==History==
By the early 1990s, it was recognized that older adults, in particular adults over 50, were becoming an increasingly significant portion of the population, while improvements in nutrition and medicine were enabling these older adults to remain active. This demographic shift was thought to be permanent.
However, the fact that the younger population represented a shrinking market and older population a growing one was largely ignored by the design profession. In response to the lack of understanding of these issues and the design community’s lack of understanding of their implications, in 1991 DesignAge was founded to investigate the needs of the older population, to interpret the results of the research in a way relevant to designers and industry, and to develop new methodologies in design and design education in response to this demographic shift.&lt;ref name="RSA1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutDA&gt;{{cite web|title=About DesignAge |url=http://designage.rca.ac.uk/DA/aboutDA.html |publisher=DesignAge |accessdate=23 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000819052351/http://designage.rca.ac.uk/da/aboutDA.html |archivedate=August 19, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DesignAge argued that older adults were [[Social model of disability|“rendered disabled” by]] public spaces and transportation systems that had not been designed for this segment of the population, and therefore design had an influential role to play in shaping the future, in that improvements of the life for older adults, as well as the job market and national economy could be realized if designers, manufacturers, and retailers could shift their attitudes towards aging so as to collaborate to create age-friendly products and services. By pointing out that designing for the aging population was designing for their own aging, effectively reframing aging as an issue of self-interest, DesignAge was able to engage younger designers to design for older people.&lt;ref name=DesignResearchForOurFutureSelves&gt;{{cite web|last=Coleman|first=Roger|title=Design Research for Our Future Selves|url=http://researchonline.rca.ac.uk/404/1/coleman_design_research_for_our_future_selves_1994.pdf|publisher=Royal College of Art|year=1994|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, R.; Clarkson, J.; Dong, H.; Cassim, J. (2007). ''Design for Inclusivity''. Ashgate Publishing Company. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the ways that DesignAge used to engage design students was to hold an annual design competition, called the DesignAge Competition, held between 1992 and 1998, to challenge design students to design for their “future selves.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhc.rca.ac.uk/archive/hhrc/programmes/cp/competition/desage.html "The DesignAge Competition".] The Helen Hamlyn Research Centre. Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

DesignAge also engaged the industry at large by approaching the [[Design Business Association]] (formed in 1986 by the [[Chartered Society of Designers]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csd.org.uk/index.aspx?id=42 "Key Dates in CSD History"]. Chartered Society of Designers. Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;) and suggesting a “product challenge” to their member agencies; these were small-scale&lt;ref&gt;Cassim, Julia (April 2008).

Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; events where they would work with older users to design products on a speculative basis for the aging population.&lt;ref name="RaisingOurGame"/&gt;

In 1999 DesignAge became the Helen Hamlyn Research Centre and extended into the research of Inclusive Design.

==Selected publications==
DesignAge produced a number of publications, including the seminal ''Designing For Our Future Selves'' published in 1993.
Other publications include the “Designing for our future selves” special issue (volume 24, issue 1)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Applied Ergonomics, Volume 24, Issue 1, Pages 2-69 (February 1993)  – sciencedirect.com|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00036870/24/1|publisher=Elsevier B.V.|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the journal ''Applied Ergonomics'' published in 1993; ''Once in a Lifetime: An Evaluation of Lifetime Homes in Hull,'' published in 1995; and ''Working Together, A New Approach To Design,'' published in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19980111033134/http://designage.rca.ac.uk/DA/publications.html DesignAge Publications]. DesignAge. Retrieved 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplishments==
Within three years of its existence DesignAge reported that it was able to raise awareness of the issue within the design profession, in related disciplines including ergonomics, in education, and also among major retailers, manufacturers, and the age lobby.&lt;ref name="DesignResearchForOurFutureSelves"/&gt;

In 1994, DesignAge was awarded the Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education in the category of “the Arts” in recognition of its contribution to the shift in perception towards designing for older adults and for working with corporations to design products for older adults and people incapacitated by illness.&lt;ref name="Queen"/&gt;

==Notable collaborations==

===Design for Ageing Network===
In 1994, DesignAge established a Europe-wide research network on design and aging called the DAN (Design for Ageing Network), funded until 1997 by [[Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities (European Commission)|DG V]] of the European Commission (then the Directorate-General for Employment, Industrial Relations and Social Affairs&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/bepa/european-group-ethics/archive-mandates/mandate-1991-1997/index_en.htm "Mandate 1991–1997"], European Commission. Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;). The network’s goal was to “develop the necessary expertise, know-how and understanding to enable design and industry to respond to the growing population of over-50’s in Europe in appropriate and life-enhancing ways” through the use of “in-depth collaboration with older people” that went “beyond simple measuring and questioning.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19981206174133/http://dan.interact.nl/DAN/INFO/homepop1.html "What is the DAN?"]. Design for Ageing Network. Retrieved 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After DesignAge was subsumed into the Helen Hamlyn Research Centre, DAN continued to exist until early 2004 when it was superseded by the Include Network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhc.rca.ac.uk/archive/hhrc/programmes/designage/DAN/index.html "The Design for Ageing Network"]. The Helen Hamlyn Research Centre. Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presence project===
DesignAge also participated in an EU-funded project called Presence,&lt;ref name="AARL"/&gt; which ran from 1997 to 1999&lt;ref&gt;[http://hookerandkitchen.com/presence/ The Presence Project]. Retrieved 11 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and whose aim was “enhancing activity and presence of older people in communities”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presenceweb.i3net.org/ Presence]. Presence.

==Cases of note==

===Marillion===
The British rock band [[Marillion]] are considered to be one of the first artists to have truly harnessed the power of the [[internet]] as a means of music distribution and direct contact with fans, which began with setting up a website in 1996 and raising $60,000 to help finance a 1997 North American tour.&lt;ref name="Marillion fans to the rescue"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1325340.stm | title= Marillion fans to the rescue | first=Tim |last=Masters | work=BBC News | date=2001-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' music journalist [[Alexis Petridis]] as "the undisputed pioneers" of the fan-funded music model,&lt;ref name="This song was brought to you by ..."&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/18/popandrock.alexispetridis | title= This song was brought to you by ... | work=The Guardian | first=Alexis | last=Petridis | date=18 April 2008 | accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with the distribution of their 2001 release ''[[Anoraknophobia]]''. Amidst a dissolving relationship with their record label and management team, the band calculated that they would need 5,000 fans to order the album to finance the project.  However, they needed the money up-front, before the record was released.  They turned to their mailing list and asked fans to pre-order the album in what was later described by the [[BBC]] as "a unique funding campaign".&lt;ref name="Marillion fans to the rescue"/&gt; Pre-sales well exceeded their 5,000-unit target (reaching about 12,000 pre-sales total).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.music4point5.com/blog/the-marillion-story-and-what-we-can-all-learn-from-it/ The Marillion story and what we can all learn from it - Music 4.5&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109142548/http://www.music4point5.com/blog/the-marillion-story-and-what-we-can-all-learn-from-it/ |date=2012-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marillion have since released several other albums based on a fan-funded model, receiving a £360,000 advance for their 15th studio album ''[[Happiness Is the Road]]''.&lt;ref name="This song was brought to you by ..."/&gt;

===Amanda Palmer===
Unofficially dubbed the "queen" of Kickstarter, [[Amanda Palmer]] is an example of one of the most successful fan-funded music campaigns of all time.  On April 30, 2012, Palmer ran a campaign on Kickstarter, with a goal of $100,000 to fund her newest studio album, ''[[Theatre Is Evil]]''.  By the end of May 2012, Palmer had amassed almost $1.2 million, ultimately receiving donations from nearly 25,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/amandapalmer/amanda-palmer-the-new-record-art-book-and-tour|title=Amanda Palmer: The new RECORD, ART BOOK, and TOUR|work=Kickstarter}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By comparison, the average successful project on Kickstarter at the time raised about $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/arts/music/amanda-palmer-takes-connecting-with-her-fans-to-a-new-level.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ben | last=Sisario | title=Amanda Palmer Takes Connecting With Her Fans to a New Level | date=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ellis Paul===
Boston-based singer/songwriter [[Ellis Paul]] is another important case study in the field of fan-funded music.  His 2010 release, The Day After Everything Changed, was funded completely by fan donations.  Instead of using a traditional crowd-funding platform, he adapted the online merchandise platform [[Nimbit]] to his own fan-funding scheme.  Paul set up a tiered donation hierarchy, ranging from the $15 Street Busker level, up to the $10,000 Woody Guthrie level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ellispaul.com/index.php?page=news&amp;display=2339|title=ELLIS PAUL|date=9 July 2008|work=Ellis Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fans received different perks based on the tier at which they donated.  The project proved to be highly successful, with total donations exceeding $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2009/04/12/lighters_down_checkbooks_up/|title=Musicians and fans join together to get albums made - The Boston Globe|work=boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paul is putting his fan-funding to the test again; he is currently in the midst of fan-funding a new studio album set to release sometime in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellispaul.com/index.php?page=blog&amp;category=&amp;display=5695|title=ELLIS PAUL|date=26 September 2012|work=Ellis Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric Eel Shock===
[[Tokyo]]-based [[garage rock|garage]] [[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Electric Eel Shock]] is another group that has seen some success in the way of fan-funded music. In 2004 they offered a "SAMURAI 100" package, which gave fans the opportunity to secure "guest list for life" status.  The package cost £100 and the band raised £10,000 by selling 100 such packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/news/10764-wanna-go-vip-electric-eel-shock-ll-show-you-the-way|title=Wanna Go VIP? Electric Eel Shock'll show you the way...|work=DrownedInSound}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
As a business practice, fan-funded music is not without its criticism.  Fan-funded music has gained popularity in the past few years however, money raised through these platforms still is only estimated to make up 1% of the amount spent on albums and tours. Many bands start off with fan funding to finance their initial album but then get signed to a record label. Major labels are signing artists with successful fan funded campaigns using the campaigns as a filter before investing in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/jan/21/fan-funded-model-record-deal | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Helienne | last=Lindvall | title=Behind the music: The fan-funded model that led to a major record deal | date=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other, more well-known bands have used fan funding to distance themselves from their label contracts and manage their own music. There has yet to be a band that has used fan funding to fully finance their career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18788054 | work=BBC News | title=How fan-funding is changing the face of music finance | date=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, ''The Guardian'' journalist [[Gareth McLean]] was scathing of Marillion's pioneering efforts to continue their career without a label by dealing directly with their fans on the Internet, writing: "They have, they explained, decided to eschew the machinations of the record industry in order to be closer to the people. (One suspects that their decision occurred round about the time that the record industry decided to shun Marillion)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/aug/13/tvandradio.television1 | title= In the realm of pretences| author=Gareth McLean| date=13 August 2001|work=The Guardian |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that artists overestimate the cost of recording an album and dishonestly solicit more money than they need via fan-funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicthinktank.com/blog/an-argument-against-fan-funding.html|title=An Argument Against Fan Funding - MTT - Music Think Tank|work=musicthinktank.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With advancements in digital technology, recording equipment has become increasingly compact and more affordable. It is no longer a requirement for an artist to need a large recording studio that houses oversized equipment.  This increase in accessibility that the everyday musician has today has made it possible for artists to record their own albums from their homes. Since there are no restrictions for what artists can ask for, it is not unheard of for artists to inflate the expected costs and then keep the extra money as profit.

Critics also point out that the fan-funded music model has turned bands into marketers and sales personnel. Artists must be able to develop personal marketing strategies in order to get the money to even begin working on their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=10&amp;title=the_problem_with_fan_funded_music&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1|title=The Problem With Fan-Funded Music|author=NME.COM|work=nme.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists must put lots of time and effort into creating a campaign that engages their fans and gets them to donate to their project. This can prove difficult for any artist to create a campaign that does not come off as  "[a] shrill and desperate-modern-day pan-handling by entitled go-getters."{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} While fan-funded platforms are accessible for any musician, they have become over-crowded with both artists and anyone with an idea. "For every legitimately exciting pitch there are dozens of musicians, filmmakers and designers pleading for funds to complete ill-conceived projects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443991704577579190431157610|title=The Good, the Bad and the Crowdfunded|author=Erik Sofge|date=18 August 2012|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Running fan-funded campaigns cost bands a large sum of money. They must pay for video production for the video that every campaign has,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} a producer and an engineer to mix and master their album, and fulfill all of the rewards promised to their fans as well as the shipping on them. Often the money made off these projects ends up going to paying the costs of running a successful fan funded campaign. For example, a large portion of the $1 million that [[Amanda Palmer]] raised went into funding her [[Kickstarter]] project itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2012/11/23/165658174/how-much-does-crowdfunding-cost-musicians|title=How Much Does Crowd Funding Cost Musicians?|date=23 November 2012|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists such as Palmer have huge fan bases to appeal to for money, but for the average artist raising that kind of money isn't a reliable method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicclout.com/contents/article-116-why-i-hate-crowd-funding-by-normandie-wilson.aspx|title=Music Clout|work=musicclout.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''letters of Gustave Flaubert''', the 19th-century French novelist, range in date from 1829, when he was 7 or 8 years old, to a day or two before his death in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flaubert.univ-rouen.fr/jet/public/correspondance/feuilletage_liste_elts.php?t=C |title=Présentation des lettres par ordre chronologique |editor1-last=Leclerc |editor1-first=Yvan |editor2-last=Girard |editor2-first=Danielle |date=2 November 2017 |website=Correspondence: Édition électronique |publisher=Centre Flaubert, Université de Rouen |language=French |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are considered one of the finest bodies of letters in French literature, admired even by many who are critical of [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]]'s novels.{{sfn|Barnes|2003}}  His main correspondents include family members, business associates and fellow-writers such as [[Théophile Gautier]], the [[Goncourt brothers]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]], [[George Sand]], [[Ivan Turgenev]] and [[Émile Zola]].  They provide a valuable glimpse of his methods of work and his literary philosophy, as well as documenting his social life, political opinions, and increasing disgust with bourgeois society.

== Correspondents ==

4481 letters by Flaubert survive,{{sfn|Leclerc|Girard|2017}} a number which would have been considerably higher but for a series of burnings of his letters to his friends.

== Themes ==

Flaubert's personality was rigorously excluded from his novels, but in the letters, written at night after the day's literary work was done, he expresses much more spontaneously his own personal views.{{sfn|Steegmuller|1954|p=11}}  Their themes often arise from his life as a reader and writer.  They discuss the subject-matter and structural difficulties of his novels, and explore the problems Flaubert faced in their composition, giving the reader a unique glimpse of his art in the making.{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|p=76}}  They illustrate his extensive reading of the creative literatures of France, England (he loved [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]), Germany and the classical world; also his deep researches into history, philosophy and the sciences.{{sfn|Le Calvez|2001|p=74}}{{sfn|Barnes|2002|p=244}}  Above all, they constantly state and restate Flaubert's belief in the duty of the writer to maintain his independence, and in his own need to reach literary beauty through a quasi-scientific objectivity.{{sfn|Steegmuller|1954|pp=17–18}}{{sfn|Le Calvez|2001|p=75}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hampshire |first=Stuart |author-link=Stuart Hampshire |date=16 December 1982 |title=In Flaubert's Laboratory |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1982/12/16/in-flauberts-laboratory/ |work=The New York Review of Books |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But his letters also demonstrate an enjoyment of the simple pleasures of Flaubert's youth.  Friendship, love, conversation, a delight in foreign travel, the pleasures of the table and of the bed are all in evidence.{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|p=67}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vidal |first1=Gore |author-link1=Gore Vidal |year=1982 |title=Pink Triangle and Yellow Star, and Other Essays (1976–1982) |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xDQgAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22brothels+and+baths+of%22&amp;dq=%22brothels+and+baths+of%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjul5S1l8_cAhXIK8AKHR8tD68Q6AEIQzAF |location=London |publisher=Heinemann |page=29 |isbn=9780434830756 |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These do not disappear in his maturer years, but they are offset by discussions of politics and current affairs which reveal an increasing disgust with society, especially bourgeois society, and with the age he lived in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lloyd |first1=Rosemary |year=2014 |orig-year=1990 |title=Madame Bovary |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0F4tBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22flaubert's+letters%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3jIb9hK3aAhVlKsAKHdNpAMY4FBDoAQg-MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22flaubert's%20letters%22&amp;f=false |location=Abingdon |publisher=Routledge |page=21 |isbn=9781138799349 |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Le Calvez|2001|p=74}}  They exude a sadness and a sense of having grown old before his time.{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|p=80}}  As a whole, said the literary critic Eric Le Calvez, Flaubert's correspondence, "reveals his vision of life and of the relation between life and art: since the human condition is miserable, life can be legitimated only through an eternal pursuit of art."{{sfn|Le Calvez|2001|p=74}}

== Critical reception ==
[[File:Flaubert letter.jpg|thumb|An 1877 letter from [[Gustave Flaubert]] to [[Léon Cladel]]]]

For many years after the first publication of the letters critical opinion was divided.  [[Albert Thibaudet]] thought them "the expression of a first-rate intellect", and [[André Gide]] wrote that "For more than five years his correspondence took the place of the Bible at my bedside.  It was my reservoir of energy".  [[Frank Harris]] said that in his letters "he lets himself go and unconsciously paints himself for us to the life; and this Gustave Flaubert is enormously more interesting than anything in ''Madame Bovary''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Frank |author-link1=Frank Harris |year=1927 |title=Latest Contemporary Portraits |location=New York |publisher=Macaulay |page=206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand [[Marcel Proust]] found Flaubert's epistolary style "even worse" than that of his novels, while for [[Henry James]] the Flaubert of the letters was "impossible as a companion".{{sfn|Steegmuller|1982|pp=xvii–xviii}}

This ambivalence is a thing of the past, and there is now widespread agreement that the Flaubert correspondence is one of the finest in French literature.{{sfn|Le Calvez|2001|p=74}}  Publication of them "has crowned his reputation as the exemplary artist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192806871.001.0001/acref-9780192806871-e-2807?rskey=3k4M21&amp;result=4 |title=The Oxford Companion to English Literature (7 ed.) |date=2009 |editor-last=Birch |editor-first=Dinah |editor-link=Dinah Birch |website=Oxford Reference |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Enid Starkie]] wrote that Flaubert was one of his own greatest literary creations, and that the letters might well be seen in the future as his greatest book, and the one in which "he has most fully distilled his personality and his wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Starkie |first1=Enid |year=1971 |title=Flaubert the Master: A Critical and Biographical Study (1856-1880) |location=London |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |pages=355-356 |isbn=0297002260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], an inveterate enemy of Flaubert's novels, considered the letters a perfect example of pre-Freudian [[Free association (psychology)|free association]], and for [[Julian Barnes]] this description "hints at their fluency, profligacy, range and sexual frankness; to which we should add power, control, wit, emotion and furious intelligence.  The ''Correspondance''&lt;!--He is using the title of the French edition, hence the French spelling--&gt;...has always added up to Flaubert's best biography."{{sfn|Barnes|2002|p=239}}{{sfn|Barnes|2003}}  Rosemary Lloyd analyses the elements of their appeal as being "partly [their] wide sweep, partly the sense of seeing what Baudelaire called the strings and pulleys of the writer's workshop, and partly the immediacy of Flaubert's changeable, complex and challenging personality."  She continues, "Reading Flaubert's correspondence brings startlingly alive a man of enormous complexity, of remarkable appetites and debilitating lethargies, a knotted network of prejudices, insights, blind spots, passions and ambitions."{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|pp=67, 83}}

== Editions ==

* {{cite book |last1=Flaubert |first1=Gustave |year=1887–1893 |title=Correspondance |location=Paris |publisher=G. Charpentier }}  This four-volume edition was the first to try to collect Flaubert's letters.  The unnamed editor was Flaubert's niece Caroline Commanville; she censored the letters freely, cutting out many passages which she thought indecent or which referred unflatteringly to living persons, especially to herself, and very often failing to notify the reader of these cuts by the use of [[Ellipsis|ellipses]].  She also corrected his punctuation and sometimes "improved" his phrasing.{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|p=68}}{{sfn|Steegmuller|1982|pp=xv–xvi}}{{sfn|Barnes|2003}}{{sfn|Cléroux|2013}}

The '''Gruber Collection''' is a collection of books and manuscripts housed at the [[Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois. The collection contain more than 300 books from the 15th to 18th centuries and 14 manuscripts of Greek New Testament (minuscules and lectionaries). Special value have works of [[Martin Luther|Luther]], copies of his letters, original letters written by [[Philipp Melanchthon]], the [[Novum Instrumentum omne|Greek New Testament]] of Erasmus,&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.lstc.edu/gruber/ref_docs/erasmus.php]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101090802/http://collections.lstc.edu/gruber/ref_docs/erasmus.php |date=January 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other documents of [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] era.&lt;ref name=Gruber&gt;[http://collections.lstc.edu/gruber/about.php]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229224117/http://collections.lstc.edu/gruber/about.php |date=December 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
All manuscripts and majority of books were collected by [[L. Franklin Gruber]] (1870–1941), the former president of the [[Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago]] in [[Maywood, Illinois]].&lt;ref name = Gruber/&gt; 
He purchased them in Europe and brought to Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], [[Bart D. Ehrman]], "The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration", ''[[Oxford University Press]]'' (New York - Oxford, 2005), p. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hong Kong Ballet''' (香港芭蕾舞團) is a classical ballet company founded in 1979.

== History ==

The Company was created in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.luxury-insider.com/luxury-news/2009/06/hong-kong-ballet-dances-through-the-galaxy|title=Hong Kong Ballet Dances Through The Galaxy|website=Luxury-insider.com|date=24 June 2009|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997, The Hong Kong Ballet has concluded more than 30 tours to 10 countries in North and South America, Europe and Asia.

In January 2010, Faye Leung, the Company's former top ballerina, revealed in a book that she was sacked from the HK Ballet on suspicious that she was dividing dancers and organizing a strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/article/704083/i-was-sacked-splitting-hk-ballet-dancer-writes|title=I was sacked for splitting HK Ballet, dancer writes|website=Scmp.com|date=19 January 2010|author=Olga Wong|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, the Company took part in Expo 2010 Shanghai, presenting a mixed bill production and performing as part of Festive Hong Kong Celebration.  The Hong Kong Ballet’s dancers also performed at the 4th and 5th International Dance Festivals held in Cali, Colombia; the 50th Anniversary International Gala in Brisbane, Australia; and the International Ballettgala XI in Dortmund, Germany. Most recently, the Company presented ''Firecracker'' in Macau in January 2012. In the summer of 2012, The Hong Kong Ballet toured the United States and Canada with a mixed bill featuring two specially commissioned contemporary ballets. The Company made its debut appearance at [[Jacob’s Pillow]] Dance Festival and then performed in Aspen, Montreal and Santa Fe.

In June 2017, Septime Webre, of Cuban-American origins, previously the artistic director of [[The Washington Ballet]] for 17 years, was named Artistic Director of the Ballet. For 2018, he planned a contemporary program which featured the music of the [[Beatles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hk.asiatatler.com/life/why-septime-webre-believes-the-beatles-and-the-ballet-are-a-perfect-match|title=Why Septime Webre Believes The Beatles And The Ballet Are A Perfect Match|website=Asiatatler.com|date=26 February 2018|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also organized ''Ballet in the City'', outdoors dancing events in different art galleries of the city, and a series of other events "to insert the company and its dancers into the social fabric of the city".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zolimacitymag.com/septime-webre-has-three-years-to-make-ballet-relevant-to-hong-kong-heres-how-hell-do-it/|title=Septime Webre has 3 years to make ballet relevant to Hong Kong: here's how he'll do it|website=Zolimacitymag.com|date=9 November 2017|author=Simon Cartledge|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
=== Repertoire ===

The Company performs a repertoire that combines 19th to 21st century classical, contemporary works and newly commissioned ballets. This repertoire reflects both the heritage and origin of ballet in Europe as well as contemporary influences, and includes commissions focused on Hong Kong’s culture and history, such as ''Firecracker'' by local choreographer Yuri Ng. The Company’s repertoire encompasses full-length ballets such as ''[[Swan Lake]]'', ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' and ''[[Giselle]]'', and the finest classical and neo-classical works of the 20th and the 21st centuries, including [[George Balanchine]]'s ''[[Jewels (ballet)|Rubies]]'' and ''[[Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux]]'';  [[Rudi van Dantzig]]’s ''[[Romeo and Juliet (ballet)|Romeo and Juliet]]''; [[Ronald Hynd]]’s ''[[The Merry Widow (ballet)|The Merry Widow]]'' and ''[[Coppélia]]''; and Wang Xin Pang’s ''Serenade'' and ''Pas de Six from Mozart''. The Company has also performed contemporary ballets such as [[William Forsythe (choreographer)|William Forsythe]]’s ''Steptext'', Nils Christe’s ''Symphony in Three Movements'', [[Stephen Mills]]’s ''Hush'', and [[Stanton Welch]]’s ''Clear''. The Hong Kong Ballet's commissions include [[Natalie Weir]]’s ''Turandot'', and [[Stephen Baynes]]’s ''The Way Alone''.

The '''Hugh Lane Gallery''', officially '''Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane''' and originally the '''Municipal Gallery of Modern Art''', is an [[art gallery]] operated by [[Dublin City Council]] and its subsidiary the Hugh Lane Gallery Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/content/RecreationandCulture/ArtsOffice/HughLane/Documents/FinalCodeofGovernance.pdf|title=Code of Governance|publisher=Hugh Lane Gallery Trust|date=January 2014|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[Charlemont House]] (built 1763) on [[Parnell Square]], [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

The gallery was founded by Sir [[Hugh Lane]] on [[Harcourt Street]] in 1908, and is the first known public gallery of [[modern art]] in the world.{{cn|date=June 2015}} There is no admission fee and the gallery is completely wheelchair-accessible. The gallery was closed for reconstruction in 2004, and reopened in May 2006, with a new extension by Gilroy McMahon Architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gilroymcmahon.com/cultural/projects/dublin-gallery.htm|title=PROJECTS: Cultural - The Hugh Lane Gallery|publisher=Gilroy McMahon Architects|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmp.ie/newbuild/hughlane.html|title=Combining old and new at the Hugh Lane Art Gallery|publisher=Lee McCullough Consulting Engineers|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum has a permanent collection and hosts exhibitions, mostly by contemporary Irish artists. It has a dedicated [[Sean Scully]] room. [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]'s studio was reconstructed in the gallery in 2001 after being dismantled and moved from London starting in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francis-bacon.com/blog/francis-bacons-studio-lecture-at-tokyo-momat/|title=‘Francis Bacon’s Studio’ lecture at Tokyo MOMAT|publisher=Estate of Francis Bacon|date=2013-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/studio-hugh-lane-gallery-dublin/337|title=Francis Bacon's studio, Hugh Lane Gallery, Dublin|author=Paul Tuthill|publisher=Whitehot Magazine|date=April 2007|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the painting ''In The Omnibus'' by [[Honoré Daumier]] was stolen from the gallery, and recovered in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27394001|title=Stolen painting returned to Hugh Lane Gallery|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2014-05-13|accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Isis Unveiled: A Master-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient and Modern Science and Theology''''', published in 1877, is a book of [[esoteric]] [[philosophy]] and [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]]'s first major work and a key text in her [[Theosophical Society|Theosophical movement]]. 

The work has often been criticized as a plagiarized occult work, with scholars noting how Blavatsky extensively copied from a large number of sources popular among occultists at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[James D. Hart|Hart, James D]]; Leininger, Phillip. (1995). ''The Oxford Companion to American Literature''. Oxford University Press. pp. 71-72. {{ISBN|0-19-506548-4}} "After a period of spiritualism in America, Mme Blavatsky with the aid of Colonel Henry S. Olcott founded her Theosophical Society and published ''Isis Unveiled'' (1877), a plagiarized occult work denouncing the spiritualism she had formerly advocated."&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Isis Unveiled'' is nevertheless also understood by modern scholars to be a milestone in the history of [[Western Esotericism]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, K. Paul. (1994). ''The Masters Revealed: Madame Blavatsky and the Myth of the Great White Lodge''. State University of New York Press. pp. xv-x-x, 241-245. "The Western Esoteric Tradition has no more important figures in modern times than Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (1831-1891)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin"&gt;Godwin, Joscelyn. ''The Theosophical Enlightenment'' (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bevir"&gt;Bevir, Mark. ''The West Turns Eastward: Madame Blavatsky and the Transformation of the Occult Tradition''. Journal of the American Academy of Religion. 62.3 (1994), pp. 747-767.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Santucci"&gt;Santucci, James A. ''Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna'', in ''Dictionary of Gnosis &amp; Western Esotericism''. ed. by Wouter J. Hanegraff (Leiden &amp; Boston: Brill, 2006), pp. 177-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The work was originally entitled ''The Veil of Isis'', a title which remains on the heading of each page, but had to be renamed once Blavatsky discovered that this title had already been used for an 1861 [[Rosicrucian]] work by W.W. Reade. ''Isis Unveiled'' is divided into two volumes. Volume I, ''The 'Infallibility' of Modern Science'', discusses occult science and the hidden and unknown forces of nature, exploring such subjects as forces, [[elementals]], [[psychic phenomena]], and the Inner and Outer Man. Volume II, ''Theology'', discusses the similarity of Christian scripture to [[Eastern religions]] such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], the [[Vedas]], and [[Zoroastrianism]]. It follows the [[Renaissance]] notion of ''[[prisca theologia]]'', in that all these religions purportedly descend from a common source; the ancient "Wisdom-Religion".&lt;ref name="Santucci"/&gt; Blavatsky writes in the preface that ''Isis Unveiled'' is "a plea for the recognition of the [[Hermetic philosophy]], the anciently universal Wisdom-Religion, as the only possible key to the Absolute in science and theology."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena P., ''Isis Unveiled: A Master-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient and Modern Science and Theology'' (Pasadena, CA: Theosophical University Press, 1999), vol. I. p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Isis Unveiled'' is argued by many modern scholars such as Bruce F. Campbell and [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] to be a milestone in the history of [[Western Esotericism]].&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas, ''The Western Esoteric Traditions: A Historical Introduction'' (Oxford &amp; New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 215-217.&lt;/ref&gt; Blavatsky gathered a number of themes central to the occult tradition—[[perennial philosophy]], a [[Neo-Platonic]] [[Emanationism|emanationist cosmology]], [[adepts]], [[esoteric Christianity]]—and reinterpreted them in relation to current developments in science and new knowledge of non-Western faiths. In doing so, ''Isis Unveiled'' reflected many contemporary controversies—such as [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theories on [[evolution]] and their impact on religion—and engaged in a discussion that appealed to intelligent individuals interested in religion but alienated from conventional Western forms.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;Campbell, Bruce F. ''Ancient Wisdom Revived: A History of the Theosophical Movement'' (Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 1980), pp. 34-38, 70-74.&lt;/ref&gt; Blavatsky's combination of original insights, backed by scholarly and scientific sources, accomplished a major statement of modern occultism's defiance of materialist science.

In later theosophical works some of the doctrines originally stated in ''Isis Unveiled'' appeared in a significantly altered form,{{refn|group=note|name="conceptual shift in move to india"|This shift in thought is marked by Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society's move eastward to India.&lt;ref name="WEMS"&gt;''Helena Blavatsky: Western Esoteric Masters Series'', ed. by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke (Berkeley, CA: North Atlantic Books, 2004), pp.9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;}} drawing out confusion among readers and even causing some to perceive contradiction.  Specifically, the few and—according to many—ambiguous statements on reincarnation as well as the threefold conception of man as body, soul and spirit of ''Isis Unveiled'' stand in contrast to the elaborate and definite conception of reincarnation as well as the sevenfold conception of man in ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888).  Blavatsky later asserted the correctness of her statements on reincarnation and the constitution of man in ''Isis Unveiled'', attributing the resulting confusion and alleged contradictions to the more superficial or simplified conceptions of the ideas in ''Isis Unveiled'' compared to those of later works.{{refn|group=note|name="HPBs elaboration on reincarnation in IU"|In the article ''Theories about Reincarnation and Spirits'' Blavatsky elaborately addressed the confusion related to the statements on reincarnation of ''Isis Unveiled'', stating in particular that: "[… T]he doctrine [of reincarnation] is maintained now as it was then.  Moreover, there is no 'discrepancy' but only incompleteness — hence, misconceptions arising from later teachings.".&lt;ref name=trs&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blavatsky|first=H.P.|title=Theories about Reincarnation and Spirits|journal=Articles from The Path — April 1886 to March 1896 |date=November 1886|volume= I|issue= 8|page=232|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/path/v01n08p232_theories-about-reincarnation-and-spirits.htm|publisher=Theosophical University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|name="HPB on three- and sevenfold conception of man"|In ''[[The Key to Theosophy]]'' Blavatsky explains that the sevenfold conception of man is the threefold conception of man, refined.  In section 6, ''Theosophical Teachings as to Nature and Man'', under the heading ''The Septenary Nature of Man'' it is asked: "Is it what we call Spirit and Soul, and the man of flesh?", to which is replied: "It is not. That is the old Platonic division. Plato was an Initiate, and therefore could not go into forbidden details; but he who is acquainted with the archaic doctrine finds the seven in Plato's various combinations of Soul and Spirit.".&lt;ref name=keytotheosophy&gt;{{cite book|last=Blavatsky|first=H.P.|title=The Key to Theosophy|orig-year=1889|publisher= Theosophical University Press: Online Literature|isbn=1-55700-046-8|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/key/key-hp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Modern Theosophists hold the book as a [[Revelation|revealed]] [[Religious text|work]] dictated to Blavatsky by Theosophy's [[Ascended master|Masters]].&lt;ref name="Clarke 2"&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas, ‘The Coming of the Masters: The Evolutionary Reformulation of Spiritual Intermediaries in Modern Theosophy’, in ''Constructing Tradition: Means and Myths of Transmission in Western Esotericism'', ed. Andreas B. Kilcher (Leiden &amp; Boston, MA: Brill, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[File:Emmette Coleman.png|thumb|[[William Emmette Coleman]]]]
Detractors often accuse the book of extensive unattributed [[plagiarism]], a view first seriously put forth by [[William Emmette Coleman]] shortly after publication and still expressed by modern scholars such as [[Mark Sedgwick]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Sedgwick|Sedgwick, Mark]]. (2004). ''Against the Modern World: Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century''. Oxford University Press. p. 44. {{ISBN|0-19-515297-2}} "''Isis Unveiled'' was extensively plagiarized from a variety of standard works on occultism and Hermeticism (134 pages from Samuel Dunlap's ''Sod, the Son of Man'', 107 pages from Joseph Ennemoser's ''History of Magic'', and so on)."&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Geoffrey Ashe]] notes that ''Isis Unveiled'' combines "comparative religion, occultism, pseudoscience, and fantasy in a mélange that shows genuine if superficial research but is not free from unacknowledged borrowing and downright plagiarism."&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Ashe|Ashe, Geoffrey]]. (2001). ''Encyclopedia of Prophecy''. ABC-CLIO. p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, ''Isis Unveiled'' makes use of a large number of sources popular among occultists at the time, often directly copying significant amounts of text. However, rather than dwelling on the plagiarism, scholars such as Bruce Campbell argue: "Blavatsky was a person who had an original set of insights but who lacked the literary skills and knowledge of English sufficient to create a work on her own. Relying on written sources and help from friends, she formulated a unique and powerful expression of occult ideas."&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; Joscelyn Godwin and K. Paul Johnson note that early scholarship seemed obsessed with the agenda of exposing Helena Blavatsky as a plagiarist and imposter, but such labels do not properly assess the Theosophical Society's place in the cultural, political, religious, and intellectual history of modern times. The work belongs to a broader movement that seeks to integrate the history of the occult sciences and of esoteric movements with more established subdisciplines.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Godwin"/&gt; Modern copies of ''Isis Unveiled'' are often annotated, fully delineating Blavatsky's sources and influences.

Historian [[Ronald H. Fritze]] considers ''Isis Unveiled'' to be a work of [[pseudohistory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald H. Fritze|Fritze, Ronald H]]. (2009). ''Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo-Religions''. Reaktion Books. pp. 41-42. {{ISBN|978-1-86189-430-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Henry R. Evans]], a contemporaneous journalist and magician, described the book as a "hodge-podge of absurdities, pseudo-science, mythology and folk-lore, arranged in helter-skelter fashion, with an utter disregard of logical sequence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry R. Evans|Evans, Henry R]]. (1897). ''Hours with the Ghosts, or, Nineteenth Century Witchcraft: Illustrated Investigations into the Phenomena of Spiritualism and Theosophy''. Laird &amp; Lee. p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; One of Blavatsky's original goals in writing ''Isis Unveiled'' and founding the Theosophical Society was to reconcile contemporary advances in science with occultism, and this synthesis was one of the main appeals of Blavatsky's work for individuals interested in religion but alienated from conventional Western forms at the time.&lt;ref name="Olcott"&gt;Olcott, Henry. ''Old Diary Leaves: The History of the Theosophical Society, I'' (Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1972), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Santucci 2"&gt;Santucci, James A. ''The Notion of Race in Theosophy'', in ''Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions'', 11.3 (2008), pp. 37-63&lt;/ref&gt; Theosophy adopted and addressed many ideas from late nineteenth century science. Some, like Darwin's theory of evolution, have continued to be accepted by the scientific community, while others, like the continent of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], though based on contemporaneous scientific theories, have long since been rendered obsolete by modern advances. Theosophy and [[Occultism]] as a whole gained a level of sophistication through the adoption of religious terms largely absent from the preceding [[Spiritualism]] movement. However, as Theosophy continued to grow as a religion, it became stuck with certain scientific ideas even after they had been discarded by the scientific community. The inability to adapt to scientific progress presents a disparity between modern Theosophy and the society's original motivations.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; K. Paul Johnson also notes that many of the more mythical elements of Blavatsky's works, like her later [[Ascended master|Masters]], rather than being outright inventions, were reformulations of preexisting esoteric ideas and the casting of a large group of individuals—who helped, encouraged, or collaborated with her—under a mythological context; all driven by Blavatsky's search for spiritual truth.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarke 2"/&gt;

[[Sten Bodvar Liljegren]] notes that in addition to contemporaneous occult sources and the prevailing [[orientalism]] of the period, the novels of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] heavily influenced Blavatsky's Theosophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Bader, A. L. (1958). ''Through a Glass Darkly: Spiritualism in the Browning Circle by Katherine H. Porter; Bulwer-Lytton's Novels and "Isis Unveiled" by S. B. Liljegren''. ''[[Victorian Studies]]''. Vol. 2, No. 2. pp. 183-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7704">The following is a '''list of unproduced J. J. Abrams projects''' in roughly chronological order. During a career that has spanned over 30 years, [[J. J. Abrams]] has worked on projects which never progressed beyond the [[pre-production]] stage under his direction.

==1980s==

===''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' (sequel)===
* In 1989, Abrams met [[Steven Spielberg]] at a film festival, where Spielberg spoke about a possible [[Who Framed Roger Rabbit 2|''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' sequel]], with Abrams as a possible writer and with [[Robert Zemeckis]] as producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/who-framed-roger-rabbit-2/|title=J.J. Abrams Once Had a Pitch for Who Framed Roger Rabbit 2|date=March 12, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing came up from this project, although Abrams has some storyboards for a ''[[Roger Rabbit]]'' short.

==2000s==

===''Superman: Flyby''===
* In July 2002, Abrams wrote a script for a possible fifth [[Superman]] film entitled ''[[Superman: Flyby]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_15/15_superman.asp?IshNum=15|title=Cashiers du Cinemart Issue 15:|date=February 16, 2008|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216230219/http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_15/15_superman.asp?IshNum=15|archivedate=February 16, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brett Ratner]] and [[McG]] entered into talks to direct,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/17/ratner-talks-superman|title=Ratner Talks Superman|first=|last=Stax|date=September 17, 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Abrams tried to get the chance to direct his own script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/par-girding-up-for-war-1117908978/|title=Par girding up for ‘War’|first=Michael Fleming, Dave|last=McNary|date=August 12, 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was finally cancelled in 2004 and instead ''[[Superman Returns]]'' was released in 2006.

===''Mystery on Fifth Avenue''===
* In 2008, it was reported that Abrams purchased the rights to a ''[[New York Times]]'' article "Mystery on Fifth Avenue" about the renovation of an 8.5 million dollar co-op, a division of property originally owned by [[E. F. Hutton &amp; Co.]] and [[Marjorie Merriweather Post]], for six figures and was developing a film titled Mystery on Fifth Avenue, with Paramount Pictures and Bad Robot Productions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seigel|first=Tatiana|title=Paramount, Abrams keep house|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117987620?refCatId=13|publisher=Variety|accessdate=June 17, 2008|date=June 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comedy writers Maya Forbes and [[Wally Wolodarsky]] to write the adaptation. According to the article, a wealthy couple Steven B. Klinsky and Maureen Sherry purchased the apartment in 2003 and live there with their four children. Soon after purchasing the apartment, they hired young architectural designer [[Eric Clough]], who devised an elaborately clever "scavenger hunt" built into the apartment that involved dozens of historical figures, a fictional book and a soundtrack, woven throughout the apartment in puzzles, riddles, secret panels, compartments, and hidden codes, without the couple's knowledge. The family didn't discover the embedded mystery until months after moving into the apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reagan |first=Gillian |title=J.J.

===''Samurai Jack'' (film)===
* In November 2009, it was reported that Abrams and [[Bad Robot Productions]] were producing, along with [[Cartoon Network Movies]],  [[Warner Bros.]], [[Frederator Films]] and [[Paramount Pictures]], a [[Samurai Jack (film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[Samurai Jack]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmjunk.com/2009/11/19/j-j-abrams-producing-samurai-jack-the-movie/|title=J.J. Abrams Producing Samurai Jack: The Movie - Film Junk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2012, series creator [[Genndy Tartakovsky]] stated that the production of the film was scrapped after Abrams' departure from the project to direct ''[[Star Trek (2009)|Star Trek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/727845-a-preview-of-sony-animations-hotel-transylvania|title=A Preview of Sony Animation's Hotel Transylvania - ComingSoon.net|date=June 26, 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this and other reasons, Tartakovsky decided to make a [[Samurai Jack (season 5)|new season]] instead of a feature film.

===''Micronauts'' (film)===
* In 2009, it was reported that Abrams and [[Bad Robot Productions]] would produce a film based on the [[Micronauts]] toy line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125737028160428961|title=The Cry Goes Out in Hollywood: 'Get Me Mr. Potato Head's Agent!'|first=Lauren A.

==2010s==

===''Portal'' and ''Half-Life'' (films)===
* Abrams announced at the 2013 [[D.I.C.E. Summit]] that Bad Robot Productions had made a deal with [[Valve Corporation]] to produce a film based on either the video game ''[[Portal (video game series)|Portal]]'' or ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Graser|first=Marc|title=J.J.

===''Alias'', ''Lost'', and ''Felicity'' (films)===
* In January 2014, during the promotion of the TV series ''[[Believe (TV series)|Believe]]'', it was reported that Abrams was interested in making film adaptations of ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' and ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/501467/j-j-abrams-on-whether-felicity-lost-or-alias-movies-would-ever-happen|title=Felicity Movie?

'''Kenneth Barlow''' is a fictional character from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'', played by [[William Roache]]. Ken was created by [[Tony Warren]] as one of ''Coronation Street's'' original characters. He debuted in the soap's first episode on 9 December 1960.&lt;ref name=mark&gt;{{cite web|title=Corrie's Bill will mark half century|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/392569-corries-bill-will-mark-half-century|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=([[Associated Newspapers]])|accessdate=29 April 2011|date=7 November 2008&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJaIy3QM?url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/392569-corries-bill-will-mark-half-century --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having appeared continuously since, December 2010 marked Ken's 50th anniversary on-screen, making Roache the longest-serving actor in a televised soap opera. Roache was honoured at the 2010 [[Guinness World Records]] ceremony for the achievement, when he surpassed actor [[Don Hastings]] from the American soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]]'', who previously held this title. Roache stated in 2010 that he has no plans to leave the role and will remain in ''Coronation Street'' for as long as they will have him.

Ken was introduced as the educated son of a working-class family. Portrayed as moralistic and a political activist, Ken differed from the other, predominantly working-class characters in the soap opera. The character developed a reputation as a ladies' man; plots saw Ken dating numerous women, marrying four times to three women ([[Valerie Tatlock]] in 1962, [[Janet Reid]] in 1972, [[Deirdre Hunt]] in 1981 and again in 2005), fathering four children with three different women ([[Lawrence Cunningham (Coronation Street)|Lawrence Cunningham]] in 1961 from Ken's affair with [[Susan Cunningham (Coronation Street)|Susan Cunningham]] but he never knew about Lawrence until 2010, Twins in 1965 with [[Susan Barlow]] and [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] from Ken's marriage to [[Valerie Tatlock]], and in 1995 [[Daniel Osbourne (Coronation Street)|Daniel Osbourne]] from Ken's affair with [[Denise Osbourne]]), and adopting Deirdre's daughter ([[Tracy Barlow]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moss|first=John|title=Coronation Street, Granada Television, Manchester|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/392569-corries-bill-will-mark-half-century|work=Manchester UK|accessdate=29 April 2011|year=2002&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJaM6yhS?url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/392569-corries-bill-will-mark-half-century--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the many women Ken has been paired with, his relationship with Deirdre has been the most enduring. Ken and Deirdre's fictional relationship made newspaper headlines in Britain in 1983 due to Deirdre's adultery with [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]]. The storyline captured both media and viewer interest. 20 million people tuned in to watch Ken's discovery of the affair. The storyline lead to a feud between Ken and Mike, prominent in both characters' narratives until Mike's screen death in 2006. In March 2017, ''Coronation Street'' centred a "[[whodunit]]" storyline around the character, where Ken is pushed down the stairs by an unknown assailant, with the storyline being dubbed, "[[Who Attacked Ken?]]". On 26 May 2017, Ken's attacker was revealed as his son, [[Daniel Osbourne (Coronation Street)|Daniel Osbourne]] ([[Rob Mallard]]).

Despite his somewhat antagonistic role in the show's early years, Ken developed a reputation among critics for representing an archetypal "boring man". This is an allegation denied by Roache, who has cited Ken's evolution over the years, his chaotic love life and dysfunctional family as evidence to the contrary. Roache has been honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the [[British Soap Awards]] for his portrayal of Ken. Away from the canonical serial, Ken has been portrayed by [[James Roache]] (William Roache's son) in the dramatisation ''[[The Road to Coronation Street]]'', and by Simon Chadwick in the play ''[[Corrie!]]''. He has also been spoofed by impressionist [[Jon Culshaw]].

==Storylines==
Ken is born and raised in Coronation Street, Weatherfield, [[Lancashire]], on 9 October 1939. He is the eldest son born to [[Frank Barlow (Coronation Street)|Frank]] (Frank Pemberton) and [[Ida Barlow]] ([[Noel Dyson]]). An intelligent pupil, Ken attends grammar school after passing his [[eleven plus]] exam and in 1957 wins a scholarship at [[Manchester University]]; he lives with his parents and brother [[David Barlow (Coronation Street)|David]] ([[Alan Rothwell]]) in [[Weatherfield]] while studying and gains a [[second class honours]] degree in History and English. Being educated and politically minded, Ken differs from his family and neighbours. This is a source of friction between Ken and his father Frank, who believes Ken is trying to distance himself from his working-class roots. When Ken writes a scathing newspaper article about his uneducated neighbours in Weatherfield, Frank and the community are outraged. In 1961, Ken's mother dies in a motor accident. Ken turns down a teaching post to support his father, but he and Frank continue to clash until Frank leaves in 1964. David and Frank's deaths in 1968 and 1971 respectively, leave Ken as the sole surviving Barlow.

Ken begins teaching, and marries [[Valerie Tatlock]] ([[Anne Reid]]) in July 1962. Two years later, he has a fling with exotic dancer Pip Mistral (Elaine Stevens), but his marriage survives. Twins [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter]] (Robert Heanue) and [[Susan Barlow|Susan]] (Katie Heanneau) are born on 15 April 1965. In January 1966, Ken has another affair with reporter [[Jackie Marsh (Coronation Street)|Jackie Marsh]] (Pamela Craig). Valerie leaves when she finds out, but is later persuaded to return. Ken continues to stand up for his political beliefs, and spends seven days in prison in March 1967, after being arrested for protesting. Ken is left a single-parent following Valerie's untimely death; she perishes after being electrocuted in January 1971, and Ken is left heartbroken. Ken is supported by Valerie's uncle [[Albert Tatlock]] ([[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]]), with whom he shares a close relationship, but caring for the twins proves too difficult and they are sent to live with their grandparents in [[Glasgow]].

Ken has numerous flings, including a one-night stand with [[Rita Littlewood]] ([[Barbara Knox]]), but his next serious relationship occurs in 1973, when Ken marries [[Janet Reid]] ([[Judith Barker]]), in the hope that she will mother his two children. Janet refuses to do this, and in 1974 they separate. Janet flits in and out of Ken's life until 1977, when she kills herself by taking an overdose when Ken turns down a reconciliation.

When [[Ray Langton]] ([[Neville Buswell]]) leaves his wife [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) in 1978, Ken supports her. In 1981 they marry, with Ken becoming stepfather to Deirdre's four-year-old daughter [[Tracy Barlow|Tracy]] (Christabel Finch). However, by 1983, Deirdre grows bored with Ken and has an affair with his rival, [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]). Ken and Deirdre's marriage suffers; the couple separate in 1990, and eventually divorce following Ken's affair with [[Wendy Crozier]] (Roberta Kerr), his colleague at the local newspaper, ''The Weatherfield Recorder''. Ken takes the separation badly and attempts suicide by overdose, but is prevented from doing so by his friend, [[Bet Lynch]] ([[Julie Goodyear]]).

Ken and Mike, who are the moral opposites of each other, remain enemies; Ken is incensed when his daughter, Susan, falls in love and has a short-lived marriage with Mike. In 1991 Ken and Mike compete for the same woman, [[Alma Sedgewick]] ([[Amanda Barrie]]). When she is dumped by Mike in favour of [[Jackie Ingram]] (Shirin Taylor), she starts seeing Ken. On Christmas Day 1991, Mike lures Alma back into his bed to get back at Ken. Later in 1992, Ken falls for one of his pupil's mothers&amp;nbsp;– Maggie Redman (Jill Kerman). The Baldwin/Barlow feud erupts again, as Mike is the father of Maggie's son, [[Mark Redman (Coronation Street)|Mark]] (Christopher Oakswood). Mike hates the thought of Ken spending Christmas Day with his son, but Ken's pride gets the better of him. He cannot handle the situation, and he and Maggie split.

Ken has a relationship with hairdresser [[Denise Osbourne]] ([[Denise Black]]) in 1994 and fathers her child; their son [[Daniel Osbourne (Coronation Street)|Daniel]] (Lewis Harney) is born in 1995. Denise agrees to marry Ken, but is having an affair with her brother-in-law Brian Dunkley ([[Benny Young]]) at the same time. She leaves Weatherfield in 1996, leaving Daniel with Ken. It is a short-lived custody as, later that year, Denise returns and snatches Daniel; Ken's attempts to reclaim his son fail.

Ken and Deirdre remain close, despite their other relationships. They reunite in 1999, following encouragement from Deidre's mother [[Blanche Hunt|Blanche]] ([[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]). They eventually remarry on 8 April 2005; although Ken discovers that Deirdre slept with [[Dev Alahan]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]) in 2001, he forgives her and they remain together. Deirdre supports Ken in 2002 when he loses his teaching post for assaulting a pupil, Aidan Critchley (Dean Ashton), who has been terrorising him. Marital problems arise in 2006 when, following Mike's death from [[Alzheimer's]], Ken grows jealous of Deirdre's grief reaction; he leaves home and tries to rebuild a relationship with his estranged son Daniel. Daniel's mother Denise, now single, gets the wrong idea and attempts to rekindle a romance with Ken; Ken rebuffs her advances and returns to Deirdre. Ken does stray in 2009, after meeting [[Martha Fraser]] ([[Stephanie Beacham]]). Ken falls in love with Martha, and in May 2009, plans to leave with her. He cannot go through with it, and he jilts her, returning to Deirdre. Eventually he admits to the infidelity. Although Deirdre is angry, she forgives him as he had forgiven her fling with Dev; however, Deirdre later cheats on Ken again, kissing [[Lewis Archer]] ([[Nigel Havers]]). Relations are once again strained between Ken and Deirdre. The couple acknowledge their mutual unhappiness with their marriage, but remain together.

In late August 2010 [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]] ([[Malcolm Hebden]]) discovers an unopened letter addressed to Ken, dating back to the 1960s. The letter is written by Ken's first girlfriend, [[Susan Cunningham (Coronation Street)|Susan Cunningham]] ([[Patricia Shakesby]]), whom Ken had dated in 1960. Susan has a son named [[Lawrence Cunningham (Coronation Street)|Lawrence]] ([[Linus Roache]]), who turns out to be Ken's child. Ken and Lawrence bond, which temporarily threatens Ken's relationship with his other son Peter. When Ken discovers that Lawrence is intolerant of the homosexuality of his own son, [[James Cunningham (Coronation Street)|James]] ([[James Roache]]), Ken severs contact. Realising that he has been unappreciative and neglectful of Peter over the years, he makes an effort to bond, supporting him through his relationship and health problems that follow.

In December 2010, Peter is caught up in the Joinery Bar gas leak explosion, which then resulted in an unforgettable tram crash, as the explosion severed the tramline above. Ken was fearful that his son was going to die and this was almost the case when Peter went into cardiac arrest, after marrying [[Leanne Battersby|Leanne]] on his hospital bed; Peter survived. Ken supported Peter and Leanne as the former struggled to regain a sense of reality, because the explosion left him paralysed, potentially for life. Meanwhile, James comes to stay with the Barlows for a while, with no-one knowing that his rôle in a soup kitchen in town is actually part of a scam. When Ken discovers this, James packs his things and takes off. Ken tried to make him stay but James pushed him out of the way, knocking him unconscious. Ken was not seriously hurt though.

Ken doesn't know where his loyalties lie when Peter is found to be having an affair with [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), and he is estranged from son, Simon. Ken is then shocked to discover that Peter has been indicted for the murder of Frank Foster (Andrew Lancel), who had been found not guilty of raping Carla. He tries to help but is pushed away. Eventually it is found that Frank's mother Anne was the real culprit. She is given a custodial sentence, whilst Peter is free to go.

In mid-2013, Ken leaves the street temporarily to look after his grandson Adam in Canada. (a plot devised due to actor William Roache on leave after being arrested). He returns in August 2014 to find his family in chaos. Peter has been imprisoned for the murder of his secret lover [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]) and Tracy is engaged to Carla's despicable brother [[Rob Donovan|Rob]] ([[Marc Baylis]]),

Carla had been pregnant with Peter's baby but had a miscarriage after they separated and Deirdre has fallen apart at the prospect of dealing with all this on her own. Ken is infuriated that Deirdre did not tell him sooner about all this and sets out to clear Peter's name, only to find that the majority of residents on the street, including Simon, believes that Peter did kill Tina. Ken is not sure who to believe anymore. He later discovers that Peter has sacked his lawyer and it becomes even more likely that he will be found guilty of the murder.

Deirdre goes to stay with her [[Bev Unwin|friend]] in October 2014, when it becomes clear the stress of the trial is destroying her. Peter is found guilty of the murder and sentenced to life in prison. However, the verdict is quickly reversed, when it is discovered that it was actually Rob who murdered Tina. Peter is released from prison but makes the decision to leave the street, as he has hardly anything keeping him around, which hurts Simon. Ken tries to make Peter change his mind but he is adamant on leaving, so Ken respects his wishes and sees him off At this point, Deirdre should have come home but called back to say she was staying with Bev a while longer, as one of her relatives had just died.

In July 2015, Deirdre dies and Ken is absolutely devastated by this news. Liz announces Deirdre's passing in the Rovers Return. Deirdre's funeral is held the week after. It is revealed that Deirdre would have been home earlier. However, news of Tracy and Tony's fling reached her and she was ashamed to come home and face Liz. As a result, Ken feels animosity toward Tracy for seemingly stealing Deirdre's last two months from him, when she could have been home when she died.

Ken and Nessa begin dating much to the disapproval of Emily and Rita. Tracy is deeply upset and accuses Ken of betraying Deirdre. Ken kicks Tracy out when he discovers that Tracy has seen her ex–fiancée Rob, who's in prison for murder. In early 2016, Ken dumps Nessa after finding out Nessa had an affair with her sister Cathy's late husband. In October 2016 Ken is shocked to see his son Peter. He accuses Peter of drinking. After their argument, Ken suffers a stroke and he is hospitalised.

In early 2017, Ken's son Daniel is offered a place at [[Oxford University]]. He decides not to go choosing to support his new girlfriend Sinead, who fell pregnant. Ken later turns on Sinead saying she has "trapped Daniel" and blames her for his son not going to university, something that he wishes he had done in 1960. He realized that he had wasted his time being with Deirdre&lt;!--What does this bit mean?! ... than his kids --&gt;, and wishes that he had not married her, but truly loved her more than his other wives, despite her affair with men like Adam's father Mike in 1983. He mentions to Audrey that he has chosen his adoptive daughter Tracy as his favourite, for her mother's true love, over his other children, despite her actions, and wanted to leave her in his will everything. After pushing his family away from him and making Sinead have a secret abortion Ken is pushed down the stairs and left for dead by an unknown assailant. He recovers from his injuries in hospital.

==Creation and development==

===Casting===
[[File:Ken Barlow (1960).jpg|thumb|[[Frank Barlow (Coronation Street)|Frank]] (''left'') and Ken (''right''), in the Barlows' first scene. The juxtaposition of Frank eating in his shirtsleeves, meal smothered in brown sauce, and Ken in a tie, disdainful of the condiment, was used to establish Ken's characterisation as a snob, in conflict with his parents over his rejection of his working-class roots.&lt;ref name="Sauce"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEgan|Egan 2010]], p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ken Barlow is one of the twenty-two original ''Coronation Street'' characters devised by series creator [[Tony Warren]]. He made his debut in the soap's first episode, broadcast on 9 December 1960. While auditionees for the other twenty-one original roles were drawn from casting director Margaret Morris' contacts in the north of England, Warren spotted William Roache performing in the [[Granada Television]] play ''Marking Time'', and knew that he was the right actor to play Ken.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Roache almost declined the invitation to audition: "I wasn't interested. I had my flat in London, I was getting acting parts and it all looked very rosy."&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/notw/showbiz/994127/Coronation-Streets-Bill-Roache-50-years-as-Ken-Barlow.html |title=What a Corrie on |work=[[News of the World]] |publisher=[[News International]] |date=26 September 2010 |accessdate=26 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJafAbeP?url=http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/notw/public/home/?login%3Dfalse%26url%3Dhttp://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/notw/showbiz/994127/Coronation-Streets-Bill-Roache-50-years-as-Ken-Barlow.html |archivedate=29 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He changed his mind at the insistence of his agent, and attended the audition, at which he was asked to read ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper in a [[Lancashire accent]]. Roache believes that his indifference towards being cast had a positive impact on his audition, as it enabled him to relax. Two pilot episodes were filmed, with Ken played by Roache in one, and by actor [[Philip Lowrie]] in the other.&lt;ref name="P40"&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; Lowrie was later cast in the role of another original character, [[Dennis Tanner]].&lt;ref name="lowrie"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1406277_coronation_streets_original_bad_boy_dennis_tanner_returns_43_years_on|title=Coronation Street's original bad boy Dennis Tanner returns 43 years on|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=25 January 2011|accessdate=29 April 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJaZHUlV?url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1406277_coronation_streets_original_bad_boy_dennis_tanner_returns_43_years_on--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roache was initially offered the role of Ken on a thirteen-episode, six-week contract.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bath"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/news/long-haul/article-2968739-detail/article.html|title=In for the long haul|work=[[Bath Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]]|date=9 October 2010 |accessdate=26 April 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJaaneH3?url=http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/news/long-haul/article-2968739-detail/article.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; His agent convinced him to take it, as it would enhance his exposure around the broadcast of ''Marking Time''.&lt;ref name="P40"/&gt; ''Coronation Street'' was a hit with viewers and its contract was extended. Roache was given a six-month contract in early 1961, followed by a one-year contract in June of that year, which he deemed amazing security at a time when he had been "leading a hand-to-mouth existence".&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.59.&lt;/ref&gt; The series became a long-running soap opera, airing multiple times weekly, and Roache continued in the role, though gradually ceased to affect a Lancashire accent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; Roache originally earned ₤10 per episode, compared to the ₤3,000 per episode that he earned in 2010.&lt;ref name=fiftyfacts/&gt; He stated in 2010 that although he initially only intended to feature in ''Coronation Street'' for a short time, once he had filmed it and it was transmitted with "such colossal impact", he realised it was something special.&lt;ref name="thisisnottingham"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramaswamy|first=Chitra|title=It's a wonderful life with Ken Barlow, says Ilkeston's William Roache|url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/news/s-wonderful-life-Ken-Barlow-says-Ilkeston-s-William-Roache/article-2894374-detail/article.html|work=[[Nottingham Post]]|publisher=([[Northcliffe Media]])|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=15 November 2010&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNl1Iaac?url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/news/s-wonderful-life-Ken-Barlow-says-Ilkeston-s-William-Roache/article-2894374-detail/article.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Roache needed to be sure it wasn't a mistake to sign up; later he said, "If I had known it would turn out to be my life's work, I would have run a mile."&lt;ref name=fiftyfacts/&gt;

According to writer [[Daran Little]], Roache was partly responsible for the name of the street where the soap is set, ''Coronation Street'', which also serves as the programme's title. The soap was originally titled ''Florizel Street'' when it was commissioned. Roache reportedly could not pronounce Florizel, so the name of the street was changed to ''Coronation Street''.&lt;ref name="roadto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1307060/In-1960-gritty-new-ITV-drama-called-Coronation-Street-aired-7-412-episodes-later-origins-recreated--BBC.html|title=In 1960, a gritty new ITV drama called Coronation Street first aired: 7,412 episodes later its origins have been recreated&amp;nbsp;– on the BBC|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|date=28 October 2010|accessdate=29 April 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJah2gdR?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1307060/In-1960-gritty-new-ITV-drama-called-Coronation-Street-aired-7-412-episodes-later-origins-recreated--BBC.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longevity===
By 1984, Ken was the only character from the original cast who remained in the serial.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.155.&lt;/ref&gt; He became the only original character to remain with the show continuously into 2010, its 50th year.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; Roache has revealed that Ken's role in the serial was threatened in 1964, when producer Tim Aspinall, who was dubbed the "mad axe-man", took the helm of ''Coronation Street''. Aspinall culled a variety of characters from the serial, including fan favourite [[Martha Longhurst]] ([[Lynne Carol]]), and Ken was one of the characters he wished to axe: "He had a kind of hit list of characters. He decided who he wanted out, while others including myself were put on warning that we were likely to be given the chop at a later date. It was appalling," recalls Roache.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; A potential storyline was devised in which Ken and his then wife Valerie would move to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ken was given a reprieve, as before he could be axed, Aspinall was removed from his position.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;

Spiritual enlightenment and a desire for self-improvement led Roache to consider quitting the series in the early 1970s, as he struggled with being in "the most ego-driven profession there is". He ultimately decided to stay—a decision he is happy with in retrospect, as his qualms were never with the series itself, but the way he felt personally.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Roache pledged to stay with ''Coronation Street'': "I'm not even thinking about retiring. It isn't an option and I don't want to even consider it [...] I love the Street and while they want me and while I can do it I want to carry on. I don't care if I'm 120, I'll still be there."&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; Roache said in 2010, "When people ask me why I've played the same role for 50 years I try to explain that I haven't because like all human beings, and thanks to clever script-writers, Ken's evolved. He’s been married three times, had 24 girlfriends and is head of a totally dysfunctional family. He has a son [Peter] who's an alcoholic bigamist and a daughter [Tracy] who's a convicted murderer. How many actors get the chance to perform scenes with meaty content like that?"&lt;ref name="MEN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1345234_william_roache_me_ken_barlow_and_my_friend_emma|title=William Roache: Me, Ken Barlow and my friend Emma|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=9 October 2010 |accessdate=29 April 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJanSza0?url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1345234_william_roache_me_ken_barlow_and_my_friend_emma--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote="Ken has always been very earnest and honourable in his views, and he's tried to do the right thing. The trouble is that like any other human being he is flawed: we all are. When it came to the sort of job he would do, it was clear that teaching fitted perfectly with him as a person. Not only did it help satisfy him intellectually, it also allowed him to help others and at the same time give him a degree of control, which he probably always wanted. I always thought of him during that first decade as a young man who had a very stubborn streak in him when it came to his principles and what he thought was right."
|source=— Roache on Ken's early characterisation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tony Warren created Ken as a "[[zeitgeist]]" of modern times in 1960,&lt;ref name="roadto"/&gt; and it has been suggested that Ken is a "prism through which to read the political and cultural history of the last half century".&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/17/coronation-street-ken-barlow-bore|title=In praise of Ken Barlow|first=Joe|last=Moran|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=([[Guardian News and Media]])|date=17 November 2010|accessdate=29 April 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJsPUx8X?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/nov/17/coronation-street-ken-barlow-bore--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the soap's early years, Ken was frequently presented as resenting what he saw as the anti-intellectual, repressed climate around him, and author Dorothy Hobson has suggested that Ken was ashamed of his working-class roots.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDorothy|Hobson 2003]], p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; Roache concurs that Ken obviously had higher aspirations than "being stuck in Coronation Street", but notes that "he was also portrayed as a nice young guy who was happy to help out if he could."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.54.&lt;/ref&gt; Roache considers himself "the guardian of Ken", responsible for ensuring that his actions and dialogue remain true to the character. This responsibility lead to a two-year quarrel with his co-star [[Pat Phoenix]], when she insisted that her character, [[Elsie Tanner]], undermine Ken in an argument. Annoyed at Ken being belittled and the scene stripped of its "dramatic impact", Roache rowed with Phoenix, who did not speak to him again—outside of their scenes together—for two years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.83–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in 2010 stated, "in the beginning Ken was an angry young man who, as a student, was representative of the millions who had benefited from post-war reforms, such as free education for the gifted."&lt;ref name="roadto"/&gt; ''The Guardian''{{'s}} Joe Moran likened Ken to [[Richard Hoggart]]'s scholarship boy "the 'uprooted and anxious' figure whose education had alienated him from his working-class origins."&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Moran suggested that Ken has led "what Hoggart once called a 'carousel life', a life not of the upward trajectory of the professional career but of living from year to year and taking whatever job turns up." Moran added that Ken "refused to go along with the last half century's stress on consumer aspiration and meritocratic elitism", but added that by modern standards, "Ken has wasted his education and his life. He has played little part in 'wealth creation' [...] and is still stuck in the same house he lived in when he was a student, leading his carousel life, stoically and decently."&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

Ken's political stance is [[Centre-left|left]]-[[Liberalism|liberal]]. He has been described as the most famous fictional reader of ''[[The Guardian]]'', a newspaper that attracts readers of the mainstream left of British political opinion.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Ken has had several forays into journalism for left-wing publications over the years, and was occasionally shown to be frustrated that his political views were not shared by others.&lt;ref name="left"/&gt; A scathing article he wrote for a newspaper in which he labelled his neighbours as "lazy-minded, politically ignorant, starved of a real culture and prejudiced against any advance in human insight and scientific progress" led to clashes with his father and a fistfight at the [[Rovers Return Inn|Rovers]] with [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]]).&lt;ref name="left"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_cinema/s/2083764_corries_ken_barlow_takes_a_stroll_down_memory_lane|title=Corrie's Ken Barlow takes a stroll down memory lane|work=[[Reading Post]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|date=9 December 2010|accessdate=29 April 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJsW0gUo?url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_cinema/s/2083764_corries_ken_barlow_takes_a_stroll_down_memory_lane}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ken has occasionally espoused socialist ideology, Roache suggests that he is really more of a "liberal, fair-minded guy [...] always looking to right the wrongs of society",&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.120.&lt;/ref&gt; and "a man of integrity who fights for what he thinks is right".&lt;ref name="Kay32"&gt;[[#refKay|Kay 1991]], p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Graeme Kay discussed Ken's evolution within the show: "He began as a bit of a prig, in the eyes of working-class father Frank, but matured into a sound family man, only to go astray. He changed from teacher to newspaper owner, through various jobs, but threw that away too. He has always liked to see himself as a big fish in a small pond, with his steely, domineering manner and feeling of superior intellect."&lt;ref name="Kay32"/&gt; Little suggested that Ken has transformed from an angry young man who never fitted in and was always challenging the system, into a bore next door, eventually discovering that he couldn't change the world after all. Little dubbed Ken Coronation Street's elder statesman and lynch-pin, a one-man [[Greek tragedy]], and the greatest survivor in Weatherfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/KEN+BARLOW+IN+THE+CORONATION+ST+FILES%3a+Angry+Young+Man+who's+turned...-a0125615729|title=Ken Barlow in the Coronation St files: Angry Young Man who's turned into the bore next door.|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Daran|last=Little|date=2 December 2004|accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character has a reputation amongst critics as boring and a man of morals; Moran dubbed him the archetypal boring man.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Chronicling the history of ''Coronation Street'' in 2007, [[Virgin Media]] stated, "Perhaps unfairly dubbed boring, Ken is ultimately an intelligent man, frustrated by the cards life has dealt him&amp;nbsp;– although the hair, clothes and strong morals haven't helped."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/soaps/coronation-street-history2.php|title=Coronation Street: Who's Who?|publisher=[[Virgin Media]]|date=25 January 2007|accessdate=3 June 2009&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJatQAea?url=http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/soaps/coronation-street-history2.php--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular perception of Ken as being boring originated, in Roache's view, around the time of the Ken–Deirdre–Mike love triangle storyline. He refutes the label, particularly as Ken has had numerous romantic dalliances during his tenure.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.131.&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Price of the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' called him the Street's resident intellectual, who has never quite managed to break free from his roots.&lt;ref name="welsh"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/2008/10/04/meet-the-man-behind-corrie-s-ken-barlow-91466-21952303/|title=Meet the man behind Corrie's Ken Barlow|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Karen|last=Price|date=4 October 2008|accessdate=16 February 2009&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJarFlGN?url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/2008/10/04/meet-the-man-behind-corrie-s-ken-barlow-91466-21952303/--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Ken is renowned for having had multiple relationships with women during his time in ''Coronation Street''. Discussing this, author Hobson has suggested that Ken's numerous relationships could give the impression that the character is a lothario or a great romantic; however, Hobson noted that this would be inaccurate as Ken is "neither a great romantic nor someone with whom you would be wise to trust your romantic or emotional future. In fact, he is one of the characters about whom audiences would tend to want to warn any female characters to 'stay away, it'll end in tears'.&lt;ref name="Hobson129"&gt;[[#refDorothy|Hobson 2003]], p.129.&lt;/ref&gt; Roache feels that Ken's approach to romance early in his tenure belied his educated, intellectual affectations, and revealed him to be a typical "northern working-class man at heart." He explained: "[Ken] was the sort who wanted to have a wife who would stay at home, look after the kids and make sure the house was run smoothly, while he went off to work to pursue a career. It was very old-fashioned in many ways, but he could never see it that way and it was often left to the women he had relationships with to remind him of that trait in his character."&lt;ref name="P107"/&gt;

Ken's many relationships have been marred by infidelities. Despite being generally "well-meaning", Roache assessed that for the first two decades of ''Coronation Street'', Ken had a ruthless streak where women were involved. While he has since mellowed somewhat, he was initially a "sensitive, thinking chauvinist who liked the idea of having a wife who was always there for him, but at the same time [...] found nothing wrong with flirting or going off with another woman."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; ITV publicity noted how many relationships and flings he has had, stating "This could take a while ... Ken has had more girlfriends than most of the Street’s male residents put together."&lt;ref name=stvv&gt;{{cite web|title=Ken Barlow |url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/home/65702-ken-barlow/ |work=[[STV (TV network)|STV]] |publisher=([[STV Group plc]]) |accessdate=2 May 2011 |date=17 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223050530/http://entertainment.stv.tv/home/65702-ken-barlow/ |archivedate=23 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the periods of 1960 and 2007, Ken married four times and dated 27 women, including a character played by the then unknown actress [[Joanna Lumley]], who played headmaster's daughter Elaine Perkins in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/55759-retirement-not-an-option-for-bill|title=Retirement 'not an option' for Bill|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|date=4 July 2007|accessdate=16 February 2009&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJb0JR4R?url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/55759-retirement-not-an-option-for-bill--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Valerie Tatlock====
Ken's first notable relationship in the serial was with the character Valerie Tatlock (Anne Reid) in 1961. Roache and Reid had been to neighbouring schools, which gave them common ground and a relaxed attitude to working together.&lt;ref name="P40Little"/&gt; Ken's relationship with Valerie became popular with viewers. Roache once attributed their success to his own rapport with Reid, citing it as a helpful element in their on-screen chemistry. Ken and Valerie married on 4 August 1962. Executive producer [[H. V. Kershaw]] was aware of their popularity, and requested that Granada Television's evening duty officer be made available on the night of broadcast, in order to take phone calls of congratulations from viewers. Although no calls were made, 20&amp;nbsp;million viewers watched the wedding episode. Reid was "thrilled" with the reaction to the wedding. Roache was initially skeptical about the impact marriage would have on Ken's development. Roache said: "I was a sort of young semi-heartthrob in those days and thought getting married was going to finish all that."&lt;ref name="P40Little"&gt;[[#refLittle|Little 1995]], pp.40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that, given Ken's aspirations of upward social mobility and desire to leave Weatherfield, marriage conflicted with his characterisation, but realised it was necessary for the writers to anchor him in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerie gave birth to twins, Peter and Susan, and became a housewife to look after them. All scenes involving the child actors were filmed separately from episodic shoots, to avoid unwanted noise ruining Roache and Reid's scenes. In one storyline, Ken had to start looking after the children more frequently, but he grew bored and would often leave them unattended. Valerie accused him of attempted murder on one occasion when a small house fire occurred&amp;nbsp;– with the twins trapped inside.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLittle|Little 1995]], pp.57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; His boredom with his marriage caused him to have an affair with Jackie Marsh (Pamela Craig). There were only "kissing scenes" written into scripts, but the production team made it clear they were having a sexual relationship. The storyline "horrified" viewers, and Craig received abusive letters from angry fans. Craig knew nothing more than a short affair could occur between the pair. On-screen Elsie Tanner convinced him to end the affair; Valerie found out, but forgave him.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLittle|Little 1995]], pp.63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Roache enjoyed the aftermath, as it added a new dimension to Ken, whereby "He was a married man with kids, and had all of those good intentions, but he was also liable to stray and clearly had trouble resisting the temptation of another woman."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken and Valerie's marriage came to an untimely end in 1971. Following Reid's decision to leave the role&amp;nbsp;– having grown bored of playing the character&amp;nbsp;– the producers opted to kill Valerie off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvthrong.co.uk/coronation-street/coronation-street-mikey-north-says-guys-want-date-his-onscreen-mum-and-anne-reid-was-%E2%80%9Cdesperate%E2%80%9D-leave |title=Anne Reid was "desperate" to leave |work=TV Throng |publisher= |date=25 January 2011 |accessdate=29 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723100304/http://www.tvthrong.co.uk/coronation-street/coronation-street-mikey-north-says-guys-want-date-his-onscreen-mum-and-anne-reid-was-%E2%80%9Cdesperate%E2%80%9D-leave |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reid and Roache were briefly concerned that her departure would result in Ken being written out, and Roache recalls that Ken emigrating with the twins was a scenario under consideration.

After the fatal shock, she knocked over an electric heater, setting the Barlow's house on fire; it has been dubbed one of the most sensational soap departures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-94316/Sensational-soap-departures.html|title=Sensational soap departures|first=Isobel|last=Fox|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|date=26 April 2011|accessdate=29 April 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNkO3f1c?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-94316/Sensational-soap-departures.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A then-record audience tuned in for Valerie's death, scripted by [[Leslie Duxbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/10325/leslie-duxbury|title=Leslie Duxbury|first=Patrick|last=Newley|work=[[The Stage]]|publisher=The Stage Newspaper Ltd|date=7 November 2005|accessdate=29 April 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNkb65IN?url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/10325/leslie-duxbury--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following episode ended with Ken walking through the burned remains of their home, in a scene that Roache has deemed one of his "most enjoyable and satisfying moments in ''Coronation Street''."&lt;ref name="VDeath"/&gt;

====Janet Reid====

|quote="Janet clearly saw Ken as someone who might provide the sort of lifestyle she wanted if he was pushed and manoeuvred in the right direction. She had plans for them to move away from the Street and into a bigger house, and went along with the idea Ken had of getting the twins back to live with them, while all along having no intention of sharing a home with his kids. it soon became clear that the marriage was not going to be a happy one, and Janet was no Val."
|source=— Roache, on Ken and Janet's relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.108.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Ken's second marriage in the serial was to a character named Janet Reid (Judith Barker) in 1973; their relationship was short-lived.&lt;ref name="barlows"/&gt; There was no buildup to their marriage; Ken returned from Scotland and introduced Janet as his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richardson |first=Anne |title=Corrie's Best Characters: No 2&amp;nbsp;– Ken Barlow |url=http://www.aoltv.co.uk/2010/12/09/corries-best-characters-no-2-ken-barlow/ |work=[[AOL]] |accessdate=8 May 2011 |date=9 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yXB1Ud0v?url=http://www.aoltv.co.uk/2010/12/09/corries-best-characters-no-2-ken-barlow/ |archivedate= 8 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline's fast pace angered Roache; he once stressed: "I was very cross about the whole thing. There was no wedding, she just arrived, no build-up to it. It was just like an idea that was shoved in. I wasn't happy."&lt;ref name=lill/&gt; The storyline was unpopular with viewers, who did not approve of the wedding. Janet was already an unpopular character by then, because of her previous affairs with two other ''Coronation Street'' males. Barker said Janet was often perceived as treating Ken unfairly. She openly showed her dislike for his children and sent them to boarding school. The situation saw Ken realise he was in a "loveless marriage"&amp;nbsp;– a match made whilst feeling lonely and under the presumption that she was his last chance of happiness. The breakdown of their marriage was accompanied by what Little dubbed "a series of spectacular rows", which saw Ken become violent towards Janet.&lt;ref name=lill&gt;[[#refLittle|Little 1995]], p.116.&lt;/ref&gt; One such row, which followed Ken's discovery of Janet's plans to send the twins to boarding school, was later used as an exercise in drama schools, which Roache deemed "a nice compliment to everyone involved in creating the moment."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Janet and Ken split up in 1974. Barker was included in the series on and off for a few years, as Janet would occasionally return to be with Ken. In late 1976 Barker was asked to reprise the role for a final time. Janet returned on-screen in 1977 and asked Ken for another chance, claiming she had changed. When he rejects her, she commits suicide by taking an overdose. Barker recalled the "exhausting" scenes she and Roache filmed, and said there was substantial "dramatic [[Tracking shot|tracking]]" scenes as Ken discovered her dead in bed. Ken was described as "shattered" and "remorseful" by the death of Janet, and felt guilty over the fact he did not try to help her more. To worsen his situation, he was initially suspected of murdering her.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLittle|Little 1995]], pp.137–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deirdre Hunt====
In 1972, Deirdre Hunt, played by Anne Kirkbride, was introduced into ''Coronation Street''; the character would become synonymous with Ken's narrative when, in the early 1980s, Deirdre became Ken's third wife.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; A combined audience of 24 million viewers tuned in to see the nuptials.&lt;ref name="barlowwedding"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8179978/50-years-of-Corrie.html|title=50 years of Corrie|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|first=Harry|last=Wallop|date=4 December 2010|accessdate=1 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNovlQOj?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8179978/50-years-of-Corrie.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their wedding coincided with professional unease for actor Roache, who feared that Ken was becoming boring, to the detriment of his own self-confidence.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; In 2010 Roache said, "[Ken] was beginning to look very ordinary and quite nerdy, and that in turn had a knock-on effect for me, because I started to lose confidence as an actor. I went through a time where I was really scared of 'drying', which is not being able to remember your lines. You start to wonder about your own ability to remember lines and act in the way you had, which can be very damaging."&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;

Roache inferred that the writers no longer knew how to utilise Ken. Although he had rarely done so in the past, he voiced his concerns to the series' producer, dismayed that the character "seemed to be floating in a nebulous state". He believes that Ken was thereafter included in "much stronger stuff" as a result, including a storyline in which Deirdre had an affair with his rival, Mike Baldwin (Briggs).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline was devised in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.129.&lt;/ref&gt; Then producer Mervyn Watson recalls: "It was normal story conference and we looked at the Ken/Deirdre marriage and had the idea of her having an affair with somebody in the Street. It was extremely passionately debated because there were categorical and opposite view points expressed."&lt;ref name=watson/&gt; Watson believes that actors often feel "disturbed and uncomfortable" at the prospect of what their character will experience. In turn, he thought the scenario generated some of the best performances in the actors' careers. He concluded that Roache proved his theory correct, and praised his performance.&lt;ref name=watson&gt;[[#refLittle|Little 1995]], p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |width=20% |align=right |bgcolor=#cccfff |quote="The now famous 'love triangle showdown' scene on the doorstep on No.1 will always be my favourite. Ken's contempt for his wife, Deirdre, and her lover, Mike Baldwin, was at its most venomous, and I was given {{Sic|free rei|gn}} to vent my spleen&amp;nbsp;– so much so that even Anne Kirkbride didn't know how I was going to play the scene.

A now infamous scene, in which Ken comes face-to-face with Mike following the discovery of the affair and a showdown ensues, was originally scripted differently. Ken was intended to stand and meekly watch Mike and Deirdre chatting on his doorstep.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; Roache disliked this version, as he believed Ken's response lacked realism. Partly fuelled by his previous frustration with Ken's "lame" characterisation, Roache approached the episode's director, [[Brian Mills (television director)|Brian Mills]], and requested that Ken be allowed to hit Mike. Though the filming set-up planned for the scene did not allow for this, it was agreed that Ken would attempt to hit Mike, and that Deirdre would intervene.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.22–24&lt;/ref&gt; In the transmitted scene, Deirdre did intervene, resulting in Ken attempting to manhandle her. Roache recalls, "Every time I looked at the words and at what was supposed to happen I knew it just didn't ring true. Poor Annie wasn't prepared for what happened to her next and actually burst into tears because of the ferocity of my performance. She was shaken up by it, and when it came to the moment for Mike Baldwin to knock at the door she got an even bigger shock. After Baldwin asked why Deirdre had put the phone down when he'd called earlier, I slammed the door shut with my left hand and then slammed poor Annie against the door itself, leaving her shaken and shocked. She then made her way into the Barlows' living room, sobbing her heart out, and Brian left the cameras rolling, capturing [Anne's] genuine distress."&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;

The storyline was described as the most volatile and explosive in the programme's history.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; Roache recalls viewers taking it very seriously, to the point that he received letters reading: "Dear Ken, I though you should know that Mike Baldwin is seeing your wife!"&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.130&lt;/ref&gt; He related that, "When Deirdre decided to stop seeing Mike and stay with Ken, the scoreboard at [[Old Trafford]] on the night flashed the message that the couple were not splitting up to 56,000 football fans, amid thunderous cheers from the crowd!"&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; 20&amp;nbsp;million viewers tuned in for the episode; it attained the soap's second-highest recorded overnight ratings, surpassed only by the farewell episode of [[Hilda Ogden]] ([[Jean Alexander]]) in 1987.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ratings"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1334594_coronation_street_50_years_50_fascinating_facts_from_weatherfield|title=Coronation Street 50 Years: 50 fascinating facts from Weatherfield|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=1 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNozhhjM?url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1334594_coronation_street_50_years_50_fascinating_facts_from_weatherfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken and Deidre have been described as soap opera's version of [[Richard Burton]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]].&lt;ref name="barlows"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_headline=the-barlows---and-highs--&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=19030600&amp;siteid=66633-name_page.html|title=The Barlows ..and highs|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Brian|last=Mciver|date=2 May 2007|accessdate=1 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNp5OwKw?url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_headline%3Dthe-barlows---and-highs--%26method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D19030600%26siteid%3D66633-name_page.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship has featured various affairs, break-ups and reunions over the years. The couple's first marriage eventually disintegrated in the early 1990s, this time when Ken had an affair with colleague Wendy Crozier, a dalliance which ended in divorce for the Barlows. Ken was kicked out of home on New Year's Day 1990.&lt;ref name="barlows"/&gt; Their on/off relationship continued, with each having various other liaisons, until producers decided to reunite Ken and Deidre in 1999.&lt;ref name="barlows"/&gt; Roache said, "I was pleased. It seemed to fit perfectly with the lives that had been created for them throughout their time in ''Coronation Street''. They had both gone off and done very silly things and had had affairs with people, and yet their overriding need as they got older was for each other."&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; Ken and Deirdre's second marriage in 2005 was watched by an estimated 13 million viewers, compared to the nine million who watched the wedding of [[Prince Charles]] to [[Camilla Parker Bowles]] the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/apr/21/television.tvandradioarts1|title=Soap bubbles|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|first=Sarah|last=Ellis|date=21 April 2008|accessdate=3 June 2009&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJaPbwTP?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/apr/21/television.tvandradioarts1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, Ken and Deirdre's first wedding in 1981 was screened within 48 hours of Prince Charles and [[Princess Diana]]'s wedding, and just as in 2005, the Barlow wedding attracted more viewers than the royal wedding.&lt;ref name="barlowwedding"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2005/4/7/features/10599213&amp;sec=features |title=Double wedding in Britain |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |publisher=Star Publications |first=Choi |last=Tuck Wo |date=7 April 2005 |accessdate=1 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017222430/http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=%2F2005%2F4%2F7%2Ffeatures%2F10599213&amp;sec=features |archivedate=17 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roache has been complimentary about Ken and Deirdre, as well as Kirkbride—who, he states, he loves as much as Ken loves Deirdre—with this love explaining why Ken always ends up returning to her. Roache said, "We have been together on screen for pretty much 30 years now and so much of what we do on camera is instinctive. We really are like an old married couple who have had their ups and downs, lived through them and come out the other side."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a290831/bill-roache-praises-lovely-kirkbride.html|title=Bill Roache praises "lovely" Kirkbride|first=Ryan|last=Love|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|date=1 December 2010|accessdate=2 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNpCC1Xu?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a290831/bill-roache-praises-lovely-kirkbride.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denise Osbourne====
Ken was paired romantically with hairdresser [[Denise Osbourne]] ([[Denise Black]]) in 1994, the romance scuppering the chances of a reconciliation between recent divorcees Ken and Deirdre. Scriptwriters had actually been planning to reunite Ken and Deirdre, but when Deirdre's actress fell ill and had to be written out, the scripts were changed and Ken was paired with Denise instead.&lt;ref name="denise"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fans+stop+me+and+say+'You're+that+cow+Denise+from+the+Street'...+then...-a061157239|title=Fans stop me and say 'You're that cow Denise from the Street'|first=Jules|last=Stenson|work=[[The People]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=4 February 1996|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black has suggested that the romance came out of nowhere.&lt;ref name="denise"/&gt;

''The Official Coronation Street Annual 1997'' has described Ken and Denise as a "mis-matched pair" who were never destined to spend their lives together.&lt;ref name="Sharp"/&gt; In the storyline, Ken fathered Denise's son Daniel. They had an on/off relationship and a wedding was planned in 1996; however, in a plot twist, it was revealed to Ken that Denise, unable to  "hold her primitive lusts in check", was having an affair with her brother-in-law, Brian.&lt;ref name="sundaymail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Street+of+tears+as+Ken+loses+in+love+...-a061255016|title=Street of tears as Ken loses in love|work=[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=7 January 1996|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the discovery, Ken's happiness was snatched away in what has been described by ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'' as "harrowing circumstances", and one of the character's worst moments.&lt;ref name="sundaymail"/&gt; Denise Black has discussed her character's ambivalence towards her relationship with Ken, revealing why she believed Denise engaged in infidelity: "The thing is that she's in love with both men. When she's with Brian she loves him. And she's completely in love with Ken when he's with her. So she has two loves and all the guilt that goes along with that scenario. Denise doesn't mean to cause so much pain. Her problem is that she just doesn't know whether she's coming or going."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Record+Woman%3b+I+didn't+aim+to+hurt+Ken.-a061286232|title=Record Woman; I didn't aim to hurt Ken|first=John|last=Millar|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=17 January 1996|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Ken discovered the truth the wedding was called off, with Ken telling Denise to "get out before I kill you".&lt;ref name="denise"/&gt;

Following the revelation and amidst the fallout, Denise absconded, leaving her son in Ken's custody. This facilitated Black's desire to have a six-month break from the serial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/JILTED+KEN+IN+LOVE-TUG+BATTLE.-a061177153|title=Jilted Ken in love-tug battle|first=Paul|last=Byrne|work=[[The People]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=7 January 1996|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character returned in the winter of 1996, for the last part of her storyline, Black having decided to quit the role. Denise's return storyline was scripted to coincide with ''Coronation Street''{{'}}s increase to four weekly episodes. It focused upon a custody battle for Daniel between Ken and Denise after Denise snatched Daniel. A source at the time discussed the storyline and Ken's reaction to losing his son: "Ken is devastated when he returns home the week before Christmas and finds his son gone. He simply can't believe he's been snatched by the woman who dumped them. He immediately starts a custody battle. Denise plays heavily on the fact that she is the mother, while Ken [claims] that he is back in a relationship with his ex-wife Deirdre. Deirdre actually goes to court with him for support, but she gets angry when she finds out he tries to use their friendship as a lever to get Daniel back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/KEN'S+IN+TROUBLE+AGAIN...IT+MUST+BE+CHRISTMAS.-a061159089|title=Ken's in trouble again...It must be Christmas|first=Brian|last=Roberts|work=[[Sunday Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=29 September 1996|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Denise was awarded custody, she left ''Coronation Street'', and Ken lost contact with his son.

Denise was reintroduced for several months in 2007, over a decade after she had last appeared. Ken tracked down his son following marital unease with Deirdre, which led to interactions with Denise when he turned up unannounced for a visit. Black was pleased to be invited back, saying "I don’t think that you can have Ken Barlow’s baby and forget about it, can you?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/interviews/a46010/denise-black.html|title=Denise Black|first=Kris|last=Green|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|date=2 May 2007|accessdate=1 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNpK8iZL?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/interviews/a46010/denise-black.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denise's return was used as a catalyst to cause further problems in Ken and Deirdre's marriage, Ken having grown discontented. It was only a brief return; once Denise's advances towards Ken were rejected, Denise was written out again. Denise briefly returned in 2017 as part of [[Who Attacked Ken?]] as Daniel was the attacker.

====Martha Fraser====
In January 2009, [[Martha Fraser]] (played by [[Stephanie Beacham]]), a new love interest for Ken, was introduced to the show.&lt;ref name="DSMF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a136922/stephanie-beacham-joins-corrie.html%7Clast=Green%7Cfirst=Kris|title=Stephanie Beacham joins Corrie|date=27 November 2008|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=8 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJaWKgaj?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a136922/stephanie-beacham-joins-corrie.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken meets Martha by the canal while he is walking his dog, Eccles.

He enjoys telling Martha about his problems, his son and his grandchildren, as she is not judgmental.&lt;ref name="KenCheatAgain"/&gt; When asked if Ken mentions Deirdre, Roache said "Er... no.

A few more would be great. I've lost count of romances I've had in the show, not to mention the four weddings."&lt;ref name="MoreLoveTwists"/&gt; Ken and Martha's romance was later depicted in the ''Coronation Street'' musical, ''[[Corrie!]]''. Ben East of ''[[The Stage]]'' said the romance was "genuinely funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/29294/corrie-|title=Corrie!|last=East|first=Ben|date=17 August 2010|work=[[The Stage]]|publisher=The Stage Newspaper Limited|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other relationships====
Ken's first on-screen relationship was with Susan Cunningham (Shakesby), whom he dated throughout the first ten episodes. Ashamed of his family and background, Ken was constantly apologising to her. This frustrated Susan, who actually liked Coronation Street.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty years later, it transpired that their relationship had left Susan pregnant, resulting in the birth of a son, Lawrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.list.co.uk/article/28837-bill-roaches-family-dream/|title=Bill Roache's family dream|date=24 August 2010|work=[[The List (magazine)|The List]]|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Susan, Ken's early love interests included [[Marian Lund]] (Patricia Heneghan), a librarian eleven years his senior; Yvonne Chappell (Alex Marshall), a hotel receptionist he met en route to first wife Valerie's funeral; [[Norma Ford]] ([[Diana Davies (actress)|Diana Davies]]), an impressionable young shop-assistant;&lt;ref name="P118"/&gt; Wendy Nightingale (Susan Tebbs), a married woman who moved in with Ken, making them ''Coronation Street''{{'}}s first unmarried cohabiting couple;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEgan|Egan 2010]], pp.138–139.&lt;/ref&gt; and Elaine.&lt;ref name="P118"&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.118–122.&lt;/ref&gt; Roache believes that Ken was in love with Elaine, though her feelings for him were less intense. He recalls some discussion of re-introducing her to the series in 2009; however, this did not come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.121.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon separating from Elaine, Ken confided in his friend Rita (Knox) that, "There were other fellers more glamorous, more successful, more wealthy and more interesting than me." According to Roache, the line offers insight into Ken's psyche, evidencing that he truly belongs on Coronation Street, despite his desires to the contrary.&lt;ref name="P122"&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the number of romances Ken was involved in declined from the 1980s onwards, Roache states that those relationships he did have "tended to be bigger and more involved".&lt;ref name="P122"/&gt; His later love interests included Wendy Crozier (Kerr), Alma Sedgewick (Barrie) and Maggie Redman (Kerman).&lt;ref name="P118"/&gt;

===Family===
[[File:Chris Gascoyne.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Chris Gascoyne plays Ken's son Peter Barlow]]Ken was disdainful of his parents, Frank (Pemberton) and Ida (Dyson).&lt;ref name="P15"/&gt; Their strained familial relationship was apparent from his very first scene, in which conflict arose over his reluctance to eat a meal with brown sauce. Roache called it "good character-defining stuff", which established the antagonism between Ken and his father, borne from Ken's snobbery and desire to abandon his roots.&lt;ref name="Sauce"&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.53.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of his mother further illuminated the father-son relationship. Roache recalls that, "although their relationship could often be stormy, with Ken's views and attitude rubbing Frank up the wrong way on a number of issues, the fact was that they had been thrown together by her death and they had to get used to living with each other without the buffer that Ida had often provided."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; While Dyson left the series under her own volition, Pemberton later became one of several cast members fired under Aspinall's tenure as producer. By 1984, both of Ken's parents had left the Street.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.75–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Ken was originally intended to have a sister named Enid. Warren decided against her inclusion, and instead created a younger brother, professional footballer David (Rothwell),&lt;ref name="fiftyfacts"&gt;{{cite web|last=Oglethorpe|first=Tim|title=Coronation Street: 124 deaths (including 16 murders), 86 marriages, 52 barmaids&amp;nbsp;– 'ey oop chuck, it's 50 years of Corrie|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1308570/Coronation-Street-50th-birthday-124-deaths-86-marriages-52-barmaids.html|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[Associated Newspapers]])|accessdate=8 May 2011|date=3 September 2010&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yXEaEoCe?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1308570/Coronation-Street-50th-birthday-124-deaths-86-marriages-52-barmaids.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; to enable the show to represent teenage males.&lt;ref name="P15"&gt;[[#refEgan|Egan 2010]], pp.15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Rothwell feels that an "underlying antagonism" existed between Ken and David, which stemmed from the fact Ken had the advantage of a university education, while his brother did not.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEgan|Egan 2010]], p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken was bored with looking after the children, Peter and Susan, before Valerie's death. Afterwards, further problems occurred and Ken was no longer able to cope.&lt;ref name=scotsman/&gt; The writers were initially uncertain whether to continue with Ken as a single father, or dispatch the children and pursue a less-encumbered lifestyle.&lt;ref name="P107"&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.107&lt;/ref&gt; Roache said, "Ken tried to bring up the kids on his own, but he wasn't doing so good. So he sent them up to Glasgow to live with his mother-in-law." Ken still remained in contact; Roache recalled Ken often saying: "Right, I'm off to Scotland.'"&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramaswamy|first=Chitra|title=Interview: Coronation Street's Ken Barlow, aka William Roache|url=http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment/Interview-Coronation-Streets-Ken-Barlow.6650744.jp?articlepage=2|work=[[The Scotsman]]|publisher=([[Johnston Press]])|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=7 December 2010&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yKdDL8AM?url=http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment/Interview-Coronation-Streets-Ken-Barlow.6650744.jp?articlepage%3D2--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roache has suggested that the subsequent problems in his children's adulthood were Ken's fault: "I blame Ken for how they've all turned out. He shoved his kids up in Scotland, didn't really look after them. But you don't want a happy family in the Street. You want a wonderful dysfunctional one like the one I've got, they're great and Deirdre is wonderful."&lt;ref name="thisisnottingham"/&gt; The animosity between Ken and his children has been explored throughout the programme's duration. [[Chris Gascoyne]], who took on the role of Peter in the 2000s, has suggested that there is a lot of tension between Ken and Peter due to the dysfunctional nature of the Barlow family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Barlow a bad dad?

Their close relationship resulted in Roache challenging the series producers when a script required Ken to allow Daniel to be taken away by his mother. The actor felt that Ken would not accept this; he would fight. The scriptwriters apologised, but it was too late to re-write the plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.189–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Valerie's death, Ken became responsible for looking after her uncle, Albert, and he later became known as Ken's "Uncle Albert".&lt;ref name=uncc&gt;{{cite web|title=Holland's Pies create Coronation Street-themed products|url=http://www.blackburncitizen.co.uk/news/7985140.Holland_s_Pies_create_Coronation_Street_themed_products/|work=Chorley Citizen|publisher=([[Newsquest]])|accessdate=8 May 2011|date=5 April 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yWnWjnsx?url=http://www.blackburncitizen.co.uk/news/7985140.Holland_s_Pies_create_Coronation_Street_themed_products/|dead-url=no|archivedate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert would often make attempts to interfere in Ken's life, as he had no one else. At one stage, Ken was making plans to leave Weatherfield. When Albert revealed he could not pay his bills on his pension, Ken opted to stay. The storyline has been called a turning point for Ken—when he realised he belonged in ''Coronation Street'' and had to help the community and Albert alike.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLittle|Little 1995]], p.130.&lt;/ref&gt; Ken moved in with him and Albert gradually saw Ken as "the son he never had".&lt;ref name=vmeds&gt;{{cite web|title=The original Coronation Street cast|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/top-tv-shows/coronation-street/original-corrie-cast.php?ssid=4|work=[[Virgin Media]]|accessdate=8 May 2011|year=2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yWt5KHRR?url=http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/top-tv-shows/coronation-street/original-corrie-cast.php?ssid%3D4|dead-url=no|archivedate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roache enjoyed the opportunity to work closely with Howarth, whom he first met as a schoolboy. He characterised Ken and Albert's relationship as "often a little bumpy and uncomfortable, but underlying all of that was an affection the two had for each other."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.128.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feud with Mike Baldwin===
Television researcher Helena Robson has discussed the appeal of soap operas and suggested that "many soap stories are never finally resolved and conflicts between characters may run throughout the programme's history". She used the "undying hatred" between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) as an example of this, suggesting that viewers "welcome the sense of stability this offers although the element of change offers as much enjoyment for viewers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why are soap operas so popular? |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Students/hlr9501.html |first=Helena |last=Robson |work=[[Daily Mail]] |publisher=([[Associated Newspapers]]) |accessdate=30 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316142905/http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Students/hlr9501.html |archivedate=16 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested in an ITV documentary in 2006 that Ken and Mike's hatred was a clash of cultures: "Barlow the lefty do-gooder versus Baldwin, the cut-and-thrust money grabber."&lt;ref name="farewell"&gt;{{Cite episode| title = Farewell Mike| serieslink =Coronation Street| credits =| network = ITV| airdate = 7 April 2006| time = 20:00}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briggs has claimed that Ken was jealous of Mike because he was rich and successful while Ken was not, and Roache has claimed that the reason Ken disliked Mike was because he was a self-centred and self-made individual.&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt;

[[File:Old Trafford inside 20060726 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Old Trafford]] football ground. During the Ken-Mike-Deirdre love triangle in 1983, fans watching the match were informed that Deirdre was staying with Ken. The scoreboard flashed "Ken 1, Mike 0".]]
Ken's feud with Mike—spanning over 20 years—began in 1983, when Ken discovered that his wife, Deirdre, was having an affair with Baldwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baldwin to die in arms of Street rival|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-377734/Baldwin-die-arms-Street-rival.html|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[Associated Newspapers]])|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=20 February 2006&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPCUW6iO?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-377734/Baldwin-die-arms-Street-rival.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; His dislike for Mike pre-dated the affair, however, and Roache has stated:

{{quote|text="The truth was that Ken never liked him, but having his wife go off and have an affair with Mike turned dislike into hatred, which was wonderful for the programme. Just the mention of Baldwin's name was enough to get Ken twitching with barely contained anger, and for Johnny Briggs and me it was absolutely wonderful. At best the two characters sometimes tolerated each other in an uneasy truce, but at worst the two of them not only threw insults at each other, but punches too. It was a relationship that ran for many years, and although towards the end of Mike Baldwin's time on the show you might say there was a little mellowing going on, it was never a relationship that was going to be anything other than uneasy."|sign=William Roache|source=''50 Years on the Street''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.135.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Of the love triangle storyline, Briggs has said, "the way it captured the nation was amazing. Everyone was talking about it and the pubs were empty. Men were shouting out: 'Go on Mike, give her one.' People were disappointed when she went back to Ken".&lt;ref name="feud"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mike's top 20 moments|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16846346&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=66633&amp;headline=mike-s-top-20-moments--name_page.html|first=Claire|last=Donnelly|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=22 March 2006|archiveurl=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MIKE%27S+TOP+20+MOMENTS%3B+EXCLUSIVE%3A+DAY+THREE+OF+THE+JOHNNY+BRIGGS...-a0143508294|archivedate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline had significant cultural impact, with the press claiming that the country was divided between those who thought Deirdre should remain with Ken, and those who thought she should leave with Mike.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refC4|Hobson 2008]], p.46.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2003 book, Hobson suggested that Ken "spent at least nineteen years unable to cope with the sense of rejection and betrayal" caused by Mike and Deirdre's affair.&lt;ref name="Hobson129"/&gt;

Scriptwriters capitalised on the rivalry between the characters when, in 1986, Mike married Ken's daughter Susan, a union that Ken strongly opposed.&lt;ref name="feud"/&gt; Numerous fights between Ken and Mike were featured, and Briggs has suggested that they became famous for their brawls. The first fight between the pair occurred in 1986, when Ken confronted Mike in his factory about Mike's maltreatment of his daughter.&lt;ref name="feud"/&gt; Of the confrontation, Briggs has said, "It was a classic&amp;nbsp;– Baldwin getting it in his own territory, the factory. It took a lot to get Ken angry but after the way Mike had treated his daughter, he was furious. He marched into the office and let him have it. This was one of those rare times he caught Mike off-guard."&lt;ref name="feud"/&gt; Mike was shown to get revenge on Ken, though it took a further four years before he could do so on-screen. In a scene which aired in 1990, Mike punched Ken, knocking him over a table in the Rovers Return public house.&lt;ref name="feud"/&gt; Briggs has suggested that he and Roache became old hands at doing on-screen fistfights, and that both really enjoyed doing the stunts. According to Briggs, no choreographers were ever used. In 1998 one incident left Briggs with an injury after he fell backwards.&lt;ref name="feud"/&gt;

Ken and Mike were forced to work together in 2000, when they were featured in a storyline dubbed the "Freshco siege".&lt;ref name="siege"&gt;{{cite web|title=Street siege's soul survivors.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/LAST+NIGHT'S+VIEW+%3a+Street+siege's+soul+survivors.-a066000093|first=Claire|last=Donnelly|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=12 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken and Mike were among several series regulars held up at gunpoint in the soap's local supermarket, where Ken had been working as a trolley pusher. The episode was broadcast after the 9 pm watershed due to its depiction of violence. Ken and Mike were bound together by armed robbers, which facilitated an end to their feud; Ken helped Mike to combat a [[panic attack]].&lt;ref name="siege"/&gt; The pair resolved to put the past behind them; it was a temporary reprieve. Mike had unknowingly fathered a son, Adam, during his brief marriage to Susan Barlow; she kept the baby a secret from him. Mike discovered Adam's existence in 2001; Susan attempted to flee, but was killed in a motor accident. Then followed a battle between Mike and Ken for custody of Adam, with Ken adamant that Mike should not look after his grandson. The storyline lead to the fifth fistfight between Ken and Mike in the soap's history, with the pair brawling at the funeral of Susan.&lt;ref name="adam"&gt;{{cite web|title=CUSTODY STREET; Ken and Mike fight for orphan Adam.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/CUSTODY+STREET%3b+Ken+and+Mike+fight+for+orphan+Adam.-a069369899|first=Claire|last=Donnelly|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=22 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feud came to an end on-screen in 2006, when Briggs quit the role of Mike. Mike was killed off, dying of [[Alzheimer's disease]]; he died in Ken's arms. In the final scenes, a disorientated and dying Mike was found wandering the streets by Ken, and as Ken cradled Mike in his arms, the rivals talked about old times before Mike died, signifying the end of their 20-year feud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baldwin to die in arms of Street rival|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/205062_baldwin_to_die_in_arms_of_street_rival|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|date=20 February 2006|accessdate=22 April 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPbAHkmJ?url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/205062_baldwin_to_die_in_arms_of_street_rival|dead-url=no|archivedate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To promote Mike's final scenes, ''[[Radio Times]]'' released a series of photographs with Ken and Mike re-enacting [[Arthur William Devis|Arthur Devis]]'s (1807) [[The Death of Nelson, 21 October 1805|painting]] of the death of [[Horatio Nelson]]—Baldwin was shown surrounded by his nearest and dearest during his final moments, with Ken prominently positioned next to him, taking on the role of [[Captain Hardy]], Nelson's trusted colleague to whom Nelson famously uttered "Kiss me" before he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kiss me Barlow|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-381255/Kiss-Barlow.html|first=Tom|last=Bryant|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[Associated Newspapers]])|date=28 March 2006|accessdate=22 April 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPb5Liae?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-381255/Kiss-Barlow.html|dead-url=no|archivedate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer Maire Tracey said, "The fact that Mike dies in Ken's arms says it all. For most of Mike's life, it was his battles with Ken that kept him going. Like two cowboys, they spent their lives sizing each other up. Behind the scenes Bill Roache has even suggested to Johnny Briggs that they should make a version of ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' for the two elderly cowboys. Both Ken and Mike will miss the bust-ups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johnny's long goodbye to Mike Baldwin|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Johnny's+long+goodbye+to+Mike+Baldwin%3b+Television+IT'S+bye-bye+Johnny...-a0143950729|first=Marion|last=McMullen|work=[[Coventry Evening Telegraph]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|date=1 April 2006|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on the feud in 2006, Roache gave reasons why he thinks Ken and Mike clashed so often: "Ken felt threatened when Mike arrived on the street, but it made the part more exciting for Bill. Ken is a nice guy, a loyal guy, a reliable guy. But he isn't terribly exciting. So the exciting guy [Mike] comes along and he's a bit flash, isn't he? But I've always liked the physical side of acting, so my punch-ups with Johnny were probably the best bits. I shall miss those terribly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drama: Bald truth as Street's stars reveal all|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DRAMA%3a+Bald+truth+as+Street's+stars+reveal+all...+NEW!+FAREWELL+MIKE...-a0143937139|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|date=1 April 2006|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Who Attacked Ken?===
{{Main|Who Attacked Ken?}}
In March 2017, Ken was at the centre of a "[[whodunit]]" storyline which saw an unknown assailant push him down the stairs of his house after striking him over the head with a blunt object.

In February 2011 Ken was among various ''Coronation Street'' characters to have his portrait auctioned for charity in the exhibition 'Behind the Street' at Manchester's Generation Pop Gallery. The black-and-white shots were taken by photographer Rob Evans, and raised £8,600 for charity. The highest bid on a photograph was for a shot of Ken, standing amongst rubble after the Weatherfield tram crash in 2010, a storyline marking the show's 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a304699/corrie-portraits-go-under-the-hammer.html|title=Corrie portraits go under the hammer|date=19 February 2011|first=Sophie|last=Hines|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=2 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNpWkH6z?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a304699/corrie-portraits-go-under-the-hammer.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 ITV began selling ''Coronation Street'' merchandise featuring Ken, including gift wrap&lt;ref name=shop&gt;{{cite web|title=Coronation Street Character Gift Wrap&amp;nbsp;– ITV Store |url=http://shop.itv.com/detail.php?p=275840 |work=[[itv.com]] |publisher=([[ITV Plc]]) |accessdate=2 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719190356/http://shop.itv.com/detail.php?p=275840 |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and novelty congratulations cards.&lt;ref name=shopper&gt;{{cite web|title=Ken &amp; Deidre' Congratulations Novelty Card&amp;nbsp;– Coronation Street&amp;nbsp;– ITV Store |url=http://shop.itv.com/detail.php?p=275810 |work=[[itv.com]] |publisher=([[ITV Plc]]) |accessdate=2 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719190430/http://shop.itv.com/detail.php?p=275810 |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He felt that it may be a common assumption that Roache is merely playing himself on-screen; this notion diminishes a "rather remarkable acting performance". He added, "although the bouquets tend to go to actors who repeatedly display their versatility, it is in many ways even harder to inhabit one role for five decades. That said, for sheer staying power Ken and Bill are clearly indivisible: one has lived in the same street practically all his life, the other in the same role [...]. That we have been able to watch the evolution of that young man into the Ken Barlow we know today, no less self-righteous but with 50 years of experiences behind him, is frankly one of the wonders of British television."&lt;ref name="indepen"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/william-roache-the-role-of-a-lifetime-2150841.html|title=William Roache: The role of a lifetime|work=[[The Independent]]|date=4 December 2010|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken has a reputation for being boring.&lt;ref name="indepen"/&gt; The British band [[Half Man Half Biscuit]] highlighted this point in their 2001 song "Lark Descending", comparing Ken Barlow infavourably with a member of the US underground music scene, with the lyric: "I could have been like [[Lou Barlow]], but I'm more like Ken Barlow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes| title = Editor's recommendation| others = Half Man Half Biscuit| year = 2001| type= CD| publisher   = Probeplus | id = PP32CD| location = UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Ken being fictional, critic [[Jim Shelley (TV critic)|Jim Shelley]] writing for the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' in 2009 labelled Ken "the most boring man you could ever meet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-199512466.html|title=Boring Barlow's pulling power is beyond our Ken.|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Jim|last=Shelley|date=11 May 2009|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roache sued for libel in 1990 when ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper ran an article branding Ken boring and making allegations that Roache was disliked among the cast of ''Coronation Street''.&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/apr/14/features11.g2?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Bankrupt... but by no means boring|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|first= Fiachra|last=Gibbons|date=14 April 1999|accessdate=1 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yMXwNXjY?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/1999/apr/14/features11.g2?INTCMP%3DSRCH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roache said to the jury at the court case, "I felt extremely distressed. I could not believe those words had been written, that they had raked into my past. I broke out in a sweat. [...] They were saying that I was not doing my job, that I was a joke to the storyline writers, which is not true". Roache added in regard to Ken, "If people find someone who has had 23 girlfriends and three wives boring, that's fine by me."&lt;ref name="trial"/&gt; Roache won the case and was awarded £50,000; however, he was forced to pay legal costs, which bankrupted him.&lt;ref name="trial"/&gt; Brian Viner has suggested that it is remarkable that Ken has been labelled boring in spite of the many plots he has been involved with over the years. Brian Viner said, "It is easy enough to see, despite the extraordinary number of broken relationships and personal crises in his wake, why Ken tends not to make the pulse race when he opens his mouth. After all, he usually opens it only to drink halves of bitter, or to say something sensible or worthy. For 50 years he has been the nearest thing Weatherfield, the fictional area of Greater Manchester where Coronation Street is located, has had to a social conscience."&lt;ref name="indepen"/&gt;

In a [[Channel 4]] televised poll that was broadcast in 2001, Ken Barlow was voted the third most-hated TV character of all time, coming behind [[Phil Mitchell]] from ''EastEnders'' and [[Mr Blobby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|url=http://www.classictv.info/survey/characters/| title = 100 Greatest TV Characters | accessdate =3 May 2011| series = 100 Greatest/100 Worst | serieslink = 100 Greatest/100 Worst | network = [[Channel 4]]| airdate =2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[Radio Times]]'' poll of over 5,000 people in 2004, 15% chose Ken as the soap character they would most like to see retired. He came second in the poll, behind ''EastEnders''' [[Den Watts]] (17%).&lt;ref name="retiredpoll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/123/123791_hilda_ogden_voted_the_best.html|title=Hilda Ogden voted the best|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|date=13 July 2004|accessdate=10 September 2007|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPD9r7sx?url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/123/123791_hilda_ogden_voted_the_best.html|dead-url=no|archivedate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television personality [[Paul O'Grady]] wrote the foreword to Roache's 2010 autobiography, ''50 Years on the Street''. In it, he hailed Ken as "one of the iconic British soap characters", an all-time great who has been integral to ''Coronation Street''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.11–13&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Grace Dent]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' suggested that ''Coronation Street'' archetypes have influenced latter soap opera characters. On Ken, she stated: "another heavily plagiarised ''Corrie'' stalwart is Ken Barlow, who as 'resident intellectual' has been looking down his nose at the proletariat since 1960. Just like poor hangdog-faced Ken, brainy people in soapland ([[Anthony Trueman|Dr Truman]] [from ''[[EastEnders]]''], [[Roy Cropper]], [[Todd Grimshaw]] [both from ''Coronation Street''], ''[[Emmerdale]]'s'' [[Ethan Blake|Ethan]] the curate) are always miserable and brooding, due to the terrible burden of their mighty intellect in the face of so many simpletons. It rarely pays to be too clever or too rich in soapland as the majority of plotlines rely upon tragic Shakespearian falls from grace which everyone laughs their socks off at."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jul/30/tvandradio.theguide|title=Crowned with glory|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|first=Grace|last=Dent|date=30 July 2005|accessdate=3 June 2009&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yMYC4Y0r?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/jul/30/tvandradio.theguide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, viewers complained to ITV as well as the media regulator [[Ofcom]] after ''Coronation Street'' broadcast scenes in which Ken made derogatory comments about [[Christianity]]. A spokesperson for the show defended the opinions expressed by Ken in the scripts, saying, "''Coronation Street'' is a soap opera set in modern society and therefore represents views from all side of the religious spectrum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a152724/corrie-kens-remarks-spark-complaints.html|title=Corrie Ken's remarks spark complaints|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=14 April 2009|accessdate=3 June 2009&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJbAvxZA?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a152724/corrie-kens-remarks-spark-complaints.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' columnist [[Nancy Banks-Smith]] spoke highly of Ken's affair with Martha Fraser in 2009, calling it "a muted ingenious storyline".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/may/09/last-nights-tv-coronation-street|title=Last night's TV: Coronation Street|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|first=Nancy|last=Banks-Smith|date=9 May 2009|accessdate=29 September 2010&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJbCakOA?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/may/09/last-nights-tv-coronation-street--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gareth McLean of the ''[[Radio Times]]'' was critical of the storyline: "When it comes to self-delusion, Ken takes the biscuit, claims the cake and wolfs down the éclair.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3517">'''Komafest''' (Norwegian: Coma party) was an [[urban art]] and [[graffiti]] event organized in [[Vardø]], Norway. Tens of mostly abandoned buildings were decorated by international artists in the period 5–21 July 2012, culminating in a grand opening and a guided town tour attended by hundreds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnmarken.no/lokale_nyheter/article6159982.ece] Finnmarken: Fiskerens gudinne ble til kunst&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was curated by noted Norwegian urban artist "[[Pøbel]]". Participating artists were [[Steve Powers (artist)|Stephen Powers]] (United States), "[[Vhils]]" ([[Portugal]]), "[[ROA (artist)|Roa]]" (Belgium), Atle Østrem (Norway), "Ethos" ([[Brazil]]), "E. B. Itso", "Husk mit navn" (both Denmark), "Horfe", Ken Sortais, "Remed" (all France) and Conor Harrington (Ireland).

==Background==

Vardø is Norway's north-easternmost town. Traditionally a vibrant fishing community, the town's population halved between the 1960s and 2000s. As per 2012, depopulation had balanced out and Vardø had 2,122 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssb.no/emner/02/02/folkendrhist/tabeller/tab/2002.html] Statistics Norway (''Statistisk sentralbyrå'')&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the population decline, Vardø was left with many empty buildings in various stages of disrepair. "Pøbel" wanted to organize a larger scale continuation of the "Getto spedalsk" ("Ghetto leperous") project, where he and collaborator "[[DOLK (artist)|Dolk]]" painted abandoned buildings in at the [[Lofoten islands]].

After securing the cooperation of local developers in spring 2012, the project started getting permission from individual property owners to decorate buildings. The name "Komafest" plays on the notion of the houses being roused from their sleep by the activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnmarken.no/lokale_nyheter/article6124905.ece] Finnmarken: Tar street art til verdens ende&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Moving bus Vardø komafest.jpg|thumb|right|Vardø mayor Lasse Haughom ([[Progress Party (Norway)|FRP)]] beside the moving-bus installation]] --&gt;

==The festival==

Although substantial financing had been secured from, among others, the Northern Norway Artists' Centre, much of the daily activity relied on volunteer work and free use of privately owned heavy equipment, including lifts and cranes. "Pøbel" himself insisted the festival was as much about the locals and the town as it was the art, saying he hoped that the festival would be a catalyst for renovation and increased enthusiasm for local history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/troms_og_finnmark/1.8241059] NRK: I denne byen har Pøbel frie tøyler&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, the 100-year-old municipal cinema, closed for over 20 years and used as a warehouse, was cleared and used to host a lecture by author Tristan Manco and screen street art films.

After the opening weekend, the festival secured financing, equipment and political permission to realise the long-planned idea of planting an old bus next to the underwater tunnel that leads to Vardø. The bus was previously used to transport families and their belongings out of Vardø during the era of mass de-population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finnmarken.no/kulturliv/article6164378.ece] Finnmarken: Setter punktum for Vardøs fraflytting&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lalit Kala Akademi''' or '''National Academy of Art''' is [[India]]'s [[national academy]] of [[fine arts]]. It is an autonomous organisation, established in [[New Delhi]] in 1954 by [[Government of India]] to promote and propagate understanding of [[Indian art]], in and outside the country.

LKA provides scholarships and a fellow program, and sponsors and organises exhibitions in India and overseas. It publishes a bilingual journal. It is funded by the Union [[Ministry of Culture (India)|Ministry of Culture]]. Its headquarters are at Ravindra Bhawan, Ferozshah Road, New Delhi. In April 2015, [[Government of India]] took over management control of Lalit Kala Akademi citing complaints regarding alleged administrative and financial irregularities in its functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/govt-takes-over-lalit-kala-akademi-s-management-115040601123_1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chairman==
[[File:Lalit Kala Gallery, Delhi.jpg|thumb|Lalit Kala Gallery, in the Rabindra Bhawan complex, Delhi]]
* On May 17, 2018 Honorable President [[Ram Nath Kovind]] has appointed [[Uttam Pacharne]], an Artist, and sculptor as chairman of the Lalit Kala Akademi. He is a member of the advisory committee, Kala Academy, Goa and member of advisory committee, P L Deshpande State Lalit Kala Academy and director, Janseva Sahakari Bank, Borivali, [[Mumbai]]. He would hold office for a term of three years from the date on which he assumes charge.  He is the recipient of National Lalit Kala Award 1985, Maharashtra Gaurav Puraska 1985 from Government of Maharashtra, Junior National Award 1986 and Jeevan Gaurav Puraskar 2017 from Prafulla Dahanukar Foundation. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chairman |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/may/17/artist-uttam-pacharne-appointed-lalit-kala-akademi-chairman-1815980.html |publisher=[[The New Indian Express]] |date=May 17, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In March, President Ram Nath Kovind appointed M.L. Srivastava, joint secretary (Academies) at the Ministry of Culture, as the pro-tem chairman of the Lalit Kala Akademi.

* Since the current Government has taken over, former Chairman of Karnataka Lalit Kala Academy CS Krishna Setty, a well-known artist, and art critic is heading LKA as Administrator. He was charged with misappropriation of funds. So, in mid-2017, the ministry had instituted a three-member inquiry committee to probe some allegations of misuse of finances against Setty. Later, this order was withdrawn on August 16, 2017. The Delhi high court, which has been hearing a PIL alleging misappropriation of funds at the national arts body, had sought an explanation from the ministry on August 24, 2017, about it. However, the ministry hasn't replied. The next date of hearing of the case was May 8. So, the ministry finally decided to let Setty go in the first week of April 2018, after the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), in 2017, took note of repeated complaints, including missing artworks of the celebrated painter M.F. Husain from the Akademi. But in a reply to a newspaper, He said, "M.F. Husain’s work disappeared (from the Lalit Kala Akademi) long ago. It didn’t happen in my tenure and so I am not connected to it". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lalit Kala Akademi |url=https://thewire.in/the-arts/culture-ministry-raised-former-lalit-kala-akademi-heads-salary-days-before-sacking.html |publisher=[[The Wire]] |date=May 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mălâncrav is a village in Laslea commune. An asphalt road of 13&amp;nbsp;km leads to the village. In the village there is a small community of [[Transylvanian Saxon]]s.

Here some of the most significant [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[mural]]s in [[Transylvania]] aside from those at [[Ghelința]] in [[Covasna County]] are found.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The Saxon [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church has early 14th-century Gothic murals in the [[apse]]. 15th-century ones are found in the [[nave]] and a 15th-century late Gothic [[altar]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In later centuries the Apafi family (Hungarian nobles in Transylvania) buried their dead in the church since they had overlordship in the village. Although the sarcophagi were removed (one of [[Mihaly Apafi]] is now in [[Budapest]]'s [[Hungarian National Museum]]). The locality was not part of the autonomous Saxon territory Although until the 1970s when it was populated by Germans.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

==Prince of Wales and sustainable tourism==
In 2006, The [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] bought and restored two 18th century [[Transylvanian Saxon]] houses in the villages of Mălâncrav and [[Viscri]] to help protect the unique way of life that has existed for hundreds of years and promote [[sustainable tourism]].

The buildings have been sensitively restored and converted into guesthouses for tourists. They remain in keeping with the surrounding architecture and feature a number of Transylvanian antiques but with modern facilities where possible.

The renovation of these buildings has helped provide a sustainable future for the people of rural Transylvania while also enabling residents to maintain their traditional way of life.

The [[Norse mythology]], preserved in such ancient [[Iceland]]ic texts as the [[Poetic Edda]], the [[Prose Edda]], and other lays and sagas, was little known outside [[Scandinavia]] until the 19th century. With the widespread publication of Norse myths and legends at this time, references to the Norse gods and heroes spread into European literary culture, especially in Scandinavia, Germany, and Britain. In the later 20th century, references to Norse mythology became common in science fiction and fantasy literature, role-playing games, and eventually other cultural products such as Japanese animation.

==Reintroduction to popular culture==
Antiquaries of the 19th century such as [[George Webbe Dasent]] brought the mythology of Scandinavia back to the popular notice of many people in Germany and England; in both cases, Norse mythology was recognized as the latest surviving form of [[Germanic paganism]]. Germany and England were Christianized far earlier than the Scandinavian countries and much of their own traditions were lost.

In Britain, [[William Morris]] composed poetry such as ''[[The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs|Sigurd the Volsung]]'' on Norse legendary subjects as well as translating Icelandic sagas into English. In Germany, [[Richard Wagner]] borrowed characters and themes from Norse mythology to compose the four operas that make up ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' (''The Ring of the Nibelung''), though he also utilized medieval German sources and Germanized the names of the Norse gods.

==Depictions in modern popular culture==

===Comics===

====American comics====
*In the [[Marvel Universe]], the Norse [[wiktionary:Pantheon|Pantheon]] and related elements play a prominent part, especially [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who has been one of the longest-running [[superhero]]es for the company and has had a starring role in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', the movie based on the comic books. Also, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] (Thor's adopted brother in this version) is one of the most prominent villains in the Marvel Universe, serving as one of the main antagonists in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] franchise.
*[[Odin]], [[Thor]], [[Loki]], and several other beings and places in Norse mythology have recurring roles in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Sandman]]'' graphic novel series, most notably in the ''[[The Sandman: Season of Mists|Season of Mists]]'' and ''[[The Sandman: The Kindly Ones|The Kindly Ones]]'' stories.
**''[[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]]'', being a ''Sandman''-spinoff, continues this trend, having [[Loki]] and [[Sigyn]] appear briefly. [[Bergelmir]], [[Yggdrasil]] and [[Naglfar]] have prominent roles, and [[Fenrir|Fenris]] is a major antagonist.
*The American graphic novel ''Gods of Asgard'' by [[Erik Evensen]] is an adaptation of several of the Norse myths. ''Gods of Asgard'' was awarded a [[List of Xeric grant winners#2007|Xeric grant]] in 2007.

===Literature===
&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD WRITERS ONLY IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER OF PUBLICATION, BY DATE --&gt;
*Stephanie Edgley of the ''[[Skulduggery Pleasant]]'' novel series took up the name Valkyrie Cain, based on the creature the Valkeryie.
*The Victorian adventure writer [[H. Rider Haggard]] wrote an epic adventure in the style of the Nordic sagas, ''[[Eric Brighteyes]]'' (1890).
*Various Norse gods are referenced in the book ''[[The Ballad of the White Horse]]'' (1911) by [[G. K. Chesterton]]. [[Odin]] and [[Thor]] are portrayed there in a negative light. The ballad portrays [[Catholicism]] as the true religion and the Norse religion as pagan.
*In the novel, ''[[The Incomplete Enchanter]]'' (1941) by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and Fletcher Pratt, the protagonist finds himself in Asgard, where he allies himself with the [[Æsir]] as Ragnarök approaches.
*''[[The Broken Sword]]'' (1954) by [[Poul Anderson]] is inspired by Norse sagas, and feature numerous Norse gods, elves and trolls as characters. Later, in ''The Sorrow of Odin the Goth'', part of his ''Time Patrol'' series, Anderson suggested that Odin was originally a 20th-century American [[time travel]]er who visited several generations of early the wandering [[Goths]] ‒ who started to regard him as a god, later influencing other Germanic peoples.
*''The Day of the Giants'' (1959) by [[Lester del Rey]] tells the tale of [[Ragnarok]] happening in a near future science fiction setting, with an erstwhile engineer arming the Norse Gods with modern weaponry.
*The Argentinian writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] have mentioned various Norse gods along his life work, as he did in the short story [[:es:Ulrica|Ulrica]] and the poem titled A wolf (Un Lobo). Also, he was buried in Geneva and his gravestone has inscriptions written in old English and Old Norse. The figures drawn on it were inspired from the Völsunga Saga and the  Anglo-Saxon Battle of Maldon. 
*[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy works'' [[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1955), and ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' (1977) were admitted by its author to be heavily influenced by the myths of the Northern Europeans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} As that work became popular, elements of its fantasy world moved steadily into popular perceptions of the fantasy genre. In nearly any modern fantasy novel today can be found such Germanic creatures as elves, dwarfs and trolls.
*Children's writer [[Alan Garner]] borrowed many Norse concepts, such as the tale of [[Freyja]]'s necklace ''[[Brísingamen]]'' and the hard winter (''[[Fimbulwinter]]'') which portends the end of the world, [[Ragnarok]] in his classic story, ''[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen]]'' (1960).
* [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s novel, ''[[Eight Days of Luke]]'' (1975) is an allegory of the Norse gods. [[Loki]], [[Thor]], [[Odin]], [[Frey]] and [[Freya]] are characters in the story.

*''[[The Book of the Dun Cow (novel)|The Book of the Dun Cow]]'' (1978) by [[Walter Wangerin, Jr.]] combines Norse legends with biblical themes.
* [[Douglas Adams]] referenced to the Norse god, Thor in his book ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'' (1982). Odin and Thor also appear in ''[[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul]]'', one of two novels by Adams about protagonist Dirk Gently. In the subsequent, sixth, ''[[Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' novel (''[[And Another Thing... (novel)|And Another Thing]]''), by [[Eoin Colfer]], Thor appears in a prominent role.
*[[David Drake]]'s ''[[Northworld]]'' (1990) trilogy retells stories from Norse mythology in a science fiction setting.
*[[Nick Perumov]] involves Norse gods, creatures and events in his fantasy novel ''[[Godsdoom]]'' (1995), as well as in its sequels and prequels.
*Various characters from Norse mythology inspire the naming and characterization of those in [[J.K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, for example the werewolf [[Fenrir Greyback]] and the [[Death Eater]] [[Thorfinn Rowle]].
* Norse mythology plays heavily into the ''[[Everworld]]'' series of fantasy by [[K.A. Applegate]], Loki and Hel being perhaps the two most notable Norse characters.
*Michael Jan Friedman's ''Vidar'' trilogy (''The Hammer and the Horn'', 1985, ''The Seekers and the Sword'', 1985, and ''The Fortress and the Fire'', 1988) presents Norse gods both in Asgard and the contemporary world.
*The novels ''[[Bloodtide (novel)|Bloodtide]]'' (1999) and ''[[Bloodsong]]'' (200) by children's author [[Melvin Burgess]] are loosely based on the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'' legend. He also wrote a short story about pagan sacrifice in the 2008 short story collection ''[[Centuries of Stories]]''.
* Odin, Loki, and several other Norse mythological figures are major characters in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s novel ''[[American Gods]]'' (2001). Gaiman returned to such [[Norsement|Nordic]] inspirations when he wrote ''[[Odd and the Frost Giants]]'' as a [[World Book Day]] publication in 2008. This story is loosely based on the Master-Builder narrative found in the ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' ([[Old Norse]]: ''The Tricking of [[Gylfi]]'') section of [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s ''[[Prose Edda]]''.
*''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' (2004) by [[Nancy Farmer (author)|Nancy Farmer]] is heavily influenced by Norse mythology. Also, its sequel ''[[The Land of the Silver Apples]]'' (2007) is based on Norse mythology.
*''[[The Thrall's Tale]]'' (2006) by [[Judith Lindbergh]] is heavily influenced by Norse mythology and is partially told by Thorbjorg the Seeress, an Old Norse priestess of the ''Vinland'' Sagas.
* ''[[Runemarks]]'' by Joanne Harris (2007) is based on the Norse legends, and creates a post Ragnarok world in which the gods have been scattered and their powers diminished.
*[[Greg van Eekhout]]'s debut novel ''[[Norse Code]]'', released May 2009, retells the story of Ragnarok set in a quickly-deteriorating Los Angeles.
*The ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' series novel ''[[Halo: Contact Harvest|Contact Harvest]]'' takes place on the planet Harvest, which contains many references to Norse mythology. These references include locations named after the [[BiFrost]], [[Útgarðar|Utgard]] with two of the central [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] characters being named after [[Loki]] and [[Sif]]. Many other characters and locations contain references to Norse mythology due to the majority of the colony having Scandinavian ancestry.
*The ''Tales from the Wyrd Museum'' trilogy by [[Robin Jarvis]] heavily utilizes Norse mythology as the basis for the stories, with the third, ''[[The Fatal Strand]]'', referencing this source, [[Odin]] and [[Yggdrasil]] (or in-world versions of) featuring significantly in the plot.
*''[[Witches of East End]]'' by Melissa de la Cruz is about immortal witches that are actually Norse gods, including the goddess [[Freyja]], [[Loki]] and [[Baldr|Balder]]
* ''[[The Ragnarök Conspiracy]]'' by [[Erec Stebbins]] (2012) is a contemporary thriller centered on a plot by terrorists to instigate a global war between Western and Islamic nations. It contains references to [[Old Norse]], Norse [[runes]] such as the [[Elder Futhark]], and [[Norse mythology]] including the events of [[Ragnarök]].
*[[Rick Riordan]] has started ''[[Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard]]'' (2015), a trilogy based on Norse mythology set in the same universe as his ''[[Camp Half-Blood Chronicles]]''.

'''Norwich University of the Arts''' ('''NUA''') is a [[public university]] in [[Norwich, Norfolk]], United Kingdom. It is a former [[higher education institution]] and specialises in art, design and media. Norwich University of the Arts was founded as '''Norwich School of Design''' in 1845 and has a long history of arts education. It gained full university status in 2013. 

NUA is the smaller of two universities in Norwich, the other being the [[University of East Anglia]].

==History==

The history of the university dates back to 1845 when the Norwich School of Design was established to provide designers for local industries. Its founders were the artists and followers of the '[[Norwich School (art movement)|Norwich School of Painters]]', the only provincial British group to establish an international reputation for landscape painting.

Degree-level provision has been offered since 1965, when it was approved to offer the Diploma in Art and Design, validated by the [[National Council for Diplomas in Art and Design]] (NCDAD). After 1965 the School of Art made its own mark on the national art and design scene when twin strengths in Painting and Graphic Design emerged under a group of exceptional practitioners and teachers. From 1975, after NCDAD's merger with the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA), the School offered its first BA Honours degree courses in [[Fine Art]] and [[Graphic Design]], validated by CNAA.

In 1989 the School merged with [[Great Yarmouth]] College of Art to form the '''Norfolk Institute of Art and Design''' (NIAD). In 1991 Norfolk Institute of Art and Design become an Associate College of the new [[Anglia Polytechnic]] with the polytechnic assuming validation responsibilities from CNAA from September 1992. This agreement extended to postgraduate provision, with the first MA course being introduced in 1993 (MA Fine Art) and the first research degree student being registered in 1995.

In 1994 NIAD was incorporated as a Higher Education Institution (HEI), renamed as '''Norwich School of Art and Design''' and re-launched with a new corporate identity.

In November 2007 the School was granted the power to award its own degrees up to Masters level and was renamed '''Norwich University College of the Arts'''.

In January 2013 the institution was given permission by the [[Privy Council]] to become a university and became Norwich University of the Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nua.ac.uk/about/|title=About Norwich University of the Arts - A TEF Gold University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=August 2018}}

==Buildings==

The university campus comprises seven buildings located in [[Norwich]] city centre.
Francis House which is located on Redwell Street is the main reception for NUA, while the majority of academic facilities are a two-minute walk away, along the pedestrianised St Georges Street, with additional sites on the neighbouring Duke Street and St Andrews Street.

Teaching facilities include a large Apple Mac and Windows suite, A1 style printing rooms, wood and metal workshops with a functioning forge, stop-motion animation studios, professional sound booths, open-plan design and illustration studios, constructed textiles and fashion workshops, lecture theatre and comprehensive library.

There are three areas of accommodation for year one students: the newly developed All Saints Green halls of residence comprising a total of 228 rooms, the Beechcroft complex off Sprowston Road and Harvard Court.

==Organisation and structure==
The Vice-Chancellor is Professor John Last and the first Chancellor, appointed on the promotion of the institution to university status in January 2013, Sir [[John Hurt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-21281532|title=Actor Hurt takes chancellor post|date=13 August 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Otaku no Video'''''|おたくのビデオ|Otaku no Bideo|lit. ''"Geeks' Video"''}} is a 1991 [[anime]] spoofing the life and culture of [[otaku]], individuals with obsessive interests in media, particularly anime and [[manga]], as well as the history of [[Gainax]], its creators.  It is noted for its mix of conventional documentary film styles (with actual film, no less), with a more traditional anime storytelling fashion. It is licensed in the United States by [[AnimEigo]]. The ''[[DAICON III and IV Opening Animations]]'' from the early eighties are also featured in this OVA.

==Plot summary==
The story begins in ''Otaku no Video 1982'', where the main character is an [[everyman]] character,&lt;ref&gt;"''Otaku no Video''{{-'}}s story starts out, more or less, like most every anime about anime fans since then. Normal guy meets otaku and gets sucked into the world of cosplay, doujinshi and video games, and life as he knew it changes forever."  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/buried-treasure/2007-11-15&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Kubo, living with his girlfriend Yoshiko and as a member of his college's [[tennis]] team, until introduced by his former friend Tanaka to a club of enthusiasts: a female illustrator, an information [[geek]], a martial artist, and a weapons collector. Kubo soon joins them; and when Yoshiko abandons him, makes the wish to become the supreme enthusiast, under the name of "Otaking".

Kubo's quest continues in ''More Otaku no Video 1985'', set three years later, in which he creates his model kits, opens shops, and builds a factory in China. Later, he loses his fortune when one of his rivals (now married to Yoshiko) takes control of his enterprise; but Kubo and Tanaka, with hard-working artist Misuzu, gradually take over the anime industry with a 'magical girl' show, "Misty May". At the peak of their ambitions, Ken and Tanaka create Otakuland in 1999: the equivalent of [[Disneyland]] for otaku (the story suggests Otakuland to be located in the same city of [[Urayasu]], [[Chiba Prefecture]], as the original [[Tokyo Disneyland]].)&lt;ref&gt;"Urayasu City is where Tokyo Disneyland is located." http://www.animeigo.com/liner/anime/otaku-no-video&lt;/ref&gt;

Many years later, Ken and Tanaka return to Otakuland in a post-apocalyptic submerged Japan and find its central structure, a giant robot, converted into a functional spaceship piloted by their old friends. Miraculously rejuvenated, they fly into space in search of "The Planet of Otaku".

==''A Portrait of an Otaku''==
A controversial and humorous part of ''Otaku no Video'' was the inclusion of live-action documentary excerpts, titled "A Portrait of an Otaku". In these segments, the documentary crew would interview an anonymous otaku, typically ashamed at being a fan and whose face are censored with a [[Pixelization|mosaic]] and have their voices digitally masked. The mock documentary segments serve as a counterpoint to the anime: while the anime emphasizes the camaradrie, creativity, and dreams of mainstream acceptance of otaku, the mock interviews exaggerate its negative qualities. The subjects run the gamut of the otaku subculture: the interviews cover a [[cosplay]]er who now works as a computer programmer and outright denies his cosplay days, even when presented with photographic evidence, but keeps his [[Char Aznable]] helmet in his desk drawer, an [[airsoft]] otaku, a [[garage kit]] otaku, and a shut-in who videorecords television programs for trade, but has not actually watched anything he's recorded. The interviews also contain fans who engage in a range of illicit or unsavory activities, such as [[cel]] thieves, a [[pornography]] fan attempting to manufacture glasses to defeat the mosaic censorship common in Japanese porn videos and who is shown [[masturbate|masturbating]] during the interview, and a computer gamer—famous Gainax member [[Hideaki Anno]]—obsessed with a character in a [[hentai]] computer game (Noriko from ''[[Gunbuster]]''—one of Anno's works—who makes a cameo in Gainax's own hentai game, ''Cybernetic High School'').

It is believed that all the subjects in the Portrait of an Otaku segments were Gainax employees or connected to Gainax at the time of filming.&lt;ref&gt;"...the acting is particularly hammy, and each person is actually a friend or employee of Gainax..." http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/buried-treasure/2007-11-15&lt;/ref&gt;  The first otaku interviewed bore a remarkable resemblance to [[Toshio Okada]], a principal founder in Gainax, in both background and physical appearance. The [[gaikokujin|gaijin]] otaku, Shon Hernandez, has been confirmed to have been Craig York, who with Shon Howell and [[Lea Hernandez]], whose names were borrowed for the character,&lt;ref&gt;"Shon Hernandez" is a combination of Shon Howell and Lea Hernandez, who, together with Craig York (the real person in this segment), were the core of General Products USA." http://www.animeigo.com/liner/anime/otaku-no-video&lt;/ref&gt; were the main staff of General Products USA, an early western branch of Gainax's merchandising enterprise in the early 1990s. The interview with "Shon Hernandez" has been a point of contention with Lea Hernandez, who, in an interview with ''[[Pulp (Viz Media magazine)|PULP]]'' magazine, noted that the interview was unscripted and that Craig York had been fairly sincere in his thoughts and had felt that Gainax insulted their American members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Carl Gustav |last=Horn |date=August 2001 |title=The Curse of Urusei Yatsura: Interview: Lea Hernandez |url=http://www.pulp-mag.com/archives/5.08/interview_hernandez_01.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913202702/http://www.pulp-mag.com/archives/5.08/interview_hernandez_01.shtml |archivedate=September 13, 2006 |work=[[Pulp (Viz Media magazine)|PULP]] |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=28–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interview, the words spoken by Shon Hernandez in the background are noticeably different from what is shown on screen via subtitle (which is based on the Japanese voice-over "translation").

At [[FanimeCon]] 2003, Hiroshi Sato, an animator and another Gainax member, mentioned that he had been in one of the interviews in ''Otaku no Video''. In ''Otaku no Video'', the garage kit otaku was given the [[pseudonym]] "Sato Hiroshi" for the interview.

==Production and release==
Since ''Otaku no Video'' was partially based in the personal life of the original creators of Gainax, who started their careers as otaku during the late seventies and the beginning of the eighties, many anime titles from that period are shown as footage or referenced in the OVA (in costumes, cosplay or other related material). Among them are ''[[Gatchaman]]'', ''[[Uchuu Senkan Yamato]]'', ''[[Urusei Yatsura]]'', ''[[Captain Harlock]]'', ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'', ''[[Dirty Pair]]'', ''[[Space Adventure Cobra]]'', ''[[Phoenix 2772]]'', ''[[Silent Möbius]]'', ''[[Magical Princess Minky Momo]]'', ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'', ''[[Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'', ''[[Genesis Climber Mospeada]]'', ''[[The Wings of Honneamise]]'', ''[[Top o Nerae!]]'' and the ''[[Daicon III and IV Opening Animations]]''.

''Otaku no Video'' was released with subtitles on VHS in North America on March 17, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Video Release Schedule: Coming Soon in America |journal=[[Animerica]] |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=March 1993 |page=18 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |issn=1067-0831}}&lt;/ref&gt; on DVD on April 2, 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Otaku no Video |url=http://dvdlist.kazart.com/queryDVDList2.php3?id=15116 |publisher=Michael's Movie Mayhem |department=BIG List of DVD Releases |access-date=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on Blu-ray Disc on June 24, 2016, all by [[AnimEigo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Robert J. |last=Woodhead |authorlink=Robert Woodhead |date=June 24, 2016 |title=Update #40: Ship Happened... |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/madoverlord/otaku-no-video-otaking-edition-subtitled-anime-blu/posts/1611566 |publisher=[[Kickstarter]] |department=Otaku no Video Otaking Edition Subtitled Anime Blu-Ray |access-date=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 the Porirua Museum opened and by 1997 had outgrown its [[Takapuwahia]] site. At the same time, the Mana Community Arts Council wished to expand their community art gallery, Page 90 Artspace Gallery located on the corner of Parumoana and Norrie Streets. The two organisations amalgamated, moving into the newly renovated and expanded Page 90 site in 1998.&lt;ref name= 'Pataka'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dekker|first1=Diana|title=Pataka director chased non-western art.|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/culture/visual-arts/8173871/Pataka-director-chased-non-western-art|accessdate=9 December 2014|agency=The Dominion Post|publisher=Faifax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Panoramata.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Pleven Panorama from the outside]]
'''Pleven Epopee 1877''', more commonly known as '''Pleven Panorama''', is a [[panorama]] located in [[Pleven]], [[Bulgaria]], that depicts the events of the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-78|Russian-Turkish War of 1877–78]], specifically the five-month [[Siege of Plevna]] (Pleven Epopee) which made the city internationally famous and which contributed to the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] after five&amp;nbsp;centuries of [[History of Ottoman Bulgaria|Ottoman rule]].

The panorama was created by 13&amp;nbsp;[[Russia]]n and Bulgarian artists and was constructed in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Pleven Epopee and was officially unveiled on 10 December 1977. The panorama expanded the already existing [[Skobelev Park]], which is located on the site where three of the four major battles which led to the liberation of Bulgaria took place. In the first three years after its opening, 2.5&amp;nbsp;million people visited the panorama.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The monument is one of nearly 200 built by the people of Pleven in tribute to the battle and to the nearly 35,000&amp;nbsp;lives lost.

==Siege of Plevna==
{{main|Siege of Plevna}}
[[File:Pleven-Panorama-1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A detail of the siege in the interior of the panorama]]
The Pleven Panorama depicts the events of the Siege of Plevna which consisted of four major battles over a five-month period (20 July&amp;ndash;10 December 1877). The siege was pivotal in the outcome in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 which eventually resulted in the liberation of Bulgaria as well as [[Serbia]] and [[Romania]] from 500&amp;nbsp;years of Ottoman control.&lt;ref name="visitbulgaria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visittobulgaria.com/visit/dir.asp?d=0-4-Monuments-Pleven_Panorama|title="Pleven Epopee - 1877" Panorama|accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Panorama primarily focuses on the events of the third battle, which began on 31 August and culminated on 11 September 1877. At the time, Plevna was under Turkish control as [[Field Marshal]] [[Osman Nuri Pasha|Osman Pasha]] had set up fortifications there following his defeat at [[Battle of Nikopol|Nikopol]] on 16 July. Osman was successful at fending off the Russian attacks on his fortifications during the first two&amp;nbsp;battles.&lt;ref name="1911EB"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title = Plevna| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]| volume = 21| pages = 838–840| year = 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third battle, Russian forces, under the command of [[General]] [[Mikhail Skobelev]], took two Turkish [[redoubt]]s and a Romanian division took a third, the [[Grivitsa]] redoubt. Osman's troops were able to recapture the two&amp;nbsp;redoubts taken by the Russians, but they were unable to dislodge the Romanians from Grivitsa. The third battle was the bloodiest for the Russian forces, with roughly 20,000&amp;nbsp;losses, but was also the turning point in the Siege. By 24 October, Russian and Romanian forces had surrounded Plevna. Osman requested permission to retreat, but the Ottoman high command would not allow him to do so. On 9 December Osman and his troops made a brief stand, losing 5,000&amp;nbsp;men. The next day, Osman surrendered the city to Romanian [[colonel]] [[Mihail Cerchez]].&lt;ref name="1911EB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rems"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kremnitz, Mite|title=Reminiscences of the King of Roumania|publisher= Harper &amp; Bros.|year=1899|pages= 293–294

==Construction and unveiling==
[[File:Панорама „Плевенска епопея 1877 г.“.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Pleven Panorama under construction, July 1977]]
Most of the historical landmarks in Pleven are related to the Russo-Turkish war, with around 200&amp;nbsp;monuments commemorating the bloodiest battles of the war. The Pleven Panorama was constructed in honor of the [[centennial]] of the surrender of Turkish forces to Russian and Romanian troops, ending the siege on Plevna. It was conceived and designed by N. Ovetchkin, an author from [[Moscow]] as a counterpart to the Borodin Panorama in [[Belgorod|Belgorod, Russia]].&lt;ref name="visitbulgaria"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.picturesofbulgaria.com/article/pleven.html|title=Settlements: Pleven|publisher=Pictures of Bulgaria|accessdate=2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panorama is situated in Skobelev Park, named for the general who commanded the Russian forces and led them to victory over the Turks at Plevna, and the site upon which the deciding battle of the five-month siege on the city occurred.&lt;ref name="properties"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bulgarianproperties.com/Bulgaria/Pleven.html|title=The town of Pleven - Tourist information|accessdate=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Eleven&amp;nbsp;Russian and two Bulgarian artists painted and constructed the [[panoramic painting]] which includes a 115&amp;times;15-meter main canvas and 12-meter foreground.  The goal of Ovetchkin and the artists who created the panorama was to create a feeling of empathy for the battle that was fought on the site as well as a feeling of authenticity of the events that occurred on 11 September 1877. The panorama opened to the public on 10 December 1977, 100&amp;nbsp;years to the day that Field Marshal Osman Pasha surrendered to Colonel Mihail Cerchez, ending the Pleven Epopee.&lt;ref name="visitbulgaria"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bnr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnr.bg/RadioBulgaria/Emission_English/Theme_History_And_Religion/Material/Pleven.htm|title=Pleven Panorama Monumental|date=2005-04-14|accessdate=2007-09-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235855/http://www.bnr.bg/RadioBulgaria/Emission_English/Theme_History_And_Religion/Material/Pleven.htm|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The architectural unit is composed of four rooms: introductory, panoramic, diorame and finale. The six canvases of the introductory room discover the tragic destiny of the people, their dramatic fight and their compassion to the fellow Russian soldiers.
The spectator is in the middle of the battlefield, surrounded by an attacking Russian regiment, smoking shells, a doctor and a nurse, the attack of the Turkish cavalry, burning fires in the city, and the Russian General [[Mikhail Skobelev]] conducting an attack against the Ottoman fortification.

'''Print Wikipedia''' is an art project by [[Michael Mandiberg]] that printed 106 of the 7,473 volumes of [[English Wikipedia]] as it existed on April 7, 2015.

[[File:Wikipedia Contributor Appendix (Detail).jpg|thumb|left|Wikipedia page from Contributor Appendix (detail)]]

Mandiberg originally thought of the project in 2009 but ran into technical difficulties.  He then engaged an assistant, Jonathan Kirinathan, to aid with the programming of the code to compile, format and upload an entire English Wikipedia download.&lt;ref name="The Hindu"&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/print-wikipedia-in-7600-volumes-to-sell-for-500000/article7339125.ece "Print Wikipedia, in 7,600 volumes, to sell for $500,000", [[The Hindu]], 22 June 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;  The print files were uploaded to self book publisher [[Lulu.com]] and are available for printout as paper volumes.

Mandiberg's motivation was to answer the question, "How big is it?" For a [[big data]] entity, its size is on the threshold of what can be perceived as a collection of volumes, but not so large as to overwhelm one's senses, such as the data files of [[Facebook]] or the [[NSA]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02v2vrn? "Why Print Copies of Wikipedia?" Interview with Michael Mandiberg by [[Dan Damon]], [[BBC]] World Update, 19 June 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Katherine Maher]], the Executive Director of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], has described it as "a gesture at knowledge". Wikimedia has cooperated with the project and Lulu.com has helped fund it.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

The task took three years, and the upload process took 24 days, 3 hours and 18 minutes. It was completed on 12 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schuessler|first1=Jennifer|title=Print Wikipedia Project Reaches Final Entry|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/print-wikipedia-project-reaches-final-entry/|accessdate=13 July 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[PediaPress]] had attempted to raise money for a full English Wikipedia print out on [[Indiegogo]] in 2014, with a goal of $50,000 (£30,000), but the project was pulled.&lt;ref name="ArtNews"&gt;[http://www.artnews.com/2015/06/24/from-aaaaa-to-zzzap-michael-mandiberg-on-his-plan-to-print-wikipedia/ Hannah Ghorashi, “From AAAAA! ToZZZAP!: Michael Mandiberg on his plan to print Wikipedia”, [[ARTnews]], 24 June 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
The pulled project had intended to print off 1000 volumes, which would include 1200 pages each- 1,200,000 pages in total and about 80 meters of shelf space&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/03/27/295262783/printing-wikipedia-would-take-1-million-pages-but-thats-sort-of-the-point&lt;/ref&gt;. Mandiberg later assured people that he won't be printing out the entire collection, claiming an entire collection is not necessary for people to comprehend the true size of Wikipedia, and once people have seen a portion of it, it will help them realize its size.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/print-wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;  
Mandiberg estimates that the printing costs of a full printout are around $500,000. The Denny art exhibit featured only a selection of actually printed volumes with about 2000 of the other volumes represented as spines on the wall. The show revolved around the actual upload of the print files to Lulu.com.&lt;ref name="MutualArt"/&gt;

{{Communication}}
{{Performing arts}}
'''Public speaking''' (also called '''oratory''' or '''oration''') is the process or act of performing a good [[Speech communication|speech]] to a live [[audience]]. This type of speech is deliberately structured with three general purposes: to inform, to persuade and to entertain. Public speaking is commonly understood as formal, face-to-face speaking of a single person to a group of listeners.&lt;ref&gt;''General Purposes of Speaking''. 2012books.lardbucket.org. Retrieved 2016-11-04.{{ISBN needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public speaking can be governed by different rules and structures. For example, speeches about concepts do not necessarily have to be structured in any special way. However, there is a method behind giving it effectively. For this type of speech it would be good to describe that concept with examples that can relate to the audiences life. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Speaker The Tradition and practice of public speaking|last=Valenzano III|first=Joseph M.|last2=Braden|first2=Stephen W.|publisher=Fountainhead press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-59871-522-4|location=United States of America|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
There are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in [[Lasswell's model of communication]]: the communicator, message, medium, audience and effect. In short, the speaker should be answering the question "''who'' says ''what'' in which ''channel'' to ''whom'' with what ''effect''?"

Public speaking can serve the purpose of transmitting information, telling a story, motivating people to act or some combination of those. Public speaking can also take the form of a [[discourse community]], in which the audience and speaker use discourse to achieve a common goal.

Public speaking for business and commercial events is often done by professionals. These speakers can be contracted independently, through representation by a [[speakers bureau]], or by other means. Public speaking plays a large role in the professional world; in fact, it is believed that 70 percent of all jobs involve some form of public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Lisa.

However, the most significant records are found among the ancient Greeks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first known piece&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, James J.  [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Demosthenes-Greek-statesman-and-orator "Demosthenes – greatest Greek orator".] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; on oratory, written over 2,000 years ago, came from ancient Greece. This work elaborated on principles drawn from the practices and experiences of ancient Greek orators. [[Aristotle]] was one of the first recorded teachers of oratory to use definitive rules and models. His emphasis on oratory led to oration becoming an essential part of a [[liberal arts]] education during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. The [[classical antiquity]] works written by the ancient Greeks capture the ways they taught and developed the art of public speaking thousands of years ago.

In classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[rhetoric]] was the main component of [[Composition studies|composition]] and speech delivery, both of which were critical skills for citizens to use in public and private life. In ancient Greece, citizens spoke on their own behalf rather than having professionals, like modern lawyers, speak for them. Any [[citizen]] who wished to succeed in court, in politics or in social life had to learn techniques of public speaking. Rhetorical tools were first taught by a group of rhetoric teachers called [[Sophists]] who are notable for teaching paying students how to speak effectively using the methods they developed.

Separately from the Sophists, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] all developed their own theories of public speaking and taught these principles to students who wanted to learn skills in rhetoric. Plato and Aristotle taught these principles in schools that they founded, [[Platonic Academy|The Academy]] and [[Aristotles Lyceum|The Lyceum]], respectively. Although Greece eventually lost political sovereignty, the Greek culture of training in public speaking was adopted almost identically by the Romans.

In the political rise of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman orators copied and modified the ancient Greek techniques of public speaking. Instruction in rhetoric developed into a full curriculum, including instruction in grammar (study of the poets), preliminary exercises ([[progymnasmata]]), and preparation of public speeches (declamation) in both [[Forensic linguistics|forensic]] and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] genres.

The Latin style of rhetoric was heavily influenced by [[Cicero]] and involved a strong emphasis on a broad education in all areas of [[Humanities|humanistic study]] in the liberal arts, including philosophy. Other areas of study included the use of wit and humor, the [[Pathos|appeal to the listener's emotions]], and the use of [[digression]]s. Oratory in the [[Roman empire]], though less central to political life than in the days of the Republic, remained significant in law and became a big form of entertainment. Famous orators became like celebrities in ancient Rome—very wealthy and prominent members of society.

The Latin style was the primary form of oration until the beginning of the 20th century. After [[World War II]], however, the Latin style of oration began to gradually grow out of style as the trend of ornate speaking became seen as impractical. This cultural change likely had to do with the rise of the [[scientific method]] and the emphasis on a "plain" style of speaking and writing. Even formal oratory is much less ornate today than it was in the Classical Era.

Despite the shift in style, the best-known examples of strong public speaking are still studied ''years'' after their delivery. Among these examples are [[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] in 427 BCE addressing those that died during the [[Peloponnesian War]]; Abraham Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] in 1863; Sojourner Truth's identification of racial issues in "[[Ain't I a Woman?]]”; and Mahatma Gandhi's message of nonviolent resistance in India, which in turn inspired Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech at the Washington Monument in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;German, Kathleen M. (2010). ''Principles of Public Speaking''. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-205-65396-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==
In addition to simple oratory skills, tools and technologies have been created which allow for more methods of communication for speakers and public orators. [[Lectern]]s hold papers while speakers talk. A speaker can project his or her voice with the aid of a [[public address system]] or a [[microphone]] and [[loudspeaker]] when speaking in front of a large audience. Public speakers may also use [[audience response systems]], allowing listeners to interact with the speech as it happens.

Telecommunication and [[videoconferencing]] are also a form of public speaking. David M. Fetterman of [[Stanford University]] wrote in his 1997 article ''Videoconferencing over the Internet'': "Videoconferencing technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone [[communication]] systems." This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face-to-face communication between parties without demanding the inconvenience of travel.

[[File:Hal Blaine in 2008.jpg|thumb|Session musician [[Hal Blaine]] (pictured 2008) is widely regarded as one of the most prolific drummers in rock and roll history, having "certainly played on more hit records than any drummer in the rock era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://rockhall.com/inductees/hal-blaine/bio/ | title= Hal Blaine Biography | publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] | accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Session musicians''', '''studio musicians''', or '''backing musicians''' are musicians hired to perform in [[recording session]]s or live performances. Session musicians are usually not permanent members of a [[musical ensemble]] or band. They work behind the scenes and rarely achieve individual fame in their own right as [[solo (music)|soloists]] or [[bandleader]]s. However, top session musicians are well known within the [[music industry]], and some have become publicly recognized, such as [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]] and [[Motown]]'s [[The Funk Brothers]].

Many session musicians specialize in playing common instruments such as [[guitar]], [[piano]], [[electric bass|bass]], or [[drum kit|drums]]. Others are specialists, and play [[brass instrument|brass]], [[woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], and [[string instrument|strings]]. Many session musicians play multiple instruments, which lets them play in a wider range of musical situations, genres and styles. Examples of "doubling" include [[double bass]] and [[electric bass]]; [[acoustic guitar]] and [[mandolin]]; [[piano]] and [[accordion]]; and saxophone and other woodwind instruments.

Session musicians are used when musical skills are needed on a short-term basis. Typically session musicians are used by recording studios to provide [[backing tracks]] for other musicians for recording sessions and live performances; recording music for [[advertising]], film, television, and [[theatre]]. In the 2000s, the terms "session musician" and "studio musician" are synonymous, though in past decades, "studio musician" meant a musician associated with a single [[record company]], [[recording studio]] or [[entertainment agency]].

[[File:SenorTembloresCuzcoMerced2010.jpg|thumb|250px|Señor de los Temblores]]
The '''Señor de los Temblores''' (Lord of the Earthquakes), known in [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]] as '''Taytacha Temblores''', is a statue of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] from [[Cusco Cathedral]] in [[Cusco]], [[Peru]]. The image is popularly believed to have placated any further disaster caused by the 1650 earthquake.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Defining Latin American Art|author=Chaplik, D.|date=2005|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=9780786417285|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LsNPAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the [[patron saint]] of Cusco,&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Taytacha Temblores: patrón jurado del Cuzco|author=E, V.E.V.|date=1991|publisher=Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología CONCYTEC|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPcQAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the most well-known images in Peru. It was probably created in Peru by native artists around 1570, and is made of mixed materials, including sticks, plaques of agave fiber, and plaster. The black color is not the original tone but was created by the buildup of soot from candles and oil lamps, and pigment and pollen from the red ''ñuk'chu'' flowers that are showered on the statue when it is taken in procession on Holy Monday.&lt;ref&gt;Maya Stanfield-Mazzi, ''Object and Apparition: Envisioning the Christian Divine in the Colonial Andes'' (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steven Bell''' (born 26 February 1951) is an English political [[cartoonist]], whose work appears in ''[[The Guardian]]'' and other publications. He is known for his [[left-wing]] views.

==Early life==
Born in [[Walthamstow]], [[London]], and raised in [[Slough]], Bell moved to [[North Yorkshire]] with his family in 1968, where he trained as an artist at the [[Teesside College of Art]]. He graduated in film-making and art from the [[University of Leeds]] in 1974 and trained as an art teacher at St Luke's College, Exeter (now [[St Luke's Campus]] at the [[University of Exeter]]) in 1975. He taught art for one year in [[Birmingham]] before becoming a freelance cartoonist in 1977. His [[comic strip]] ''Maggie's Farm'' appeared in the London [[listings magazine]] ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' from 1979 and later in ''[[City Limits (London magazine)|City Limits]]'', and ''Lord God Almighty'' appeared in ''[[Leveller magazine|The Leveller]]'' in the 1970s. In 1980 he contributed a cartoon interpretation of the lyrics to ''Ivan Meets G.I. Joe'' to the inner lyric bag of [[the Clash]]'s triple album ''[[Sandinista!]]''

==Cartoonist==
Steve Bell is probably best known for the daily strip called ''[[If... (comic)|If...]]'', which has appeared in ''The Guardian'' newspaper since 1981, and since the mid-1990s he has also been that newspaper's principal editorial cartoonist.

Collections of his [[cartoon]]s have been published, and he has also illustrated original books in collaboration with authors. He has made short animated films with [[Bob Godfrey]], including a short series of animated cartoons for [[Channel 4]] television in 1999 to mark the 20th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher's rise to power, entitled ''Margaret Thatcher – Where Am I Now?'' He has appeared in a radio programme about the life of 18th century caricaturist [[James Gillray]]. Earlier in his career he wrote and drew the [[Gremlins (comic strip)|''Gremlins'']] comic strip for the [[British comics|British comic]] ''[[Jackpot (comic)|Jackpot]]''.

Bell's parodies include [[Goya]]'s ''[[The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters]]'' (in an editorial cartoon about the [[UK Independence Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cartoons/stevebell/0,7371,1234690,00.html|title=09.06.04: Robert Kilroy-Silk and the UKIP - Cartoons - guardian.co.uk|website=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;); [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[The Gate of Calais]]'' about the ban on UK meat exports following outbreaks of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] and bovine [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]]; and – before the 2005 General Election when it briefly seemed as if the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] might seriously threaten [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] – [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s ''[[The Fighting Temeraire]]'', in which a chirpy [[Charles Kennedy]] as [[tug-boat]] towed a grotesque and dilapidated [[Tony Blair]] to be broken up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cartoons/stevebell/0,7371,1470547,00.html|title=26.04.05: Tony Blair and Iraq - Cartoons - guardian.co.uk|website=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]], for his cartoon the next day, 9 April 2013, Bell adapted [[:File:DVinfernoUbertiAddressesDante m.jpg|an illustration]] by [[Gustave Doré]] of [[Farinata degli Uberti|Farinata]] in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', giving Thatcher the speech bubble "Why is this pit still open??" with reference to the closure of coal mines after the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|miners' strike of 1984–85]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cartoon/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-death-steve-bell-cartoon|title=Steve Bell on Margaret Thatcher's death – cartoon|first=Steve|last=Bell|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell's cartoons regularly feature grotesque caricatures, and have sometimes caused controversy as well as receiving critical acclaim. During the [[Operation Pillar of Defense|November 2012 Israel/Gaza conflict]] ''The Guardian'' published a cartoon by Bell showing the Israeli Prime Minister, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], as a puppeteer controlling [[William Hague]] and [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cartoon/2012/nov/15/israel-gaza "Steve Bell on Tony Blair and William Hague's role in Israel-Gaza clash – cartoon"], ''The Guardian'' (website), 15 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Rich]], blogging for the [[Community Security Trust]], said that the illustration was comparable to those featured in Nazi and other antisemitic publications.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Rich [http://blog.thecst.org.uk/?p=3931 "Jews, puppets and the Guardian"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129203536/http://blog.thecst.org.uk/?p=3931 |date=29 November 2012 }}, Community Security Trust *(blog), 16 November 2012,&lt;/ref&gt; While Bell defended his cartoon,&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Lipman [http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/91862/steve-bell-defends-guardian-cartoon "Steve Bell defends Guardian cartoon"], ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 22 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the newspaper's readers' editor Chris Elliott concluded in an article on 25 November: "While journalists and cartoonists should be free to express an opinion that Netanyahu is opportunistic and manipulative, in my view they should not use the language – including the visual language – of antisemitic stereotypes."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Elliott [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/25/accusations-of-antisemitism-political-cartoon "Open door: The readers' editor on… accusations of antisemitism against a political cartoon"], ''The Guardian'', 25 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's [[Press Complaints Commission]] PCC received 22 complaints, but ruled on 19 December that it was unable to take the matter further.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Lipman [http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/94664/pcc-rules-no-breach-over-steve-bell-gaza-cartoon "PCC rules no breach over Steve Bell Gaza cartoon",] ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 19 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015]], there was outrage on [[Twitter]] over an ''If...'' cartoon strip depicting [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) leader [[Nicola Sturgeon]] as refusing to compromise on their "core demand" for  "incest and Scottish folk dancing".

[[File:Ceramic Tile Tessellations in Marrakech.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Zellige]] [[terracotta]] tiles in [[Marrakech]], forming edge-to-edge, regular and other tessellations]]
[[File:Leeuwarden - Tegeltableau Escher.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A wall sculpture in [[Leeuwarden]] celebrating the artistic tessellations of [[M. C. Escher]] ]]

A '''tessellation''' of a flat surface is the tiling of a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] using one or more [[geometric shape]]s, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In [[mathematics]], tessellations can be generalized to [[high-dimensional spaces|higher dimensions]] and a variety of geometries.

A periodic tiling has a repeating pattern. Some special kinds include [[Euclidean tilings by convex regular polygons|regular tilings]] with [[regular polygon]]al tiles all of the same shape, and [[semiregular tiling]]s with regular tiles of more than one shape and with every corner identically arranged. The patterns formed by periodic tilings can be categorized into 17 [[wallpaper groups]]. A tiling that lacks a repeating pattern is called "non-periodic". An [[aperiodic tiling]] uses a small set of tile shapes that cannot form a repeating pattern. In the geometry of higher dimensions, a space-filling or [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycomb]] is also called a ''tessellation of space''.

A real physical tessellation is a tiling made of materials such as [[cement]]ed [[ceramic]] squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be decorative [[patterns]], or may have functions such as providing durable and water-resistant [[pavement (architecture)|pavement]], floor or wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in [[Ancient Rome]] and in [[Islamic art]] such as in the [[Islamic geometric patterns|decorative geometric tiling]] of the [[Alhambra]] palace. In the twentieth century, the work of [[M. C. Escher]] often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary [[Euclidean geometry]] and in [[hyperbolic geometry]], for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in [[quilting]]. Tessellations form a class of [[patterns in nature]], for example in the arrays of [[Hexagonal tiling|hexagonal cells]] found in [[honeycomb]]s.

==History==
[[File:Stone-Cone Temple mosaics, Pergamon Museum.JPG|thumb|left|A temple mosaic from the ancient Sumerian city of [[Uruk]] IV (3400–3100 BC), showing a tessellation pattern in coloured tiles]]

Tessellations were used by the [[Architecture of Mesopotamia|Sumerians]] (about 4000 BC) in building wall decorations formed by patterns of clay tiles.&lt;ref name="Pickover2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pickover |first=Clifford A. |title=The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the History of Mathematics |year=2009 |publisher=Sterling |isbn=9781402757969 |page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decorative [[mosaic]] tilings made of small squared blocks called [[tessera]]e were widely employed in [[classical antiquity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dunbabin | first1=Katherine M. D. | title=Mosaics of the Greek and Roman world | date=2006 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes displaying geometric patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Brantingham Geometric Mosaics | url=http://www.hullcc.gov.uk/museumcollections/collections/storydetail.php?irn=410 | publisher=Hull City Council | accessdate=26 May 2015 | date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Field1988/&gt;

In 1619 [[Johannes Kepler]] made an early documented study of tessellations. He wrote about regular and semiregular tessellations in his ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]''; he was possibly the first to explore and to explain the hexagonal structures of honeycomb and [[snowflakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Johannes Kepler | author=Kepler, Johannes | date=1619 | titlelink=Harmonices Mundi | title=Harmonices Mundi |trans-title=Harmony of the Worlds }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gullberg|1997|p=395}}{{sfn|Stewart|2001|p=13}}

Some two hundred years later in 1891, the Russian crystallographer [[Yevgraf Fyodorov]] proved that every periodic tiling of the plane features one of seventeen different groups of isometries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://public.lanl.gov/djidjev/papers/coverage_chapter.pdf | title=Dynamic Coverage Problems in Sensor Networks | publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory | year=2012 | accessdate=6 April 2013 |author1=Djidjev, Hristo |author2=Potkonjak, Miodrag |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Fyodorov, Y. | authorlink=Yevgraf Fyodorov | date=1891 | title=Simmetrija na ploskosti [Symmetry in the plane] | journal=Zapiski Imperatorskogo Sant-Petersburgskogo Mineralogicheskogo Obshchestva [Proceedings of the Imperial St. Petersburg Mineralogical Society], series 2 | volume=28 | pages=245–291| language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fyodorov's work marked the unofficial beginning of the mathematical study of tessellations. Other prominent contributors include Aleksei Shubnikov and Nikolai Belov (1964),&lt;ref name="ShubnikovBelov1964"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Shubnikov | first1=Alekseĭ Vasilʹevich | last2=Belov | first2=Nikolaĭ Vasilʹevich | title=Colored Symmetry | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKk9AAAAIAAJ | year=1964 | publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heinrich Heesch]] and Otto Kienzle (1963).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Heesch | first1=H. | last2=Kienzle | first2=O. | title=Flächenschluss: System der Formen lückenlos aneinanderschliessender Flächteile | date=1963 | publisher=Springer | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
In Latin, ''tessella'' is a small cubical piece of [[clay]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]] or [[glass]] used to make mosaics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/tessellate | title=Tessellate | publisher=Merriam-Webster Online | accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "tessella" means "small square" (from ''tessera'', square, which in turn is from the Greek word τέσσερα for ''four''). It corresponds to the everyday term ''tiling'', which refers to applications of tessellations, often made of [[ceramic glaze|glazed]] clay.

==Overview==
[[File:Semi-regular-floor-3464.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A [[rhombitrihexagonal tiling]]: tiled floor in the [[Archeological Museum of Seville]], Spain, using square, triangle and hexagon prototiles]]

Tessellation in two dimensions, also called planar tiling, is a topic in geometry that studies how shapes, known as ''tiles'', can be arranged to fill a plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are that there must be no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Conway, R. |author2=Burgiel, H. |author3=Goodman-Strauss, G. | title=The Symmetries of Things | publisher=Peters | date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tessellations created by [[Bond (brick)|bonded brickwork]] do not obey this rule. Among those that do, a [[regular tessellation]] has both identical{{efn|The mathematical term for identical shapes is "congruent" – in mathematics, "identical" means they are the same tile.}} [[regular polygon|regular tiles]] and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Coxeter, H. S. M. | title=Regular Polytopes | edition=3rd | publisher=Dover | date=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral [[triangle]], [[square]], and regular [[hexagon]]. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to fill a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] with no gaps.{{sfn|Gullberg|1997|p=395}}

Many other types of tessellation are possible under different constraints. For example, there are eight types of semi-regular tessellation, made with more than one kind of regular polygon but still having the same arrangement of polygons at every corner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Cundy and Rollett | title=Mathematical Models | edition=2nd | publisher=Oxford | date=1961 | pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irregular tessellations can also be made from other shapes such as [[pentagons]], [[polyominoes]] and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape. The artist [[M. C. Escher]] is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles, shaped like animals and other natural objects.{{sfn|Escher|1974|pp=11–12, 15–16}} If suitable contrasting colours are chosen for the tiles of differing shape, striking patterns are formed, and these can be used to decorate physical surfaces such as church floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.basilicasanmarco.it/basilica/architettura/il-pavimento-tessulare/?lang=en | title=Basilica di San Marco | publisher=Basilica di San Marco | work=Section: Tessellated floor | accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More formally, a tessellation or tiling is a [[cover (topology)|cover]] of the Euclidean plane by a [[countable]] number of closed sets, called ''tiles'', such that the tiles intersect only on their [[Boundary (topology)|boundaries]]. These tiles may be polygons or any other shapes.{{efn|The tiles are usually required to be [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] (topologically equivalent) to a [[closed disk]], which means bizarre shapes with holes, dangling line segments or infinite areas are excluded.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum/&gt;}} Many tessellations are formed from a finite number of [[prototile]]s in which all tiles in the tessellation are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to the given prototiles. If a geometric shape can be used as a prototile to create a tessellation, the shape is said to ''tessellate'' or to ''tile the plane''. The [[Conway criterion]] is a sufficient but not necessary set of rules for deciding if a given shape tiles the plane periodically without reflections: some tiles fail the criterion but still tile the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title=Will It Tile? Try the Conway Criterion! | author=Schattschneider, Doris |magazine=Mathematics Magazine | volume=53 | issue=4 | date=September 1980 |pages=224–233 | doi=10.2307/2689617}}&lt;/ref&gt; No general rule has been found for determining if a given shape can tile the plane or not, which means there are many unsolved problems concerning tessellations.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum/&gt;

Mathematically, tessellations can be extended to spaces other than the Euclidean plane.{{sfn|Gullberg|1997|p=395}} The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[geometry|geometer]] [[Ludwig Schläfli]] pioneered this by defining ''polyschemes'', which mathematicians nowadays call [[polytopes]]. These are the analogues to polygons and [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] in spaces with more dimensions. He further defined the [[Schläfli symbol]] notation to make it easy to describe polytopes. For example, the Schläfli symbol for an equilateral triangle is {3}, while that for a square is {4}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWvXsVInpgMC&amp;lpg=PP1 | title=Regular Polytopes | publisher=Methuen | author=Coxeter, H. S. M. | year=1948 |pages=14, 69, 149| isbn=9780486614809 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Schläfli notation makes it possible to describe tilings compactly. For example, a tiling of regular hexagons has three six-sided polygons at each vertex, so its Schläfli symbol is {6,3}.&lt;ref name="MathWorldTessellation"&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Tessellation|id=Tessellation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods also exist for describing polygonal tilings. When the tessellation is made of regular polygons, the most common notation is the [[vertex configuration]], which is simply a list of the number of sides of the polygons around a vertex. The square tiling has a vertex configuration of 4.4.4.4, or 4&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. The tiling of regular hexagons is noted 6.6.6, or 6&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum&gt;{{cite book | last=Grünbaum |first=Branko | title=Tilings and Patterns | year=1987 | publisher=W. H. Freeman | location=New York | author2=Shephard, G. C. | author2link=Geoffrey Colin Shephard | page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction to tessellations===
{{Further|Euclidean tilings of regular polygons|Uniform tiling||List of convex uniform tilings}}

Mathematicians use some technical terms when discussing tilings. An ''[[edge (geometry)|edge]]'' is the intersection between two bordering tiles; it is often a straight line. A ''[[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]]'' is the point of intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an ''isogonal'' or [[vertex-transitive]] tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of [[polygon]]s about each vertex is the same.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum/&gt; The [[fundamental domain|fundamental region]] is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the tessellation.&lt;ref name="EmmerSchattschneider2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Emmer |first1=Michele |last2=Schattschneider |first2=Doris |title=M.C. Escher's Legacy: A Centennial Celebration |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5DDyBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA325 |date=8 May 2007 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |isbn=978-3-540-28849-7 |page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of [[square tiling|four squares at every vertex]].&lt;ref name=Grunbaum/&gt;

The sides of the polygons are not necessarily identical to the edges of the tiles. An '''edge-to-edge tiling''' is any polygonal tessellation where adjacent tiles only share one full side, i.e., no tile shares a partial side or more than one side with any other tile. In an edge-to-edge tiling, the sides of the polygons and the edges of the tiles are the same. The familiar "brick wall" tiling is not edge-to-edge because the long side of each rectangular brick is shared with two bordering bricks.&lt;ref name=Grunbaum/&gt;

A ''normal tiling'' is a tessellation for which every tile is [[topologically]] equivalent to a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]], the intersection of any two tiles is a single [[connected set]] or the [[empty set]], and all tiles are [[uniformly bounded]]. This means that a single circumscribing radius and a single inscribing radius can be used for all the tiles in the whole tiling; the condition disallows tiles that are pathologically long or thin.&lt;ref name=Horne2000&gt;{{cite book |last=Horne | first=Clare E. | title=Geometric Symmetry in Patterns and Tilings | year=2000 |publisher=Woodhead Publishing |isbn=9781855734920 |pages=172, 175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:P5-type15-chiral_coloring.png|thumb|left|upright|The 15th convex monohedral [[pentagonal tiling]], discovered in 2015]]

A &lt;span id="Monohedral" style="white-pace:nowrap;font-weight:bold"&gt;monohedral tiling&lt;/span&gt; is a tessellation in which all tiles are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]]; it has only one prototile. A particularly interesting type of monohedral tessellation is the spiral monohedral tiling. The first spiral monohedral tiling was discovered by Heinz Voderberg in 1936; the [[Voderberg tiling]] has a unit tile that is a nonconvex [[enneagon]].&lt;ref name="Pickover2009" /&gt; The '''Hirschhorn tiling''', published by Michael D. Hirschhorn and D. C. Hunt in 1985, is a [[pentagon tiling]] using irregular pentagons: regular pentagons cannot tile the Euclidean plane as the [[internal angle]] of a regular pentagon, {{sfrac|3{{pi}}|5}}, is not a divisor of 2{{pi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/symmetry/radspir1.htm | title=Some Special Radial and Spiral Tilings | publisher=University of Wisconsin | date=29 July 1999 | accessdate=6 April 2013 | author=Dutch, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirschhorn1985&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hirschhorn | first=M.

[[File:2005-06-25 Tiles together.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Pythagorean tiling]] ]]

An isohedral tiling is a special variation of a monohedral tiling in which all tiles belong to the same transitivity class, that is, all tiles are transforms of the same prototile under the [[symmetry]] group of the tiling.&lt;ref name=Horne2000/&gt; If a prototile admits a tiling, but no such tiling is isohedral, then the prototile is called anisohedral and forms [[anisohedral tiling]]s.

A [[Tiling by regular polygons|regular tessellation]] is a highly [[symmetry|symmetric]], edge-to-edge tiling made up of [[regular polygon]]s, all of the same shape. There are only three regular tessellations: those made up of [[equilateral triangle]]s, [[square (geometry)|squares]], or regular [[hexagon]]s. All three of these tilings are isogonal and monohedral.&lt;ref name=threeregular&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Regular Tessellations|id=RegularTessellations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Tiling by regular polygons#Archimedean, uniform or semiregular tilings|semi-regular (or Archimedean) tessellation]] uses more than one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two).{{sfn|Stewart|2001|p=75}} These can be described by their [[vertex configuration]]; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (each vertex has one square and two octagons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nrich.maths.org/1556 | title=Schläfli Tessellations | publisher=University of Cambridge | date=1997–2012 | accessdate=26 April 2013 | author=NRICH (Millennium Maths Project)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of [[Pythagorean tiling]]s, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Wells | first=David | year=1991 | title=The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Geometry | publisher=Penguin Books | location=New York | isbn=0-14-011813-6 | pages=260–261 | contribution=two squares tessellation}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[edge tessellation]] is one in which each tile can be reflected over an edge to take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kirby, Matthew; Umble, Ronald |title=Edge Tessellations and Stamp Folding Puzzles |journal=Mathematics Magazine |volume=84 |issue=4 |date=2011 |pages=283–89 |doi=10.4169/math.mag.84.4.283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wallpaper groups===

===Aperiodic tilings===

[[File:Penrose Tiling (Rhombi).svg|thumb|upright|A [[Penrose tiling]], with several symmetries but no periodic repetitions]]

[[Penrose tiling]]s, which use two different quadrilateral prototiles, are the best known example of tiles that forcibly create non-periodic patterns. They belong to a general class of [[aperiodic tiling]]s, which use tiles that cannot tessellate periodically. The [[recursion|recursive process]] of [[substitution tiling]] is a method of generating aperiodic tilings. One class that can be generated in this way is the [[rep-tile]]s; these tilings have surprising [[self-replication|self-replicating]] properties.{{sfn|Gardner|1989|pp=1-18}} [[Pinwheel tiling]]s are non-periodic, using a rep-tile construction; the tiles appear in infinitely many orientations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Radin, C. | title=The Pinwheel Tilings of the Plane | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] | volume=139 | issue=3 | pages=661–702 | date=May 1994 | url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.44.9723 | doi=10.2307/2118575 | jstor=2118575}}&lt;/ref&gt; It might be thought that a non-periodic pattern would be entirely without symmetry, but this is not so.

[[Image:wang tiles.svg|thumb|left|A set of 13 [[Wang tile]]s that tile the plane only [[aperiodic tiling|aperiodically]] ]]

[[Wang tile]]s are squares coloured on each edge, and placed so that abutting edges of adjacent tiles have the same colour; hence they are sometimes called Wang [[dominoes]]. A suitable set of Wang dominoes can tile the plane, but only aperiodically. This is known because any [[Turing machine]] can be represented as a set of Wang dominoes that tile the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt. Since the [[halting problem]] is undecidable, the problem of deciding whether a Wang domino set can tile the plane is also undecidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wang | first=Hao | author-link=Hao Wang (academic) | issue=1 | journal=[[Bell System Technical Journal]] | pages=1–41 | title=Proving theorems by pattern recognition—II | volume=40 | year=1961 | doi=10.1002/j.1538-7305.1961.tb03975.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Wang | first=Hao | author-link=Hao Wang (academic) | date=November 1965 |magazine=[[Scientific American]] | pages=98–106 | title=Games, logic and computers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Berger | first=Robert | authorlink=Robert Berger (mathematician) | journal=Memoirs of the American Mathematical Society| title=The undecidability of the domino problem | volume=66 | issue=66 | page=72 | date=1966 | doi=10.1090/memo/0066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Robinson | first=Raphael M. | authorlink=Raphael Robinson | journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]] | mr=0297572 | pages=177–209 | title=Undecidability and nonperiodicity for tilings of the plane | volume=12 | issue=3 | year=1971 | doi=10.1007/bf01418780| bibcode=1971InMat..12..177R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Culik | first=Karel, II | doi=10.1016/S0012-365X(96)00118-5 | issue=1–3 | journal=[[Discrete Mathematics (journal)|Discrete Mathematics]] | mr=1417576 | pages=245–251 | title=An aperiodic set of 13 Wang tiles | volume=160 | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Truchet base tiling.svg|thumb|upright|Random [[Truchet tile|Truchet tiling]] ]]

[[Truchet tiles]] are square tiles decorated with patterns so they do not have [[rotational symmetry]]; in 1704, [[Sébastien Truchet]] used a square tile split into two triangles of contrasting colours. These can tile the plane either periodically or randomly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Browne | first=Cameron | doi=10.1016/j.cag.2007.10.001 | issue=2 | journal=Computers &amp; Graphics | pages=268–281 | title=Truchet curves and surfaces | volume=32 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Smith | first=Cyril Stanley | authorlink=Cyril Stanley Smith | doi=10.2307/1578535 | issue=4 | journal=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] | pages=373–385 | title=The tiling patterns of Sebastian Truchet and the topology of structural hierarchy | volume=20 | year=1987| jstor=1578535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tessellations and colour===
{{further|Four color theorem|l1=Four colour theorem}}

[[File:Torus with seven colours.svg|thumb|right|If the colours of this tiling are to form a pattern by repeating this rectangle as the [[fundamental domain]], at least seven colours are required; more generally, at least [[four color theorem|four colours]] are needed.]]

Sometimes the colour of a tile is understood as part of the tiling; at other times arbitrary colours may be applied later. When discussing a tiling that is displayed in colours, to avoid ambiguity one needs to specify whether the colours are part of the tiling or just part of its illustration. This affects whether tiles with the same shape but different colours are considered identical, which in turn affects questions of symmetry. The [[four color theorem|four colour theorem]] states that for every tessellation of a normal [[Euclidean plane]], with a set of four available colours, each tile can be coloured in one colour such that no tiles of equal colour meet at a curve of positive length. The colouring guaranteed by the four colour theorem does not generally respect the symmetries of the tessellation. To produce a colouring which does, it is necessary to treat the colours as part of the tessellation. Here, as many as seven colours may be needed, as in the picture at right.&lt;ref name=Hazewinkel2001&gt;{{springer | title=Four-colour problem|id=p/f040970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tessellations with polygons===
[[File:Coloured Voronoi 2D.svg|thumb|upright|A [[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi tiling]], in which the cells are always convex polygons.]]

Next to the various [[tilings by regular polygons]], tilings by other polygons have also been studied.

Any triangle or [[quadrilateral]] (even [[concave polygon|non-convex]]) can be used as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, often in more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary [[quadrilateral]] can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric quadrilateral this tiling belongs to [[Wallpaper group#Group p2|wallpaper group p2]]. As [[fundamental domain]] we have the quadrilateral. Equivalently, we can construct a [[parallelogram]] subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the quadrilateral and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/DLDecArts.GramOrnJones | title=The Grammar of Ornament | publisher=Bernard Quaritch | last=Jones | first=Owen | authorlink=Owen Jones (architect) | year=1910 |edition=folio | origyear=1856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If only one shape of tile is allowed, tilings exists with convex ''N''-gons for ''N'' equal to 3, 4, 5 and 6. For {{nowrap|1=''N'' = 5}}, see [[Pentagonal tiling]], for {{nowrap|1=''N'' = 6}}, see [[Hexagonal tiling]],for {{nowrap|1=''N'' = 7}}, see [[Heptagonal tiling]] and for {{nowrap|1=''N'' = 8}}, see [[octagonal tiling]].

===Voronoi tilings===
[[Voronoi diagram|Voronoi or Dirichlet]] tilings are tessellations where each tile is defined as the set of points closest to one of the points in a discrete set of defining points. (Think of geographical regions where each region is defined as all the points closest to a given city or post office.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Aurenhammer, Franz |authorlink= Franz Aurenhammer | date=1991 | title=Voronoi Diagrams – A Survey of a Fundamental Geometric Data Structure | journal=ACM Computing Surveys | volume=23| issue =3 | pages=345–405 | doi=10.1145/116873.116880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Okabe, Atsuyuki |author2=Boots, Barry |author3=Sugihara, Kokichi |author4=Chiu, Sung Nok | date=2000 | title=Spatial Tessellations – Concepts and Applications of Voronoi Diagrams | edition=2nd | publisher=John Wiley | isbn=0-471-98635-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Voronoi cell'' for each defining point is a convex polygon.

It is possible to tessellate in [[non-Euclidean]] geometries such as [[hyperbolic geometry]]. A [[Uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane|uniform tiling in the hyperbolic plane]] (which may be regular, quasiregular or semiregular) is an edge-to-edge filling of the hyperbolic plane, with [[regular polygon]]s as [[Face (geometry)|faces]]; these are [[vertex-transitive]] ([[Transitive group action|transitive]] on its [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]]), and isogonal (there is an [[isometry]] mapping any vertex onto any other).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv | last1=Margenstern | first1=Maurice | title=Coordinates for a new triangular tiling of the hyperbolic plane | date=4 January 2011 | eprint=1101.0530 | class=cs.FL }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Tiling the Hyperbolic Plane with Regular Polygons | author=Zadnik,  Gašper | url=http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/TilingTheHyperbolicPlaneWithRegularPolygons/  | publisher=Wolfram | accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Uniform honeycombs in hyperbolic space|uniform honeycomb in hyperbolic space]] is a uniform tessellation of [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedral]] [[Cell (geometry)|cells]]. In 3-dimensional hyperbolic space there are nine [[Coxeter group]] families of compact [[convex uniform honeycomb]]s, generated as [[Wythoff construction]]s, and represented by [[permutation]]s of [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram#Application with uniform polytopes|rings]] of the [[Coxeter diagram]]s for each family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Coxeter, H.S.M. | work=The Beauty of Geometry: Twelve Essays | publisher=Dover Publications | date=1999 | isbn=0-486-40919-8 | title=Chapter 10: Regular honeycombs in hyperbolic space | pages=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tessellations frequently appeared in the graphic art of [[M. C.

These patterns can be described by [[Gilbert tessellation]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv | last1=Schreiber | first1=Tomasz | last2=Soja | first2=Natalia | eprint=1005.0023 | title=Limit theory for planar Gilbert tessellations | year=2010| class=math.PR }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as random crack networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gray | first1=N.

The model, named after [[Edgar Gilbert]], allows cracks to form starting from randomly scattered over the plane; each crack propagates in two opposite directions along a line through the initiation point, its slope chosen at random, creating a tessellation of irregular convex polygons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gilbert | first=E. N. | authorlink=Edgar Gilbert | editor-last=Noble | editor-first=B. | contribution=Random plane networks and needle-shaped crystals | location=New York | publisher=Macmillan | title=Applications of Undergraduate Mathematics in Engineering | year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basalt]]ic [[lava flow]]s often display [[Columnar basalt|columnar jointing]] as a result of [[Thermal expansion#Contraction effects|contraction]] forces causing cracks as the lava cools. The extensive crack networks that develop often produce hexagonal columns of lava. One example of such an array of columns is the [[Giant's Causeway]] in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weaire |first1=D. |last2=Rivier |first2=N. |title=Soap, cells and statistics: Random patterns in two dimensions |journal=Contemporary Physics |date=1984|volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=59–99 | authorlink=Denis Weaire |doi=10.1080/00107518408210979}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tessellated pavement]], a characteristic example of which is found at [[Eaglehawk Neck, Tasmania|Eaglehawk Neck]] on the [[Tasman Peninsula]] of [[Tasmania]], is a rare sedimentary rock formation where the rock has fractured into rectangular blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Branagan, D.F. | date=1983 | title=Tesselated pavements |editor1=Young, R.W. |editor2=Nanson, G.C. | pages=11–20 | work=Aspects of Australian sandstone landscapes.

Other natural patterns occur in [[foam]]s; these are packed according to [[Plateau's laws]], which require [[minimal surface]]s. Such foams present a problem in how to pack cells as tightly as possible: in 1887, [[Lord Kelvin]] proposed a packing using only one solid, the [[bitruncated cubic honeycomb]] with very slightly curved faces. In 1993, Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the [[Weaire–Phelan structure]], which uses less surface area to separate cells of equal volume than Kelvin's foam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ball, Philip | title=Shapes | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=2009 | pages=73–76 | isbn=978-0-199-60486-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tessellations have given rise to many types of [[tiling puzzle]], from traditional [[jigsaw puzzle]]s (with irregular pieces of wood or cardboard)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=McAdam | first1=Daniel | title=History of Jigsaw Puzzles | url=http://www.jigsaw-puzzle.org/jigsaw-puzzle-history.html | publisher=American Jigsaw Puzzle Society | accessdate=28 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211155914/http://www.jigsaw-puzzle.org/jigsaw-puzzle-history.html |archivedate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[tangram]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Tao of Tangram | last=Slocum | first=Jerry | year=2001 |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble | isbn=978-1-4351-0156-2 | page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; to more modern puzzles which often have a mathematical basis.

'''''The Channel of Gravelines, Petit Fort Philippe''''' is a [[Pointillism|pointillist]] painting by [[France|French]] artist [[Georges Seurat]], located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. Painted in 1890, the year before his death, it depicts a harbor in the small French port of [[Gravelines]].&lt;ref name=lee/&gt; Described as "wistful and poetic," it is one of the treasures of the IMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zivan|first=David|title=Fresh Paint|journal=[[Indianapolis Monthly]]|date=Dec 2006|pages=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=POsCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=seurat+gravelines+Petit+Fort+Philippe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qM02S9eVYy&amp;sig=oMS5LTRPQUa3koJN5eOuxk7h0K0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lEvyUK-tLdORqwHrfg&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCTgo#v=onepage&amp;q=seurat%20gravelines%20Petit%20Fort%20Philippe&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
As one of Seurat's final paintings, ''The Channel of Gravelines, Petit Fort Philippe'' demonstrates beautifully the principles of Seurat's own [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] movement. His systematic application of dots in colors carefully chosen according to laws of chromatic harmony results in unparalleled luminosity. Seurat painted a narrow border of darker dots around the edge of the canvas, heightening the brilliance of the light.&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Holliday T.|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art Collections Handbook|year=1988|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|isbn=0936260203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frame (a reproduction of Seurat's original design) with its vivid ultramarine base and dots echoing the adjacent canvas, enhances the colors still further.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=The Channel of Gravelines, Petit Fort Philippe|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/channel-gravelines-petit-fort-philippe-seurat-georges|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his careful control of the dots' color, Seurat also used their shape and density to achieve his vision. The extremely solid central [[bollard]] has the greatest density of dots, while the right side of the sky is so loosely covered that the white ground layer is visible. Based upon the bright light and stark shadows, Seurat painted in midafternoon.&lt;ref name=essay/&gt;

Although Seurat was quite faithful to the actual architecture of the harbor, to the extent that much of it is recognizable to this day, he arrayed the boats so their horizontal and vertical elements resulted in maximum visual stability.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elegant parabola of the wharf induces serenity. Stretching into infinity, it evokes the immensity of the sea. Simultaneously, the sweeping diagonal cutting the composition in two provides contrasting movement.&lt;ref name=webmuseum&gt;{{cite web|last=Pioch|first=Nicolas|title=Le port de Gravelines|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/seurat/gravelines/|publisher=[[WebMuseum]]|accessdate=13 January 2013|date=16 Jul 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Seurat's quest for aesthetic perfection can be seen in the number of alterations he made between his initial studies and the final painting. The central bollard anchors the composition securely, so solid as to be nearly graspable, but was missing from the panel study.&lt;ref name=herbert/&gt; Comparing the final canvas to the rest of his studies reveals that, in addition to arranging the boats in a neat, calm horizontal line, Seurat also tweaked the walkway to give the channel a greater role in the composition. Thus, sea, sky, and ground occupy roughly equal proportions.&lt;ref name=essay/&gt;

==Historical information==
While he spent most of the year shocking [[Paris]] with his novel style and views, Seurat spent his summers painting wistful seascapes. In 1890, he traveled to the tiny port of Gravelines, near the Belgian border, and painted what would be his last four landscapes.&lt;ref name=ima/&gt; That was two fewer paintings than he had produced the summer previous, perhaps because the broad coastal plain, marked only by dunes, was markedly different from his usual [[Normandy]] settings. The rise of the summer vacation meant artists found a ready market for seaside images. Unlike older artists such as [[Monet]], though, Seurat preferred utterly prosaic images of ports and shores, rather than more dramatic sunsets and stormy seas. The complete lack of humans, either vacationers or hardworking fishermen, was typical of Seurat's seascapes, which always had a luminous stillness.&lt;ref name=herbert&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbert|first=Robert L.|title=Seurat|year=1991|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=0870996185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIC728g8ps8C&amp;pg=PA349&amp;lpg=PA349&amp;dq=seurat+port+de+Gravelines&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vGg2ZJBjjm&amp;sig=CnLhWQLXuOvOURWD55vDecbyt_8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=txnzUNzmI8GCrAGS5oH4Ag&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=seurat%20port%20de%20Gravelines&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Seurat's choice of Gravelines was somewhat unusual, given that contemporary guidebooks described it as "an uninteresting town." Its very obscurity may have been a draw for the artist, who was growing protective of his methods. Also, its canal's straight lines lent themselves well to the strictly-organized compositions Seurat preferred.&lt;ref name=essay&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Ellen Wardwell|title=Seurat at Gravelines: The Last Landscapes|year=1990|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|isbn=0936260564}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Acquisition===
The painting was donated by [[Caroline Marmon Fesler]] in 1945 to the [[Herron School of Art]] in memory of her parents, [[Daniel W. Marmon|Daniel W.]] and Elizabeth C. Marmon. It was then claimed by the IMA during the separation of those institutions. It has the acquisition number 45.195.&lt;ref name=ima/&gt;

'''''The Dance II''''' by [[Henri Matisse]] is a [[triptych]] [[mural]] (15 ft high by 45 ft long) in the [[Barnes Foundation]]. It was created in 1932&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfagcity.com/2012/05/16/whats-so-special-about-the-barnes-collection/ ''New Barnes Building Opens, Why People are Upset'']&lt;/ref&gt; at the request of [[Albert C. Barnes]] after he met Matisse in the United  States. Barnes was an art enthusiast and long-time collector of Matisse's works, and agreed to pay Matisse a total of $30,000 for the mural, which was expected to take a year.&lt;ref name=flam&gt;Flam, Jack, ''Matisse: The Dance'', National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mural was to be placed above three arches spanning the windows of the main hall of Barnes' gallery. In Nice, France, Matisse executed the mural on canvas provided by Barnes, as opposed to working on site. This was an unusual approach for such a work, but the patron had offered him complete artistic freedom, and working onsite would in any event have been impractical. 

For Matisse, the project proved to be beset with difficulties, and would end up taking him two years, leaving him physically and emotionally drained. He was also profoundly disappointed to be told on installation that Barnes had no intention of exhibiting the work to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Spurling, Hilary, ''Matisse the Master'', Penguin Books, London, 2006 at 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Matisse was delighted with the work itself. In a 1933 letter to his son, Matisse wrote about the installation at the Barnes Foundation: "It has a splendour that one can't imagine unless one sees it -- because both the whole ceiling and its arched vaults come alive through radiation and the main effect continues right down to the floor...I am profoundly tired but very pleased. When I saw the canvas put in place, it was detached from me and became part of the building."&lt;ref name=flam/&gt;

Some commentators consider that ''The Dance II'' mural was pivotal in enabling Matisse to return to the most essential sources of his art.&lt;ref name=flam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bois, Y-A, “The Shift”, in Turner and Benjamin, eds, Matisse, Brisbane: QAG 1995 at 98&lt;/ref&gt; For Matisse, the work highlighted aspects such as simplicity, flattening, the emphasis on colour and the use of paper cut-outs which would all go on to play an important role in his later artistic development.&lt;ref&gt;"Strange encounters", in www.artinsociety.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Damage during world tour==
During a 1993 hearing in the Montgomery County, Pennsylvania Orphan's Court art conservator Paul R. Himmelstein argued that ''The Dance II'' suffered significant damages during a controversial world tour of highlights from the Barnes Foundation's collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=John|title=Art Held Hostage: The Battle Over the Barnes Collection|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]], a [[translation (geometry)|translation]] "slides" a thing by '''a''': ''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''a'''&lt;/sub&gt;('''p''') = '''p''' + '''a'''.

In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], continuous '''translational symmetry''' is the [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariance]] of a system of equations under any translation. Discrete translational [[symmetry]] is invariant under [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] translation.

Analogously an [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] ''A'' on functions is said to be translationally invariant with respect to a [[Translation (geometry)|translation operator]] &lt;math&gt;T_\delta&lt;/math&gt; if the result after applying ''A'' doesn't change if the argument function is translated.
More precisely it must hold that

:&lt;math&gt;\forall \delta \ A f = A (T_\delta f).\,&lt;/math&gt;

[[Laws of physics]] are translationally invariant under a spatial translation if they do not distinguish different points in space. According to [[Noether's theorem]], space translational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the [[momentum]] conservation law.

Translational symmetry of an object means that a particular translation does not change the object. For a given object, the translations for which this applies form a group, the [[symmetry group]] of the object, or, if the object has more kinds of symmetry, a subgroup of the symmetry group.

== Geometry ==
{{Lie groups}}
Translational invariance implies that, at least in one direction, the object is infinite: for any given point '''p''', the set of points with the same properties due to the translational symmetry form the infinite discrete set {'''p'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'''''a'''|''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''} = '''p'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;'''Z''' '''a'''. Fundamental domains are e.g. '''H'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1] '''a''' for any [[hyperplane]] '''H''' for which '''a''' has an independent direction. This is in 1D a [[line segment]], in 2D an infinite strip, and in 3D a slab, such that the vector starting at one side ends at the other side. Note that the strip and slab need not be perpendicular to the vector, hence can be narrower or thinner than the length of the vector.

In spaces with dimension higher than 1, there may be multiple translational symmetry. For each set of ''k'' independent translation vectors, the symmetry group is isomorphic with '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. 
In particular, the multiplicity may be equal to the dimension. This implies that the object is infinite in all directions. In this case, the set of all translations forms a [[lattice (group)|lattice]]. Different bases of translation vectors generate the same lattice [[if and only if]] one is transformed into the other by a matrix of integer coefficients of which the [[absolute value]] of the [[determinant]] is 1. The [[absolute value]] of the [[determinant]] of the matrix formed by a set of translation vectors is the hypervolume of the ''n''-dimensional [[parallelepiped]] the set subtends (also called the ''covolume'' of the lattice). This parallelepiped is a [[fundamental region]] of the symmetry: any pattern on or in it is possible, and this defines the whole object. 
See also [[lattice (group)]]. 

E.g. in 2D, instead of '''a''' and '''b''' we can also take '''a''' and '''a'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;'''b''', etc. In general in 2D, we can take ''p'''''a'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q'''''b''' and ''r'''''a'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''s'''''b''' for integers ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', and ''s'' such  that ''ps''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''qr'' is 1 or &amp;minus;1. This ensures that '''a''' and '''b''' themselves are integer linear combinations of the other two vectors. If not, not all translations are possible with the other pair. Each pair '''a''', '''b''' defines a parallelogram, all with the same area, the magnitude of the [[cross product]]. One parallelogram fully defines the whole  object. Without further symmetry, this parallelogram is a fundamental domain. The vectors '''a''' and '''b''' can be represented by complex numbers. For two given lattice points, equivalence of choices of a third point to generate a lattice shape is represented by the [[modular group]], see [[lattice (group)]].
 
Alternatively, e.g. a rectangle may define the whole object, even if the translation vectors are not perpendicular, if it has two sides parallel to one translation vector, while the other translation vector starting at one side of the rectangle ends at the opposite side.

For example, consider a tiling with equal rectangular tiles with an  asymmetric pattern on them, all oriented the same, in rows, with for each row a shift of a fraction, not one half, of a tile, always the same, then we have only translational symmetry, [[Wallpaper_group#Group_.22p1.22|wallpaper group ''p''1]] (the same applies without shift). With rotational symmetry of order two of the pattern on the tile we have ''p''2 (more symmetry of the pattern on the tile does not change that, because of the arrangement of the tiles). The rectangle is a more convenient unit to consider as fundamental domain (or set of two of them) than a parallelogram consisting of part of a tile and part of another one.

In 2D there may be translational symmetry in one direction for vectors of any length. One line, not in the same direction, fully defines the whole object. Similarly, in 3D there may be translational symmetry in one or two directions for vectors of any length. One plane ([[Cross-section (geometry)|cross-section]]) or line, respectively, fully defines the whole object.

For a given translation of space we can consider the corresponding translation of objects. The objects with at least the corresponding  translational symmetry are the [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of the latter, not to be confused with fixed points of the translation of space, which are non-existent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27720">The '''volume''' (W) and '''displacement''' (Δ) indicators have been discovered by [[Philippe Samyn]] in 1997 to help the search for the optimal geometry of architectural structures.

== The architectural structure ==
A resistant structure is anything amorphous or living, which supports the forces to which it is normally subjected without breaking. 
 
Characterised by its shape and its constituent materials, and three-dimensional by nature, the amorphous structure usually has a two-dimensional geometry, which is given a thickness, or a three-dimensional geometry (the three-dimensional structure). The latter is formed of a pair of two-dimensional structures on non-parallel planes or three-dimensional curved volumes as in the case for any living things, including a specific group: the shells (a three-dimensional surface with a thickness). An example of these is the structure of cars, boats or planes, or even human skulls, sea shells or the stem of a dandelion. 
 
The geometry of most "architectural" structures (such as buildings or bridges) is twodimensional and it is essential to study this aspect, whether for aesthetic, commodity-related or economic reasons. Several criteria are therefore taken into account in its definition.

== Objective ==
The study is limited to the quest of the geometry giving the structure of minimum volume.

The cost of a structure depends on the nature and the quantity of the materials used as well as the tools and human resources required for its production.

Although technological progress has reduced the cost of tools and the amount of human resources required, and despite the fact that computerised calculation tools can now be used to determine the dimension of a structure so that the load it bears at every point is within the admissible limits allowed by its constituent materials, it is also necessary for its geometry to be optimal. It is far from simple to find this optimal point because the choice available is so vast.

Furthermore, the resistance of the structure is not the only criterion to take into account. In many cases, it is also important to ensure that it will not undergo excessive deformation under static loads or that it does not vibrate to inconvenient or dangerous levels when subjected to dynamic loads.

Volume and displacement indocators, W and Δ, discovered by Philippe Samyn in August 1997, are useful tools in this regard. This approach does not take into account phenomena of elastic instability. Indeed, it can be shown that it is always possible to design a structure so that this effect becomes negligible.

== The indicators ==

The objective is to ascertain the optimal morphology for a two-dimensional structure with constant thickness, which:
* fits in a rectangle of pre-determined dimensions, longitudinal L and horizontal H, expressed in metres (m); 
* is made of one (or several) material(s) with a modulus of elasticity E, expressed in Pascals (Pa), and bearing a load at all points within its allowable stress(es) σ, expressed in Pascals (Pa);
* is resistant to the maximum loads to which it is subjected, in the form of a “resultant” F, expressed in Newtons (N).

Each form chosen corresponds to a volume of material V (in m³) and a maximum deformation δ (in m). 
Their calculation depends on the factors L, H, E, σ and F. These calculations are long and tedious, they cloud the objective of finding the optimal form.

It is, nevertheless, possible to overcome this problem by setting each factor to unity: while all other characteristics remain the same. Length L is therefore set to 1m, H to H/L, E and σ to 1Pa, and F to 1N.
This "reduced" structure has a volume of material W= σV/ FL (the volume indicator) and a maximum deformation Δ = Eδ / σL (the displacement indicator). Their main characteristic is that they are numbers without physical dimensions (dimensionless) and their value, for every morphology considered, depends only on the ratio L/H, i.e. the geometric slenderness ratio of the form.

This method can easily be applied to three-dimensional structures as illustrated in the following examples.

The theory related to the indicators has been taught since 2000, and among other institutions, at the department of Civil Engineering and of Architecture at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB ; section "material mechanics and constructions") leading to research and publications under the direction of Prof. Dr. Ir. Philippe Samyn (from 2000 to 2006); Prof. Dr. Ir. Willy Patrick De Wilde (from 2000 to 2011) and now Prof. Dr. Ir. Lincy Pyl.

The theory is open to everyone who wants to contribute, W and Δ being to be calculated for any resistant structure as defined in paragraph 1 here above. 
 
Progresses in material sciences, robotics and three dimensional printing, lead to the creation of new structural forms lighter than anyone known today. 
 
The geometry of minimal surfaces of constant thickness in a homogeneous material is, for example, substantially modified when thickness and/or local alloable stress are varying.

== Macrostructure, structural element, microstructure and material ==

The macrostructures considered here may be composed of "structural elements" which material presents a "microstructure".

Whether searching to limit the stress or the deformation, macrostructure, structural element and microstructure have each, a weight ''Vρ'', when ''ρ'' is the volumic weight of materials, in N/m³, function of the sollicitations {''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;} (for "force" in général) applied to them, of their size {''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;} (for length or "size" in general) , of their shape {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''} (for geometry or "shape" in general), and of their constituting material {''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} (for "material" in general).
{{clear}}
: &lt;math&gt;V\rho \div \{F_0\}\{L_0\}\{G_e\}\{M_a\}&lt;/math&gt;
{{clear}}
It can also be expressed as shape and material ({''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}{''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''}) defining the weight (''Vρ'') for the structure of a given size under given force ({''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}{''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}). 
{{clear}}
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{V\rho}{\{F_0\} \{L_0\}} \div \{G_e\} \{M_a\}&lt;/math&gt;
{{clear}}
In material mechanics and for the structural elements under a specific loading case, the factor  {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''} corresponds to the "form factor" for elements of continuous section out of a solid material (without voids).

The constituting material might however present a microstructure with voids. This cellular structure enhances than the form factor, whatever the loading case.

The factor {''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} caracterises a material which efficiency might be compared to another for a given loading case, and the independently of the form factor {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}.

The indicators ''W'' = ''σV''/''FL'' and Δ = ''δE''/''σL'' just defined, caracterise the macrostructures, while the same notations and symbols in small letters, ''w'' = ''σv''/''fl'' and Δ = ''δE''/''σl'', refer to the structural element.

The figure 1 gives the values of ''W'' and Δ for the structural element subject to traction, compression, bending and shear. The left column relates to the limitation of stress and the right column to the limitation of deformation. It shows the direct relation of ''W'' to {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}{''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} as:
{{clear}}
: &lt;math&gt;V\rho \div \{F_0\}\{L_0\}\{G_e\}\{M_a\} \div V\sigma \cdot \rho/\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;V\sigma \div \{F_0\}\{L_0\}\{G_e\}\{M_a\} \cdot \sigma/\rho .&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;W=\frac{\sigma V}{FL} \div \left[\frac{\{F_0\}} F\right] \left[\frac{\{L_0\}} L \right] \{G_e\}\{M_a\} \frac\sigma\rho,&lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt;W\div\{G_e\}\{M_a\}\sigma/\rho&lt;/math&gt; for given dimensions and loading case.

Then, as ''W'' and Δ depend only on &lt;math&gt;L/H&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;W=\frac{\sigma V}{FL}=\frac{\rho V}{FL}\frac{\sigma}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;

and:

: &lt;math&gt; W \frac \rho \sigma =\frac{\rho V}{FL} \div \{G_e\} \{M_a\}, &lt;/math&gt;

which for a given loading case, is the specific weight of a macrostructure per unit of force and length, depending only from the geometry through ''L/H'', and the materials though ''σ''/''ρ''.

''Wρ''/''σ'' includes thus, the material factor {''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} (''ρ''/''σ'' and ''ρ''/''E'' for tension and compression without buckling, ''ρ''/''E''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; for compression limited by buckling, ''ρ''/''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt; and ''ρ''/''E''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; for pure bending, ''ρ''{{sqrt|3/''σ''}} and ''ρ''/''G'' for pure shear) and the form factor {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''}.

All other factor being equal, a cluster of tubes with a diameter ''H'' and a wall thickness ''e'',  compared to a solid bar of equal volume in a material caracterised by ''ρ'' , ''σ'' , ''E''  et ''G'' , presents an apparent density ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 4''k''(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'')''ρ'' with ''k'' = ''e''/''H'', allowable stress  ''σ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 4''k''(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'')''σ'',

The [[Young's modulus]] is &lt;math&gt;\ E_a=4k(1-k)E&lt;/math&gt; and the [[shear modulus]] is &lt;math&gt;\ G_a=4k(1-k)G&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus

: &lt;math&gt;\ \rho_a/E_a^{1/2}=2\sqrt{k-k^2}\rho/E^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;\rho_a/\sigma_a^{2/3}=(4k-4k^2)^{1/3}\rho/\sigma^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt;

This explains the better performances of lighter materials for structural elements subject to compression or bending. 
 
This indicator allows to compare the efficiency of macrostructures including geometry and material.

It echos the work of M.F. Ashby: "Materials Selection in Mechanical Design" (1992).&lt;ref&gt;M.F. Ashby, ''Materials Selection in Mechanical Design'', 311 pages, 1997. Butterworth-Heinemann edition, division of Reed Educational and Professional Publishing Ltd. Oxford (first edition in 1992 by Pergamon Press Ltd), UK.&lt;/ref&gt; He analyses {''G&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''} and {''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} separately as, for his studies, {''M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''} relates to a large amount of the materials physical properties.

Different and complementary, it can also be placed alongside work carried out since 1969 by the Institut Für Leichte Flächentragwerke in Stuttgart under the direction of Frei Otto and now Werner SobekK, which refers to indices named ''Tra'' and ''Bic''.&lt;ref&gt;''Il Publikationen: Institut Für Leichte Flächentragwerke'', Universität Stuttgart, plaffenwaldring, 14, 70569 Stuttgart; (Current director: Prof. Dr. Ir. Werner Sobek). tel 00.49.711.685.35.99 – fax 00.49.711.685.37.89&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tra'' is defined as the product of the length of the trajectory of the force ''F&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'', (causing the collapse of the structure) onto the supports by the intensity of this force, and the ''Bic'' is the relationship of the mass of the structure with ''Tra''.

Since ''ρ*''  is the density of the material (in kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and  ''α'' is, like ''W'', a constant depending on the type of structure and the loading case: 

: &lt;math&gt;Bic=\rho^* V/Tra \text{ and } Tra=F_rL/\alpha; &lt;/math&gt;

therefore, with stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_r&lt;/math&gt; reached under &lt;math&gt;F_r&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;Bic=\alpha\frac{\rho^* V}{F_r L} = \alpha \frac{\rho^*} \sigma \frac{F}{F_r}W&lt;/math&gt;

and as

: &lt;math&gt;\ \frac F {F_r} = \frac \sigma {\sigma_r}\ :\ Bic=\frac{\rho^*}{\sigma_r}\alpha W. &lt;/math&gt;

Unlike ''W'' , which is dimensionless, ''Bic'' is expressed in ''kg/Nm''. Therefore, depending on the material, an independent comparison of different morphologies is not possible. 
It is surprising to note that despite the abundance of their works, none of them mention or make any effort to study ''W'' and its relationship with ''L/H''.

== Validity limits of ''W'' and Δ ==

* In general, the second order effects have very little influence on ''W'',  but they can have a significant impact on Δ. ''W'' and Δ therefore also depend on ''E/σ''.

* The shearing force ''T'' may be crucial in the case of short and continuous elements, subject to bending so that ''W'' does not fall below a given value, regardless of the reduction of the slenderness ''L/H''. However, this limitation is very theoretical because it is always possible to remove it by transferring material from the flanges to the web of the section, close to the supports.

* The stress ''σ'' to which the structure can be subjected depends on the nature, the internal geometry, the production method and the implementation of the materials, as well as several other factors, including the dimensional accuracy of the actual construction, the nature of the connections of the components or their fire resistance, but also the skill with which the geometry of the structure is designed to cope with elastic instability. Pierre Latteur,&lt;ref&gt;P. Latteur, ''Optimisation des treillis, arcs, poutres et câbles sur base d'indicateurs morphologiques – Application aux structures soumises en partie ou en totalité au flambement'', Tome I: Thesis, 328 p.; Tome II: Thesis appendix, 12 p.; Tome III: Appendix to chapter 2, 432 p. (May 2000). Ph.D. Thesis in Applied Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Brussel.&lt;/ref&gt; who discovered the buckling indicator, studied the influence of elastic instability on ''W'' and Δ.
In this regard, it is important to note that the existence of anchoring points of an element in traction may reduce the apparent permissible stress to the same level as the reduction necessary to take into account a moderate level of elastic instability. 
The influence on ''W'' of the buckling of the compressed parts on one side and of the anchoring points at the extremities of an element in traction on the other side is analysed on pages 30 to 58 in the « reference book ».

* The allowable stress ''σ'' is also often reduced by the need to limit the displacement ''δ'' of the structure since it is not possible to significantly alter ''E'' for a given material.

* Considerations regarding fatigue, ductility and dynamic forces also limit the working stress.

* It is not always straightforward to establish the nature and the overall maximum intensity of the forces ''F''(including dead weight) to which the structure is subject, which again has a direct influence on the working stress.

* The connections of an element in compression or in traction are considered as hinged. Any clamping, even partial ones, introduce parasitic forces which add extra weight to the structure.

* For certain types of the structures, the volume of the connections adds to the net volume defined by ''W''. Its importance depends on the nature of the material and the context in which it is used; this needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis. 
It follows that initially, only ''W'' and Δ should be taken into account for the morphological design of a structure, assuming that it is ultra-dampened (i.e. its internal damping is greater than the critical damping), which makes it impervious to dynamic stress. 
The volume ''V'' of a structure is therefore directly proportional to the total intensity of the force ''F'' which is applied to it, to its length ''L'' and to the morphological factor ''W''; it is inversely proportional to the stress ''σ'' to which it can be subjected. Furthermore, the weight of a structure is proportional to the density ''ρ'' of the material from which it is constructed. However, its maximum displacement ''δ'' remains proportional to the span ''L'' and the morphological factor Δ, as well as the ratio between its working stress ''σ'' and the modulus of elasticity ''E''.

If it is a case of limiting the weight (or the volume) and the deformation of a structure for a given stress ''F'' and span ''L'', with all other aspects remaining unchanged, then the work of the structural engineer involves minimising ''W'' and ''ρ/σ'' on one side and Δ and ''σ/E'' ont the other.

== Accuracy of ''W'' and Δ ==

=== Theoretical accuracy ===
For the large majority of compressed elements, it is possible to limit the reduction of the working stress to 25% by taking into account elastic instability, providing that the designer focuses on ensuring an efficient geometric design from as early as the initial sketches. This means that the increase in their volume indicator can also be limited to 25% . The volume of the elements subject to pure traction is also only very rarely limited to the product of the net distance over which a force is applied by a section strained at the permissible stress. In other words, their real volume indicator is thus also higher than the one which results from the calculation of ''W''.  A bar under traction can be welded at its extremities; no extra material apart from the negligible welding material is added, but the rigidity introduce parasitic moments which absorb some of the permissible stress.

The bar can be articulated at its extremities and work at its permissible stress, but this requires close end sockets or attachment mechanisms whose volume is far from negligible, especially if the bar is short or highly stressed. As L.H. Cox demonstrated,&lt;ref&gt;L.H. Cox, ''The design of structures of least weight'', 135 p., 1965, Pergamon Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; in this case, it is worth taking into account ''n'' bars each with a cross-section of Ω/''n'', strained by force ''F/n'' with 2''n'' sockets, instead of one bar with a cross-section Ω strained by a force ''F'' with 2 sockets, since the total volume of 2''n'' sockets in the first case is much less than that of 2 sockets in the second.

The anchoring of the extremities of a bar under traction can also be ensured by adherence, as is usually the case for the rebars in elements made of reinforced concrete. In this specific case, it is necessary to have an anchoring length at least 30 times the diameter of the bar. The bar then has a length ''L''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;60''H'' for a useful length ''L''; its theoretical volume indicator ''W'' = 1 becomes ''W'' = 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;60''H''/''L''. Consequently, ''L''/''H'' must be greater than 240 (which is always theoretically possible) so that ''W'' does not increase by more than 25%. This observation also helps to show another reason for taking into account n bars with a crosssection Ω/''n'' instead of one bar with a cross-section&amp;nbsp;Ω.

Finally, connections consisting of bolts, dowels, pins or nails, especially in the case of wooden components, significantly reduce usable sections. For elements in traction, a reduction of 25% in the working stress or an increase of 25% in the volume is therefore also necessary in the majority of cases. Determining the volume and the displacement of a structure using the indicators ''W'' and Δ is therefore reliable theoretically, providing that:

* the working stress is reduced by at least 25% ;

* de dessiner les éléments comprimés et les assemblages avec discernement.

* great attention is paid to the design of compressed parts and connections. The overall proportions of an optimised structure, without taking buckling into account, are significantly altered when the compressed bars need to be shortened to take account of elastic instability. It becomes sensitive to the scale effect, leading to an extension of the overall proportion and increasing the weight of the structure. Inversely, a shortening of the overall proportions is necessary when the volume of the connections needs to be considered, since the influence of this volume reduces when the bars are lengthened. This shows the advantage of accurately designing not only the compressed parts, but also the connections, in order to avoid these flaws. One of Niki de Saint-Phalle’s light sculptures are therefore preferable to Giacometti’s slender but heavy structures !

=== Practical accuracy ===

The volume of the material of the structure, as determined using ''W'', can only be obtained accurately if the theoretical values of the relevant characteristic of the sections under strain ''σ'' can be measured in practice.
As shown in Figure 1 above, this characteristic is:

* ''Ω'' for an element under pure compression without buckling ;
* ''I'' for an element under pure compression with buckling (as well as for deformation under
pure bending) ;
* ''I''/''H'' for an element under simple bending.

It is always possible to obtain the precise value of these characteristics when the parts are made of moulded materials, such as reinforced concrete, or squared-off materials, such as wood or stone. However, this is not the case for laminated or extruded materials, produced on an industrial production line, such as steel or aluminium. It is important therefore to produce these elements with the smallest possible difference in size between two of them in order to avoid an unnecessary use of material. This use is consistent when the related deviation ''c'' between two successive values ''k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; is constant, thus (''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) / ''k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''c'' or ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = (''c''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) ''k&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = {{math|(''c''+1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

This is the principle of the geometric series known as the Renard Series (named after Colonel Renard who was the first to use them in calculating the diameter of cabling on aircraft) featured in the French standard NF X01-002.&lt;ref&gt;French National Association for Standardisation (Association Française de Normalisation/AFNOR), ''NFX 01-002  Guide pour le choix des séries de nombres normaux et des séries comportant des valeurs plus arrondies de nombres normaux'', 6 pages, December 1967, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; When all the necessary values are only very slightly greater than a series value, ''c'' represents the maximum increase and ''c''/2 the average increase of ''W''. Being universally used, the case of the steel profiles requires an in-depth examination (see the “reference book”; page 26 to 29). Consequently, the use of industrial steel profiles automatically leads to a significant increase of ''W'':

* by half of the theoretical inaccuracy for pure compression ;
* practically identical for bending or compression subject to buckling.

This situation is magnified when the number of profiles available is restricted, which may explain the use of forms which are not theoretically optimal but which tend to subject the available profiles to the permissible stress ''σ'' (such as, for example, pylons for high-voltage electric lines or variable height truss bridges). For structures subject to pure bending, this also explains the use of flat plates of variable lengths added to the flanges of these ''I'' profiles to obtain the inertia or resisting moment required, with the greatest degree of accuracy. Conversely, the significant variety in the tubes available enables a relative deviation value ''c'' which is both smaller and more constant. They also cover a much wider range in both the lower and higher characteristic values. Since their geometric performance is practically identical to that of the I profiles, tubes are the most appropriate industrial solution in order to practically eliminate any increase in the volume indicator ''W''. Nevertheless, practical issues of availability and corrosion may limit their use.

== Some examples of ''W'' and Δ ==

It is surprising to note that the minimum value is reached for a conical dome of variable thickness with an opening angle of 90° (''L''/''H'' = 2 ; ''W'' = 0,5!).

== Developments ==
Applications discussed in the « reference book » are:
* trusses,
* straight continuous beams,
* arches, cables and guyed structures,
* masts,
* gantries,
* membranes of revolution.

== Some examples of composite structures with minimum W ==
''W'' can easily be determined in order to optimise structures made up of a number of different construction elements (see « reference book » pages 100–106) as shown, for instance, for the wind turbine in Figure 8.

The '''Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art''', formally the '''Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art''' and sometimes referred to as the '''Washington Declaration''' is a statement concerning the restitution of art confiscated by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime in Germany]] before and during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Statement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rt/hlcst/270431.htm|title=Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in connection with the Washington Conference on Holocaust Era Assets, held in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States, on 3 December 1998.&lt;ref name="Statement" /&gt;

== The Conference ==

The conference was hosted by the [[United States Department of State]] and the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]].&lt;ref name="USF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/index.HTM |title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assembled participants from a 1995 New York symposium, [[The Spoils of War (symposium)|The Spoils of War—World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property]], along with others,&lt;ref name="USF" /&gt; and built on the Nazi Gold conference which had been held in [[London]] in December 1997.&lt;ref name="USF" /&gt;

The 1998 conference's aim was to discuss Jewish losses in particular, including artworks, books, and archives, as well as insurance claims and other types of assets.&lt;ref name="USF" /&gt; 44 governments, including the [[German reunification|reunified Germany]], sent delegates,&lt;ref name="Eizenstat 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/heac.htm |title=05/20/99: Eizenstat Briefing on Holocaust-Era Assets Conference |last=Eizenstat |first=Stuart E. |work=[[University of South Florida]] |date=20 May 1999 |accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did thirteen international non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref name="USF" /&gt; The conference organizer was the U.S. [[Under Secretary of State for Economic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs]], [[Stuart E. Eizenstat]],&lt;ref name="USF" /&gt; who had previously been [[United States Ambassador to the European Union]],&lt;ref name="Covington"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cov.com/seizenstat/|title=Stuart E. Eizenstat|publisher=Covington &amp; Burling|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its chairman was Judge [[Abner Mikva]].&lt;ref name="Eizenstat 2" /&gt; U.S. [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Madeleine Albright]] gave the opening address.&lt;ref name="Albright"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/981201.htm|title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets|last=Albright|first=Madeleine K.|date=1 December 1998|publisher=[[University of South Florida]]|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Principles ==

The statement includes eleven numbered principles, prefixed:&lt;ref name="Statement" /&gt;

{{Quote|In developing a consensus on non-binding principles to assist in resolving issues relating to Nazi-confiscated art, the Conference recognizes that among participating nations there are differing legal systems and that countries act within the context of their own laws.}}

The principles are:&lt;ref name="Statement" /&gt;

# Art that had been confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted should be identified.
# Relevant records and archives should be open and accessible to researchers, in accordance with the guidelines of the International Council on Archives.
# Resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted.
# In establishing that a work of art had been confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted, consideration should be given to unavoidable gaps or ambiguities in the provenance in light of the passage of time and the circumstances of the Holocaust era.
# Every effort should be made to publicize art that is found to have been confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted in order to locate its pre-War owners or their heirs.
# Efforts should be made to establish a central registry of such information.
# Pre-War owners and their heirs should be encouraged to come forward and make known their claims to art that was confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted.
# If the pre-War owners of art that is found to have been confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted, or their heirs, can be identified, steps should be taken expeditiously to achieve a just and fair solution, recognizing this may vary according to the facts and circumstances surrounding a specific case.
# If the pre-War owners of art that is found to have been confiscated by the Nazis, or their heirs, can not be identified, steps should be taken expeditiously to achieve a just and fair solution.
# Commissions or other bodies established to identify art that was confiscated by the Nazis and to assist in addressing ownership issues should have a balanced membership.
# Nations are encouraged to develop national processes to implement these principles, particularly as they relate to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms for resolving ownership issues.

The Principles were outlined by Eizenstat, along with "Declarations of the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research."&lt;ref name="USF" /&gt; He also gave a statement at the conference, titled ''In Support of Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art'', saying:&lt;ref name="Eizenstat"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/art.htm|title=12/03/98: Eizenstat -- Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art|last=Eizenstat|first=Stuart E.|date=3 December 1998|publisher=[[University of South Florida]]|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote| Several weeks ago, we prepared a discussion paper of 11 general principles, which was used as the basis of extensive consultations and which all of you have today. These principles are not, in themselves, a solution. They are a means by which nations can fashion their own solutions consistent with their own legal systems. The principles try to capture the spirit of this conference for nations engaging in this task.

If these principles are properly applied, the discovery of Nazi-confiscated art will no longer be a matter of chance. Instead, there will be an organized international effort -- voluntary in nature but backed by a strong moral commitment -- to search provenance and uncover stolen art. This effort will be undertaken by governments, NGOs, museums, auctioneers and dealers. }}
