In [[programming languages]], '''ad hoc polymorphism'''&lt;ref&gt;C. Strachey, [http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jajones/INF102-S18/readings/05_stratchey_1967.pdf Fundamental concepts in programming languages]. Lecture notes for International Summer School in Computer Programming, Copenhagen, August 1967&lt;/ref&gt; is a kind of [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] in which polymorphic functions can be applied to arguments of different types, because a polymorphic function can denote a number of distinct and potentially heterogeneous implementations depending on the type of argument(s) to which it is applied. It is also known as [[function overloading]] or [[operator overloading]]. The term [[ad hoc]] in this context is not intended to be pejorative; it refers simply to the fact that this type of polymorphism is not a fundamental feature of the [[type system]]. This is in contrast to [[parametric polymorphism]], in which polymorphic functions are written without mention of any specific type, and can thus apply a single abstract implementation to any number of types in a transparent way. This classification was introduced by [[Christopher Strachey]] in 1967.

==Early binding==
Ad hoc polymorphism is a [[dynamic dispatch|dispatch]] mechanism: control moving through one named function is dispatched to various other functions without having to specify the exact function being called. Overloading allows multiple functions taking different types to be defined with the same name; the [[compiler]] or [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] automatically ensures that the right function is called. This way, functions appending lists of integers, lists of strings, lists of real numbers, and so on could be written, and all be called ''append''&amp;mdash;and the right ''append'' function would be called based on the type of lists being appended. This differs from parametric polymorphism, in which the function would need to be written ''generically'', to work with any kind of list. Using overloading, it is possible to have a function perform two completely different things based on the type of input passed to it; this is not possible with parametric polymorphism. Another way to look at overloading is that a routine is uniquely identified not by its name, but by the combination of its name and the number, order and types of its parameters.

This type of polymorphism is common in [[object-oriented programming]] languages, many of which allow [[operator (programming)|operator]]s to be overloaded in a manner similar to functions (see [[operator overloading]]). Some languages that are not dynamically typed and lack ad hoc  polymorphism (including type classes) have longer function names such as &lt;code&gt;print_int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;print_string&lt;/code&gt;, etc. This can be seen as advantage (more descriptive) or a disadvantage (overly verbose) depending on one's point of view.

An advantage that is sometimes gained from overloading is the appearance of specialization, e.g., a function with the same name can be implemented in multiple different ways, each optimized for the particular data types that it operates on. This can provide a convenient interface for code that needs to be specialized to multiple situations for performance reasons. The downside is that the type system cannot guarantee the consistency of the different implementations.

Since overloading is done at compile time, it is not a substitute for [[late binding]] as found in [[subtyping polymorphism]].

==Late binding==
The previous section notwithstanding, there are other ways in which ''ad hoc'' polymorphism can work out. Consider for example the Smalltalk language. In [[Smalltalk]], the overloading is done at run time, as the methods ("function implementation") for each overloaded message ("overloaded function") are resolved when they are about to be executed. This happens at run time, after the program is compiled. Therefore, polymorphism is given by [[subtyping polymorphism]] as in other languages, and it is also extended in functionality by ''ad hoc'' polymorphism at run time.

A closer look will also reveal that Smalltalk provides a slightly different variety of ''ad hoc'' polymorphism. Since Smalltalk has a late bound execution model, and since it provides objects the ability to handle messages that are not understood, it is possible to go ahead and implement functionality using polymorphism without explicitly overloading a particular message. This may not be generally recommended practice for everyday programming, but it can be quite useful when implementing proxies.

Also, while in general terms common class method and constructor overloading is not considered polymorphism, there are more uniform languages in which classes are regular objects. In Smalltalk, for instance, classes are regular objects. In turn, this means messages sent to classes can be overloaded, and it is also possible to create objects that behave like classes without their classes inheriting from the hierarchy of classes. These are effective techniques which can be used to take advantage of Smalltalk's powerful reflection capabilities. Similar arrangements are also possible in languages such as [[Self (programming language)|Self]] and Newspeak.

==Example==
Imagine an operator &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; that may be used in the following ways:
# &lt;code&gt;1 + 2 = 3&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;3.14 + 0.0015 = 3.1415&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;1 + 3.7 = 4.7&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;[true, false] + [false, true] = [true, false, false, true]&lt;/code&gt;
# &lt;code&gt;"bab" + "oon" = "baboon"&lt;/code&gt;

===Overloading===
To handle these six function calls, four different pieces of code are needed&amp;mdash;or ''three'', if strings are considered to be lists of characters:
* In the first case, [[integer (computer science)|integer]] addition must be invoked.
* In the second and third cases, [[floating point|floating-point]] addition must be invoked (with [[type promotion]], or [[type coercion]], in the third case).
* In the fourth and fifth cases, [[List (computing)|list]] [[concatenation]] must be invoked.
* In the last case, [[literal string|string]] concatenation must be invoked.
Thus, the name &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; actually refers to three or four completely different functions. This is an example of ''overloading''.
(Note that string types used in the last case do not, by themselves, lend themselves to the programmer ''naturally'' assuming concatenation, rather than addition, is meant; consider "123" + "456", which might reasonably be expected to yield "579". Overloading can therefore provide different meaning, or semantics, for an operation, as well as differing implementations.)

'''Air–fuel ratio''' ('''AFR''') is the mass ratio of [[air]] to a solid, liquid, or gaseous [[fuel]] present in a [[combustion]] process. The combustion may take place in a controlled  manner such as in an [[internal combustion engine]] or industrial furnace, or may result in an explosion (e.g., a [[dust explosion]], [[gas explosion|gas or vapour explosion]] or in a [[Thermobaric_weapon#Fuel-air_explosive|thermobaric weapon]]). 

The air-fuel ratio determines whether a mixture is combustible at all, how much energy is being released, and how much unwanted pollutants are produced in the reaction. Typically a range of fuel to air ratios exists, outside of which ignition will not occur. These are known as the lower and upper explosive limits.

In an [[internal combustion engine]] or industrial furnace, the air-fuel ratio is an important measure for anti-pollution and performance-tuning reasons. If exactly enough air is provided to completely burn all of the fuel, the ratio is known as the  [[stoichiometric]] mixture, often abbreviated to '''stoich'''. Ratios lower than stoichiometric are considered "rich". Rich mixtures are less efficient, but may produce more power and burn cooler. Ratios higher than stoichiometric are considered "lean." Lean mixtures are more efficient but may cause higher temperatures, which can lead to the formation of [[nitrogen oxide]]s. Some engines are designed with features to allow [[lean-burn]]. For precise air-fuel ratio calculations, the [[oxygen]] content of combustion air should be specified because of different [[density of air|air density]] due to different altitude or intake air temperature, possible dilution by ambient [[water vapor]], or enrichment by oxygen additions.

== Internal combustion engines==

In theory a stoichiometric mixture has just enough air to completely burn the available fuel. In practice this is never quite achieved, due primarily to the very short time available in an internal combustion engine for each combustion cycle. Most of the combustion process is completed in approximately 2 milliseconds at an engine speed of {{val|fmt=commas|6000|ul=revolutions per minute}}. (100 revolutions per second; 10 milliseconds per revolution) This is the time that elapses from the spark plug firing until 90% of the fuel–air mix is combusted, typically some 80 degrees of crankshaft rotation later. [[Catalytic converter]]s are designed to work best when the [[exhaust gas]]es passing through them are the result of nearly perfect combustion.

A stoichiometric mixture unfortunately burns very hot and can damage engine components if the engine is placed under high load at this fuel–air mixture. Due to the high temperatures at this mixture, detonation of the fuel–air mix while approaching or shortly after maximum cylinder pressure is possible under high load (referred to as [[Engine knocking|knocking]] or pinging), specifically a "pre-detonation" event in the context of a spark-ignition engine model. Such detonation can cause serious engine damage as the uncontrolled burning of the fuel air mix can create very high pressures in the cylinder. As a consequence, stoichiometric mixtures are only used under light to low-moderate load conditions.  For acceleration and high load conditions, a richer mixture (lower air–fuel ratio) is used to produce cooler combustion products and thereby prevent detonation and overheating of the cylinder head.

==Engine management systems==
The [[stoichiometric]] mixture for a gasoline engine is the ideal ratio of air to fuel that burns all fuel with no excess air. For [[gasoline]] fuel, the stoichiometric air–fuel mixture is about 14.7:1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hillier | first = V.A.W. | last2 = Pittuck | first2 = F.W. | year = 1966 | title = Fundamentals of Motor Vehicle Technology | chapter = Sub-section 3.2 | publisher = [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson Educational]] | location = London | isbn = 0 09 110711 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. for every one gram of fuel, 14.7 grams of air are required. The fuel oxidation reaction is:
:25&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; → 16&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 18&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + energy
Any mixture greater than 14.7:1 is considered a [[lean burn|lean mixture]]; any less than 14.7:1 is a [[Rich burn|rich mixture]] – given perfect (ideal) "test" fuel (gasoline consisting of solely ''n''-[[heptane]] and [[iso-octane]]). In reality, most fuels consist of a combination of heptane, octane, a handful of other [[alkanes]], plus additives including detergents, and possibly oxygenators such as MTBE ([[methyl tert-butyl ether]]) or [[ethanol]]/[[methanol]]. These compounds all alter the stoichiometric ratio, with most of the additives pushing the ratio downward (oxygenators bring extra oxygen to the combustion event in liquid form that is released at time of combustions; for  [[MTBE]]-laden fuel, a stoichiometric ratio can be as low as 14.1:1). Vehicles that use an [[oxygen sensor]] or other feedback loop to control fuel to air ratio (lambda control), compensate automatically for this change in the fuel's stoichiometric rate by measuring the exhaust gas composition and controlling fuel volume. Vehicles without such controls (such as most motorcycles until recently, and cars predating the mid-1980s) may have difficulties running certain fuel blends (especially winter fuels used in some areas) and may require different jets (or otherwise have the fueling ratios altered) to compensate. Vehicles that use [[oxygen sensor]]s can monitor the air–fuel ratio with an [[air–fuel ratio meter]].

== Other types of engines ==
In the typical air to natural gas combustion burner, a double cross limit strategy is employed to ensure ratio control. (This method was used in World War II).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The strategy involves adding the opposite flow feedback into the limiting control of the respective gas (air or fuel). This assures ratio control within an acceptable margin.

== Other terms used ==
There are other terms commonly used when discussing the mixture of air and fuel in internal combustion engines.

===Mixture===
'''Mixture''' is the predominant word that appears in training texts, operation manuals and maintenance manuals in the aviation world.

=== Air–fuel ratio (AFR) {{Anchor|Air-fuel ratio}} ===
The '''air–fuel ratio''' is the most common reference term used for mixtures in internal combustion engines.  The term is also used to define mixtures used for industrial furnace heated by combustion.  The AFR in mass units is employed in [[fuel oil]] fired furnaces, while volume (or [[mole (unit)|mole]]) units are used for [[natural gas]] fired furnaces.

:&lt;math&gt;\text{AFR} = \frac{m_\text{air}}{m_\text{fuel}}&lt;/math&gt;

Air–fuel ratio is the ratio between the ''mass'' of air and the mass of fuel in the fuel–air mix at any given moment. The mass is the mass of all constituents that compose the fuel and air, whether combustible or not. For example, a calculation of the mass of natural gas—which often contains [[carbon dioxide]] ({{chem|CO|2}}), [[nitrogen]] ({{chem|N|2}}), and various [[alkanes]]—includes the mass of the carbon dioxide, nitrogen and all alkanes in determining the value of ''m''&lt;sub&gt;fuel&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;See Example 15.3 in {{cite book| last = Çengel | first = Yunus A. | last2 = Boles | first2 = Michael A. | title = Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach | edition = 5th | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill]] | location = Boston | year = 2006 | url = http://www.abebooks.com/Thermodynamics-Engineering-Approach-5th-Cengel-Yunus/1943380167/bd | isbn = 9780072884951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For pure [[octane]] the stoichiometric mixture is approximately 15.1:1, or ''λ'' of 1.00 exactly.

In naturally aspirated engines powered by octane, maximum power is frequently reached at AFRs ranging from 12.5 to 13.3:1 or ''λ'' of 0.850 to 0.901.

Air-fuel ratio of 12:1 is considered as maximum output ratio, where as the air-fuel ratio of 16:1 is considered as maximum fuel economy ratio.

=== Fuel–air ratio (FAR) {{Anchor|Fuel-air ratio}} ===
'''Fuel–air ratio''' is commonly used in the [[gas turbine]] industry as well as in government studies of [[internal combustion engine]], and refers to the ratio of fuel to the air.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{FAR} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{AFR}}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Air–fuel equivalence ratio (''λ''){{Anchor|Air-fuel equivalence ratio}} ===
Air–fuel equivalence ratio, ''λ'' (lambda), is the ratio of actual AFR to stoichiometry for a given mixture. ''λ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.0 is at stoichiometry, rich mixtures ''λ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.0, and lean mixtures ''λ''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.0.

There is a direct relationship between ''λ'' and AFR. To calculate AFR from a given ''λ'', multiply the measured ''λ'' by the stoichiometric AFR for that fuel. Alternatively, to recover ''λ'' from an AFR, divide AFR by the stoichiometric AFR for that fuel. This last equation is often used as the definition of ''λ'':

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{\mathrm{AFR}}{\mathrm{AFR}_\text{stoich}}&lt;/math&gt;

Because the composition of common fuels varies seasonally, and because many modern vehicles can handle different fuels, when tuning, it makes more sense to talk about ''λ'' values rather than AFR.

Most practical AFR devices actually measure the amount of residual oxygen (for lean mixes) or unburnt hydrocarbons (for rich mixtures) in the exhaust gas.

===Fuel–air equivalence ratio (''ϕ''){{Anchor|Fuel-air equivalence ratio}}===
The '''fuel–air equivalence ratio''', ''ϕ'' (phi), of a system is defined as the ratio of the fuel-to-oxidizer ratio to the stoichiometric fuel-to-oxidizer ratio. Mathematically,

:&lt;math&gt; \phi = \frac{\mbox{fuel-to-oxidizer ratio}}{(\mbox{fuel-to-oxidizer ratio})_\text{st}} = \frac{m_\text{fuel}/m_\text{ox}}{\left(m_\text{fuel}/m_\text{ox}\right)_\text{st}} = \frac{n_\text{fuel}/n_\text{ox}}{\left(n_\text{fuel}/n_\text{ox}\right)_\text{st}}&lt;/math&gt;

where, ''m'' represents the mass, ''n'' represents number of moles, suffix st stands for stoichiometric conditions.

The advantage of using equivalence ratio over fuel–oxidizer ratio is that it takes into account (and is therefore independent of) both mass and molar values for the fuel and the oxidizer. Consider, for example,  a mixture of one mole of [[ethane]] ({{chem|C|2|H|6}}) and one mole of [[oxygen]] ({{chem|O|2}}). The fuel–oxidizer ratio of this mixture based on the mass of fuel and air is

:&lt;math chem&gt; \frac{m_\ce{C2H6}}{m_\ce{O2}} = \frac{1 \times (2\times12+6\times1)}{1 \times (2\times16)} = \frac{30}{32} = 0.9375&lt;/math&gt;

and the fuel-oxidizer ratio of this mixture based on the number of moles of fuel and air is

:&lt;math chem&gt; \frac{n_\ce{C2H6}}{n_\ce{O2}} = \frac{1}{1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly the two values are not equal. To compare it with the equivalence ratio, we need to determine the fuel–oxidizer ratio of ethane and oxygen mixture. For this we need to consider the stoichiometric reaction of ethane and oxygen,

:C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + {{frac|7|2}}&amp;nbsp;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2&amp;nbsp;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

This gives

:&lt;math chem&gt;(\text{fuel-to-oxidizer ratio based on mass})_\text{st} = \left(\frac{m_\ce{C2H6}}{m_\ce{O2}}\right)_\text{st} = \frac{1 \times (2 \times 12 + 6 \times 1)}{3.5 \times (2 \times 16)} = \frac{30}{112} = 0.268 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math chem&gt;(\text{fuel-to-oxidizer ratio based on number of moles})_\text{st} = \left(\frac{n_\ce{C2H6}}{n_\ce{O2}}\right)_\text{st} = \frac{1}{3.5} = 0.286 &lt;/math&gt;

Thus we can determine the equivalence ratio of the given mixture as

:&lt;math chem&gt; \phi = \frac{m_\ce{C2H6}/m_\ce{O2}}{\left(m_\ce{C2H6}/m_\ce{O2}\right)_\text{st}} = \frac{0.938}{0.268} = 3.5 &lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently, as

:&lt;math chem&gt; \phi = \frac{n_\ce{C2H6}/n_\ce{O2}}{\left(n_\ce{C2H6}/n_\ce{O2}\right)_\text{st}} = \frac{1}{0.286} = 3.5 &lt;/math&gt;

Another advantage of using the equivalence ratio is that ratios greater than one always mean there is more fuel in the fuel–oxidizer mixture than required for complete combustion (stoichiometric reaction), irrespective of the fuel and oxidizer being used—while ratios less than one represent a deficiency of fuel or equivalently excess oxidizer in the mixture. This is not the case if one uses fuel–oxidizer ratio, which take different values for different mixtures.

The fuel–air equivalence ratio is related to the air–fuel equivalence ratio (defined previously) as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \frac{1}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

===Mixture fraction===
The relative amounts of oxygen enrichment and fuel dilution can be quantified by the mixture fraction, Z, defined as
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \left[ \frac{s Y_\mathrm{F} - Y_\mathrm{O} + Y_\mathrm{O,0}}{s Y_\mathrm{F,0} + Y_\mathrm{O,0}} \right]&lt;/math&gt;,
where
:&lt;math&gt;s = \mathrm{AFR}_\mathrm{stoich} = \frac{W_\mathrm{O} \times v_\mathrm{O}}{W_\mathrm{F} \times v_\mathrm{F}}&lt;/math&gt;,
''Y''&lt;sub&gt;F,0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;O,0&lt;/sub&gt; represent the fuel and oxidizer mass fractions at the inlet, ''W''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and ''W''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; are the species molecular weights, and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; are the fuel and oxygen stoichiometric coefficients, respectively. The stoichiometric mixture fraction is
:&lt;math&gt;Z_\mathrm{st} = \left[ \frac{1}{1 + \frac{Y_\mathrm{F,0} \times W_\mathrm{O} \times v_\mathrm{O}}{Y_\mathrm{O,0} \times W_\mathrm{F} \times v_\mathrm{F}}} \right ]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kumfer | first =  B. | last2 = Skeen | first2 = S. | last3 = Axelbaum | first3 = R. | title = Soot inception limits in laminar diffusion flames with application to oxy-fuel combustion | journal = Combustion and Flame | year = 2008 | volume = 154 | pages = 546–556 | url = http://cccu.wustl.edu/Publications%20list/Soot%20Inception%20limits%20in%20laminar%20diffusion%20flames%20with%20application%20to%20oxyfuel%20combustion.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The stoichiometric mixture fraction is related to ''λ'' (lambda) and ''ϕ'' (phi) by the equations
:&lt;math&gt;Z_\text{st} = \frac{\lambda}{1+\lambda} = \frac{1}{1+\phi}&lt;/math&gt;,
assuming
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AFR} = \frac{Y_\mathrm{O,0}}{Y_\mathrm{F,0}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eyrie.shef.ac.uk/eee/cpe630/comfun1.html ''Introduction to Fuel and Energy: 1) MOLES, MASS, CONCENTRATION AND DEFINITIONS''], accessed 2011-05-25&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Percent excess combustion air ===
[[File:Ideal-stoichiometry.jpg|thumb|Ideal stoichiometry]]In industrial [[furnace|fired heaters]], [[power plant]] steam generators, and large [[gas turbine|gas-fired turbines]], the more common terms are percent excess combustion air and percent stoichiometric air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Energy Tips {{ndash}} Process Heating {{ndash}} Check Burner Air to Fuel Ratios | publisher = U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy | date = November 2007 | url = http://www1.eere.energy.gov/manufacturing/tech_assistance/pdfs/42110.pdf | accessdate = 29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Stoichiometric combustion and excess of air | publisher = The Engineering ToolBox | url = http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/stoichiometric-combustion-d_399.html | accessdate = 29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, excess combustion air of 15 percent means that 15 percent more than the required stoichiometric air (or 115 percent of stoichiometric air) is being used.

A combustion control point can be defined by specifying the percent excess air (or oxygen) in the [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]], or by specifying the percent oxygen in the combustion product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eckerlin |first=Herbert M. |title=The Importance of Excess Air in the Combustion Process |work=Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering 406 - Energy Conservation in Industry |publisher=North Carolina State University |url=http://www.mae.ncsu.edu/eckerlin/courses/mae406/chapter3.pdf |accessdate=29 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327143946/http://www.mae.ncsu.edu/eckerlin/courses/mae406/chapter3.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[air–fuel ratio meter]] may be used to measure the percent oxygen in the combustion gas, from which the percent excess oxygen can be calculated from stoichiometry and a [[mass balance]] for fuel combustion. For example, for propane ({{chem|C|3|H|8}}) combustion between stoichiometric and 30 percent excess air (AFR&lt;sub&gt;mass&lt;/sub&gt; between 15.58 and 20.3), the relationship between percent excess air and percent oxygen is: 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Mass\% \ O_2 \ in \ propane \ combustion \ gas} = -0.1433(\mathrm{\% \ excess \ O_2})^2 + 0.214(\mathrm{\% \ excess \ O_2}) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Volume\% \ O_2 \ in \ propane \ combustion \ gas} = -0.1208(\mathrm{\% \ excess \ O_2})^2 + 0.186(\mathrm{\% \ excess \ O_2}) &lt;/math&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=May 2013}}
'''Attitude control''' is controlling the orientation of an object with respect to an [[inertial frame of reference]] or another entity like the [[celestial sphere]], certain fields, and nearby objects, etc.

Controlling vehicle attitude requires [[sensors]] to measure vehicle orientation, [[actuators]] to apply the torques needed to re-orient the vehicle to a desired attitude, and [[algorithms]] to command the actuators based on (1) sensor measurements of the current attitude and (2) specification of a desired attitude. The integrated field that studies the combination of sensors, actuators and algorithms is called "Guidance, Navigation and Control" (GNC).

== Introduction ==
{{cleanup merge|3-axis stabilized spacecraft|date=September 2013}}

A spacecraft's attitude must typically be stabilized and controlled for a variety of reasons. It is oftentimes needed so that the spacecraft [[high-gain antenna]] may be accurately pointed to Earth for communications, so that onboard experiments may accomplish precise pointing for accurate collection and subsequent interpretation of data, so that the heating and cooling effects of sunlight and shadow may be used intelligently for thermal control, and also for guidance: short propulsive maneuvers must be executed in the right direction.

===Types of stabilization===
&lt;!-- Note that this section is the target of two redirects: [[Spin-stabilized satellite]] and [[3-axis stabilized spacecraft]]. If you change the section title or re-do the sections in this article, make sure to point these redirects to the correct place!! --&gt;
There are two principal approaches to stabilizing attitude control on spacecraft:{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
*'''{{vanchor |Spin stabilization}}''' is accomplished by setting the spacecraft spinning, using the gyroscopic action of the rotating spacecraft mass as the stabilizing mechanism. Propulsion system thrusters are fired only occasionally to make desired changes in spin rate, or in the spin-stabilized attitude. If desired, the spinning may be stopped through the use of thrusters or by [[yo-yo de-spin]]. The [[Pioneer 10]] and [[Pioneer 11]] probes in the outer solar system are examples of spin-stabilized spacecraft.
*'''{{vanchor |Three-axis stabilization}}''' is an alternative method of spacecraft attitude control in which the spacecraft is held fixed in the desired orientation without any rotation.
**One method is to use small  thrusters to continually nudge the spacecraft back and forth within a [[deadband]] of allowed attitude error. Thrusters may also be referred to as mass-expulsion control (MEC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf11-2.php|title=Basics of Space Flight Section II. Space Flight Projects|publisher=[[Nasa.gov]]|accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; systems, or [[reaction control system]]s (RCS). The space probes [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] employ this method, and have used up about three quarters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/weekly-reports/2015-01-16.html|title=Voyager Weekly Reports|publisher=Nasa.gov|accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; of their 100&amp;nbsp;kg of propellant as of July 2015. 
**Another method for achieving three-axis stabilization is to use electrically powered [[reaction wheel]]s, also called momentum wheels, which are mounted on three orthogonal axes aboard the spacecraft. They provide a means to trade [[angular momentum]] back and forth between spacecraft and wheels. To rotate the vehicle on a given axis, the reaction wheel on that axis is accelerated in the opposite direction. To rotate the vehicle back, the wheel is slowed. Excess momentum that builds up in the system due to external torques from, for example, solar photon pressure or [[gravity gradient]]s, must be occasionally removed from the system by applying controlled torque to the spacecraft to allowing the wheels to return to a desired speed under computer control. This is done during maneuvers called momentum desaturation or momentum unload maneuvers. Most spacecraft use a system of thrusters to apply the torque for desaturation maneuvers. A different approach was used by the Hubble Space Telescope, which had sensitive optics that could be contaminated by thruster exhaust, and instead used [[magnetic torquers]] for desaturation maneuvers.

There are advantages and disadvantages to both spin stabilization and three-axis stabilization. Spin-stabilized craft provide a continuous sweeping motion that is desirable for fields and particles instruments, as well as some optical scanning instruments, but they may require complicated systems to de-spin antennas or optical instruments that must be pointed at targets for science observations or communications with Earth. Three-axis controlled craft can point optical instruments and antennas without having to de-spin them, but they may have to carry out special rotating maneuvers to best utilize their fields and particle instruments. If thrusters are used for routine stabilization, optical observations such as imaging must be designed knowing that the spacecraft is always slowly rocking back and forth, and not always exactly predictably. Reaction wheels provide a much steadier spacecraft from which to make observations, but they add mass to the spacecraft, they have a limited mechanical lifetime, and they require frequent momentum desaturation maneuvers, which can perturb navigation solutions because of accelerations imparted by the use of thrusters.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Articulation===
Many spacecraft have components that require articulation. [[Voyager program|Voyager]] and [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]], for example, were designed with scan platforms for pointing optical instruments at their targets largely independently of spacecraft orientation. Many spacecraft, such as Mars orbiters, have solar panels that must track the Sun so they can provide electrical power to the spacecraft. [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini's]] main engine nozzles were steerable. Knowing where to point a solar panel, or scan platform, or a nozzle — that is, how to articulate it — requires knowledge of the spacecraft's attitude. Because AACS keeps track of the spacecraft's attitude, the Sun's location, and Earth's location, it can compute the proper direction to point the appendages. It logically falls to one subsystem, then, to manage both attitude and articulation. The name AACS may even be carried over to a spacecraft even if it has no appendages to articulate.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

== Sensors ==

===Relative attitude sensors===
Many sensors generate outputs that reflect the rate of change in attitude. These require a known initial attitude, or external information to use them to determine attitude. Many of this class of sensor have some noise, leading to inaccuracies if not corrected by absolute attitude sensors.

====Gyroscopes====
[[Gyroscope]]s are devices that sense rotation in [[three-dimensional space]] without reliance on the observation of external objects. Classically, a gyroscope consists of a spinning mass, but there are also "[[Laser ring gyroscope|ring laser gyros]]" utilizing coherent light reflected around a closed path. Another type of "gyro" is a [[Hemispherical resonator gyroscope|hemispherical resonator gyro]] where a crystal cup shaped like a wine glass can be driven into oscillation just as a wine glass "sings" as a finger is rubbed around its rim. The orientation of the oscillation is fixed in inertial space, so measuring the orientation of the oscillation relative to the spacecraft can be used to sense the motion of the spacecraft with respect to inertial space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/HRG/Documents/hrg.pdf|title=Hemispherical Resonator Gyros|publisher=Northropgrumman.com|accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Motion reference units====
Motion reference units are a kind of [[inertial measurement unit]] with single- or multi-axis motion sensors. They utilize [[Vibrating structure gyroscope#MEMS Gyroscopes|MEMS gyroscopes]]. Some multi-axis MRUs are capable of measuring [[Six degrees of freedom|roll, pitch, yaw and heave]]. They have applications outside the aeronautical field, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MRU Applications|url=http://www.km.kongsberg.com/ks/web/nokbg0240.nsf/AllWeb/2582AE354AD7FF31C1257BC5003041CA?OpenDocument|publisher=Kongsberg Maritime AS |accessdate=29 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Hydro acoustic positioning
* Motion compensation of single and [[multibeam echosounder]]s
* Ocean wave measurements
* Offshore structure motion monitoring
* Orientation and attitude measurements on [[Autonomous underwater vehicle]]s and [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s
* Ship motion monitoring

===Absolute attitude sensors===

This class of sensors sense the position or orientation of fields, objects or other phenomena outside the spacecraft.

====Horizon sensor====
A ''horizon sensor'' is an optical instrument that detects light from the 'limb' of Earth's atmosphere, i.e., at the horizon. [[Infrared#Heat|Thermal infrared]] sensing is often used, which senses the comparative warmth of the atmosphere, compared to the much colder [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic background]]. This sensor provides orientation with respect to Earth about two orthogonal axes. It tends to be less precise than sensors based on stellar observation. Sometimes referred to as an Earth sensor.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

====Orbital gyrocompass====
Similar to the way that a terrestrial [[gyrocompass]] uses a [[pendulum]] to sense local gravity and force its gyro into alignment with Earth's spin vector, and therefore point north, an ''orbital gyrocompass'' uses a horizon sensor to sense the direction to Earth's center, and a gyro to sense rotation about an axis normal to the orbit plane. Thus, the horizon sensor provides pitch and roll measurements, and the gyro provides yaw.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} See [[Tait-Bryan angles]].

====Sun sensor====
A [[sun sensor]] is a device that senses the direction to the [[Sun]]. This can be as simple as some [[solar cell]]s and shades, or as complex as a steerable [[telescope]], depending on mission requirements.

====Earth sensor====
An ''Earth sensor'' is a device that senses the direction to [[Earth]]. It is usually an [[infrared camera]]; nowadays the main method to detect attitude is the [[star tracker]], but Earth sensors are still integrated in satellites for their low cost and reliability.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

====Star tracker====
{{main|Star tracker}}
[[File:STARS on EBEX ld2012 image.png|thumb|The STARS real-time star tracking software operates on an image from [[The E and B Experiment|EBEX]] 2012, a high-altitude balloon-borne cosmology experiment launched from Antarctica on 2012-12-29]]

A ''star tracker'' is an optical device that measures the position(s) of [[star]](s) using [[photocell]](s) or a camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Star Camera|url=http://nmp.nasa.gov/st6/TECHNOLOGY/star_camera.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=25 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721054014/http://nmp.nasa.gov/st6/TECHNOLOGY/star_camera.html|archivedate=July 21, 2011|date=May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses magnitude of brightness and spectral type to identify and then calculate the relative position of stars around it.

====Magnetometer====
A ''[[magnetometer]]'' is a device that senses [[magnetic field]] strength and, when used in a three-axis triad, magnetic field direction. As a spacecraft navigational aid, sensed field strength and direction is compared to a map of [[Earth's magnetic field]] stored in the memory of an on-board or ground-based guidance computer. If spacecraft position is known then attitude can be inferred.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Algorithms==
[[Algorithms|Control algorithms]] are [[computer program]]s that receive data from vehicle sensors and derive the appropriate commands to the actuators to rotate the vehicle to the desired attitude. The algorithms range from very simple, e.g. [[proportional control]], to complex nonlinear estimators or many in-between types, depending on mission requirements. Typically, the attitude control algorithms are part of the [[Computer software|software]] running on the [[Computer hardware|hardware]], which receives commands from the ground and formats vehicle data [[telemetry]] for transmission to a ground station.

The attitude control algorithms are written and implemented based on requirement for a particular attitude maneuver. Asides the implementation of passive attitude control such as the [[gravity-gradient stabilization]], most spacecrafts make use of active control which exhibits a typical attitude control loop. The design of the control algorithm depends on the actuator to be used for the specific attitude maneuver although using a simple [[PID controller|'''proportional–integral–derivative controller''' ('''PID controller''')]] satisfies most control needs.

The appropriate commands to the actuators are obtained based on error signals described as the difference between the measured and desired attitude. The error signals are commonly measured as [[euler angles]] (Φ, θ, Ψ), however an alternative to this could be described in terms of [[direction cosine]] matrix or error [[quaternion]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. The PID controller which is most common reacts to an error signal (deviation) based on attitude as follows

&lt;math&gt;T_c (t) = K_\text{p} e(t) + K_\text{i} \int_0^t e(\tau) \,d\tau + K_\text{d} \dot{e}(t),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T_c &lt;/math&gt; is the control torque, &lt;math&gt; e&lt;/math&gt; is the attitude deviation signal, and  &lt;math&gt; K_\text{p}, K_\text{i}, K_\text{d} &lt;/math&gt; are the PID controller parameters.

A simple implementation of this can be the application of the proportional control for [[Nadir|nadir pointing]] making use of either momentum or reaction wheels as actuators. Based on the change in momentum of the wheels, the control law can be defined in 3-axes x, y, z as

&lt;math&gt;T_cx  = -K_\text{q1} q_1 + K_\text{w1} {w_x},&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_cy  = -K_\text{q2} q_2 + K_\text{w2} {w_y},&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_cz  = -K_\text{q3} q_3 + K_\text{w3} {w_z},&lt;/math&gt;

This control algorithm also affects momentum dumping.

Another important and common control algorithm involves the concept of detumbling, which is attenuating the angular momentum of the spacecraft. The need to detumble the spacecraft arises from the uncontrollable state after release from the launch vehicle. Most spacecraft in [[Low Earth orbit|low earth orbit]] (LEO) makes use of magnetic detumbling concept which utilizes the effect of the earth's magnetic field. The control algorithm is called the B-Dot controller and relies on [[Magnetic torquer|magnetic coils]] or torque rods as control actuators. The control law is based on the measurement of the rate of change of body-fixed [[magnetometer]] signals.

&lt;math&gt;m  = -K\dot{B}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m  &lt;/math&gt; is the commanded magnetic dipole moment of the magnetic torquer and &lt;math&gt;k  &lt;/math&gt; is the proportional gain and &lt;math&gt;\dot{B}  &lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change of the Earth's magnetic field.

==Actuators==
Attitude control can be obtained by several mechanisms, specifically:{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Thrusters===
{{Main|Reaction control system}}
[[Vernier thruster]]s are the most common actuators, as they may be used for station keeping as well. Thrusters must be organized as a system to provide stabilization about all three axes, and at least two thrusters are generally used in each axis to provide torque as a [[couple (mechanics)|couple]] in order to prevent imparting a [[translation (geometry)|translation]] to the vehicle. Their limitations are fuel usage, engine wear, and cycles of the control valves. The fuel efficiency of an attitude control system is determined by its [[specific impulse]] (proportional to exhaust velocity) and the smallest torque impulse it can provide (which determines how often the thrusters must fire to provide precise control). Thrusters must be fired in one direction to start rotation, and again in the opposing direction if a new orientation is to be held. Thruster systems have been used on most manned space vehicles, including [[Vostok (spacecraft)|Vostok]], [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo]], [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]], and the [[Space Shuttle]].

To minimize the fuel limitation on mission duration, auxiliary attitude control systems may be used to reduce vehicle rotation to lower levels, such as small [[ion thruster]]s that accelerate ionized gases electrically to extreme velocities, using power from solar cells.

===Spin stabilization===
{{main|Spin-stabilisation}}
The entire space vehicle itself can be spun up to stabilize the orientation of a single vehicle axis. This method is widely used to stabilize the final stage of a launch vehicle. The entire spacecraft and an attached solid rocket motor are spun up about the rocket's thrust axis, on a "spin table" oriented by the attitude control system of the lower stage on which the spin table is mounted. When final orbit is achieved, the satellite may be de-spun by various means, or left spinning. Spin stabilization of satellites is only applicable to those missions with a primary axis of orientation that need not change dramatically over the lifetime of the satellite and no need for extremely high precision pointing. It is also useful for missions with instruments that must scan the star field or Earth's surface or atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} See [[spin-stabilized satellite]].

===Momentum wheels===
{{main|Momentum wheel}}
These are [[electric motor]] driven rotors made to spin in the direction opposite to that required to re-orient the vehicle. Because momentum wheels make up a small fraction of the spacecraft's mass and are computer controlled, they give precise control. Momentum wheels are generally suspended on [[magnetic bearing]]s to avoid bearing friction and breakdown problems.{{citation needed|reason=|date=September 2015}} To maintain orientation in three dimensional space a minimum of three must be used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erps.spacegrant.org/uploads/images/images/iepc_articledownload_1988-2007/1997index/7128.pdf |title=Investigation of Pulsed Plasma Thrusters for Spacecraft Attitude Control |publisher=Erps.spacegrant.org |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; with additional units providing single failure protection. See [[Euler angles]].

===Control moment gyros===
{{main|Control moment gyroscope}}
These are rotors spun at constant speed, mounted on [[gimbal]]s to provide attitude control. Although a CMG provides control about the two axes orthogonal to the gyro spin axis, triaxial control still requires two units. A CMG is a bit more expensive in terms of cost and mass, because gimbals and their drive motors must be provided. The maximum torque (but not the maximum angular momentum change) exerted by a CMG is greater than for a momentum wheel, making it better suited to large spacecraft. A major drawback is the additional complexity, which increases the number of failure points. For this reason, the [[International Space Station]] uses a set of four CMGs to provide dual failure tolerance.

===Solar sails===
{{main|Solar sail}}
Small solar sails (devices that produce thrust as a reaction force induced by reflecting incident light) may be used to make small attitude control and velocity adjustments. This application can save large amounts of fuel on a long-duration mission by producing control moments without fuel expenditure. For example, [[Mariner 10]] adjusted its attitude using its solar cells and antennas as small solar sails.

===Gravity-gradient stabilization===
{{main|Gravity-gradient stabilization}}
In orbit, a spacecraft with one axis much longer than the other two will spontaneously orient so that its long axis points at the planet's center of mass. This system has the virtue of needing no active control system or expenditure of fuel. The effect is caused by a [[tidal force]]. The upper end of the vehicle feels less gravitational pull than the lower end. This provides a restoring torque whenever the long axis is not co-linear with the direction of gravity. Unless some means of damping is provided, the spacecraft will oscillate about the local vertical. Sometimes [[tether propulsion|tethers]] are used to connect two parts of a satellite, to increase the stabilizing torque. A problem with such tethers is that meteoroids as small as a grain of sand can part them.

===Magnetic torquers===
{{main|Magnetic torquers}}
[[Electromagnetic coil|Coils]] or (on very small satellites) [[permanent magnets]] exert a moment against the local magnetic field. This method works only where there is a magnetic field against which to react. One classic field "coil" is actually in the form of a [[Electrodynamic tether|conductive tether]] in a planetary magnetic field. Such a conductive tether can also generate electrical power, at the expense of [[orbital decay]]. Conversely, by inducing a counter-current, using solar cell power, the orbit may be raised. Due to massive variability in Earth's magnetic field from an ideal radial field, control laws based on torques coupling to this field will be highly non-linear. Moreover, only two-axis control is available at any given time meaning that a vehicle reorient may be necessary to null all rates.

===Pure passive attitude control===
There exist two main passive control types for satellites. The first one uses gravity gradient, and it leads to four stable states with the long axis (axis with smallest moment of inertia) pointing towards Earth. As this system has four stable states, if the satellite has a preferred orientation, e.g. a camera pointed at the planet, some way to flip the satellite and its tether end-for-end is needed. The other passive system orients the satellite along Earth's magnetic field thanks to a magnet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vincent.francois-l.be/OUFTI_ADCS_2010_05_31.pdf Attitude and Determination Control Systems for the OUFTI nanosatellites]. Vincent Francois-Lavet (2010-05-31)&lt;/ref&gt; These purely passive attitude control systems have limited pointing accuracy, because the spacecraft will oscillate around energy minima. This drawback is overcome by adding damper, which can be hysteretic materials or a viscous damper. The viscous damper is a small can or tank of fluid mounted in the spacecraft, possibly with internal baffles to increase internal friction. Friction within the damper will gradually convert oscillation energy into heat dissipated within the viscous damper.

[[Image:Maccari-Cicero.jpg|thumb|300px|Representation of a sitting of the Roman Senate: [[Cicero]] attacks [[Catilina]], from a 19th-century fresco]]
{{Roman government}}

'''''Auctoritas''''' is a [[Latin]] word which is the origin of English "[[authority]]". While historically its use in English was restricted to discussions of the political [[history of Rome]], the beginning of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] philosophy in the 20th century expanded the use of the word.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

In [[ancient Rome]], ''Auctoritas'' referred to the general level of prestige a person had in Roman society, and, as a consequence, his clout, influence, and ability to rally support around his will. ''Auctoritas'' was not merely political, however; it had a [[numinous]] content and symbolized the mysterious "power of command" of heroic Roman figures.

Noble women could also achieve a degree of Auctoritas. For example, the wives, sisters, and mothers of the Julio-Claudians had immense influence on society, the masses, and the political apparatus. Their Auctoritas was exercised less overtly than their male counterparts due to Roman societal norms, but they were powerful nonetheless.

==Etymology and origin==
According to French linguist [[Emile Benveniste]], ''auctor'' (which also gives us English "[[author]]") is derived from Latin ''[[Wikt:augeo|augeō]]'' ("to augment", "to enlarge", "to enrich"). The ''auctor'' is "''is qui auget''", the one who augments the act or the [[juridical]] situation of another.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Bradstreet Greenough|J. B. Greenough]] disputes this etymology of ''auctor'' - but not the sense of foundation and augmentation - in "Latin Etymologies", ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'', Vol. 4, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Auctor'' in the sense of "author", comes from ''auctor'' as founder or, one might say, "planter-cultivator". Similarly, ''auctoritas'' refers to rightful [[ownership]], based on one's having "produced" or [[homestead principle|homesteaded]] the article of property in question - more in the sense of "sponsored" or "acquired" than "manufactured". This ''auctoritas'' would, for example, persist through an ''[[usucapio]]'' of ill-gotten or abandoned property.

==Political meaning in Ancient Rome==
Politically, ''auctoritas'' was connected to the [[Roman Senate|Roman Senate's]] authority (''auctoritas patrum''), not to be confused with [[potestas]] or [[imperium]] ([[political power|power]]), which were held by the [[magistratus|magistrates]] or the [[plebs|people]]. In this context, ''Auctoritas'' could be defined as the juridical power to authorize some other act.

The 19th-century [[classicist]] [[Theodor Mommsen]] describes the "force" of ''auctoritas'' as "more than advice and less than command, an advice which one may not safely ignore." [[Cicero]] says of power and authority, ''"Cum potestas in populo auctoritas in senatu sit."'' ("While power resides in the people, authority rests with the Senate.")&lt;ref&gt;De leg. 3. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In the private domain, those under tutelage (guardianship), such as women and minors, were similarly obliged to seek the sanction of their ''tutors'' ("protectors") for certain actions. Thus, ''auctoritas'' characterizes the ''auctor'': The [[pater familias]] ''authorizes'' – that is, validates and legitimates – his son's wedding ''in prostate''. In this way, ''auctoritas'' might function as a kind of "passive counsel", much as, for example, a scholarly authority.

===Auctoritas principis===
After the fall of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], during the days of the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] had the title of [[princeps]] ("first citizen" of Rome) and held the ''auctoritas principis'' – the supreme [[moral authority]] – in conjunction with the imperium and potestas – the military, judiciary and administrative powers.

==Middle Ages==
The notion of auctoritas was often invoked by the papacy during the Middle Ages, in order to secure the [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]] of the Pope. [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] most famously invoked auctoritas in order to depose kings and emperors and to try to establish a papal [[theocracy]].

== Hannah Arendt ==&lt;!--Linked from 'Hannah Arendt'--&gt;
[[Hannah Arendt]] considered ''auctoritas'' a reference to founding acts as the source of political authority in Ancient Rome. She took foundation to include (as ''augeō'' suggests), the continuous conservation and increase of principles handed down from "the beginning" (see also [[pietas (virtue)|pietas]]). According to Arendt, this source of authority was rediscovered in the course of the 18th-century [[American Revolution]] (see "United States of America" under [[Founding Fathers]]), as an alternative to an intervening [[Western culture|Western tradition]] of [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]], claiming absolute authority, as from [[God]] (see [[Divine Right of Kings]]), and later from [[Natural law|Nature]], [[Nous|Reason]], [[Historical Materialism|History]], and even, as in the [[French Revolution]], [[Revolution]] itself (see [[Reign of Terror|La Terreur]]). Arendt views a crisis of authority as common to both the American and French Revolutions, and the response to that crisis a key factor in the relative success of the former and failure of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, On Revolution, Chapter 5, Section 2. (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

Arendt further considered the sense of ''auctor'' and ''auctoritas'' in various Latin [[idiom]]s, and the fact that ''auctor'' was used in contradistinction to – and (at least by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]) held in higher esteem than – ''artifices'', the [[artisan]]s to whom it might fall to "merely" build up or implement the author-founder's vision and design.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, Between Past and Future, Chapter 3, Section IV. (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Black Cat Analogy''' is an [[analogy]], accounting for the differences, mainly between [[science]] and [[religion]], but also between others, such as [[philosophy]] and [[metaphysics]].

==Description==
The analogy can be described like this:

*Philosophy is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat.
*Metaphysics is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat that isn't there.
*Theology is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat that isn't there, and shouting "I found it!"
*Science is like being in a dark room looking for a black cat while using a flashlight.

It can also be applied to other bodies of knowledge or learning, for example by [[Ernest Gellner]] to [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name=doniger/&gt;

==Explanation==
Vincent Barry explains the difference between philosophy and [[theology]] as lying in the fact that philosophy is scientific and open-minded, concerned with proof, while theologians "have found their final truth" before they begin the search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barry|first=Vincent|title=Bioethics in a Cultural Context|date=2011|publisher=Cengage|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ie0XO1aKVSsC&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;ots=yWfum64HEM&amp;dq=Philosophy%20is%20like%20being%20in%20a%20dark%20room%20and%20looking%20for%20a%20black%20cat.&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=Philosophy%20is%20like%20being%20in%20a%20dark%20room%20and%20looking%20for%20a%20black%20cat.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Many variations on the analogy exist, and they have been variously attributed to several famous figures at different times (e.g. [https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin#Misquoted misquotations of Charles Darwin]), but the quotation has been around since at least the 1890s.&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator 15 February 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= A Blind Man in a Dark Room Looking for a Black Cat That Is Not There |url= http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/02/15/hidden-cat/ | first= Garson| last= O’Toole| date= 15 February 2015| website= Quote Investigator | accessdate= 4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its absolute origin is unknown.&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator 19 February 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= The Philosopher, the Theologian, and the Elusive Black Cat|url= http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/02/19/philo-cat/| first= Garson| last= O’Toole| date= 19 February 2015| website= Quote Investigator | accessdate= 4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentators===
[[Wendy Doniger]] relates it to a French and English [[proverb]]: "In the dark, all cats are grey." [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] criticised naive ideas of the Absolute, which he ridiculed as "like a night, as people say, in which all cows are black." [[Dashiell Hammett]] in ''[[The Dain Curse]]'' (1929) referred to a "blind man in a dark room hunting for a black hat that wasn't there". [[Ernest Gellner]] referred to an [[East European]] joke about science, philosophy, and [[Marxism]] as looking for a cat in a dark room with various consequences: with science the cat is present, with philosophy absent, and with Marxism absent but found.&lt;ref name=doniger&gt;{{cite book|last=Doniger|first=Wendy|title=The Implied Spider|date=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=31–33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76Oh3p2vpe4C&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;ots=Ut0qmJjwux&amp;dq=Philosophy%20is%20like%20being%20in%20a%20dark%20room%20and%20looking%20for%20a%20black%20cat.&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q=Philosophy%20is%20like%20being%20in%20a%20dark%20room%20and%20looking%20for%20a%20black%20cat.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|evidence handling in U.S. criminal trials|rules in American football|Tom Brady#The Brady rule}}
{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}
'''''Brady'' disclosure''' consists of [[Exculpatory evidence|exculpatory]] or [[witness impeachment|impeaching]] information and evidence that is material to the guilt or innocence or to the punishment of a defendant. The term comes from the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Brady v. Maryland]]'',&lt;ref&gt;373 U.S. 83 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Supreme Court ruled that suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to a defendant who has requested it violates [[due process]]. 

Following ''Brady'', the prosecutor must disclose evidence or information that would prove the innocence of the defendant or would enable the defense to more effectively impeach the credibility of government witnesses. Evidence that would serve to reduce the defendant's sentence must also be disclosed by the prosecution. In practice this doctrine has often proved difficult to enforce. Some states have established their own laws to try to strengthen enforcement against prosecutorial misconduct in this area.

==Definition of the ''Brady'' rule==
The ''Brady'' doctrine is a [[pretrial discovery]] rule that was established by the United States Supreme Court in ''Brady v. Maryland'' (1963).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kaplan (law professor)|John Kaplan]], [[Robert Weisberg]], and Guyora Binder, [https://law.stanford.edu/publications/criminal-law-cases-and-materials-7th-edition/ {{smallcaps|Criminal Law - Cases and Materials}}] 4 (Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business, 7th ed. 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The rule requires that the prosecution must turn over all exculpatory evidence to the [[defendant]] in a [[criminal case]]. Exculpatory [[evidence]] is evidence that might exonerate the defendant.

==Examples==
Examples include the following:
* The prosecutor must disclose an agreement not to prosecute a witness in exchange for the witness's testimony.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Giglio v. United States]]'', 405 U.S. 150 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The prosecutor must disclose leniency (or preferential treatment) agreements made with witnesses in exchange for testimony.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. v. Sudikoff'', 36 F.Supp. 2d 1196 (C.D. Cal. 1999); ''State v. Lindsey'', 621 So. 2d 618 (La. Ct. App. 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The prosecutor must disclose [[exculpatory evidence]] known only to the police. That is, the prosecutor has a duty to reach out to the police and establish regular procedures by which the police inform the prosecutor's office of anything that tends to prove the innocence of the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;''Kyles v. Whitley'', 514 U.S. 419 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Not all exculpatory evidence is required to be disclosed by Brady and its progeny; only evidence that is "material to guilt or punishment" must be disclosed because its disclosure would create a reasonable probability of changing the outcome of the proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Strickler v. Greene]]'', 527 U.S. 263, 281-82 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor is not obligated to ''personally'' review police files in search of exculpatory information when the defendant asks for it, but to allow the defense reasonable access.&lt;ref&gt;''U.S. v. Herring'', 83 F.3d 1120 (9th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court observed in ''[[Strickler v. Greene]]'', "Thus the term 'Brady violation' is sometimes used to refer to any breach of the broad obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence – that is, to any suppression of so-called 'Brady material' – although strictly speaking, there is never a real 'Brady violation' unless the nondisclosure was so serious that there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict."&lt;ref&gt;Strickler, 527 U.S. at 281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonner, "The Inquisition by Special Prosecutor in United States v. Senator Ted Stevens: of Brady, Contempt, and the Forensic Trifecta", Vol. 51, No. 1 ''Criminal Law Bulletin'' 69-125 (Thompson Reuters 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The prosecutor must disclose arrest photographs of the defendant when those photos do not match the victim's description.&lt;ref&gt;''Commonwealth v. Tucceri'', 412 Mass. 401 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some state systems have expansively defined Brady material to include many other items, including for example any documents which might reflect negatively on a witness's credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, Laural L.; Marsh, Jennifer E.; and Yeh, Brian. [http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/BradyMat.pdf/$file/BradyMat.pdf ''Treatment of Brady v. Maryland Material in United States District and State Courts’ Rules, Orders, and Policies: Report to the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules of the Judicial Conference of the United States''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331200457/http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/bradymat.pdf/$file/bradymat.pdf# |date=2010-03-31 }}, [[Federal Judicial Center]], October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Police officers who have been dishonest are sometimes referred to as "Brady cops." Because of the Brady ruling, prosecutors are required to notify defendants and their attorneys whenever a law enforcement official involved in their case has a sustained record for knowingly lying in an official capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lewis |last=Kamb |authorlink= |last2=Nalder |first2=Eric |title=Cops who lie don't always lose jobs |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/349169_lying29.html |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |publisher= |date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The growing use of Brady, both in the federal and state sectors with somewhat [[ephemerality|evanescent and mercurial]] standards, is one of the most important changes affecting police officers' employment.&lt;ref name="Archison"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.lris.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ROP7-The-Brady-Rule.pdf |first1=Will |last1=Atchison |chapter=Chapter 6: The Brady Rule |title=The Rights of Law Enforcement Officers |edition=7th |format=PDF |publisher=Labor Relations Information System, www.LRIS.com |location=Portland, Oregon |date=July 2015 |isbn=978-1880607299 |ID=ISBN 1880607298 |accessdate=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedures for compliance==
* In order to ensure compliance with ''Brady'', the United States Supreme Court repeatedly urged the "careful prosecutor" to favor disclosure over concealment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kyles v. Whitley]]'', 514 U.S. 419, 440; ''[[United States. v. Agurs]]'', 427 U.S. 97, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Conformity with ''Brady'' is a continuing obligation of prosecutors.  Some prosecuting attorney offices have adopted and created specialized procedure and bureaus to meet their burden.&lt;ref name="LA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://da.co.la.ca.us/sd02-08.htm |title=Special Directive 02-08 Brady Protocol |date=December 7, 2002 |publisher=[[Los Angeles County District Attorney]] |accessdate=April 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408213135/http://da.co.la.ca.us/sd02-08.htm |archivedate=April 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Pitchess v. Superior Court''&lt;ref&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15520905555230302925&amp;hl=en Pitchess v. Superior Court]'', 11 Cal.3d 531 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; is the source for a "[[Pitchess motion]]". Such a motion can be made by a criminal defendant to discover complaints made against a police officer, and the investigation of those complaints, such that they are contained in the officer’s personnel records. The motions can be made in a [[California Superior Court]] under California Evidence Code 1043-1046.&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Evid. Code §§ [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=evid&amp;group=01001-02000&amp;file=1040-1047 1043-1046] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408212529/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=evid&amp;group=01001-02000&amp;file=1040-1047# |date=2014-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding the broad nature of the discovery that the associated court rule and statute provide, getting actual records is problematic. In California, there is a carefully prescribed procedure governing such request, and making disclosure without an order is a crime.  The statutory scheme was developed, in part, because law enforcement departments had developed a practice of purging their files concerning misconduct claims made against their officers.&lt;ref name="Steering"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brady List and Pitchess Motions |first1=Jerry L. |last1=Steering |url=http://steeringlaw.com/brady-list-pitchess-motion/ |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''This article refers to the use of computers to estimate losses caused by disasters.  For other meanings of the word catastrophe, including [[catastrophe theory]] in mathematics, see [[catastrophe (disambiguation)]].''

'''Catastrophe modeling''' &lt;ref&gt;See: Mitchell-Wallace, K. Jones, M., Hillier, J. K., Foote, M. (2017) Natural catastrophe risk management and modelling: A practitioner’s guide. Wiley {{ISBN|978-1118906040}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as '''cat modeling''') is the process of using [[computer]]-assisted calculations to estimate the losses that could be sustained due to a catastrophic event such as a hurricane or earthquake. Cat modeling is especially applicable to analyzing risks in the [[insurance]] industry and is at the confluence of [[actuarial science]], [[engineering]], [[meteorology]], and [[seismology]].

== Perils analyzed ==
Natural catastrophes (sometimes referred to as "nat cat") include: 
* [[hurricane]] (main peril is wind damage; some models can also include storm surge)
* [[earthquake]] (main peril is ground shaking; some models can also include [[tsunami]], fire following earthquakes, and sprinkler leakage damage)
* severe [[thunderstorm]] (main perils are [[tornado]] and [[hail]])
* [[flood]]
* [[extratropical cyclone]]
* [[wildfire]]
* [[winter storm]]
Human catastrophes include: 
* [[terrorism]] events
* [[war]]fare
* Casualty/liability events
* Displacement Crises&lt;ref&gt;See: Edwards, Scott. ''The Chaos of Forced Migration: A Means of Modeling Complexity for Humanitarian Ends''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lines of business modeled ==
* Personal property
* Commercial property
* Workers' compensation
* Automobile physical damage
* Limited liabilities
* Product liability
* Business Interruption

== Input ==
The input into a typical cat modeling software package is information on the exposures being analyzed that are vulnerable to catastrophe risk.  The exposure data can be categorized into three basic groups:

* information on the site locations, referred to as geocoding data (street address, postal code, county/CRESTA zone, et cetera)
* information on the physical characteristics of the exposures (construction, occupation/occupancy, year built, number of stories, number of employees, et cetera)
* information on the financial terms of the insurance coverage (coverage value, limit, deductible, et cetera)

== Output ==
The output is an estimate of the losses that the model predicts would be associated with a particular event or set of events.  When running a [[Mathematical model#Model classifications in mathematics|''probabilistic'' model]], the output is either a probabilistic loss distribution or a set of events that could be used to create a loss distribution; probable maximum losses (PMLs) and average annual losses (AALs) are calculated from the loss distribution.  When running a ''deterministic'' model, losses caused by a specific event are calculated; for example, [[Hurricane Katrina]] or "a magnitude 8.0 earthquake in downtown San Francisco" could be analyzed against the portfolio of exposures.

== Uses ==
* Insurers and risk managers use cat modeling to assess the risk in a portfolio of exposures.  This might help guide an insurer's underwriting strategy or help them decide how much [[reinsurance]] to purchase.
* Some state departments of insurance allow insurers to use cat modeling in their rate filings to help determine how much premium their policyholders are charged in catastrophe-prone areas.
* Insurance rating agencies such as [[A. M. Best]] and [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] use cat modeling to assess the financial strength of insurers that take on catastrophe risk.
* Reinsurers and reinsurance brokers use cat modeling in the pricing and structuring of reinsurance treaties.
* European insurers use cat models to derive the required regulatory capital under the Solvency II regime. Cat models are used to derive catastrophe loss probability distributions which are components of many Solvency II internal capital models.
* Likewise, cat bond investors, investment banks, and bond rating agencies use cat modeling in the pricing and structuring of  [[catastrophe bond]].

== Open catastrophe modeling ==
Recently, an effort to create and disseminate open multi-hazard cat risk modeling tools was initiated by the [http://www.risk-agora.org/ Alliance for Global Open Risk Analysis (AGORA)].

Also, Oasis Loss Modelling Framework (LMF) http://www.oasislmf.org has been created. It has been founded as a not for profit organisation funded and owned by the Insurance Industry to promote open access to models and to promote transparency. Open source code for the framework is available at http://github.com/oasislmf .

Additionally, the insurance industry is currently working with the [http://www.acord.org/ Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development (ACORD)] to develop an industry standard for collecting and sharing exposure data.  To date, the industry has been operating on closed, proprietary data formats.

In [[political theory]] and particularly [[Marxism]], '''class consciousness''' is the set of beliefs that a person holds regarding their [[social class]] or economic rank in society, the structure of their class, and their class interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wright, Erik Olin|chapter=Class|editors=Beckert, Jens &amp; Zafirovski, Milan|title=International encyclopedia of economic sociology|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-28673-2|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9yEAm0yVaQC&amp;pg=PA62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borland-2008-p134" /&gt; It is an awareness that is key to sparking a revolution that would, "create a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], transforming it from a wage-earning, property-less mass into the ruling class" according to [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sociological Theory in the Classical Era|last = Appelrouth|first = Scott|publisher = SAGE|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-4129-7564-3|location = United States of America|pages = 26|last2 = Desfor Edles|first2 = Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxist theory==
While German theorist [[Karl Marx]] rarely used the term "class consciousness", he did make the distinction between "class in itself", which is defined as a category of people having a common relation to the [[means of production]], and a "class for itself", which is defined as a stratum [[collective action|organized in active pursuit]] of its own interests.&lt;ref name="Borland-2008-p134"&gt;{{cite book |author=Borland, Elizabeth|chapter=Class consciousness|editor=Parrillo, Vincent N.|title=Encyclopedia of social problems, Volume 1|publisher=SAGE|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4129-4165-5|page=134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mRGr_B4Y1CEC&amp;pg=PT134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defining a person's social class can be a determinant for their awareness of it. Marxists define classes on the basis of their relation to the means of production &amp;ndash; especially on whether they own [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Non-Marxist social scientists distinguish various [[Social stratification|social strata]] on the basis of income, occupation, or status.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Elster, ''An Introduction to Karl Marx''. Cambridge, England, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the nineteenth century, the labels "[[working class]]es" and "[[middle class]]es" were already coming into common usage. "The old hereditary aristocracy, reinforced by the new gentry who owed their success to commerce, industry, and the professions, evolved into an "[[upper class]]". Its consciousness was formed in part by public schools (in the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|British sense]] where it refers to a form of private school) and Universities. The upper class tenaciously maintained control over the political system, depriving not only the working classes but the middle classes of a voice in the political process."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/history/Class.html.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Georg Lukács' ''History and Class Consciousness'' (1923) ==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
Class [[consciousness]], as described by [[Georg Lukács]]'s famous ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923), is opposed to any [[psychology|psychological]] conception of consciousness, which forms the basis of individual or mass psychology (see [[Freud]] or, before him, [[Gustave Le Bon]]). According to Lukács, each social class has a determined class consciousness which it can achieve. In effect, as opposed to the [[liberalism|liberal]] conception of consciousness as the basis of [[individualism|individual freedom]] and of the [[social contract]], Marxist class consciousness is not an origin, but an achievement (i.e. it must be "earned" or won). Hence, it is never assured: the [[proletariat]]'s class consciousness is the result of a permanent struggle to understand the "[[concrete (philosophy)|concrete]] [[Universality (philosophy)|totality]]" of the [[philosophy of history|historical process]].

According to Lukács, the proletariat was the first class in history that may achieve true class consciousness, because of its specific position highlighted in the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' as the "living negation" of [[capitalism]]. All others classes, including the [[bourgeoisie]], are limited to a "[[false consciousness]]" which impedes them from understanding the totality of history: instead of understanding each specific moment as a portion of a supposedly deterministic historical process, they [[universality (philosophy)|universalize]] it and believe it is everlasting. Hence, capitalism is not thought as a specific phase of history, but is naturalized and thought of as an eternal solidified part of history. Says Lukács, this "false consciousness", which forms [[ideology]] itself, is not a simple [[error]] as in classical philosophy, but an [[illusion]] which cannot be dispelled.

[[Marx]] described it in his theory of [[commodity fetishism]], which Lukács completed with his concept of [[reification (Marxism)|reification]]: [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]] is what follows the worker's estrangement to the world following the new life acquired by the product of his work. The dominant bourgeois ideology thus leads the individual to see the achievement of his [[labour (economics)|labour]] take a life of its own. Furthermore, [[Division of labour|specialization]] is also seen as a characteristic of the ideology of modern [[rationalism]], which creates specific and independent domains (art, politics, science, etc.). Only a global perspective can point out how all these different domains interact, argues Lukács. He also points out how [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] brought to its limit the classical opposition between the abstract form and the concrete, historical content, which is abstractly conceived as irrational and [[contingent]]. Thus, with Kant's rational system, history becomes totally contingent and is thus ignored. Only with [[Hegel]]'s [[dialectic]] can a mediation be found between the abstract form and the abstract notion of a concrete content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lukacs/works/history/lukacs3.htm Georg Lukács, ''History and Class Consciousness'' Complete Text.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if the bourgeois loses his individual point of view in an attempt to grasp the reality of the totality of society and of the historical process, he is condemned to a form of false consciousness. As an individual, he will always see the collective result of individual actions as a form of "[[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] [[law (principle)|law]]" to which he must submit himself (liberalism has gone so far as seeing an [[invisible hand]] in this collective results, making capitalism the best of all possible worlds). By contrast, the proletariat would be, according to Lukács, the first class in history with the possibility to achieve a true form of class consciousness, granting it [[knowledge]] of the totality of the historical process.

The proletariat takes the place of Hegel's ''[[Weltgeist]]'' ("World Spirit"), which achieves history through ''[[Volksgeist]]'' ("the spirit of the people"): the [[idealist]] conception of an abstract Spirit making history, which ends in the realm of Reason, is replaced by a [[materialism|materialist]] conception based not on [[Mythology|mythical]] Spirits, but on a concrete "identical [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]-object of history": the proletariat. The proletariat is both the "object" of history, created by the capitalist social formation; but it is also the "subject" of history, as it is its labour that shapes the world, and thus, knowledge of itself is also, necessarily, knowledge of the reality and of the totality of the historical process. The proletariat's class consciousness is not immediate; class consciousness must not be mistaken either with the consciousness of one's future and collective interests, opposed to personal immediate interests.

The possibility of class consciousness is given by the objective process of history, which transforms the proletariat into a [[commodity]], hence objectifying it. Class consciousness is thus not a simple subjective act: "as consciousness here is not the consciousness of an object opposed to itself, but the object's consciousness, the act of being conscious of oneself disrupts the objectivity form of its object" (in "Reification and the Proletariat's Consciousness" §3, III "The proletariat's point of view"). In other words, instead of the bourgeois subject and its corresponding ideological concept of individual [[free will]], the proletariat has been transformed into an object (a commodity) which, when it takes consciousness of itself, transforms the very structure of objectivity, that is of reality.

This specific role of the proletariat is a consequence of its specific position; thus, for the first time, consciousness of itself (class consciousness) is also consciousness of the totality (knowledge of the entire social and historical process). Through [[dialectical materialism]], the proletariat understands that what the individual bourgeois conceived as "laws" akin to the [[physical law|laws of nature]], which may be only manipulated, as in [[Descartes]]'s dream, but not changed, is in fact the result of a social and historical process, which can be controlled. Furthermore, only dialectical materialism links together all specialized domains, which modern rationalism can only think as separate instead of as forming a totality.

Only the proletariat can understand that the so-called "eternal laws of economics" are in fact nothing more than the historical form taken by the social and economical process in a capitalist society. Since these "laws" are the result of the collective actions of individuals, and are thus created by society, Marx and Lukács reasoned that this necessarily meant that they could be ''changed''. Any attempt in transforming the so-called "laws" governing capitalism into universal principles, valid in all times and places, are criticized by Lukács as a form of false consciousness.

As the "expression of the revolutionary process itself", dialectical materialism, which is the only theory with an understanding of the totality of the historical process, is the theory which may help the proletariat in its "struggle for class consciousness". Although Lukács does not contest the Marxist primacy of the economic [[base and superstructure|base]] on the ideological [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] (not to be mistaken with vulgar [[economic determinism]]), he considers that there is a place for autonomous struggle for class consciousness.

In order to achieve a unity of [[theory]] and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]], theory must not only tend toward reality in an attempt to change it; reality must also tend towards theory. Otherwise, the historical process leads a life of its own, while theorists make their own little theories, desperately waiting for some kind of possible influence over the historical process. Henceforth, reality itself must tend toward the theory, making it the "expression of the revolutionary process itself". In turn, a theory which has as its goal helping the proletariat achieve class consciousness must first be an "objective theory of class consciousness". However, theory in itself is insufficient, and ultimately relies on the struggle of humankind and of the proletariat for consciousness: the "objective theory of class consciousness is only the theory of its objective possibility".

==Criticism==

Economist [[Ludwig Von Mises]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig von Mises]] ([1957], 2007). Theory and History: An Interpretation of Social and Economic Evolution. Auburn, Alabama: [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], p. 113. {{ISBN|978-1-933550-19-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that "Marx confus[ed] the notions of caste and class". Mises allowed that class consciousness, and the associated class struggle, were valid concepts in some circumstances where rigid social [[caste]]s exist; e.g., when [[slavery]] is legal, and slaves thus share a common motive for ending their disadvantaged status relative to other castes. "But no such conflicts are present in a society in which all citizens are equal before the law," according to Mises. "No logical objection can be advanced against distinguishing various classes among the members of such a society. Any classification is logically permissible, however arbitrarily the mark of distinction may be chosen. But it is nonsensical to classify the members of a capitalistic society according to their position in the framework of the social division of labor and then to identify these classes with the castes of a status society."

Philosopher [[Leszek Kołakowski]] argued that the "theory of class consciousness is false"&lt;ref&gt;Leszek Kolakowski, “My Correct Views on Everything,” The Socialist Register 1974, pp. 1–20&lt;/ref&gt; and that attempts by Marxist–Leninists to advance the concept of class consciousness necessarily led to totalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;’Marxism, being a scientific theory, could not be a spontaneous product of the working class [according to Lenin], but had to be imported from outside, by intellectuals equipped with scientific knowledge, became the peculiar ideological instrument to justify a new idea of the party of manipulators. Since the working class is in principle incapable of articulating theoretically its consciousness, it is possible and even necessary that the "genuine" theoretical consciousness of the working class should be incarnated in a political organism that could consider itself the carrier of this consciousness regardless of what the "empirical" working class thought about it, given that the "empirical" consciousness of this class is irrelevant in defining who in a given moment represents its interest. This is why the theory of class consciousness instilled from outside and the whole idea of scientific socialism so conceived served to justify the fact that in all kinds of political activity and later in the exercise of political power, the working class may be and must be replaced by the political apparatus which is the vehicle of its consciousness at the highest level. The whole Leninist and then Stalinist principle of dictatorship which the proletariat exercises through the intermediary of its self-appointed representatives, is only a development of the idea of "scientific socialism" so conceived.’ Leszek Kolakowski, “Althusser’s Marx” The Socialist Register 1971, pp. 111–128&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Ernest van den Haag]] has argued:
 {{cquote|One way is to say that "objectively" people have common class interests and should act according to the class struggle pattern — but that they are not always "class conscious". They suffer from "false consciousness". But this is (a) not true; nor would it (b) help much if it were.

a) There often are conflicts among objective economic interests within a Marxian class — e.g. among workers. Conflicts occur over migration, international trade, religion or race. And workers often have objective interests in common with capitalists and in conflict with the interests of other groups of workers. Class membership is no more and possibly less decisive than say race membership in determining one's political views. If you insist on the importance of race, you may persuade people to act according to their "racial interests" for a while — as the Nazis did. If you convince people that they should act according to what you tell them are your class interests, they might. The prophecy becomes self-fulfilling. But the action comes from race or class propaganda — not from race or class as objective facts.

b) Further if we assume that classes are as important as Marx thought but that people do not act accordingly, because not having read Marx, they are not class conscious – if "class consciousness" becomes independent of class membership — and if class membership is neither sufficient nor necessary to bring the expected class behaviour, then social classes become one of many groups that influence man's action on some occasions. This would be a correct theory. But the distinctive point of Marxian theory is that class membership is decisive in determining most and particularly political actions. This is patently wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Haag, Ernest van den (1987) [http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/12/rp_12_3.pdf "Marxism as pseudo-science"], ''Reason Papers'' No. 12, Spring 1987&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Indeed, it has been argued that the class interests of any class must be empirically determined by examining their actual behavior - they do not have objectively existing interests. People must assume social identities as members of a class before it becomes possible to identify what those interests are by examining their behavior and positions. It has been observed, for example, that workers form attachment to the capitalist system (through trade unions) rather than antagonism.&lt;ref&gt;John Scott, Gordon Marshall (2009).

'''Conservation of Resources (COR) Theory'''  is a [[Psychological stress|stress]] theory that describes the motivation that drives humans to both maintain their current resources and to pursue new resources. &lt;ref name="Conservation of Resources. A new attempt at conceptualizing stress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobfoll|first1=Stevan|title=Conservation of Resources. A New attempt at conceptualizing stress|journal=The American Psychologist|date=1989|volume=44|issue=3|pages=513–524}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was proposed by Dr. Stevan E. Hobfoll in 1989 as a way to expand on the literature of stress as a [[construct (philosophy of science)|construct]].&lt;ref name="Conservation of Resources. A new attempt at conceptualizing stress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobfoll|first1=Stevan|title=Conservation of Resources. A New attempt at conceptualizing stress|journal=The American Psychologist|date=1989|volume=44|issue=3|pages=513–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Hobfoll posited that [[psychological stress]] occurred in three instances; when there was a threat of a loss of resources, an actual net loss of resources, and a lack of gained resources following the spending of resources. From this perspective, resources are defined as things that one values, specifically objects, states, and conditions. &lt;ref name='Getting to the "COR"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halbesleben|first1=J.B.|last2=Paustian-Underdal|first2=S.C.|last3=Westman|first3=M|title=Getting to the "COR": Understanding the Role of Resources in Conservation of Resources Theory|journal=Journal of Management|date=2014|volume=40|issue=5|pages=1334–1364|doi=10.1177/0149206314527130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''COR''' states that loss of these types of resources will drive individuals into certain levels of stress. &lt;ref name="Conservation of Resources. A new attempt at conceptualizing stress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobfoll|first1=Stevan|title=Conservation of Resources. A New attempt at conceptualizing stress|journal=The American Psychologist|date=1989|volume=44|issue=3|pages=513–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of stress theory ==

'''COR''' was developed from various theories on the cause of stress.  '''COR''' development branches back to [[Walter Bradford Cannon]] (1932) who was one of the first researchers to study the concept of stress as it applies to humans, specifically in how stress can be withstood. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cannon|first1=Walter|title=The wisdom of the body|date=1932|publisher=W W Norton &amp; Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hans Selye]] (1950) took on Cannon’s research on stress as a response and indicated that stress itself was designed as a way to protect the body from environmental challenges. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Selye|first1=Hans|title=The physiology and pathology of exposure to stress|date=1950|publisher=Acta|location=Monteral}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conservation of Resources. A new attempt at conceptualizing stress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobfoll|first1=Stevan|title=Conservation of Resources. A New attempt at conceptualizing stress|journal=The American Psychologist|date=1989|volume=44|issue=3|pages=513–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Other researchers such as Elliot and Eisdorfer (1982) defined stress as specifically being the stimulus and not the response, which had been accepted by some of the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elliott|first1=GR|last2=Eisdorfer|first2=C|title=Stress and human health|date=1982|publisher=Springer|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this theory is largely based on the homeostatic model of stress developed by Joseph McGrath (1970). &lt;ref name="autogenerated1970"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGrath|first1=Joseph|title=A conceptual formulation for research on stress|journal=Social and Psychological Factors in Stress|date=1970|volume=10|issue=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is in this theory that stress is defined as an imbalance between the environmental demand and the response capability of an organism. &lt;ref name="autogenerated1970"/&gt;

== Basic principles of COR ==

COR covers two basic principles involving the protection of resources from being lost. &lt;ref name="Conservation of Resources. A new attempt at conceptualizing stress"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobfoll|first1=Stevan|title=Conservation of Resources. A New attempt at conceptualizing stress|journal=The American Psychologist|date=1989|volume=44|issue=3|pages=513–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Getting to the "COR"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halbesleben|first1=J.B.|last2=Paustian-Underdal|first2=S.C.|last3=Westman|first3=M|title=Getting to the "COR": Understanding the Role of Resources in Conservation of Resources Theory|journal=Journal of Management|date=2014|volume=40|issue=5|pages=1334–1364|doi=10.1177/0149206314527130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first principle is called the '''Primacy of Resource Loss.'''&lt;ref name='Getting to the "COR"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halbesleben|first1=J.B.|last2=Paustian-Underdal|first2=S.C.|last3=Westman|first3=M|title=Getting to the "COR": Understanding the Role of Resources in Conservation of Resources Theory|journal=Journal of Management|date=2014|volume=40|issue=5|pages=1334–1364|doi=10.1177/0149206314527130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This principles states that it is more harmful for individuals to lose resources compared to when there is a gain of resources.&lt;ref name='Getting to the "COR"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halbesleben|first1=J.B.|last2=Paustian-Underdal|first2=S.C.|last3=Westman|first3=M|title=Getting to the "COR": Understanding the Role of Resources in Conservation of Resources Theory|journal=Journal of Management|date=2014|volume=40|issue=5|pages=1334–1364|doi=10.1177/0149206314527130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What this means, is that a loss of pay will be more harmful than the same gain in pay would have been helpful.    

The second principle is known as '''Resource Investment.''' &lt;ref name='Getting to the "COR"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halbesleben|first1=J.B.|last2=Paustian-Underdal|first2=S.C.|last3=Westman|first3=M|title=Getting to the "COR": Understanding the Role of Resources in Conservation of Resources Theory|journal=Journal of Management|date=2014|volume=40|issue=5|pages=1334–1364|doi=10.1177/0149206314527130}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle of '''COR''' states that people will tend to invest resources in order to protect against resource loss, to recover from losses, and to gain resources.&lt;ref name='Getting to the "COR"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halbesleben|first1=J.B.|last2=Paustian-Underdal|first2=S.C.|last3=Westman|first3=M|title=Getting to the "COR": Understanding the Role of Resources in Conservation of Resources Theory|journal=Journal of Management|date=2014|volume=40|issue=5|pages=1334–1364|doi=10.1177/0149206314527130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of coping, people will invest resources to prevent future resource losses.  

From these two principles, '''COR''' has suggested a number of corollaries that can be applied to resource changes. &lt;ref name="Conservation of Resources.

== Areas of research ==

'''COR''' has been utilized when studying work/family stress,&lt;ref name="The Conservation of Resources Model applied to work-family conflict and strain"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grandey|first1=A|last2=Cropanzano|first2=R|title=The Conservation of Resources model applied to work-family conflict and strain|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|date=1999|volume=54|issue=2|pages=350–370|doi=10.1006/jvbe.1998.1666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A conservation of  resources view of the relationship between work engagement and work interference with family"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halbesleben|first1=J.R.|last2=Harvey|first2=J.|last3=Bolino|first3=M.C.|title=A conservation of  resources view of the relationship between work engagement and work interference with family|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2009|volume=94|issue=6|page=1452}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Occupational burnout|burnout]],&lt;ref name="Sources of social support and burnout"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halbesleben|first1=J.R.|title=Sources of support and burnout: a meta analytic test of the conservation of resources model|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2006|volume=91|issue=5|page=1134}}&lt;/ref&gt; and general stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobfoll|first1=Stevan|title=Conservation of resources theory: Its implication for stress, health, and resilience|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Stress, Health, and Coping|pages=127–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In work/family stress, '''COR''' research has looked at how the distribution of one’s resources have affected their home life, with some articles finding that putting too much of one’s resources into one’s work may lead to family problems at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gandey|first1=Alicia|last2=Cropanzano|first2=Russell|title=The conservation of resources model applied to work-family conflict and strain|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|date=1999|volume=54|issue=2|pages=350–370}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research into '''COR''' and burnout has examined how the use of resources has impacted one’s mood, with recent research finding that emotional exhaustion had the strongest relationship with depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neveu|first1=Jean-Pierre|title=Jailed resources: Conservation of resources theory as applied to burnout among prison guards|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|date=2007|volume=28|issue=1|pages=21–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In regards to general stress, research has explored how the loss of resources impacts the levels of one’s stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hobfoll|first1=Stevan|title=The Influence of culture, community, and the nested-self in the stress process: Advancing conservation of resources theory|journal=Applied Psychology|date=2001|volume=50|issue=2|pages=337–421}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be noted that COR has primarily been studied within the burnout and job fields, as the following meta-analyses will demonstrate.  There is currently no meta-analyses on COR within other areas of stress research.  

Multiple meta-analyses have been conducted with COR, specifically related to burnout. One meta-analyses by Lee and Ashforth (1996) examined the relationship between demand and resource correlates, behavioral and attitudinal correlate, and 3 different dimensions of job burnout. &lt;ref name="autogenerated123"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=R.T.|last2=Ashforth|first2=B.E.|title=A meta-analytic examination of the correlates of the three dimensions of job burnout|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1996|volume=81|issue=2|pages=123–133|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.81.2.123}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It used COR as the basis for this research and found that the primacy of resource loss principle is supported.  It found that, over 58 sources, individuals tend to be sensitive to increased demands rather than resources received.  &lt;ref name="autogenerated123"/&gt;   

Job control and COR have been studied through a meta-analyses conducted by Park, Baiden, Jacob, &amp; Wagner (2009). &lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=Hyung|last2=Baiden|first2=Mavis|last3=Jacob|first3=Annalyn C.|last4=Wagner|first4=Stephen H.|title=Job Control and Burnout: A Meta-Analytic Test of the Conservation of Resources Model|journal=Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings|date=2009|volume=1|pages=1–6|doi=10.5465/AMBPP.2009.44244567}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study tested COR using all constructs involved in job control and burnout which included constructs of autonomy, authority, skill discretion, and decision latitude. &lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Results indicate that the construct of job control, or the ability that one has to choose their actions from multiple options at their job, is related to depersonalization and personal accomplishment.  This study stated that COR is related to burnout in this way, but further studies should be conducted that use non-human service occupations.  &lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14036">'''Development-supported agriculture 
is a nascent movement in real estate development that preserves and invests in agricultural land use.  As farmland is lost due to the challenging economics of farming and the pressures of the real estate industry, DSA attempts to reconcile the need for development with the need to preserve agricultural land. The overall goal of DSA is to incubate small-scale organic farms that co-exist with residential land development, providing benefits to farmers, residents, the local community, and the environment.

A related term, ''agricultural urbanism'', refers to agricultural operations located in proximity to and integrated with urban areas.  The term of agricultural urbanism was coined by Mark Holland and Janine de la Salle, and is based on their book by the same name, published by Green Frigate Press in 2010 (De la Salle and Holland et al.).  The term and concept of Agricultural Urbanism was originally developed in British Columbia in 2008 during a planning process for a development project called Southlands in South Delta, Metro Vancouver and was introduced to planner, real estate developer, and founder of the New Urbanism movement, Andres Duany, as part of the preparation for a design charrette which Duany and his team were involved in. 

Two academics who authored a chapter (Patrick Condon from UBC and Kent Mulnix from Kwantlen Polytechnic) posited the original idea of using development to support agriculture by using mechanisms such as transferring density rights from agricultural land onto adjacent areas and preserving the agricultural land through covenants while harvesting the development land value in the adjacent area that received the transferred development rights. 

Andres Duany has been a significant proponent of the idea as well as the author of a similar stream of thought called Agrarain Urbanism.  Duany’s adoption of the concept has given it a higher profile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hawley|first=Steve|title=Agricultural Urbanism:Transects and Food Planning|url=http://www.houstontomorrow.org/initiatives/story/agricultural-urbanism/|publisher=HoustonTomorrow|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The term ''development-supported agriculture'' (DSA) was coined to describe the Harvest project. A variety of individuals collaborated on the project, including planner Duane Verner, developer Nathan Wieler, members of Piedmont Biofuels, participants in the Sustainable Agriculture program at Central Carolina Community College, and others. The group set out to determine the best usage for an existing farm that was being sold by the owner, a career farmer named Paul McCoy. It became clear that the group had an opportunity to create a unique residential community where farmers and residents have a symbiotic relationship. This relationship would benefit all involved, while also improving the general state of residential development and helping to reduce the ecological destruction associated with typical residential development models. Reynolds &amp; Jewell Landscape Architecture was retained to design the master plan for the community, and the team grew to include experienced organic farmers, experts on native plants, and others. As of July 2008, the developer is actively implementing the master plan, and response to the concept has been overwhelmingly positive.

==DSA and CSA==

Development-supported agriculture has its roots in the [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA) movement. However, whereas CSA typically focuses on establishing a direct business relationship between consumers and farmers, DSA builds on a [[barter]] approach first and foremost, while also ensuring that products from DSA farms are integrated into the local economy. On a more general level, DSA is a response to concerns about the urbanization of agricultural land and an attempt to preserve existing farms. Another goal of DSA is to establish a new generation of farmers by using the revenue from real estate development to establish small-scale organic farms that are protected in perpetuity by conservation easements and property covenants.

== Five points of DSA ==

Development-supported agriculture is based on the concept of a master-planned residential development with farming as the central amenity. This model provides residents with the benefits of, and the opportunity to experience, small-scale organic farming. Property owners have the option of participating in the farming or leasing their land to a farmer; in either case, the farmland is protected from development. Homesites are restricted to certain areas and continuous areas of open space are maintained across multiple properties.

In the spirit of [[Le Corbusier| Le Corbusier's]] "Five Points of a New Architecture," DSA focuses on five core principles:

# Preservation of farmland through limited development and continuity of previous farming uses.
# Agreements between developers and farmers (development provides farm infrastructure, farmers provide farm products to residents and the local community).
# Low-impact development techniques, sustainable architecture, and careful ecological/environmental planning.
# Establishment of wildlife corridors and animal habitats, promotion of native plant species, and protection of water quality.
# Utilization of an open-source development model that provides a framework for master-planned farm communities and integrated local food systems.

== Examples ==

=== Developments in the urban-rural fringe ===

'''Harvest, North Carolina'''

Harvest&lt;ref&gt;http://wieler.com/communities/harvest/overview/&lt;/ref&gt; is a {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} development introduced in 2008, sited in the [[New Hope River Valley]] in [[Chatham County, North Carolina]].  The development consists of 20 individual properties with an organic farm as the literal and metaphorical center of the community.  A farmbelt easement protects farmland and preserves rural views.

According to Paul McCoy, the previous owner of the land, the Harvest property had been used for farming since the American Revolution.  During the middle of the 20th century, the primary use of the farm was for growing tobacco.  In the late 20th century, the farm was used to grow a typical rotation of tobacco, corn, and soybeans. In 2008, the developer of Harvest began transitioning the farm from conventional operations to organic certification. The change from commercial (i.e. using pesticides) to organic farming will help protect the water quality of nearby Jordan Lake and the Haw River. 

'''Serenbe, Georgia'''

Another example of an urban-rural fringe project that fits into the DSA framework is [[Serenbe]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.serenbecommunity.com/home.html&lt;/ref&gt; This community is located on one of the last undeveloped parcels of land in the [[Atlanta]] area. The founders of Serenbe realized that their largely untouched {{convert|900|acre|km2}} presented a window of opportunity for creating a unique type of residential development. A {{convert|25|acre|m2|adj=on}} organic farm is located at Serenbe that provides organic produce throughout Atlanta and The Chattahoochee Hill Country. The {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of Serenbe lie in the heart of {{convert|40000|acre|km2}} protected with a master plan that calls for 80% green space. Building sites are limited to 220 structures, including live/work spaces and commercial buildings.

'''Middle Green Valley, Solano County, CA'''

One of the largest and most recent examples of development-supported agriculture is in Middle Green Valley in southwestern Solano County, California.  
The City of Fairfield to the south, and unincorporated Solano County to the north, have continued to entitle subdivisions while Green Valley has remained largely undeveloped agricultural land and open space.  Like many places at the edge of suburban boundaries, there has been a longstanding conflict between the open space desired by neighbors and development rights desired by landowners.  The landowners in this part of Green Valley have been under pressure to preserve the rural culture, even as the basic economics of agriculture have eroded the financial viability of their lands.  Usually, the only viable choice was to develop their property to realize economic benefit.  Many of the landowners, some whose families have cultivated the land for over 150 years, wished to realize the development value while at the same time maintain the integrity of the open space, agricultural productivity and the farming legacy.

In 2010, at significant cost and with no guarantee of success, the Solano County Board of Supervisors – with meaningful participation from landowners AND neighborhood groups – approved a Specific Plan for Middle Green Valley.  The final plan includes more than 1,400 acres of protected agricultural and open space and a small village of about 400 clustered homes that are shielded from the main views from Green Valley Road.  Over 15 different land owners covering almost 200 acres signed the Master Development Agreement putting this plan into place.  The entire Specific Plan can be obtained at: 

http://www.solanocounty.com/depts/rm/documents/eir/middle_green_valley_specific_plan.asp

Preserving the rural beauty and cultural legacy of the Green Valley area is the guiding vision in crafting a long term, equitable, and sustainable development plan. The Specific Plan celebrates and perpetuates the tradition of the working landscapes that characterize this part of Solano County for over 150 years. A core component is the promotion of sustainable food and agriculture systems as a means to connect agricultural lands, the built and natural environments, community health and natural resource stewardship.

The Green Valley Agricultural Conservancy

To provide assurances for the long-term preservation and management of the open space, the Middle Green Valley Specific Plan envisioned the creation of a non-profit Conservancy (the GVAC) to oversee the ±1,490 acres of productive agricultural land, pastures, and natural areas. The Conservancy has three primary areas of responsibility:

* Assisting and encouraging the farms in Green Valley;
* Overseeing the management, stewardship, enhancement, restoration and access easements for conservation lands; and
* Managing and developing a design review process for the community 

One of the first tangible initiatives by the Conservancy to promote and support local farmers and artisans has been the creation of Totally Local - a new Certified Farmers' Market (CFM) - that was started in July 2011. The Green Valley Farmers' Market provides a community gathering place to share a cup of coffee, meet the local farmers, taste some great local food, and simply have some conversation with neighbors. The Conservancy’s goal is not to compete with, but rather compliment the already established food stands and local artisans in the region to help provide a stable platform for featuring LOCAL agricultural and artisan products.

=== Future possibilities: vertical farming ===

[[Vertical farming]], also known as skyfarming, is a conceptual form of agriculture done in urban high-rises. In these high-rises, food such as fruit, vegetables, fish, and livestock can be raised by using greenhouse growing methods and recycled resources year-round, allowing cities of the future to become self-sufficient. The concept of the vertical farm remains mostly hypothetical; however, many people believe that this type of development will become necessary as a result of increased [[urban density]] and rising energy costs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6431">{{For|the [[molecular biology]] technique|site-directed mutagenesis}}

'''Directed mutagenesis''', also known as '''directed mutation''', was a [[hypothesis]] proposing that organisms can respond to environmental stresses by [[orthogenesis|orthogenetically]] directing [[Evolution#Mutation|mutations]] to certain [[genes]] or areas of the [[genome]].

==History==

===Early work===
{{further|Mutationism|Orthogenesis}}

The Russian ichthyologist [[Lev Berg]] proposed directed mass mutations as the main mechanism for evolution in his anti-Darwinian book ''Nomogenesis; or, Evolution Determined by Law'' (1922). Berg's theory was both [[mutationist]] (involving mutation in place of selection) and [[orthogenetic]] (involving direction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Georgy S. |last=Levit |first2=Lennart |last2=Olsson |chapter=Evolution on Rails: Mechanisms and Levels of Orthogenesis |editor-last=Wissemann |editor-first=Volker |title=Annals of the History and Philosophy of Biology |volume=11 |year=2006 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJso832AGXEC&amp;pg=PA112 |publisher=Universitätsverlag Göttingen |isbn=978-3-938616-85-7 |pages=112–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early studies of "directed mutation" were performed by German geneticists. [[Richard Goldschmidt]] claimed to have produced evidence for directed mutation in 1929 in his experiments on ''[[Drosophila]]'' fruit flies exposed to elevated temperatures. Viktor Jollos (1887–1941) in the 1930s had also carried out experiments on ''Drosophila'' and written that his results had confirmed Goldschmidt's work which was evidence for directed mutation in contrast to [[natural selection]]. However, later American geneticists were unable to replicate these experiments and the concepts fell out of favour compared to the standard Darwinian mechanism of randomly occurring [[Evolution#Mutation|mutations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jonathan |last=Harwood |chapter=3. Genetics and the Evolutionary Process |title=Styles of Scientific Thought: The German Genetics Community, 1900–1933 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dygUxfsyaTwC&amp;pg=PA121 |date=15 February 1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-31882-0 |pages=121–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Igor |last=Popov |title=The Problem of Constraints on Variation from Darwin to the Present |format=PDF |url=http://www.ludusvitalis.org/textos/32/32-11_popov.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent studies===

Directed mutagenesis was re-proposed in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cairns, J.; Overbaugh, J.; Miller, S. |title=The origin of mutants |journal=Nature |volume=335 |issue=6186 |pages=142–5 |date=September 1988  |pmid=3045565 |doi=10.1038/335142a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v335/n6186/abs/335142a0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[John Cairns (biochemist)|John Cairns]] who was studying ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' that lacked the ability to [[metabolize]] [[lactose]].  He grew these bacteria in [[Growth medium|media]] in which lactose was the only source of [[energy]].  In doing so, he found that the rate at which the bacteria [[evolved]] the ability to metabolize lactose was many [[orders of magnitude]] higher than would be expected if the [[mutations]] were truly [[random]].  This inspired him to propose that the mutations that had occurred had been ''directed'' at those genes involved in lactose utilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=N |last=Symonds |title=A fitter theory of evolution?: Biologists have always denied that organisms can adapt their genes to suit a new environment.

Later support for this hypothesis came from Susan Rosenberg, then at the [[University of Alberta]], who found that an enzyme involved in [[DNA repair|DNA recombinational repair]], [[recBCD]], was necessary for the directed mutagenesis observed by Cairns and colleagues in 1989. The directed mutagenesis hypothesis was challenged in 2002, by work showing that the phenomenon was due to general [[Somatic hypermutation|hypermutability]] due to selected gene amplification, followed by natural selection, and was thus a standard [[Darwinian]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Slechta |first=E.

{{Anthropology |methods}}

In [[anthropology]], [[folkloristics]], and the [[social sciences|social]] and [[behavioral sciences]], '''emic''' and '''etic''' refer to two kinds of [[field research]] done and viewpoints obtained:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.sil.org/~headlandt/ee-intro.htm |title=EE intro |publisher=SIL}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''emic,'' from within the [[social group]] (from the perspective of the subject) and ''etic,'' from outside (from the perspective of the observer).

==Definitions==
"The emic approach investigates how local people think" (Kottak, 2006): How they perceive and categorize the world, their rules for behavior, what has meaning for them, and how they imagine and explain things. "The etic (scientist-oriented) approach shifts the focus from local observations, categories, explanations, and interpretations to those of the anthropologist.  The etic approach realizes that members of a culture often are too involved in what they are doing..... to interpret their cultures impartially. When using the etic approach, the [[ethnographer]] emphasizes what he or she considers important."&lt;ref&gt;Kottak, Conrad (2006). ''Mirror for Humanity'', p. 47. McGraw-Hill, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-07-803490-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although emics and etics are sometimes regarded as inherently in conflict and one can be preferred to the exclusion of the other, the complementarity of emic and etic approaches to anthropological research has been widely recognized, especially in the areas of interest concerning the characteristics of human nature as well as the form and function of human social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Jingfeng, Xia (2013). ''An Anthropological Emic-Etic Perspective On Open Access Practices'' Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote | …Emic knowledge and interpretations are those existing within a culture, that are ‘determined by local custom, meaning, and belief’ (Ager and Loughry, 2004: n.p.) and best described by a 'native' of the culture. Etic knowledge refers to generalizations about human behavior that are considered universally true, and commonly links cultural practices to factors of interest to the researcher, such as economic or ecological conditions, that cultural insiders may not consider very relevant (Morris et al., 1999).}}
Emic and etic approaches of understanding behavior and personality fall under the study of cultural anthropology. [[Cultural anthropology]] states that people are shaped by their cultures and their subcultures, and we must account for this in the study of personality.  One way is looking at things through an emic approach. This approach "is culture specific because it focuses on a single culture and it is understood on its own terms."  As explained below, the term "emic" originated from the specific linguistic term "phonemic", from ''[[phoneme]]'', which is a language-specific way of abstracting [[speech sound]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Friedman | first1 = Howard S | first2 = Miriam W | last2 = Schustack | title = Personality: Classic Theories and Modern Research | place = Boston | publisher = Pearson Allyn &amp; Bacon | year = 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://psychology.geckos.sis.org.cn/2011/10/using-one-or-more-examples-explain-emic-and-etic-concepts-akane/ |title=Using one or more examples explain emic &amp; etic concepts |last=Akane |publisher=SIS |place=[[China|CN]] |date=October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121203103812/http://psychology.geckos.sis.org.cn/2011/10/using-one-or-more-examples-explain-emic-and-etic-concepts-akane/ |archivedate=2012-12-03 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*An 'emic' account is a description of behavior or a belief in terms meaningful (consciously or unconsciously) to the actor; that is, an emic account comes from a person within the culture.  Almost anything from within a culture can provide an emic account.
*An 'etic' account is a description of a [[behavior]] or belief by a social analyst or scientific observer (a student or scholar of anthropology or sociology, for example), in terms that can be applied across cultures; that is, an etic account attempts to be 'culturally neutral', limiting any ethnocentric, political, and/or cultural bias or alienation by the observer.
When these two approaches are combined, the “richest” view of a culture or society can be understood. On its own, an emic approach would struggle with applying overarching values to a single culture. The etic approach is helpful in enabling researchers to see more than one aspect of one culture, and in applying observations to cultures around the world.

==History==
The terms were coined in 1954 by linguist [[Kenneth Pike]], who argued that the tools developed for describing [[linguistics|linguistic]] behaviors could be adapted to the description of any human social behavior. As Pike noted, social scientists have long debated whether their knowledge is objective or subjective.  Pike's innovation was to turn away from an [[epistemological]] debate, and turn instead to a methodological solution. ''Emic'' and ''etic'' are derived from the [[Linguistics|linguistic]] terms [[phoneme|phonemic]] and [[phonetic]] respectively, which are in turn derived from Greek roots.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, H.G. &amp; Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones. with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of a truly objective description was discounted by Pike himself in his original work; he proposed the emic/etic dichotomy in anthropology as a way around philosophic issues about the very nature of [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The terms were also championed by [[anthropology|anthropologists]] [[Ward Goodenough]] and [[Marvin Harris]] with slightly different connotations from those used by Pike. Goodenough was primarily interested in understanding the culturally specific meaning of specific beliefs and practices; Harris was primarily interested in explaining human behavior.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Pike, Harris, and others have argued that cultural "insiders" and "outsiders" are equally capable of producing emic ''and'' etic accounts of their culture. Some researchers use "etic" to refer to objective or outsider accounts, and "emic" to refer to subjective or insider accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/~headlandt/ee-intro.htm|title=Thomas N. Headland: Controversies: Etic-Emic Introduction|website=Sil.org|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Mead]] was an anthropologist who studied the patterns of adolescence in Samoa. She discovered that the difficulties and the transitions that adolescents faced are culturally influenced. The hormones that are released during puberty can be defined using an etic framework, because [[adolescents]] globally have the same [[hormones]] being secreted. However, Mead concluded that how adolescents respond to these hormones is greatly influenced by their cultural norms. Through her studies, Mead found that simple classifications about behaviors and [[personality]] could not be used because peoples’ cultures influenced their behaviors in such a radical way.  Her studies helped create an emic approach of understanding behaviors and personality. Her research deduced that culture has a significant impact in shaping an individual’s personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/mead/field-sepik.html|title=Papua New Guinea: Sex and Temperament - Margaret Mead: Human Nature and the Power of Culture - Exhibitions - Library of Congress|work=loc.gov|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]], a Swiss [[psychoanalyst]], is a researcher who took an etic approach in his studies. Jung studied [[mythology]], [[religion]], ancient rituals, and [[dreams]] leading him to believe that there are [[archetypes]] that can be identified and used to categorize people’s behaviors. Archetypes are universal structures of the collective unconscious that refer to the inherent way people are predisposed to perceive and process information.  The main archetypes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/personalitydevelopment/tp/archetypes.htm|title=What Are Jung's 4 Major Archetypes?|author=Kendra Cherry|work=About.com Education|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Jung studied were the [[persona]] (how people choose to present themselves to the world), the [[anima and animus|animus]]/ anima (part of people experiencing the world in viewing the opposite sex, that guides how they select their romantic partner), and the [[shadow]] (dark side of personalities because people have a concept of evil. Well-adjusted people must integrate both good and bad parts of themselves). Jung looked at the role of the [[mother]] and deduced that all people have mothers and see their mothers in a similar way; they offer nurture and comfort. His studies also suggest that “infants have evolved to suck milk from the breast, it is also the case that all children have inborn tendencies to react in certain ways.” This way of looking at the mother is an etic way of applying a concept cross-culturally and universally.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Importance as regards personality==
Emic and etic approaches are important to understanding personality because problems can arise “when concepts, measures, and methods are carelessly transferred to other cultures in attempts to make cross- cultural generalizations about personality.” It is hard to apply certain generalizations of behavior to people who are so diverse and culturally different. One example of this is the F-scale (Macleod).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/authoritarian-personality.html|title=Theories of Personality|work=simplypsychology.org|accessdate=21 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024113220/http://www.simplypsychology.org/authoritarian-personality.html|archivedate=24 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]], which was created by [[Theodor Adorno]], is used to measure [[Authoritarian Personality]], which can, in turn, be used to predict prejudiced behaviors. This test, when applied to Americans accurately depicts [[prejudices]] towards black individuals. However, when a study was conducted in [[South Africa]] using the F-Scale, (Pettigrew and Friedman) &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; results did not predict any anti-Black prejudices. This study used emic approaches of study by conducting interviews with the locals and etic approaches by giving participants generalized personality tests.

An '''epiphenomenon''' (plural: '''epiphenomena''') is a secondary [[phenomenon]] that occurs alongside or in parallel to a primary phenomenon. The word has two [[word sense|senses]],&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{Citation |author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://ahdictionary.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; one that [[connotation|connotes]] known [[causality|causation]] and one that connotes absence of causation or reservation of judgment about it.&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt;

==Examples==
===Metaphysics===
{{Main|Causality}}
The problem of epiphenomena is often a counterexample to theories of causation and is identified with situations in which an event E is caused by (or, is said to be caused by) an event C, which also causes (or, is said to cause) an event F. For example, take a simplified Lewisian counterfactual analysis of causation that the meaning of propositions about causal relationships between two events A and B can be explained in terms of counterfactual conditionals of the form “if A had not occurred then B would not have occurred”. Suppose that C causes E necessarily and that C has an epiphenomenon F necessarily. We then have that if E had not occurred, then F would not have occurred, either. But then according to the counterfactual analysis of causation, the proposition that there is a causal dependence of F on E is true; that is, on this view, E caused F. Since this is not in line with how we ordinarily speak about causation (we would not say that E caused F), a counterfactual analysis seems to be insufficient.

===Philosophy of mind and psychology===
{{Main|Epiphenomenalism}}
An epiphenomenon can be an effect of primary phenomena, but cannot affect a primary phenomenon. In [[philosophy of mind]], [[epiphenomenalism]] is the view that [[mind|mental]] phenomena are epiphenomena in that they can be caused by physical phenomena, but cannot cause physical phenomena.  In strong epiphenomenalism, epiphenomena that are mental phenomena can ''only'' be caused by physical phenomena, not by other mental phenomena.  In weak epiphenomenalism, epiphenomena that are mental phenomena can be caused by both physical phenomena and other mental phenomena, but mental phenomena cannot be the cause of any physical phenomenon.  

The [[physical world]] operates independently of the [[mental world]] in epiphenomenalism; the mental world exists as a derivative [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] to the physical world, affected by the physical world (and by other epiphenomena in weak epiphenomenalism), but not able to have an effect on the physical world.  [[Instrumentalism|Instrumentalist]] versions of epiphenomenalism allow some mental phenomena to cause physical phenomena, when those mental phenomena can be strictly analyzable as summaries of physical phenomena, preserving causality of the physical world to be strictly analyzable by other physical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Taylor (philosopher)|Taylor, Richard]] (1963). ''Metaphysics''. First Edition. Eaglewood Cliffs, Prentice-Hall.    &lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
In the more general use of the word, a [[causality|causal relationship]] between the phenomena is implied;&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt; the epiphenomenon is a consequence of the primary phenomenon.&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt; This is the [[word sense|sense]] that is related to the noun ''[[epiphenomenalism]]''.

However, in [[medicine]], this relationship is typically ''not'' implied, and the word is usually used in its second sense: an epiphenomenon may occur independently, and is called an epiphenomenon because it is not the primary phenomenon under study or because only [[correlation]], not [[causality|causation]], is known or suspected. In this sense, saying that X is [[association (statistics)|associated with]] Y as an epiphenomenon is preserving an acknowledgment that [[correlation does not imply causation]]. [[Medical sign|Signs]], [[symptom]]s, [[syndrome]]s (groups of symptoms), and [[risk factor]]s can all be epiphenomena in this sense. For example, having an increased risk of [[breast cancer]] concurrent with taking an [[antibiotic]] is an epiphenomenon. It is not the antibiotic that is causing the increased risk, but the increased [[inflammation]] associated with the bacterial [[infection]] that prompted the taking of an antibiotic. The [[metaphor]] of a [[tree]] is one way of helping to explain the difference to someone struggling to understand. If the infection is the root of the tree, and the inflammation is the trunk, then the cancer and the antibiotic are two branches; the antibiotic is not the trunk.

===Electromagnetism===
Although [[electronics]] is said to be due to the influence of [[electron]]s, the standard approach to the study of electrical phenomena due to [[James Clerk Maxwell]] views these particles as secondary:
:In [[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism|Maxwell’s theory]], [[electric charge|charge]] and [[electric current|current]] are 'epiphenomena' (secondary appearances) of underlying processes in what he termed, following [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]], the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s. Indeed, Maxwell’s mature theory stays completely away from microstructure of matter and from any consideration of ‘electric substance’. Instead he proposed that certain quantities should be defined at every point in space, such that relations between them (the [[Maxwell equations]]) and functions of them (such as energy functions) determine phenomena. These quantities (the [[vector field|fields]]) may depend on microphysical events, and indeed Maxwell did expend some effort in his early papers on attempting to explain qualitatively how their relations could result in mechanical motions. However, the theory explains only large-scale phenomena, and it is not necessary to have the microscopic model in mind in order to work successfully with it.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Archibald (1994) "Mathematical theories of electricity and magnetism to 1900", in ''Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences'',  volume 2, page 1216, [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] editor, [[Routledge]] {{ISBN|0-415-09239-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
                
===Free will===
According to epiphenomenalism, [[free will]] having an effect on the physical world is an illusion,&lt;ref&gt;[[Shaun Gallagher|Gallagher, Shaun]]; in: Does consciousness cause behavior? Pockett, Susan (ed.); Banks, William P. (ed.); Gallagher, Shaun (ed.); Cambridge, MA,: MIT Press, 2006. pp. 109–124. [Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt; as physical phenomena can only be caused by other physical phenomena.  In weak epiphenomenalism, there is free will to cause some mental effects, allowing for [[mental discipline]] that is directed at other mental phenomena.

===Behaviorism===
Weak versions of [[behaviorism]] in [[psychology]] admit the existence of mental phenomena but not their meaningful study as causes of observable behavior and view mental phenomena as either epiphenomena or linguistic summaries, [[instrumentalism|instruments]] to examine objectively observable physical behavior.

=== Complexity ===
In the field of [[complex systems]], the term epiphenomenon tends to be used interchangeably with "emergent effect".

=== Propositional theory ===
[[Zenon Pylyshyn]] suggested a [[propositional model of cognition]] where people do not conceptualize ideas in images but rather in meaningful relationships.  In this theory, epiphenomena refer to images because they are merely products people conceptualize from their actual thought processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Sternberg|Sternberg, R.]] (2005). Cognitive psychology. 5th ed., Pearson, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pylyshyn defends his claim by explaining that we only see images when we envision the form of an object.  While visualizing objects or actions is a frequent process in our mind, it does not occur when we are considering the meaning behind an action or the non-visual properties of an object.  There are many concepts we simply cannot envision.&lt;ref&gt;Pylyshyn, Z. (2003). Return of the mental image: are there really pictures in the brain? Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7(3), 113–118. doi:10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00003-2&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, when envisioning an image, it changes based on our preconceived notions, suggesting that semantic relations precede visual images.  Unfortunately, the idea of epiphenomena in propositional theory is largely subjective and not [[falsifiable]].&lt;ref&gt;Pylyshyn, Z. (2003). Explaining mental imagery: Now you see it, now you don't. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7(3), 111–112. doi: 10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00004-4&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8475">'''Frequent deliveries''' are a largely ignored but powerful way of leveling apparent demand within a supply chain and thereby reducing [[Mura (Japanese term)|Mura]]. What is perhaps not so obvious is that this will reduce inventory levels and thereby assist progress along the Lean journey at the same time. The historical focus upon carrying full loads, sometimes of only one product, reduces the unit cost of transport but has sometimes hidden the true costs associated with achieving those transport discounts. It is also possible to gain some of these benefits by 'faking' frequent deliveries at the supply site.&lt;ref&gt;The Gold Mine, F &amp; M Ballé, 2005, {{ISBN|0-9743225-6-3}}, p 210&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==

=== Reducing production lot size and raising delivery frequency ===

If we model this idea using a factory that produces three products (Triangles, Circles and Squares) and is making a regular daily delivery to its customer at the end of each day then we can represent this as below.

[[File:FreqDelivsLot4Deliv1.JPG|frame|center|138px|Original Situation]]

Stock builds up during the day until the factory has completed the production campaign of three products each of which is produced in a lot of four. After each lot of four a line-changeover happens, there are in fact three as we must include the one before the first production lot. Stock builds here to a maximum of twelve units. If the number of changeovers were doubled to six then the stock levels would remain the same same all the stock is still on site until the shipment.

The customer is receiving a mix of products that it is likely that they consume (or their in-stock equivalent) during, say, the next day. If the customer consumes the provided products during the day then their stock level will decrease by twelve over the day.

So if the customer will agree to receive half the daily shipment of each product halfway through the day and the second half at the original time of end of day and we reduce lot sizes by a factor of two the factory schedule would look like this.

[[File:FreqDelivsLot2Deliv2.JPG|frame|center|100px|Double the deliveries and halve the lot size]]

We now see that the benefits of the lot size reduction in the stock levels, both at the customer and at the supplying factory. Stock at both locations has been reduced by six. A possible downside for the factory is that it now has twice the changeovers (See [[Single-Minute Exchange of Die]] (SMED)).

If we take this to the extreme where the factory now has a changeover after every [[unit of production]] (single piece flow) and where shipments occur after every campaign (every product has been made) then the factory has this situation.

[[File:FreqDelivsLot1Deliv4.JPG|frame|center|100px|Single piece flow and ship every campaign]]

Now stock levels, again at the customer and supplier, are down to three from twelve. To achieve this cost effectively the changeovers must be very quick.

=== Just raising delivery frequency ===

So starting from the same original situation.

[[File:FreqDelivsLot4Deliv1.JPG|frame|center|138px|Original Situation]]

The factory chooses to just make the deliveries more frequent but not change production lot size, and to keep some extra stock so that deliveries can be exactly as in the model where lot sizes were changed as well.

[[File:FreqDelivsLot4Deliv2.JPG|frame|center|138px|Stock holding and more frequent deliveries]]

Here, although an extra stock of two is constantly being held it can be seen that the deliveries still reduce the holding by six giving a net benefit of four at the factory and six at the customer. This is without changing the production schedule.

If, again, this is taken to the extreme where deliveries are going to be made of one unit of each product and stock keeping adjusted to make this possible then this situation is seen.

[[File:FreqDelivsLot4Deliv4.JPG|frame|center|138px|Stock holding and most frequent deliveries]]

Here, although an extra stock of three is constantly being held it can be seen that the deliveries still reduce the holding by nine giving a net benefit of six at the factory and nine at the customer. This is still without changing the production schedule.

=== Summary ===

So from this example it can be seen that just increasing delivery frequency reduces the stock held in the system. This is no surprise to those in the context of station to station within a factory. It does seem to surprise many when used in the context of supplier to customer. The summary of this argument is in the table below.

| 12 || 8 || 6
|-
! Lot size 2
| 12 || 6 || 4
|-
! Lot size 1
| 12 || 6 || 3
|}

== Implementation ==

So now the question is how to achieve this more frequent delivery. Well in fact many of the benefits within the factory can be achieved by 'faking' frequent deliveries while discussions with the customer about actual delivery frequencies takes place.

=== Faking frequent deliveries ===

The removal of items in the factory from the 'manufacturing system' will trigger the resupply that we wish to smooth via [[kanban]] or other signals. The frequent deliveries will provide a smoother sequence of smaller resupply signals. So by 'faking it' what is meant is that the actual delivery schedule will be de-coupled from the resupply triggers in the factory.

This can be done by marking a position on the floor, say a rectangular outline of perhaps the same size as the truck, in the loading bay and designating it to be a specific planned delivery or part of one. Let's call that outline a 'virtual truck'. Clearly if all the items for the delivery were now loaded into the virtual truck then the impact on demand signals into the factory would be the same as a real truck load. The secret here is to schedule a steady flow of items from the factory into the virtual truck so that demand appears as flat as possible. Obviously this may seem like 'smoke and mirrors' since the goods are still actually in the loading bay. The importance is that demand and supply are now decoupled. So whilst a real truck can still be loaded at the required speed, from the virtual truck, the signals for resupply passing via kanbans etc. back into the factory have created a smooth demand. This method can also be used to give early warning to the factory that it is falling behind the required schedule if it is to have all goods ready for shipment when the real truck arrives.

The downside of this trick is that there are now two movements of the goods, one to the virtual truck and one from it to the real truck.

=== Actual frequent deliveries ===

Since these need to meet agreement with the customer these will be less flexible than the 'virtual truck's' unless they are part of an internal process. Between 1982 and 1990 Toyota reorganised its service and crash parts business and as part of that it established Local Distribution Centres (LDCs) in each metropolitan centre.&lt;ref&gt;Womack, James P. and Jones, Daniel T. (1998), Lean Thinking Free Press, {{ISBN|0-7432-4927-5}}, p 85&lt;/ref&gt; It also encouraged dealers to work intensively with customers so that maintenance was scheduled sufficiently in advance that parts requirements could be precisely predicted.

Because the LDCs are so close to the dealers it was possible to establish a 'milk run' which visited every dealer every two hours. So when the service is booked a prelimiinary order is prepared for the required parts. The day before the scheduled service the customer is called to confirm the service and then a firm order to the LDC is placed for delivery on the next 'milk run'. Finally, when the car arrives for its service it is inspected and any other required parts ordered for delivery with 2–4 hours (the next run). This has resulted in very significant stock reductions throughout the system as the table below illustrates.

[[File:Cholera bacteria SEM.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Scanning electron microscope]] image of ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]''. This is the bacterium that causes [[cholera]].]]

The '''germ theory of disease''' is the currently accepted [[scientific theory]] of disease. It states that many [[disease]]s are caused by [[microorganism]]s. These small organisms, too small to see without magnification, invade humans, animals, and other living hosts. Their growth and reproduction within their hosts can cause a disease. "Germ" may refer to not just a [[bacterium]] but to any type of microorganism, especially one which causes disease, such as [[protists]], [[fungi]], [[viruses]], [[prions]], or [[viroids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/germ|title=germ – definition of germ in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microorganisms that cause disease are called [[pathogen]]s, and the diseases they cause are called [[infectious disease]]s. Even when a pathogen is the principal cause of a disease, environmental and hereditary factors often influence the severity of the disease, and whether a potential host individual becomes infected when exposed to the pathogen.

The germ theory was proposed by [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] in 1546, and expanded upon by [[Marcus von Plenciz]] in 1762. Such views were held in disdain, however, and [[Galen|Galen's]] [[miasma theory]] remained dominant among scientists and doctors. The nature of this doctrine prevented them from understanding how diseases actually progressed, with predictable consequences. By the early nineteenth century, [[smallpox vaccination]] was commonplace in Europe, though doctors were unaware of how it worked or how to extend the principle to other diseases. Similar treatments had been prevalent in India from just before AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7294/|last1=Henderson|first1=Donald A|last2=Moss|first2=Bernard|title=Smallpox and Vaccinia, Vaccines|year=1999|publisher=W. B. Saunders Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{#tag:ref| In a 1767 report to the College of Physicians in London, John Zephaniah Holwell mentions the practice of Smallpox vaccinations by Ayurvedic doctors and their explanations of the cause of the disease.|group=N}} A transitional period began in the late 1850s with the work of [[Louis Pasteur]].  This work was later extended by [[Robert Koch]] in the 1880s. By the end of the 1880s the miasma theory was struggling to compete with the germ theory of disease. Eventually, a "golden era" of [[bacteriology]] ensued, during which the theory quickly led to the identification of the actual organisms that cause many diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/cholera_prevailingtheories_a2.html|title=BRIEF HISTORY DURING THE SNOW ERA|work=ucla.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/3035/Germ-Theory.html|title=Germ Theory|work=jrank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Viruses were discovered in the 1890s.

== Miasma theory ==
[[File:Cholera art.jpg|thumb|A representation by [[Robert Seymour (illustrator)|Robert Seymour]] of the cholera epidemic depicts the spread of the disease in the form of poisonous air.]]
{{Main article|Miasma theory}}

The miasma theory was the predominant theory of disease transmission before the germ theory took hold towards the end of the 19th century. It held that diseases such as [[cholera]], [[chlamydia infection]], or the [[Black Death]] were caused by a ''[[Miasma theory|miasma]]'' (μίασμα, [[Ancient Greek]]: "pollution"), a noxious form of "bad air" emanating from rotting organic matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution="miasma theory" |title=A Dictionary of Public Health |editor=John M. Last |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |location=Westminster College, Pennsylvania |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t235.e2851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miasma was considered to be a poisonous vapor or mist filled with particles from decomposed matter (miasmata) that was identifiable by its foul smell. The theory posited that diseases were the product of environmental factors such as contaminated water, foul air, and poor hygienic conditions. Such infections, according to the theory, were not passed between individuals but would affect those within a locale that gave rise to such vapors.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

== Development ==

=== Pre-19th century ===

In [[Age of the Earth|Antiquity]], the Greek historian [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 – c. 400 BC) was the first person to state, in his account of the [[plague of Athens]], that diseases could spread from an infected person to others.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Charles and Dorothea (1917) "The scientific position of Girolamo Fracastoro [1478?–1553] with especial reference to the source, character and influence of his theory of infection," ''Annals of Medical History'', '''1''' :  1–34 ; [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015016778261;view=1up;seq=28 see p. 14.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides with Richard Crawley, trans., ''History of the Peloponnesian War'' (London, England:  J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1910), Book III, § 51, [https://archive.org/stream/pelocrawleyr00thucuoft#page/130/mode/2up pp. 131–132.]  From pp. 131–132:  " … there was the awful spectacle of men dying like sheep, through having caught the infection in nursing each other.  This caused the greatest mortality.  On the one hand, if they were afraid to visit each other, they perished from neglect; indeed many houses were emptied of their inmates for want of a nurse: on the other, if they ventured to do so, death was the consequence."&lt;/ref&gt;  One theory of the spread of contagious diseases that were not spread by direct contact was that they were spread by "seeds" (Latin:  ''semina'') that were present in the air.  In his poem, ''De rerum natura'' (On the Nature of Things, ca. 56 BC), the Roman poet [[Lucretius]] (ca. 99 BC – ca. 55 BC) stated that the world contained various "seeds", some of which could sicken a person if they were inhaled or if they contaminated his food.&lt;ref&gt;Nutton, Vivian (1983) "The seeds of disease: an explanation of contagion and infection from the Greeks to the Renaissance," ''Medical History'', '''27''' (1) :  1–34 ; see p. 10. Available at:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139262/?page=23 U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius with Rev. John S. Watson, trans., ''On the Nature of Things'' (London, England:  Henry G. Bohn, 1851), Book VI, lines 1093–1130, pp. 291–292 ; [https://archive.org/stream/onnaturethingsd00carugoog#page/n320/mode/2up see especially p. 292.]  From p. 292:  "This new malady and pest, therefore, either suddenly falls into the water, or penetrates into the very corn, or into other food of men and cattle.  Or even, as may be the case, the infection remains suspended in the air itself; and when, as we breathe, we inhale the air mingled with it, we must necessarily absorb those ''seeds of disease'' into our body."&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roman statesman [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] (116–27 BC) wrote, in his ''Rerum rusticarum libri III'' (Three Books on Agriculture, 36 BC): "Precautions must also be taken in the neighborhood of swamps […] because there are bred certain minute creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and there cause serious diseases."&lt;ref&gt;Varro, Marcus Terentius with Lloyd Storr-Best, trans., ''Varro On Farming'' (London, England:  G. Bell and Sons, Ltd., 1912), Book 1, Ch. XII, [https://archive.org/stream/onfarmingmterent00varruoft#page/38/mode/2up/search/diseases p. 39.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Greek physician Galen (AD 129 – ca. 200/ca. 216) speculated in his ''On Initial Causes'' (ca. AD 175) that some patients might have "seeds of fever".&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''On the Different Types of Fever'' (ca. AD 175), Galen speculated that plagues were spread by "certain seeds of plague", which were present in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  And in his ''Epidemics'' (ca. AD 176–178), Galen explained that patients might relapse during recovery from a fever because some "seed of the disease" lurked in their bodies, which would cause a recurrence of the disease if the patients didn't follow a physician's therapeutic regimen.&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, [[Isidore of Seville]] (ca. 560 – 636) mentioned "plague-bearing seeds" (''pestifera semina'') in his ''On the Nature of Things'' (ca. AD 613).&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 1345, [[Tommaso del Garbo]] (ca. 1305–1370) of Bologna, Italy mentioned Galen's "seeds of plague" in his work ''Commentaria non parum utilia in libros Galeni'' (Helpful commentaries on the books of Galen).&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian scholar and physician Girolamo Fracastoro proposed in 1546 in his book ''De Contagione et Contagiosis Morbis'' that epidemic diseases are caused by transferable seed-like entities (''seminaria morbi'') that transmit infection by direct or indirect contact, or even without contact over long distances. The diseases were categorised based on how they were transmitted, and how long they could lie dormant.

Italian physician [[Francesco Redi]] provided early evidence against [[spontaneous generation]]. He devised an experiment in 1668 in which he used three jars. He placed a [[meatloaf]] and egg in each of the three jars. He had one of the jars open, another one tightly sealed, and the last one covered with gauze. After a few days, he observed that the meatloaf in the open jar was covered by maggots, and the jar covered with gauze had maggots on the surface of the gauze. However, the tightly sealed jar had no maggots inside or outside it. He also noticed that the maggots were found only on surfaces that were accessible by flies. From this he concluded that spontaneous generation is not a plausible theory.

Microorganisms are said to have been first directly observed in the 1670s by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], an early pioneer in [[microbiology]]. Yet [[Athanasius Kircher]] may have done so prior. When Rome was struck by the bubonic plague in 1656, Kircher spent days on end caring for the sick. Searching for a cure, Kircher observed microorganisms under the microscope and invented the germ theory of disease, which he outlined in his ''Scrutinium pestis physico-medicum'' (Rome 1658).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mjt.org/exhibits/kircher.html|title=The Life and Work of Athanaseus Kircher, S.J.|work=mjt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on Leeuwenhoek's work, physician [[Nicolas Andry]] argued in 1700 that microorganisms he called "worms" were responsible for [[smallpox]] and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The History of the Germ Theory|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume= 1 |year=1888|page=312 |issue= 1415 | url = https://archive.org/stream/britishmedicaljo11888brit#page/312/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1720, [[Richard Bradley (botanist)|Richard Bradley]] theorised that the plague and 'all pestilential distempers' were caused by 'poisonous insects', living creatures viewable only with the help of microscopes.&lt;ref name=Santer&gt;Melvin Santer, ‘Richard Bradley: A Unified, Living Agent Theory of the Cause of Infectious Diseases of Plants, Animals, and Humans in the First Decades of the 18th Century’, in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, Volume 52, Number 4, Autumn, 2009, pp. 566-578&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762, the Austrian physician Marcus Antonius von Plenciz (1705-1786) published a book titled ''Opera medico-physica''. It outlined a theory of contagion stating that specific 'animalculae' in the soil and the air were responsible for causing specific diseases. Von Plenciz noted the distinction between diseases which are both epidemic and contagious (like measles and dysentry), and diseases which are contagious but not epidemic (like rabies and leprosy).&lt;ref&gt;Winslow, Charles-Edward Amory (1967). Conquest of Epidemic Disease: A Chapter in the History of Ideas. Hafner Publishing Co Ltd. {{ISBN|978-0028548807}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The book cites Anton van Leeuwenhoek to show how ubiquitous such animalculae are, and was unique for describing the presence of germs in ulcerating wounds. Ultimately, the theory espoused by von Plenciz was not accepted by the scientific community.

=== Agostino Bassi ===
The Italian [[Agostino Bassi]] was the first person to prove that a disease was caused by a microorganism when he conducted a series of experiments between 1808 and 1813, demonstrating that a "vegetable parasite" caused a disease in silkworms known as ''calcinaccio''{{mdash}}this disease was devastating the French silk industry at the time. The "vegetable parasite" is now known to be a fungus pathogenic to insects called ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'' (named after Bassi).

=== Ignaz Semmelweis ===
[[Ignaz Semmelweis]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[obstetrician]] working at the [[Vienna General Hospital]] (''Allgemeines Krankenhaus'') in 1847, noticed the dramatically high maternal mortality from [[puerperal fever]] following births assisted by doctors and medical students. However, those attended by midwives were relatively safe. Investigating further, Semmelweis made the connection between puerperal fever and examinations of delivering women by doctors, and further realized that these physicians had usually come directly from autopsies. Asserting that puerperal fever was a [[Contagious disease|contagious]] disease and that matter from autopsies were implicated in its development, Semmelweis made doctors wash their hands with chlorinated lime water before examining pregnant women.  He then documented a sudden reduction in the mortality rate from 18% to 2.2% over a period of a year.  Despite this evidence, he and his theories were [[Contemporary reaction to Ignaz Semmelweis|rejected]] by most of the contemporary medical establishment.

=== Gideon Mantell ===

[[Gideon Mantell]], the Sussex doctor more famous for discovering [[dinosaur fossils]], spent time with his microscope, and speculated in his ''Thoughts On Animalcules'' (1850) that perhaps "many of the most serious maladies which afflict humanity, are produced by peculiar states of invisible animalcular life".&lt;ref&gt;Pg. 90 of "The invisible world revealed by the microscope or, thoughts on animalcules.", second edition, 1850 (May have appeared in first edition, too. (Revise date in article to 1846, if so.))&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Snow ===
{{Main article|1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak}}
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Original map by John Snow showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854]]
[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] was a skeptic of the then-dominant [[miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]]. Even though the germ theory of disease pioneered by Girolamo Fracastoro had not yet achieved full development or widespread currency,  Snow demonstrated a clear understanding of germ theory in his writings.  He first published his theory in an 1849 essay ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera,''  in which he correctly suggested that the fecal-oral route was the mode of communication, and that the disease replicated itself in the lower intestines.  He even proposed in his 1855 edition of the work, that the structure of cholera was that of a cell.

{{bquote|Having rejected effluvia and the poisoning of the blood in the first instance, and being led to the conclusion that'' ''the disease is something that acts directly on the alimentary canal, the excretions of the sick at once suggest themselves as containing some material which being accidentally swallowed might attach itself to the mucous membrane of the small intestines, and there multiply itself by appropriation of surrounding matter, in virtue of molecular changes going on within it, or capable of going on, as soon as it is placed in congenial circumstances.||John Snow (1849)}}

{{bquote|For the morbid matter of cholera having the property of reproducing its own kind, must necessarily have some sort of structure, most likely that of a cell.  It is no objection to this view that the structure of the cholera poison cannot be recognized by the microscope, for the matter of smallpox and of chancre can only be recognized by their effects, and not by their physical properties.||John Snow (1855)}}

Snow's 1849 recommendation that water be "filtered and boiled before it is used" is one of the first practical applications of germ theory in the area of public health and is the antecedent to the modern [[boil-water advisory]].

In 1855 he published a second edition of his article, documenting his more elaborate investigation of the effect of the water supply in the [[Soho]], London epidemic of 1854.

By talking to local residents, he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now [[Broadwick Street]]). Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the [[Broad Street pump]] did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle. This action has been commonly credited as ending the outbreak, but Snow observed that the epidemic may have already been in rapid decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Snow |title=On the Mode of Communication of Cholera |location=London |publisher=J. Churchill |year=1849 |url=http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/0050707 |quote=There is no doubt that the mortality was much diminished, as I said before, by the flight of the population, which commenced soon after the outbreak; but the attacks had so far diminished before the use of the water was stopped, that it is impossible to decide whether the well still contained the cholera poison in an active state, or whether, from some cause, the water had become free from it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow later used a [[dot distribution map|dot map]] to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump. He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. He showed that the [[Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company]] was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the [[Thames]] and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography. It is regarded as one of the founding events of the science of [[epidemiology]].

Later, researchers discovered that this public well had been dug only three feet from an old [[cesspit]], which had begun to leak fecal bacteria.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The diapers of a baby, who had contracted cholera from another source, had been washed into this cesspit. Its opening was originally under a nearby house, which had been rebuilt farther away after a fire. The city had widened the street and the cesspit was lost. It was common at the time to have a cesspit under most homes. Most families tried to have their raw sewage collected and dumped in the Thames to prevent their cesspit from filling faster than the sewage could decompose into the soil.

After the cholera epidemic had subsided, government officials replaced the handle on the Broad Street pump. They had responded only to the urgent threat posed to the population, and afterward they rejected Snow's theory. To accept his proposal would have meant accepting the fecal-oral method transmission of disease, which they dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Chapelle |chapter=Ch. 5: Hidden Life, Hidden Death |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGVzCQgjEIC&amp;pg=PA82 |title=Wellsprings |location=New Brunswick NJ |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8135-3614-9 |pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Louis Pasteur ===
[[File:Louis Pasteur Experiment.svg|thumb|Louis Pasteur’s pasteurization experiment illustrates the fact that the spoilage of liquid was caused by particles in the air rather than the air itself. These experiments were important pieces of evidence supporting the idea of germ theory of disease.]]
The more formal experiments on the relationship between germ and disease were conducted by Louis Pasteur between the year 1860 and 1864. He discovered the pathology of the puerperal fever&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/pasteur/louis/exgerm/complete.html |chapter=(translated from French) |trans-chapter=On the extension of the germ theory to the etiology of certain common diseases |first=Louis |last=Pasteur |others=Ernst, H.C. (trans) |year=1880 |origyear=May 1880 |title=Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences |volume=XC |pages=1033–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pyogenic vibrio in the blood, and suggested using [[boric acid]] to kill these microorganisms before and after confinement.

Pasteur further demonstrated between 1860 and 1864 that [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] and the growth of microorganisms in [[nutrient broth]]s did not proceed by spontaneous generation. He exposed freshly boiled broth to air in vessels that contained a filter to stop all particles passing through to the growth medium, and even with no filter at all, with air being admitted via a long tortuous tube that would not pass dust particles. Nothing grew in the broths: therefore the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than being generated within the broth.

Pasteur discovered that another serious disease of silkworms, ''[[pébrine]]'', was caused by a small microscopic organism now known as ''[[Nosema bombycis]]'' (1870). Pasteur saved France's silk industry by developing a method to screen silkworms eggs for those that were not infected, a method that is still used today to control this and other silkworm diseases.

=== Robert Koch ===
Robert Koch is known for developing four basic criteria (known as [[Koch's postulates]]) for demonstrating, in a scientifically sound manner, that a disease is caused by a particular organism. These postulates grew out of his seminal work with [[anthrax]] using purified cultures of the pathogen that had been isolated from diseased animals.

Koch's postulates were developed in the 19th century as general guidelines to identify pathogens that could be isolated with the techniques of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walker L, Levine H, Jucker M | title = Koch's postulates and infectious proteins | journal = Acta Neuropathologica | volume = 112 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16703338 | doi = 10.1007/s00401-006-0072-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in Koch's time, it was recognized that some infectious agents were clearly responsible for disease even though they did not fulfill all of the postulates.&lt;ref name=Koch1884 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch 1893"/&gt; Attempts to rigidly apply Koch's postulates to the diagnosis of viral diseases in the late 19th century, at a time when viruses could not be seen or isolated in culture, may have impeded the early development of the field of [[virology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Robert Koch: a life in medicine and bacteriology |author=[[Thomas D. Brock|Brock TD]] |year=1999 |publisher=American Society of Microbiology Press |location=Washington DC |isbn=1-55581-143-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Evans AS |title=Causation and disease: the Henle-Koch postulates revisited |journal=Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=175–95 |date=May 1976 |pmid=782050 |pmc=2595276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, a number of infectious agents are accepted as the cause of disease despite their not fulfilling all of Koch's postulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacomo V, Kelly P, Raoult D |title=Natural history of ''Bartonella'' infections (an exception to Koch's postulate) |journal=Clinical and Diagnostic Laboratory Immunology |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=8–18 |year=2002 |pmid=11777823 |doi=10.1128/CDLI.9.1.8-18.2002 |pmc=119901}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, while Koch's postulates retain historical importance and continue to inform the approach to microbiologic diagnosis, fulfillment of all four postulates is not required to demonstrate causality.

Koch's postulates have also influenced scientists who examine microbial pathogenesis from a molecular point of view. In the 1980s, a [[molecular Koch's postulates|molecular version]] of Koch's postulates was developed to guide the identification of microbial genes encoding [[virulence]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Falkow S |title=Molecular Koch's postulates applied to microbial pathogenicity |journal=Reviews of Infectious Diseases |volume=10 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=S274–6 |year=1988 |pmid=3055197 |doi=10.1093/cid/10.Supplement_2.S274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Koch's postulates:'''
# The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease, but should not be found in healthy organisms.
# The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure [[cell culture|culture]].
# The cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.
# The microorganism must be reisolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.

However, Koch abandoned the universalist requirement of the first postulate altogether when he discovered asymptomatic carriers of cholera&lt;ref name="Koch 1893"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koch Robert |title=Über den augenblicklichen Stand der bakteriologischen Choleradiagnose |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift für Hygiene und Infektionskrankheiten |year=1893 |volume=14 |pages=319–333 |doi=10.1007/BF02284324}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, later, of [[typhoid fever]]. [[Asymptomatic]] or [[subclinical infection]] carriers are now known to be a common feature of many infectious diseases, especially viruses such as [[polio]], [[herpes simplex]], [[HIV]], and [[hepatitis C]]. As a specific example, all doctors and virologists agree that [[poliovirus]] causes paralysis in just a few infected subjects, and the success of the [[polio vaccine]] in preventing disease supports the conviction that the poliovirus is the causative agent.

The third postulate specifies "should", not "must", because as Koch himself proved in regard to both [[tuberculosis]] and cholera,&lt;ref name=Koch1884&gt;{{cite book |author=Koch Robert |year=1884 |title=Mittheilungen aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte |chapter=Die Aetiologie der Tuberkulose |volume=2 |pages=1–88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- see also: Conferenz zur Erörterung der Cholerafrage im Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamt [Conference to discuss the matter of cholera at the Imperial Health Office]. ''Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift'' 10 (1884), pages 499-507, 519-532 --&gt; not all organisms exposed to an infectious agent will acquire the infection. Noninfection may be due to such factors as general health and proper immune functioning; acquired immunity from previous exposure or vaccination; or genetic immunity, as with the resistance to malaria conferred by possessing at least one sickle cell allele.

The second postulate may also be suspended for certain microorganisms or entities that cannot (at the present time) be grown in pure culture, such as prions responsible for [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Inglis TJ |title=Principia aetiologica: taking causality beyond Koch's postulates |journal=Journal of Medical Microbiology |volume=56 |issue=Pt 11 |pages=1419–22 |date=November 2007 |pmid=17965339 |doi=10.1099/jmm.0.47179-0 |url=http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/56/11/1419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In summary, a body of evidence that satisfies Koch's postulates is sufficient but not necessary to establish causation.

== Sanitation ==
In the 1870s, [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] was instrumental in developing practical applications of the germ theory of disease with respect to sanitation in medical settings and aseptic surgical techniques—partly through the use of carbolic acid ([[phenol]]) as an antiseptic.

'''Gualdrada''' was a member of the nobility in 12th century [[Florence]], [[Italy]].  She was a daughter of Bellincion Berti, &lt;ref&gt;mention made of Bellincion Berti in [[s:The Divine Comedy/Paradiso/Canto XV|The Divine Comedy/Paradiso/Canto XV - Wikisource]]. Ubertino Donato was the son-in-law to Bellincion Berti - [http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Divine-Comedy-of-Dante--Paradisex30614.html see notes] in the Divine Comedy, by Alighieri Dante: ''Paradise Canto XVI.''&lt;/ref&gt; being a descendent of the Ravignani family,  a branch of the Adimari family. 

==Biography==
[[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''On Famous Women (De mulieribus claris)'' biography 103 tells her twelfth century story. During a festival in a [[Florence|Florentine]] Church of Saint John the Baptist, the [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Otto IV]] came to the city and entered the church with his entourage.  From his seat he spotted Gualdrada and was impressed with her beauty.  He admired her innocence in youth, the way she dressed, and her personality. He asked an elderly gentleman that was near him, &lt;blockquote&gt;''Who, pray tell, is that girl there facing us with the beautiful face that in my opinion surpasses all the others in dignity?''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The emperor did not know that he was asking her father. Bellincion answered the emperor, saying, &lt;blockquote&gt; ''Your Majesty, whoever she may be, she will kiss you at my bidding if you desire.'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gualdrada overheard this and was embarrassed and wished that her father would not be so bold with his offers. She immediately replied,&lt;blockquote&gt;''Father, please stop. Speak no more. For by Heaven, unless force is used, absolutely no one except the man to whom you will give me in lawful and holy matrimony shall receive what you are offering so freely.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Emperor was both stunned and impressed by this response from Gualdrada. Learning that he was speaking to her father, he praised her in an eloquent speech to everyone of her virtue. As he was leaving the festival he summoned one of his barons, called Guido, and promoted him to a count. He then presented to Gualdrada a large dowry consisting of [[Casentino]] and a part of the territory of [[Romagna]]. Gualdrada was then given to Guido in marriage. 

From the marriage of Gualdrada and Guido came two sons, Guglielmo and Ruggieri. Ruggieri was the father of Guidoguerra, a leader of a group of four hundred Florentines of the [[Guelf]] party. They were contributory to the victory in 1265 of [[Charles of Anjou]] at [[Benevento]] over [[Manfred of Sicily]].  In 1266 Charles became [[List of monarchs of Sicily|King of Sicily]].

In [[cultural anthropology]], the distinction between a '''guilt society''' (or '''guilt culture'''), '''shame society''' (also '''shame culture''' or '''honor-shame culture'''), and a '''fear society''' (or [[culture of fear]]) has been used to categorize different cultures.  The differences can apply to how behavior is governed with respect to government laws, business rules, or social etiquette. This classification has been applied especially to [[Apollonian and Dionysian#In_anthropology|apollonian]] societies, sorting them according to the emotions they use to control individuals (especially children) and maintaining [[social order]], swaying them into norm obedience and conformity.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Alan [https://books.google.com/books?id=gqyiX6bg0TYC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161 ''Jews, Myth and History: A Critical Exploration of Contemporary Jewish Belief ''] p.161&lt;/ref&gt; 

* In a [[guilt society]], control is maintained by creating and continually reinforcing the feeling of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] (and the expectation of [[punishment]] now or in the [[afterlife]]) for certain condemned behaviors. The guilt-innocence world view focuses on law and punishment.  A person in this type of culture may ask, "Is my behavior fair or unfair?"{{fact|date=June 2018}}  This type of culture also emphasizes individual [[conscience]].&lt;ref name="DeMente96p79"/&gt; 
* In a shame society, the means of control is the [[inculcation]] of [[shame]] and the complementary threat of [[social rejection|ostracism]]. The shame-honor worldview seeks an "honor balance" and can lead to [[revenge#Revenge dynamics|revenge dynamics]].{{fact|date=June 2018}}  A person in this type of culture may ask, "Shall I look ashamed if I do X?" or "How people will look at me if I do Y?"  Shame cultures are typically based on the concepts of [[pride]] and [[honour]],&lt;ref name="LloydJones1983p26"&gt;Lloyd-Jones, Hugh (1983) [https://books.google.com/books?id=68j3DZ-a04YC&amp;pg=PA26 ''The Justice of Zeus'']&lt;/ref&gt; and appearances are what counts.
* In a fear society, control is kept by the [[fear]] of retribution. The fear-power worldview focuses on physical dominance.  A person in this culture may ask, "Will someone hurt me if I do this?"{{fact|date=January 2018}}

The terminology were popularized by [[Ruth Benedict]] in ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'', who described [[American culture]] as a "guilt culture" and [[Japanese culture]] as a "shame culture".&lt;ref&gt;Ezra F. Vogel, Foreword, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword (Boston: Houghton Mifflin 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ying and Wong. "Cultural Models of Shame and Guilt". ''Cultural Influences''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the same person may emphasize different considerations depending on the situation, government and business projects that bring together people from different types of cultures may experience problems.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==Guilt societies==

In a guilt society, the primary method of [[social control]] is the [[inculcation]] of feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] for behaviors that the individual believes to be undesirable. A prominent feature of guilt societies is the provision of sanctioned releases from guilt for certain behaviors, whether before or after the fact.  There is opportunity in such cases for authority figures to derive power, monetary and/or other advantages, etc. by manipulating the conditions of guilt and the forgiveness of guilt.

[[Paul Hiebert (missiologist)|Paul Hiebert]] characterizes the guilt society as follows:

:Guilt is a feeling that arises when we violate the absolute standards of [[morality]] within us, when we violate our conscience. A person may suffer from guilt although no one else knows of his or her misdeed; this feeling of guilt is relieved by confessing the misdeed and making restitution. True guilt cultures rely on an internalized conviction of sin as the enforcer of good behavior, not, as shame cultures do, on external sanctions. Guilt cultures emphasize punishment and forgiveness as ways of restoring the moral order; shame cultures stress self-denial and humility as ways of restoring the social order. (Hiebert 1985, 213)

==Geographical distribution==
* Guilt-Innocence: more associated with Catholicism and Judaism{{fact|date=June 2018}}
* Shame-Honour: more associated with Islam, Protestantism, and Eastern religions{{fact|date=June 2018}}
* Fear-Power: more associated with animist and tribal societies{{fact|date=June 2018}}

===England===
[[Anglo-Saxon England]] is particularly notable as a shame culture, and this trait survived even after [[Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England|its conversion to Christianity]], which is typically a guilt culture.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Bjork, John D. Niles (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=SaFdpGdjvtoC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;lpg=PA285 ''A Beowulf Handbook''] p.285 quotation: {{quotation|The introduction of a new state-sanctioned (or ruler-sanctioned) religion does not necessarily effect radical changes in a culture's basic structure of values. Not only ''Beowulf'' but the ''Maxims'' of the Exeter Book — "Dom bib selast" (Fame is best, 80) — and  ''The Battle of Maldon'' attest to the vitality of the shame culture and its values in Anglo-Saxon England long after the Conversion. The theme of "worship" (i.e., Anglo-Saxon weordscipe [honor]) running through Malory's stories suggests that the ethos of the shame culture survived both the Conversion and the Conquest.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of shame culture under Christianity are the cultures of [[Mexico]],&lt;ref name="DeMente96p79"&gt;De Mente, Boye Lafayette (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=RL_UsrfTICoC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79 ''There's a Word for It in Mexico''] pp.79-80&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andalusia]]&lt;ref name="LloydJones1983p26"/&gt; and generally Christian [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean societies]].&lt;ref&gt;Satlow, Michael L. (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XJjXAAAAMAAJ ''Tasting the dish: rabbinic rhetorics of sexuality''] p.142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odd Magne Bakke (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=cI1btFqWegoC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305 ''"Concord and Peace"''] p.305&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
In China, the concept of shame is widely accepted&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bedford|first1=Olwen|title=Source:2014 Journal Citation Reports® (Thomson Reuters, 2015) The Individual Experience of Guilt and Shame in Chinese Culture|journal=Culture &amp; Psychology|date=2004|volume=10|issue=1|pages=29–52|doi=10.1177/1354067X04040929}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to [[Confucianism|Confucian]] teachings. In ''[[Analects]]'', [[Confucius]] is quoted as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lead the people with administrative injunctions and put them in their place with penal law, and they will avoid punishments but will be without a sense of shame. Lead them with excellence and put them in their place through roles and ritual practices, and in addition to developing a sense of shame, they will order themselves harmoniously.&lt;ref&gt;Confucius, ''The Analects''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Japan ===
The society of traditional [[Japan]] was long held to be a good example of one in which shame is the primary agent of social control.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} The first book to cogently explain the workings of the Japanese society for the Western reader was ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' by [[Ruth Benedict]]. This book was produced under less than ideal circumstances since it was written during the early years of [[World War II]] in an attempt to understand the people who had become such a powerful enemy of the West. Under the conditions of war, it was impossible to do [[field research]] in Japan.

Without being able to study in Japan, Benedict relied on newspaper clippings, histories, literature, films, and interviews of [[Japanese-American]]s. Her studies came to conclusions about Japanese culture and society that are still widely criticized today, both in America and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kent|first=Pauline|title=Japanese Perceptions of The Chrysanthemum and the Sword|journal=Dialectical Anthropology|date=June 1999|volume=24|issue=2|pages=181–192|doi=10.1023/a:1007082930663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Romani ===
To the [[Romani people|Roma]], though living as local minorities in mostly [[Christianity|Christian]] or [[Islam]]ic societies, the concept of ''lajav'' ("shame") is important, while the concept of ''bezax'' ("sin") does not have such significance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Delia Grigore]], ''Rromanipen-ul (rromani dharma) şi mistica familiei'' "Rromanipen (Rromani Dharma) and the Family Mystics" (2001, Salvaţi copiii, Bucharest)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], '''Hamilton's principle''' is [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s formulation of the [[principle of stationary action]] (see that article for historical formulations). It states that the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of a physical system is determined by a [[calculus of variations|variational problem]] for a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] based on a single function, the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]], which contains all physical information concerning the system and the forces acting on it. The variational problem is equivalent to and allows for the derivation of the ''[[differential equation|differential]]'' [[equations of motion]] of the physical system.  Although formulated originally for [[classical mechanics]], Hamilton's principle also applies to classical [[field (physics)|fields]] such as the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] and [[gravity|gravitational]] [[field (physics)|fields]], and plays an important role in [[quantum mechanics]], [[quantum field theory]] and criticality theories.

Penrose| title=[[The Road to Reality]]| publisher= Vintage books| year=2007 | page = 474|isbn=0-679-77631-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Mathematical formulation==

Hamilton's principle states that the true evolution '''q'''(''t'') of a system described by ''N'' [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;) between two specified states '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = '''q'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = '''q'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at two specified times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[stationary point]] (a point where the [[Calculus of variations|variation]] is zero), of the [[action (physics)|action]] [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{S}[\mathbf{q}] \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  
\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}(t),\dot{\mathbf{q}}(t),t)\, dt 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}},t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] [[function (mathematics)|function]] for the system.  In other words, any ''first-order'' perturbation of the true evolution results in (at most) ''second-order'' changes in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;.  The action &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]], i.e., something that takes as its input a [[function (mathematics)|function]] and returns a single number, a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]].  In terms of [[functional analysis]], Hamilton's principle states that the true evolution of a physical system is a solution of the functional equation

{{Equation box 1

\frac{\delta \mathcal{S}}{\delta \mathbf{q}(t)}=0
&lt;/math&gt;

===Euler–Lagrange equations derived from the action integral===

Requiring that the true trajectory '''q'''(''t'') be a [[stationary point]] of the action functional &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to a set of differential equations for '''q'''(''t'') (the '''Euler–Lagrange equations'''), which may be derived as follows.

Let '''q'''(''t'') represent the true evolution of the system between two specified states '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = '''q'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''q'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = '''q'''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at two specified times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and let '''ε'''(''t'') be a small perturbation that is zero at the endpoints of the trajectory

:&lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol\varepsilon(t_1) = \boldsymbol\varepsilon(t_2) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  0
&lt;/math&gt;

To first order in the perturbation '''ε'''(''t''), the change in the action functional &lt;math&gt;\delta\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; would be
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta \mathcal{S} = 
\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\;
\left[ L(\mathbf{q}+\boldsymbol\varepsilon,\dot{\mathbf{q}} +\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}})- L(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}}) \right]dt = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\; \left(
\boldsymbol\varepsilon \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} + 
\dot{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}} \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}}  \right)\,dt      
&lt;/math&gt;

where we have expanded the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] ''L'' to first order in the perturbation '''ε'''(''t'').

Applying [[integration by parts]] to the last term results in

:&lt;math&gt;
\delta \mathcal{S} = 
\left[ \boldsymbol\varepsilon \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}}\right]_{t_1}^{t_2} + 
\int_{t_1}^{t_2}\; 
\left( \boldsymbol\varepsilon \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}}
- \boldsymbol\varepsilon \cdot \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right)\,dt
&lt;/math&gt;

The boundary conditions &lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol\varepsilon(t_1) = \boldsymbol\varepsilon(t_2) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  0
&lt;/math&gt; causes the first term to vanish

:&lt;math&gt;\delta \mathcal{S} = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\; \boldsymbol\varepsilon \cdot\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} - \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} \right)\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

Hamilton's principle requires that this first-order change &lt;math&gt;\delta \mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is zero for all possible perturbations '''ε'''(''t''), i.e., the true path is a [[stationary point]] of the action functional &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; (either a minimum, maximum or saddle point).  This requirement can be satisfied if and only if

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|title='''[[Euler–Lagrange equations]]'''
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{q}} - \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\mathbf{q}}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
|border=2
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

These equations are called the Euler–Lagrange equations for the variational problem.

===Canonical momenta and constants of motion===

The '''conjugate momentum''' ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a generalized coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;p_k \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_k}&lt;/math&gt;.

An important special case of the Euler–Lagrange equation occurs when ''L'' does not contain a generalized coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' explicitly,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial L}{\partial q_k}=0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_k} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d p_k}{dt} = 0 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the conjugate momentum is a ''constant of the motion''.

In such cases, the coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is called a '''cyclic coordinate'''.  For example, if we use polar coordinates ''t, r, θ'' to describe the planar motion of a particle, and if ''L'' does not depend on ''θ'', the conjugate momentum is the conserved angular momentum.

===Example: Free particle in polar coordinates===

Trivial examples help to appreciate the use of the action principle via the Euler–Lagrange equations. A free particle (mass ''m'' and velocity ''v'') in Euclidean space moves in a straight line. Using the Euler–Lagrange equations, this can be shown in [[coordinates (elementary mathematics)|polar coordinates]] as follows. In the absence of a potential, the Lagrangian is simply equal to the kinetic energy 
:&lt;math&gt; L = \frac{1}{2} mv^2= \frac{1}{2}m \left( \dot{x}^2 + \dot{y}^2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;
in orthonormal (''x'',''y'') coordinates, where the dot represents differentiation with respect to the curve parameter (usually the time, ''t''). Therefore, upon application of the Euler–Lagrange equations,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow  \qquad m\ddot{x} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

And likewise for ''y''. Thus the Euler–Lagrange formulation can be used to derive Newton's laws.

In polar coordinates (''r'', φ) the kinetic energy and hence the Lagrangian becomes

:&lt;math&gt; L = \frac{1}{2}m \left( \dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\varphi}^2 \right). &lt;/math&gt;

The radial ''r'' and ''φ'' components of the Euler–Lagrange equations become, respectively

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{r}} \right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial r} = 0  \qquad
\Rightarrow  \qquad \ddot{r} -  r\dot{\varphi}^2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\varphi}}  \right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial \varphi} = 0  \qquad
\Rightarrow  \qquad \ddot{\varphi} + \frac{2}{r}\dot{r}\dot{\varphi} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The solution of these two equations is given by

:&lt;math&gt; r = \sqrt{(a t + b)^2 + c^2} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \varphi = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{a t + b}{c} \right) + d &lt;/math&gt;

for a set of constants ''a, b, c, d'' determined by initial conditions.
Thus, indeed, ''the solution is a straight line'' given in polar coordinates: ''a'' is the velocity, ''c'' is the distance of the closest approach to the origin, and ''d'' is the angle of motion.

==Applied to deformable bodies==
Hamilton's principle is an important variational principle in [[Linear elasticity|elastodynamics]]. As opposed to a system composed of rigid bodies, deformable bodies have an infinite number of degrees of freedom and occupy continuous regions of space; consequently, the state of the system is described by using continuous functions of space and time. The extended Hamilton Principle for such bodies is given by

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \left[ \delta W_e + \delta T - \delta U \right]dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the kinetic energy, ''U'' is the elastic energy, ''W&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the work done by
external loads on the body, and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the initial and final times. If the system is conservative, the work done by external forces may be derived from a scalar potential ''V''. In this case,

: &lt;math&gt; \delta \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \left[ T - (U + V) \right]dt = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This is called Hamilton's principle and it is invariant under coordinate transformations.

==Comparison with Maupertuis' principle==

Hamilton's principle and [[Maupertuis' principle]] are occasionally confused and both have been called (incorrectly) the [[principle of least action]].  They differ in three important ways: 
* ''their definition of the [[action (physics)|action]]...'' 
:Maupertuis' principle uses an integral over the [[generalized coordinates]] known as the '''abbreviated action''' or [[reduced action]]
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{0} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int \mathbf{p} \cdot d\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt; 
:where '''p''' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'') are the conjugate momenta defined above.  By contrast, Hamilton's principle uses &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;, the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] over [[time]].

*''the solution that they determine...''
:Hamilton's principle determines the trajectory '''q'''(''t'') as a function of time, whereas Maupertuis' principle determines only the shape of the trajectory in the generalized coordinates.  For example, Maupertuis' principle determines the shape of the ellipse on which a particle moves under the influence of an inverse-square central force such as [[gravitation|gravity]], but does not describe ''per se'' how the particle moves along that trajectory.  (However, this time parameterization may be determined from the trajectory itself in subsequent calculations using the [[conservation of energy]]).  By contrast, Hamilton's principle directly specifies the motion along the ellipse as a function of time.

*''...and the constraints on the variation.''
:Maupertuis' principle requires that the two endpoint states ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be given and that energy be conserved along every trajectory (same energy for each trajectory). This forces the endpoint times to be varied as well. By contrast, Hamilton's principle does not require the conservation of energy, but does require that the endpoint times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be specified as well as the endpoint states ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Action principle for fields==

===Classical field theory===

{{main|Classical field theory}}

The '''action principle''' can be extended to obtain the [[equations of motion]] for [[field (physics)|fields]], such as the [[electromagnetic field]] or [[Einstein–Hilbert action|gravity]].

The [[Einstein equation]] utilizes the ''[[Einstein–Hilbert action]]'' as constrained by a [[variational principle]].

The path of a body in a gravitational field (i.e. free fall in space time, a so-called geodesic) can be found using the action principle.

===Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory===

{{main|Quantum field theory}}

In [[quantum mechanics]], the system does not follow a single path whose action is stationary, but the behavior of the system depends on all imaginable paths and the value of their action. The action corresponding to the various paths is used to calculate the [[Path integral formulation|path integral]], that gives the [[probability amplitude]]s of the various outcomes.

Although equivalent in classical mechanics with [[Newton's laws]], the '''action principle''' is better suited for generalizations and plays an important role in modern physics.  Indeed, this principle is one of the great generalizations in physical science. In particular, it is fully appreciated and best understood within [[quantum mechanics]]. [[Richard Feynman]]'s [[path integral formulation]] of quantum mechanics is based on a stationary-action principle, using path integrals. [[Maxwell's equations]] can be derived as conditions of stationary action.

== Origin ==
The form that used to register a site with the [[Usenet]] [[map]]ping project, before [[Internet]] connectivity became commonplace for Usenet sites, included a field for [[longitude]] and [[latitude]], preferably to [[arcsecond|seconds-of-arc]] accuracy.  This was actually used for generating geographically-correct maps of [[Usenet]] links on a plotter; however, it became traditional to refer to this as one's [[ICBM]] address or missile address, and some people include it in their [[signature block|sig block]] with that name (but a real missile address would include target [[elevation#Geography|elevation]]).

A '''lead time''' is the [[:wikt:latency|latency]] between the initiation and execution of a process. For example, the lead time between the placement of an order and delivery of a new car from a manufacturer may be anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months.

==Journalism==
Lead time in [[publishing]] describes the amount of time that a [[journalist]] has between receiving a writing assignment and submitting the completed piece.  Depending on the publication, lead times can be anything from a couple of hours to many months/years.

==Medicine==
Lead time (when referring to a disease) is the length of time between detection of a disease through screening and the moment in time where it would have normally presented with symptoms and led to a diagnosis. An example of this is seen with breast cancer population screening, where women who are asymptomatic have a positive test result with mammography, whereas the underlying disease would have taken many more years to manifest.

==Supply chain management==
A more conventional definition of lead time in the [[supply chain management]] realm is the time from the moment the customer places an order (the moment the supplier learns of the requirement) to the moment it is ready for delivery. In the absence of [[finished goods]] or intermediate (work in progress) inventory, it is the time it takes to actually manufacture the order without any inventory other than raw materials. The [[Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply]] identifies "total lead time" as a combination of "internal lead time" (the time required for the buying organisation's internal processes to progress from identification of a need to the issue of a [[purchase order]]) and "external lead time" (the time required for the supplying organisation's processes, including any [[New product development|development]] required, manufacture, despatch and delivery).&lt;ref&gt;CIPS in partnership with Profex Publishing, ''Procurement and Supply Operations'', 2012, revised 2016, pp. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing==
In the manufacturing environment, lead time has the same definition as that of Supply Chain Management, but it includes the time required to ship the parts from the supplier.  The shipping time is included because the manufacturing company needs to know when the parts will be available for [[material requirements planning]].  It is also possible for lead time to include the time it takes for a company to process and have the part ready for manufacturing once it has been received.  The time it takes a company to unload a product from a truck, inspect it, and move it into storage is non-trivial.  With tight manufacturing constraints or when a company is using [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] manufacturing it is important for supply chain to know how long their own internal processes take.

Lead time is made of:&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.supply-chain-consultant.eu/10/lead-time-supply-chain/ ''Lead Times'']. "Lead times in supply chain" Supply Chain Consultant Website.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Preprocessing Lead Time''' (also known as "planning time" or "paperwork"): It represents the time required to release a purchase order (if you buy an item) or create a job (if you manufacture an item) from the time you learn of the requirement.
* '''Processing Lead Time''': It is the time required to procure or manufacture an item.
* '''Postprocessing Lead Time''': It represents the time to make a purchased item available in inventory from the time you receive it (including quarantine, inspection, etc.)

'''Example'''

Company A needs a part that can be manufactured in two days once Company B has received an order.  It takes three days for company A to receive the part once shipped, and one additional day before the part is ready to go into manufacturing.
*If Company A's Supply Chain calls Company B they will be quoted a lead time of 2 days for the part.
*If Company A's Manufacturing division asks the Supply Chain division what the lead time is, they will be quoted 5 days since shipping will be included.
*If a line worker asks the Manufacturing Division boss what the lead time is before the part is ready to be used, it will be 6 days because setup time will be included.

'''In more detail'''

Lead Time terminology has been defined in greater detail.&lt;ref&gt;Rajaniemi, J. (2012) [http://www.leadtimes.org/ ''www.leadtimes.org''] Lead Time Terminology in Manufacturing.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supply Chain from customer order received to the moment the order is delivered is divided into five lead times.
* '''Order Lead Time''' - Time from customer order received to customer order delivered.
* '''Order Handling Time''' - Time from customer order received to sales order created.
* '''Manufacturing Lead Time''' - Time from sales order created to production finished (ready for delivery).
* '''Production Lead Time''' - Time from start of physical production of first submodule/part to production finished (ready for delivery).
* '''Delivery Lead Time''' - Time from production finished to customer order delivered.

'''Example '''

A restaurant opens up and a customer walks in. A waiter guides him to a table, gives him the menu and asks what he would like to order. The customer selects a dish and the waiter writes it in his notepad. At that moment the customer has made an order which the restaurant has accepted – Order Lead Time and Order Handling Time have begun. Now the waiter marks the order in the cash register, rips the paper from the notepad, takes it into the kitchen and puts into the order queue. The order has been handled and is waiting in the factory (kitchen) for manufacturing. As there are no other customers, the waiter decides to stand outside the kitchen, by the door, waiting for the dish to be prepared and begins calculating Manufacturing Lead Time.

Meanwhile, the chef finishes what he was doing, takes the order from the queue, starts his clock as a mark for the start of Production Lead Time and begins cooking. The chef chops the vegetables, fries the meat and boils the pasta. When the dish is ready, the chef rings a bell and stops his clock. At the same time the waiter stops calculating Manufacturing Lead Time and rushes through the kitchen door to get the food while it is hot.

When he picks it up, begins counting of Delivery Lead Time that ends when the dish is served to the customer, who can now happily say that the Order Lead Time was shorter than he had expected.

==Order lead time==
When talking about Order Lead Time (OLT) it is important to differentiate the definitions that may exist around this concept. Although they look similar there are differences between them that help the industry to model the order behavior of their customers. The four definitions are : 
*The '''Actual Order Lead Time ''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Actual&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, A. (1989). Component inventory costs in an assembly problem with uncertain supplier lead-times. IIE transactions, 21(2), 112-121.&lt;/ref&gt; The order lead-time'', refers to the time which elapses between the receipt of the customer's order (Order Entry Date) and the  '''''delivery''''' of the goods."&lt;ref&gt;Gunasekaran, A., Patel, C., &amp;  Tirtiroglu, E., 2001  "Performance measures and metrics in a supply chain environment." International journal of operations &amp; production Management 21, no. 1/2: 71-87.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The '''Requested Order Lead Time ''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Requested&lt;/sub&gt;) represents the time between the Order Entry Date and the customer '''''requested''''' delivery date; this measurement could help the company to understand the order behavior of the customers and help to design profitable models to fulfill customer needs.&lt;ref&gt;2)Cousens, A., Szwejczewski, M., &amp; Sweeney, M. 2009. "A process for managing manufacturing flexibility." International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management, 29(4), pp.357-385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Silva, L., 2013, "Supply Chain Contract Compliance Measurements" Master thesis (work in progress), Aalto University, Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''Quote Order Lead Time ''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Quote&lt;/sub&gt;) is the '''''agreed'' ''' time between the Order Entry Date and the supplier’s committed deliver date of goods as stipulated in a supply chain contract.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;
*The '''Confirmed Order Lead Time''' (OLT&lt;sub&gt;Confirmed&lt;/sub&gt;) represents the time between the Order Entry Date and the by the supplier '''''confirmed''''' delivery date of goods.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

[[Image:OLT Definitions.jpg|thumb|OLT Definitions&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;]]

=== OLT formulas ===
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Requested&lt;/sub&gt; = Wish Date – Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Requested&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the date the customer wants the material in his facilities (wish date) and the date when they provided its order to the supplier. 
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Quote&lt;/sub&gt; = Quote Date – Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Quote&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the date the customer agree to receive the material in their facilities (Quote date) and the date when the order is provided to the supplier.
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Actual&lt;/sub&gt; = Delivery Date – Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Actual&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the day the provider deliver the material (Delivery date) and the date when they enter the order in the system. 
*OLT&lt;sub&gt;Confirmed&lt;/sub&gt; = Confirmed Date – Order Entry Date
The OLT&lt;sub&gt;Confirmed&lt;/sub&gt; will be determined by the difference between the date the confirmed date by the provider to deliver the material in the customer facilities (Confirmed date) and the date when they provide the order to the supplier.

===Average OLT based on volume===
The Average OLT based on Volume (OLT&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;) is the addition of all the multiplications between the volume of product we deliver (quantity) and the OLT divided by the total quantity delivered in the period of time we are studying for that specific facility.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;OLTV= \frac{\sum_{j}{Quantity_j \cdot OLT_j}}{_{Total Quantity Deliver}} \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
By doing this the company will be able to find a relation of volume weighted between the quantities of material required for an order and the time requested to accomplish it. The volume metric could be applied to the 4 types of OLT. &lt;br /&gt;
The figure obtained from this calculation will be the average time (e.g. in days) between order placing and the requested delivery date of a specific customer under consideration of the average quantities ordered during that particular time.

===Potential application areas for order lead time measurement===
The correct analysis of OLT will give the company:
*Better understanding of the market behavior making it able to develop more profitable schemas that fit better with customer needs (Revenue Management).
*Increases company ability to detect and correct any behavior that is not within terms agreed in the contract (by penalization or different contract schema).  
*The OLT measurement creates an opportunity area to improve the customer relations by increasing the level of communication with them.

==Project management==
In [[project management]] lead time is the time it takes to complete a task or a set of interdependent tasks. The lead of the entire [[project]] would be the overall duration of the [[critical path method|critical path]] for the project.

Lead time is also the saved time by starting an activity before its predecessor is completed.

According to the PMI (2008), lead is a dependency between two activities (p.&amp;nbsp;140).&lt;ref&gt;PMI. (2008). A guide to a project management body of knowledge (4th. ed.). ''The Project Management Institute''. Newton Square, PA: PMI Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be scheduling the start of a 2-week activity dependent with the finish of the successor activity with a lead of 2 weeks so they will finish at the same time.

M. Bernstein, ''A Basic Theory of Neuropsychoanalysis'' (2011)  p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; this [[Complex (psychology)|psychological complex]] is said to develop in men who see women as either saintly [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Madonna]]s or debased [[prostitute]]s.

The term is also used popularly, if sometimes with subtly different meanings.

==Causes==
Freud argued that the Madonna–whore complex was caused by a split between the affectionate and the sexual currents in male desire.&lt;ref name="Sigmund Freud p. 251"&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7)  p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] and [[castration anxiety]] fears prohibit the affection felt for past incestuous objects from being attached to women who are sensually desired: "The whole sphere of love in such persons remains divided in the two directions personified in art as sacred and profane (or animal) love".&lt;ref name="Sigmund Freud p. 251"/&gt;  In order to minimize anxiety, the man categorizes women into two groups: women he can admire and women he finds sexually attractive. Whereas the man loves women in the former category, he despises and devalues the latter group.&lt;ref name="tuch"&gt;Tuch, Richard (2010). "Murder on the Mind: Tyrannical Power and Other Points along the Perverse Spectrum". ''[[The International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'' '''91''' (1): 141-162. {{doi|10.1111/j.1745-8315.2009.00220.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychoanalyst Richard Tuch suggests that Freud offered at least one alternative explanation for the Madonna–whore complex: &lt;blockquote&gt;This earlier theory is based not on oedipal-based castration anxiety but on man's primary [[Misogyny|hatred of women]], stimulated by the child's sense that he had been made to experience intolerable frustration and/or narcissistic injury at the hands of his [[mother]]. According to this theory, in adulthood the boy-turned-man seeks to avenge these mistreatments through [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] attacks on women who are stand-ins for mother.&lt;ref name="tuch"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is possible that such a split may be exacerbated when the sufferer is raised by a cold but overprotective mother&lt;ref&gt;P. A Sacco, ''Madonna Complex'' (2011) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; – a lack of emotional nurturing paradoxically strengthening an incestuous tie.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism'' (1993) p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Such a man will often court someone with maternal qualities, hoping to fulfill a need for maternal [[intimacy]] unmet in [[childhood]], only for a return of the repressed feelings surrounding the earlier relationship to prevent sexual satisfaction in the new.&lt;ref name="Sigmund Freud p. 251"/&gt;

Another theory claims that the Madonna–whore complex derives from the representations of women as either madonnas or whores in mythology and Judeo-Christian theology rather than developmental disabilities of individual men.&lt;ref name="feinman"&gt;Feinman, Clarice. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hpt7bVYB-fUC&amp;pg=PA3 ''Women in the criminal justice system'']. Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 1994, pp. 3&amp;ndash;4, {{ISBN|978-0-275-94486-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual politics==
[[Naomi Wolf]] considered that the [[sexual revolution]] had paradoxically intensified the importance of the virgin–whore split, leaving women to contend with the worst aspects of both images.&lt;ref&gt;Naomi Wolf, ''Promiscuities'' (1997) p. 5 and p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Others consider that both men and women find integrating sensuality and an ideal femininity difficult to do within the same relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly/Marion Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (1999) p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2017}}
*[[Alfred Hitchcock]] used the Madonna–whore dichotomy as an important mode of representing women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gay |first1= Volney P. |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Joy and the Objects of Psychoanalysis: Literature, Belief, and Neurosis |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QVoxmNrnRooC&amp;pg=PA109 |series= SUNY series in psychoanalysis and culture |year= 2001 |publisher= State University of New York Press |location= Albany |isbn= 978-0-7914-5099-4 |page= 109 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), for example, [[Kim Novak]] portrays two women that the hero cannot reconcile: a virtuous, blonde, sophisticated, sexually repressed "madonna" and a dark-haired, single, sensual "fallen woman".&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Paul. [https://books.google.com/books?id=UMEMCvyZ54EC&amp;pg=PA90 ''Dial "M" for Mother: A Freudian Hitchcock''].  Madison, N.J.: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2008, pp. 89&amp;ndash;91, {{ISBN|978-0-8386-4133-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Martin Scorsese]] films, ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[Raging Bull]]'', feature sexually obsessed protagonists, both played by [[Robert De Niro]], who exhibit the Madonna–whore complex with the women they interact with.
*In ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum]]'', set in a mental asylum during the 1960s, a time when the field of psychoanalysis was in chaos, the repressed character Dr. Arthur Arden, as portrayed by [[James Cromwell]], is fixated on a seemingly innocent and virtuous nun. When she later sexually propositions him, he bitterly defaces and then destroys a statue of the Virgin Mary (a.k.a. the Madonna), screaming "Whore!" at it accusingly. Earlier in the series, Arden had shown to subscribe to Freudian theory regarding feminine sexuality.
*Pamela Thurschwell highlighted "the range of [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]]'s women, which may often begin with a fine line in madonnas and whores but which often go on to undercut each other in spectacular reversals".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in N. Corcoran ed., ''Do You, Mr Jones?'' (2002) p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;
*In ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', women are strictly categorised and forced to wear a uniform of a specified colour, representative of their status as "Madonna" or "whore". The handmaids, who are disrespected and violated continually, are made to wear red, which is associated with sex and fertility; the protagonist, a Handmaid named June, is objectified and abused by Fred. In contrast, the wives wear blue which is reminiscent of the virgin Mary; Serena, Fred's wife, doesn't get the attention she wants from her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ScreenPrism|title=The Handmaid's Tale is About the Present|date=2018-05-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R45eiu8SXko|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mitzvah Day International''' is an annual day of faith-based social action that takes place in November each year, primarily in the [[United Kingdom]]. On Mitzvah Day each year, community groups and individuals undertake a range of [[Volunteering|volunteer]] projects for those in need in their local community. Organizations register with Mitzvah Day, which in turn helps match volunteers with local projects. The objective is to encourage people to give their time, rather than their money, to worthwhile local causes, whilst also creating deeper linkages within communities and supporting charities. In 2013, close to 30,000 people participated in Mitzvah Day around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2013-11-19 |title=In Pictures: Mitzvah Day 2013 |url=http://jewishnews.co.uk/in-pictures-mitzvah-day-2013/ |newspaper=Hendon &amp; Finchley Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Though based within the [[British Jews|UK's Jewish Community]], Mitzvah Day traditionally marks the first day of UK National Inter Faith Week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interfaithweek.org/index.php/events/events/extended-list-test?viewid=16&amp;vmode=d&amp;date=2013-11-17 |title=UK Inter Faith Week: Events for Sunday, November 17, 2013 |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=2013-11-17 |website=Inter Faith Week |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result has expanded to include participants from other faith communities as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Slater |first=Anna |date=2013-11-15 |title=Interfaith Mitzvah Day project in Whetstone |url=http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/10812704.Interfaith_Mitzvah_Day_project/ |newspaper=Hendon &amp; Finchley Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Halkon |first=Ruth |date=2013-11-06 |title=Mitzvah Day and National Interfaith Week events in Aldenham and Radlett |url=http://www.borehamwoodtimes.co.uk/news/10790049.Gathering_together_to_make_the_community_better/ |newspaper=Borehamwood &amp; Elstree Times |location= |publisher=Times Series |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
'[[Mitzvah]]' is the Hebrew biblical term for 'deed' or '[[613 mitzvot|commandment]]', which has come to mean 'good deed' or 'charitable act' in contemporary [[English Language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mitzvah |title=Mitzvah: definition |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Miriam Webster Dictionary |publisher= |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 date is November 19.&lt;ref&gt;http://mitzvahday.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Mitzvah Day International was founded by Laura Marks in 2005, who, upon returning to her native UK from a period spent in [[Los Angeles]], decided to bring the 'Mitzvah Day' concept she became familiar with through the [[Temple Israel of Hollywood]] [[synagogue]] back to the UK. Though the Mitzvah Day she was familiar with (and most Mitzvah Days in the US) was based around a single community or [[Synagogue|congregation]], her concept for Mitzvah Day in the UK was to unite Jewish community and other groups around a single coordinated day of social action across the country.

'''Multitude''' is a term for a group of people who cannot be classed under any other distinct category, except for their shared fact of existence. The term has a history of use reaching back to antiquity, but took on a strictly political concept when it was first used by [[Machiavelli]] and reiterated by [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]. The multitude is a concept of a population that has not entered into a social contract with a sovereign political body, such that individuals retain the capacity for political self-determination. A multitude typically classified as a quantity exceeding 100. For [[Hobbes]] the multitude was a rabble that needed to enact a [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|social contract]] with a monarch, thus turning them from a multitude into a people. For Machiavelli and Spinoza both, the role of the multitude vacillates between admiration and contempt. Recently the term has returned to prominence as a new model of resistance against global systems of power as described by political theorists [[Michael Hardt]] and [[Antonio Negri]] in their international best-seller [[Empire (Negri and Hardt book)|''Empire'']] (2000) and expanded upon in their ''[[Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire]]'' (2004). Other theorists recently began to use the term include political thinkers associated with [[Autonomist Marxism]] and its sequelae, including [[Sylvère Lotringer]], [[Paolo Virno]], and thinkers connected with the eponymous review ''[[Multitudes]]''.

==History==
The concept originates in Machiavelli’s ''[[Discourses on Livy|Discorsi]]''. It is, however, with [[Hobbes]]'s recasting of the concept as the war-disposed, dissolute pole of the opposition between a Multitude and a People in ''[[De Cive]]'', that Spinoza’s conceptualization seems, according to Negri, contrasted.&lt;ref&gt;Negri, ''The Savage Anomaly'', pp. 109, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The multitude is used as a term and implied as a concept throughout Spinoza's work. In the ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]'', for instance, he acknowledges that the (fear of
the) power (potentia) of the multitude is the limit of sovereign power (potestas): ‘Every ruler has
more to fear from his own citizens […] than from any foreign enemy, and it is this “fear of the
masses” […that is] the principal brake on the power of the sovereign or state.’ The explication of
this tacit concept, however, only comes in Spinoza's last and unfinished work known as the ''[[Political Treatise]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;It must next be observed, that in laying foundations it is very necessary to study the human passions: and it is not enough to have shown, what ought to be done, but it ought, above all, to be shown how it can be effected, that men, whether led by passion or reason, should yet keep the laws firm and unbroken. For if the constitution of the dominion, or the public liberty depends only on the weak assistance of the laws, not only will the citizens have no security for its maintenance […], but it will even turn to their ruin. […] And, therefore, it would be far better for the subjects to transfer their rights absolutely to one man, than to bargain for unascertained and empty, that is unmeaning, terms of liberty, and so prepare for their posterity a way to the most cruel servitude. But if I succeed in showing that the foundation of monarchical dominion […], are firm and cannot be plucked up, without the indignation of the larger part of an armed multitude, and that from them follow peace and security for king and multitude, and if I deduce this from general human nature, no one will be able to doubt, that these foundations are the best and the true ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The concept of the multitude resolves the tension that scholars have observed in Spinoza’s
political project between the insistence on the benign function of sovereignty (as witnessed in the
quotation above) and the insistence on individual freedom. It is, we see here, a truly
revolutionary concept, and it is not difficult to see why Spinoza’s contemporaries (and, as for instance [[Étienne Balibar]] has implied, even Spinoza himself {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}) saw it as a dangerous political idea.

==Reiteration by Negri and Hardt==
Negri describes the multitude in his ''The Savage Anomaly'' as an unmediated, [[revolutionary]], immanent, and positive collective social subject which can found a ‘nonmystified’ form of democracy (p.&amp;nbsp;194). In his more recent writings with [[Michael Hardt]], however, he does not so much offer a direct definition, but presents the concept through a series of mediations. In [[Empire (Negri and Hardt book)|''Empire'']] it is mediated by the concept of Empire (the new global constitution that Negri and Hardt describe as a copy of [[Polybius]]'s description of Roman government):

&lt;blockquote&gt;New figures of struggle and new subjectivities are produced in the conjecture of events, in the universal nomadism […] They are not posed merely against the imperial system—they are not simply negative forces. They also express, nourish, and develop positively their own constituent projects. […] This constituent aspect of the movement of the multitude, in its myriad faces, is really the positive terrain of the historical construction of Empire, […] an antagonistic and creative positivity. The deterritorializing power of the multitude is the productive force that sustains Empire and at the same time the force that calls for and makes necessary its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

They remain however vague &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; as to this 'positive' or 'constituent' aspect of the Multitude:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Certainly, there must be a moment when reappropriation [of wealth from capital] and selforganization [of the multitude] reach a threshold and configure a real event. This is when the political is really affirmed—when the genesis is complete and self-valorization, the cooperative convergence of subjects, and the proletarian management of production become a constituent power. […] We do not have any models to offer for this event. Only the multitude through its practical experimentation will offer the models and determine when and how the possible becomes real.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| page = 411
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their sequel ''[[Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire]]'' they still refrain from a clear definition of the concept but approach the concept through mediation of a host of ‘contemporary’ phenomena, most importantly the new type of postmodern war they postulate and the history of post-WWII resistance movements. It remains a rather vague concept which is assigned a revolutionary potential without much theoretical substantiation apart from a generic potential of love.

Sylvère Lotringer has criticized Negri and Hardt's use of the concept for its ostensible return to the dialectical dualism in the introduction to Paulo Virno's ''A Grammar of the Multitude'' (see external links).

'''New Atheism''' is a term coined in 2006 by the [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] journalist [[Gary Wolf (journalist)|Gary Wolf]] to describe the positions promoted by some [[History of atheism#Twenty-first century|atheists of the twenty-first century]].&lt;ref&gt;Lois Lee &amp; Stephen Bullivant, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XguDDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT48 A Dictionary of Atheism]'' (Oxford University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/atheism.html?pg=1&amp;topic=atheism&amp;topic_set= Wolff, Gary, in ''The New Atheism'', The Church of the Non-Believers reprinted in Wired Magazine, November 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; This modern-day [[atheism]] is advanced by a group of thinkers and writers who advocate the view that [[superstition]], [[religion]] and [[irrationalism]] should not simply be tolerated but should be [[Antireligion|countered]], [[Criticism of religion|criticized]], and exposed by rational argument wherever their influence arises in government, education, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/n-atheis/|title=New Atheists|website=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=14 April 2016|quote=The New Atheists are authors of early twenty-first century books promoting atheism.

New Atheism lends itself to and often overlaps with [[secular humanism]] and [[antitheism]], particularly in its criticism of what many New Atheists regard as the [[indoctrination]] of children and the perpetuation of [[ideologies]] founded on belief in the supernatural. Some critics of the movement characterise it pejoratively as "militant atheism" or "fundamentalist atheism".{{efn|The term is sometimes used benignly, for example by atheists such as Frans de Waal.&lt;ref name=DeWaal/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=DeWaal&gt;{{cite web |last1=De Waal |first1=Frans |authorlink1=Frans de Waal|title=Has militant atheism become a religion? |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/03/25/militant_atheism_has_become_a_religion/ |publisher=Salon.com |accessdate=9 March 2017 |date=25 March 2013 |quote=Why are the 'neo-atheists' of today so obsessed with God's nonexistence that they go on media rampages, wear T-shirts proclaiming their absence of belief, or call for a militant atheism?

==History==
===Early history===

The Harvard botanist [[Asa Gray]], a believing Christian and one of the first supporters of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]], commented in 1868 that the more worldly Darwinists in England had "the English-materialistic-positivistic line of thought".&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Janet The ''Power of Place'', Volume 2 of the Biography of Charles Darwin (Alfred Knopf, 2002), page 310&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin's supporter [[Thomas Huxley]] was openly skeptical, as the biographer Janet Browne describes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Huxley was rampaging on miracles and the existence of the soul. A few months later, he was to coin the word "agnostic" to describe his own position as neither a believer nor a disbeliever, but one who considered himself free to inquire rationally into the basis of knowledge, a philosopher of pure reason [...] The term fitted him well [...] and it caught the attention of the other free thinking, rational doubters in Huxley's ambit, and came to signify a particularly active form of scientific rationalism during the final decades of the 19th century. [...] In his hands, agnosticism became as doctrinaire as anything else--a religion of skepticism. Huxley used it as a creed that would place him on a higher moral plane than even bishops and archbishops. All the evidence would nevertheless suggest that Huxley was sincere in his rejection of the charge of outright atheism against himself. He refused to be "a liar". To inquire rigorously into the spiritual domain, he asserted, was a more elevated undertaking than slavishly to believe or disbelieve. "A deep sense of religion is compatible with the entire absence of theology," he had told [Anglican clergyman] Charles Kingsley back in 1860. "Pope Huxley", the [magazine] ''Spectator'' dubbed him. The label stuck." —Janet Browne&lt;ref&gt;Browne, Janet ''The Power of Place'', Volume 2 of the Biography of Charles Darwin (Alfred Knopf, 2002), pages 309-310&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Recent history===

The 2004 publication of ''[[The End of Faith|The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason]]'' by [[Sam Harris]], a bestseller in the United States, was joined over the next couple years by a series of popular best-sellers by atheist authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/09/hitchens200709|title=God Bless Me, It's a Best-Seller!|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|website=Vanity Fair|access-date=14 April 2016|quote=...in the last two years there have been five atheist best-sellers, one each from Professors Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennett and two from the neuroscientist Sam Harris.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris was motivated by the events of [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], which he laid directly at the feet of Islam, while also directly criticizing [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Sam |authorlink=Sam Harris |date=11 August 2004 |title=The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason |publisher=[[W.

In a 2010 column entitled "Why I Don't Believe in the New Atheism", [[Tom Flynn (author)|Tom Flynn]] contends that what has been called "New Atheism" is neither a movement nor new, and that what was new was the publication of atheist material by big-name publishers, read by millions, and appearing on bestseller lists.&lt;ref name="Flynn2010"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Flynn | first = Tom | authorlink = Thomas W.

On 30 September 2007, four prominent atheists ([[Richard Dawkins]], [[Sam Harris]], [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Daniel Dennett]]) met at Hitchens' residence in Washington, D.C., for a private two-hour unmoderated discussion. The event was videotaped and titled "The Four Horsemen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://richarddawkins.net/2013/10/the-four-horsemen-dvd-19-95/ |title=The Four Horsemen DVD |website=Richard Dawkins Foundation |language=en-US |access-date=13 April 2016 |quote=On the 30th of September 2007, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens sat down for a first-of-its-kind, unmoderated 2-hour discussion, convened by RDFRS and filmed by Josh Timonen.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During "The God Debate" in 2010 featuring Christopher Hitchens versus [[Dinesh D'Souza]], the men were collectively referred to as the "Four Horsemen of the Non-Apocalypse",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/sam-harris-is-still-railing-against-religion/ |title=Sam Harris is Still Railing Against Religion |last=Hoffman|first=Claire|date=2 September 2014 |website=Los Angeles Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=13 April 2016|quote=As Western society grappled with radical Islam, Harris distinguished himself with his argument that modern religious tolerance had placated us into allowing delusion rather than reason to prevail.

[[Sam Harris]] is the author of the bestselling non-fiction books ''[[The End of Faith]]'', ''[[Letter to a Christian Nation]]'', ''[[The Moral Landscape]]'', and ''[[Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion]]'', as well as two shorter works, initially published as e-books, ''Free Will''&lt;ref name="Free Will"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris |first=Sam|authorlink=Sam Harris (author)|year=2012|title=Free Will|publisher=The Free Press |isbn=978-1451683400|page=96 |id= {{ASIN|1451683405|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Lying''.&lt;ref name=Lying&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris |first=Sam|title=Lying|year=2013|publisher=Four Elephants Press|isbn=978-1940051000|page=108|id= {{ASIN|1940051002|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris is a co-founder of the Reason Project.

[[Richard Dawkins]] is the author of ''[[The God Delusion]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins |first=Richard |title=The God Delusion|year=2007|publisher=Black Swan|isbn=978-0-552-77429-1|title-link=The God Delusion }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was preceded by a [[Channel 4]] television documentary titled ''[[The Root of All Evil?]]''. He is the founder of the [[Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science]]. He wrote: "I don't object to the horseman label, by the way. I'm less keen on 'new atheist': it isn't clear to me how we differ from old atheists."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], ''[[The God Delusion]]'', 10th anniversary edition, Black Swan, 2016, page I15 (new introduction for the 10th anniversary edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]] was the author of ''[[God Is Not Great]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Hitchens |title=God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything |year=2007 |publisher=Atlantic Books |edition=First trade |isbn=978-1-843-54574-3 |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named among the "Top 100 Public Intellectuals" by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' and ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' magazines. In addition, Hitchens served on the advisory board of the [[Secular Coalition for America]]. In 2010 Hitchens published his memoir ''[[Hitch-22]]'' (a nickname provided by close personal friend [[Salman Rushdie]], whom Hitchens always supported during and following [[The Satanic Verses controversy|''The Satanic Verses'' controversy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Hitch22 |year=2010 |publisher=Atlantic Books |isbn=978-1-843-54922-2 |page=448 |id= {{ASIN|1843549220|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after its publication, Hitchens was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, which led to his death in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christopher Hitchens dies at 62 after suffering cancer|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16212418 |publisher=BBC News|date=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before his death, Hitchens published a collection of essays and articles in his book ''Arguably'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|title=Arguably|year=2011|publisher=Atlantic Books|isbn=978-0857892584|id= {{ASIN|0857892584|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; a short edition ''Mortality''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher |title=Mortality |year=2012 |publisher=Atlantic Books|isbn=978-1848879218|id= {{ASIN|1848879210|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; was published posthumously in 2012. These publications and numerous public appearances provided Hitchens with a platform to remain an astute atheist during his illness, even speaking specifically on the culture of [[deathbed conversion]]s and condemning attempts to convert the [[terminally ill]], which he opposed as "bad taste".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Is there an afterlife? |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbzd6ZbCowY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Hitchens and Paxman interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-s9AyNQyCw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Hitchens, [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] (who attended the 2012 [[Global Atheist Convention]], which Hitchens was scheduled to attend) was referred to as the "plus one horse-woman", since she was originally invited to the 2007 meeting of the "Horsemen" atheists but had to cancel at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=sOMjEJ3JO5Q|title=Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris &amp; Ayaan Hirsi Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hirsi Ali was born in [[Mogadishu]], [[Somalia]], fleeing in 1992 to the [[Netherlands]] in order to escape an [[arranged marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali|url=http://www.project-reason.org/about/individual_member/2663/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became involved in Dutch politics, rejected faith, and became vocal in opposing Islamic ideology, especially concerning women, as exemplified by her books ''Infidel'' and ''The Caged Virgin''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirsi Ali|first=Ayaan |authorlink=Ayaan Hirsi Ali|title=The Caged Virgin|year=2008 |isbn=978-0743288347 |id= {{ASIN|0743288343|country=uk}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hirsi Ali was later involved in the production of the film ''[[Submission (2004 film)|Submission]]'', for which her friend [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo Van Gogh]] was murdered with a death threat to Hirsi Ali pinned to his chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Controversial film maker killed|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/controversial-filmmaker-shot-dead-531777.html | location=London | work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event resulted in Hirsi Ali's hiding and later immigration to the United States, where she now resides and remains a prolific critic of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirsi Ali|first=Ayaan|title=Christians in the Muslim world |url=http://mag.newsweek.com/2012/02/05/ayaan-hirsi-ali-the-global-war-on-christians-in-the-muslim-world.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She regularly speaks out against the treatment of women in Islamic doctrine and society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirsi Ali |first=Ayaan|title=Ayaan Hirsi Ali on Protecting Women From Militant Islam |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/Ayaan-Hirsi-Ali-on-Protecting-Women-From-Militant-Islam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a proponent of free speech and the freedom to offend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirsi Ali|first=Ayaan|title=The Right to Offend|url=http://www.project-reason.org/archive/item/the_right_to_offend_a_speech_by_ayaan_hirsi_ali/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirsi Ali|first=Ayaan|title=Muslim Rage and the Last Gasp of Islamic Hate|url=http://mag.newsweek.com/2012/09/16/ayaan-hirsi-ali-on-the-islamists-final-stand.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspective==
Many contemporary atheists write from a scientific perspective. Unlike previous writers, many of whom thought that science was indifferent or even incapable of dealing with the "[[God]]" concept, Dawkins argues to the contrary, claiming the "God Hypothesis" is a valid [[hypothesis|scientific hypothesis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Richard | last = Dawkins | title = The God Delusion | location = Boston | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; having effects in the physical universe, and like any other hypothesis can be tested and [[falsifiability|falsified]]. The late [[Victor Stenger]] proposed that the personal [[Abrahamic religions#The Supreme Deity|Abrahamic God]] is a scientific hypothesis that can be tested by standard methods of science. Both Dawkins and Stenger conclude that the hypothesis fails any such tests,&lt;ref&gt;Stenger, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and argue that [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] is sufficient to explain everything we observe in the universe, from the most distant galaxies to the [[abiogenesis|origin of life]], the existence of different species, and the inner workings of the brain and [[consciousness]]. Nowhere, they argue, is it necessary to introduce God or the [[supernatural]] to understand reality. New Atheists reject [[Jesus]]' divinity.&lt;ref name=Jr.2008&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Albert Mohler Jr.|title=Atheism Remix: A Christian Confronts the New Atheists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IaaM4GEDD0MC&amp;pg=PA56|date=25 July 2008|publisher=Crossway|isbn=978-1-4335-2262-8|pages=56–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific testing of religion===
Non-believers assert that many religious or supernatural claims (such as the [[virgin birth of Jesus]] and the [[afterlife]]) are scientific claims in nature. They argue, as do [[deists]] and [[Progressive Christianity|Progressive Christians]], for instance, that the issue of Jesus' supposed parentage is not a question of "values" or "morals" but a question of scientific inquiry.&lt;ref name=freeinquiry&gt;{{cite journal| first = Richard | last = Dawkins | url = http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&amp;page=dawkins_18_2 | title = When Religion Steps on Science's Turf : The Alleged Separation Between the Two Is Not So Tidy | journal = Free Inquiry Magazine | volume = 18 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rational thinkers believe science is capable of investigating at least some, if not all, supernatural claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Yonatan | last = Fishman | url = http://www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/Yon/test_supernatural2007.pdf | title = Can Science Test Supernatural Worldviews? }}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions such as the [[Mayo Clinic]] and [[Duke University]] are attempting to find [[empiricism|empirical]] support for the [[Studies on intercessory prayer|healing power of intercessory prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mukto-mona.com/Special_Event_/Darwin_day/supernatural_science300106.htm | title = Supernatural Science | first = Victor J. | last = Stenger | authorlink=Victor J Stenger | publisher = mukto-mona }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stenger, these experiments have thus far found no evidence that intercessory [[prayer]] works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stenger|first=Victor J.|title=The new atheism : taking a stand for science and reason|date=2009|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=[[Amherst, New York]]|isbn=978-1-59102-751-5|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logical arguments===
Stenger also argues in his book, ''[[God: The Failed Hypothesis]]'', that a God having [[Omniscience|omniscient]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] and [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] attributes, which he termed a ''3O God'', cannot [[logic]]ally exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stenger|first=Victor J.|title=God : the failed hypothesis : how science shows that God does not exist|date=2007|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst (New York)|isbn=978-1-59102-481-1|edition=[Nachdr.]|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar series of logical disproofs of the existence of a God with various attributes can be found in [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] and Ricki Monnier's ''[[The Impossibility of God]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink1 = Michael Martin (philosopher) | first1 = Michael | last1 = Martin | authorlink2 = Ricki Monnier | first2 = Ricki | last2 = Monnier | title = The Impossibility of God | publisher = Prometheus Books | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Theodore M.

===Views on non-overlapping magisteria===
Richard Dawkins has been particularly critical of the conciliatory view that science and religion are not in conflict, noting, for example, that the Abrahamic religions constantly deal in scientific matters.  In a 1998 article published in ''Free Inquiry'' magazine&lt;ref name=freeinquiry /&gt; and later in his 2006 book ''The God Delusion'', Dawkins expresses disagreement with the view advocated by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] that science and religion are two [[non-overlapping magisteria]] (NOMA), each existing in a "domain where one form of teaching holds the appropriate tools for meaningful discourse and resolution". In Gould's proposal, science and religion should be confined to distinct non-overlapping domains: science would be limited to the empirical realm, including theories developed to describe observations, while religion would deal with questions of ultimate meaning and [[morality|moral value]]. Dawkins contends that NOMA does not describe empirical facts about the intersection of science and religion: "It is completely unrealistic to claim, as Gould and many others do, that religion keeps itself away from science's turf, restricting itself to morals and values. A universe with a supernatural presence would be a fundamentally and qualitatively different kind of universe from one without. The difference is, inescapably, a scientific difference. Religions make existence claims, and this means scientific claims."

===Science and morality===
{{main|Science of morality}}
Popularized by Sam Harris is the view that science and thereby currently unknown objective facts may instruct human morality in a globally comparable way. Harris' book ''The Moral Landscape''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Sam|title=The Moral Landscape|year=2012|publisher=Black Swan|isbn=978-0552776387|id= {{ASIN|0552776386|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accompanying TED Talk ''How Science can Determine Moral Values''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Sam|title=How Science can Determine Moral Values|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; propose that human well-being and conversely suffering may be thought of as a landscape with peaks and valleys representing numerous ways to achieve extremes in human experience, and that there are objective states of well-being.

===Politics===
New Atheism is politically engaged in a variety of ways. These include campaigns to draw attention to the biased privileged position religion has and to reduce the influence of religion in the public sphere, attempts to promote cultural change (centering, in the United States, on the mainstream acceptance of atheism), and efforts to promote the idea of an "atheist identity". Internal strategic divisions over these issues have also been notable, as are questions about the diversity of the movement in terms of its gender and racial balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kettell | first = Steven | url = http://www.secularismandnonreligion.org/article/view/snr.al/12 | title = Faithless: The Politics of New Atheism | journal = [[Secularism and Non Religion]] | volume = 2 | pages = 61–78 | year = 2013|doi=10.5334/snr.al}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
===Accusations of Evangelicalism and Fundamentalism===
The theologians Jeffrey Robbins and Christopher Rodkey take issue with what they regard as "the [[Evangelism|evangelical]] nature of the New Atheism, which assumes that it has a Good News to share, at all cost, for the ultimate future of humanity by the conversion of as many people as possible." They believe they have found similarities between New Atheism and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christianity]] and conclude that the all-consuming nature of both "encourages endless conflict without progress" between both extremities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffrey Robbins and Christopher Rodkey|title=Religion and the New Atheism A Critical Appraisal.|year=2010|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=9781608462032|page=35|editor=Amarnath Amarasingam|chapter=Beating 'God' to Death: Radical Theology and the New Atheism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist William Stahl said, "What is striking about the current debate is the frequency with which the New Atheists are portrayed as mirror images of religious [[fundamentalist]]s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=William Stahl|title=Religion and the New Atheism A Critical Appraisal.|year=2010|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=9781608462032|pages=97–108|editor=Amarnath Amarasingam|chapter=One-Dimensional Rage: The Social Epistemology of the New Atheism and Fundamentalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The atheist [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Michael Ruse]] has made the claim that Richard Dawkins would fail "introductory" courses on the study of "[[philosophy]] or [[religion]]" (such as courses on the [[philosophy of religion]]), courses which are offered, for example, at many educational institutions such as colleges and universities around the world.&lt;ref name=DoughertyGage&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dougherty, T|author2=Gage, LP|editor1-last=Oppy|editor1-first=Graham|title=The Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon and New York|isbn=9781844658312|pages=52–53|chapter=4/ New Atheist Approaches to Religion, pp. 51-62|quote=Michael Ruse (2009) claimed that Dawkins would fail 'any philosophy or religion course'; and for this reason Ruse says The God Delusion made him 'ashamed to be an atheist'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RuseBiologosBeliefnet&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruse|first1=Michael|title=Why I Think the New Atheists are a Bloody Disaster|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/scienceandthesacred/2009/08/why-i-think-the-new-atheists-are-a-bloody-disaster.html|website=Beliefnet|publisher=The BioLogos Foundation as a columnist of Beliefnet|accessdate=19 August 2015|date=August 2009|quote=… the new atheists do the side of science a grave disservice … these people do a disservice to scholarship ... Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion would fail any introductory philosophy or religion course. Proudly he criticizes that whereof he knows nothing … the poor quality of the argumentation in Dawkins, Dennett, Hitchens, and all of the others in that group … the new atheists are doing terrible political damage to the cause of Creationism fighting. Americans are religious people ... They want to be science-friendly, although it is certainly true that many have been seduced by the Creationists. We evolutionists have got to speak to these people. We have got to show them that Darwinism is their friend not their enemy We have got to get them onside when it comes to science in the classroom. And criticizing good men like Francis Collins, accusing them of fanaticism, is just not going to do the job. Nor is criticizing everyone, like me, who wants to build a bridge to believers – not accepting the beliefs, but willing to respect someone who does have them … The God Delusion makes me ashamed to be an atheist …  They are a bloody disaster …}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruse also claims that the movement of New Atheism—which is perceived, by him, to be a "bloody disaster"—makes him ashamed, as a professional philosopher of science, to be among those holding to an atheist position, particularly as New Atheism does science a "grave disservice" and does a "disservice to scholarship" at more general level.&lt;ref name=DoughertyGage /&gt;&lt;ref name=RuseBiologosBeliefnet /&gt;

[[Paul Kurtz]], editor in chief of [[Free Inquiry]], founder of [[Prometheus Books]], was critical of many of the new atheists.&lt;ref name="Kurtz kurtz_27_2"/&gt; He said, "I consider them atheist fundamentalists... They're anti-religious, and they're mean-spirited, unfortunately. Now, they're very good atheists and very dedicated people who do not believe in God. But you have this aggressive and militant phase of atheism, and that does more damage than good".&lt;ref name="A Bitter Rift Divides Atheists"/&gt;

[[Jonathan Sacks]], author of ''The Great Partnership: Science, Religion, and the Search for Meaning'', feels the new atheists miss the target by believing the "cure for bad religion is no religion, as opposed to good religion". He wrote: 
{{quote|Atheism deserves better than the new atheists whose methodology consists of criticizing religion without understanding it, quoting texts without contexts, taking exceptions as the rule, confusing folk belief with reflective theology, abusing, mocking, ridiculing, caricaturing, and demonizing religious faith and holding it responsible for the great crimes against humanity. Religion has done harm; I acknowledge that. But the cure for bad religion is good religion, not no religion, just as the cure for bad science is good science, not the abandonment of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sacks |first1=Jonathan |title=The Great Partnership: Science, Religion, and the Search for Meaning |date=2011 |publisher=Schocken |location=New York |isbn=978-0-805-24301-7 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Political biases===
The philosopher [[Massimo Pigliucci]] contends that the new atheist movement overlaps with [[scientism]], which he finds to be philosophically unsound. He writes: "What I do object to is the tendency, found among many New Atheists, to expand the definition of science to pretty much encompassing anything that deals with 'facts', loosely conceived..., it seems clear to me that most of the New Atheists (except for the professional philosophers among them) pontificate about philosophy very likely without having read a single professional paper in that field.... I would actually go so far as to charge many of the leaders of the New Atheism movement (and, by implication, a good number of their followers) with anti-intellectualism, one mark of which is a lack of respect for the proper significance, value, and methods of another field of intellectual endeavor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pigliucci|first1=Massimo|title=New Atheism and the Scientistic Turn in the Atheism Movement|date=2013|publisher=Midwest Studies in Philosophy|pages=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atheist professor [[Jacques Berlinerblau]] has criticised the New Atheists' mocking of religion as being inimical to their goals and claims that they haven't achieved anything politically.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/professor-jacques-berlinerblau-tells-atheists-stop-whining/2012/09/14/0fdaf7f4-feab-11e1-98c6-ec0a0a93f8eb_story.html Professor Jacques Berlinerblau tells atheists: Stop whining!

The term ''Ojha''' or ''Oza'' is a Hindu Brahmin caste that has settled in north and central India and are found in the states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and some parts of Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. {{cn|date=July 2018}}

Ojha is a surname for Hindu Sikhwal Brahmins, [[Shrimali Brahmins]], Atri Gotra Brahmin, [[Saraswat Brahmin]], [[Bhumihar Brahmin]]s, Kanya Kubj Brahmin, Saryuparin Brahmin, [[Maithil Brahmin]] of [[Nepal]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Nagar Brahmin]], and [[Bengali Brahmin]] of [[India]] and [[Nepal]]{{cn|date=July 2018}}. Ojhas are considered to be worshipers of [[Durga]], [[Saraswati]], [[Hanuman]], [[Mahalakshmi]] and  Shiva {{cn|date=July 2018}}. The surname is used amongst speakers of [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Bhojpuri]], [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Kumaoni language|Kumaoni]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] as well as the [[Santhals]]{{cn|date=July 2018}}. The high population of Ojhas are found in [[Nepal|Central Nepal]], and Rajasthan in India within the districts of [[Gonda district|Gonda]], [[Gorakhpur district|Gorakhpur]], Pithoragarh, Uttarakhand, [[Pratapgarh district, Uttar Pradesh|Pratapgarh]], [[Ballia district|Ballia]], [[Buxar district|Buxar]] ([[Bihar]]), and [[Arrah|Ara]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The term Ojha is derived from [[Sanskrit]]. Literal translations vary, but one meaning is "he who is doing meditation for whole life". According to some, the Ojhas were the top class Brahmin preachers who earned their livelihood through teaching. In Rajasthan, some consider Sharma and Ojha to be the same clan. The Jhas are Maithilis originated in Bihar and [[Nepal]] in [[Janakpur]]a and call their sons-in-laws Ojhajis. This has given credence to this belief. {{cn|date=July 2018}}

Ojhas are basically divided into two parts – Ojha and the ''Bavan-gaon ke Ojhas'' (the Ojhas of the 52 villages), as they got 52 villages in charity from one of [Rajasthan]-region rulers for having protected those rulers by fighting themselves {{cn|date=July 2018}}. They were also given the title of 'Sharma' for the valour and aggression with which they fought. Mata [[Kaalratri Mata , Bharmani Mata]] is the ''Kuldevi'' of the Bavan-gaon ke Ojhas. Some Ojhas in [[Rajasthan]] have become ''Bhumihars'', and usually use Saraswa or Sharma as their surnames. Some although have not become Bhumihars but still have the title of Singh – to use it or not to use is individual choice. {{cn|date=July 2018}}

Ojha Brahmin from Rajasthan had excellence in Martial Art, Spirituality, Veda and Science. They have many sub-branches under the surname Ojha. A sub- branch is known as Khairi Ojha which played a significant role in Indian history. Kairi Ojha are active in shaping and binding Hindu rituals and knowledge before the Shankaracharya and formation of “ Four Mathh” Sathapna. Khairi Ojha were spiritual leader for uttar Pradesh and Bihar region. They perform as “Rajguru”, “Army Trainer”, “Thinker” and Philosopher. In few parts of India Ojha ware ruling the Riyasats. {{cn|date=July 2018}}

The Ojha of [[Rajasthan]] Brahmins are mainly [[vegetarians]].

As [[Brahmins]], the Ojhas are spiritual leaders, teachers, and members of the highest ritual rank in the [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] system of [[Hinduism]]. {{cn|date=July 2018}}

Most of the Ojhas are concentrated in the Rajasthan Gujarat (India) and Nepal, a few in Mauritius and can also be found in many regions of India and all over world. {{cn|date=July 2018}}

==People==
Notable people with surname '''Ojha''' Include:
*[[Krittibas Ojha]], medieval Bengali poet &amp; writer who translated the Ramayan into Bengali.
*[[Om Prasad Ojha]], Nepalese politician
*[[Puskar Nath Ojha]], Nepalese politician

'''Oppositional gaze''' is a political rebellion and resistance against the repression of black people's right to a [[gaze]]; and it is through these looking relations that independent black cinema develops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminism and Visual Cultural Reader.|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=Amelia Jones|year=1992|isbn=9780415543705|location=New York: Routledge, 2003|pages=94–105|chapter=The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectator|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''oppositional gaze'' was coined by feminist, scholar and social activist [[bell hooks]] in 1992. It is a work of [[feminist film theory]], which criticizes the [[male gaze]] through [[Michel Foucault]]'s 'relations of power'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; hooks asserts "there is power in looking".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The oppositional gaze encompasses modes of looking and looking back&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which employ reflexive gazes such as:  
* The shared gaze&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* The repressed gaze&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* White supremacist capitalist imperialist dominating gaze&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Phallocentric gaze&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Black male gaze&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Interrogation gazes&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* Gaze of Recognition&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
The concept was first developed as a critique of the [[male gaze]] by [[bell hooks]] in her essay "The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectators".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  hooks posits the power of the [[gaze]] from a black body as repressed, denied, and ultimately interrogating.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through critical discussion around black women and cinema, the oppositional gaze enters as the counterpart to reinforcing white supremacy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Subsequently, black films developed in response to the stagnant stereotypes of white-dominated cinema. It is critical to note that even in this realm, the concerns around gender relations reinforce an imaginative moment of [[Phallocentrism|phallocentric]] power by black men, a power not disseminated toward black women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] theory, modes of power and looking relations are contextualized within the [[mirror stage]]. This stage subsequently produces the narcissistic [[libido]] and the alienating function of the 'I' "...which will mark with its rigid structure the subject's entire mental development. Thus, to break out of the circle of the ''Innenwelt'' into the ''Umwelt'' generates the inexhaustible quadrature of the ego's verifications".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Critical and Cultural Theory Reader|last=Easthope|first=Antony, and Kate McGowan|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=Maidenhead: Open UP, 2004|pages=71–80|chapter=Jacques Lacan from 'The Mirror Stage' (1949)|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, hook's first encounter with Sapphire from [[Amos 'n' Andy]] "...explored both the negation of black female representation in cinema and television and our rejection of these images. [Sapphire's] black female image was not the body of desire. There was nothing to see. She was not us".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lacan examines this dual relationship, noting that the [[mirror stage]] is "...far from a phenomenon that occurs in the development of the child".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lacan.com/seminars1.htm|title=Jacques Lacan - the seminars of Jacques Lacan|website=lacan.com|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, placing the black female spectator in a paradigm of ''méconnaissances'', where their image was explained and reiterated without them looking. As hooks concludes on the black characterization of Sapphire, "How could we long to be there when our image, visually constructed, was so ugly".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Black female spectatorship ==
In "The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectators",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; hooks gives the rubric that black woman are not only underrepresented in film, but they are also not allowed to 'look' either.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://womenandmediafa2012.blogspot.ca/2012/09/the-male-gaze-and-oppositional-gaze.html|title=The Male Gaze and the Oppositional Gaze|website=womenandmediafa2012.blogspot.ca|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking implores a sense of power that is removed from the black female body, to play the role of object in direct relation to white female existence.

In 2015, [[Viola Davis]] was quoted by [[Entertainment Weekly]] saying, "[[Toni Morrison]] said that as soon as a character of color is introduced in a story imagination stops…I mean, I’m a black woman from Central Falls, Rhode Island. I’m [[Dark skin|dark-skinned]]. I’m quirky. I’m shy. I’m strong. I’m guarded. I’m weak at times. I’m sensual. I’m not overtly sexual. I am so many things in so many ways, and I will never see myself on screen”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://the-toast.net/2015/09/29/anatomy-of-a-black-actress-viola-davis/|title=Anatomy of a Black Actress: Viola Davis|last=Sylla|first=Fanta|date=2015-09-29|website=The Toast|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is beneath this very umbrella that hooks' concept of the oppositional gaze is present, as [[Viola Davis|Davis]], a decorated actress and producer, states the realities of what it means to be a black woman in film. This statement came after [[Viola Davis|Davis]] was awarded as the first black woman to win the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]].

== Male gaze ==
"‘The Oppositional Gaze’&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; by bell hooks is the rejection of [[Laura Mulvey]]’s paper, ''Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema'' (1975)".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media and Cultural Studies: Keywords|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|publisher=Meenakshi Gigi Durham and Douglas Kellner|year=|isbn=|location=2001; Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2006|pages=342–352|chapter=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema.|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jennylovespeach.wordpress.com/2012/11/17/the-oppositional-gaze/|title=The Oppositional Gaze|last=jennylovespeach|date=2012-11-17|website=jennylovespeach|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulvey's text analyses Lacan's [[mirror stage]] within film, concluding that [[subjectivity]] is "the birth of the long love affair/ despair between image and self-image which has found such intensity of expression in film and such joyous recognition in the cinema audience".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She furthers this point by criticizing the "male movie star's glamorous characteristics" as not subject to an objectifying gaze, but rather a more powerful stance as the '[[Ego ideal|ideal ego]]' developed in the beginning stages of recognition in front of the mirror.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mulvey defines the "split between active/ male and passive/ female" as the pleasure in looking through which the determining [[male gaze]] stylizes the female figure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Bell hooks|hooks]] rebuts this claim stating, "Black female spectators 'actively' chose not to identify with the film's imaginary subject because such identification was disenabling".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The concept of seeing one's self in opposition to the '[[Ego ideal|ideal ego]]' must begin with recognition of one's body as comparably different. Black female representation in film exists primarily in opposition to the white woman's body. Thus, black women often remain in search of a [[mirror stage]] because they metaphorically have yet to see true representations of themselves. [[Bell hooks|hooks]] gives an example of this rare recognition through two characters in the film "Passion of Remembrance". She writes, "Dressing to go to a party, Louise and Maggie claim the '[[gaze]]'. Looking at one another, staring in mirrors, they appear completely focused on their encounter with black femaleness".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mulvey's criticisms present exclusionary perspectives which inundate the white female body as a totalizing categorization of all women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Not only is the representation of Black women significantly marginalized within film but they are further misrepresented as stereotyped objects to which the [[male gaze]] is rarely, if ever applied. This concept leads [[Bell hooks|hooks]] to ask, "Are we really to imagine that feminist theorists writing only about images of white women... do not 'see' the whiteness of the image?".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The oppositional gaze serves as "a gesture of resistance" to not only the male gaze but also toward the oppression of minorities through cinema by the all-inclusive [[gendering]] of woman. This gaze criticizes the doubling effect of objectification by "turning away [as] one way to protest, to reject negation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Feminine gaze ==
[[Judith Butler]] theorizes the feminine gaze as "a pervasive heterosexism in feminist theory".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Undoing Gender|last=Butler|first=Judith|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=New York: Routledge, 2004|pages=204–231|chapter=The Question of Social Transformation.|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay "The Question of Social Transformation",&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Butler states, "Through performativity, dominant and nondominant gender norms are equalized. But some of those performative accomplishments claim the place of nature or claim the place of symbolic necessity...".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These theories criticize the male gaze and its objectification of 'women' as it predominantly excludes more than just the Black oppositional gaze but further problematizes the [[subjectivity]] of gendering male verses female. Furthermore, 'woman' as [[heterogenous]] sex object functions for and within the patriarchy, reinforcing "white supremacist capitalist imperialist dominating '[[gaze]]'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Olympia's Maid ==
The surrounding controversy of [[Édouard Manet]]'s [[Olympia (Manet)|''Olympia'']] (1863) highlights the confrontational gaze as defiant and critical within the context of its time. However, there is a second gaze within this painting that is "cooperating with the West's construction of not-white women as not-to-be-seen".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader|last=O'Grady|first=Lorraine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=174–187|chapter=Olympia's Maid: Reclaiming Black Female Subjectivity|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]], pegged as a prostitute, makes direct eye contact with viewers while her 'black servant' "looms in the shadows" as background.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In her essay titled, "Olympia's Maid: Reclaiming Black Female Subjectivity",&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Lorraine O'Grady]] states, "...only the white body remains as the object of a voyeuristic, fetishizing [[male gaze]]. The not-white body has been made opaque by a blank stare...".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

This "blank stare" through a body of [[alterity]] reiterates bell hooks definition of the oppositional gaze. The deliberate characterization of the 'black servant' is ideologically rooted in the constructs of black female identity as [[Mammy archetype|Mammy]], [[Jezebel]], and Sapphire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Carolyn M|date=2008-01-01|title=Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire and their homegirls: Developing an "oppositional gaze" toward the images of Black women|url=https://works.bepress.com/DrCarolynWest/15/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Lorraine O'Grady|O'Grady]] declares, "Forget euphemisms. Forget 'tonal contrast'. We know what she is meant for: she is Jezebel and Mammy, [[Prostitution|prostitute]] and [[The Female Eunuch|female eunuch]], the two-in-one".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Olympia's maid serves not only as the maid but as the opposing body of difference to whiteness; both visually and sexually. Within [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] theory, [[people of color]] are "symbolically and even theoretically excluded from sexual difference".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Olympia, although defiant as gazing prostitute, remains as a unitary sign of the female body in the West. "It has an obverse and a reverse".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As hooks says, "…[this] image functions solely to reaffirm and reinscribe patriarchy".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These comparative power relations conjure up opposing forces that transfer agency from one side to the 'other'. Michel Foucault insists that there is the possibility of resistance to domination and therefore an oppositional gaze exists. While Olympia confronts the male gaze, her maid confronts the repressed gaze, the oppositional gaze, and the gaze of recognition.

'''Parading on a donkey''' is a traditional [[psychological punishment]], consisting in a [[public humiliation]].

==Scope==

* In [[rural]] areas of [[India]], it is intended to humiliate those guilty of minor [[crime]]s, and usually meted out by village elders or the local [[panchayat]] system of justice. The guilty person's head is often shaved and a garland of used [[footwear]] hung around their neck before they are paraded around the village or town on a [[donkey]] while mocked by onlookers. 10th century inscriptions from [[Uttaramerur]] indicate that parading on donkey was a punishment for offences such as [[incest]], [[adultery]], [[theft]] and [[forgery]].&lt;ref name="VKA_2010"&gt;{{cite book |title=Indian History |editor=VK Agnihotri |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MazdaWXQFuQC&amp;pg=SL2-PA62 |publisher=Allied |isbn=978-81-8424-568-4 |year=2010 |edition=26th |pages=B–62–B–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], "Iranian authorities frequently parade youths, forced to sit backwards on donkeys, in their local neighbourhood so as to embarrass and humiliate them ... for petty crimes such as alcohol consumption, disregarding nightly curfews and disrespect towards security agents",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpun.com/irj00511.htm "Iran sentences three youth to flogging, jail"], in: ''Iran Focus'', 21 November 2005 (illustrated)&lt;/ref&gt; or if the court orders so through several neighbourhoods; this may be a prelude to subsequent [[flogging]] and/or jail terms; in the Western [[Ancien Régime]] tradition too (long continued, even in former colonies), criminals were often transported publicly to the place of their ordeal.
* In post-Renaissance [[France]] society ridiculed and humiliated husbands thought to be battered and/or dominated by their wives. A battered husband was trotted around town riding a donkey backwards while holding its tail.
* According to the Christian [[Gospels]], [[Jesus of Nazareth entered Jerusalem]] on [[Palm Sunday]] riding a donkey and being welcomed with palms by the locals, thus fulfilling a [[Biblical prophecy]]. In this case, the donkey parade was not a punishment but a messianic action in a modest variation as a symbol of meekness.
* The [[Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus']] used to parade on a donkey across [[Red Square]] on [[Palm Sunday]].
* In the movie ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' the defeated Christian king [[Guy of Lusignan]] is paraded before Jerusalem on a donkey by the Muslim army commanded by [[Saladin]].

{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Formulations}}
The '''path integral formulation''' of [[quantum mechanics]] is a description of quantum theory that generalizes the [[action (physics)|action principle]] of [[classical mechanics]].  It replaces the classical notion of a single, unique classical trajectory for a system with a sum, or [[functional integral]], over an infinity of quantum-mechanically possible trajectories to compute a [[probability amplitude|quantum amplitude]].

This formulation has proven crucial to the subsequent development of [[theoretical physics]], because manifest [[Lorentz covariance]] (time and space components of quantities enter equations in the same way) is easier to achieve than in the operator formalism of [[canonical quantization]]. Unlike previous methods, the path integral allows a physicist to easily change [[coordinates]] between very different [[canonical coordinates|canonical]] descriptions of the same quantum system. Another advantage is that it is in practice easier to guess the correct form of the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] of a theory, which naturally enters the path integrals (for interactions of a certain type, these are ''coordinate space'' or ''Feynman path integrals''), than the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]. Possible downsides of the approach include that [[unitarity]] (this is related to conservation of probability; the probabilities of all physically possible outcomes must add up to one) of the [[S-matrix]] is obscure in the formulation. The path-integral approach has been proved to be equivalent to the other formalisms of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Thus, by ''deriving'' either approach from the other, problems associated with one or the other approach (as exemplified by Lorentz covariance or unitarity) go away.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002|loc=Chapter 9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The path integral also relates quantum and [[stochastic]] processes, and this provided the basis for the grand synthesis of the 1970s, which unified [[quantum field theory]] with the [[statistical mechanics|statistical field theory]] of a fluctuating field near a [[second-order phase transition]]. The [[Schrödinger equation]] is a [[diffusion equation]] with an imaginary diffusion constant, and the path integral is an [[analytic continuation]] of a method for summing up all possible [[random walk]]s.

The basic idea of the path integral formulation can be traced back to [[Norbert Wiener]], who introduced the [[Wiener integral]] for solving problems in diffusion and [[Brownian motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chaichian|Demichev|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was extended to the use of the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] in quantum mechanics by [[P. A. M. Dirac]] in his 1933 article.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dirac|1933}}&lt;br&gt;PDF:[http://www.hep.anl.gov/czachos/soysoy/Dirac33.pdf The Lagrangian in Quantum Mechanics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Vleck|1928}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete method was developed in 1948 by [[Richard Feynman]]. Some preliminaries were worked out earlier in his doctoral work under the supervision of [[John Archibald Wheeler]]. The original motivation stemmed from the desire to obtain a quantum-mechanical formulation for the [[Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory]] using a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] (rather than a [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]) as a starting point.

[[File:Three paths from A to B.png|thumbnail|250px|These are just three of the paths that contribute to the quantum amplitude for a particle moving from point A at some time {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} to point B at some other time {{math|''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.]]

== Quantum action principle ==

In quantum mechanics, as in classical mechanics, the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is the generator of time translations. This means that the state at a slightly later time differs from the state at the current time by the result of acting with the Hamiltonian operator (multiplied by the negative [[imaginary unit]], {{math|−''i''}}). For states with a definite energy, this is a statement of the [[de Broglie relation]] between frequency and energy, and the general relation is consistent with that plus the [[superposition principle]].

The Hamiltonian in classical mechanics is derived from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]], which is a more fundamental quantity relative to [[special relativity]]. The Hamiltonian indicates how to march forward in time, but the time is different in different [[Frame of reference|reference frames]]. The Lagrangian is a [[Lorentz scalar]], while the Hamiltonian is the time component of a [[four-vector]]. So the Hamiltonian is different in different frames, and this type of symmetry is not apparent in the original formulation of quantum mechanics.

The Hamiltonian is a function of the position and momentum at one time, and it determines the position and momentum a little later. The Lagrangian is a function of the position now and the position a little later (or, equivalently for infinitesimal time separations, it is a function of the position and velocity). The relation between the two is by a [[Legendre transformation]], and the condition that determines the classical equations of motion (the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s) is that the [[action (physics)|action]] has an extremum.

In quantum mechanics, the Legendre transform is hard to interpret, because the motion is not over a definite trajectory. In classical mechanics, with [[discretization]] in time, the Legendre transform becomes

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon H = p(t)\big(q(t + \varepsilon) - q(t)\big) - \varepsilon L&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; p = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}},&lt;/math&gt;

where the partial derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;\dot q&lt;/math&gt; holds {{math|''q''(''t'' + ''ε'')}} fixed. The inverse Legendre transform is

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon L = \varepsilon p \dot{q} - \varepsilon H,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \dot q = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p},&lt;/math&gt;

and the partial derivative now is with respect to {{mvar|p}} at fixed {{mvar|q}}.

In quantum mechanics, the state is a [[quantum superposition|superposition of different states]] with different values of {{mvar|q}}, or different values of {{mvar|p}}, and the quantities {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} can be interpreted as noncommuting operators. The operator {{mvar|p}} is only definite on states that are indefinite with respect to {{mvar|q}}. So consider two states separated in time and act with the operator corresponding to the Lagrangian:

:&lt;math&gt; e^{i\big[p \big(q(t + \varepsilon) - q(t)\big) - \varepsilon H(p, q) \big]}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the multiplications implicit in this formula are reinterpreted as ''matrix'' multiplications, the first factor is

:&lt;math&gt; e^{-ip q(t)},&lt;/math&gt;

and if this is also interpreted as a matrix multiplication, the sum over all states integrates over all {{math|''q''(''t'')}}, and so it takes the [[Fourier transform]] in {{math|''q''(''t'')}} to change basis to {{math|''p''(''t'')}}. That is the action on the Hilbert space – '''change basis to {{mvar|p}} at time {{mvar|t}}'''.

Next comes

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-i\varepsilon H(p,q)},&lt;/math&gt;

or '''evolve an infinitesimal time into the future'''.

Finally, the last factor in this interpretation is

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i p q(t + \varepsilon)},&lt;/math&gt;

which means '''change basis back to {{mvar|q}} at a later time'''.

This is not very different from just ordinary time evolution: the {{mvar|H}} factor contains all the dynamical information – it pushes the state forward in time. The first part and the last part are just Fourier transforms to change to a pure {{mvar|q}} basis from an intermediate {{mvar|p}} basis.
{{quote box|align=right|width=42em|quote=...we see that the integrand in (11) must be of the form {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''iF''/''h''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{mvar|F}} is a function of {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which remains finite as {{mvar|h}} tends to zero. Let us now picture one of the intermediate {{mvar|q}}s, say {{mvar|q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}}, as varying continuously while the other ones are fixed. Owing to the smallness of {{mvar|h}}, we shall then in general have ''F''/''h'' varying extremely rapidly. This means that {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''iF''/''h''&lt;/sup&gt;}} will vary periodically with a very high frequency about the value zero, as a result of which its integral will be practically zero. The only important part in the domain of integration of {{mvar|q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} is thus that for which a comparatively large variation in {{mvar|q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} produces only a very small variation in {{mvar|F}}. This part is the neighbourhood of a point for which {{mvar|F}} is stationary with respect to small variations in {{mvar|q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}}. We can apply this argument to each of the variables of integration ... and obtain the result that the only important part in the domain of integration is that for which {{mvar|F}} is stationary for small variations in all intermediate {{mvar|q}}s. ... We see that {{mvar|F}} has for its classical analogue {{math|{{intmath|int|''T''|''t''}} ''L dt''}}, which is just the action function, which classical mechanics requires to be stationary for small variations in all the intermediate {{mvar|q}}s. This shows the way in which equation (11) goes over into classical results when {{mvar|h}} becomes extremely small. |source=Dirac (1933), p. 69}}

Another way of saying this is that since the Hamiltonian is naturally a function of {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}}, exponentiating this quantity and changing basis from {{mvar|p}} to {{mvar|q}} at each step allows the matrix element of {{mvar|H}} to be expressed as a simple function along each path. This function is the quantum analog of the classical action. This observation is due to [[Paul Dirac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dirac|1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dirac further noted that one could square the time-evolution operator in the {{mvar|S}} representation:

:&lt;math&gt; e^{i\varepsilon S},&lt;/math&gt;

and this gives the time-evolution operator between time {{mvar|t}} and time {{math|''t'' + 2''ε''}}. While in the {{mvar|H}} representation the quantity that is being summed over the intermediate states is an obscure matrix element, in the {{mvar|S}} representation it is reinterpreted as a quantity associated to the path. In the limit that one takes a large power of this operator, one reconstructs the full quantum evolution between two states, the early one with a fixed value of {{math|''q''(0)}} and the later one with a fixed value of {{math|''q''(''t'')}}. The result is a sum over paths with a phase, which is the quantum action. Crucially, Dirac identified in this article the deep quantum-mechanical reason for the [[principle of least action]] controlling the classical limit (see quotation box).

== Feynman's interpretation ==

Dirac's work did not provide a precise prescription to calculate the sum over paths, and he did not show that one could recover the Schrödinger equation or the [[canonical commutation relation]]s from this rule. This was done by Feynman.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Both noted that in the limit of action that is large compared to the reduced [[Planck's constant]] {{mvar|ħ}} (using [[natural units]], {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} 1}}), or the classical limit, the path integral is dominated by solutions which are in the neighborhood of [[stationary point]]s of the action.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the classical path arises naturally in the classical limit.

Feynman showed that Dirac's quantum action was, for most cases of interest, simply equal to the classical action, appropriately discretized. This means that the classical action is the phase acquired by quantum evolution between two fixed endpoints. He proposed to recover all of quantum mechanics from the following postulates:
# The [[probability]] for an event is given by the squared modulus of a complex number called the "probability amplitude".
# The [[probability amplitude]] is given by adding together the contributions of all paths in configuration space.
# The contribution of a path is proportional to {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''iS''/''ħ''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{mvar|S}} is the [[Action (physics)|action]] given by the [[time integral]] of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] along the path.

In order to find the overall probability amplitude for a given process, then, one adds up, or [[integral|integrates]], the amplitude of the 3rd postulate over the space of ''all'' possible paths of the system in between the initial and final states, including those that are absurd by classical standards. In calculating the probability amplitude for a single particle to go from one space-time coordinate to another, it is correct to include paths in which the particle describes elaborate [[curlicues]], curves in which the particle shoots off into outer space and flies back again, and so forth. The '''path integral''' assigns to all these amplitudes ''equal weight'' but varying [[phase (waves)|phase]], or argument of the [[complex number]]. Contributions from paths wildly different from the classical trajectory may be suppressed by [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] (see below).

Feynman showed that this formulation of quantum mechanics is equivalent to the [[Quantization (physics)|canonical approach to quantum mechanics]] when the Hamiltonian is at most quadratic in the momentum.  An amplitude computed according to Feynman's principles will also obey the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] corresponding to the given action.

The path integral formulation of quantum field theory represents the [[transition amplitude]] (corresponding to the classical [[correlation function]]) as a weighted sum of all possible histories of the system from the initial to the final state. A [[Feynman diagram]] is a graphical representation of a [[perturbative]] contribution to the transition amplitude.

== Path integral in quantum mechanics ==

=== Time-slicing derivation ===
{{main|Relation between Schrödinger%27s equation and the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics}}
One common approach to deriving the path integral formula is to divide the time interval into small pieces. Once this is done, the [[Lie product formula|Trotter product formula]] tells us that the noncommutativity of the kinetic and potential energy operators can be ignored.

For a particle in a smooth potential, the path integral is approximated by [[zigzag]] paths, which in one dimension is a product of ordinary integrals. For the motion of the particle from position {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} at time {{mvar|t&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}} at time {{mvar|t&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the time sequence
:&lt;math&gt;t_a = t_0 &lt; t_1 &lt; \cdots &lt; t_{n-1} &lt; t_n &lt; t_{n+1} = t_b&lt;/math&gt;
can be divided up into {{math|''n'' + 1}} smaller segments {{math|''t&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''j'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{math|''j'' {{=}} 1, ..., ''n'' + 1}}, of fixed duration
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \Delta t = \frac{t_b - t_a}{n + 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This process is called ''time-slicing''.

An approximation for the path integral can be computed as proportional to

:&lt;math&gt;\int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \cdots \int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty}
 \exp \left(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{t_a}^{t_b} L\big(x(t), v(t)\big) \,dt\right) \,dx_0 \, \cdots \, dx_n, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''L''(''x'', ''v'')}} is the Lagrangian of the one-dimensional system with position variable {{math|''x''(''t'')}} and velocity {{math|''v'' {{=}} ''ẋ''(''t'')}} considered (see below), and {{mvar|dx&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}} corresponds to the position at the {{mvar|j}}th time step, if the time integral is approximated by a sum of {{mvar|n}} terms.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For a simplified, step-by-step derivation of the above relation, see [http://www.quantumfieldtheory.info/website_Chap18.pdf Path Integrals in Quantum Theories: A Pedagogic 1st Step].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the limit {{mvar|''n'' → ∞}}, this becomes a [[functional integral]], which, apart from a nonessential factor, is directly the product of the probability amplitudes {{math|{{bra-ket|''x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''t&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''|''x&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''t&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''}}}} (more precisely, since one must work with a continuous spectrum, the respective densities) to find the quantum mechanical particle at {{mvar|t&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the initial state {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} and at {{mvar|t&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}} in the final state {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Actually {{mvar|L}} is the classical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] of the one-dimensional system considered,
:&lt;math&gt; L(x, \dot x) = T-V=\frac{1}{2}m|\dot{x}|^2-V(x)&lt;/math&gt;
and the abovementioned "zigzagging" corresponds to the appearance of the terms

:&lt;math&gt;\exp\left(\frac{i}{\hbar}\varepsilon \sum_{j=1}^{n+1} L \left(\tilde x_j, \frac{x_j - x_{j-1}}{\varepsilon}, j \right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

in the [[Riemann sum]] approximating the time integral, which are finally integrated over {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{mvar|x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}} with the integration measure {{math|''dx''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''dx&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{mvar|x̃&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an arbitrary value of the interval corresponding to {{mvar|j}}, e.g. its center, {{math|{{sfrac|''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''−1&lt;/sub&gt;|2}}}}.

Thus, in contrast to classical mechanics, not only does the stationary path contribute, but actually all virtual paths between the initial and the final point also contribute.

===Path integral formula===

In terms of the wave function in the position representation, the path integral formula reads as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x,t)=\frac{1}{Z}\int_{\mathbf{x}(0)=x}\mathcal{D}\mathbf{x}\, e^{iS[\mathbf{x},\dot{\mathbf{x}}]}\psi_0(\mathbf{x}(t))\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; denotes integration over all paths &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(0)=x&lt;/math&gt; and where &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is a normalization factor. Here &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the action, given by
:&lt;math&gt;S[\mathbf{x},\dot\mathbf{x}]=\int dt\, L(\mathbf{x}(t),\dot\mathbf{x}(t))&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Path integral example.webm|thumb|The diagram shows the contribution to the path integral of a free particle for a set of paths.]]

=== Free particle ===

The path integral representation gives the quantum amplitude to go from point {{mvar|x}} to point {{mvar|y}} as an integral over all paths. For a free-particle action (for simplicity let {{math|''m'' {{=}} 1}}, {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} 1}})
:&lt;math&gt;S = \int \frac{\dot{x}^2}{2}\, dt,&lt;/math&gt;

the integral can be evaluated explicitly.

To do this, it is convenient to start without the factor {{mvar|i}} in the exponential, so that large deviations are suppressed by small numbers, not by cancelling oscillatory contributions:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y; T) = \int_{x(0) = x}^{x(T) = y} \exp\left(-\int_0^T \frac{\dot{x}^2}{2} \,dt\right) \,Dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Splitting the integral into time slices:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x, y; T) = \int_{x(0) = x}^{x(T) = y} \prod_t \exp\left(-\tfrac12 \left(\frac{x(t + \varepsilon) - x(t)}{\varepsilon}\right)^2 \varepsilon \right) \,Dx,&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{mvar|Dx}} is interpreted as a finite collection of integrations at each integer multiple of {{mvar|ε}}. Each factor in the product is a Gaussian as a function of {{math|''x''(''t'' + ''ε'')}} centered at {{math|''x''(''t'')}} with variance {{mvar|ε}}. The multiple integrals are a repeated [[convolution]] of this Gaussian {{mvar|G&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;}} with copies of itself at adjacent times:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y; T) = G_\varepsilon * G_\varepsilon * \cdots * G_\varepsilon,&lt;/math&gt;

where the number of convolutions is {{math|{{sfrac|''T''|''ε''}}}}. The result is easy to evaluate by taking the Fourier transform of both sides, so that the convolutions become multiplications:
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{K}(p; T) = \tilde{G}_\varepsilon(p)^{T/\varepsilon}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Fourier transform of the Gaussian {{mvar|G}} is another Gaussian of reciprocal variance:

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{G}_\varepsilon(p) = e^{-\frac{\varepsilon p^2}{2}},&lt;/math&gt;

and the result is
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{K}(p; T) = e^{-\frac{T p^2}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Fourier transform gives {{mvar|K}}, and it is a Gaussian again with reciprocal variance:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y; T) \propto e^{ -\frac{(x - y)^2}{2T}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The proportionality constant is not really determined by the time-slicing approach, only the ratio of values for different endpoint choices is determined. The proportionality constant should be chosen to ensure that between each two time slices the time evolution is quantum-mechanically unitary, but a more illuminating way to fix the normalization is to consider the path integral as a description of a stochastic process.

The result has a probability interpretation. The sum over all paths of the exponential factor can be seen as the sum over each path of the probability of selecting that path. The probability is the product over each segment of the probability of selecting that segment, so that each segment is probabilistically independently chosen. The fact that the answer is a Gaussian spreading linearly in time is the [[central limit theorem]], which can be interpreted as the first historical evaluation of a statistical path integral.

The probability interpretation gives a natural normalization choice. The path integral should be defined so that
:&lt;math&gt;\int K(x - y; T) \,dy = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

This condition normalizes the Gaussian and produces a kernel that obeys the diffusion equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} K(x; T) = \frac{\nabla^2}{2} K.&lt;/math&gt;

For oscillatory path integrals, ones with an {{mvar|i}} in the numerator, the time slicing produces convolved Gaussians, just as before. Now, however, the convolution product is marginally singular, since it requires careful limits to evaluate the oscillating integrals. To make the factors well defined, the easiest way is to add a small imaginary part to the time increment {{mvar|ε}}. This is closely related to [[Wick rotation]]. Then the same convolution argument as before gives the propagation kernel:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y; T) \propto e^\frac{i(x - y)^2}{2T},&lt;/math&gt;

which, with the same normalization as before (not the sum-squares normalization – this function has a divergent norm), obeys a free Schrödinger equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} K(x; T) = i \frac{\nabla^2}{2} K.&lt;/math&gt;

This means that any superposition of {{mvar|K}}s will also obey the same equation, by linearity. Defining
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_t(y) = \int \psi_0(x) K(x - y; t) \,dx = \int \psi_0(x) \int_{x(0) = x}^{x(t) = y} e^{iS} \,Dx,&lt;/math&gt;

then {{mvar|ψ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}} obeys the free Schrödinger equation just as {{mvar|K}} does:
:&lt;math&gt;i\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi_t = -\frac{\nabla^2}{2} \psi_t.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Simple harmonic oscillator ===
The Lagrangian for the simple harmonic oscillator is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \tfrac12 m \dot{x}^2 - \tfrac12 m \omega^2 x^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Write its trajectory {{math|''x''(''t'')}} as the classical trajectory plus some perturbation, {{math|''x''(''t'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') + ''δx''(''t'')}} and the action as {{math|''S'' {{=}} ''S''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; + ''δS''}}. The classical trajectory can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;x_\text{c}(t) = x_i \frac{\sin\omega(t_f - t)}{\sin\omega(t_f - t_i)} + x_f \frac{\sin\omega(t - t_i)}{\sin\omega(t_f - t_i)}.&lt;/math&gt;


This trajectory yields the classical action
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
S_\text{c} &amp; = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} \mathcal{L} \,dt = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} \left(\tfrac12 m\dot{x}^2 - \tfrac12 m\omega^2 x^2 \right) \,dt \\[6pt]
&amp; = \frac 1 2 m\omega \left( \frac{(x_i^2 + x_f^2) \cos\omega(t_f - t_i) - 2 x_i x_f}{\sin\omega(t_f - t_i)} \right)~.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Next, expand the non-classical contribution to the action {{mvar|δS}} as a Fourier series, which gives
:&lt;math&gt;S = S_\text{c} + \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \tfrac12 a_n^2 \frac{m}{2} \left( \frac{(n \pi)^2}{t_f - t_i} - \omega^2(t_f - t_i) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the propagator is
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) &amp; = Q e^\frac{i S_\text{c}}{\hbar} \prod_{j=1}^\infty \frac{j \pi}{\sqrt{2}} \int da_j \exp{\left( \frac{i}{2\hbar}a_j^2 \frac{m}{2} \left( \frac{(j \pi)^2}{t_f - t_i} - \omega^2(t_f - t_i) \right) \right)} \\[6pt]
&amp; = e^\frac{i S_\text{c}}{\hbar} Q \prod_{j=1}^\infty \left( 1 - \left( \frac{\omega(t_f - t_i)}{j \pi} \right)^2 \right)^{-\frac12}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
for some normalization
:&lt;math&gt; Q = \sqrt{\frac{m}{2\pi i \hbar (t_f - t_i)}}~. &lt;/math&gt;

Using the infinite-product representation of the [[sinc function]],
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{j=1}^\infty \left( 1 - \frac{x^2}{j^2} \right) = \frac{\sin\pi x}{\pi x}, &lt;/math&gt;
the propagator can be written as
:&lt;math&gt; K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) = Q e^\frac{i S_\text{c}}{\hbar} \sqrt{ \frac{\omega(t_f - t_i)}{\sin\omega(t_f - t_i)} } = e^\frac{i S_c}{\hbar} \sqrt{ \frac{m\omega}{2\pi i \hbar \sin\omega(t_f - t_i)}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{math|''T'' {{=}} ''t&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''t&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.  One may write this propagator in terms of energy eigenstates as
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) &amp; = \left( \frac{m \omega}{2 \pi i \hbar \sin\omega T } \right)^\frac12 \exp{ \left( \frac{i}{\hbar} \tfrac12 m \omega  \frac{ (x_i^2 + x_f^2) \cos \omega T - 2 x_i x_f }{ \sin \omega T } \right) } \\[6pt]
&amp; = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \exp{ \left( - \frac{i E_n T}{\hbar} \right) } \psi_n(x_f)^{*} \psi_n(x_i)~.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the identities {{math|''i'' sin ''ωT'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}''e''&lt;sup&gt;''iωT''&lt;/sup&gt; (1 − ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−2''iωT''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{math|cos ''ωT'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}''e''&lt;sup&gt;''iωT''&lt;/sup&gt; (1 + ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−2''iωT''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, this amounts to
:&lt;math&gt;K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) = \left( \frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar} \right)^\frac12 e^\frac{-i \omega T} 2 \left( 1 - e^{-2 i \omega T} \right)^{-\frac12} \exp{ \left( - \frac{m \omega}{2 \hbar} \left( \left(x_i^2 + x_f^2\right) \frac{ 1 + e^{-2 i \omega T} }{ 1 - e^{- 2 i \omega T}} - \frac{4 x_i x_f e^{-i \omega T}}{1 - e^{ - 2 i \omega T} }\right) \right) }.&lt;/math&gt;

One may absorb all terms after the first {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''iωT''/2&lt;/sup&gt;}} into {{math|''R''(''T'')}}, thereby  obtaining
:&lt;math&gt; K(x_f, t_f; x_i, t_i) = \left( \frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar} \right)^\frac12 e^\frac{-i \omega T } 2 \cdot R(T).&lt;/math&gt;

One may  finally expand {{math|''R''(''T'')}} in  powers of {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''iωT''&lt;/sup&gt;}}: All  terms in this expansion get multiplied by the {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''iωT''/2&lt;/sup&gt;}} factor in the front,  yielding terms  of the form
:&lt;math&gt;e^\frac{-i\omega T}{2} e^{-i n\omega T} = e^{-i \omega T \left( \frac12 + n\right) } \quad\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots.&lt;/math&gt;
Comparison  to the above eigenstate expansion  yields the  standard energy spectrum for the simple harmonic oscillator,
:&lt;math&gt;E_n = \left( n + \tfrac12 \right) \hbar \omega~.&lt;/math&gt;

{{see also|Propagator#Basic examples: propagator of free particle and harmonic oscillator}}

===Coulomb potential===
Feynman's time-sliced approximation does not, however, exist for the most important quantum-mechanical path integrals of atoms, due to the singularity of the [[Coulomb potential]] {{math|{{sfrac|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''r''}}}} at the origin. Only after replacing the time {{mvar|t}} by another path-dependent pseudo-time parameter
:&lt;math&gt;s = \int \frac{dt}{r(t)}&lt;/math&gt;
the singularity is removed and a time-sliced approximation exists, which is exactly integrable, since it can be made harmonic by a simple coordinate transformation, as discovered in 1979 by [[İsmail Hakkı Duru]] and [[Hagen Kleinert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duru|Kleinert|1979|loc=Chapter 13.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of a path-dependent time transformation and a coordinate transformation is an important tool to solve many path integrals and is called generically the [[Duru–Kleinert transformation]].

=== The Schrödinger equation ===

{{Main|Relation between Schrödinger's equation and the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics}}

The path integral reproduces the Schrödinger equation for the initial and final state even when a potential is present. This is easiest to see by taking a path-integral over infinitesimally separated times.
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(y;t+\varepsilon) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi(x;t)\int_{x(t)=x}^{x(t+\varepsilon)=y} e^{i\int\limits_t^{t+\varepsilon} \left(\frac{\dot{x}^2}{2} - V(x)\right)\, dt}\, Dx(t) \, dx\qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

Since the time separation is infinitesimal and the cancelling oscillations become severe for large values of {{mvar|ẋ}}, the path integral has most weight for {{mvar|y}} close to {{mvar|x}}. In this case, to lowest order the potential energy is constant, and only the kinetic energy contribution is nontrivial. (This separation of the kinetic and potential energy terms in the exponent is essentially the [[Lie product formula|Trotter product formula]].) The exponential of the action is
:&lt;math&gt;e^{-i\varepsilon V(x)} e^{i\frac{\dot{x}^2}{2}\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

The first term rotates the phase of {{math|''ψ''(''x'')}} locally by an amount proportional to the potential energy. The second term is the free particle propagator, corresponding to {{mvar|i}} times a diffusion process. To lowest order in {{mvar|ε}} they are additive; in any case one has with (1):

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(y;t+\varepsilon) \approx \int \psi(x;t) e^{-i\varepsilon V(x)} e^\frac{i(x-y)^2 }{ 2\varepsilon} \,dx\,.&lt;/math&gt;

As mentioned, the spread in {{mvar|ψ}} is diffusive from the free particle propagation, with an extra infinitesimal rotation in phase which slowly varies from point to point from the potential:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} = i\cdot \left(\tfrac12\nabla^2 - V(x)\right)\psi\,&lt;/math&gt;

and this is the Schrödinger equation. Note that the normalization of the path integral needs to be fixed in exactly the same way as in the free particle case. An arbitrary continuous potential does not affect the normalization, although singular potentials require careful treatment.

=== Equations of motion ===

Since the states obey the Schrödinger equation, the path integral must reproduce the Heisenberg equations of motion for the averages of {{mvar|x}} and  {{mvar|ẋ}} variables, but it is instructive to see this directly. The direct approach shows that the expectation values calculated from the path integral reproduce the usual ones of quantum mechanics.

Start by considering the path integral with some fixed initial state
:&lt;math&gt;\int \psi_0(x) \int_{x(0)=x} e^{iS(x,\dot{x})}\, Dx\,&lt;/math&gt;

Now note that {{mvar|''x''(''t'')}} at each separate time is a separate integration variable. So it is legitimate to change variables in the integral by shifting: {{math|''x''(''t'') {{=}} ''u''(''t'') + ''ε''(''t'')}} where {{math|''ε''(''t'')}} is a different shift at each time but {{math|''ε''(0) {{=}} ''ε''(''T'') {{=}} 0}}, since the endpoints are not integrated:
:&lt;math&gt;\int \psi_0(x) \int_{u(0)=x} e^{iS(u+\varepsilon,\dot{u}+\dot{\varepsilon})}\, Du\,&lt;/math&gt;

The change in the integral from the shift is, to first infinitesimal order in {{mvar|ε}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\int \psi_0(x) \int_{u(0)=x} \left( \int \frac{\partial S }{ \partial u } \varepsilon + \frac{ \partial S }{ \partial \dot{u} } \dot{\varepsilon}\, dt \right) e^{iS} \,Du\,&lt;/math&gt;

which, integrating by parts in {{mvar|t}}, gives:
:&lt;math&gt;\int \psi_0(x) \int_{u(0)=x} -\left( \int \left(\frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial S}{\partial \dot{u}} - \frac{\partial S}{\partial u}\right)\varepsilon(t)\, dt \right) e^{iS}\, Du\,&lt;/math&gt;

But this was just a shift of integration variables, which doesn't change the value of the integral for any choice of {{mvar|''ε''(''t'')}}. The conclusion is that this first order variation is zero for an arbitrary initial state and at any arbitrary point in time:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \psi_0\left| \frac{\delta S}{\delta x}(t) \right|\psi_0 \right\rangle = 0&lt;/math&gt;
this is the Heisenberg equation of motion.

If the action contains terms which multiply {{mvar|ẋ}} and {{mvar|x}}, at the same moment in time, the manipulations above are only heuristic, because the multiplication rules for these quantities is just as noncommuting in the path integral as it is in the operator formalism.

=== Stationary-phase approximation ===

If the variation in the action exceeds {{mvar|ħ}} by many orders of magnitude, we typically have destructive interference other than in the vicinity of those trajectories satisfying the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]], which is now reinterpreted as the condition for constructive interference. This can be shown using the method of stationary phase applied to the propagator. As {{mvar|ħ}} decreases, the exponential in the integral oscillates rapidly in the complex domain for any change in the action. Thus, in the limit that {{mvar|ħ}} goes to zero, only points where the classical action does not vary contribute to the propagator.

=== Canonical commutation relations ===

The formulation of the path integral does not make it clear at first sight that the quantities {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|p}} do not commute. In the path integral, these are just integration variables and they have no obvious ordering. Feynman discovered that the non-commutativity is still present.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman|1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To see this, consider the simplest path integral, the brownian walk. This is not yet quantum mechanics, so in the path-integral the action is not multiplied by {{mvar|i}}:

:&lt;math&gt;S=  \int \left( \frac{dx}{dt} \right)^2\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity {{mvar|''x''(''t'')}} is fluctuating, and the derivative is defined as the limit of a discrete difference.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{x(t+\varepsilon) - x(t)} \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the distance that a random walk moves is proportional to {{math|{{sqrt|''t''}}}}, so that:
:&lt;math&gt;x(t+\varepsilon) - x(t) \approx \sqrt{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the random walk is not differentiable, since the ratio that defines the derivative diverges with probability one.

The quantity {{mvar|xẋ}} is ambiguous, with two possible meanings:

:&lt;math&gt;[1] = x \frac{dx}{dt}  = x(t) \frac{x(t+\varepsilon) - x(t) }{\varepsilon } &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;[2] = x \frac{dx}{dt} = x(t+\varepsilon) \frac{x(t+\varepsilon) - x(t) }{\varepsilon} &lt;/math&gt;

In elementary calculus, the two are only different by an amount which goes to 0 as {{mvar|ε}} goes to 0. But in this case, the difference between the two is not 0:

:&lt;math&gt;[2] - [1] =  \frac{\big( x(t + \varepsilon) - x(t)\big )^2}{\varepsilon} \approx \frac \varepsilon \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

give a name to the value of the difference for any one random walk:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\big(x(t+\varepsilon)- x(t)\big)^2 }{\varepsilon} = f(t)&lt;/math&gt;

and note that {{math|''f''(''t'')}} is a rapidly fluctuating statistical quantity, whose average value is 1, i.e. a normalized "Gaussian process". The fluctuations of such a quantity can be described by a statistical Lagrangian
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal L =  (f(t)-1)^2 \,,&lt;/math&gt;
and the equations of motion for {{mvar|f}} derived from extremizing the action {{mvar|S}} corresponding to {{mathcal|L}} just set it equal to 1. In physics, such a quantity is "equal to 1 as an operator identity". In mathematics, it "weakly converges to 1". In either case, it is 1 in any expectation value, or when averaged over any interval, or for all practical purpose.

Defining the time order to ''be'' the operator order:
:&lt;math&gt;[x, \dot x] = x \frac{dx}{dt} - \frac{dx}{dt} x = 1&lt;/math&gt;

This is called the [[Itō lemma]] in [[stochastic calculus]], and the (euclideanized) canonical commutation relations in physics.

For a general statistical action, a similar argument shows that
:&lt;math&gt;\left[x , \frac{\partial S }{ \partial \dot x} \right] = 1&lt;/math&gt;
and in quantum mechanics, the extra imaginary unit in the action converts this to the canonical commutation relation,
:&lt;math&gt;[x,p ] = i&lt;/math&gt;

=== Particle in curved space ===

For a particle in curved space the kinetic term depends on the position, and the above time slicing cannot be applied, this being a manifestation of the notorious [[operator ordering problem]] in Schrödinger quantum mechanics. One may, however, solve this problem by transforming the time-sliced flat-space path integral to curved space using a multivalued coordinate transformation ([[nonholonomic mapping]] explained [http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/b5/psfiles/pthic10.pdf here]).

=== Measure-theoretic factors ===
Sometimes (e.g. a particle moving in curved space) we also have measure-theoretic factors in the functional integral:
:&lt;math&gt;\int \mu[x] e^{iS[x]} \,\mathcal{D}x.&lt;/math&gt;
This factor is needed to restore unitarity.

For instance, if
:&lt;math&gt;S = \int \left( \frac{m}{2} g_{ij} \dot{x}^i \dot{x}^j - V(x) \right) \,dt,&lt;/math&gt;
then it means that each spatial slice is multiplied by the measure {{math|{{sqrt|''g''}}}}. This measure cannot be expressed as a functional multiplying the {{math|{{mathcal|D}}''x''}} measure because they belong to entirely different classes.

==Euclidean path integrals==
It is very common in path integrals to perform a [[Wick rotation]] from real to imaginary times. In the setting of quantum field theory, the Wick rotation changes the geometry of space-time from Lorentzian to Euclidean; as a result, Wick-rotated path integrals are often called Euclidean path integrals.

===Wick rotation and the Feynman–Kac formula===
If we replace &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;-it&lt;/math&gt;, the time-evolution operator &lt;math&gt;e^{-it\hat{H}/\hbar}&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;e^{-t\hat{H}/\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;. (This change is known as a [[Wick rotation]].) If we repeat the derivation of the path-integral formula in this setting, we obtain&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013|loc=Section 20.3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x,t)=\frac{1}{Z}\int_{\mathbf{x}(0)=x} e^{-S_{\mathrm{Euclidean}}(\mathbf{x},\dot{\mathbf{x}})/\hbar}\psi_0(\mathbf{x}(t))\, \mathcal{D}\mathbf{x}\,&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{Euclidean}}&lt;/math&gt; is the Euclidean action, given by
:&lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{Euclidean}}(\mathbf{x},\dot{\mathbf{x}})=\int\left[ \frac{m}{2}|\dot\mathbf{x}(t)|^2+V(\mathbf{x}(t))\right] \,dt&lt;/math&gt;.
Note the sign change between this and the normal action, where the potential energy term is negative. (The term ''Euclidean'' is from the context of quantum field theory, where the change from real to imaginary time changes the space-time geometry from Lorentzian to Euclidean.)

Now, the contribution of the kinetic energy to the path integral is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{Z}\int_{\mathbf{x}(0)=x} f(\mathbf{x})e^{-\frac{m}{2}\int |\dot\mathbf{x}|^2dt}\, \mathcal{D}\mathbf{x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; includes all the remaining dependence of the integrand on the path. This integral has a rigorous mathematical interpretation as integration against the [[Wiener process|Wiener measure]], denoted &lt;math&gt;\mu_{x}&lt;/math&gt;. The Wiener measure, constructed by [[Norbert Wiener]] gives a rigorous foundation to [[Brownian motion#Einstein.27s theory|Einstein's mathematical model of Brownian motion]]. The subscript &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the measure &lt;math&gt;\mu_x&lt;/math&gt; is supported on paths &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(0)=x&lt;/math&gt;.

We then have a rigorous version of the Feynman path integral, known as the [[Feynman–Kac formula]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2013|loc=Theorem 20.3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(x,t)=\int e^{-\int V(\mathbf{x}(t)\,dt/\hbar}\,\psi_0(\mathbf{x}(t)) \,d\mu_x(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;,

where now &lt;math&gt;\psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the Wick-rotated version of the Schrödinger equation,
:&lt;math&gt;\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi(x,t) = -\hat H \psi(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;.
Although the Wick-rotated Schrödinger equation does not have a direct physical meaning, interesting properties of the Schrödinger operator &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt; can be extracted by studying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the study of quantum field theories from the path-integral perspective, in both the mathematics and physics literatures, is done in the Euclidean setting, that is, after a Wick rotation. In particular, there are various results showing that if a Euclidean field theory with suitable properties can be constructed, one can then undo the Wick rotation to recover the physical, Lorentzian theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glimm|Jaffe|1981|loc=Chapter 19.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is much more difficult to give a meaning to path integrals (even Euclidean path integrals) in quantum field theory than in quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief account of the origins of these difficulties, see {{harvtxt|Hall|2013|loc=Section 20.6.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The path integral and the partition function ===

The path integral is just the generalization of the integral above to all quantum mechanical problems—
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \int  e^\frac{i\mathcal{S}[\mathbf{x}]}{\hbar}\, \mathcal{D}\mathbf{x} \quad\text{where }\mathcal{S}[\mathbf{x}]=\int_0^T L[\mathbf{x}(t),\dot\mathbf{x}(t)]\, dt&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[action (physics)|action]] of the classical problem in which one investigates the path starting at time {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}} and ending at time {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''T''}}, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; denotes integration over all paths. In the classical limit, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}[\mathbf{x}]\gg\hbar&lt;/math&gt;, the path of minimum action dominates the integral, because the phase of any path away from this fluctuates rapidly and different contributions cancel.&lt;ref name="Feynman-Hibbs"&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman|Hibbs|Styer|2010|pp=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection with [[statistical mechanics]] follows. Considering only paths which begin and end in the same configuration, perform the [[Wick rotation]] {{math|''it'' {{=}} ''τ''}}, i.e., make time imaginary, and integrate over all possible beginning-ending configurations. The Wick-rotated path integral—described in the previous subsection, with the ordinary action replaced by its "Euclidean" counterpart—now resembles the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] of statistical mechanics defined in a [[canonical ensemble]] with inverse temperature proportional to imaginary time, {{math|{{sfrac|1|''T''}} {{=}} {{sfrac|''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''τ''|''ħ''}}}}. Strictly speaking, though, this is the partition function for a [[statistical field theory]].

Clearly, such a deep analogy between quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics cannot be dependent on the formulation. In the canonical formulation, one sees that the unitary evolution operator of a state is given by

:&lt;math&gt;|\alpha;t\rangle=e^{-\frac{iHt}{\hbar}}|\alpha;0\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where the state {{mvar|α}} is evolved from time {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}. If one makes a Wick rotation here, and finds the amplitude to go from any state, back to the same state in (imaginary) time {{mvar|iT}} is given by

: &lt;math&gt;Z = \operatorname{Tr} \left[e^\frac{-HT}{\hbar}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

which is precisely the partition function of statistical mechanics for the same system at temperature quoted earlier. One aspect of this equivalence was also known to [[Erwin Schrödinger]] who remarked that the equation named after him looked like the [[diffusion equation]] after Wick rotation. Note, however, that the Euclidean path integral is actually in the form of a ''classical'' statistical mechanics model.

== Quantum field theory ==
{{Quantum field theory}}
Both the Schrödinger and Heisenberg approaches to quantum mechanics single out time and are not in the spirit of relativity. For example, the Heisenberg approach requires that scalar field operators obey the commutation relation

:&lt;math&gt;[\varphi(x), \partial_t \varphi(y)] = i \delta^3(x - y)&lt;/math&gt;

for two simultaneous spatial positions {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}, and this is not a relativistically invariant concept. The results of a calculation ''are'' covariant, but the symmetry is not apparent in intermediate stages. If naive field-theory calculations did not produce infinite answers in the continuum limit, this would not have been such a big problem – it would just have been a bad choice of coordinates. But the lack of symmetry means that the infinite quantities must be cut off, and the bad coordinates make it nearly impossible to cut off the theory without spoiling the symmetry. This makes it difficult to extract the physical predictions, which require a [[renormalization|careful limiting procedure]].

The problem of lost symmetry also appears in classical mechanics, where the Hamiltonian formulation also superficially singles out time. The Lagrangian formulation makes the relativistic invariance apparent. In the same way, the path integral is manifestly relativistic. It reproduces the Schrödinger equation, the Heisenberg equations of motion, and the canonical commutation relations and shows that they are compatible with relativity. It extends the Heisenberg-type operator algebra to [[operator product expansion|operator product rules]], which are new relations difficult to see in the old formalism.

Further, different choices of canonical variables lead to very different-seeming formulations of the same theory. The transformations between the variables can be very complicated, but the path integral makes them into reasonably straightforward changes of integration variables. For these reasons, the Feynman path integral has made earlier formalisms largely obsolete.

The price of a path integral representation is that the unitarity of a theory is no longer self-evident, but it can be proven by changing variables to some canonical representation. The path integral itself also deals with larger mathematical spaces than is usual, which requires more careful mathematics, not all of which has been fully worked out. The path integral historically was not immediately accepted, partly because it took many years to incorporate fermions properly. This required physicists to invent an entirely new mathematical object – the [[Grassmann variable]] – which also allowed changes of variables to be done naturally, as well as allowing [[Faddeev–Popov ghost|constrained quantization]].

The integration variables in the path integral are subtly non-commuting. The value of the product of two field operators at what looks like the same point depends on how the two points are ordered in space and time. This makes some naive identities [[Anomaly (physics)|fail]].

=== The propagator ===

In relativistic theories, there is both a particle and field representation for every theory. The field representation is a sum over all field configurations, and the particle representation is a sum over different particle paths.

The nonrelativistic formulation is traditionally given in terms of particle paths, not fields. There, the path integral in the usual variables, with fixed boundary conditions, gives the probability amplitude for a particle to go from point {{mvar|x}} to point {{mvar|y}} in time {{mvar|T}}:

:&lt;math&gt;K(x, y; T) = \langle y; T \mid x; 0 \rangle = \int_{x(0)=x}^{x(T)=y} e^{i S[x]} \,Dx.&lt;/math&gt;

This is called the [[propagator]]. Superposing different values of the initial position {{mvar|x}} with an arbitrary initial state {{math|''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} constructs the final state:
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_T(y) = \int_x \psi_0(x) K(x, y; T) \,dx = \int^{x(T)=y} \psi_0(x(0)) e^{i S[x]} \,Dx.&lt;/math&gt;

For a spatially homogeneous system, where {{math|''K''(''x'', ''y'')}} is only a function of {{math|(''x'' − ''y'')}}, the integral is a [[convolution]], the final state is the initial state convolved with the propagator:
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_T = \psi_0 * K(;T).&lt;/math&gt;

For a free particle of mass {{mvar|m}}, the propagator can be evaluated either explicitly from the path integral or by noting that the Schrödinger equation is a diffusion equation in imaginary time, and the solution must be a normalized Gaussian:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x, y; T) \propto e^\frac{i m(x - y)^2}{2T}.&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the Fourier transform in {{math|(''x'' − ''y'')}} produces another Gaussian:

:&lt;math&gt;K(p; T) = e^\frac{i T p^2}{2m},&lt;/math&gt;

and in {{mvar|p}}-space the proportionality factor here is constant in time, as will be verified in a moment. The Fourier transform in time, extending {{math|''K''(''p''; ''T'')}} to be zero for negative times, gives Green's function, or the frequency-space propagator:
:&lt;math&gt;G_\text{F}(p, E) = \frac{-i}{E - \frac{\vec{p}^2}{2m} + i\varepsilon},&lt;/math&gt;

which is the reciprocal of the operator that annihilates the wavefunction in the Schrödinger equation, which wouldn't have come out right if the proportionality factor weren't constant in the {{mvar|p}}-space representation.

The infinitesimal term in the denominator is a small positive number, which guarantees that the inverse Fourier transform in {{mvar|E}} will be nonzero only for future times. For past times, the inverse Fourier transform contour closes toward values of {{mvar|E}} where there is no singularity. This guarantees that {{mvar|K}} propagates the particle into the future and is the reason for the subscript "F" on {{mvar|G}}. The infinitesimal term can be interpreted as an infinitesimal rotation toward imaginary time.

It is also possible to reexpress the nonrelativistic time evolution in terms of propagators going toward the past, since the Schrödinger equation is time-reversible. The past propagator is the same as the future propagator except for the obvious difference that it vanishes in the future, and in the Gaussian {{mvar|t}} is replaced by {{math|−''t''}}. In this case, the interpretation is that these are the quantities to convolve the final wavefunction so as to get the initial wavefunction:
:&lt;math&gt;G_\text{B}(p, E) = \frac{-i}{-E - \frac{i\vec{p}^2}{2m} + i\varepsilon}.&lt;/math&gt;
Given the nearly identical only change is the sign of {{mvar|E}} and {{mvar|ε}}, the parameter {{mvar|E}} in Green's function can either be the energy if the paths are going toward the future, or the negative of the energy if the paths are going toward the past.

For a nonrelativistic theory, the time as measured along the path of a moving particle and the time as measured by an outside observer are the same. In relativity, this is no longer true. For a relativistic theory the propagator should be defined as the sum over all paths that travel between two points in a fixed proper time, as measured along the path (these paths describe the trajectory of a particle in space and in time):

:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y, \Tau) = \int_{x(0)=x}^{x(\Tau)=y} e^{i \int_0^\Tau \sqrt{{\dot x}^2} - \alpha \,d\tau}.&lt;/math&gt;

The integral above is not trivial to interpret because of the square root. Fortunately, there is a heuristic trick. The sum is over the relativistic arc length of the path of an oscillating quantity, and like the nonrelativistic path integral should be interpreted as slightly rotated into imaginary time. The function {{math|''K''(''x'' − ''y'', ''τ'')}} can be evaluated when the sum is over paths in Euclidean space:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y, \Tau) = e^{-\alpha \Tau} \int_{x(0)=x}^{x(\Tau)=y} e^{-L}.&lt;/math&gt;

This describes a sum over all paths of length {{math|Τ}} of the exponential of minus the length. This can be given a probability interpretation. The sum over all paths is a probability average over a path constructed step by step. The total number of steps is proportional to {{math|Τ}}, and each step is less likely the longer it is. By the [[central limit theorem]], the result of many independent steps is a Gaussian of variance proportional to {{math|Τ}}:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y,\Tau) = e^{-\alpha \Tau} e^{-\frac{(x - y)^2}{\Tau}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The usual definition of the relativistic propagator only asks for the amplitude is to travel from {{mvar|x}} to {{mvar|y}}, after summing over all the possible proper times it could take:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y) = \int_0^\infty K(x - y, \Tau) W(\Tau) \,d\Tau,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''W''(Τ)}} is a weight factor, the relative importance of paths of different proper time. By the translation symmetry in proper time, this weight can only be an exponential factor and can be absorbed into the constant {{mvar|α}}:
:&lt;math&gt;K(x - y) = \int_0^\infty e^{-\frac{(x - y)^2}{\Tau} -\alpha \Tau} \,d\Tau.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[Feynman diagram#Schwinger representation|Schwinger representation]]. Taking a Fourier transform over the variable {{math|(''x'' − ''y'')}} can be done for each value of {{math|Τ}} separately, and because each separate {{math|Τ}} contribution is a Gaussian, gives whose Fourier transform is another Gaussian with reciprocal width. So in {{mvar|p}}-space, the propagator can be reexpressed simply:
:&lt;math&gt;K(p) = \int_0^\infty e^{-\Tau p^2 - \Tau \alpha} \,d\Tau = \frac{1}{p^2 + \alpha},&lt;/math&gt;

which is the Euclidean propagator for a scalar particle. Rotating {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} to be imaginary gives the usual relativistic propagator, up to a factor of {{math|−''i''}} and an ambiguity, which will be clarified below:
:&lt;math&gt;K(p) = \frac{i}{p_0^2 - \vec{p}^2 - m^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This expression can be interpreted in the nonrelativistic limit, where it is convenient to split it by [[partial fractions]]:

:&lt;math&gt;2 p_0 K(p) = \frac{i}{p_0 - \sqrt{\vec{p}^2 + m^2}} + \frac{i}{p_0 + \sqrt{\vec{p}^2 + m^2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

For states where one nonrelativistic particle is present, the initial wavefunction has a frequency distribution concentrated near {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''}}. When convolving with the propagator, which in {{mvar|p}} space just means multiplying by the propagator, the second term is suppressed and the first term is enhanced. For frequencies near {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''}}, the dominant first term has the form

:&lt;math&gt;2m K_\text{NR}(p) = \frac{i}{(p_0 - m) - \frac{\vec{p}^2}{2m}}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the expression for the nonrelativistic [[Green's function]] of a free Schrödinger particle.

The second term has a nonrelativistic limit also, but this limit is concentrated on frequencies that are negative. The second pole is dominated by contributions from paths where the proper time and the coordinate time are ticking in an opposite sense, which means that the second term is to be interpreted as the antiparticle. The nonrelativistic analysis shows that with this form the antiparticle still has positive energy.

The proper way to express this mathematically is that, adding a small suppression factor in proper time, the limit where {{math|''t'' → −∞}} of the first term must vanish, while the {{math|''t'' → +∞}} limit of the second term must vanish. In the Fourier transform, this means shifting the pole in {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} slightly, so that the inverse Fourier transform will pick up a small decay factor in one of the time directions:

:&lt;math&gt;K(p) = \frac{i}{p_0 - \sqrt{\vec{p}^2 + m^2} + i\varepsilon} + \frac{i}{p_0 - \sqrt{\vec{p}^2+m^2} - i\varepsilon}.&lt;/math&gt;

Without these terms, the pole contribution could not be unambiguously evaluated when taking the inverse Fourier transform of {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The terms can be recombined:

:&lt;math&gt;K(p) = \frac{i}{p^2 - m^2 + i\varepsilon},&lt;/math&gt;

which when factored, produces opposite-sign infinitesimal terms in each factor. This is the mathematically precise form of the relativistic particle propagator, free of any ambiguities. The {{mvar|ε}} term introduces a small imaginary part to the {{math|''α'' {{=}} ''m''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which in the Minkowski version is a small exponential suppression of long paths.

So in the relativistic case, the Feynman path-integral representation of the propagator includes paths going backwards in time, which describe antiparticles. The paths that contribute to the relativistic propagator go forward and backwards in time, and the [[Feynman–Stueckelberg interpretation|interpretation]] of this is that the amplitude for a free particle to travel between two points includes amplitudes for the particle to fluctuate into an antiparticle, travel back in time, then forward again.

Unlike the nonrelativistic case, it is impossible to produce a relativistic theory of local particle propagation without including antiparticles. All local differential operators have inverses that are nonzero outside the light cone, meaning that it is impossible to keep a particle from travelling faster than light. Such a particle cannot have a Green's function which is only nonzero in the future in a relativistically invariant theory.

=== Functionals of fields ===

However, the path integral formulation is also extremely important in ''direct'' application to quantum field theory, in which the "paths" or histories being considered are not the motions of a single particle, but the possible time evolutions of a [[field (physics)|field]] over all space.  The action is referred to technically as a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] of the field: {{math|''S''[''ϕ'']}}, where the field {{math|''ϕ''(''x&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} is itself a function of space and time, and the square brackets are a reminder that the action depends on all the field's values everywhere, not just some particular value. ''One'' such given function {{math|''ϕ''(''x&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} of [[spacetime]] is called a ''field configuration''. In principle, one integrates Feynman's amplitude over the class of all possible field configurations.

Much of the formal study of QFT is devoted to the properties of the resulting functional integral, and much effort (not yet entirely successful) has been made toward making these [[functional integral]]s mathematically precise.

Such a functional integral is extremely similar to the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] in [[statistical mechanics]].  Indeed, it is sometimes ''called'' a [[partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]], and the two are essentially mathematically identical except for the factor of {{mvar|i}} in the exponent in Feynman's postulate 3. [[Analytic continuation|Analytically continuing]] the integral to an imaginary time variable (called a [[Wick rotation]]) makes the functional integral even more like a statistical partition function and also tames some of the mathematical difficulties of working with these integrals.

=== Expectation values ===

In [[quantum field theory]], if the [[action (physics)|action]] is given by the [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] {{mathcal|S}} of field configurations (which only depends locally on the fields), then the [[time-ordered]] [[vacuum expectation value]] of [[polynomially bounded]] functional {{mvar|F}}, {{math|{{angbr|''F''}}}}, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\langle F \rangle = \frac{\int\mathcal{D}\varphi F[\varphi]e^{i\mathcal{S}[\varphi]}}{\int\mathcal{D}\varphi e^{i\mathcal{S}[\varphi]}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The symbol {{math|∫{{mathcal|D}}''ϕ''}} here is a concise way to represent the infinite-dimensional integral over all possible field configurations on all of space-time. As stated above, the unadorned path integral in the denominator ensures proper normalization.

=== As a probability ===
Strictly speaking, the only question that can be asked in physics is: ''What fraction of states satisfying condition {{mvar|A}} also satisfy condition {{mvar|B}}?'' The answer to this is a number between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a [[conditional probability]], written as {{math|P(''B''{{!}}''A'')}}. In terms of path integration, since {{math|P(''B''{{!}}''A'') {{=}} {{sfrac|P(''A''∩''B'')&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;P(''A'')}}}}, this means

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P}(B\mid A) = \frac
{\sum_{F \subset A \cap B}\left| \int\mathcal{D}\varphi O_\text{in}[\varphi]e^{i\mathcal{S}[\varphi]}  F[\varphi]\right|^2}
{\sum_{F \subset A} \left|\int\mathcal{D}\varphi O_\text{in}[\varphi] e^{i\mathcal{S}[\varphi]} F[\varphi]\right|^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where the functional {{math|''O''&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;[''ϕ'']}} is the superposition of all incoming states that could lead to the states we are interested in. In particular, this could be a state corresponding to the state of the Universe just after the [[Big Bang]], although for actual calculation this can be simplified using heuristic methods. Since this expression is a quotient of path integrals, it is naturally normalised.

=== Schwinger–Dyson equations ===
{{Main|Schwinger–Dyson equation}}

Since this formulation of quantum mechanics is analogous to classical action principle, one might expect that identities concerning the action in classical mechanics would have quantum counterparts derivable from a functional integral. This is often the case.

In the language of functional analysis, we can write the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta \mathcal{S}[\varphi]}{\delta \varphi} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
(the left-hand side is a [[functional derivative]]; the equation means that the action is stationary under small changes in the field configuration).  The quantum analogues of these equations are called the [[Schwinger–Dyson equation]]s.

If the [[functional measure]] {{math|{{mathcal|D}}''ϕ''}} turns out to be [[Translational symmetry|translationally invariant]] (we'll assume this for the rest of this article, although this does not hold for, let's say [[nonlinear sigma model]]s), and if we assume that after a [[Wick rotation]]

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i\mathcal{S}[\varphi]},&lt;/math&gt;

which now becomes
:&lt;math&gt;e^{-H[\varphi]}&lt;/math&gt;
for some {{mvar|H}}, it goes to zero faster than a [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of any [[polynomial]] for large values of {{mvar|φ}}, then we can [[integration by parts|integrate by parts]] (after a Wick rotation, followed by a Wick rotation back) to get the following Schwinger–Dyson equations for the expectation:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \frac{\delta F[\varphi]}{\delta \varphi} \right\rangle = -i \left\langle F[\varphi]\frac{\delta \mathcal{S}[\varphi]}{\delta\varphi} \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

for any polynomially-bounded functional {{mvar|F}}. In the [[deWitt notation]] this looks like&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarpedia.org/Path_integral Jean Zinn-Justin (2009), ''Scholarpedia'' '''4'''(2):8674 ].&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle F_{,i} \right\rangle = -i \left\langle F \mathcal{S}_{,i} \right\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

These equations are the analog of the [[on-shell]] EL equations. The time ordering is taken before the time derivatives inside the {{math|{{mathcal|S}}&lt;sub&gt;,''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

If {{mvar|J}} (called the [[source field]]) is an element of the [[dual space]] of the field configurations (which has at least an [[affine structure]] because of the assumption of the [[translational invariance]] for the functional measure), then the [[generating functional]] {{mvar|Z}} of the source fields is '''defined''' to be

:&lt;math&gt;Z[J] = \int \mathcal{D}\varphi e^{i\left(\mathcal{S}[\varphi] + \langle J,\varphi \rangle\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta^n Z}{\delta J(x_1) \cdots \delta J(x_n)}[J] = i^n \, Z[J] \, \left\langle \varphi(x_1)\cdots \varphi(x_n)\right\rangle_J,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;Z^{,i_1\cdots i_n}[J] = i^n Z[J] \left \langle \varphi^{i_1}\cdots \varphi^{i_n}\right\rangle_J,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\langle F \rangle_J = \frac{\int \mathcal{D}\varphi F[\varphi]e^{i\left(\mathcal{S}[\varphi] + \langle J,\varphi \rangle\right)}}{\int\mathcal{D}\varphi e^{i\left(\mathcal{S}[\varphi] + \langle J,\varphi \rangle\right)}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Basically, if {{math|{{mathcal|D}}''φ'' ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''{{mathcal|S}}[''φ'']&lt;/sup&gt;}} is viewed as a functional distribution (this shouldn't be taken too literally as an interpretation of [[Quantum field theory|QFT]], unlike its Wick-rotated [[statistical mechanics]] analogue, because we have [[time ordering]] complications here!), then {{math|{{angbr|''φ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ... ''φ''(''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}}} are its [[moment (mathematics)|moments]], and {{mvar|Z}} is its [[Fourier transform]].

If {{mvar|F}} is a functional of {{mvar|φ}}, then for an [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] {{mvar|K}}, {{math|''F''[''K'']}} is defined to be the operator that substitutes {{mvar|K}} for {{mvar|φ}}. For example, if

:&lt;math&gt;F[\varphi] = \frac{\partial^{k_1}}{\partial x_1^{k_1}}\varphi(x_1)\cdots \frac{\partial^{k_n}}{\partial x_n^{k_n}}\varphi(x_n),&lt;/math&gt;

and {{mvar|G}} is a functional of {{mvar|J}}, then

:&lt;math&gt;F\left[-i\frac{\delta}{\delta J}\right] G[J] = (-i)^n \frac{\partial^{k_1}}{\partial x_1^{k_1}}\frac{\delta}{\delta J(x_1)} \cdots \frac{\partial^{k_n}}{\partial x_n^{k_n}}\frac{\delta}{\delta J(x_n)} G[J].&lt;/math&gt;

Then, from the properties of the [[functional integral]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\left \langle \frac{\delta \mathcal{S}}{\delta \varphi(x)} [\varphi] + J(x)\right\rangle_J = 0&lt;/math&gt;

we get the "master" Schwinger–Dyson equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta \mathcal{S}}{\delta \varphi(x)}\left[-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}\right]Z[J] + J(x)Z[J] = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{,i}[-i\partial]Z + J_i Z = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If the functional measure is not translationally invariant, it might be possible to express it as the product {{math|''M''[''φ''] {{mathcal|D}}''φ''}}, where {{mvar|M}} is a functional and {{math|{{mathcal|D}}''φ''}} is a translationally invariant measure. This is true, for example, for nonlinear sigma models where the [[target space]] is diffeomorphic to {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. However, if the [[target manifold]] is some topologically nontrivial space, the concept of a translation does not even make any sense.

In that case, we would have to replace the {{mathcal|S}} in this equation by another functional
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathcal{S}} = \mathcal{S} - i\ln M.&lt;/math&gt;

If we expand this equation as a [[Taylor series]] about ''J'' {{=}} 0, we get the entire set of Schwinger–Dyson equations.

== Localization ==
The path integrals are usually thought of as being the sum of all paths through an infinite space–time. However, in [[local quantum field theory]] we would restrict everything to lie within a finite ''causally complete'' region, for example inside a double light-cone. This gives a more mathematically precise and physically rigorous definition of quantum field theory.

=== Ward–Takahashi identities ===
{{main|Ward–Takahashi identity}}

Now how about the [[on shell]] [[Noether's theorem]] for the classical case? Does it have a quantum analog as well? Yes, but with a caveat. The functional measure would have to be invariant under the one parameter group of symmetry transformation as well.

Let's just assume for simplicity here that the symmetry in question is local (not local in the sense of a [[gauge symmetry]], but in the sense that the transformed value of the field at any given point under an infinitesimal transformation would only depend on the field configuration over an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the point in question). Let's also assume that the action is local in the sense that it is the integral over spacetime of a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]], and that
:&lt;math&gt;Q[\mathcal{L}(x)]=\partial_\mu f^\mu (x)&lt;/math&gt;
for some function {{mvar|f}} where {{mvar|f}} only depends locally on {{mvar|φ}} (and possibly the spacetime position).

If we don't assume any special boundary conditions, this would not be a "true" symmetry in the true sense of the term in general unless {{math|''f'' {{=}} 0}} or something. Here, {{mvar|Q}} is a [[Derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]] which generates the one parameter group in question. We could have [[antiderivation]]s as well, such as [[BRST quantization|BRST]] and [[supersymmetry]].

Let's also assume
:&lt;math&gt;\int \mathcal{D}\varphi\, Q[F][\varphi]=0&lt;/math&gt;
for any polynomially-bounded functional {{mvar|F}}. This property is called the invariance of the measure. And this does not hold in general. See [[anomaly (physics)]] for more details.

Then,
:&lt;math&gt;\int \mathcal{D}\varphi\, Q\left[F e^{iS}\right][\varphi]=0,&lt;/math&gt;

which implies
:&lt;math&gt;\langle Q[F]\rangle +i\left\langle F\int_{\partial V} f^\mu\, ds_\mu\right\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is over the boundary. This is the quantum analog of Noether's theorem.

Now, let's assume even further that {{mvar|Q}} is a local integral

:&lt;math&gt;Q=\int d^dx\, q(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;q(x)[\varphi(y)] = \delta^{(d)}(X-y)Q[\varphi(y)] \,&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;q(x)[S]=\partial_\mu j^\mu (x) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;j^{\mu}(x)=f^\mu(x)-\frac{\partial}{\partial (\partial_\mu \varphi)}\mathcal{L}(x) Q[\varphi] \,&lt;/math&gt;

(this is assuming the Lagrangian only depends on {{mvar|φ}} and its first partial derivatives! More general Lagrangians would require a modification to this definition!). Note that we're NOT insisting that {{math|''q''(''x'')}} is the generator of a symmetry (i.e. we are ''not'' insisting upon the [[gauge principle]]), but just that {{mvar|Q}} is.  And we also assume the even stronger assumption that the functional measure is locally invariant:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \mathcal{D}\varphi\, q(x)[F][\varphi]=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Then, we would have

:&lt;math&gt;\langle q(x)[F] \rangle +i\langle F q(x)[S]\rangle=\langle q(x)[F]\rangle +i\left\langle F\partial_\mu j^\mu(x)\right\rangle=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively,

:&lt;math&gt;q(x)[S]\left[-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}\right]Z[J]+J(x)Q[\varphi(x)]\left[-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}\right]Z[J]=\partial_\mu j^\mu(x)\left[-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}\right]Z[J]+J(x)Q[\varphi(x)]\left[-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}\right]Z[J]=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The above two equations are the '''Ward–Takahashi identities'''.

Now for the case where {{math|''f'' {{=}} 0}}, we can forget about all the boundary conditions and locality assumptions. We'd simply have

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle Q[F]\right\rangle =0.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively,

:&lt;math&gt;\int d^dx\, J(x)Q[\varphi(x)]\left[-i \frac{\delta}{\delta J}\right]Z[J]=0.&lt;/math&gt;

== The need for regulators and renormalization ==

Path integrals as they are defined here require the introduction of [[Regularization (physics)|regulators]]. Changing the scale of the regulator leads to the [[renormalization group]]. In fact, renormalization is the major obstruction to making path integrals well-defined.

== The path integral in quantum-mechanical interpretation ==

In one [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]], the "sum over histories" interpretation, the path integral is taken to be fundamental, and reality is viewed as a single indistinguishable "class" of paths that all share the same events.  For this interpretation, it is crucial to understand what exactly an event is. The sum-over-histories method gives identical results to canonical quantum mechanics, and Sinha and Sorkin&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sinha|Sorkin|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim the interpretation explains the [[Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox]] without resorting to [[action at a distance|nonlocality]].

Some{{who|date=August 2014}} advocates of interpretations of quantum mechanics emphasizing [[decoherence]] have attempted to make more rigorous the notion of extracting a classical-like "coarse-grained" history from the space of all possible histories.

== Quantum gravity ==
Whereas in quantum mechanics the path integral formulation is fully equivalent to other formulations, it may be that it can be extended to quantum gravity, which would make it different from the [[Hilbert space]] model. Feynman had some success in this direction, and his work has been extended by [[Stephen Hawking|Hawking]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gell-Mann|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approaches that use this method include [[causal dynamical triangulation]]s and [[spinfoam]] models.

== Quantum tunneling ==
[[Quantum tunnelling]] can be modeled by using the path integral formation to determine the action of the trajectory through a potential barrier. Using the [[WKB approximation]], the tunneling rate ({{math|Γ}}) can be determined to be of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma = A_\mathrm{o} \exp \left(-\frac{S_\mathrm{eff}}{\hbar}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

with the effective action {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;}} and pre-exponential factor {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This form is specifically useful in a [[dissipative system]], in which the systems and surroundings must be modeled together. Using the [[Langevin equation]] to model [[Brownian motion]], the path integral formation can be used to determine an effective action and pre-exponential model to see the effect of dissipation on tunnelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caldeira|Leggett|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this model, tunneling rates of macroscopic systems (at finite temperatures) can be predicted.

The '''precedence effect''' or '''law of the first wavefront''' is a [[Sound localization|binaural]] [[psychoacoustics|psychoacoustical]] effect. When a sound is followed by another sound separated by a sufficiently short time delay (below the listener's echo threshold), listeners perceive a single auditory event; its [[perception|perceived]] spatial location is dominated by the location of the first-arriving sound (the first [[wave front]]). The lagging sound also affects the perceived location. However, its effect is suppressed by the first-arriving sound.

The '''Haas effect''' is a [[psychoacoustical]] effect, described in 1949&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aes.org/par/h/#Haas_Effect (After Helmut Haas's doctorate dissertation presented to the University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany as "Über den Einfluss eines Einfachechos auf die Hörsamkeit von Sprache;" translated into English by Dr. Ing. K.P.R. Ehrenberg, Building Research Station, Watford, Herts., England Library Communication no. 363, December, 1949; reproduced in the United States as "The Influence of a Single Echo on the Audibility of Speech," J. Audio Eng. Soc., Vol. 20 (Mar. 1972), pp. 145-159.)]&lt;/ref&gt; by Helmut Haas in his Ph.D. thesis. It is often equated with the underlying precedence effect.

== History ==

The "law of the first wavefront" was described and named in 1948 by [[Lothar Cremer]].&lt;ref&gt;
Cremer, L. (1948): "Die wissenschaftlichen Grundlagen der Raumakustik", Bd. 1. Hirzel-Verlag Stuttgart.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "precedence effect" was described and named in 1949 by [[Hans Wallach|Wallach et al.]]&lt;ref&gt;Wallach, H., Newman, E. B., &amp; Rosenzweig, M. R. (1949). "The precedence effect in sound localization,"  The American Journal of Psychology, 62, 315–336.&lt;/ref&gt; They showed that when two identical sounds are presented in close succession they will be heard as a single fused sound. In their experiments, fusion occurred when the lag between the two sounds was in the range 1 to 5 ms for clicks, and up to 40 ms for more complex sounds such as speech or piano music.  When the lag was longer, the second sound was heard as an echo.

Additionally, Wallach et al. demonstrated that when successive sounds coming from sources at different locations were heard as fused, the apparent location of the perceived sound was dominated by the location of the sound that reached the ears first (i.e. the first-arriving wavefront).  The second-arriving sound had only a very small (albeit measurable) effect on the perceived location of the fused sound. They designated this phenomenon as the ''precedence effect'', and noted that it explains why sound localization is possible in the typical situation where sounds reverberate from walls, furniture and the like, thus providing multiple, successive stimuli.  They also noted that the precedence effect is an important factor in the perception of stereophonic sound.

Wallach et al. did not systematically vary the intensities of the two sounds, although they cited research by Langmuir et al.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, I., Schaefer, V. J., Ferguson, C. V., &amp; Hennelly, E. F. (1944). "A study of binaural perception of the direction of a sound source,"  OSRD Report 4079, PB number 31014, Office of Technical Services, U. S. Department of Commerce.&lt;/ref&gt; which suggested that if the second-arriving sound is at least 15 dB louder than the first, the precedence effect breaks down.

The "Haas effect" derives from a 1951 paper by Helmut Haas.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, H. (1951). "Uber den Einfluss eines Einfachechos auf die Horsamkeit von Sprache," Acustica, 1, 49–58.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1951 Haas examined how the perception of speech is affected in the presence of a single, coherent [[Sound reflection#Sound reflection|sound reflection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of musical acoustics |author=Arthur H. Benade |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1990 |page=204 |isbn=978-0-486-26484-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; To create [[Anechoic chamber|anechoic]] conditions, the experiment was carried out on the rooftop of a freestanding building. Another test was carried out in a room with a [[reverberation time]] of 1.6 ms. The test signal (recorded speech) was emitted from two similar loudspeakers at locations 45° to the left and to the right  in 3 m distance to the listener.

Haas found that humans  [[Sound localization|localize]] sound sources in the direction of the first arriving sound despite the presence of a single reflection from a different direction. A single [[auditory event]] is perceived. A reflection arriving later than 1 ms after the direct sound increases the perceived level and spaciousness (more precisely the perceived width of the sound source). A single reflection arriving within 5 to 30 ms can be up to 10 dB louder than the direct sound without being perceived as a secondary auditory event ([[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]]). This time span varies with the reflection level. If the direct sound is coming from the same direction the listener is facing, the reflection's direction has no significant effect on the results. A reflection with attenuated higher frequencies expands the time span that [[echo suppression]] is active.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}  Increased room reverberation time also expands the time span of echo suppression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2093 Haas, H. "The Influence of a Single Echo on the Audibility of Speech", JAES Volume 20 Issue 2 pp. 146-159; March 1972]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
The precedence effect appears if the subsequent wave fronts arrive between 2 ms and about 50 ms later than the first wave front. This range is signal dependent. For speech the precedence effect disappears for delays above 50 ms, but for music the precedence effect can also appear for delays of some 100 ms.&lt;ref&gt;
Blauert, J.: Spatial hearing - the psychophysics of human sound localization; MIT Press; Cambridge, Massachusetts (1983), chapter 3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

In two-click lead–lag experiments, localization effects include aspects of ''summing localization'', ''localization dominance'', and ''lag discrimination suppression''.  The last two are generally considered to be aspects of the precedence effect:&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Summing localization: for time delays below 2 ms, listeners only perceive one sound; its direction is between the locations of the lead and lag sounds. An application for summing localization is the [[intensity stereo]]phony, where two loudspeakers emit the same signal with different [[Sound pressure#Sound pressure level|levels]], resulting in the localized sound direction between both loudspeakers. The localized direction depends on the level difference between the loudspeakers.
* Localization dominance: for delays between 2 and 5 ms, listeners also perceive one sound; its location is determined by the location of the leading sound.
* Lag discrimination suppression: for short time delays, listeners are less capable of discriminating the location of the lagging sound.

For time delays above 50 ms (for speech) or some 100 ms (for music) the delayed sound is perceived as an echo of the first-arriving sound. Both sound directions are localized correctly. The time delay for perceiving echoes depends on the signal characteristics. For signals with impulse characteristics, echoes are perceived for delays above 50 ms. For signals with a nearly constant amplitude, the echo threshold can be enhanced up to time differences of 1 to 2 seconds.

A special appearance of the precedence effect is the Haas effect. Haas showed that the precedence effect appears even if the level of the delayed sound is up to 10 dB higher than the level of the first wave front. In this case, the range of delays, where the precedence effect works, is reduced to delays between 10 and 30 ms.

== Applications ==
The precedence effect is important for the hearing in enclosed rooms. With the help of this effect, it remains possible to determine the direction of a sound source (e.g. the direction of a speaker) even in the presence of wall [[Reflection (physics)|reflections]].

===Sound reinforcement systems===
Haas' findings can be applied to [[sound reinforcement system]]s and [[public address]] systems. The signal for loudspeakers placed at distant locations from a stage may be [[Delay (audio effect)#Straight delay|delayed electronically]] by an amount equal to [[speed of sound|the time sound takes to travel through the air]] from the stage to the distant location, plus about 10 to 20 milliseconds and played at a level up to 10&amp;nbsp;dB louder than sound emanating from the stage. The first arrival of sound from the source on stage determines perceived localization whereas the slightly later sound from delayed loudspeakers simply increases the perceived sound level without negatively affecting localization. In this configuration, the listener will localize all sound from the direction of the direct sound, but he will benefit from the higher sound level, which has been enhanced by the loudspeakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti-audio.com/Portals/0/data/en/NTi-Audio-QuickGuide-FOH.pdf|title=How To Setup for a Live Sound Event|first=[[NTi Audio|NTi]]|last=Audio|website=www.nti-audio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambience extraction===
The precedence effect can be employed to increase the perception of ambience during the playback of stereo recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=1481 |title=Extraction of Ambiance Information from Ordinary Recordings |last=Madsen |first=E. Roerbaek |journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society |date=October 1970 |pages=490–496 |volume=18 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; If two speakers are placed to the left and right of the listener (in addition to the main speakers), and fed with the program material delayed by 10 to 20 milliseconds, the random-phase ambience components of the sound will become sufficiently decorrelated that they cannot be localized. This effectively extracts the recording's existing ambience, while leaving its foreground "direct" sounds still appearing to come from the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.stereophile.com/content/extraction-ivsi-generation |title=Extraction vs Generation |journal=Stereophile |last=Katz |first=Bob |date=March 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mastering Audio: The Art and the Science |last=Katz |first=Bob |year=2007 |pages=229–237 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0240808376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multichannel audio decoding ===
The effect was taken into account and exploited in the psychoacoustics of the Fosgate Tate 101A SQ decoder, developed by [[Jim Fosgate]] in consultation with [[Peter Scheiber]] and [[Martin Willcocks]], to produce much better spatiality and directionality in matrix decoding of 4-2-4 &lt;small&gt;([[Quadraphonic sound#SQ / Stereo Quadraphonic|SQ quadraphonic]])&lt;/small&gt; audio.

=== Haas kicker ===
Many older LEDE ("live end, dead end") [[Recording studio|control room]] designs featured so-called "Haas kickers" – reflective panels placed at the rear to create specular reflections which were thought to provide a wider stereo listening area or raise intelligibility.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Patronis "Sound System Engineering", Focal Press; 3 edition (September 20, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; However, what is beneficial for one type of sound is detrimental to others, so Haas kickers, like [[compression ceiling]]s, are no longer commonly found in control rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Newell "Recording Studio Design", Focal Press; 2 edition (December 22, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6417">'''Q-vectors''' are used in atmospheric dynamics to understand physical processes such as vertical motion and [[frontogenesis]]. Q-vectors are not physical quantities that can be measured in the atmosphere but are derived from the [[quasi-geostrophic equations]] and can be used in the previous diagnostic situations. On meteorological charts, Q-vectors point toward upward motion and away from downward motion.  Q-vectors are an alternative to the [[omega equation]] for diagnosing vertical motion in the quasi-geostrophic equations.

==Derivation==
First derived in 1978,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoskins|first=B. J. |author2=I. Draghici |author3=H. C. Davies|title=A new look at the ω-equation|journal=Quart. J. R. Met. Soc|year=1978|volume=104|pages=31–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Q-vector derivation can be simplified for the midlatitudes, using the midlatitude β-plane quasi-geostrophic prediction equations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holton|first=James R.|title=An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Academic|location=New York|isbn=0-12-354015-1|pages=168–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# &lt;math&gt; \frac{D_g u_g}{Dt} - f_{0}v_a - \beta y v_g = 0 &lt;/math&gt; (x component of quasi-geostrophic momentum equation)
# &lt;math&gt; \frac{D_g v_g}{Dt} + f_{0}u_a + \beta y u_g = 0 &lt;/math&gt; (y component of quasi-geostrophic momentum equation)
# &lt;math&gt; \frac{D_g T}{Dt} - \frac{\sigma p}{R} \omega = \frac{J}{c_p} &lt;/math&gt; (quasi-geostrophic thermodynamic equation)

And the [[thermal wind]] equations:

&lt;math&gt; f_{0} \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial p} = \frac{R}{p} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} &lt;/math&gt; (x component of thermal wind equation)

&lt;math&gt; f_{0} \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial p} = - \frac{R}{p} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} &lt;/math&gt; (y component of thermal wind equation)

where &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Coriolis parameter]], approximated by the constant 1e&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the atmospheric [[ideal gas constant]]; &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; is the latitudinal change in the Coriolis parameter &lt;math&gt; \beta = \frac{\partial f} {\partial y} &lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; is a static stability parameter; &lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat]] at constant pressure; &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is pressure; &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is temperature; anything with a subscript &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; indicates [[geostrophic]]; anything with a subscript &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; indicates [[ageostrophic]]; &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is a diabatic heating rate; and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the Lagrangian rate change of pressure with time. &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{Dp}{Dt}&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that because pressure decreases with height in the atmosphere, a &lt;math&gt; - \omega &lt;/math&gt; is upward vertical motion, analogous to &lt;math&gt;+w=\frac{Dz}{Dt}&lt;/math&gt;.

From these equations we can get expressions for the Q-vector:

&lt;math&gt; Q_i = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \left[ \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial x} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial x} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \right] &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Q_j = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \left[ \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial y} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial y} \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \right] &lt;/math&gt;

And in vector form:

&lt;math&gt; Q_i = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \frac{\partial \vec{V_g}}{\partial x} \cdot \vec{\nabla} T &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; Q_j = - \frac{R}{\sigma p} \frac{\partial \vec{V_g}}{\partial y} \cdot \vec{\nabla} T &lt;/math&gt;

Plugging these Q-vector equations into the [[omega equation|quasi-geostrophic omega equation]] gives:

&lt;math&gt; \left(\sigma \overrightarrow{\nabla^2} + f_{\circ}^2 \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial p^2} \right) \omega = -2 \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{Q} + f_{\circ} \beta \frac{\partial v_g}{\partial p} - \frac{\kappa}{p} \overrightarrow{\nabla^2} J &lt;/math&gt;

Which in an adiabatic setting gives:

&lt;math&gt; -\omega \propto -2 \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{Q} &lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the left-hand side of the quasi-geostrophic omega equation in a [[Fourier Series]] gives the &lt;math&gt; -\omega &lt;/math&gt; above, implying that a &lt;math&gt; -\omega &lt;/math&gt; relationship with the right-hand side of the [[omega equation|quasi-geostrophic omega equation]] can be assumed.

This expression shows that the divergence of the Q-vector (&lt;math&gt; \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{Q} &lt;/math&gt;) is associated with downward motion. Therefore, convergent &lt;math&gt; \vec{Q} &lt;/math&gt; forces ascend and divergent &lt;math&gt; \vec{Q} &lt;/math&gt; forces descend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holton|first=James R.|title=An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Academic|location=New York|isbn=0-12-354015-1|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Q-vectors and all [[ageostrophic]] flow exist to preserve [[thermal wind]] balance. Therefore, low level Q-vectors tend to point in the direction of low-level ageostrophic winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewitt|first=C. N.|title=Handbook of atmospheric science: principles and applications|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-632-05286-4|pages=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Q-vectors can be determined wholly with: [[geopotential height]] (&lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt;) and temperature on a constant pressure surface. Q-vectors always point in the direction of ascending air. For an idealized cyclone and anticyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (where &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial T} {\partial y} &lt;0 &lt;/math&gt;), cyclones have Q-vectors which point parallel to the thermal wind and anticyclones have Q-vectors that point antiparallel to the thermal wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holton|first=James R.|title=An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Academic|location=New York|isbn=0-12-354015-1|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means upward motion in the area of warm air advection and downward motion in the area of cold air advection.

In [[frontogenesis]], temperature gradients need to tighten for initiation. For those situations Q-vectors point toward ascending air and the tightening thermal gradients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Weather Service|first=Jet Stream - Online School for Weather|title=Glossary: Q's|url=http://www.srh.weather.gov/jetstream/append/glossary_q.htm|work=NOAA - NWS|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas of convergent Q-vectors, cyclonic vorticity is created, and in divergent areas, anticyclonic vorticity is created.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8822">[[Image:Red_Rose_Badge_of_Lancaster.svg|thumb|Lancashire Rose, the [[heraldic device]] of the [[House of Lancaster]]]]
The '''Red Rose of Lancaster''' (a [[rose (heraldry)|rose]] gules) is the [[county flower]] of [[Lancashire]].

The exact [[species]] or [[cultivar]] which the red rose relates to is uncertain, but it is thought to be ''[[Rosa gallica|Rosa gallica officinalis]]''.

The rose was first adopted as an heraldic device by the first [[Edmund Crouchback|Earl of Lancaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Bedingfeld and Peter Gwynn-Jones, Heraldry, Chartwell Books, 1993, page 130.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the badges of [[Henry IV of England]], the first king of the [[House of Lancaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Bedingfeld and Peter Gwynn-Jones, Heraldry, Chartwell Books, 1993, page 127.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] in 1485, it became the emblem of Lancashire.

==Flower==
[[Image:Rosa gallica officinalis0.jpg|thumb|''Rosa gallica'' var. ''officinalis'']]
{{Main|Rosa gallica}}

Lancaster's Red Rose (also known as [[Apothecary's Rose]], Old Red Damask and Rose of Provins) is an official variety and is possibly the first cultivated [[rose]]. The rose grew wild throughout [[Central Asia]] and was discovered by the ancient [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]. Later adopted by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], who introduced it to [[Gaul]] (France) where it assumed the name ''[[Rosa gallica]]''. It is documented that [[Charlemagne]]'s court exploited the rose as a [[perfume]]. The rose was also appreciated for its medical value and was utilized in countless [[medicinal plants|medical remedies]].

==Medieval symbol==
[[Image:Tudor Rose.svg|thumb|100px|left|The Tudor Rose of England]] The Red Rose of Lancaster derives from the gold rose badge of [[Edward I of England]].  Other members of his family used variants of the royal badge, with the king's brother, the Earl of Lancaster, using a red rose.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Bedingfeld and Peter Gwynn-Jones, Heraldry, Chartwell Books, 1993, page 130.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed that the Red Rose of Lancaster was the [[House of Lancaster]]'s [[Heraldic badge|badge]] during the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Evidence for this "wearing of the rose" includes land tenure records requiring service of a red rose yearly for a manor held directly from [[Henry VI of England]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Cardogan Rothery, Concise Encyclopedia of Heraldry, Brackten Books, 1915, page 183&lt;/ref&gt;  There are, however, doubts as to whether the red rose was actually an emblem taken up by the Lancastrians during the Wars of the Roses.  Adrian Ailes has noted that the red rose “probably owes its popular usage to [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] quickly responding to the pre-existing Yorkist white rose in an age when signs and symbols could speak louder than words."  
  
It also  allowed Henry to invent and exploit his most famous heraldic device, the [[Tudor Rose]], combining the so-called Lancastrian red rose and the [[White Rose of York]].  This floral union neatly symbolised the restoration of peace and harmony and his marriage in January 1486 to Elizabeth of York.  It was a brilliant piece of simple heraldic propaganda.”&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Ailes, “Heraldry in Medieval England: Symbols of Politics and Propaganda,” in Heraldry, Pageantry, and Social Display in Medieval England, ed. Peter Cross and Maurice Keen (Woodbridge, Suffolk: Boydell, 2002), 83-104 (101).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tudor Rose]] is used as the plant badge of England ([[Scotland]] uses the [[thistle]], [[Ireland]] uses the [[shamrock]], and [[Wales]] uses the [[leek]]).

==Later use==

[[Image:Coat of arms of Lancashire County Council.png|thumb|190px|Lancashire's official coat of arms has three red roses]]

The rose does not form any part of the insignia of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], but came to be seen as an emblem of the [[county]] of [[Lancashire]], and as such was incorporated in the [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] of numerous Lancashire local authorities including the county council. Since 1974 a number of [[metropolitan boroughs]] in [[Greater Manchester]] and [[Merseyside]] have included red roses in their armorial bearings to show their formation from parts of Lancashire. It is also present in the crest of the [[coat of arms of the London Borough of Enfield]].

The traditional [[Flag of Lancashire|Lancashire flag]], a red rose on a white field, was never officially registered with the Flag Institute and when this was attempted it was found that this flag had been registered by the town of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose, Scotland]]. As two flags of the same design can not be registered, Lancashire’s official flag is now registered as a red rose on a yellow field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.flaginstitute.org/index.php?location=10&amp;flagtype=county&amp;flagid=108 | title = UK Flag Institute | access-date =April 8, 2017 | publisher =  The Flag Institute | language = English }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.lep.co.uk/news/lancashire-flag-is-all-yellow-1-76611 | title = Lancashire flag is all yellow | date=July 29, 2008 | access-date =May 11, 2017 | publisher = Johnston Publishing Ltd. | language = English }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the Red Rose is still widely used, and not necessarily on a yellow background. [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] still use the rose as an emblem. [[The Trafford Centre]] also features Red Roses in its architecture, most noticeably on all of the glass panes in the shopping centre. [[Lancashire GAA]] features a red rose on its emblem. [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City Football Club]] featured the red rose on the club badge from 1972 to 1997 and reinstated it in 2015, reflecting Manchester's history as part of Lancashire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-35174237|title=Manchester City's new club badge design leaked online|publisher=BBC News|date=24 December 2015|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also features on the badge of [[Blackburn Rovers]] and [[Bolton Wanderers]].
[[Edge Hill University]] in Ormskirk uses the Red Rose on a yellow background on its crest along with a [[Liver bird]] which signifies its current location (Lancashire) and origins in Liverpool. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Mike |last=Nolan |title=The coat of arms |url=http://blogs.edgehill.ac.uk/125by125/logos/the-coat-of-arms/ |work=125 by 125. 125 posts from the archives right through to Edge Hill's 125th year |date=February 21, 2010 | accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shield of Lancashire County Council's [[coat of arms]], however, displays not one but three red roses, on gold [[Pile (heraldry)|piles]] on a red background. The arms have been official since 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Lancashire|title=Lancashire|publisher=Heraldry of the World|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military use==
From the nineteenth century the red rose was part of the badge of a number of units of the [[British Army]] recruiting in the county. In [[World War I]] the rose was worn by [[British 55th (West Lancashire) Division]] during their campaign in [[Belgium]]; their [[motto]] was "They win or die, who wear the Rose of Lancaster". The cap badge of the [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's Lancashire and Border)|Duke of Lancaster's Regiment]], formed in 2006, features the rose.

The Saskatoon [[Light Infantry]] of the [[Canadian Army]] also incorporated the red rose into the design of their cap badge and regimental buttons, due to an alliance with the [[York and Lancaster Regiment]] of the [[British Army]].

'''Reporter's privilege''' in the [[United States]] (also '''journalist's privilege,''' '''newsman's privilege,''' or '''press privilege'''), is a "reporter's protection under constitutional or statutory law, from being compelled to testify about confidential information or sources."&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'', West Publishing-Thomson Reuters (9th ed. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; It may be described in the US as the qualified (limited) [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] or statutory right many jurisdictions have given to journalists in protecting their confidential sources from [[discovery (law)|discovery]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexmedia.com.au/2010/10/journalist-shield-laws.html|title=LexMedia|work=lexmedia.com.au|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907140217/http://www.lexmedia.com.au/2010/10/journalist-shield-laws.html|archivedate=2015-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the recent case of ''[[U.S. v. Sterling]]'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth]] expressly denied a reporter's privilege exists under ''Branzburg''. Furthermore, forty states and the District of Columbia have enacted statutes called [[shield law]]s protecting journalists' [[Protection of sources|anonymous sources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcfp.org/browse-media-law-resources/news-media-law/news-media-and-law-summer-2011/number-states-shield-law-cl|title=Number of states with shield law climbs to 40|work=rcfp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
=== Department of Justice guidelines (United States) ===

The [[United States Department of Justice]] created self-imposed guidelines intended to protect the [[news media]] by regulating the use of subpoenas against the press. These guidelines state that the government "should have made all reasonable attempts to obtain the information from alternative, non-media sources” before considering issuing a [[subpoena]] to a member of the news media.&lt;ref&gt;28 C.F.R. § 50.10(c)(4)(iii).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the guidelines require that federal prosecutors negotiate with the press, explaining the specific needs of the case.

Before any subpoena may be issued, the attorney general must approve the issuance.  The attorney general’s review for a subpoena to a member of the news media shall be based on the following criteria:
* In criminal cases, there should be reasonable grounds to believe, based on information obtained from non-media sources, that a crime has occurred, and that the information sought is essential to a successful investigation—particularly with reference to directly establishing guilt or innocence. The subpoena should not be used to obtain peripheral, nonessential, or speculative information.
* In civil cases there should be reasonable grounds, based on non-media sources, to believe that the information sought is essential to the successful completion of the litigation in a case of substantial importance. The subpoena should not be used to obtain peripheral, nonessential, or speculative information.
* The government should have unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the information from alternative non-media sources.
* The use of subpoenas to members of the news media should, except under exigent circumstances, be limited to the verification of published information and to such surrounding circumstances as relate to the accuracy of the published information.
* Even subpoena authorization requests for publicly disclosed information should be treated with care to avoid claims of harassment.
* Subpoenas should, wherever possible, be directed at material information regarding a limited subject matter, should cover a reasonably limited period of time, and should avoid requiring production of a large volume of unpublished material. They should give reasonable and timely notice of the demand for documents.

While these guidelines seem extremely protective of the press, they explicitly deny the creation of “any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law.”&lt;ref name="28 C.F.R. 50.10n"&gt;28 C.F.R. § 50.10(j).&lt;/ref&gt; Nor does the policy have any substantive punishment for the federal government violations. If the federal prosecutors fail to obtain approval from the attorney general, the extent of the authorized punishment is “an administrative reprimand or other appropriate disciplinary action.”&lt;ref&gt;28 C.F.R. § 50.10(i).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some courts have found that the guidelines “create no enforceable right.”&lt;ref&gt;In re: Miller, 397 F.3d 964, 975 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (The appellant journalists claimed that the contempt charges should be reversed because the justice department had not complied with the guidelines issuing subpoenas to news media. Because the circuit court found that the guidelines did not create an enforceable right, it found no reason to determine the issue of compliance).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in circuits taking this approach, the news media have no right to appeal for enforcement of these policies before being compelled to testify.

=== Judith Miller's attempted use of reporter's privilege ===
The issue of a reporter's privilege came to the forefront of media attention in the 2005 case'' In re Miller'', involving reporters [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]] and [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)|Matthew Cooper]]. Miller and Cooper were both served with grand jury subpoenas for testimony and information, including notes and documents pertaining to conversations with specific and all other official sources relating the [[Plame affair]]. Both refused to submit to the subpoenas, claiming a reporter’s privilege.&lt;ref&gt;In re Miller, 397 F.3d 964, 966-68 (D.C. Cir. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal district court held both Miller and Cooper in civil [[contempt of court]], and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] upheld the orders of contempt.

Miller and Cooper, in their appeal to the appellate court pleaded several defenses including a First Amendment reporter’s privilege and a common law reporter’s privilege.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 967. Miller and Cooper also put forward a due process defense and a defense based on guidelines for the Justice Department that are codified at 28 C.F.R. § 50.10 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The appellate court rejected both the First Amendment and common law claims for privilege. The court held Miller and Cooper in civil contempt of court and sentenced both to eighteen months of jail time. The sentence was stayed pending an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] refused to hear the case.  Judith Miller began serving the remaining four months of the original eighteen-month sentence on July 6, 2005. Matthew Cooper’s confidential source released him from their confidentiality agreement, so he chose to comply with the subpoena and has agreed to testify before the grand jury.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Liptak and Maria Newman, ''New York Times Reporter Jailed for Keeping Source Secret'', [https://www.nytimes.com The New York Times], July 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congressional proposals ===
In 2004, two significant bills were introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and in the [[United States Senate]] to create a federal shield law. The first bill was introduced in identical form in both the Senate and the House by Senator [[Richard Lugar]] (R-IN) and Representative [[Mike Pence]] (R-IN).&lt;ref&gt;H.R. 581 (Free Flow of Information Act of 2005). This bill was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. See also S. 340 (Free Flow of Information Act of 2005) (referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary).&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Christopher Dodd]] introduced separate legislation that created a seemingly broader protection than the Pence/Lugar bill.&lt;ref&gt;S. 369. Sen. Dodd introduced the same bill in the 2004 congressional session. It was not acted on before the Senate adjourned. ''See'' S. 3020, 108th Congress, 2nd Sess. (2004); ''see also'' ''Second shield bill introduced in U.S. Senate'', [http://www.rcfp.org/news/2005/0217-con-second.html http://www.rcfp.org/news/2005/0217-con-second.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Rodney A. Smolla]] testified before the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] on the topic of reporter's privilege.

On December 2, 2010, in a reaction to the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] by [[WikiLeaks]], [[John Ensign]] (R-NV) introduced S.4004 to amend section 798 of title 18, United States Code, to provide penalties for disclosure of classified information related to certain intelligence activities and for other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|S|4004}}&lt;/ref&gt; While titled the SHIELD Act, the proposed legislation has little in common with [[shield laws in the United States]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21418">The '''right to disconnect''' is a proposed [[human right]] regarding the ability of people to disconnect from work and primarily not to engage in work-related electronic communications such as e-mails or messages during non-work hours.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staufenberg|first1=Jess|title=France may pass a law on the 'right to disconnect' from work emails at home|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-may-pass-a-law-on-right-to-disconnect-from-work-emails-at-home-a6878571.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schofield|first1=Hugh|title=The plan to ban work emails out of hours|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36249647|website=BBC News|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern working environment has been drastically changed by new communication and information technologies. The boundary between work life and home life has shrunk with the introduction of digital tools into employment. While digital tools bring flexibility and freedom to employees they also can create an absence of limits, leading to excessive interference in the private lives of employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soulier-avocats.com/en/is-the-right-to-disconnect-about-to-become-an-effective-right-for-employees-in-france/|title=Is the right to disconnect about to become an effective right for employees in France? - Soulier AARPI|last=Ducorops-Prouvost|first=Emilie|date=December 2016|website=www.soulier-avocats.com|page=1|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason such a right is beneficial. Several countries, primarily in [[Europe]], have some form of the right to disconnect included in their law, while in some cases it is present in the policy of many large companies. On July 24, 2018, the Petition 1057 called for introduction of the right to disconnect or as it is called in French “Le droit à la déconnexion” in the Labour Law in Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chd.lu/wps/portal/public/Accueil/TravailALaChambre/Petitions/RoleDesPetitions?action=doPetitionDetail&amp;id=1249|title=Petition 1057|last=|first=|date=|website=Chambre des députés du Grand Duché du Luxembourg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== France ==

=== Origins ===
The right to disconnect emerged in [[France]] in a decision in the Labour Chamber of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|French Supreme Court]]. The decision on 2 October 2001 held that "the employee is under no obligation either to accept working at home or to bring there his files and working tools".&lt;ref&gt;Labor Chamber of the Cour de Cassation, October 2, 2001 n°99-42.727&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the Supreme Court affirmed this decision and ruled that "the fact that [the employee] was not reachable on his cell phone outside working hours cannot be considered as misconduct."&lt;ref&gt;Labor Chamber of the Cour de Cassation, February 17, 2004 n°01-45.889&lt;/ref&gt;

=== El Khomri Law ===
The [[government of France]] passed the [[El Khomri law]] to reform working conditions for French people. Article 55 under Chapter II "Adapting the Labour Law to the Digital Age" (&lt;span lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;''Adaptation du droit du travail à l'ère du numérique''&lt;/span&gt;) included a provision to amend the [[French labour law|French Labour Code]] to include the right to disconnect (''&lt;span lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;le droit de la déconnexion&lt;/span&gt;)''. Article 55(1) amended Article L. 2242-8 of the Labour Code by adding a paragraph (7);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/loi/2016/8/8/ETSX1604461L/jo#JORFSCTA000032983228|title=LOI n° 2016-1088 du 8 août 2016 relative au travail, à la modernisation du dialogue social et à la sécurisation des parcours professionnels {{!}} Legifrance|website=www.legifrance.gouv.fr|language=fr|access-date=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"(7) The procedures for the full exercise by the employee of his right to disconnect and the establishment by the company of mechanisms for regulating the use of digital tools, with a view to ensuring respect for rest periods and leave as well as personal and family life. Failing agreement, the employer shall draw up a charter, after consultation with the works council or, failing that, with the staff delegates. This charter defines these procedures for the exercise of the right to disconnect and furthermore provides for the implementation, for employees and management and management personnel, of training and awareness-raising activities on the reasonable use of digital tools."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''&lt;span lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;"7° Les modalités du plein exercice par le salarié de son droit à la déconnexion et la mise en place par l'entreprise de dispositifs de régulation de l'utilisation des outils numériques, en vue d'assurer le respect des temps de repos et de congé ainsi que de la vie personnelle et familiale. A défaut d'accord, l'employeur élabore une charte, après avis du comité d'entreprise ou, à défaut, des délégués du personnel. Cette charte définit ces modalités de l'exercice du droit à la déconnexion et prévoit en outre la mise en œuvre, à destination des salariés et du personnel d'encadrement et de direction, d'actions de formation et de sensibilisation à un usage raisonnable des outils numériques"&lt;/span&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt; As prescribed in Article 55(2), Article 55(1) entered into force on January 1, 2017.

=== Context ===
The government of France adopted the right into its Labour Code in response to a September 2015 report on the impact of digital technologies on labour which supported a right to "professional disconnection".&lt;ref name="Droit à la déconnexion"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://travail-emploi.gouv.fr/archives/archives-courantes/loi-travail-2016/les-principales-mesures-de-la-loi-travail/article/droit-a-la-deconnexion|title=Droit à la déconnexion|date=2017-05-31|work=Ministère du Travail|access-date=2017-09-10|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was presented to the French Minister of Labour [[Myriam El Khomri]] after the previous minister sought information on the effect of digital transformation on Labour.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/var/storage/rapports-publics/154000646.pdf|title=Report on Digital Transformation and Work Life|last=Mettling|first=Bruno|date=September 2015|website=|page=52|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report recommended such a measure stating that a correct balance between work and private life is essential to allow digital transformation to have a positive effect on workers' quality of life and that knowing how to disconnect was a skill which needs to be supported by employers. The report identified cognitive and emotional overload which can lead to a sense of fatigue as a psycho-social risk of being constantly connected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The government viewed it necessary to adopt such a law to adapt to the changing nature of the workplace, recognizing that digital technologies have blurred the line between work and private lives. It viewed the introduction of the right to disconnect necessary for the health of French employees.&lt;ref name="Droit à la déconnexion"/&gt;

The introduction of this law followed a 2016 study that discovered that 37% of workers were using professional digital tools (e.g. work mobile phones) outside of work hours and that 62% of workers wanted more controls and rules to regulate this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eleas.fr/app/uploads/2016/10/CP-Eleas-Enqu%C3%AAte-Pratiques-num%C3%A9riques-2016.pdf|title=Digital Asset Practices in France in 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application ===
The right to disconnect is applied to each company in its own way. The El Khomri Law introduces the right but does not define it, allowing companies to choose the most practical ways to implement the right taking into consideration the nature of the business (for example, whether it operates with countries in foreign time zones, or whether the employees work nights or in the weekend).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bersay-associes.com/en/2017-01/the-right-to-disconnect/|title=The right to disconnect {{!}} Bersay Associés|website=www.bersay-associes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For companies with more than 50 employees the right is to be included in their Mandatory Annual Negotiation (MAN) on gender equality and the nature of quality of life at work, that is already required by the El Khomri Law, by considering ways in which the use of digital tools can be regulated and the means to do this.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the absence of this a "charter of good conduct" is to be negotiated with union representatives detailing the times that employees can disconnect from their digital tools, when they would not be expected to connected to their smartphones or laptops.  Companies with less than 50 employees are expected to release a document to their employees outlining the rules for their company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/key-measures-in-france-s-contested-labour-reform-1.2900757|title=Key measures in France's contested labour reform|date=2016-05-13|work=CTVNews|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right as it exists in the El Khomri Law does not extend to those independent workers who are part of online [[Crowdsourcing|crowdworking]] regimes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Donini Forlivesi Rota Tullini|first=Annamaria Michele Anna Patrizia|date=2017|title=Janus and the trade union challenge of digital technology|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1024258916688863#_i11|journal=Transfer: European Review of Labour and Research|volume=23 |issue=2|pages=207–223|via=SAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law does not provide any guidance on possible ways to manage the use of digital tools or ways to train or raise awareness among workers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, while the new law imposes an obligation for large companies to negotiate there is no obligation to reach an agreement, therefore if no agreement is reached between company and employees the right cannot be applied and enforced. It is assumed that the obligation that applies to small companies, for employers to draw up a charter, would then apply. Again there is no penalty for companies who do not do this. Furthermore, such a charter has no legal value in France, unless it contains terms providing or sanctions against employees which allow it to be considered as an appendix to the internal rules of a company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soulier-avocats.com/en/is-the-right-to-disconnect-about-to-become-an-effective-right-for-employees-in-france/|title=Is the right to disconnect about to become an effective right for employees in France? - Soulier AARPI|last=Ducorps-Prouvost|first=Emilie|date=|website=www.soulier-avocats.com|page=1|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers who fail to include the right to disconnect in the MAN are liable to criminal prosecution for obstructing the exercise of union rights, punishable by 1 year in prison and a €3,750 fine.&lt;ref&gt;Article L.2243-2 of the French Labor Code&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As an example for other countries ===
It is likely that other [[European Union]] nations will follow the example of France and enact a similar law themselves. Outside of a formalized right it is likely that employees and unions could negotiate for similar provisions to apply the right to disconnect to their own workplace, resulting in the right becoming commonplace by human resource management best practice, industry practice, or contractual norms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Germany ==
While not having actual laws relating to the right to disconnect, [[Germany|German]] companies have a history of implementing policies to the same effect.

[[Volkswagen]] implemented a policy in 2011 stating that it would stop email servers from sending emails to the mobile phones of employees between 6pm and 7am. Other German companies such as [[Allianz]], Telekom, [[Bayer]] and [[Henkel]] all have similar policies in place to limit the amount of digital connection employees have after work hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalhrlaw.com/resources/anti-stress-legislation-in-germany--how-realistic-is-the-prospect|title=Anti-stress legislation in Germany – how realistic is the prospect? - Ius Laboris Knowledge Base|last=Verhoek|first=Corinna|date=30 September 2014|website=www.globalhrlaw.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Germany's employment ministry banned its managers from contacting staff after hours as part of a wider agreement on remote working. It was done in order to protect the mental health of workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10276815/Out-of-hours-working-banned-by-German-labour-ministry.html|title=Out of hours working banned by German labour ministry|last=Vasagar|first=Jeevan|date=30 August 2013|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-09-10|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, automobile company [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] introduced a software called "Mail on Holiday" that its employees could use to automatically delete incoming emails while they were on vacation. This was done to allow Daimler's employees the opportunity to get a break and come back to work refreshed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3116424/daimler-vacation-email-out-of-office/|title=The most radical way to end vacation email overload ever|last=Gibson|first=Megan|website=Time|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German employment minister in 2014, [[Andrea Nahles]], sought to introduce "anti-stress legislation" in response to the rising levels of stress and mental health issues in Germany. Such legislation would ban companies from making contact with employees out of work hours. Nahles commissioned the [[Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] to produce a report researching mental health in the work place and the viability of legislation to target it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/29/germany-anti-stress-law-ban-on-emails-out-of-office-hours|title=German minister calls for anti-stress law ban on emails out of office hours|last=Stuart|first=Keith|date=2014-08-29|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was completed and published in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baua.de/EN/Service/Publications/Report/Mental-Health.html|title=BAuA  -  Publications - Mental Health in the Working World - Determining the current state of scientific evidence|last=publisher|website=www.baua.de|language=en|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Italy ==
The right to disconnect has recently entered [[Italy|Italian]] law through Senate Act no 2233-B "Measures to safeguard non-entrepreneurial self-employment and measures to facilitate flexible articulation in times and places of subordinate employment". Article 19(1) of the Act governs the implementation for an Agreement on Aggregate Work and includes some form of the right to disconnect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.senato.it/japp/bgt/showdoc/17/DDLMESS/1022243/index.html|title=senato.it - Legislatura 17ª - Disegno di legge n. 2233-B|website=www.senato.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Agreement on Aggregate Work shall be stipulated in writing for the purpose of administrative and probative regularity and shall govern the performance of the work performed outside the premises of the company, including with regard to the forms of exercise of the executive power the employer and the tools used by the worker. ''The agreement also identifies the worker's rest periods as well as the technical and organizational measures necessary to ensure that the worker is disconnected from the technological equipment''." [emphasis added]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span lang="it" dir="ltr"&gt;''"L'accordo relativo alla modalità di lavoro agile è stipulato per iscritto ai fini della regolarità amministrativa e della prova, e disciplina l'esecuzione della prestazione lavorativa svolta all'esterno dei locali aziendali, anche con riguardo alle forme di esercizio del potere direttivo del datore di lavoro ed agli strumenti utilizzati dal lavoratore. L'accordo individua altresì i tempi di riposo del lavoratore nonché le misure tecniche e organizzative necessarie per assicurare la disconnessione del lavoratore dalle strumentazioni tecnologiche di lavoro."''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Philippines ==
House Bill 4721 was introduced to the [[Congress of the Philippines|Seventeenth Congress]] of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]] in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HB04721.pdf|title=H.B 4721|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long title of the proposed Act is "An act granting employees the right to disconnect from work-related electronic communications after work hours" and seeks to amend the Labour Code of the Philippines (Presidential Decree No.442).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1974/pd_442_1974.html|title=P.D. No. 442|website=www.lawphil.net|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly it aims to make time spent engaging with work-related electronic tools outside of work hours come under the definition of 'hours worked' under Article 48, secondly it would insert Articles 48-A and 48-B which read;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Right to disconnect -- An employee shall not be reprimanded, punished, or otherwise subjected to disciplinary action if he or she disregards a work-related communication sent after work-hours, subject to the terms and conditions of the policy to be established by the employer as required in Article 84-B hereof"&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Policy on after-hours use of technology -- It shall be the duty of every employer to establish the hours when employees are not supposed to send or answer work-related e-mails, texts, or calls. The employer shall determine the conditions and exemptions therefrom, subject to such rules and regulations as the Secretary of Labor and Employment may provide"&lt;/blockquote&gt;This bill has already begun to take effect. In February 2017 the Department of Labour and Employment in the Philippines stated that employees have a right to disconnect from work after hours by disregarding work-related communications without facing discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/workers-right-disconnect-dole/310057/|title=Workers have right to ‘disconnect’ - DOLE - The Manila Times Online|website=www.manilatimes.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill has received the support of the General Alliance of Workers Association (GAWA), a labour group in the Philippines. GAWA particularly supports the amendment to Article 48 calling it undeclared labour. GAWA cited the dangers of constant connection as a reason why the bill should pass, referring to the risk of burning or physical and mental stress caused by inability to rest. Additionally they pointed out that employers would see benefits as their employees would be more productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/bacolod/business/2017/02/03/labor-group-supports-workers-right-disconnect-523687|title=Labor group supports workers’ ‘right to disconnect’|last=Nicavera|first=Erwin P.|date=2017-02-03|work=SunStar|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Links to existing international human rights ==
The right to disconnect shares similarities with several preexisting human rights. The most notable of these is the right to rest and leisure found in article 24 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|UDHR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ichrp.org/en/article_24_udhr|title=Article 24|website=www.ichrp.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This right explicitly places limitations on the amount of time people can work for, something that the right to disconnect takes further and places into the modern age. The right to disconnect also crosses into the article 23 of the UDHR, that everyone has the right to work and receive fair remuneration and to join trade unions to protect their interests.

The [[International Labour Organization]] is also a relevant source of measures and rights supplementary to the right to disconnect. A recent study endorsed by the ILO has affirmed the need for workers to be able to disconnect from technology in order to avoid the blurring of the lines between work life and personal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_544108/lang--en/index.htm|title=New report highlights opportunities and challenges of expanding telework|date=2017-02-15|access-date=2017-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shareholder rights plan''', colloquially known as a "'''poison pill'''", is a type of defensive tactic used by a [[corporation]]'s [[board of directors]] against a [[takeover]]. Typically, such a plan gives shareholders the right to buy more shares at a discount if one shareholder buys a certain percentage or more of the company's shares. The plan could be triggered, for instance, if any one shareholder buys 20% of the company's shares, at which point every shareholder (except the one who possesses 20%) will have the right to buy a new issue of shares at a discount. If every other shareholder is able to buy more shares at a discount, such purchases would dilute the bidder's interest, and the cost of the bid would rise substantially. Knowing that such a plan could be activated, the bidder could be disinclined to take over the corporation without the board's approval, and would first negotiate with the board in order to revoke the plan.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of a standard rights plan, see [[Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz]], ''The Share Purchase Rights Plan'' in Ronald J. Gilson &amp; Bernard S. Black, The Law and Finance of Corporate Acquisitions (2d ed. Supp. 1999) at 10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan can be issued by the board of directors as an "[[option (finance)|option]]" or a "[[warrant (finance)|warrant]]" attached to existing shares, and only be revoked at the discretion of the board.

In the field of [[mergers and acquisitions]], shareholder rights plans were devised in the early 1980s as a way to prevent takeover bidders from negotiating a price for sale of shares directly with shareholders, and instead forcing the bidder to negotiate with the board.

==History==
The poison pill was invented by [[mergers and acquisitions]] lawyer [[Martin Lipton]] of [[Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz]] in 1982, as a response to tender-based [[hostile takeovers]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business School, Case Study 9-496-037, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Poison pills became popular during the early 1980s in response to the wave of takeovers by [[corporate raid]]ers such as [[Carl Icahn]]. The term "poison pill" derives its original meaning from a [[suicide pill|poison pill]] physically carried by various [[Espionage|spies]] throughout history, a pill which was taken by the spies when they were discovered to eliminate the possibility of being interrogated by an enemy.

It was reported in 2001 that since 1997, for every company with a poison pill which successfully resisted a hostile takeover, there were 20 companies with poison pills that accepted takeover offers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3001307/2/c_3046510?f=insidecfo Poison Pill Popping - CFO Magazine - October 2001 Issue - CFO.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The trend since the early 2000s has been for shareholders to vote against poison pill authorization, since poison pills are designed to resist takeovers, whereas from the point of view of a shareholder, takeovers can be financially rewarding.

Some have argued that poison pills are detrimental to shareholder interests because they perpetuate existing management. For instance, [[Microsoft]] originally made an unsolicited bid for [[Yahoo!]], but subsequently dropped the bid after Yahoo! CEO [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] threatened to make the takeover as difficult as possible unless Microsoft raised the price to US$37 per share. One Microsoft executive commented, "They are going to burn the furniture if we go hostile. They are going to destroy the place." Yahoo has had a shareholders rights plan in place since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo weighs up options|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6445d618-d293-11dc-8636-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1|publisher=''[[Financial Times]]''|accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts suggested that Microsoft's raised offer of $33 per share was already too expensive, and that Yang was not bargaining in good faith, which later led to several shareholder lawsuits and an aborted proxy fight from [[Carl Icahn]].&lt;ref name="msft_withdrawl1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Withdraws Proposal to Acquire Yahoo!|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/may08/05-03letter.mspx|publisher=''[[Microsoft]]''|accessdate=2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Microsoft's Failed Yahoo Bid Risks Online Growth|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/05/technology/05soft.html?_r=4&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|accessdate=2008-05-06 | first=Steve | last=Lohr | date=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yahoo's stock price plunged after Microsoft withdrew the bid, and Jerry Yang faced a backlash from stockholders that eventually led to his resignation.

==Overview==
In publicly held companies, "poison pills" refer to various methods to deter [[takeover]] bids.  Takeover bids are attempts by a bidder to obtain control of a target company, either by [[proxy fight|soliciting proxies]] to get elected to the board or by acquiring a controlling block of shares and using the associated votes to get elected to the board.  Once in control of the board, the bidder can manage the target. As discussed below, targets have various takeover defenses available, and several types of defense have been called "poison pills" because they harm not only the bidder, but the target (or its shareholders) as well. Currently, the most common type of takeover defense is a shareholder rights plan.

Because the [[board of directors]] of the company can redeem or otherwise eliminate a standard poison pill, it does not typically preclude a [[proxy fight]] or other takeover attempts not accompanied by an acquisition of a significant block of the company's stock.  It can, however, prevent shareholders from entering into certain agreements that can assist in a proxy fight, such as an agreement to pay another shareholder's expenses.  In combination with a [[staggered board of directors]], however, a shareholder rights plan can be a defense.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |last=Bebchuk |first=Lucian |authorlink=Lucian Bebchuk |author2=Coates, John C. |author3=Subramanian, Guhan  |year=2002 |title=The Powerful Antitakeover Force of Staggered Boards: Theory, Evidence, and Policy |journal=[[Stanford Law Review]] |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=887–951  |jstor= 1229689|doi=10.2307/1229689 |publisher=Stanford Law Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a shareholder rights plan is to force a bidder to negotiate with the target's board and not directly with the shareholders. The effects are twofold:&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Corporate Finance (6th ed.), Editions McGraw-Hill Ryerson, §23: Mergers and Acquisitions&lt;/ref&gt;

* It gives management time to find competing offers that maximize selling price.
* Several studies indicate that companies with poison pills (shareholder rights plans) have received higher takeover premiums than companies without poison pills. This results in increased shareholder value. The theory is that an increase in the negotiating power of the target is reflected in higher acquisition premiums.

===Common types of poison pills===
==== Preferred stock plan ====
The target issues a large number of new shares, often [[preferred stock|preferred shares]], to existing shareholders. These new shares usually have severe redemption provisions, such as allowing them to be converted into a large number of common shares if a takeover occurs. This immediately dilutes the percentage of the target owned by the acquirer, and makes it more expensive to acquire 50% of the target's stock.

==== Flip-in ====
A “flip-in” permits shareholders, except for the acquirer, to purchase additional shares at a discount. This provides investors with instantaneous profits. Using this type of poison pill also dilutes shares held by the acquiring company, making the takeover attempt more expensive and more difficult.

==== Flip-over ====
A “flip-over” enables stockholders to purchase the acquirer’s shares after the merger at a discounted rate. For example, a shareholder may gain the right to buy the stock of its acquirer, in subsequent mergers, at a two-for-one rate.

==== Back-end rights plan ====
Under this scenario, the target company re-phases all its employees' stock-option grants to ensure they immediately become vested if the company is taken over. Many employees can then exercise their options and then dump the stocks. With the release of the "golden handcuffs", many discontented employees may quit immediately after having cashed in their stock options. This poison pill is designed to create an exodus of talented employees, reducing a corporate value as a target. In many high-tech businesses, attrition of talented human resources may result in a diluted or empty shell being left behind for the new owner.

For instance, [[PeopleSoft]] guaranteed its customers in June 2003 that if it were acquired within two years, presumably by its rival Oracle, and product support were reduced within four years, its customers would receive a refund of between two and five times the fees they had paid for their PeopleSoft software licenses. While the acquisition ultimately prevailed, the hypothetical cost to Oracle was valued at as much as US$1.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;The Register, "Oracle chokes on PeopleSoft's poison pill", https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/11/11/oracle_chokes_on_peoplesofts_poison/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Voting plan ====
In a [[voting plan]], a company will charter preferred stock with superior voting rights over that of common shareholders. If an unfriendly bidder acquired a substantial quantity of the target firm's voting common stock, it then still would not be able to exercise control over its purchase. For example, [[ASARCO]] established a voting plan in which 99% of the company's common stock would only harness 16.5% of the total voting power.&lt;ref&gt;Paul H. Malatesta (University of Washington) and Ralph A. Walking (Ohio State University), "Poison Pill Securities: Stockholder Wealth, Profitability, and Ownership Structure," Journal of Financial Economics, Vol. 20, January/March 1988, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these pills, a "dead-hand" provision allows only the directors who introduce the poison pill to remove it (for a set period after they have been replaced), thus potentially delaying a new board’s decision to sell a company.

===Constraints and legal status===
The legality of poison pills had been unclear when they were first put to use in the early 1980s. However, the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] upheld poison pills as a valid instrument of takeover defense in its 1985 decision in [[Moran v. Household International, Inc.]]  However, many jurisdictions other than the U.S. have held the poison pill strategy as illegal, or place restraints on their use.

In Canada, almost all shareholders rights plans are "chewable," meaning they contain a permitted bid concept such that a bidder who is willing to conform to the requirements of a permitted bid can acquire the company by take-over bid without triggering a flip-in event.  Shareholder rights plans in Canada are also weakened by the ability of a hostile acquirer to petition the provincial securities regulators to have the company's pill overturned.  Generally, the courts will overturn the pill to allow shareholders to decide whether they want to tender to a bid for the company.  However, the company may be allowed to maintain it for long enough to run an auction to see if a [[white knight (business)|white knight]] can be found. A notable Canadian case before the securities regulators in 2006 involved the poison pill of [[Falconbridge Ltd.]] which at the time was the subject of a friendly bid from [[Vale Inco|Inco]] and a hostile bid from [[Xstrata]] plc, which was a 20% shareholder of Falconbridge.  Xstrata applied to have Falconbridge's pill invalidated, citing among other things that the Falconbridge had had its pill in place without shareholder approval for more than nine months and that the pill stood in the way of Falconbridge shareholders accepting Xstrata's all-cash offer for Falconbridge shares. Despite similar facts with previous cases in which securities regulators had promptly taken down pills, the [[Ontario Securities Commission]] ruled that Falconbridge's pill could remain in place for a further limited period as it had the effect of sustaining the auction for Falconbridge by preventing Xstrata increasing its ownership and potentially obtaining a blocking position that would prevent other bidders from obtaining 100% of the shares.

In the United Kingdom, poison pills are not allowed under the [[Takeover Panel]] rules. The rights of public shareholders are protected by the Panel on a case-by-case, principles-based regulatory regime. One disadvantage of the Panel's prohibition of poison pills is that it allows bidding wars to be won by hostile bidders who buy shares of their target in the marketplace during "raids". Raids have helped bidders win targets such as [[BAA Limited|BAA]] plc and [[AWG plc]] when other bidders were considering emerging at higher prices. If these companies had poison pills, they could have prevented the raids by threatening to dilute the positions of their hostile suitors if they exceeded the statutory levels (often 10% of the outstanding shares) in the rights plan. The [[London Stock Exchange]] itself is another example of a company that has seen significant stakebuilding by a hostile suitor, in this case the [[NASDAQ]]. The LSE's ultimate fate is currently up in the air, but NASDAQ's stake is sufficiently large that it is essentially impossible for a third party bidder to make a successful offer to acquire the LSE.

Takeover law is still evolving in continental Europe, as individual countries slowly fall in line with requirements mandated by the [[European Commission]]. Stakebuilding is commonplace in many continental takeover battles such as [[Scania AB]]. Formal poison pills are quite rare in continental Europe, but national governments hold [[golden shares]] in many "strategic" companies such as telecom monopolies and energy companies. Governments have also served as "poison pills" by threatening potential suitors with negative regulatory developments if they pursue the takeover. Examples of this include Spain's adoption of new rules for the ownership of energy companies after [[E.ON]] of Germany made a hostile bid for [[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]] and France's threats to punish any potential acquiror of [[Groupe Danone]].

===Other takeover defenses===
Poison pill is sometimes used more broadly to describe other types of takeover defenses that involve the target taking some action.  Although the broad category of takeover defenses (more commonly known as "shark repellents") includes the traditional shareholder rights plan poison pill.  Other anti-takeover protections include:

*Limitations on the ability to call special meetings or take action by written consent.
*Supermajority vote requirements to approve mergers.
*Supermajority vote requirements to remove directors.
*The target adds to its charter a provision which gives the current shareholders the right to sell their shares to the acquirer at an increased price (usually 100% above recent average share price), if the acquirer's share of the company reaches a critical limit (usually one third). This kind of poison pill cannot stop a determined acquirer, but ensures a high price for the company.
* The target takes on large [[debt]]s in an effort to make the debt load too high to be attractive—the acquirer would eventually have to pay the debts.
* The company buys a number of smaller companies using a [[stock swap]], diluting the value of the target's stock.
* The target grants its employees [[stock options]] that immediately vest if the company is taken over.  This is intended to give employees an incentive to continue working for the target company at least until a merger is completed instead of looking for a new job as soon as takeover discussions begin.  However, with the release of the "[[golden handcuffs]]", many discontented employees may quit immediately after they've cashed in their stock options. This poison pill may create an exodus of talented employees.  In many high-tech businesses, attrition of talented [[human resources]] often means an [[Shell (corporation)|empty shell]] is left behind for the new owner.
* [[PeopleSoft]] guaranteed its customers in June 2003 that if it were acquired within two years, presumably by its rival [[Oracle Corporation]], and product support were reduced within four years, its customers would receive a refund of between two and five times the fees they had paid for their PeopleSoft software licenses.  The hypothetical cost to Oracle was valued at as much as US$1.5 billion. PeopleSoft allowed the guarantee to expire in April 2004. If PeopleSoft had not prepared itself by adopting effective takeover defenses, it is unclear if Oracle would have significantly raised its original bid of $16 per share. The increased bid provided an additional $4.1 billion for PeopleSoft's shareholders.
* Classified boards with staggered elections for the [[board of directors]]. For example, if a company had nine directors, then three directors would be up for re-election each year, with a three-year term. This would present a potential acquirer with the position of having a hostile board for at least a year after the first election. In some companies, certain percentages of the board (33%) may be enough to block key decisions (such as a full merger agreement or major asset sale), so an acquirer may not be able to close an acquisition for years after having purchased a majority of the target's stock. As of December 31, 2008, 47.05% of the companies in the S&amp;P Super 1500 had a classified board.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.SharkRepellent.net&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shareholder input===
An increasing number of companies are giving shareholders a say on poison pills. As of June 15, 2009, 21 companies that had adopted or extended a poison pill had publicly disclosed they plan to put the poison pill to a shareholder vote within a year. That was up from 2008's full year total of 18, and was the largest number ever reported since the early 1980s, when the pill was invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laide|first=John|title=Shareholder Input on Poison Pills|url=https://www.sharkrepellent.net/request?an=dt.getPage&amp;st=1&amp;pg=/pub/rs_20090615.html&amp;Shareholder_Input_on_Poison_Pills&amp;rnd=674362|publisher=SharkRepellent.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soil production function''' refers to the rate of [[bedrock]] [[weathering]] into [[soil]] as a function of soil thickness. 

A general model suggested that the rate of physical [[weathering]] of bedrock (de/dt) can be represented as an exponential decline with soil thickness:

&lt;math&gt; de/dt = P_0 \exp{[-k h]}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is soil thickness [m], ''P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' [mm/year] is the potential (or maximum) weathering rate of bedrock and ''k'' [m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;] is an empirical constant.&lt;ref&gt;Heimsath, A.M., Dietrich, W.E., Nishiizumi, K., Finkel, R.C., 1997. The soil production function and landscape equilibrium. Nature 388 (6640), 358–361&lt;/ref&gt; 

The reduction of weathering rate with thickening of soil is related to the exponential decrease of [[temperature]] amplitude with increasing depth below the soil surface, and also the exponential decrease in average water penetration (for freely-drained soils). Parameters ''P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''k'' are related to the [[climate]] and type of parent materials. {{Harvtxt|Heimsath|Dietrich|Nishiizumi|Finkel|1997}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heimsath |first=A. M. |last2=Dietrich |first2=W. E. |last3=Nishiizumi |first3=K. |last4=Finkel |first4=R. C. |author-link2=William E. Dietrich|year=1997 |title=The soil production function and landscape equilibrium |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=388 |issue=6640 |pages=358–361 |doi=10.1038/41056 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;found the value of ''P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' ranges from 0.08 to 2.0 mm/yr for sites in [[Northern California]], and 0.05–0.14 mm/yr for sites in Southeastern [[Australia]]. Meanwhile values of ''k'' do not vary significantly, ranging from 2 to 4 m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

A number of [[landscape evolution model]]s have adopted the so-called ''humped'' model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://serc.carleton.edu/42696 The humped soil production function] Arjun Heimsath. Arizona State University, Earth and Space Exploration  &lt;/ref&gt; This model dates back to [[Grove Karl Gilbert|G.K. Gilbert's]] ''Report on the Geology of the Henry Mountains'' (1877). Gilbert reasoned that the [[weathering]] of bedrock was fastest under an intermediate thickness of soil and slower under exposed bedrock or under thick mantled soil. This is because chemical [[weathering]] requires the presence of water. Under thin soil or exposed bedrock water tends to run off, reducing the chance of the decomposition of bedrock.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4750">The '''Soviet Jewry movement''' was an international human rights campaign that advocated for the right of Jews in the Soviet Union to emigrate.

The earliest organized effort was the Cleveland Council on Soviet Anti-Semitism, a grassroots organization that brought attention to the plight of Soviet Jews from 1963 until 1983.  It began as a study group led by three of the founding members of Beth Israel - The West Temple in 1963: Louis Rosenblum, Herbert Caron, and Abe Silverstein.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thewesttemple.com/about-us/our-history3 Our History]," section "The Cleveland Council on Soviet Anti-Semitism." Beth Israel – The West Temple, Cleveland, Ohio. Retrieved 2015-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the council included prominent rabbis, pastors, priests, and city officials, many initial council members were fellow congregants.  As the first such group in the world, this organization spawned other local councils and a national organization. Between 1964-69, the Cleveland council developed educational tools, such as organizational handbooks for other communities, the newsletter Spotlight, and media presentations. They also devised protest strategies that became integral to the movement to free Soviet Jewry.  One of the council's most successful activities was the People-to-People program of the late 1960s, which represented 50,000 members.

Although not officially sponsored by Beth Israel – The West Temple, the temple provided office space to the council from 1964–78, and the council periodically reported to the congregation's Social Action Committee. Although the Cleveland council was still active in 1985, by the late 1970s the Jewish Community Federation had taken over the major local organizing effort for Soviet Jewry. By 1993, the Cleveland Council on Soviet Anti-Semitism no longer needed to exist, as it had accomplished its mission, and the Soviet Union had also ceased to exist.

Later, [[Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry]], founded by [[Yaakov (Jacob) Birnbaum|Jacob Birnbaum]] at [[Yeshiva University]] in 1964. In 1969, the [[Jewish Defense League]] began a series of protests and vigils while employing militant activism in order to publicize the persecution of [[Soviet Jewry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = "Silent No More" Saving the Jews of Russia, The American Jewish Effort, 1967-1989|last = Feingold|first = Henry L.|publisher = Syracuse University Press|year = 2007|isbn = 0-8156-3101-4|location = Syracuse, New York|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Union of Councils for Soviet Jews]] was formed in 1970 as an umbrella organization of all groups working to win the right to emigrate for oppressed Jewish citizens of the Soviet Union.

The movement was represented in Israel by [[Nativ]], a clandestine agency that sought to publicize the cause of Soviet Jewry and encourage their emigration to Israel.

==Tensions between wings of movement==
Throughout the timeline of the movement to free Jews from the USSR -- 1964 - 1991 -- tensions existed between the Jewish Establishment groups, represented by the umbrella organization the American Jewish Conference on Soviet Jewry and its successor the National Conference on Soviet Jewry. Differences revolved around policy and action.  Behind the scenes, the clandestine Israeli Soviet Jewry office, Nativ (known as the Lishka), supported the ACSJ and NCSJ, which it had helped create.  Such conflicts between Establishment and nascent, independent groups -- such as between the NAACP and SNCC in the civil rights movement -- are not new.&lt;ref&gt; Beckerman, Gal.

'''The theory of symbolic self-completion''' is a [[psychological theory]] which holds that individuals seek to acquire and display [[symbols]] that are strongly related to what they perceive as the ideal self.&lt;ref name=Gollwitzer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wicklund|first1=Robert A.|last2=Gollwitzer|first2=Peter M.|title=Symbolic self-completion.|date=1982|publisher=L. Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale, N.J.: L. Erlbaum Associates|isbn=0898592135}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, relatively effeminate boys who want to appear macho may use products associated with manliness—such as a strong cologne or a silver watch—in hopes of symbolically fulfilling their self-definitions, i.e. becoming manly. Such cases of symbolic self-completion are seen in internet communication, marketing and advertising, and consumer behavior.

== Origins ==

The theory of symbolic self-completion has its origins in the [[symbolic interactionist]] school of thought. As expressed by [[George Herbert Mead|George Mead]] in ''Mind, Self and Society'', symbolic interactionism suggests that the self is defined by the way that society responds to the individual.&lt;ref name="Mind, Self and Society"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mead|first1=George|title=Mind, Self and Society|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226516684|url=http://livros01.livrosgratis.com.br/bu000001.pdf|accessdate=6 November 2014|ref=Mind, Self and Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea helped shape the central ideas put forth in the book ''Symbolic Self-Completion'', which states that individuals tend to define themselves using symbols of accomplishment and that they use symbols to communicate their self-definitions to society.&lt;ref name=Gollwitzer /&gt; Depending on the area of self-definition to which these symbols pertain, a different self-definition is thus exhibited.&lt;ref name=Gollwitzer /&gt;

==Key concepts==

===Self-definitional symbols===

''Self-definitional symbols'' are the objects that individuals use to communicate their self-definitions to society. Symbols can be both material and non-material, including anything ranging from utterances, behaviors, and socially recognized markers such as material possessions and social status.&lt;ref name=Braun&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Braun|first1=Ottmar L.|last2=Wicklund|first2=Robert A.|title=Psychological Antecedents of Conspicuous Consumption|journal=Journal of Economic Psychology|date=1989|volume=10|pages=161–187|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/0167487089900184/1-s2.0-0167487089900184-main.pdf?_tid=9e3083e6-6693-11e4-9494-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1415374672_671bec4cc3ce98724c19e02e8233bd89|accessdate=7 November 2014|doi=10.1016/0167-4870(89)90018-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are defined as "any facet of the person that has the potential to signal to others (who understand the symbol as related to the identity) that one possesses the identity in question."&lt;ref name="Braun"/&gt; Because it is through these symbols that individuals build their self-definitions around and communicate them to society, symbols are “the building blocks of self-definition.”&lt;ref name="Gollwitzer"/&gt; Thus, symbols are meaningful to individuals only insofar as they adequately represent individuals’ self-definitions, regarding the status of accomplishment in the areas individuals believe are important to their self-definitions. When individuals lack symbols to express their self-definitions, they seek to “display alternative symbols of attainment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harmon-Jones|first1=Cindy|last2=Schmeichel|first2=Brandon J.|last3=Harmon-Jones|first3=Eddie|title=Symbolic self-completion in academia: Evidence from department web pages and email signature files|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=2009|volume=39|pages=311–316|url=http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_schmeichel_hj_EJSP_symbolic_self_completion.pdf|doi=10.1002/ejsp.541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that when individuals are deficient in any self-definitional area, this deficiency produces a state of tension and a sense of incompleteness in their self-definitions.&lt;ref name=Gollwitzer /&gt; Individuals are motivated to reduce this tension by using alternate symbols of accomplishment in the relevant self-definitional area.&lt;ref name=Gollwitzer /&gt; In the study “Symbolic Self-completion, Attempted Influence, and Self-Deprecation,” Robert Wicklund, [[Peter Gollwitzer]] and [[James Hilton (academic administrator)|James Hilton]] asked participants to 1) write an essay teaching people how to perform an activity important to them and then 2) indicate how many people should be required to revise their essays. Results of this study showed that the fewer the years of education or experience participants seemed to have in their respective activities, the higher the number of people participants thought should be required to revise their essays.&lt;ref name="1981 (2)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gollwitzer|first1=Peter|last2=Wicklund|first2=Robert|title=Symbolic Self-Completion, Attempted Influence, and Self-Depreciation|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|date=1981|volume=2|issue=2|pages=89–114|url=http://www.interruptions.net/literature/Wicklund-BASP81.pdf|accessdate=2 November 2014|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp0202_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher this number was, the more participants put themselves in a position to influence others; researchers interpreted this relationship as a means of symbolic compensation for lacking the relevant self-definitional area.&lt;ref name="1981 (2)" /&gt;

An additional part of this study asked a group of men to make a statement about their ability in the self-definitional area. Results of this part of the study showed that the less education and experience the men had, the less willing they were to provide a negative evaluation of themselves.&lt;ref name="1981 (2)" /&gt; This behavior remained consistent, even when the men were told that the attractive female confederate preferred men who were critical of themselves.&lt;ref name="1981 (2)" /&gt; This finding shows people are willing to self-symbolize even when they know the self-symbolizing behavior will be negatively received by society.&lt;ref name="1981 (2)" /&gt; Such findings indicate that individuals are more concerned with whether their behaviors will be reflective of their self-definitions than with whether the behaviors induce positive or negative judgments from others. Altogether, these findings indicate that “influencing others, as well as positive self-descriptions, can further the individual’s sense of having a complete self-definition.”&lt;ref name="1981 (2)" /&gt;

===Self-definitional threats===
Individuals' self-definitions can change for purposes of self-esteem protection and maintenance. These changes are likely to occur in consideration of the "relative performance and the psychological
similarity (closeness) and dissimilarity (distance) of others."&lt;ref name=Tesser&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tesser|first1=Abraham|last2=Campbell|first2=Jennifer|title=Self-Definition: The Impact of the Relative Performance and Similarity of Others|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=Sep 1980|volume=43|issue=3|pages=341–347|jstor=3033737|doi=10.2307/3033737}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain dimensions of individuals' self-definitions can become "less self-definitional" when others who are psychologically similar to them outperforms them in those areas.&lt;ref name="Tesser"/&gt; As such, self-definitions lend themselves to change—however, individuals may opt to strengthen their self-definitions in the face of self-definitional threats. ''Self-definitional threat'' refers to a situation in which individuals feel their identities are uncertain or threatened or they feel insecure in an identity they are committed to.&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=Dr. Simon|title=Symbolic Self Completion Theory|url=http://www.psych-it.com.au/Psychlopedia/article.asp?id=292|website=Psychlopedia|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, individuals are more likely to value symbols that reinforce those identities.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

The study “Reactions to self-discrepant feedback: Feminist attitude and symbolic self-completion” shows how a threat to one’s identity also motivates individuals to engage in symbolic self-completion as a means of reducing the tension it causes.&lt;ref name="feminist study"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schiffmann|first1=Rudolf|last2=Nelkenbrecher|first2=Doris|title=Reactions to self-discrepant feedback: Feminist attitude and symbolic self-completion|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=24|issue=2|pages=317–327|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2420240209/abstract|accessdate=4 November 2014|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420240209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers Rudolf Schiffmann and Doris Nelkenbrecher asked a group of feminist participants to subscribe to a feminist journal after being given feedback on their feminist attitudes.&lt;ref name="feminist study" /&gt; The women who were described as less feminist were more likely to subscribe to the feminist journal as a means of symbolically “completing” their self-definition.&lt;ref name="feminist study" /&gt;

Related to this study is "Psychological Antecedents of Conspicuous Consumption" by Ottmar L. Braun and Wicklund. This study was conducted in six separate studies, the first of which involved interviews of law students and attorneys. This first part of the study found that law students were more likely than practicing attorneys to think that it is important to have the "outward manifestations of an attorney," supporting the idea that individuals "striving toward a particular identity" and are "more inexperienced in that identity realm" are more prone to claim that they "can be recognized as belonging to that identity."&lt;ref name=Braun /&gt;

==Applications==

===Symbolic self-completion in Internet communication===
More recent studies have shown how symbolic self-completion influences individuals' communication in online media platforms. For example, Cindy and Eddie Harmon-Jones and Brandon Schmeichel have shown how individuals’ need for self-definition affects whether they share symbols of self-definitional attainment online.&lt;ref name="internet study"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harmon-Jones|first1=Cindy|last2=Harmon-Jones|first2=Eddie|last3=Brandon|first3=Schmeichel|title=Symbolic self-completion in academia: Evidence from department web pages and email signature files|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=June 2008|volume=39|pages=311–316|url=http://www.socialemotiveneuroscience.org/pubs/hj_schmeichel_hj_EJSP_symbolic_self_completion.pdf|accessdate=4 November 2014|doi=10.1002/ejsp.541}}&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers examined academic web pages and email signature files to see what types of academic departments and professors were more likely to enlist professional titles.&lt;ref name="internet study" /&gt; The researchers found that the lower an academic department was ranked within National Research Council Rankings, the higher the number of professional titles the professors in that department displayed in their websites.&lt;ref name="internet study" /&gt; Similarly, the lower the annual rate of publications and citations professors seemed to have, the higher the number of professional titles they enlisted in their email signatures. These correlations suggest that the enlistment of professional titles online serve as alternate symbols of accomplishment in their self-definitional areas; the more they felt they were lacking in a certain area, the more likely they were to engage in symbolic self-completion online regarding that particular area.&lt;ref name="internet study" /&gt;

=== Symbolic self-completion in advertising ===
[[File:Old spice deodorant body spray.jpg|thumb|Old spice deodorant body spray]]
The theory of symbolic self-completion has direct application in the [[advertisement]] industry. The [[mass media|media]] leads consumers to equate advertised products targeting their feelings of “incompleteness” with self-definitional symbols to make up for that incompleteness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elliott|first1=Richard|last2=Wattanasuwan|first2=Kritsadarat|title=Consumption and the Symbolic Project of the Self|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=11147|website=acrwebsite.org|publisher=Association for Consumer Research|accessdate=31 October 2014|ref=(10)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the symbols that each consumer ascribes to may be different in every case, these symbols as a whole can nonetheless be used to improve the individual consumers' perception of themselves. The product-symbols give some consumers a sense of completeness, since “self-perceptions are influenced by product use/ownership when the product has a strong user image and the consumer does not have a well formed self-image.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Newell|last2=Claiborne|first2=C.|last3=Sirgy|first3=M.|title=The Effects of Product Symbolism on Consumer Self Concept|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=7315|website=acrwebsite.org|publisher=Association for Consumer Research|accessdate=31 October 2014|ref=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a deodorant advertisement may appeal to a male consumer's self-definitional need for masculinity, by suggesting that he will become more masculine if he uses the deodorant advertised.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; The Old Spice brand famously uses phrases such as "smell like a man, man" when advertising their products. The "Smell Like A Man, Man" campaign led to Old Spice becoming the number one brand of deodorant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Smell Like A Man, Man Campaign|url=https://www.pg.com/en_US/downloads/innovation/factsheet_OldSpice.pdf|website=P&amp;G|publisher=Procter and Gamble|accessdate=21 November 2014|ref=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; By displaying these product-symbols, consumers improve their sense of self and feel more confident about how others might perceive them.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

=== Symbolic self-completion and materialism ===
Braun and Wicklund suggest that there is a "compensatory relation between person's security" and certain kinds of conspicuous consumption, but that these relations cannot exist without individuals' perceived "incompleteness [of]" and "commitment to the identity in question."&lt;ref name=Braun /&gt; Thus, much of what is colloquially referred to as the “mid-life crisis” can be explained by the theory of symbolic self-completion. A classic example of the mid-life crisis is a 40-year-old man buying a red sports car. The man is unsure as to whether he has made the right choices in his life and if he has been leading a successful career. The man then counters his insecurity by purchasing a material object that functions as a status symbol, something that both he and others will recognize as a mark of success.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

The relationship between self-completion theory and materialism is further shown through individuals' tendency to externalize their concerns about their lives by acquiring symbol-objects that reinforce and improve their self-definitions.&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt; In terms of goods/objects as individuals' status symbols, greater emphasis is placed on tangible, material objects, as they can be recognized and understood as status symbols by a wider audience than are intangible and abstract ideas. In the same vein, materialism reinforces symbolic self-completion particularly in a societies that are structure in such a way that the consumption of prestigious objects is seen as the best remedy for insecurity. This reinforcement is due to the fact that in such societies, individuals see material wealth as the best source of comforting reassurance to counter insecurity&lt;ref name="Moss"/&gt;

In [[pure mathematics|pure]] and [[applied mathematics]], [[quantum mechanics]] and [[computer graphics]], a '''tensor operator''' generalizes the notion of [[operator (mathematics)|operator]]s which are [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s and [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]]s. A special class of these are '''spherical tensor operators''' which apply the notion of the [[spherical basis]] and [[spherical harmonic]]s. The spherical basis closely relates to the description of [[angular momentum]] in quantum mechanics and spherical harmonic functions. The [[coordinate-free]] generalization of a tensor operator  is known as a  representation operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeevanjee|first1=Nadir|title=An Introduction to Tensors and Group Theory for Physicists|date=2015|publisher=Birkhauser|isbn=978-0-8176-4714-8|edition=2nd|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319147932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The general notion of scalar, vector, and tensor operators==

In quantum mechanics, physical observables that are scalars, vectors, and tensors, must be represented by scalar, vector, and tensor operators, respectively. Whether something is a scalar, vector, or tensor depends on how it is viewed by two observers whose coordinate frames are related to each other by a rotation. Alternatively, one may ask how, for a single observer, a physical quantity transforms if the
state of the system is rotated. Consider, for example, a system consisting of a molecule of mass &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, traveling with a definite center of mass momentum, &lt;math&gt;p {\mathbf{\hat z}}&lt;/math&gt;, in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction. If we rotate the system by &lt;math&gt;90^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt; about the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis, the momentum will change to &lt;math&gt;p {\mathbf{\hat x}}&lt;/math&gt;, which is in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction. The center-of-mass kinetic energy of the molecule will, however, be unchanged at &lt;math&gt;p^2/2M&lt;/math&gt;. The kinetic energy is a scalar and the momentum is a vector, and these two quantities must be represented by a scalar and a vector operator, respectively. By the latter in particular, we mean an operator whose expected values in the initial and the rotated states are &lt;math&gt;p {\mathbf{\hat z}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p {\mathbf{\hat x}}&lt;/math&gt;. The kinetic energy on the other hand must be represented by a scalar operator, whose expected value must be the same in the initial and the rotated states.

In the same way, tensor quantities must be represented by tensor operators. An example of a tensor
quantity (of rank two) is the electrical quadrupole moment of the above molecule. Likewise, the octupole and hexadecapole moments would be tensors of rank three and four, respectively.

Other examples of scalar operators are the total energy operator (more commonly called the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]), the potential energy, and the dipole-dipole interaction energy of two atoms. Examples of vector operators are the momentum, the position, the orbital angular momentum,
&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf L}&lt;/math&gt;, and the spin angular momentum, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf S}&lt;/math&gt;. (Fine print: Angular momentum is a vector as far as rotations are concerned, but unlike position or momentum it does not change sign under space inversion, and when one wishes to provide this information, it is said to be a pseudovector.)

Scalar, vector and tensor operators can also be formed by products of operators. For example, the scalar product &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf L}\cdot{\mathbf S}&lt;/math&gt; of the two vector operators, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf L}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf S}&lt;/math&gt;, is a scalar operator, which figures prominently in discussions of the [[spin-orbit coupling|spin-orbit interaction]]. Similarly, the quadrupole moment tensor of our example molecule has the nine components

:&lt;math&gt; Q_{ij} = \sum_{\alpha} q_{\alpha}(3 r_{\alpha, i}r_{\alpha, j} - r_{\alpha}^{2} \delta_{ij})&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, the indices &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; can independently take on the values 1, 2, and 3 (or &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;) corresponding to the three Cartesian axes, the
index &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; runs over all particles (electrons and nuclei) in the molecule,
&lt;math&gt;q_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the charge on particle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;r_{\alpha, i}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th component of the position of this particle. Each term in the sum is a tensor operator. In particular, the nine products
&lt;math&gt;r_{\alpha, i}r_{\alpha, j}&lt;/math&gt; together form a second rank tensor, formed by taking the direct product of the vector operator &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf r}_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; with itself.

==Rotations of quantum states==

===Quantum rotation operator===

The [[Rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]] about the [[unit vector]] '''n''' (defining the axis of rotation) through angle ''θ'' is

:&lt;math&gt;U[R(\theta, \hat{\mathbf{n}})] = \exp\left(-\frac{i\theta}{\hbar}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{J}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where '''J''' = (''J&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''J&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''J&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') are the rotation generators (also the angular momentum matrices):

:&lt;math&gt;J_x = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}\,\quad J_y = \frac{\hbar }{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; i &amp; 0 \\
-i &amp; 0 &amp; i \\
0 &amp; -i &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}\,\quad J_z = \hbar\begin{pmatrix}
-1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and let &lt;math&gt;\widehat{R} = \widehat{R}(\theta,\hat{\mathbf{n}})&lt;/math&gt; be a [[rotation matrix]]. According to the [[Rodrigues' rotation formula#Matrix_notation|Rodrigues' rotation formula]], the  rotation operator then amounts to 
:&lt;math&gt;U[R(\theta, \hat{\mathbf{n}})] = 1\!\!1  - \frac{i\sin\theta}{\hbar}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{J} -\frac{1-\cos \theta}{\hbar^2} ( \hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{J} )^2.&lt;/math&gt;

An operator &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under a unitary transformation ''U'' if
:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\Omega} = {U}^\dagger \widehat{\Omega} U ;&lt;/math&gt;
in this case for the rotation &lt;math&gt;\widehat{U}(R)&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\Omega} = {U(R)}^\dagger \widehat{\Omega} U(R) = \exp\left(\frac{i\theta}{\hbar}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{J}\right) \widehat{\Omega} \exp\left(-\frac{i\theta}{\hbar}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{J}\right) .&lt;/math&gt;

===Angular momentum eigenkets===

The orthonormal basis set for total angular momentum is &lt;math&gt; |j,m\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, where ''j'' is the total angular momentum quantum number and ''m'' is the magnetic angular momentum quantum number, which takes values −''j'', −''j'' + 1, ..., ''j'' − 1, ''j''. A general state

:&lt;math&gt; | \psi \rangle = \sum_m |j,m\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

in the space rotates to a new state &lt;math&gt; |j,m\rangle &lt;/math&gt; by:

:&lt;math&gt; |\bar{\psi} \rangle = U(R)|\psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[completeness condition]]:

:&lt;math&gt; I = \sum_{m'} |j , m' \rangle \langle j, m' | &lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt; | \bar{\psi} \rangle = I U(R)|\psi \rangle = \sum_{mm'} | j , m' \rangle \langle j, m' | U(R) |j , m \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the [[Wigner D matrix]] elements:

:&lt;math&gt;{D(R)}^{(j)}_{m'm} = \langle j, m' | U(R) |j,m \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

gives the matrix multiplication:

:&lt;math&gt; | \bar{\psi} \rangle = \sum_{mm'} D^{(j)}_{m'm} | j , m' \rangle \quad \Rightarrow \quad | \bar{\psi} \rangle = D^{(j)} | \psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

For one basis ket:

:&lt;math&gt; | \overline{j , m} \rangle = \sum_{m'} {D(R)}^{(j)}_{m'm} | j , m' \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

For the case of orbital angular momentum, the eigenstates &lt;math&gt;|l,m\rangle&lt;/math&gt; of the orbital [[angular momentum operator]] '''L''' and solutions of [[Laplace's equation]] on a 3d sphere are [[spherical harmonic]]s:

:&lt;math&gt; Y_\ell^m( \theta , \phi ) = \langle \theta,\phi | \ell , m \rangle =  \sqrt{{(2\ell+1)\over 4\pi}{(\ell-m)!\over (\ell+m)!}}  \, P_\ell^m ( \cos{\theta} ) \, e^{i m \phi } &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;{{ell}}&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; is an [[associated Legendre polynomial]], {{ell}} is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and ''m'' is the orbital magnetic [[quantum number]] which takes the values −{{ell}}, −{{ell}} + 1, ... {{ell}} − 1, {{ell}} The formalism of spherical harmonics have wide applications in applied mathematics, and are closely related to the formalism of spherical tensors, as shown below.

Spherical harmonics are functions of the polar and azimuthal angles, ''ϕ'' and ''θ'' respectively, which can be conveniently collected into a unit vector '''n'''(''θ'', ''ϕ'') pointing in the direction of those angles, in the Cartesian basis it is:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}}(\theta,\phi) = \cos\phi \sin\theta \mathbf{e}_x + \sin\phi \sin\theta \mathbf{e}_y + \cos\theta \mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;

So a spherical harmonic can also be written &lt;math&gt;Y_{l}^{m}=\langle \mathbf{n}|lm\rangle &lt;/math&gt;. Spherical harmonic states &lt;math&gt;|m,l\rangle&lt;/math&gt; rotate according to the inverse rotation matrix ''U''(''R''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), while &lt;math&gt;|l,m\rangle&lt;/math&gt; rotates by the initial rotation matrix &lt;math&gt;\widehat{U}(R)&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;| \overline{\ell , m} \rangle = \sum_{m'} D_{m'm}^{(\ell)} [U(R^{-1})] | \ell , m' \rangle\,,\quad | \overline{\hat{\mathbf{n}}} \rangle = U(R) | \hat{\mathbf{n}}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

==Rotation of tensor operators==

We define the Rotation of an operator by requiring that the expectation value of the original operator &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbf{A}}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the initial state be equal to the expectation value of the rotated operator with respect to the rotated state,

:&lt;math&gt; \langle \psi' | \widehat{A'} | \psi' \rangle = \langle \psi | \widehat{A} | \psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

Now as,

:&lt;math&gt; | \psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; →  &lt;math&gt;| \psi' \rangle = U(R) | \psi \rangle \,, \quad \langle \psi | &lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt; \langle \psi' | = \langle \psi | U^\dagger (R) &lt;/math&gt;

we have,

:&lt;math&gt; \langle \psi | U^\dagger (R) \widehat{A}' U(R)| \psi \rangle = \langle \psi | \widehat{A} | \psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

since, &lt;math&gt; | \psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary,

:&lt;math&gt; U^\dagger (R) \widehat{A}' U(R) = \widehat{A} &lt;/math&gt;

===Scalar operators===

A scalar operator is invariant under rotations:&lt;ref name="Abers ch 5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum Mechanics|author=E. Abers|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=2004|chapter=5|isbn=978-0-13-146100-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; U(R)^\dagger \widehat{S} U(R) = \widehat{S}&lt;/math&gt;

and we have a simple result, that the scalar operator commutes with the rotation generators:

:&lt;math&gt; \left[ \widehat{S} , \widehat{\mathbf{J}} \right] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Examples of a scalar operators include
*the [[energy operator]]:
::&lt;math&gt; \widehat{E} \psi = i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \psi &lt;/math&gt;
*[[potential energy]] ''V''
::&lt;math&gt;\widehat{V}(\mathbf{r},t)\psi = V(\mathbf{r},t)\psi &lt;/math&gt;
*[[kinetic energy]] ''T'':
::&lt;math&gt;\widehat{T}(\mathbf{r},t)\psi = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 (\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt;
*as well as the operator coupling term in [[spin-orbit coupling]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbf{L}}\cdot\widehat{\mathbf{S}} = \widehat{L}_x \widehat{S}_x + \widehat{L}_y \widehat{S}_y + \widehat{L}_z \widehat{S}_z \,. &lt;/math&gt;

===Vector operators===

Vector operators (as well as [[pseudovector]] operators) are a set of 3 operators that can be rotated according to:&lt;ref name="Abers ch 5"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {U(R)}^\dagger \widehat{V}_i U(R) = \sum_j R_{ij} \widehat{V}_j &lt;/math&gt;

from this and the infinitesimal rotation operator and its Hermitian conjugate, and ignoring second order term in &lt;math&gt;(\delta\theta)^2&lt;/math&gt;,one can derive the commutation relation with the rotation generator:

:&lt;math&gt; \left[\widehat{V}_a, \widehat{J}_b  \right] \approx i \hbar \varepsilon_{abc} \widehat{V}_c &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]], which all vector operators must satisfy, by construction. As the symbol ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a [[pseudotensor]], pseudovector operators are invariant [[up to]] a sign: +1 for [[proper rotation]]s and −1 for [[improper rotation]]s.

Vector operators include
*the [[position operator]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbf{r}} \psi = \mathbf{r} \psi &lt;/math&gt;
*the [[momentum operator]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbf{p}} \psi = -i\hbar \nabla \psi &lt;/math&gt;
and peusodovector operators include
*the orbital [[angular momentum operator]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbf{L}} \psi = -i\hbar \mathbf{r} \times \nabla \psi &lt;/math&gt;
*as well the [[spin (physics)|spin operator]] '''S''', and hence the total angular momentum
::&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbf{J}} = \widehat{\mathbf{L}}+\widehat{\mathbf{S}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In Dirac notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle\bar{\psi}|\widehat{V}_a|\bar{\psi}\rangle = \langle \psi | {U(R)}^\dagger \widehat{V}_a U(R) | \psi \rangle = \sum_b R_{ab} \langle \psi | \widehat{V}_b | \psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

and since | ''Ψ'' &gt; is any quantum state, the same result follows:

:&lt;math&gt;{U(R)}^\dagger \widehat{V}_a U(R) = \sum_b R_{ab} \widehat{V}_b &lt;/math&gt;

Note that here, the term "vector" is used two different ways: kets such as {{ket|''ψ''}} are elements of abstract Hilbert spaces, while the vector operator is defined as a quantity whose components transform in a certain way under rotations.

===Spherical vector operators===

A vector operator in the [[spherical basis]] is {{nowrap|''V'' {{=}} (''V''&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} where the components are:&lt;ref name="Abers ch 5"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V_{+1}=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(V_x + i V_y)\,\quad V_{-1}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(V_x - i V_y)\,,\quad V_0 = V_z \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the commutators with the rotation generators are:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[J_z, V_q\right] = q V_q &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left[J_\pm, V_0\right] = \sqrt{2} V_\pm &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left[J_\pm, V_\mp\right] = \sqrt{2} V_0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left[J_\pm, V_\pm\right] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''q'' is a placeholder for the spherical basis labels (+1, 0, −1), and:

:&lt;math&gt;J_\pm = J_x \pm i J_y \,,&lt;/math&gt;

(some authors may place a factor of 1/2 on the left hand side of the equation) and raise (''J''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;) or lower (''J''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt;) the total magnetic [[quantum number]] ''m'' by one unit. In the spherical basis the generators are:

:&lt;math&gt;J_{\pm 1} = \mp \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} J_\pm \,,\quad J_0 = J_z&lt;/math&gt;

The rotation transformation in the spherical basis (originally written in the Cartesian basis) is then:

:&lt;math&gt; {U(R)}^\dagger \widehat{V}_q U(R) = \sum_{q'} {D(R)}^{(1)}_{qq'} \widehat{V}_{q'} &lt;/math&gt;

One can generalize the ''vector'' operator concept easily to ''tensorial operators'', shown next.

===Tensor operators and their reducible and irreducible representations===

A tensor operator can be rotated according to:&lt;ref name="Abers ch 5"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; U(R)^\dagger \widehat{T}_{pqr\cdots} U(R) = R_{pi}R_{qj}R_{rk}\cdots \widehat{T}_{ijk\cdots}&lt;/math&gt;

Consider a dyadic tensor with components ''T&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', this rotates infinitesimally according to:

:&lt;math&gt; U(R)^\dagger \widehat{T}_{pq} U(R) = R_{pi} R_{qj} \widehat{T}_{ij} = R_{pi} \widehat{a}_i R_{qj} \widehat{b}_j &lt;/math&gt;

Cartesian dyadic tensors of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{T}} = \mathbf{e}_i \widehat{a}_i \otimes \mathbf{e}_j \widehat{b}_j = \mathbf{e}_i \otimes \mathbf{e}_j \widehat{a}_i \widehat{b}_j &lt;/math&gt;

where '''a''' and '''b''' are two vector operators:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{a}} = \mathbf{e}_i \widehat{a}_i \,,\quad \hat{\mathbf{b}} = \mathbf{e}_j \widehat{b}_j &lt;/math&gt;

are reducible, which means they can be re-expressed in terms of '''a''' and '''b''' as a rank 0 tensor (scalar), plus a rank 1 tensor (an antisymmetric tensor), plus a rank 2 tensor (a symmetric tensor with zero [[trace (mathematics)|trace]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = \mathbf{T}^{(1)} + \mathbf{T}^{(2)} + \mathbf{T}^{(3)} &lt;/math&gt;

where the first term

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{T}^{(1)}_{ij} = \frac{\widehat{a}_k \widehat{b}_k}{3}\delta_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

includes just one component, a scalar equivalently written ('''a'''·'''b''')/3,  the second

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{T}^{(2)}_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}[\widehat{a}_i \widehat{b}_j - \widehat{a}_j \widehat{b}_i] = \widehat{a}_{[i} \widehat{b}_{j]} &lt;/math&gt;

includes three independent components, equivalently the components of ('''a'''×'''b''')/2, and the third

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{T}^{(3)}_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}(\widehat{a}_i \widehat{b}_j + \widehat{a}_j \widehat{b}_i) - \frac{\widehat{a}_k \widehat{b}_k}{3}\delta_{ij} = \widehat{a}_{(i} \widehat{b}_{j)} - T^{(1)}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

includes five independent components. Throughout, ''δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Kronecker delta]], the components of the [[identity matrix]]. The number in the superscripted brackets denotes the tensor rank. These three terms are irreducible, which means they cannot be decomposed further and still be tensors satisfying the defining transformation laws under which they must be invariant. These also correspond to the number of spherical harmonic functions 2{{ell}} + 1 for {{ell}} = 0, 1, 2, the same as the ranks for each tensor. Each of the irreducible representations '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;, '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt; ...  transform like angular momentum eigenstates according to the number of independent components.

Example of a Tensor operator,

* The [[Quadrupole]] moment operator,

:&lt;math&gt; Q_{ij} = \sum_{\alpha}q_{\alpha} (3 r_{\alpha i}r_{\alpha j} - r_{\alpha}^{2} \delta_{ij})&lt;/math&gt;

* Two Tensor operators can be multiplied to give another Tensor operator.

:&lt;math&gt; T_{ij} = V_{i}W_{j} &lt;/math&gt;

in general,

:&lt;math&gt; T_{i_{1}i_{2}\cdots j_{1} j_{2}\cdots}=V_{i_{1}i_{2}\cdots}W_{j_{1}j_{2}\cdots} &lt;/math&gt;

''Note:'' This is just an example, in general, a tensor operator cannot be written as the product of two Tensor operators as given in the above example.

===Spherical tensor operators===

Continuing the previous example of the second order dyadic tensor '''T''' = '''a''' &amp;otimes; '''b''', casting each of '''a''' and '''b''' into the spherical basis and substituting into '''T''' gives the spherical tensor operators of the second order, which are:

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{T}^{(2)}_{\pm 2} = \widehat{a}_{\pm 1} \widehat{b}_{\pm 1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{T}^{(2)}_{\pm 1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \widehat{a}_{\pm 1} \widehat{b}_0 + \widehat{a}_0 \widehat{b}_{\pm 1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{T}^{(2)}_{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\left( \widehat{a}_{+1} \widehat{b}_{-1} + \widehat{a}_{-1} \widehat{b}_{+1} + 2 \widehat{a}_0 \widehat{b}_0 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Using the infinitesimal rotation operator and its Hermitian conjugate, one can derive the commutation relation in the spherical basis:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[J_a, \widehat{T}^{(2)}_{q} \right] = \sum_{q'} {D(J_a)}^{(2)}_{qq'} \widehat{T}_{q'}^{(2)} = \sum_{q'} \langle j {=} 2, m {=} q | J_a | j {=} 2, m {=} q' \rangle \widehat{T}_{q'}^{(2)} &lt;/math&gt;

and the finite rotation transformation in the spherical basis is:

:&lt;math&gt;{U(R)}^\dagger \widehat{T}^{(2)}_q U(R) = \sum_{q'} {D(R)}^{(2)}_{qq'} \widehat{T}_{q'}^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, tensor operators can be constructed from two perspectives.&lt;ref name="Nielsen Robinson"/&gt;

One way is to specify how spherical tensors transform under a physical rotation - a [[group theory|group theoretical]] definition. A rotated angular momentum eigenstate can be decomposed into a linear combination of the initial eigenstates: the coefficients in the linear combination consist of Wigner rotation matrix entries. Spherical tensor operators are sometimes defined as the set of operators that transform just like the eigenkets under a rotation.

A spherical tensor ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt; of rank ''k'' is defined to rotate into ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&amp;prime;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt; according to:

:&lt;math&gt;{U(R)}^\dagger \widehat{T}_{q}^{(k)} U(R) = \sum_{q'} D(R)^{(k)}_{qq'} \widehat{T}_{q'}^{(k)} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''q'' = ''k'', ''k'' − 1, ..., −''k'' + 1, −''k''. For spherical tensors, ''k'' and ''q'' are analogous labels to {{ell}} and ''m'' respectively, for spherical harmonics. Some authors write ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; instead of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;, with or without the [[parentheses]] enclosing the rank number ''k''.

Another related procedure requires that the spherical tensors satisfy certain commutation relations with respect to the rotation generators ''J&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''J&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''J&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' - an algebraic definition.

The commutation relations of the angular momentum components with the tensor operators are:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[ J_\pm , \widehat{T}^{(k)}_{q} \right] = \hbar \sqrt{( k \mp q )(k \pm q + 1)} \widehat{T}^{(k)}_{q \pm 1} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left[ J_z , \widehat{T}^{(k)}_{q} \right] = \hbar q \widehat{T}^{(k)}_{q} &lt;/math&gt;

For any 3d vector, not just a unit vector, and not just the [[position vector]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = a_x \mathbf{e}_x + a_y \mathbf{e}_y + a_z \mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;

a spherical tensor is a spherical harmonic as a function of this vector '''a''', and in Dirac notation:

:&lt;math&gt; T_q^{(k)} = Y_{\ell = k }^{m = q} (\mathbf{a}) = \langle \mathbf{a}|k,q\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

(the super and subscripts switch places for the corresponding labels ''{{ell}}'' ↔ ''k'' and ''m'' ↔ ''q'' which spherical tensors and spherical harmonics use).

Spherical harmonic states and spherical tensors can also be constructed out of the [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients]]. Irreducible spherical tensors can build higher rank spherical tensors; if ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''q''1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''k''1)&lt;/sup&gt; and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''q''2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''k''2)&lt;/sup&gt; are two spherical tensors of ranks ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respectively, then:

:&lt;math&gt;T_{q}^{(k)} = \sum_{q_1 q_2} \langle k_1 , k_2 , q_1 , q_2 | k , q , q_1 , q_2 \rangle A_{q_1}^{(k_1)} B_{q_2}^{(k_2)} &lt;/math&gt;

is a spherical tensor of rank {{math|''k''}}.

The [[Hermitian adjoint]] of a spherical tensor may be defined as

:&lt;math&gt;(T^\dagger)_{q}^{(k)} = (-1)^{k - q} (T^{(k)}_{-q})^\dagger.&lt;/math&gt;

There is some arbitrariness in the choice of the phase factor: any factor containing {{math|(−1)&lt;sup&gt;±''q''&lt;/sup&gt;}} will satisfy the commutation relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McCarthy |last2=Weigold |first1=Ian E. |first2=Erich |date=2005 |title=Electron-Atom Collisions (Volume 5 of Cambridge Monographs on Atomic, Molecular and Chemical Physics) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=68 |isbn=9780521019682}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The above choice of phase has the advantages of being real and that the tensor product two commuting [[Hermitian]] operators is still Hermitian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Edmonds |first=A. R. |date=1957 |title=Angular Momentum in Quantum Mechanics |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=78 |isbn=9780691025896}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some authors define it with a different sign on {{math|''q''}}, without the {{math|''k''}}, or use only the [[floor and ceiling functions|floor]] of {{math|''k''}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Degl'Innocenti |last2=Landolfi |first1=M.

==Angular momentum and spherical harmonics==

===Orbital angular momentum and spherical harmonics===

Orbital angular momentum operators have the ladder operators:

:&lt;math&gt;L_\pm = L_x \pm i L_y &lt;/math&gt;

which raise or lower the orbital magnetic quantum number ''m&lt;sub&gt;{{ell}}&lt;/sub&gt;'' by one unit. This has almost exactly the same form as the spherical basis, aside from constant multiplicative factors.

===Spherical tensor operators and quantum spin===

{{See also|Spin-weighted spherical harmonics|spin spherical harmonics}}

Spherical tensors can also be formed from algebraic combinations of the spin operators ''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'', as matrices, for a spin system with total quantum number ''j'' = {{ell}} + ''s'' (and {{ell}} = 0). Spin operators have the ladder operators:

:&lt;math&gt;S_\pm = S_x \pm i S_y &lt;/math&gt;

which raise or lower the spin magnetic quantum number ''m&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' by one unit.

==Applications==

Spherical bases have broad applications in pure and applied mathematics and physical sciences where spherical geometries occur.

===Dipole radiative transitions in a single-electron atom (alkali)===

The transition amplitude is proportional to matrix elements of the dipole operator between the initial and final states. We use an electrostatic, spinless model for the atom and we consider the transition from the initial energy level E&lt;sub&gt;nℓ&lt;/sub&gt; to final level E&lt;sub&gt;n′ℓ′&lt;/sub&gt;. These levels are degenerate, since the energy does not depend on the magnetic quantum number m or m′. The wave functions have the form,

:&lt;math&gt; \psi_{nlm}(r,\theta,\phi)=R_{nl}(r) Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

The dipole operator is proportional to the position operator of the electron, so we must evaluate matrix elements of the form,

:&lt;math&gt; \langle n'l'm'|\mathbf{r}|nlm \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

where, the initial state is on the right and the final one on the left. The position operator '''r''' has three components, and the initial and final levels consist of 2ℓ + 1 and 2ℓ′ + 1 degenerate states, respectively. Therefore if we wish to evaluate the intensity of a spectral line as it would be observed, we really have to evaluate 3(2ℓ′+ 1)(2ℓ+ 1) matrix elements, for example, 3×3×5 = 45 in a 3d → 2p transition. This is actually an exaggeration, as we shall see, because many of the matrix elements vanish, but there are still many non-vanishing matrix elements to be calculated.

A great simplification can be achieved by expressing the components of r, not with respect to the Cartesian basis, but with respect to the spherical basis. First we define,

:&lt;math&gt;r_{q} = \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{q}\cdot \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Next, by inspecting a table of the Y&lt;sub&gt;ℓm&lt;/sub&gt;′s, we find that for ℓ = 1 we have,

:&lt;math&gt; r Y_{11}(\theta,\phi)= -r \sqrt{\frac{3}{8\pi}}\sin(\theta) e^{i\phi}=\sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}}\left(-\frac{x+iy}{\sqrt{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; r Y_{10}(\theta,\phi)= r \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}}\cos(\theta) =\sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}}z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; r Y_{1-1}(\theta,\phi)= r \sqrt{\frac{3}{8\pi}}\sin(\theta) e^{-i\phi}=\sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}}\left(\frac{x-iy}{\sqrt{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where, we have multiplied each Y&lt;sub&gt;1m&lt;/sub&gt; by the radius r. On the right hand side we see the spherical components r&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; of the position vector '''r'''. The results can be summarized by,

:&lt;math&gt; r Y_{1q}(\theta,\phi) = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4 \pi}} r_{q}&lt;/math&gt;

for q = 1, 0, −1, where q appears explicitly as a magnetic quantum number. This equation reveals a relationship between vector operators and the angular momentum value ℓ = 1, something we will have more to say about presently. Now the matrix elements become a product of a radial integral times an angular integral,
:&lt;math&gt; \langle n'l'm'|\mathbf{r}|nlm \rangle = \left(\int_0^{\infty}r^2 dr R_{n'l'}^* (r)r R_{nl}(r)\right) \left(\sqrt{\frac{4 \pi}{3}}\int d\Omega Y_{l'm'}^* (\theta,\phi)Y_{1q}(\theta,\phi)Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)\right) &lt;/math&gt;

We see that all the dependence on the three magnetic quantum numbers (m′,q,m) is contained in the angular part of the integral. Moreover, the angular integral can be evaluated by the three-Y&lt;sub&gt;ℓm&lt;/sub&gt; formula, whereupon it becomes proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient,

:&lt;math&gt; \langle l'm'|l1mq\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

The radial integral is independent of the three magnetic quantum numbers (m′, q, m), and the trick we have just used does not help us to evaluate it. But it is only one integral, and after it has been done, all the other integrals can be evaluated just by computing or looking up Clebsch-Gordan
coefficients.

The selection rule m′ = q + m in the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient means that many of the integrals vanish, so we have exaggerated the total number of integrals that need to be done. But had we worked with the Cartesian components r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; of '''r''', this selection rule might not have been obvious. In any case, even with the selection rule, there may still be many nonzero integrals to be done (nine, in the case 3d → 2p).
The example we have just given of simplifying the calculation of matrix elements for a dipole transition is really an application of the Wigner-Eckart theorem, which we take up later in these notes.

===Magnetic resonance===

The spherical tensor formalism provides a common platform for treating coherence and relaxation in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]]. In [[nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[Electron paramagnetic resonance|EPR]], spherical tensor operators are employed to express the quantum dynamics of [[spin (physics)|particle spin]], by means of an equation of motion for the [[density matrix]] entries, or to formulate dynamics in terms of an equation of motion in [[Liouville space]]. The Liouville space equation of motion governs the observable averages of spin variables. When relaxation is formulated using a spherical tensor basis in Liouville space, insight is gained because the relaxation matrix exhibits the cross-relaxation of spin observables directly.&lt;ref name="Nielsen Robinson"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Spherical Tensor Formalism Applied to Relaxation in Magnetic Resonance|author1=R.D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10186">'''Trusted timestamping''' is the process of [[computer security|securely]] keeping track of the creation and modification time of a document. Security here means that no one—not even the owner of the document—should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamper's integrity is never compromised.

The administrative aspect involves setting up a publicly available, trusted timestamp management infrastructure to collect, process and renew timestamps.

==History==
The idea of timestamping information is centuries old.  For example, when [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[Hooke's law]] in 1660, he did not want to publish it yet, but wanted to be able to claim priority.  So he published the [[anagram]] ''ceiiinosssttuv'' and later published the translation ''ut tensio sic vis'' (Latin for "as is the extension, so is the force").  Similarly, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] first published his discovery of the phases of Venus in the anagram form.

[[Sir Isaac Newton]], in responding to questions from [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] in a letter in 1677, concealed the details of his [[calculus|"fluxional technique"]] with an anagram:

:''The foundations of these operations is evident enough, in fact; but because I cannot proceed with the explanation of it now, I have preferred to conceal it thus: 6accdae13eff7i3l9n4o4qrr4s8t12ux. On this foundation I have also tried to simplify the theories which concern the squaring of curves, and I have arrived at certain general Theorems.''

==Classification==
There are many timestamping schemes with different security goals:

* [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]]-based - timestamp token is protected using PKI [[digital signature]].
* [[Linked Timestamping|Linking-based schemes]] - timestamp is generated such a way that it is related to other timestamps.
* Distributed schemes - timestamp is generated in cooperation of multiple parties.
* [[Transient-key cryptography|Transient key]] scheme - variant of PKI with short-living signing keys.
* [[Message authentication code|MAC]] - simple secret key based scheme, found in [[ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard]].
* Database - document hashes are stored in trusted archive; there is online lookup service for verification.
* Hybrid schemes - the linked and signed method is prevailing, see [[ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard|X9.95]].

==Trusted (digital) timestamping==
[[Image:Trusted timestamping.svg|thumb|right|350px|Getting a timestamp from a trusted third party]]
According to the &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 3161&lt;/nowiki&gt; standard, a trusted timestamp is a [[timestamp]] issued by a [[Trusted Third Party]] (TTP) acting as a '''Time Stamping Authority''' ('''TSA'''). It is used to prove the existence of certain data before a certain point (e.g. contracts, research data, medical records, ...) without the possibility that the owner can backdate the timestamps.  Multiple TSAs can be used to increase reliability and reduce vulnerability.

The newer [[ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard]] for [[Timestamp|trusted timestamps]] augments the &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 3161&lt;/nowiki&gt; standard with data-level security requirements to ensure [[data integrity]] against a reliable time source that is provable to any third party. This standard has been applied to authenticating digitally signed data for regulatory compliance, financial transactions, and legal evidence.

==Creating a timestamp==
The technique is based on [[digital signatures]] and [[hash functions]]. First a hash is calculated from the data. A hash is a sort of digital fingerprint of the original data: a string of bits that is practically impossible to duplicate with any other set of data. If the original data is changed then this will result in a completely different hash. This hash is sent to the TSA. The TSA concatenates a timestamp to the hash and calculates the hash of this concatenation. This hash is in turn [[digital signature|digitally signed]] with the [[private key]] of the TSA. This signed hash + the timestamp is sent back to the requester of the timestamp who stores these with the original data (see diagram).

Since the original data cannot be calculated from the hash (because the [[hash function]] is a [[one way function]]), the TSA never gets to see the original data, which allows the use of this method for confidential data.

==Checking the timestamp==
[[Image:Checking timestamp.svg|thumb|right|350px|Checking correctness of a timestamp generated by a time stamping authority (TSA)]]
Anyone trusting the timestamper can then verify that the document was ''not'' created ''after'' the date that the timestamper vouches. It can also no longer be repudiated that the requester of the timestamp was in possession of the original data at the time given by the timestamp. To prove this (see diagram) the [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of the original data is calculated, the timestamp given by the TSA is appended to it and the hash of the result of this concatenation is calculated, call this hash A.

Then the [[digital signature]] of the TSA needs to be validated.  This can be done by checking that the signed hash provided by the TSA was indeed signed with their private key by [[digital signature]] verification.  The hash A is compared with the hash B inside the signed TSA message to confirm they are equal, proving that the timestamp and message is unaltered and was issued by the TSA. If not, then either the timestamp was altered or the timestamp was not issued by the TSA.

==Decentralized timestamping on the blockchain==
With the advent of cryptocurrencies like [[bitcoin]], it has become possible to securely timestamp information in a decentralized and tamper-proof manner. Digital data can be hashed and the hash can be incorporated into a transaction stored in the [[blockchain (database)|blockchain]], which serves as a secure proof of the exact time at which that data existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ws-dl.blogspot.de/2017/04/2017-04-20-trusted-timestamping-of.html|title=2017-04-20: Trusted Timestamping of Mementos|last=Jones|first=Shawn M.|date=2017-04-20|website=ws-dl.blogspot.de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gipp, B., Meuschke, N. and Gernandt, A., 2015 [https://www.gipp.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/gipp15a.pdf "Decentralized Trusted Timestamping using the Crypto Currency Bitcoin."] in Proceedings of the iConference 2015. March 2015, Newport Beach, California.&lt;/ref&gt; The proof is due to a tremendous amount of computational effort performed after the hash was submitted to the blockchain. Tampering with the timestamp would also lead to breaking the integrity of the entire digital currency,&lt;ref name="stefan"/&gt; and this would result in the digital currency devaluing to zero.&lt;ref name="stefan"&gt;May, Stefan (2016).

The decentralized timestamping approach using the blockchain has also found applications in other areas, such as in [[Dashcam|dashboard cameras]], to secure the integrity of video files at the time of their recording,&lt;ref&gt;B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8734">A '''value judgment''' (or '''value judgement''') is a [[judgment]] of the [[right (ethics)|rightness]] or [[wrong]]ness of something or someone, or of the [[usefulness]] of something or someone, based on a comparison or other relativity. As a generalization, a value judgment can refer to a judgment based upon a particular set of [[Values#Personal and cultural values|values]] or on a particular [[value system]]. A related meaning of value judgment is an expedient evaluation based upon limited information at hand, an evaluation undertaken because a decision must be made on short notice.

==Explanation==
The term ''value judgment'' can be used objectively to refer to any injunction that implies an obligation to carry out an act, implicitly involving the terms "ought" or "should". It can be used either in a positive sense, signifying that a judgment must be made taking a value system into account, or in a disparaging sense, signifying a judgment made by personal whim rather than [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] thought or evidence.&lt;ref name=Schaffner&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Scriven (KF Schaffner &amp; RS Cohen, eds.) |title=Philosophy of Science Association PSA: Boston studies in the philosophy of science, v. 20 |page=219 ff |publisher=Dordrecht:Reidel |location=Boston |year=1974 |isbn=90-277-0408-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhY1vAIbdakC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=%22value+judgment%22#PPA219,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its positive sense, a recommendation to make a value judgment is an admonition to consider carefully, to avoid whim and impetuousness, and search for consonance with one's deeper convictions, and to search for an objective, [[Authentication|verifiable]], public, and consensual set of evidence for the [[opinion]].

In its disparaging sense the term ''value judgment'' implies a conclusion is insular, one-sided, and not objective — contrasting with judgments based upon deliberation, balance and public evidence.

''Value judgment'' also can refer to a tentative judgment based on a considered appraisal of the information at hand, taken to be incomplete and evolving—for example, a ''value judgment'' on whether to launch a military attack, or as to procedure in a medical emergency.&lt;ref name=Shrader-Frechette&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Kristin Shrader-Frechette]] (Cohen, R.S., Gavroglou, K., Stachel, J.J., &amp; Wartofsky, M.W., eds.) |title=The case of Yucca Mountain: Science, politics and social practice |page=204 ff |publisher=Springer |location= Dordrecht/New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-7923-2989-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZIo86_X2FAcC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=%22value+judgment%22#PPA204,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the quality of judgment suffers because the information available is incomplete as a result of exigency, rather than as a result of cultural or personal limitations.

Most commonly the term ''value judgment'' refers to an individual's [[opinion]]. Of course, the individual's opinion is formed to a degree by their belief system, and the culture to which they belong. So a natural extension of the term ''value judgment'' is to include declarations seen one way from one value system, but may be seen differently from another. Conceptually this extension of definition is related both to the [[anthropological]] axiom "[[cultural relativism]]" (that is, that cultural meaning derives from a context) and to the term "[[moral relativism]]" (that is, that moral and ethical propositions are not universal truths, but stem from cultural context). A  value judgment formed within a specific value system may be parochial, and may be subject to dispute in a wider audience.

===Nonjudgmental===
 {{POV section|date=December 2012}}
 {{See also|Amorality}}
'''Nonjudgmental''' is a descriptor that conveys the opposite meaning to the pejorative{{Clarify|date=January 2013}} sense of value judgment: it expresses avoidance of personal opinion and reflex "knee-jerk" reactions.

'''Nonjudgmental''' implies open-mindedness, rejection of uninformed assumptions, and avoidance of blame. It may also suggest a capacity for compassion and empathy.

===Judgment call===
{{expand_section|date=September 2013}}
'''Judgment call''' is a term describing decision made on a personal basis.

===Value-neutral===
'''Value-neutral''' is a related adjective suggesting independence from a value system. The object itself is considered value-neutral when it is neither good nor bad, neither useful nor useless, neither significant nor trite, until placed in some social context. For example, the classification of an object sometimes depends upon context: Is an object a [[tool]] or a [[weapon]], is a human remain an [[Cultural artifact|artifact]] or an [[ancestor]]?

A famous quote from mathematician [[G.H. Hardy]] indicates how he places the "value-neutral" subject of mathematics into a particular social context:&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;{{cite book |title=Encarta Book of Quotations |author1=Bill Swainson |author2=Anne H. Soukhanov |page=408 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Af84fBmzmVYC&amp;pg=PA408&amp;lpg=PA408&amp;dq=Hardy+%22a+science+is+said+to+be+useful+if+its+development%22 |isbn=0312230001 |publisher=Macmillan |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|A science is said to be useful if its development tends to accentuate the existing inequalities of wealth, or more directly promotes the destruction of human life.|Godfrey Harold Hardy in ''A Mathematician's Apology'' (1941)}}

For a discussion of whether technology is value neutral, see Martin and Schinzinger,&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mike W Martin  |author2=Schinzinger R  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Ethics in engineering |page=279 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |edition=Fourth |location=Boston |year=2005 |isbn=0-07-283115-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=64iYMPnD3X0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=centrifugal+turntable&amp;cad=0#PPA12,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wallace.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Philip Russell Wallace]] |title=Physics |page=Chapter 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=64iYMPnD3X0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=centrifugal+turntable&amp;cad=0#PPA12,M1 |isbn=9971-5-0930-X |publisher=World Scientific |year=1991 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An item may have value and be value-neutral ''regardless'' of social context if its utility or importance is more-or-less self-evident, for example, oxygen supports life in all societies.

==Value judgements and their context==
Some argue that true objectivity is impossible, that even the most rigorous rational analysis is founded on the set of values accepted in the course of analysis.
&lt;ref name=Scriven&gt;
{{cite book |author=Michael Scriven |title=Proceedings of the 1972 Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association |chapter=Exact role of value judgments in science |editor1=Kenneth F. Schaffner |editor2=Robert Sonné Cohen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhY1vAIbdakC&amp;pg=PA237 |pages=237 ''ff'' |isbn=9027704082 |year=1974 |publisher=Springer}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Consequently, all conclusions are necessarily value judgments (and therefore may be parochial). Of course, putting all conclusions in one category does nothing to distinguish between them, and is therefore a useless descriptor. Categorizing a conclusion as a value judgment takes substance when the context framing the judgment is specified.
&lt;ref name=Cushan&gt;
{{cite book |author=Anna-Marie Cushan |title=Investigation into Facts and Values: Groundwork for a theory of moral conflict resolution |url=http://www.ondwelle.com/ValueJudgements.pdf |origyear=1983|year=2014 |publisher=Ondwelle: Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, scientific "truths" are considered objective, but are held tentatively, with the understanding that more careful evidence and/or wider experience might change matters. Further, a scientific view (in the sense of a conclusion based upon a value system) is a ''value judgment'' that is [[socially constructed]] based upon rigorous evaluation and wide consensus. With this example in mind, characterizing a view as a ''value judgment'' is vague without description of the context surrounding it.

However, as noted in the first segment of this article, in common usage the term ''value judgment'' has a much simpler meaning with context simply implied, not specified.

'''System phenomena''' (also known as and further noted as '''system identification''' and '''[[scientific modeling|modeling]]''') is the science of observing the behaviour of a [[system]]. The classification of a [[dynamic system]] describes how systems are grouped with certain characteristics into special classes and identify mathematical techniques that apply to these classes of problems. 

In particular most systems have five characteristics:
:#[[linear]] or [[nonlinear]]
:#[[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] or [[variable coefficient]]
:#[[forced]] or [[unforced]]
:#[[lumped]] or [[distributed parameter]]
:#[[deterministic]] or [[stochastic]]

[[File:Flickr - boellstiftung - Strategiedebatte (5).jpg|thumb|Werner Schulz (2010)]]
'''Werner Gustav Schulz''' (born January 22, 1950 in [[Zwickau]]) is a German politician ([[Alliance '90/The Greens]]). He was from 1990 to 2005 a Member of the German [[Bundestag]] and from 2009–2014 a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP). Schulz is considered the only profiled civil rights activist from [[East Germany]] who prevailed permanently in his party.

==Training and career as a scientist==
Werner Schulz grew up in Zwickau, the son of an independent haulage contractor and former professional officer from a social-democratic dominated family.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhard Jesse, Martin Böttger: ''Friedliche Revolution und deutsche Einheit. Sächsische Bürgerrechtler ziehen Bilanz'', Ch. Links Verlag, Berlin 2006, S. 226, 270.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964 to 1968, he attended the  "[[:de:Käthe-Kollwitz-Gymnasium (Zwickau)|Käthe Kollwitz]]" Advanced High School. His father forbade him to join the Young Pioneers. He received a degree in Food Technology at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] in 1972. From 1974 he worked as a research assistant working at the Humboldt University.
