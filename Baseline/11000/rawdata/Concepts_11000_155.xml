      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1984">The '''Alexander Funeral Home''' is the oldest African American owned business in [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina]].

Alexander Funeral Home was founded by Zechariah Alexander in 1914 when Alexander bought half of Coles and Smith Undertakes. In 1927 Alexander purchased the remaining part of the business and changed the name to the Alexander Funeral Home. The business passed through the family with [[Kelly Alexander Sr]] and Zechariah Alexander Jr both making careers out of the business.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexanderfunerals.com/home/index.cfm/aboutus/history/fh_id/14043|title=Our Story|website=Alexander Funeral Home|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The funeral home became a sort of gathering place for civil rights activists and leaders in the community. [[Frederick D Alexander|Frederick Alexander]] became the first African American on the Charlotte City Council, [[Kelly Alexander Sr]] served as Chairman of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], Louis Alexander worked with the [[United States Postal Service]] and [[Kelly Alexander|Kelly Alexander Jr]] became a North Carolina Senator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Today the business is locally owned with members of the Alexander family overseeing the running of the company.

In [[engineering]] and [[machining]], an '''allowance''' is a planned deviation between an exact dimension and a [[Real versus nominal value|nominal]] or [[theoretical]] dimension, or between an intermediate-stage dimension and an intended final dimension. The unifying abstract concept is that a certain amount of difference ''allows for'' some known factor of compensation or interference. For example, an area of excess metal may be left because it is needed to complete subsequent machining. Common cases are listed below. An ''allowance,'' which is a ''planned'' deviation from an ideal, is contrasted with a ''[[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]],'' which accounts for expected but unplanned deviations.

Allowance is basically the size difference between components that work together. Allowance between parts that are assembled is very important. For example, the axle of a car has to be supported in a bearing otherwise it will fall to the ground. If there was no gap between the axle and the bearing then there would be a lot of friction and it would be difficult to get the car to move. If there was too much of a gap then the axle would be jumping around in the bearing. It is important to get the allowance between the axle and the bearing correct so that the axle rotates smoothly and easily without juddering. 

__TOC__

==Examples of engineering and machining allowances==

* Outer dimensions (such as the length of a bar) may be cut intentionally oversize, or inner dimensions (such as the diameter of a hole) may be cut intentionally undersize, to allow for a predictable dimensional change following future cutting, [[Grinding machine|grinding]], or [[Heat treatment|heat-treating]] operations. For example:
** the outer diameter of a pin may be ground to {{convert|0.0005|in|mm|3}} oversize because it is known that subsequent heat-treatment of the pin is going to cause it to shrink by {{convert|0.0005|in|mm|3}}.
** A hole may be drilled {{convert|0.012|in|mm|2}} undersize to allow for the material that will be removed by subsequent [[Reamer|reaming]].
* Outer dimensions (such as the diameter of a railroad car's axle) may be cut intentionally oversize, or inner dimensions (such as the diameter of the railroad car's wheel hub) may be cut intentionally undersize, to allow for an [[interference fit|interference fit (press fit)]].
* A part may be cast intentionally too big when it is desired to later machine the surface. This ensures that the roughness that the casting process leaves is removed, and a smooth machined surface is produced. This machining allowance may be e.g. 1mm, but this depends on the size of the part and the accuracy of the casting process.
* A chain segment may be oversized so that at the end of its useful service life (around 20 years), the corroded chain is still above the minimum diameter required to meet the minimum break strength.  This is called a corrosion allowance and accounts for the steel molecules lost through oxidation, erosion and wear, and Microbially Influenced Corrosion.

==Confounding of the engineering concepts of ''allowance'' and ''tolerance''==
{{see also|Engineering tolerance}}
Often the terms ''allowance'' and ''[[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]]'' are used inaccurately and are improperly interchanged in engineering contexts. This is logical because both words generally can relate to the abstract concept of permission — that is, of a limit on what is acceptable. However, in engineering, separate meanings are enforced, as explained below.

A tolerance is the limit of acceptable ''unintended'' deviation from a nominal or theoretical dimension. Therefore, a pair of tolerances, upper and lower, defines a range within which an actual dimension may fall while still being acceptable.

In contrast, an allowance is a ''planned'' deviation from the nominal or theoretical dimension.

=== Example ===
An example of the concept of tolerance is a shaft for a machine is intended to be precisely 10&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter: 10&amp;nbsp;mm is the ''nominal'' dimension. The engineer designing the machine knows that in reality, the [[grinding machine|grinding]] operation that produces the final diameter may introduce a certain small-but-unavoidable amount of random error. Therefore, the engineer specifies a tolerance of ±0.01&amp;nbsp;mm ("plus-or-minus" 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm).

As long as the grinding machine operator can produce a shaft with actual diameter somewhere between 9.99&amp;nbsp;mm and 10.01&amp;nbsp;mm, the shaft is acceptable. Understanding how much error is predictable in a process and how much is easily avoidable; how much is unavoidable (or whose avoidance is possible but simply too expensive to justify); and how much is truly acceptable involves considerable judgment, intelligence, and experience.

An example of the concept of allowance can be shown in relation to the hole that this shaft must enter. It is evident that the above shaft cannot be certain to freely enter a hole that is also 10&amp;nbsp;mm with the same tolerance. It might, if the actual shaft diameter is 9.99&amp;nbsp;mm and the actual hole diameter is 10.01&amp;nbsp;mm, but it would not if conversely the actual shaft diameter is 10.01&amp;nbsp;mm and the actual hole diameter is 9.99&amp;nbsp;mm.

To be sure that there will be enough clearance between the shaft and its hole, ''taking account of the tolerance,'' an ''allowance'' is ''intentionally'' introduced in the dimensions specified. The hole diameter might be specified as 10.03&amp;nbsp;mm with a manufacturing tolerance of ±0.01&amp;nbsp;mm ("plus-or-minus" 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm). This means that the smallest acceptable hole diameter will be 10.02&amp;nbsp;mm while the largest acceptable shaft diameter will be 10.04&amp;nbsp;mm, leaving an "allowance" of 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm. The minimum [[Engineering tolerance|clearance]] between the hole and the shaft will then be 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm. This will occur when both the shaft and the hole are at [[maximum material condition]].

The '''Association for Behavior Analysis International''' ('''ABAI''') is a nonprofit organization dedicated to contributing to the well being of society by developing, enhancing, and supporting the growth of the science of [[applied behavior analysis|behavior analysis]] through research, education, and practice. ABAI has over 7,000 members. It is committed to promoting the experimental, theoretical, and applied analysis of behavior.

==History==

The Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) was founded in 1974 as the MidWestern Association for Behavior Analysis (MABA) to serve as an interdisciplinary group of professionals, paraprofessionals, and students.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;(1978) ''The Behavior Analyst, 1''(1)&lt;/ref&gt; MABA was organized to establish a separate identity for the behavior analysis group of the larger psychological community and to provide a forum for the discussion of issues and the dissemination of information pertinent to the interests of its membership.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The first annual conference was a response by a group of behavior analysts who were having problems presenting their work at psychology conferences and other related events.&lt;ref name= "Trends In Presentations"&gt;Kangas, B.D. &amp; Vaidya, M. (2007). Trends in presentations at the annual conference of the association for behavior analysis. Behavioral Analysis, 30, 2, 117-131&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the members included [[Sidney Bijou]], James Dinsmoor, Bill Hopkins, and Roger Ulrich. The first headquarters were located on the campus of Western Michigan University (WMU) in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The association changed its name to the Association for Behavior Analysis in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;(1979) ''The Behavior Analyst, 2''(2)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the headquarters were moved off WMU's campus. In 2008, the association relocated to nearby Portage, Michigan (where it is today), and added "International" to its name.&lt;ref name= "The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science"&gt;Craighead, W.E. &amp; Nemeroff, C.B. (2004). Association for Behavior Analysis. In The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science. (3rd ed., pp. 87-88) Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; Today ABAI has more than 7,000 active members worldwide.&lt;ref name= "ABAI Membership"&gt;http://www.abainternational.org/membership.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; One can obtain an ABAI membership if they want to further education, practice, and research goals in [[behavior analysis]].

==Membership==

ABAI offers different membership levels. A full membership is available for those who have a master's degree in experiential or applied behavior analysis or have contributed to the field of behavior analysis. An affiliate membership is feasible for those with undergraduate degrees, have an interest in behavior analysis, and do not meet the criteria for a full membership. A student membership is offered to anyone who is a full-time undergraduate or graduate student, resident, or intern.&lt;ref name= "ABAI Membership" /&gt;

==Impact==

ABAI is the leading advocate in the United States for advances in behavior analysis and behavioral psychology in applied settings. The association provides support to the Society for the Advancement of Behavior Analysis (SABA), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that grants funding for continuing research. ABAI is a member of the Federation of Behavioral, Psychological, and Cognitive Sciences (FABBS)—a group of scientific organizations that are interested in advancing science in areas of the brain, mind, and behavior.

ABAI organizes an annual convention dedicated to the advancements in the science of behavior analysis. More than 5,100 behavior analysts come to participate in workshops, poster sessions, “round-table” discussions, symposia, and listen to speakers. In 2017, ABAI will be hosting their 43rd Annual Convention in Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref name= "ABAI Annual Convention" &gt;https://www.abainternational.org/events/annual-2017.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Past host cities for the convention have included Chicago, San Antonio, Seattle, and other. Every two years, ABAI hosts an international conference; the last one took place in 2017 in Paris, France.&lt;ref name= "ABAI International Conference" &gt;https://www.abainternational.org/events/international-2017.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The ABAI international conference has also been held in Japan, Spain, China, Australia, as well as many other places. The association also holds an annual autism conference; the 11th Annual Autism Conference will take place in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in January 2017.&lt;ref name= "ABAI Annual Conference" &gt;http://www.abainternational.org/events/autism-2017.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ABAI has hosted many single-track conferences on topics of special interest to behavior analysts, such as theory and philosophy, climate change, behavioral economics, and education.&lt;ref name= "Past ABAI conferences" &gt;https://www.abainternational.org/events/archives.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13912">[[File:Franklin-Benjamin-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[eponym]] of the effect, [[Benjamin Franklin]]]]

The '''Ben Franklin effect''' is a proposed psychological phenomenon: a person who has already performed a favor for another is more likely to do another favor for the other than if they had ''received'' a favor from that person. An explanation for this is [[cognitive dissonance]]. People reason that they help others ''because'' they like them, even if they do not, because their minds struggle to maintain logical consistency between their actions and perceptions.

The Benjamin Franklin effect, in other words, is the result of one's concept of self coming under attack. Every person develops a persona, and that persona persists because inconsistencies in one's personal narrative get rewritten, redacted, and misinterpreted.&lt;ref name="You are not so smart"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/10/05/the-benjamin-franklin-effect/|title=The Benjamin Franklin Effect|last1=McRaney|first1=David|website=You Are Not So Smart|publisher=You Are Not So Smart|accessdate=15 December 2016|date=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Franklin's observation of effect==
[[Benjamin Franklin]], after whom the effect is named, quoted what he described as an "old maxim" in his autobiography: "He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged."&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin]],'' [http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page48.htm page 48] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118172814/http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page48.htm |date=January 18, 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, Franklin explains how he dealt with the animosity of a rival legislator when he served in the [[Pennsylvania legislature]] in the 18th century:

{{quote|Having heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce and curious book, I wrote a note to him, expressing my desire of perusing that book, and requesting he would do me the favour of lending it to me for a few days. He sent it immediately, and I return'd it in about a week with another note, expressing strongly my sense of the favour. When we next met in the House, he spoke to me (which he had never done before), and with great civility; and he ever after manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we became great friends, and our friendship continued to his death.}}

==Research==
The initial study of the effect was done by Jecker and Landy in 1969; in which students were invited to take part in a Q&amp;A competition run by the researcher in which they could win sums of money. After this competition was over, one-third of the students who had "won" were approached by the researcher, who asked them to return the money on the grounds that he had used his own funds to pay the winners and was running short; another third were asked by a secretary to return the money because it was from the psychology department and funds were low; another third were not approached.  All three groups were then asked how much they liked the researcher. The second group liked him the least, the first group the most – suggesting that a refund request by an intermediary had decreased their liking, while a direct request had increased their liking.&lt;ref name="Changing Minds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/ben_franklin_effect.htm|title=Ben Franklin Effect|website=Changing Minds|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Liking a Person as a Function of Doing Him a Favour| first1=Jon| last1=Jecker| first2=David| last2=Landy| date=August 1, 1969| journal=Human Relations| volume=22 | issue=4| pages=371–378|doi=10.1177/001872676902200407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, [[University of North Carolina]] psychologists John Schopler and John Compere carried out the following experiment:

:They had their subjects administer learning tests to accomplices pretending to be other students. The subjects were told the learners would watch as the teachers used sticks to tap out long patterns on a series of wooden cubes. The learners would then be asked to repeat the patterns. Each teacher was to try out two different methods on two different people, one at a time. In one run, the teachers would offer encouragement when the learner got the patterns correct. In the other run of the experiment, the teacher insulted and criticized the learner when they erred. Afterward, the teachers filled out a debriefing questionnaire that included questions about how attractive (as a human being, not romantically) and likable the learners were. Across the board, the subjects who received the insults were rated as less attractive than the ones who got encouragement.

In short, the subjects' own conduct toward the accomplices shaped their perception of them – "You tend to like the people to whom you are kind and dislike the people to whom you are rude."&lt;ref name="You are not so smart"/&gt;

Results were mimicked in a more recent but smaller study by psychologist Yu Niiya with Japanese and American subjects.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Niiya|first1=Yu|title=Does a Favor Request Increase Liking Toward the Requester?|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|date=21 September 2015|volume=156|issue=2|pages=211–221|doi=10.1080/00224545.2015.1095706|pmid=26392141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect as an example of cognitive dissonance==
This [[perception]] of Franklin has been cited as an example within [[cognitive dissonance]] theory, which says that people change their attitudes or behavior to resolve tensions, or "dissonance", between their thoughts, attitudes, and actions. In the case of the Ben Franklin effect, the dissonance is between the subject's negative attitudes to the other person and the knowledge that they did that person a favor.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Henry Mussen, Mark R. Rosenzweig &amp; Arthur L. Blumenthal (1979). ''Psychology: an introduction'', p.403. University of Michigan. {{ISBN|0-669-01672-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tavris28"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tavris|first=Carol|authorlink=Carol Tavris|title=Mistakes were made (but not by me)|year=2008|publisher=Pinter and Martin|isbn=978-1-905177-21-9|pages=28–29|author2=Elliot Aronson|title-link=Mistakes were made (but not by me)}}&lt;/ref&gt; One science blogger accounts for the phenomenon in the following way: "Current self-perception theory tells us that our brains behave like an outside observer, continually watching what we do and then contriving explanations for those actions, which subsequently influence our beliefs about ourselves....Our observing brain doesn't like it when our actions don't match the beliefs we have about ourselves, a situation commonly referred to as cognitive dissonance. So, whenever your behavior is in conflict with your beliefs (for example if you do a favor for someone you may not like very much or vice versa, when you do something bad to someone you are supposed to care about), this conflict immediately sets off alarm bells in your brain. The brain has a clever response – it goes about changing how you feel in order to reduce the conflict and turn off the alarms."&lt;ref name="The Science Dog"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ben Franklin Effect|url=https://thesciencedog.wordpress.com/2014/01/28/the-ben-franklin-effect/|accessdate=15 December 2016|date=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative explanations==
Psychologist Yu Niiya attributes the phenomenon to the requestee reciprocating a perceived attempt by the requester to ignite friendly relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lebowitz|first1=Shana|title=Harness the power of the 'Ben Franklin Effect' to get someone to like you|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ben-franklin-effect-2016-12|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider Inc.|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory would explain the Ben Franklin effect's absence when an intermediary is used.

==Uses==

Some have observed that the Ben Franklin effect can be useful for improving relationships among coworkers.&lt;ref name="Manage Train Learn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Get Others to Like You: The Benjamin Franklin Effect|url=http://www.managetrainlearn.com/page/franklin-effect|website=Manage Train Learn|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sales field, the Ben Franklin effect can be used to build rapport with a client. Instead of offering to help the potential client, a salesperson can instead ask the potential client for assistance: "For example, ask them to share with you what product benefits they find most compelling, where they think the market is headed, or what products may be of interest several years from now. This pure favor, left unrepaid, can build likability that will enhance your ability to earn that client's time and investment in the future."&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dalton|first1=Steve|title=Harness the Ben Franklin Effect, Boost Your Career|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-dalton/harness-the-ben-franklin-effect_b_4605447.html|accessdate=15 December 2016|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Benjamin Franklin effect can also be observed in successful mentor-protege relationships. Such relationships, one source points out, "are defined by their fundamental imbalance of knowledge and influence. Attempting to proactively reciprocate favors with a mentor can backfire, as the role reversal and unsolicited assistance may put your mentor in an unexpected, awkward situation".&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"/&gt;
The Ben Franklin effect was cited in [[Dale Carnegie|Dale Carnegie's]] bestselling book ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]''. Carnegie interprets the request for a favor as "a subtle but effective form of flattery".

:As Carnegie suggests, when we ask a colleague to do us a favour, we are signalling that we consider them to have something we don't, whether more intelligence, more knowledge, more skills, or whatever. This is another way of showing admiration and respect, something the other person may not have noticed from us before. This immediately raises their opinion of us and makes them more willing to help us again both because they enjoy the admiration and have genuinely started to like us.&lt;ref name="Manage Train Learn"/&gt;

Psychologist Yu Niiya suggests that the Ben Franklin effect vindicates the theory of ''amae'' (甘え). It states that dependent, childlike behavior can induce a parent-child bond where one partner sees themselves as the caretaker.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In effect, ''amae'' creates a relationship where one person feels responsible for the other, who is then free to act immaturely and make demands.

One commentator has discussed the Ben Franklin effect in connection with [[dog training]], thinking "more about the human side of the relationship rather than about the dogs themselves." While trainers often distinguish between the impact of positive and negative reinforcement-based training methods on the dogs, it can also be relevant to "consider the effects that these two approaches may have upon the trainer. The Ben Franklin Effect suggests that how we treat our dogs during training influences how we think about them as individuals – specifically, how much we like (or dislike) them.  When we do nice things for our dogs in the form of treats, praise, petting and play to reinforce desired behaviors, such treatment may result in our liking them more. And, if we use harsh words, collar jerks or hitting in an attempt to change our dog's behavior, then...we will start to like our dog less."&lt;ref name="The Science Dog"/&gt;

== Converse ==
The opposite case is also believed to be true, namely that we come to hate a person whom we did wrong to. We de-humanize them to justify the bad things we did to them.&lt;ref name="Changing Minds" /&gt;

It has been suggested that if soldiers who have killed enemy servicemen in combat situations later come to hate them, it is because this psychological maneuver helps to "decrease the dissonance of killing".&lt;ref name="Changing Minds" /&gt; Such a phenomenon might also "explain long-standing grudges like [[Hatfield–McCoy feud|Hatfield vs. McCoy]]" or vendetta situations in various cultures: "Once we start, we may not be able to stop and engage in behavior we would normally never allow."&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2011/11/16/do-me-a-favor-so-youll-like-me-the-reverse-psychology-of-likeability/#e2331857e300|title=Do Me A Favor So You'll Like Me: The Reverse Psychology of Likeability|last1=Becher|first1=Jonathan|date=November 16, 2011|accessdate=15 December 2016|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one commentator has put it, "Jailers come to look down on inmates; camp guards come to dehumanize their captives; soldiers create derogatory terms for their enemies. It's difficult to hurt someone you admire. It's even more difficult to kill a fellow human being. Seeing the casualties you create as something less than you, something deserving of damage, makes it possible to continue seeing yourself as a good and honest person, to continue being sane."&lt;ref name="You are not so smart" /&gt;

Big History arose from a desire to go beyond the specialized and self-contained fields that emerged in the 20th century. It tries to grasp history as a whole, looking for common themes across multiple time scales in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History |first=David |last=Christian |page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Changing Image of the Sciences |first=Ida H. |last=Stamhuis |page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional history typically begins with the invention of writing, and is limited to past events relating directly to the [[human race]]. Big Historians point out that this limits study to the past 5,000 years and neglects the much longer time when humans existed on Earth. Henry Kannberg sees Big History as being a product of the [[Information Age]], a stage in history itself following speech, writing, and printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Kannberg| first1=Henry| title=Optimism| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/197069825/OPTIMISM-optitunity| website=Scribd| accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Big History covers the formation of the universe, stars, and galaxies, and includes the beginning of life as well as the period of several hundred thousand years when humans were hunter-gatherers. It sees the transition to civilization as a gradual one, with many causes and effects, rather than an abrupt transformation from uncivilized static cavemen to dynamic civilized farmers.&lt;ref name=tws2M23/&gt; An account in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' describes what it [[polemic]]ally asserts to be the conventional "history" view:

{{Quote|Early humans were slump-shouldered, slope-browed, hairy brutes. They hunkered over campfires and ate scorched meat. Sometimes they carried [[spear]]s. Once in a while they scratched pictures of [[antelope]]s on the walls of their caves. That's what I learned during elementary school, anyway. History didn't start with the first humans - they were [[cavemen]]! The [[Stone Age]] wasn't history; the Stone Age was a preamble to history, a [[dystopia]]n era of stasis before the happy onset of civilization, and the arrival of nifty developments like chariot wheels, gunpowder, and Google. History started with agriculture, nation-states, and written documents. History began in [[Mesopotamia]]'s [[Fertile Crescent]], somewhere around 4000 BC. It began when we finally overcame our savage legacy, and culture surpassed biology.|Anthony Doerr reviewing ''On Deep History and the Brain'' by Daniel Lord Smail, 2007&lt;ref name=tws2M23&gt;{{cite news

Big History, in contrast to conventional history, has more of an interdisciplinary basis.&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; Advocates sometimes view conventional history as "microhistory" or "shallow history", and note that three-quarters of historians specialize in understanding the last 250 years while ignoring the "long march of human existence."&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; However, one historian disputed that the discipline of history has overlooked the big view, and described the "grand narrative" of Big History as a "cliché that gets thrown around a lot."&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; One account suggested that conventional history had the "sense of grinding the nuts into an ever finer powder."&lt;ref name=tws2M14&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It explores the mix of individual action and social and environmental forces, according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; While conventional history might see an invention such as sharper spear points as being deliberately created by some smart humans, and then copied by other humans, a Big History perspective might see sharper spear points as accidental, and then natural evolutionary processes enabled their users to be better hunters, even if they did not understand why this was the case.&lt;ref name=tws2M22/&gt; It seeks to discover repeating patterns during the 13.8 billion years since the Big Bang.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; For example, one pattern is that "chaos catalyzes creativity", such as the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|asteroid impact]] wiping out the dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt;

===Time scales and questions===
Big History makes comparisons based on different time scales, or what David Christian calls "the play of scales", and notes similarities and differences between the human, geological, and cosmological scales. Christian believes such "radical shifts in perspective" will yield "new insights into familiar historical problems, from the [[nature versus nurture|nature/nurture debate]] to [[environmental history]] to the fundamental nature of change itself."&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; It shows how human existence has been changed by both human-made and natural factors: for example, according to natural processes which happened more than four billion years ago, [[iron]] emerged from the remains of an exploding star and, as a result, humans could use this hard metal to forge weapons for hunting and war.&lt;ref name=tws2M11/&gt; The discipline addresses such questions as "How did we get here?," "How do we decide what to believe?," "How did Earth form?," and "What is life?"&lt;ref name=tws2M31/&gt; It offers a "grand tour of all the major scientific paradigms."&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; According to one view, it helps students to become [[scientific literacy|scientifically literate]] quickly.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;

===Cosmic evolution===
{{Nature timeline}}
[[Cosmic Evolution (book)|Cosmic evolution]], the scientific study of universal change, is closely related to Big History (as are the allied subjects of the [[epic of evolution]] and [[astrobiology]]); some researchers regard cosmic evolution as broader than Big History since the latter mainly (and rightfully) examines the specific historical trek from Big Bang → [[Milky Way]] → Sun → Earth → humanity. Cosmic evolution, while fully addressing all complex systems (and not merely those that led to humans), which is also sometimes called cosmological history or [[universal history]], has been taught and researched for decades, mostly by [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[astrophysics|astrophysicists]]. This Big-Bang-to-humankind scenario well preceded the subject that some historians began calling Big History in the 1990s. Cosmic evolution is an intellectual framework that offers a grand synthesis of the many varied changes in the assembly and composition of radiation, matter, and life throughout the history of the universe. While engaging the time-honored queries of who we are and whence we came, this interdisciplinary subject attempts to unify the sciences within the entirety of [[natural history]]—a single, inclusive scientific narrative of the origin and evolution of all material things over ~14 billion years, from the origin of the universe to the present day on Earth.

The roots of the idea of cosmic evolution extend back millennia. Ancient Greek philosophers of the fifth century BCE, most notably [[Heraclitus]], are celebrated for their reasoned claims that all things change. Early modern speculation about cosmic evolution began more than a century ago, including the broad insights of [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[Lawrence Henderson]]. Only in the mid-20th century was the cosmic-evolutionary scenario articulated as a research paradigm to include empirical studies of galaxies, stars, planets, and life—in short, an expansive agenda that combines physical, biological, and cultural evolution. [[Harlow Shapley]] widely articulated the idea of cosmic evolution (often calling it "[[cosmography]]") in public venues at mid-century,&lt;ref&gt;Palmeri, J., "Bringing Cosmos to Culture: Harlow Shapley and the Uses of Cosmic Evolution," in ''Cosmos &amp; Culture: Cultural Evolution in a Cosmic Context'', Dick, S.J and Lupsella, M.L. (eds.), NASA SP4802, Washington, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-16-083119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NASA]] embraced it in the late 20th century as part of its more limited [[astrobiology]] program. [[Carl Sagan]],&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, C., ''[[Cosmos (Carl Sagan book)|Cosmos]]'', Random House, 1980, {{ISBN|0-394-50294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Chaisson]],&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E., ''Cosmic Dawn: The Origins of Matter and Life'', [[Atlantic Monthly]]/[[Little, Brown]], 1981, {{ISBN|0-316-13590-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hubert Reeves]],&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, H., ''Patience dans l'azur: L'evolution cosmique'', [[Éditions du Seuil]], 1981&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erich Jantsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Jantsch, E., ''The Self-Organizing Universe'', [[Pergamon Press|Pergamon]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Preston Cloud]],&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, P., ''Cosmos, Earth, and Man'', [[Yale Univ. Press]], 1980&lt;/ref&gt; among others, extensively championed cosmic evolution at roughly the same time around 1980. This extremely broad subject now continues to be richly formulated as both a technical research program and a scientific worldview for the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674009875&amp;content=reviews ''Cosmic Evolution: Rise of Complexity in Nature''], [[Harvard Univ. Press]], 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00987-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick, S.J., and Lupsella, M.L., ''Cosmos &amp; Culture: Cultural Evolution in a Cosmic Context'', NASA SP4802, Washington, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-16-083119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick, S. and Strick, J., ''The Living Universe'', [[Rutgers University Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|0-8135-3733-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmic evolution can elicit controversy for several reasons: [[evolution]] of any kind inherently attracts detractors, especially among religious [[fundamentalists]]; cosmic evolution addresses universal and human origins, which often elevate emotions; it challenges age-old ideas about life's sense of place in the cosmos; it embraces change, which many people dislike or distrust; it welcomes a broad interpretation of the concept of evolution, replacing the idea of evolution exclusive to life, which some biologists prefer; it proposes a sweeping, interdisciplinary worldview based on [[rationality]] and [[empiricism]], which, despite its experimental tests, some find intellectually arrogant.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

One popular collection of scholarly materials on cosmic evolution is based on teaching and research that has been underway at [[Harvard University]] since the mid-1970s&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/AnthologyBH_article.pdf "Researching and Teaching Cosmic Evolution,"] in ''From Big Bang to Global Civilization: A Big History Anthology'', Rodriguez, Grinin, Korotayev, (eds.), [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity, energy, thresholds===
Cosmic evolution is a quantitative subject, whereas big history typically is not; this is because cosmic evolution is practiced mostly by natural scientists, while big history by social scholars. These two subjects, closely allied and overlapping, benefit from each other; cosmic evolutionists tend to treat universal history linearly, thus humankind enters their story only at the most very recent times, whereas big historians tend to stress humanity and its many cultural achievements, granting human beings a larger part of their story. One can compare and contrast these different emphases by watching two short movies portraying the Big-Bang-to-humankind narrative, one animating time linearly, and the other  capturing time (actually look-back time) logarithmically; in the former, humans enter this 14-minute movie in the last second, while in the latter we appear much earlier—yet both are correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_intro_movies.html|title=Cosmic Evolution - Intro to Movies|author=|date=|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_intro_movies.html|title=Cosmic Evolution - Intro to Movies|author=|date=|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These different treatments of time over ~14 billion years, each with different emphases on historical content, are further clarified by noting that some cosmic evolutionists divide the whole narrative into three phases and seven epochs:
::'''Phases''': physical evolution → biological evolution → cultural evolution
::'''Epochs''': particulate → galactic → stellar → planetary → chemical → biological → cultural
This contrasts with the approach used by some big historians who divide the narrative into many more thresholds, as noted in the discussion at the end of this section below. Yet another telling of the Big-Bang-to-humankind story is one that emphasizes the earlier universe, particularly the growth of particles, galaxies, and large-scale cosmic structure, such as in [[physical cosmology]].

Notable among quantitative efforts to describe cosmic evolution are [[Eric Chaisson]]'s research efforts to describe the concept of energy flow through open, [[thermodynamic]] systems, including galaxies, stars, planets, life, and society.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674009875&amp;content=reviews ''Cosmic Evolution: Rise of Complexity in Nature''], Harvard Univ. Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00987-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/EnergyRateDensity_I_FINAL_2011.pdf "Energy Rate Density as a Complexity Metric and Evolutionary Driver,"] ''Complexity'', Vol. 16, p.27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J.,[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/EnergyRateDensity_II_galley_2011.pdf "Energy Rate Density. II. Probing Further a New Complexity Metric,"] ''Complexity'', Vol. 17, p.44, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The observed increase of [[energy rate density]] (energy/time/mass) among a whole host of complex systems is one useful way to explain the rise of complexity in an [[expanding universe]] that still obeys the cherished [[second law of thermodynamics]] and thus continues to accumulate net [[entropy]]. As such, ordered material systems—from buzzing bees and redwood trees to shining stars and thinking beings—are viewed as temporary, local islands of order in a vast, global sea of disorder. A recent review article, which is especially directed toward big historians, summarizes much of this empirical effort over the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/big_history_review_Chaisson_TSWJ2014.pdf "The Natural Science Underlying Big History,"] ''The Scientific World Journal'', v. 2014, 41 pgs, 2014; DOI:10.1155/2014/384912.&lt;/ref&gt;

One striking finding of such complexity studies is the apparently ranked order among all known material systems in the universe. Although the ''absolute'' energy in astronomical systems greatly exceeds that of humans, and although the mass densities of stars, planets, bodies, and brains are all comparable, the energy rate ''density'' for humans and modern human society are approximately a million times greater than for stars and galaxies. For example, the Sun emits a vast luminosity, 4x10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; erg/s (equivalent to nearly a billion billion billion watt light bulb), but it also has a huge mass, 2x10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; g; thus each second an amount of energy equaling only 2 ergs passes through each gram of this star. In contrast to any star, more energy flows through each gram of a plant's leaf during photosynthesis, and much more (nearly a million times) rushes through each gram of a human brain while thinking (~20W/1350g).&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/unifying_concept_for_astrobio.pdf "A unifying concept for astrobiology,"] ''International Journal of Astrobiology'', Vol. 2, p.91, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmic evolution is more than a subjective, qualitative assertion of "one damn thing after another". This inclusive scientific worldview constitutes an objective, quantitative approach toward deciphering much of what comprises organized, material Nature. Its uniform, consistent philosophy of approach toward all complex systems demonstrates that the basic differences, both within and among many varied systems, are of degree, not of kind. And, in particular, it suggests that optimal ranges of energy rate density grant opportunities for the evolution of complexity; those systems able to adjust, adapt, or otherwise take advantage of such energy flows survive and prosper, while other systems adversely affected by too much or too little energy are non-randomly eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/ASUessay_revised_for_CUP.pdf "Using Complexity Science to Search for Unity in the Natural Sciences,"] in ''Complexity and the Arrow of Time: What is Complexity?'', Lineweaver, Davies and Ruse (eds.), [[Cambridge Univ. Press]], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fred Spier is foremost among those big historians who have found the concept of energy flows useful, suggesting that Big History is the rise and demise of complexity on all scales, from sub-microscopic particles to vast galaxy clusters, and not least many biological and cultural systems in between.&lt;ref&gt;Spier, F., ''Big History and the Future of Humanity'', [[Wiley-Blackwell]], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian describes each stage in the progression towards greater complexity as a "threshold moment" when things become more complex, but they also become more fragile and mobile.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt; Some of Christian's threshold stages are:

[[File:SN 1997D.jpg|thumb|right|In a [[supernova]], a star which has exhausted most of its energy bursts in an incredible explosion, creating conditions for heavier elements such as [[iron]] and [[gold]] to form.]]
# The universe appears, incredibly hot, busting, expanding, within a second.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Stars are born.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Stars die, creating temperatures hot enough to make complex chemicals, as well as rocks, asteroids, planets, moons, and our solar system.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Earth is created.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Life appears on Earth, with molecules growing from the [[Goldilocks conditions]], with neither too much nor too little energy.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;
# Humans appear, language, collective learning.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

Christian elaborated that more complex systems are more fragile, and that while collective learning is a powerful force to advance humanity in general, it is not clear that humans are in charge of it, and it is possible in his view for humans to destroy the [[biosphere]] with the powerful weapons that have been invented.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

In the 2008 lecture series through ''[[The Great Courses|The Teaching Company's Great Courses]]'' entitled ''Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity'', Christian explains Big History in terms of eight thresholds of increasing complexity:&lt;ref name=ttc&gt;{{cite book

===Goldilocks conditions===
[[File:Solar sys.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Earth]] is ideally located in a [[Goldilocks principle|Goldilocks condition]]—being neither too close nor too distant from the Sun.]]
A theme in Big History is what has been termed Goldilocks conditions or the [[Goldilocks principle]], which describes how "circumstances must be right for any type of complexity to form or continue to exist," as emphasized by Spier in his recent book.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; For humans, bodily temperatures can neither be too hot nor too cold; for life to form on a planet, it can neither have too much nor too little energy from sunlight. Stars require sufficient quantities of [[hydrogen]], sufficiently packed together under tremendous gravity, to cause [[nuclear fusion]].&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;

Christian suggests that the universe creates complexity when these Goldilocks conditions are met, that is, when things are not too hot or cold, not too fast or slow. For example, life began not in solids (molecules are stuck together, preventing the right kinds of associations) or gases (molecules move too fast to enable favorable associations) but in liquids such as water which permitted the right kinds of interactions at the right speeds.&lt;ref name=tws2M28/&gt;

Somewhat in contrast, [[Eric Chaisson|Chaisson]] has maintained for well more than a decade that "organizational complexity is mostly governed by the ''optimum'' use of energy—not too little as to starve a system, yet not too much as to destroy it" (italics in the original published paper&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, E.J., [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/complexity_santafe_j.pdf "Complexity: An Energetics Agenda,"] ''Complexity'', v9, p14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;). Neither maximum energy principles nor minimum entropy states are likely relevant, and appeals to "Goldilocks principles" (or other such fairy tales) are unnecessary to appreciate the emergence of complexity in Nature writ large.

===Other themes===
[[File:FISHtechniqueInt.JPG|thumb|right|Big Historians use information based on scientific techniques such as [[gene mapping]] to learn more about the origins of humanity.]]
Advances in particular sciences such as [[archaeology]], [[gene mapping]], and [[evolutionary ecology]] have enabled historians to gain new insights into the early origins of humans, despite the lack of written sources.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt; One account suggested that proponents of Big History were trying to "upend" the conventional practice in [[historiography]] of relying on written records.&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt;

Big History proponents suggest that humans have been affecting [[climate change]] throughout history, by such methods as [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture, although past modifications have been on a lesser scale than in recent years during the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name=tws2M13/&gt;

A book by Daniel Lord Smail in 2008 suggested that history was a continuing process of humans learning to self-modify our mental states by using stimulants such as [[coffee]] and [[tobacco]], as well as other means such as [[religious rite]]s or [[romance novel]]s.&lt;ref name=tws2M22&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view is that culture and biology are highly intertwined, such that cultural practices may cause human brains to be wired differently from those in different societies.&lt;ref name=tws2M22/&gt;

===Presentation by web-based interactive video===
[[File:ChronoZoom Timeline Project.jpg|thumb|[[ChronoZoom]] is a free open source project that helps readers visualize time at all scales from the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago to the present.]]
Big History is more likely than conventional history to be taught with interactive "video-heavy" websites without textbooks, according to one account.&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; The discipline has benefited from having new ways of presenting themes and concepts in new formats, often supplemented by Internet and computer technology.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; For example, the [[ChronoZoom]] project is a way to explore the 14 billion year history of the universe in an interactive website format.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws2M18&gt;{{cite news

==History of the field==

===Early efforts===
[[File:AvHumboldt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alexander von Humboldt]] in 1843]]
[[File:Carl Sagan Planetary Society.JPG|thumb|right|Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]]]]
While the emerging field of Big History in its present state is generally seen as having emerged in the past two decades beginning around 1990, there have been numerous precedents going back almost 150 years. In the mid-19th century, [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s book ''[[Cosmos (Humboldt)|Cosmos]]'', and [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers']] 1844 book ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]''&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; were seen as early precursors to the field.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In a sense, Darwin's [[theory of evolution]] was, in itself, an attempt to explain a biological phenomenon by examining longer term cause-and-effect processes. In the first half of the 20th century, secular biologist [[Julian Huxley]] originated the term "evolutionary humanism",&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; while around the same time the French Jesuit paleontologist [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] examined links between [[cosmic evolution]] and a tendency towards complexification (including human consciousness), while envisaging compatibility between cosmology, evolution, and theology. In the mid and later 20th century, ''[[The Ascent of Man]]'' by [[Jacob Bronowski]] examined history from a multidisciplinary perspective. Later, [[Eric Chaisson]] explored the subject of [[Cosmic Evolution (book)|cosmic evolution]] quantitatively in terms of [[energy rate density]], and the astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] wrote ''[[Cosmos (Carl Sagan book)|Cosmos]]''.&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; [[Thomas Berry]], a cultural historian, and the academic [[Brian Swimme]] explored meaning behind myths and encouraged academics to explore themes beyond [[organized religion]].&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt;
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|right|The famous ''[[Earthrise]]'' photo may have stimulated, among other things, an interest in interdisciplinary studies.]]
The field continued to evolve from interdisciplinary studies during the mid-20th century, stimulated in part by the [[Cold War]] and the [[Space Race]]. Some early efforts were courses in ''Cosmic Evolution'' at [[Harvard University]] in the [[United States]], and ''Universal History'' in the [[Soviet Union]]. One account suggested that the notable [[Earthrise]] photo, taken during a lunar orbit by the spacecraft [[Apollo 8]], which showed Earth as a small blue and white ball behind a stark and desolate lunar landscape, not only stimulated the [[environmental movement]] but also caused an upsurge of interdisciplinary interest.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; The [[France|French]] historian [[Fernand Braudel]] examined daily life with investigations of "large-scale historical forces like geology and climate".&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; Physiologist [[Jared Diamond]] in his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' examined the interplay between geography and human evolution;&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; for example, he argued that the horizontal shape of the [[Eurasia]]n continent enabled human civilizations to advance more quickly than the vertical north-south shape of the American continent, because it enabled greater competition and information-sharing among peoples of the relatively same climate.

In the 1970s, scholars in the United States including geologist [[Preston Cloud]] of the [[University of Minnesota]], astronomer G. Siegfried Kutter at [[Evergreen State College]] in Washington state, and [[Harvard University]] astrophysicists [[George B. Field]] and [[Eric Chaisson]] started synthesizing knowledge to form a "science-based history of everything", although each of these scholars emphasized somewhat their own particular specializations in their courses and books.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In 1980, the Austrian philosopher [[Erich Jantsch]] wrote ''The Self-Organizing Universe'' which viewed history in terms of what he called "process structures".&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; There was an experimental course taught by John Mears at [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, and more formal courses at the university level began to appear.

In 1991 [[Clive Ponting]] wrote ''A Green History of the World: The Environment and the Collapse of Great Civilizations''. His analysis did not begin with the Big Bang, but his chapter "Foundations of History" explored the influences of large-scale geological and astronomical forces over a broad time period.

Sometimes the terms "Deep History" and "Big History" are interchangeable, but sometimes "Deep History" simply refers to history going back several hundred thousand years or more without the other senses of being a movement within history itself.&lt;ref name=tws2M25&gt;{{cite news

===David Christian===
One exponent is [[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] of [[Macquarie University]] in [[Sydney]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Christian was also affiliated with [[San Diego State University]] in [[California]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/histweb/course_syllabi/100_level_syllabi/history100_christian.pdf San Diego State University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209212647/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/dept/histweb/course_syllabi/100_level_syllabi/history100_christian.pdf |date=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He read widely in diverse fields in science, and believed that much was missing from the general study of history. His first university-level course was offered in 1989.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; He developed a college course beginning with the [[Big Bang]] to the [[present day|present]]&lt;ref name=tws2M16/&gt; in which he collaborated with numerous colleagues from diverse fields in science and the humanities and the social sciences. This course eventually became a [[Teaching Company]] course entitled ''Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity'', with 24 hours of lectures,&lt;ref name=tws2M27/&gt; which appeared in 2008.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;

Since the 1990s, other universities began to offer similar courses. In 1994 at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], college courses were offered.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; In 1996, Fred Spier wrote ''The Structure of Big History''.&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt; Spier looked at structured processes which he termed "regimes":

{{Quote|I defined a regime in its most general sense as 'a more or less regular but ultimately unstable pattern that has a certain temporal permanence', a definition which can be applied to human cultures, human and non-human physiology, non-human nature, as well as to organic and inorganic phenomena at all levels of complexity. By defining 'regime' in this way, human cultural regimes thus became a subcategory of regimes in general, and the approach allowed me to look systematically at interactions among different regimes which together produce big history.|Fred Spier, 2008&lt;ref name=tws2M41/&gt;}}

Christian's course caught the attention of philanthropist [[Bill Gates]], who discussed with him how to turn Big History into a high school-level course. Gates said about David Christian:

{{Quote|He really blew me away. Here's a guy who's read across the sciences, humanities, and social sciences and brought it together in a single framework. It made me wish that I could have taken big history when I was young, because it would have given me a way to think about all of the school work and reading that followed. In particular, it really put the sciences in an interesting historical context and explained how they apply to a lot of contemporary concerns.|Bill Gates, in 2012&lt;ref name=tws2M31&gt;{{cite news

===Educational courses===
By 2002, a dozen college courses on Big History had sprung up around the world.&lt;ref name=tws2M14/&gt; [[Cynthia Stokes Brown]] initiated Big History at the [[Dominican University of California]], and she wrote ''Big History: From the Big Bang to the Present.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominican.edu/dominicannews/dominican-professor-examines-big-history.html |title=Dominican Professor Examines Big History |publisher=Dominican University of California |accessdate=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Dominican University of California launched the world's first Big History program to be required of all first-year students, as part of the school's general education track. This program, directed by Mojgan Behmand, includes a one-semester survey of Big History, and an interdisciplinary second-semester course exploring the Big History metanarrative through the lens of a particular discipline or subject.&lt;ref name=tws2M42/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominican.edu/academics/advising/firstyearprograms/general-education-ge.html |title=General Education (GE) Requirements |publisher=Dominican University of California |date=2011-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A course description reads:

The Dominican faculty's approach is to synthesize the disparate threads of Big History thought, in order to teach the content, develop critical thinking and writing skills, and prepare students to wrestle with the philosophical implications of the Big History metanarrative. In 2015, [[University of California Press]] published ''Teaching Big History'', a comprehensive pedagogical guide for teaching Big History, edited by Richard B. Simon, Mojgan Behmand, and Thomas Burke, and written by the Dominican faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Richard B., Mojgan Behmand, and Thomas Burke.

There are initiatives to make Big History a required standard course for university students throughout the world. An education project founded by [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[Bill Gates]] from his personal funds was launched in Australia and the United States, to offer a free online version of the course to high school students.&lt;ref name=tws2M11/&gt;

Currently, Big History is a consolidated academic field that is giving rise to new views and epistemological approaches, especially in [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean, whose [[decolonial]] vision of history, economics and science has opened new questions. In this sense, the [[transdisciplinary]] and [[biomimetics]] research of Javier Collado&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coevolution in the Big History - a transdisciplinary and biomimetic introduction to the Sustainable Development Goals |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |url=http://www.globaleducationmagazine.com/tesis-doctoral-Javier-Collado-Ruano-Coevoluci%C3%B3n-en-la-Gran-Historia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; represents an ecology of knowledge between scientific knowledge and the ancestral wisdom of [[native peoples]], such as [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador]]. This transdisciplinary vision integrates and unifies diverse [[episteme]]s that are in, between, and beyond the scientific disciplines, that is, it includes ancestral wisdom, [[spirituality]], [[art]], emotions, mystical experiences and other dimensions forgotten in the [[history of science]], specially by the positivist approach. In approaching the Big History from the [[complexity]] sciences, the transdisciplinary methodology seeks to understand the interconnections of the human race with the different levels of reality that co-exist in nature and in the cosmos,&lt;ref name="Bioethics"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Bioethics as a Transdisciplinary Science of Complexity: A Co-evolutionary Introduction since the Big History |journal=Revista Colombiana de Bioética |volume=11 |issue=1 |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |page=56 |url=http://www.redalyc.org/html/1892/189246655004/|year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and this includes mystical and spiritual experiences, very present in the rituals of [[shamanism]] with [[ayahuasca]] and other sacred plants. The common denominator of all indigenous and aboriginal ancestral worldviews is the spiritual and ecological conception that structures their social organizations, which are in harmony and respect with the different forms of life that exist on our planet.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"/&gt; In the same way that [[Fritjof Capra]] carried out an analysis of the parallels between modern physics and Eastern mysticism, the teaching of the Big History in universities of [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and [[Argentina]] is nourished by the [[worldview]] of their [[ancestor]] to analyze the parallels between the scientific discoveries and the original knowledge of the native and indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"/&gt;

'''Biofiltration''' is a [[pollution control]] technique using a [[bioreactor]] containing living material to capture and biologically degrade pollutants.  Common uses include processing [[waste water]], capturing harmful chemicals or silt from [[surface runoff]], and [[Microbiology|microbiotic]] [[oxidation]] of contaminants in air.

==Examples of biofiltration==
Examples of biofiltration include:
* [[Bioswale]]s, [[biostrip]]s, [[biobags]], bioscrubbers, [[Vermifilter]]s and [[trickling filter]]s
* [[Constructed wetland]]s and [[Wetlands|natural wetlands]]
* [[Slow sand filter]]s
* [[Waste stabilization pond|Treatment pond]]s
* [[Green belt]]s
* [[Green wall]]s
* [[Riparian zone]]s, [[riparian forest]]s, [[bosque]]s

==Control of air pollution==
When applied to air filtration and purification, biofilters use microorganisms to remove [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Joseph S. Devinny, Marc A. Deshusses and Todd S. Webster|title=Biofiltration for Air Pollution Control|edition= |publisher=Lewis Publishers|year=1999|isbn=978-1-56670-289-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The air flows through a packed bed and the pollutant transfers into a thin [[biofilm]] on the surface of the packing material. [[Microorganism]]s, including [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] are immobilized in the biofilm and degrade the pollutant. Trickling filters and bioscrubbers rely on a biofilm and the bacterial action in their recirculating waters.

The technology finds greatest application in treating malodorous compounds and water-soluble [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs). Industries employing the technology include food and animal products, off-gas from [[wastewater]] treatment facilities, [[pharmaceutical]]s, wood products manufacturing, [[paint]] and coatings application and manufacturing and resin manufacturing and application, etc. Compounds treated are typically mixed VOCs and various [[sulfur]] compounds, including [[hydrogen sulfide]]. Very large airflows may be treated and although a large area (footprint) has typically been required—a large biofilter (&gt;200,000 [[acfm]]) may occupy as much or more land than a football field—this has been one of the principal drawbacks of the technology. Engineered biofilters, designed and built since the early 1990s, have provided significant footprint reductions over the conventional flat-bed, organic media type.

[[Image:CVRD4chamber.air.jpg|thumb|right| Air cycle system at biosolids composting plant. Large duct in foreground is exhaust air into biofilter shown in previous photo]]

One of the main challenges to optimum biofilter operation is maintaining proper moisture throughout the system. The air is normally humidified before it enters the bed with a watering (spray) system, humidification chamber, bioscrubber, or biotrickling filter. Properly maintained, a natural, organic packing media like peat, vegetable mulch, bark or wood chips may last for several years but engineered, combined natural organic and synthetic component packing materials will generally last much longer, up to 10 years. A number of companies offer these types or proprietary packing materials and multi-year guarantees, not usually provided with a conventional compost or wood chip bed biofilter.

Although widely employed, the scientific community is still unsure of the physical phenomena underpinning biofilter operation, and information about the microorganisms involved continues to be developed. A biofilter/bio-oxidation system is a fairly simple device to construct and operate and offers a cost-effective solution provided the pollutant is biodegradable within a moderate time frame (increasing residence time = increased size and capital costs), at reasonable concentrations (and lb/hr loading rates) and that the airstream is at an organism-viable temperature.  For large volumes of air, a biofilter may be the only cost-effective solution. There is no secondary pollution (unlike the case of [[incineration]] where additional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; are produced from burning fuels) and degradation products form additional biomass, carbon dioxide and water. Media irrigation water, although many systems recycle part of it to reduce operating costs, has a moderately high [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) and may require treatment before disposal. However, this "blowdown water", necessary for proper maintenance of any bio-oxidation system, is generally accepted by municipal [[publicly owned treatment works]] without any pretreatment.

Biofilters are being utilized in [[Columbia Falls, Montana]] at Plum Creek Timber Company's [[fiberboard]] plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Keriann|title='Bug farm' a breath of fresh air|work=Spokesman Review|date=2008-10-26|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2008/oct/26/bug-farm-a-breath-of-fresh-air}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biofilters decrease the pollution emitted by the manufacturing process and the exhaust emitted is 98% clean. The newest, and largest, biofilter addition to Plum Creek cost $9.5 million, yet even though this new technology is expensive, in the long run it will cost less overtime than the alternative exhaust-cleaning incinerators fueled by natural gas (which are not as environmentally friendly).  The biofilters use trillions of microscopic bacteria that cleanse the air being released from the plant.

==Water treatment==

[[Image:Trickle Filter Cross-section.png|thumb|right|Image 1: A schematic cross-section of the contact face of the bed media in a trickling filter.]]

Biofiltration was first introduced in England in 1893 as a trickling filter for wastewater treatment and has since been successfully used for the treatment of different types of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=D.S. Chaudhary, S. Vigneswara, H.-H. Ngo, W.G. Shim and H. Moon|title=Biofilter in water and wastewater treatment|edition= |publisher=The Korean Journal of Chemical Engineering Vol.20 No.6|year=2003|url=http://josiah.berkeley.edu/Papers/biofilterReview2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological treatment has been used in Europe to filter surface water for drinking purposes since the early 1900s and is now receiving more interest worldwide. Biofiltration is also common in [[wastewater treatment]], [[aquaculture]] and [[greywater]] recycling, as a way to minimize water replacement while increasing [[water quality]].

===Biofiltration process===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:biofilter.jpg|thumb|right|Biofilter installation at a commercial composting facility.]] --&gt;
A biofilter is a bed of media on which microorganisms attach and grow to form a biological layer called [[biofilm]]. Biofiltration is thus usually referred to as a fixed–film process. Generally, the biofilm is formed by a community of different microorganisms ([[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[yeast]], etc.), macro-organisms ([[protozoa]], worms, insect’s larvae, etc.) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (Flemming and Wingender, 2010). The aspect of the [[biofilm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=H.C. Flemming  |author2=J. Wingender |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The biofilm matrix|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=623–633 |edition= |year=2010|doi=10.1038/nrmicro2415 |pmid=20676145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is usually slimy and muddy.

Water to be treated can be applied intermittently or continuously over the media, via upflow or downflow. Typically, a biofilter has two or three phases, depending on the feeding strategy (percolating or submerged biofilter):

* a solid phase (media);
* a liquid phase (water);
* a gaseous phase (air).

Organic matter and other water components diffuse into the biofilm where the treatment occurs, mostly by [[biodegradation]]. Biofiltration processes are usually [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|aerobic]], which means that microorganisms require oxygen for their metabolism. Oxygen can be supplied to the biofilm, either concurrently or countercurrently with water flow. Aeration occurs passively by the natural flow of air through the process (three phase biofilter) or by forced air supplied by blowers.

Microorganisms' activity is a key-factor of the process performance. The main influencing factors are the water composition, the biofilter hydraulic loading, the type of media, the feeding strategy (percolation or submerged media), the age of the biofilm, temperature, aeration, etc.

===Types of filtering media===

Most biofilters use media such as sand, crushed rock, river gravel, or some form of plastic or ceramic material shaped as small beads and rings. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cals.arizona.edu/azaqua/ista/ISTA7/RecircWorkshop/Workshop%20PP%20%20&amp;%20Misc%20Papers%20Adobe%202006/7%20Biofiltration/Nitrification-Biofiltration/Biofiltration-Nitrification%20Design%20Overview.pdf|title=Biofiltration-Nitrification Design Overview|last=Ebeling|first=James|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===

Although biological filters have simple superficial structures, their internal hydrodynamics and the microorganisms' biology and ecology are complex and variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.R. Curds  |author2=H.A. Hawkes |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Ecological Aspects of Used-Water Treatment|edition= |publisher=The Processes and their Ecology Vol.3|year=1983|url=https://books.google.com/?id=D0FRAAAAMAAJ|isbn=9780121995027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics confer robustness to the process. In other words, the process has the capacity to maintain its performance or rapidly return to initial levels following a period of no flow, of intense use, toxic shocks, media backwash (high rate biofiltration processes), etc.

The structure of the biofilm protects microorganisms from difficult environmental conditions and retains the biomass inside the process, even when conditions are not optimal for its growth. Biofiltration processes offer the following advantages: (Rittmann et al., 1988):

* Because microorganisms are retained within the biofilm, biofiltration allows the development of microorganisms with relatively low specific growth rates;
* Biofilters are less subject to variable or intermittent loading and to [[Water hammer|hydraulic shock]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=P.W. Westerman |author2=J.R. Bicudo |author3=A.

===Drawbacks===

Because filtration and growth of biomass leads to an accumulation of matter in the filtering media, this type of fixed-film process is subject to [[bioclogging]] and flow channeling. Depending on the type of application and on the media used for microbial growth, bioclogging can be controlled using physical and/or chemical methods. Whenever possible, backwash steps can be implemented using air and/or water to disrupt the biomat and recover flow. Chemicals such as oxidizing ([[peroxide]], [[ozone]]) or biocide agents can also be used.

==Drinking water==
For drinking water, biological water treatment involves the use of naturally occurring microorganisms in the surface water to improve water quality. Under optimum conditions, including relatively low turbidity and high oxygen content, the organisms break down material in the water and thus improve water quality. Slow sand filters or carbon filters are used to provide a support on which these microorganisms grow. These biological treatment systems effectively reduce water-borne diseases, dissolved organic carbon, turbidity and color in surface water, thus improving overall water quality.

==Wastewater==
Biofiltration is used to treat wastewater from a wide range of sources, with varying organic compositions and concentrations. Many examples of biofiltration applications are described in the literature. Bespoke biofilters have been developed and commercialized for the [[agricultural wastewater treatment|treatment of animal wastes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G. Buelna, R. Dubé  |author2=N.

==Use in aquaculture==
The use of biofilters is common in closed [[aquaculture]] systems, such as [[recirculating aquaculture systems]] (RAS).  Many designs are used, with different benefits and drawbacks, however the function is the same: reducing water exchanges by converting [[ammonia]] to [[nitrate]].  Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) originates from the brachial [[excretion]] from the [[gill]]s of [[aquatic animal]]s and from the [[decomposition]] of organic matter.  As ammonia-N is highly toxic, this is converted to a less toxic form of nitrite (by ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'' sp.) and then to an even less toxic form of nitrate (by ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' sp.).  This "nitrification" process requires oxygen (aerobic conditions), without which the biofilter can crash.  Furthermore, as this nitrification cycle produces H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the pH can decrease which necessitates the use of buffers such as [[Lime (material)|lime]].

[[File:Hjalmars avsked av Orvar Odd efter striden på Samsö.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The Norwegian warrior [[Örvar-Oddr]] bids a last farewell to his blood brother, the Swedish warrior [[Hjalmar]], by [[Mårten Eskil Winge]] (1866).]]
'''Blood brother''' can refer to one of two things: a male [[Kinship|related by birth]], or two or more men not related by [[birth]] who have sworn loyalty to each other. This is in modern times usually done in a ceremony, known as a '''blood [[oath]]''', where each person makes a small cut, usually on a finger, hand or the [[forearm]], and then the two cuts are pressed together and bound, the idea being that each person's blood now flows in the other participant's [[veins]]. The act may carry a risk due to [[blood-borne disease]]s. In modern times, some gangs have also been rumored to make blood pacts. The process usually provides a participant with a heightened symbolic sense of attachment with another participant.

==Cultures==

===Scandinavia===

The Norsemen entering into the pact of foster brotherhood ({{lang-is|[[:is:Fóstbræðralag|Fóstbræðralag]]}}) involved a rite whereby they let their blood flow while they ducked underneath an arch formed by a strip of turf propped up by a spear or spears. An example is described in ''[[Gísla saga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Poole |first=Russell |author-link=Russell Poole |title=Claiming Kin Skaldic-Style |work=Verbal Encounters: Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse Studies for Roberta Frank |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F8naeLlWGikC&amp;pg=PA278 |page=278 |isbn=9780802080110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref={{SfnRef|Dasent|1866}}|translator=George Webbe Dasent|translator-link=George Webbe Dasent |others=Mildmay, C.

''[[Örvar-Oddr's saga]]'' contains another notable account of blood brotherhood. [[Örvar-Oddr]], after fighting the renowned Swedish warrior [[Hjalmar]] to a draw, entered into foster-brotherhood with him {{Dubious span|by this turf-raising ritual. Afterwards, the strand of turf was put back during oaths and incantations.|date=May 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} 

In the mythology of northern Europe, [[Gunther]] and [[Högni]] became the blood brothers of [[Sigurd]] when he married their sister [[Gudrun]]; in [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Ring Cycle]]'', the same occurs between [[Gunther]] and Wagner's version of Sigurd, [[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]], which is marked by the "Blood Brotherhood [[Leitmotiv]]". Additionally, it is briefly stated in [[Lokasenna]] that [[Odin]] and [[Loki]] are blood brothers.

===Scythia===
Among the [[Scyth]]ians, the covenantors would allow their blood to drip into a cup; the blood was subsequently mixed with wine and drunk by both participants. Every man was limited to having at most three blood brotherhoods at any time, lest his loyalties be distrusted; as a consequence, blood brotherhood was highly sought after and often preceded by a lengthy period of affiliation and friendship ([[Lucian]], ''[[Toxaris]]''). 
4th-century BC depictions of two Scythian warriors drinking from a single [[drinking horn]] (most notably in a gold appliqué from [[Kul-Oba]]) have been associated with the Scythian oath of blood brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar Meyer, ''Greco-Scythian Art and the Birth of Eurasia: From Classical Antiquity to Russian Modernity'',  OUP (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=884TAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 246 (fig. 98b)] "Gold relief appliqué showing two Scythians drinking from one drinking horn. From [[Kul-Oba]] (Inventory 2, K.12h). Rostoftzeff identified the scene with the Scythain sacred oath described in Herodotus 4.70. Fourth century BC. 5 × 3.7 cm, 28.35 gr."; see also

The Hungarian [[hajduk]]s had a similar ceremony, though the wine was often replaced with milk so that the blood would be more visible.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Asia===
In [[Culture of Asia|Asian cultures]], the act and ceremony of becoming blood brothers is generally seen as a [[tribal]] relationship, that is, to bring about alliance between tribes. It was practiced for this reason most notably among the [[Mongol]]s and [[Chinese history|early Chinese]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'','' the Chinese classical literature, the three main characters took an oath of blood brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Oath of the Peach Garden|date=2018-07-28|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oath_of_the_Peach_Garden&amp;oldid=852357830|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mongolian history, Genghis Khan the Great had an anda, blood brother in Mongolian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/anda|title=Anda {{!}} oath|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
The blood oath was used in much the same fashion as has already been described in much of 
[[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. The British colonial administrator [[Lord Lugard]] is famous for having become blood brothers with numerous African chiefs as part of his political policy while in Africa. A powerful blood brother of his was the 
[[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] chieftain [[Waiyaki Wa Hinga]].

===Americas===
There may be some evidence that [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] performed blood oathes to bring about [[Political alliance|alliances]] between tribes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Southeastern Europe===
Blood brothers among larger groups were common in ancient [[Southeastern Europe]] where, for example, whole companies of soldiers would become one family through the ceremony. It was perhaps most prevalent in the [[Balkans]] during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era, as it helped the oppressed people to fight the enemy more effectively; blood brotherhoods were common in what is today [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Greece]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Christianity also recognized sworn brotherhood in a ceremony (known as {{lang-gr|[[adelphopoiesis]]}}, {{lang-sla|pobratimstvo}} in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches; known as {{lang-la|ordo ad fratres faciendum}} in the [[Roman Catholic]] church). The tradition of intertwining arms and drinking wine is also believed to be a representation of becoming blood brothers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Caucasus===
Blood brotherhood, highly ritualized and subjected to a strong code, was a common practice in the [[Caucasus]], especially among the mountaineers. Some relics of this tradition survive to this day.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

=== Folklore and popular culture ===
* The Norse gods [[Loki]] and [[Odin]] are famously stated to have mixed blood in ''days of old'' in ''Lokasenna''. This has been taken as an explanation why Loki is at all tolerated by the gods. 
* [[Liu Bei]], [[Guan Yu]] and [[Zhang Fei (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Fei]]. In the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' by [[Luo Guanzhong]], these three men swore in their famous [[Oath of the Peach Garden]] that despite not being born on the same day, their sworn brotherhood would end with them dying on the same day. Histories only mention that the three men were "close like brothers".
* In the Chinese tale ''[[Journey to the West]]'', [[Sun Wukong]] (the Monkey King) became blood brothers with [[List of Journey to the West characters#Bull Demon King, Princess Iron Fan and associates|Niu Mowang]] (the Bull Demon King), but later on this brother relationship was forgotten because of a conflict that occurred involving the bull demon's son that caused other problems for Wukong.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30723">'''Education sector responses to LGBT violence''' addresses the ways in which education systems work to create safe learning environments for [[LGBT]] students. Overall, education sector responses tend to focus on [[homophobia]] and [[Violence against LGBT people|violence linked to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression]], and less on [[transphobia]]. Most responses focus in some way on diverse expressions of gender and support students to understand that gender may be expressed in a different way from [[Gender role|binary models]] (of masculine and feminine). Responses vary greatly in their scope (from a single class to the national level); duration (from one-off events to several years); and level of support that they enjoy (from individual teachers to the highest levels of government).&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf|title=Out in the Open: Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100150-5|location=|pages=15, 61–62, 65, 69–75, 82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive [[Education#Education sector|education sector]] response to homophobic and transphobic violence encompasses all of the following elements: effective policies, relevant curricula and learning materials, training and support for staff, support for students and families information and strategic partnerships, and monitoring and evaluation.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Very few countries have education sector policies that address homophobic and transphobic violence or include [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]]/expression in [[Curriculum|curricula]] or learning materials. In most countries, staff lack training and support to address sexual orientation and gender identity/expression and to prevent and respond to homophobic and transphobic violence. Although many countries provide support for students who experience violence, services are often ill-equipped to deal with homophobic and transphobic violence. Few countries collect data on the nature, prevalence or impact of homophobic and transphobic violence, which contributes to low awareness of the problem and lack of evidence for planning effective responses.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In general terms, the range of responses to homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings appears to correlate to a country's: socio-cultural context (in terms of the society's beliefs and attitudes towards sexual and [[gender diversity]], as well as to [[human rights]] and [[gender equality]]); and legal context (in terms of the rights of LGBTI individuals and the situation of human rights in general).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; 

== Policy approaches ==
Few countries have developed education sector policies to prevent and address homophobic and transphobic violence in schools, reflecting the fact that recognition of the prevalence and harmful impact of such violence in the sector is a relatively recent development. Most countries that have developed policies have taken one of the two following approaches:
* Integrating references to sexual orientation and gender identity or to homophobic and transphobic discrimination and violence into existing education sector policies on general violence, [[bullying]] or discrimination.
* Developing specific education sector policies that focus on violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
The first approach aims to protect and support LGBTI students by mainstreaming issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity into broader policies to prevent and address discrimination and violence. However, available data suggest that in countries where policies do not clearly refer to homophobic and transphobic violence, this form of violence may not be addressed by schools. For example, a large-scale qualitative research study conducted in 19 European countries in 2013 by the European Union [[Fundamental Rights Agency]] concluded that: 'Where anti-bullying measures are in place, these are often generic and they may be ineffective in dealing specifically with bullying on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;FRA, Professionally speaking: challenges to achieving equality for LGBT people. Vienna - Austria: European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
The second approach requires political leadership and a legal environment that is conducive to the protection of the rights of LGBTI people. A number of countries have developed specific education sector policies that address homophobic and transphobic violence in schools and other educational settings.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Work conducted in countering violence in schools in general has shown that 'school and system wide interventions', often referred to as 'whole school' strategies or approaches, are particularly effective. The same applies to education sector responses to homophobic and transphobic violence. In this report, 'whole school' responses to homophobic and transphobic violence are also referred to as 'comprehensive' education sector responses, which can also be referred to as 'holistic', 'systematic', 'systemic', 'system-wide'.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== National policies ==
Progress in implementing measures to prevent and address homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings varies between regions and countries. The most comprehensive initiatives are being implemented in Australia and New Zealand, Canada and the United States, and a number of countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. However, the education sector response has been limited in the majority of countries in the world, particularly in Africa, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Central Asia and some areas of the Pacific. In addition, it is important to note that many countries do not have comprehensive strategies to prevent and address violence in schools in general.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

National legislation against discrimination (as a whole) has served as a basis to develop national policies – which either include, or are specific to, the education sector – that address discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. In general, the education sector tends to address homophobic and transphobic violence through wider policies on violence, such as those related to bullying in schools or safe schools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Asia ===
In Asia, the Philippines is the only country to include specific references to violence on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in a national law (2013).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;UNESCO, 'From Insult to Inclusion: Asia-Pacific report on school bullying, violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity', UNESCO, Paris and Bangkok, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, in 2015, the Ministry of Education issued landmark guidance urging local education boards to ensure that schools cater to the needs of LGBT students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At a more local level, the 2004 [[Gender Equity Education Act (Taiwan)|Gender Equity Education Act]] in Taiwan of China seeks to eliminate gender stereotypes from the curriculum and prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, a regional report developed for this review notes that implementation measures for this Act may be inadequate to effectively prevent and address discrimination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

All other countries in the Asia region, apart from Pakistan, have legal or policy frameworks to address violence in educational institutions or the health of minors, although they vary in their nature and jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In India, following a 2014 ruling by the Supreme Court recognizing the status of [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijras]], the University Grants Commission called on all universities to recognize transgender students and to include a transgender category on all application forms, academic testimonials and official documents.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, 'Asia-Pacific Consultation on School Bullying based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity / Expression - Meeting Report', UNESCO, Bangkok, Thailand, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== North America ===
In North America, in 2002, the Supreme Court in Canada ruled that LGBT students and same-sex parents had the right to be safe from discrimination and to see their lives reflected in the school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court Judgements, 'Chamberlain v. Surrey School District No. 36, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 710, 2002 SCC 86', 2012. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/&lt;/nowiki&gt; scc-csc/en/item/2030/index.do. [Accessed: 10-Aug-2015].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Smith, 'Questioning heteronormativity: Lesbian and gay challenges to educational practice in British Columbia, Canada', Soc. Mov. Stud., vol. 3, no. 2, pp. 131–145, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, it ruled that school districts were 'liable for the discriminatory conduct of the students who harassed' and that they had a duty to provide students with 'an educational environment that does not expose them to discriminatory harassment'.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Appeal for British Columbia, 'School District No. 44 (North Vancouver) v. Jubran, 2005 BCCA 201 (CanLII)', 2005. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/&lt;/nowiki&gt; doc/2005/2005bcca201/2005bcca201.html. [Accessed: 10-Aug-2015].&lt;/ref&gt; The Ontario Education Act of Canada was amended in 2012 to specifically integrate attention to homophobic bullying following several years of amendments to Safe School legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Legislative Assembly of Ontario, 'Bill 13, Accepting Schools Act', 2012. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&amp;BillID=2549&lt;/nowiki&gt;. [Accessed: 23-Sep- 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; The Act strengthened legal obligations for school boards to foster positive school environments and to prevent and address inappropriate student behaviour, including homophobic or transphobic violence. For example, principals must suspend students and consider expulsion for misbehaviour that is motivated by bias, prejudice or hatred, including that which is based on gender, sexual orientation or gender identity/expression. School boards must provide support for victims of bullying, witnesses and perpetrators. In Quebec, legislation was adopted in 2012 for schools to provide healthy and safe learning environments, allowing every student to develop their full potential regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity/expression.&lt;ref&gt;Assemblée nationale du Québec, 'Bill 56: An Act to Prevent and Stop Bullying and Violence in Schools', 2015. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux-parlementaires/&lt;/nowiki&gt; projets-loi/projet-loi-56-39-2.html. [Accessed: 20-Aug-2015].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the United States, LGBT students are not protected under federal legislation. However, in 2010, the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] issued guidance to specify that federal provisions outlawing discrimination on the basis of sex in education (Title IX) also offered some protection against bullying on the basis of sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, 'Dear Colleague Letter', 2010. [Online]. Available: http:// www2.ed.gov/about/of ces/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201010.html. [Accessed: 12-Jul- 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it extended this protection on the grounds of gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, 'Questions and Answers on Title IX and Sexual Violence', 2014. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www2.ed.gov/about/of&lt;/nowiki&gt; ces/list/ocr/docs/qa-201404-title- ix.pdf. [Accessed: 12-Oct-2015].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] also clarified that transgender students must be allowed to use restrooms that correspond to their gender identity and that failure to do so amounts to sex discrimination under Title IX.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In May 2016, the Department of Education released Examples of Policies and Emerging Practices for Supporting Transgender Students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oese/oshs/emergingpractices.pdf|title=Examples of Policies and Emerging Practices for Supporting Transgender Students|last=U.S. Department of Education|first=|date=May 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document has a list of questions and answers for schools and educators concerning Student transitions, Privacy, Confidentiality, and Student Records, Sex-Segregated Activities and Facilities, Additional Practices to Support Transgender Students, Terminology, Cited Policies on Transgender Students, and Select Federal Resources on Transgender Students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oese/oshs/emergingpractices.pdf|title=Examples of Policies and Emerging Practices for Supporting Transgender Students|last=U.S. Department of Education|first=|date=May 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 22, 2017, the U.S. Department of Education withdrew statements of support and guidance previously issued in the Letter to Emily Prince from James A. Ferg-Cadima, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy, Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education dated January 7, 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201702-title-ix.docx|title=Dear Colleague Letter to Emily Prince from James A.

=== Latin America ===
In Latin America and the Caribbean, Argentina is the only country that offers a full normative framework to tackle sexual orientation and gender identity/expression issues in educational contexts through the National Law on Integral Sexuality Education (2006) (26.150), the National Law on Education (2006) (26.206), the National Law for the Promotion of Coexistence and Tackling Social Conflict in Educational Institutions (2013) (26.892) and a federal guide for educational responses for addressing challenging situations linked to school life. The guide also contains a specific section on discrimination and harassment due to sexual orientation or gender identity/expression.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In 2015, the [[Constitutional Court of Colombia]] and the [[Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation|Supreme Court of Mexico]] found that bullying undermined victims' dignity, integrity and education&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Santiago, 'La violencia homofóbica y transfóbica en el ámbito escolar: hacia centros educativos inclusivos y seguros en América Latina', UNESCO, Santiago, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the education sector had a direct duty to protect students from violence based on their personal characteristics.

In Uruguay, the General Law on Education (2014) includes a general reference to non-discrimination due to sexual orientation. In El Salvador, the General Law on Youth, while not referring to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression, recognizes and guarantees the right to integral comprehensive sexuality education (2013). Also the General Law on Education's article 5-A condemns inequalities and discriminatory practices between or towards students when based on traditional gendered roles (1990).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other countries have instruments to prevent and counter discrimination or violence, including bullying. Examples include the following:

In Chile, Law 20.609 (2012) and the Law on Education (2009) are in place to counter discrimination in general and can also be applied to a school setting. However, as none of the laws are LGBT-specific, addressing homophobic and transphobic violence is left at the discretion of individual schools.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In Colombia, no specific policy exists to tackle homophobic and transphobic violence. Law 1620 (from 2013) and the Regulatory Decree (1965) establish minimal norms for applying the Integral Roadmap for Educational Community Living and its protocols, in order to prevent and mitigate situations affecting school community living and the exercising of human, sexual and reproductive rights.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In Honduras, the Law Against Bullying was adopted in 2014. However, it does not refer to particular motives for bullying.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In Peru, the General Law on Education (2003) establishes that integral sexuality education is part of the right to education. A Law promoting violence-free community living in educational institutions (29719) exists (2011), although it does not refer to homophobic or transphobic violence.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Cuba, El Salvador and Peru guarantee the right to comprehensive sexuality education, which should cover issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

As with other regions of the world, although these rights-based policies are on the statute books in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, a regional survey of 19 states – conducted by the Inter-American Institute for Human Rights in 2011 – noted that, in the majority of cases, they are not rigorously implemented and are 'always very general, dispersed, and in some cases ambiguous'.&lt;ref&gt;IIDH, 'Informe Interamericano de la Educación en Derechos Humanos Un estudio en 19 países: Desarrollo en las políticas de convivencia y seguridad escolar con enfoque de derechos', Instituto Interamericano de Derechos Humanos, San Jose, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Europe ===
In Europe, some countries have specific laws and policies to address homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings. In Belgium, the Flemish Ministry for Education and Equal Opportunities issued a Common Declaration for a Gender-Sensitive and LGBT Friendly Policy in Schools in 2012, establishing a framework for sexuality education and providing guidelines for schools to develop LGBT-inclusive policies.&lt;ref&gt;Flemish Department of Education, 'Gender aware and LGBT friendly policies in education', Brussels, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flemish Government, 'The Common Declaration for a Gender Sensitive and LGBT Friendly Policy in Schools', 2012. [Online]. Available: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unece.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; leadmin/DAM/env/ esd/11thMeetSC/Documents/2015_Good_practices_gender_in_ESD_BE_Flanders.pdf. [Accessed: 13-Aug-2012].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In France, although no national policy mentions homophobic and transphobic violence, the [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of Education's]] annual letter to principals has, since 2009, mentioned combating homophobia. Also, a 2012 governmental plan to combat homophobic and transphobic violence foresees specific actions in the education sector.&lt;ref&gt;Republique Française, 'Programme d'actions gouvernemental contre les violences et les discriminations commises à raison de l'orientation sexuelle ou de l'identité de genre', Premier Ministre, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In Portugal, the Students' Statute (2012) includes protection against discrimination based on both sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. In Sweden, the Discrimination Act (2009) explicitly bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in education, and obliges pre-schools, schools and universities to take proactive measures against violence. The United Kingdom's [[Equality Act 2010|Equality Act]] (2010) makes it a duty for schools to advance equality for their LGBT students. The Act explicitly mentions sexual orientation and gender reassignment and mandates that every school should have a behaviour policy preventing all forms of bullying.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Mitchell, M. Gray, K. Green, and K. Beninger, 'What works in tackling homophobic, biphobic and transphobic (HBT) bullying among and young people? Evidence review and typology of initiatives', Government Equalities Of ce, London, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== The Pacific ===
In the Pacific, Australia's 2013 Sex Discrimination Act (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) builds on previous state-level legislation and provides protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity/expression and intersex status (although some exemptions exist for some religious schools).&lt;ref&gt;T. Jones, Policy and Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Students. Cham, Heidelberg, New York, Dordrecht and London: Springer International Publishing, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Australia, the State of Victoria's Department of Education and Early Childhood Development provides guidance to support [[sexual diversity]] in schools.&lt;ref&gt;DoEECD, 'Supporting Sexual Diversity in schools', Student Wellbeing &amp; Health Support Division Of ce for Government School Education Department of Education and Early Childhood Development Melbourne, Melbourne, State of Victoria, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In Fiji, the 2015 Policy on Child Protection in Schools requires schools to respect children's sexual orientation and to take action against bullying, including homophobic bullying. In New Zealand, the Ministry of Education published a Guide for Sexuality Education (2015) stating that school anti-bullying procedures should directly address bullying related to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression and that these incidents should be recorded as such and monitored. The comprehensive guidance also touches upon the curriculum, school uniforms, restroom facilities, procedures and policies in sports and extra-curricular activities.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other countries in the region offer limited protection from school-related violence. Papua New Guinea alone specifically forbids such practice, while other countries protect children's health in general or offer only limited protection to children (in Tonga).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Africa ===
In Africa, a review of policies on gender, diversity and violence in schools in Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland – conducted within the study supported by [[UNESCO]] in 2015 – found that countries have generic legal and policy frameworks (including in education) that provide a conducive environment to address violence in schools. In Lesotho and Swaziland, they are mostly related to child protection. Swaziland has an education sector policy where Schools as Centres of Care and Support (SCCS) are supposed to be 'protective and secure environments which accommodate all learners'. In Botswana and Namibia, [[Education For All|Education for All]] National Action Plans and other education policies clearly mention inclusive and non-discriminatory education. However, none of these policies make reference to sexual and gender diversity, except for South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, 'Gender, diversity and violence in schools in five countries in Southern Africa: Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland (draft)', UNESCO, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Only South Africa has explicit policies to deal with homophobic bullying in education. The UNESCO-supported study found that, in interview, national policy-makers in Southern Africa suggest that the overall absence of specific policies may reflect the lack of reliable evidence on the nature, prevalence and impact of homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings in the region, or that it is not considered a political priority. Where specific national legislation or policies (including in the education sector) are lacking, other entry points may exist to address homophobic and transphobic violence in educational institutions. These include international or regional human rights frameworks, but also general laws and policies against violence in educational institutions (for which additional guidance can be produced to detail how they apply to homophobic and transphobic violence). Finally, national anti-discrimination laws in Southern Africa (whether or not they mention sexual orientation and gender identity/expression) may also provide good entry points for the education sector to consider adopting new policies or upgrading existing ones.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Relevant curricula and learning materials ==
{{See also|Gender inequality in curricula}}

The second element of a comprehensive response to homophobic and transphobic violence in educational settings is relevant curricula and learning materials. Through their content and the way that they are delivered, curricula, learning materials and extra-curricular activities in educational settings – such as sports or theatre – convey influential messages about 'normality', legitimacy and power. Curricula are never neutral. Those that do not feature sexual and gender diversity convey the implicit message that people with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities/expressions are not part of society. Worse still, some curricula may explicitly convey negative messages about LGBTI people.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Curricula generally take one of four approaches for sexual and gender diversity:
* '''{{'}}Hostile' curricula:''' i.e. they explicitly convey negative messages about LGBTI people, which reinforce negative gender stereotypes and contribute to homophobic and transphobic violence. For example textbooks were withdrawn by the government in Croatia (in 2009) and Macedonia (in 2010) because they described homosexuality as a disease.
* '''{{'}}Non-inclusive' curricula:''' These omit any representation of sexual and gender diversity in their materials and, for example, ignore these aspects when discussing historical  gures who were LGBTI. This has the result of rendering LGBTI people 'invisible'. Most curricula worldwide fall into this category.
* '''{{'}}Inclusive' curricula:''' These convey implicit positive messages about sexual and gender diversity when they promote the human rights of all, regardless of personal characteristics including sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. These curricula are likely to also encourage gender equality.
* '''{{'}}Affirming' curricula:''' These convey explicit positive messages about sexual and gender diversity by featuring positive representations of LGBTI people and explicitly af rming their equality in dignity and rights. They provide educators with clear  guidelines and examples on how to refer to sexual orientation and gender identity/expression in a sensitive way.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; 
Hostile and non-inclusive curricula tend to exist in contexts where homophobia and transphobia are widespread. They do nothing to prevent or reduce violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. On the contrary, hostile curricula contribute to reinforcing stereotypical and patriarchal views of gender – indirectly leading to homophobic and transphobic violence. Meanwhile, by not challenging these stereotypical and patriarchal views, non-inclusive curricula also contribute to homophobic and transphobic violence in educational institutions. In contrast, inclusive or af rming curricula may discuss de nitions of masculinity and femininity and challenge existing stereotypes about gender and sexuality – contributing to increasing LGBTI students' feeling of belonging and safety.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kosciw, E. A. Greytak, N. A. Palmer, and M. J. Boesen, 'The 2013 National School Climate Survey: The experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Youth in Our Nation's Schools', Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network, New York, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;F. Bucx, F. Van Der Sman, and C. Jalvingh, 'Different class - Evaluation of the pilot Social safety of LGBT children at school: Summary and Conclusions', The Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Research suggests that curricula featuring sexual orientation and gender identity/expression positively impact students' and teachers' beliefs and attitudes, encouraging critical thinking and increasing feelings of safety at school.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They also help to address violence. The literature confirms that challenging homophobia and transphobia in education is most effective when LGBTI issues are reflected and featured through teaching and lesson plans, and when LGBTI people are positively portrayed across the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;I.

In [[Sociology|social]], [[Cultural studies|cultural]] and [[religious studies]], the "'''epic of evolution'''" is a [[narrative]] that blends religious and scientific views of [[Cosmology|cosmic]], [[Biological evolution|biological]] and [[sociocultural evolution]] in a [[Mythology|mythological]] manner. According to ''Taylor's Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature'', an "epic of evolution" encompasses
{{quote|the 14 billion year narrative of cosmic, planetary, life, and cultural evolution—told in sacred ways. Not only does it bridge mainstream science and a diversity of religious traditions; if skillfully told, it makes the science story memorable and deeply meaningful, while enriching one's religious faith or secular outlook.&lt;ref&gt;''The Epic of Evolution'', 2004 [http://www.religionandnature.com/ern/ ''Taylor's Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== History ==
[[File:Plos wilson.jpg|thumb|upright|[[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]] coined the phrase "evolutionary epic" in 1978.]]

"Epic of evolution" seems to have originated from the [[Sociobiology|sociobiologist]] [[E. O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]]'s use of the phrase "evolutionary epic" in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;E. O. Wilson coined the term "evolutionary epic"– Teilhard Perspective, Volume 30 #2 Fall 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The evolutionary epic is probably the best myth we will ever have." ''On Human Nature'', [[E. O. Wilson]], 1978, p 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was not the first to use the term but his prominence prompted its usage as the morphed phrase 'epic of evolution'. In later years, he also used the latter term.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|last=Novacek |first=Michael J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/americasbest/science.medicine/pro.eowilson.html |title=Lifetime achievement: E.O. Wilson |work= |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=2006-11-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014091550/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/americasbest/science.medicine/pro.eowilson.html |archivedate=2006-10-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturalistic and liberal religious writers have picked up on Wilson's term and have used it in a number of texts. These authors however have at times used other terms to refer to the idea: ''Universe Story'' ([[Brian Swimme]], [[John F. Haught]]), ''Great Story'' (Connie Barlow, [[Michael Dowd]]), ''Everybody's Story'' ([[Loyal Rue]]&lt;ref&gt;Rue, Loyal.  ''Everybody's Story: Wising Up to the Epic of Evolution'', SUNY Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-7914-4392-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;), ''New Story'' ([[Thomas Berry]], [[Al Gore]], Brian Swimme) and ''Cosmic Evolution'' ([[Eric Chaisson]]&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson, Eric. ''Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos'', Columbia University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-231-13560-2}}, paper978-0-231-13561-0&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Alfred K.  ''The Epic of Evolution, Its Etiology and Art: A Study of Vardis Fisher's Testament of Man'', University Microfilms International, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, James B. ''The Epic of Evolution: Science and Religion in Dialogue'', Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2003, {{ISBN|0-13-093318-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Gordon. ''The ''Epic of Evolution'' as a Framework for Human Orientation'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hefner. ''The Evolutionary Epic''. Zygon, vol.44 #1, March 2009, page 3. "An enormous amount of attention has been given to constructing this myth. Such efforts commonly go under the names 'evolutionary epic,' 'epic of evolution,' or 'epic of creation'."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative==
Evolution generally refers to biological [[evolution]], but here it means a [[process(science)|process]] in which the whole universe is a progression of interrelated phenomena, a gradual process&lt;ref&gt;J. C. Polkinghorne, ''The Work of Love: Creation as Kenosis'', Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2001, (Peacocke chapter) page 21, {{ISBN|0-8028-4885-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=fy1-hnYDHGIC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;vq=One+can+only+speak+of+creation+as+a+process&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1]&lt;/ref&gt; in which something changes into a different and usually more complex form ([[emergence]]). It should not be 'biologized' as it includes many areas of science.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley – [https://books.google.com/books?id=yaecVMhMWaEC&amp;dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+Christianity:,epic+of+evolution&amp;ei=TDbOSaGeLJ2EyATUoOmLCg ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''], Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2001, page 229, {{ISBN|90-04-11695-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, outside of the scientific community, the term evolution is frequently used differently from scientists' usage. Even respected dictionaries may present questionable definitions that are not scientific or only address genetic changes. Unfortunately it is common for the general public to enter into a discussion about evolution with a wrong definition in mind. This often leads to misunderstanding since scientists are viewing evolution from a different perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Moran – What is Evolution, 1993 [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-definition.html] retrieved 4-07-09&lt;/ref&gt; The same applies to the use of the term theory as used in the theory of evolution (see references for [[Evolution as theory and fact]]).

This epic is not a long narrative poem but a series of events that form the proper subject for a laudable kind of tale. It is mythic in that it is a story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the worldview of a people and explains a natural phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of myth that has an approach to investigation that is empirical or scientific.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthlight.org/interview26.html Epic of Evolution is definitely mythic – Brian Swimme interview]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joseph Campbell myths serve two purposes—provide meaning for a maturing individual (an individuate) and how to be part of a community. This Epic does both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://personallifemedia.com/podcasts/212-living-dialogues/episodes/2712-michael-dowd-great-story-epic Duncan Campbell in one of his interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The epic as myth==
Dr. [[William Grassie]] of Temple University writes that the word "[[myth]]" in common usage is usually misunderstood. In academia it defines "a story that serves to define the fundamental world view of a culture by explaining aspects of the natural world and delineating the psychological and social practices and ideals of a society". He suggests that the Greek term ''mythos'' would be a better term to apply to the Epic as it is more all-encompassing. He concluded that there is not yet an interpretive tradition within science and society about this epic of evolution. If anything, there is an anti-interpretation tradition. Consequently, this is dangerous as it is a powerful revelation at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Can the modern evolutionary cosmology be a mythic story for our time?[http://www.science-spirit.org/printerfriendly.php?article_id=29]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}- retrieved 3-22-09&lt;/ref&gt; Grassie says the Epic is complex and multifaceted, not simple or easy to understand. It takes a romantic vision, philosophical rigor, and artistic interpretations. It requires a consilience of modern disciplines and acceptance of social diversity. The ancient wisdoms of the world's spiritual traditions must be adapted to make the framework to weave the Epic.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Grassie]], Science and Spirit 1998, 9(1) – page 6 of this ref- [http://www.thegreatstory.org/ClassicQuotes.pdf Science and Spirit] retrieved 3-16-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations of the epic==
&lt;!-- Please attempt to keep this to a paragraph per 'interpretation' --&gt;
[[E. O. Wilson]] explained that humans had a need for the epic of evolution because they must have a mythical story or a sublime account of how the world was created and how humanity became part of it. Religious epics fulfill a primal need in this respect as they verify that humans are part of something greater than themselves. The best empirical knowledge that science and history can provide is necessary in order to provide a comparable epic tale that will reliably unite a separated human spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Edward O. Wilson, Foreword of ''Everybody's Story: Wising Up to the Epic of Evolution'' By Loyal D. Rue, SUNY Press, 1999, page ix and x,{{ISBN|0-7914-4392-2}},&lt;/ref&gt; He believes the evolutionary epic can be as inherently noble as any religious epic when it is expressed in a poetic way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreatstory.org/ClassicQuotes.pdf  Edward O. Wilson, Consilience 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, biologist Ursula Goodenough sees the tale of natural emergence as far more magical than traditional religious miracles. It is a story that people can work with in a  religious way if they elect to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Goodenough – Sacred Depths of Nature, Oxford University Press, USA; 1 edition (June 15, 2000), {{ISBN|0-19-513629-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Hefner]] uses the analogy of weaving to describe the Epic. The warp anchors the story and the weft creates the pattern and the tapestry. The Epic, as scientists see it, is the warp and the weft forms the pattern as each of us views it (we are all weavers) but the patterns all have the warp in common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreatstory.org/ClassicQuotes.pdf Classic Quotations – Philip Hefner, 1997 AAAS Epic of Evolution Conference ]&lt;/ref&gt; Hefner writes that stories about the evolutionary epic are redolent with ultimacy.{{Clarify|date=September 2009}}  It is not science; it is scientifically informed myth, a myth driven by the refusal to give up on the insistence that the natural world and our lives in the world have meaning and purpose. It is a mythical tale of irony and hope that fills a large space in the domain of religion-and-science.&lt;ref&gt;Hefner – The Evolutionary Epic – Zygon, vol.44 #1, March 2009, page 5,6&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[Ursula Goodenough]] also makes use of Hefner's weaving metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Goodenough – ''The Sacred Depths of Nature'', Oxford University Press US, 1998, page 272, {{ISBN|0-19-512613-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connie Barlow and [[Michael Dowd]]'s Great Story divides the epic into 8 phases eons or eras: the [[Big bang|Great Radiance]], the Galactic, [[Hadean]], [[Archean]], [[Proterozoic]], [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]], and [[Cenozoic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreatstory.org/timeline.html  Great Story Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; Dowd uses the term 'epic of evolution' to help construct his viewpoint of evolution theology (a form of [[theistic evolution]]). His position is that science and religious faith are not mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thankgodforevolution.com/node/1128 Evolution Theology: Religion 2.0]&lt;/ref&gt; He preaches that the epic of cosmic, biological, and human evolution, revealed by science, is a basis for an inspiring and meaningful view of our place in the universe. Evolution is viewed as a spiritual process that it is not meaningless blind chance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thankgodforevolution.com/book Thank God for Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Loyal Rue]] states that there is nothing in the core of everybody's story to rule out belief in a personal deity. However belief in God is not an indispensable part of this narrative and here will be both theistic and non-theistic versions of it.&lt;ref&gt;Loyal Rue – Everybody's Story: Wising Up to the Epic of Evolution, SUNY Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-7914-4392-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says it is the fundamental story of matter, created from energy, the organization of that matter into complex conditions, and then via self-organization into diverse life forms. Humans are as other living things—we are by nature star-born, earth-formed, fitness-maximized, biochemical systems. An aspect of the Epic is the evolution of behavior by that biochemical system.&lt;ref&gt;Loyal Rue – ''Religion is not About God'', Rutgers University Press, 2006, Part 1.1, {{ISBN|0-8135-3955-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Swimme]] sees the Epic as a way to gently maneuver a person into the magnificence of the Universe and as an antidote to the unhealthy consciousness of consumerism. It is the way into the future and enabled him to comprehend the cultural significance of this new story of science moving away from a materialistic worldview. It may move science away from its traditional abstractness to the uniqueness found in natural history. To him evolution and creativity are equivalent so it could be the Epic of Creativity (similar to Gordon Kaufman's thinking). Although the Epic is scientific, it is 'definitely mythic'—it has the fundamental nature of being mythic. "You take hydrogen gas, and you leave it alone, and it turns into rosebuds, giraffes and humans."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brianswimme.org/media/excerpts.asp  Center for the Story of the Universe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801065326/http://www.brianswimme.org/media/excerpts.asp |date=2009-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon D. Kaufman]] sees the Epic as a serendipitous creative process. He states that it is a notion that can interpret the enormous expansion and complexification of the physical universe (from the Big Bang outward), as well as the evolution of life here on earth and the gradual emergence of human historical existence. The whole vast process manifests (in varying degrees) serendipitous creativity, an everflowing coming into being of new modes of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Kaufman  –  ''God, mystery, diversity: Christian theology in a pluralistic world'', Fortress Press, 1996, page 101–102, {{ISBN|0-8006-2959-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=uYKDqTUfshQC] retrieved 3-17-09&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''In the beginning—creativity'', he says this creative process is God. Creativity, as metaphor, and as defined in the concept of evolution, has possibilities for constructing a new concept of God. The most foundational kind of creativity is found in that of cosmos/biological evolution—a paradigm that is now the organizing principle of all the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Kaufman – ''In the beginning—creativity'', Fortress Press, 2004, page x,33,57,137, {{ISBN|0-8006-6093-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=4wMcBvErCX0C] retrieved 3-17-09]&lt;/ref&gt; It would seem as though he was equating God to the evolutionary story. This is similar to Dowd who sees the facts of Nature as God's native tongue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thankgodforevolution.com/node/1634 evolutionary evangelist] retrieved 2009-02-01&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Chaisson]] orients his view of the epic around an "arrow of time",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/fr_1/fr_1_intro_movies.html Two movies: Arrow of Time and Cosmic Origins]&lt;/ref&gt; which he divides into 'Seven Ages of the Cosmos': particulate, galactic, stellar, planetary, chemical, biological, and cultural.&lt;ref&gt;Chaisson – Epic of Evolution: Seven Ages of the Cosmos, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/cosmic_evolution/docs/splash.html Cosmic Evolution]&lt;/ref&gt; However, such a thermodynamic arrow is not intended to be directional, a common misunderstanding; he sees no purpose, plan, or design in evolution, which he regards as unceasing, uncaring, and unpredictable. Chaisson’s strictly scientific analysis of evolution in its broadest sense—[[Cosmic Evolution (book)|cosmic evolution)]]—implies an unidirectional, meandering process extending from the big bang to humankind on Earth, and continuing while likely producing increasing complexity, perhaps forever, to ends unknown. As a physicist, he is perhaps best known for attempting to quantify the epic of evolution, using the currently known laws of science and the scientific method (with its insistence on experimental tests of all ideas, principally those of [[energy rate density]]) in order to empirically discriminate between objective sense and subjective nonsense. What emerges is a grand and inspiring ''scientific'' narrative of who we are and whence we came—the most recent and up-to-date version of this work having been summarized in a long peer-review article.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~ejchaisson/reprints/big_history_review_Chaisson_TSWJ2014.pdf "The Natural Science Underlying Big History,"] ''The Scientific World Journal'', v 2014, 41 pgs, 2014; DOI:10.1155/2014/384912.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation-evolution controversy==
{{Main|Creation-evolution controversy}}
The creation-evolution controversy goes beyond the field of [[evolutionary biology]] and  includes many fields of science (cosmology, geology, paleontology, thermodynamics, physics and sociobiology).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/index.html ''An Index to Creationist Claims''] , Mark Isaak, [[Talkorigins Archive]],Copyright © 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in the scientific community there is essentially universal agreement that the [[evidence of evolution]] is overwhelming, and the consensus supporting the [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian evolutionary synthesis]] is nearly absolute,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm |last=Delgado |first=Cynthia |title=Finding evolution in medicine |journal=NIH Record |volume=58 |issue=15 |accessdate=2007-10-22 |date=2006-07-28 |format=hmtl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122022815/http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2006/07_28_2006/story03.htm |archivedate=2008-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dover_pg83"&gt;[[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v.

The debate is sometimes portrayed as being between science and religion. However, as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] states:
{{quote|Today, many religious denominations accept that biological evolution has produced the diversity of living things over billions of years of Earth’s history. Many have issued statements observing that evolution and the tenets of their faiths are compatible. Scientists and theologians have written eloquently about their awe and wonder at the history of the universe and of life on this planet, explaining that they see no conflict between their faith in God and the evidence for evolution. Religious denominations that do not accept the occurrence of evolution tend to be those that believe in strictly literal interpretations of religious texts.|''Science, Evolution, and Creationism'', National Academy of Sciences&lt;ref&gt;

Dr.[[John Haught]],  Roman Catholic theologian, in his ''Science and Religion: from Conflict to Conversation'' suggests a theistic acceptance of the Epic. He says contemporary theology is being changed by evolutionary science. There are many versions undergoing constant revision. He considers evolution to be, at least provisionally, a most appropriate and fruitful scientific framework within which to think about God today and deplores that contemporary theology gets hung up in the creationism controversy.&lt;ref&gt;John F. Haught – ''Science and Religion: from conflict to conversation'', Paulist Press, 1995, page 69, {{ISBN|0-8091-3606-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=1Y9JMBqvGlMC]&lt;/ref&gt; There are liberal congregations these days that may see the epic of evolution as a history about life and the universe that is both scientific and sacred.

Not all of the Epic's advocates are distinguished scientists. Some are Christians who consider it a 'narrative of mythic proportions' that contain religious aspects. They see it as a multifaceted concept that has been in Christian theology implicitly for hundreds of years and is congenial to perspectives that include ultimacy, transcendence, purpose and morality. However, there are both humanists and creationists who dispute this stance, making unclear the many varied theological stories of our world.&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley – [https://books.google.com/books?id=yaecVMhMWaEC&amp;dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+Christianity:,epic+of+evolution&amp;ei=TDbOSaGeLJ2EyATUoOmLCg ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''], Wm.

{{Wiktionary|fine}}

A '''fine''' or '''mulct''' is money that a [[court of law]] or other [[authority]] decides has to be paid as punishment for a [[crime]] or other [[Offense (law)|offence]]. The amount of a fine can be determined case by case, but it is often announced in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1967184|last=Bray |first=Samuel |year=2012 |title=Announcing Remedies |journal=Cornell Law Review |volume=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wheel Clamp warning sign.JPG|thumb|150px|A warning sign in Singapore that states the fine for releasing vehicles that are immobilized with wheel clamps by Singapore Police Force officers.]]

The most usual use of the term is for [[financial]] punishments for the commission of crimes, especially minor crimes, or as the [[settlement (law)|settlement]] of a [[Claim (legal)|claim]]. A synonym, typically used in [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] actions, is '''mulct'''.

One common example of a fine is money paid for violations of [[traffic]] laws.  Currently in [[English law|English common law]], relatively [[Standard scale|small fines]] are used either in place of or alongside [[community service order]]s for low-level criminal offences. Larger fines are also given independently or alongside shorter [[prison]] sentences when the [[judge]] or magistrate considers a considerable amount of retribution is necessary, but there is unlikely to be significant danger to the public. For instance, [[fraud]] is often punished by very large fines since fraudsters are typically banned from the position or [[profession]] they abused to commit their crimes.

Fines can also be used as a form of [[tax]]. Money for [[bail]] may be applied toward a fine.

A [[day-fine]] is a fine that, above a minimum, is based on personal income.

Some fines are small, such as for [[loitering]], for which fines range from about $25 to $100. In some areas of the [[United States]] (for example [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Texas]], and [[Washington D.C.]]), fines for petty crimes, such as [[criminal mischief]] (shouting in public places, projecting an object at a police car) range from $2500 to $5000.

==Fines by country==

===England and Wales===
In the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], unless the context otherwise requires, the expression "fine", except for the purposes of any enactment imposing a limit on the amount of any fine, includes any pecuniary penalty or pecuniary forfeiture or pecuniary compensation payable under a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/43/section/150 section 150(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In section 32 of that Act, the expression  "fine" includes a pecuniary penalty but does not include a pecuniary forfeiture or pecuniary compensation.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/43/section/32 section 32(9)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In sections 15 to 32 and 48 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]], the expression "fine" includes any pecuniary penalty.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Law Act 1977]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/45/section/65 section 65(2)] (as amended by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/43/schedule/7/paragraph/153 paragraph 153] of Schedule 7 to the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]]). This definition previously applied to section 14 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 before it was repealed by the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, there is now a system whereby the court gives the offender a 'fine card' which is somewhat like a [[credit card]]; at any shop that has a paying-in machine he pays the value of the fine to the shop, which then uses the fine card to pass that money on to the court's [[bank account]].

A related concept is the [[fixed penalty notice]], a pecuniary penalty for some minor crimes that can be either accepted (instead of prosecution, thus saving time and paperwork, or taken to court for normal proceedings for that crime. While technically not a fine, which, under the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], may be levied only following a conviction, it serves the same purpose of punishment.

Early examples of fines include the [[weregild]] or [[Blood money (term)|blood money]] payable under [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[common law]] for causing a death. The murderer would be expected to pay a sum of money or goods dependent on the social status of the victim.

===The Netherlands===

====Criminal law====

=====General information=====
The Dutch Criminal Code ''(Dutch: Wetboek van Strafrecht (WvSr))'' doesn't contain specific amounts for fines for every violation of the law. Instead of that the Criminal Code provides six fine categories. Every penalty clause of the Criminal Code contains a fine category. The categories are:

{| class="wikitable"

|-
|First

|-
|Second
|€4.100
|$2.800
|-
|Third
|€8.200
|$5.600

|-
|Fifth
|€82.000
|$56.000
|-
|Sixth
|€820.000
|$560.000
|}

These sums are only an upper limit, it's up to the judge or the prosecutor to determine the exact sum of the fine. However, the amount of the fine must be at least €3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel23|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sums of categories are always 1, 10, 20, 50, 200 and 2000 times the amount of the first category. In addition to the fine, the convict also has to pay an administration fee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0006717/2014-06-07#Paragraaf3a_Artikel9b|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Besluit tenuitvoerlegging geldboeten - BWBR0006717|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; of €9.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2015-37447.html|title=Regeling van de Staatssecretaris van Veiligheid en Justitie van 19 oktober 2015 tot wijziging van de Regeling vaststelling administratiekosten 2012|first=Ministerie van Veiligheid en|last=Justitie|website=zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amounts are established by the government, via a royal order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel23|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the judge convicts an individual to a fine, the judge must also set a term of substitute imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel24c|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; This substitute imprisonment will be executed in the case that the fine remains unpaid. The judge may count one day imprisonment for every unpaid €25,&lt;ref name="overheid.nl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel24c|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; however normally judges reckon one day for every €50 which stays unpaid. Though, the substitute imprisonment must be at least one day (even though the fine was €3) and cannot exceed one year (even though the fine was €100.000).&lt;ref name="overheid.nl"/&gt;

=====Execution of a court imposed fine=====

Once a person is irrevocable convicted to a fine, it's up to the public prosecutor to collect the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel23|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, the cjib ''(centraal justiteel incassobureau (English: central judicial collection agency))'' is established.

First, the CJIB will send the convict the fine. If the convict pays the fine the case is closed (by paying, the convict loses the right to go into appeal as well), if he doesn't, the case will be continued. The CJIB will then send the convict a reminder, though this reminder will contain an increment of €15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel24b|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this doesn't lead to the payment of the fine, the CJIB will send another reminder, now with a raise of 20%, however, the raise must be at least €30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel24b|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fine continues to be unpaid, the CJIB will instruct a bailiff to collect the fine nonetheless. This bailiff may, for example, seize the convict's income and sell his possessions. If these measures do not result in the full collection of the fine, the bailiff will return the case to the prosecutor. The prosecutor will order the police to arrest the convict, in order to execute the earlier written substitute imprisonment. The length of the imprisonment will be percentage-wise reduced if the convict has paid a sum, but not the entire amount of the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001854/2016-07-01#BoekEerste_TiteldeelII_Artikel24c|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Wetboek van Strafrecht - BWBR0001854|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the substitute imprisonment the convict will be a free man again. He also won't have to pay the fine anymore and the case will be closed.

====Frequently committed traffic violations====

=====General information=====
Before 1 September 1990, all traffic violations were punished via the criminal law. The suspects were first offered a sort of plea bargain. This mostly contains a fine. If the suspect didn't pay the fine of this plea bargain, the public prosecutor had to open a criminal case, otherwise he wasn't authorized to collect the fine through force. The case had to be withdrawn when the capacity of the courts or the prosecutor's office didn't allow the start of a criminal case for a traffic violation. This was the case very often. This situation led to a negative spiral, because traffic offenders hoped and expected their case to be withdrawn, and didn't pay the plea bargain fine. This led to a growing pressure on the capacity of the courts, which causes more sepots (decisions not to prosecute). This encouraged more offenders not to pay, etc.

In order to stop this spiral, the secretary general of the justice department (at that time), Dr. Albert Mulder, designed a new system of law enforcement. Under this new system, the government acquired the right of summary foreclosure. The summary foreclosure means that the CJIB can execute the fine directly, unless the fined subject goes to appeal.

The system regarding frequently committed traffic violations is regulated by Administrative Enforcement of traffic Rules Act ''(Dutch: Wet administratiefrechtelijke handhaving verkeersvoorschriften (WAHV))''. According to the WAHV the maximum sum of the administrative fine is the same as the maximum amount of the first category (Art. 2 section 3 WvSr Criminal Code).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukII_Artikel2 Art. 2 section 3 WAHV]&lt;/ref&gt; The exact fine per violation is determined by an annex of the WAHV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukII_Artikel2 Art. 2 section 1 WAHV]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the fine, the fined subject will also have to pay €9&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; administration costs as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0006847/2014-06-07#Paragraaf5a_Artikel11a|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Besluit administratiefrechtelijke handhaving verkeersvoorschriften 1994 - BWBR0006847|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of the administration costs will also be determined by the minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2015-37447.html|title=Regeling van de Staatssecretaris van Veiligheid en Justitie van 19 oktober 2015 tot wijziging van de Regeling vaststelling administratiekosten 2012|first=Ministerie van Veiligheid en|last=Justitie|website=zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Process of the administrative fine=====
Once a subject has been fined by an officer or photographed by a speed camera, he will receive a decision within four months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukIII_Artikel4 Art. 4 section 2 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; This decision will contain a short description of the violation, the place and time the violation was committed and sum of the fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukIII_Artikel4 Art. 4 section 1 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt;
The subject will have two choices now. He can pay the fine or he can go into appeal. In contrast to the court imposed fine, when the subject has paid the fine, he will keep the right to go into appeal. The subject can go into appeal within six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0005537/2016-11-03#Hoofdstuk6_Afdeling6.2_Artikel6:7|title=wetten.nl - Regeling - Algemene wet bestuursrecht - BWBR0005537|website=wetten.overheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first instance, the subject appeals to the public prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukIV_Artikel6 Art. 6 section 1 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor shall withdraw the fine completely when he thinks the appellant has right. He will lower the sum of the fine if he thinks that the suspect is partially right. If the prosecutor thinks that the suspect isn't right, he will uphold the fine. As long as the prosecutor has not made a decision on the appeal, the suspect does not have to pay the fine yet.

Once the prosecutor has made a decision, the suspect will again have two choices. He can pay or he goes into appeal at the sub-district judge of his arrondissement (or the arrondissement of the place where the disputed violation was committed).

He can withdraw the fine, lower the fine, or uphold the fine.

If the (remaining) fine is higher than €70 and the suspect or/nor the prosecutor doesn't agree with the sub-district judge's verdict, the suspect or the prosecutor can go into appeal for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukV_Artikel11 Art. 14 section 1 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; He does that at the court of appeal of Arnhem-Leeuwarden in Leeuwarden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukVI_Artikel14 Art. 14 section 1 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; This appeal will be in writing, unless the appellant, per se, wants to do it orally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0004581/2016-01-01#HoofdstukV_Artikel11 Art. 20a section 1 Wahv]&lt;/ref&gt; If the fine is lower than €70, or the appellant's appeal is rejected in Leeuwarden, there will be no legal remedies anymore and the case will be closed.

The '''Four Noble Truths''' refer to and express the basic orientation of [[Buddhism]]{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=59}} in a short expression:{{sfn|Norman|2003}}{{refn|group=note|name="Moksha"}} we [[Taṇhā|crave]] and [[Upādāna|cling]] to [[Saṅkhāra#Conditioned things|impermanent states and things]],{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=65}} which are ''[[dukkha]]'',{{sfn|Khantipalo|2003|p=41}} "incapable of satisfying"&lt;ref group=web name="Sumedho-first"/&gt; and painful.&lt;ref group=web name="Sumedho-first" /&gt;{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=65}}{{sfn|Emmanuel|2015|p=30}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=74-75}}{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=147}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-DL Four Truths" /&gt; This craving keeps us caught in ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|samsara]]'',{{refn|group=note|name="Samudaya"}} the endless cycle of repeated ''[[bhava]]'' ("becoming") and ''[[Jāti (Buddhism)|jāti]]'' (literally: "birth", interpreted as [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]), and the continued ''dukkha'' that comes with it.{{refn|group=note|name="Samsara"}} There is, however, a way to [[Moksha|end this cycle]],{{sfn|Warder|1999|p=45-46}}{{refn|group=note|name="Pleasure"}} namely by attaining ''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]]'', cessation of craving, whereafter birth and the accompanying ''dukkha'' will no longer arise again.{{refn|group=note|name="Nirodha"}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2003|p=304}} This can be accomplished by following the [[Noble Eightfold Path|eightfold path]],{{refn|group=note|name="Moksha"}} restraining oneself, cultivating discipline and wholesome states, and practicing [[mindfulness]] and ''[[Dhyana in Buddhism|dhyana]]''.{{sfn|Raju|1985|p=147–151}}{{sfn|Eliot|2014|p=39–41}}

In short form, the four truths are ''dukkha'', ''samudaya'' ("arising," "coming together"), ''nirodha'' ("cessation," "confinement"), and ''marga'', the path leading to cessation.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=219, 222}} As the "Four Noble Truths" ([[Sanskrit]]: ''catvāri āryasatyāni''; [[Pali]]: ''cattāri ariyasaccāni''), they are "the truths of the [[Arhat|Noble Ones]],"{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}} the truths or realities which are understood by the "worthy ones"&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Arhat"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34073/arhat Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Arhat (Buddhism)'']&lt;/ref&gt; who have attained nirvana.{{sfn|Warder|1999|p=67}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-Arhat" /&gt;

In the ''[[Buddhist texts|sutras]]'', Buddhist religious texts, the four truths have both a symbolic and a propositional function.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|pp=223-231}} They represent the awakening and liberation of the Buddha, but also the possibility of liberation for all sentient beings, describing how release from craving is to be reached.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=56}} In the [[Pali canon]] scriptures, the four truths appear in a "network of teachings,"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}} as part of "the entire ''[[Dharma#Buddhism|dhamma]]'' matrix,"{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=86}} which have to be taken together.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=85}} They provide a conceptual framework for introducing and explaining Buddhist thought, which has to be personally understood or "experienced".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} {{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=27-28}}&lt;ref group=web name="EB-DL Four Truths"/&gt;{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}{{refn|group=note|name="Gethin_framework"}}

The function of the four truths, and their importance, developed over time, when ''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]]'', or "liberating insight," came to be regarded as liberating in itself,{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99-100, 102-111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} instead of or in addition to the practice of ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]]'', meditation.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99-100, 102-111}} This "liberating insight" gained a prominent place in the sutras, and the four truths came to represent this liberating insight, as part of the enlightenment story of the Buddha.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=99-102}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}}

The four truths became of central importance in the [[Theravada]] tradition of Buddhism,{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55-56}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=230-231}} which holds to the idea that insight into the four truths is liberating in itself.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179}} They are less prominent in the [[Mahayana]] tradition, which sees the higher aims of insight into ''[[sunyata]]'', emptiness, and following the [[Bodhisattva path]] as central elements in their teachings and practice.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179-3180}} The Mahayana tradition reinterpreted the four truths to explain how a liberated being can still be "pervasively operative in this world."{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346-347}} Beginning with the exploration of Buddhism by [[Colonial India|western colonialists]] in the 19th century and the development of [[Buddhist modernism]], they came to be often presented in the west as the central teaching of Buddhism.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=72-73}}{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=196}}

==The four truths==

===Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta===
The four truths are best known from their presentation in the ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]'' text,{{refn|group=note|name="best-known"}} which contains two sets of the four truths,{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=295}}{{sfn|Norman|2003}} while various other sets can be found in the [[Pali Canon]], a collection of scriptures in the [[Theravadan]] Buddhist tradition.{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} According to the Buddhist tradition, the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', "Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion,"&lt;ref group=web name="Dhammacakka"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn56/sn56.011.than.html Thanissaro Bhikkhu, ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta: Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion - Majjhima Nikaya 56.11'']&lt;/ref&gt; contains the first teachings that the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] gave after attaining [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|full awakening]], and liberation from rebirth. According to [[L. S. Cousins]], many scholars are of the view that "this discourse was identified as the first sermon of the Buddha only at a later date,"{{sfn|Cousins|2002|p=3}} and according to professor of religion Carol S. Anderson{{refn|group=note|Professor of religion, Kalamazoo College; Co-Editor of the Journal of Buddhist-Christian Studies.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://www.society-buddhist-christian-studies.org/partners/ ''Governing Board of the Society for Buddhist-Christian studies'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://www.society-buddhist-christian-studies.org/carol-anderson ''Carol Anderson'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} the four truths may originally not have been part of this sutta, but were later added in some versions.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=68}} Within this discourse, the four noble truths are given as follows ("bhikkus" is normally translated as "Buddhist monks"):
{{quote| Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering; union with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the [[Skandha|five aggregates]] subject to clinging are suffering.

Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this craving [''[[taṇhā]]'', "thirst"] which [[Twelve Nidānas|leads to re-becoming]], accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for becoming, craving for disbecoming.

Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non-reliance on it.

Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: it is this noble eightfold path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.&lt;ref group=web name="BB"&gt;[http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebsut001.htm Bikkhu Bodhi (translator), ''Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta. Samyutta Nikaya LVI, 11. "Setting in Motion the Wheel of the Dhamma."'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to this sutra, with the complete comprehension of these four truths release from ''samsara'', the cycle of rebirth, was attained:
{{quote|Knowledge &amp; vision arose in me: 'Unprovoked is my release. This is the last birth. There is now no further becoming.&lt;ref group=web name="Dhammacakka"/&gt;}}

The comprehension of these four truths by his audience leads to the opening of the ''Dhamma Eye'', that is, the attainment of right vision:
{{quote|Whatever is subject to origination is subject to cessation.&lt;ref group=web name="Dhammacakka"/&gt;}}

===Mnemonic set===
According to [[K. R. Norman]], the Pali canon contains various shortened forms of the four truths, the "mnemonic set," which were "intended to remind the hearer of the full form of the NTs."{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=213}} The earliest form of the mnemonic set was "dukkham samudayo nirodho magga," without the reference to the [[Pali]] terms ''sacca''{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=219}} or ''arya'',{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}} which were later added to the formula.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}} The four mnemonic terms can be translated as follows:
# ''[[Dukkha]]'' - "incapable of satisfying,"&lt;ref group=web name="Sumedho-first"&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/4noble4.htm Ajahn Sumedho, ''The First Noble Truth'']&lt;/ref&gt; "the unsatisfactory nature and the general insecurity of all [[Saṅkhāra#Conditioned things|conditioned phenomena]]"; "painful."{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980|p=65}}{{sfn|Emmanuel|2015|p=30}} ''Dukkha'' is most commonly translated as "suffering". According to Khantipalo, this is an incorrect translation, since it refers to the ultimately unsatisfactory nature of temporary states and things, including pleasant but temporary experiences.{{sfn|Khantipalo|2003|p=46}} According to Emmanuel, ''Dukkha'' is the opposite of ''sukha'', "pleasure," and it is better translated as "pain."{{sfn|Emmanuel|2015|p=30}}
# ''[[Samudaya]]'' - "origin", "source", "arising", "coming to existence";&lt;ref group=web name=DigitalLibrary&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120611220213/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/DBLM/olcourse/sanskrit/heart/heart16.htm Digital Library &amp; Museum of Buddhist Studies, College of liberal Arts, Taiwan University: Samudaya]&lt;/ref&gt; "aggregate of the constituent elements or factors of any being or existence", "cluster", "coming together", "combination", "producing cause", "combination", "rising."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+samudaya&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Sanskrit Dictionary for spoken Sanskrit, ''samudaya'']&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Nirodha'' - cessation; release; to confine;{{sfn|Brazier|2001}} "prevention, suppression, enclosing, restraint"&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?beginning=0+&amp;tinput=+nirodha&amp;trans=Translate spokensanskrit.de, ''nirodha'']&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Noble Eightfold Path|Marga]]'' - "path."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/glossary.html#m Access to Insight Glossary - m]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Full set===
This full set, which is most commonly used in modern expositions,{{refn|group=note|name="best-known"|For example:&lt;br&gt;
* Ven. Dr. Rewata Dhamma: The Four Noble Truths [...] are: 1. The Noble Truth of Suffering (''dukkha''); 2. The Noble Truth of the origin of suffering (''samudaya''); 3. The Noble Truth of the cessation of suffering (''nirodha''); 4. The Noble Truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering (''magga'').{{sfn|Dhamma|1997|p=55}}
* Bhikkhu Bodhi: "The Four Noble Truths are as follows: 1. The truth of Dukkha; 2. The truth of the origin of Dukkha; 3. The truth of the cessation of Dukkha; 4. The truth of the path, the way to liberation from Dukkha".&lt;ref group=web name=bodhi1/&gt;
* Geshe Tashi Tsering: "The four noble truths are: 1. The noble truth of suffering; 2. The noble truth of the origin of suffering; 3. The noble truth of the cessation of suffering and the origin of suffering; 4. The noble truth of the path that leads to the cessation of suffering and the origin of suffering."{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 246-250}}
* Joseph Goldstein: "The four noble truths are the truth of suffering, its cause, its end, and the path to that end.{{sfn|Goldstein|2002|p=24}}}} contains grammatical errors, pointing to multiple sources for this set and translation problems within the ancient Buddhist community. Nevertheless, they were considered correct by the Pali tradition, which didn't correct them.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}} According to K.R. Norman, the basic set is as follows:{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=219, 222}}
* idam dukkham, "this is pain"
* ayam dukkha-samudayo, "this is the origin of pain"
* ayam dukkha-nirodha, "this is the cessation of pain"
* ayam dukkha-nirodha-gamini patipada, "this is the path leading to the cessation of pain."  The key terms in the longer version of this expression, ''dukkha-nirodha-gamini Patipada'', can be translated as follows:
:* ''Gamini'': leading to, making for&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=pali&amp;query=g%C4%81min%C4%AB&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 Pali Text Society Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;
:* ''Patipada'': road, path, way; the means of reaching a goal or destination&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/glossary.html#pq Access to Insight Glossary - pq]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative formulations===
According to L.S. Cousins, the four truths are not restricted to the well-known form where ''dukkha'' is the subject. Other forms take "the world, the arising of the world" or "the [[Asava|āsavas]], the arising of the āsavas" as their subject. According to Cousins, "the well-known form is simply shorthand for all of the forms."{{sfn|Cousins|2001|p=36}} "The world" refers to the [[saṅkhāra]]s, that is, all compounded things,&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/7.2-Rohitassa-S-s2.26-piya.pdf The Dharmafarers, ''Rhitassa Sutra'' (Samyutta Nikaya 2.26)]&lt;/ref&gt; or to the [[Ayatana|six sense spheres]].{{sfn|Choong|2000|p=84}}

The various terms all point to the same basic idea of Buddhism, as described in [[Skandha|five skandhas]] and [[Twelve Nidānas|twelve nidānas]]: sense-contact with objects leads to sensation, perception, [[Saṅkhāra]] ('inclinations', c.q. craving etc.), and consciousness. The ''Twelve Nidānas'' describe how this also leads to rebirth: from sensation comes craving, from craving comes karma, from karma comes rebirth. The aim of the Buddhist path is to reverse this causal chain: when there is no (response to) sensation, there is no craving, no karma, no rebirth.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2000|p=840}}{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=55-59}}

===Truths for the noble ones===
The Pali terms ''ariya sacca'' (Sanskrit: ''arya satya'') are commonly translated as "noble truths". This translation is a convention started by the earliest translators of Buddhist texts into English. According to K.R. Norman, this is just one of several possible translations.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}} According to [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]],{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}
{{quote|[T]here is no particular reason why the Pali expression ariyasaccani should be translated as 'noble truths'. It could equally be translated as 'the nobles' truths', or 'the truths for nobles', or 'the nobilising truths', or 'the truths of, possessed by, the noble ones' [...] In fact the Pali expression (and its Sanskrit equivalent) can mean all of these, although the Pali commentators place 'the noble truths' as the least important in their understanding.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}}}

The term "arya" was later added to the four truths.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}}{{sfn|Analayo|2013|p=15}} The term ''[[Arya (Buddhism)|ariya]]'' (Sanskrit: ''arya'') can be translated as "noble", "not ordinary", "valuable", "precious".{{refn|group=note|Ajahn Sucitto states: "So the four truths (ariya sacca) are generally called “noble” truths, although one might also translate ariya as “precious.” "{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|loc=Kindle Location 122}} }} "pure",{{sfn|Mingyur Rinpoche|2007|p=70}} Paul Williams:
{{quote|The Aryas are the noble ones, the saints, those who have attained 'the fruits of the path', 'that middle path the Tathagata has comprehended which promotes sight and knowledge, and which tends to peace, higher wisdom, enlightenment, and Nibbana'.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=52}}}}

The term ''[[satya|sacca]]'' (Sanskrit: ''[[satya]]'') is a central term in Indian thought and religion. It is typically translated as "truth"; but it also means "that which is in accord with reality", or "reality". According to [[Rupert Gethin]], the four truths are "four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}} They function as "a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}{{refn|group=note|name="Gethin_framework"|Gethin: "The word satya (Pali sacca) can certainly mean truth, but it might equally be rendered as 'real' or 'actual thing'. That is, we are not dealing here with propositional truths with which we must either agree or disagree, but with four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening. [...] This is not to say that the Buddha's discourses do not contain theoretical statements of the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation, but these descriptions function not so much as dogmas of the Buddhist faith as a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}}} According to K.R. Norman, probably the best translation is "the truth[s] of the noble one (the Buddha)."{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}} It is a statement of how things are seen by a Buddha, how things really are when seen correctly. It is the truthful way of seeing,{{refn|group=note|'"Truth", ''satya'' (Sanskrit), ''sacca'' (Pali), derived from ''sat'', being, how it is.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}}} Through not seeing things this way, and behaving accordingly, we suffer.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}{{refn|group=note|Contemporary Buddhist teacher [[Mingyur Rinpoche]] describes the four ''arya satya'' as "Four Pure Insights into the Way Things Are".{{sfn|Mingyur Rinpoche|2007|p=70}} Contemporary scholar Peter Harvey translates ''arya satya'' as "True Realities for the Spiritually Ennobled".{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=52}}}}

===Symbolic and propositional function===
[[File:Dharma Wheel.svg|thumb|right|150px|The [[Dharmacakra]], often used to represent the Noble Eightfold Path]]

According to Anderson, the four truths have both a symbolic and a propositional function:
{{quote|... the four noble truths are truly set apart within the body of the Buddha's teachings, not because they are by definition sacred, but because they are both a symbol and a doctrine and transformative within the sphere of right view. As one doctrine among others, the four noble truths make explicit the structure within which one should seek enlightenment; as a symbol, the four noble truths evoke the possibility of enlightenment. As both, they occupy not only a central but a singular position within the Theravada canon and tradition.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=230-231}}}}

As a symbol, they refer to the possibility of awakening, as represented by the Buddha, and are of utmost importance:
{{quote|[W]hen the four noble truths are regarded in the canon as the first teaching of the Buddha, they function as a view or doctrine that assumes a symbolic function.

The well-known eightfold path consists of the understanding that this world is fleeting and unsatisfying, and how craving keeps us tied to this fleeting world; a friendly and compassionate attitude to others; a correct way of behaving; mind-control, which means not feeding on negative thoughts, and nurturing positive thoughts; constant awareness of the feelings and responses which arise; and the practice of ''dhyana'', meditation.{{sfn|Bucknell|1984}} The tenfold path adds the right (liberating) insight, and liberation from rebirth.{{sfn|Bucknell|1984}}{{refn|group=note|Another variant, which may be condensed to the eightfold or tenfold path, starts with a Tathagatha entering this world.

{{quote|Once birth has arisen, ‘ageing and death’, and various other dukkha states follow. While saying that birth is the cause of death may sound rather simplistic, in Buddhism it is a very significant statement; for there is an alternative to being born. This is to attain Nirvāna, so bringing an end to the process of rebirth and redeath. Nirvāna is not subject to time and change, and so is known as the [[Anutpada|‘unborn’]]; as it is not born it cannot die, and so it is also known as the ‘deathless’. To attain this state, all phenomena subject to birth – the [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|khandhas]] and [[Nidana|nidānas]] – must be transcended by means of [[Nekkhamma|non-attachment]].{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=71-72}}}}

The last sermon, the ''[[Maha-parinibbana Sutta]]'' (Last Days of the Buddha, Digha Nikaya 16)", states it as follows:
{{quote|[...] it is through not realizing, through not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by you [...] But now, bhikkhus, that these have been realized and penetrated, cut off is the craving for existence, destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming [rebirth], and there is no fresh becoming.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html ''Maha-parinibbana Sutta: Last Days of the Buddha'', translated by Sister Vajira &amp; Francis Story]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other interpretations===
According to Bhikkhu [[Buddhadasa]], "birth" does refer not to physical birth and death, but to the birth and death of our self-concept, the "emergence of the ego". According to Buddhadhasa,
{{quote|...dependent arising is a phenomenon that lasts an instant; it is impermanent. Therefore, Birth and Death must be explained as phenomena within the process of dependent arising in everyday life of ordinary people. Right Mindfulness is lost during contacts of the Roots and surroundings. Thereafter, when vexation due to greed, anger, and ignorance is experienced, the ego has already been born. It is considered as one 'birth'".&lt;ref&gt;Buddhadhasa, Paticcasamuppada: Practical Dependent Origination, http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books6/Bhikkhu_Buddhadasa_Paticcasamuppada.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some contemporary teachers tend to explain the four truths psychologically, by taking ''dukkha'' to mean mental anguish in addition to the physical pain of life,{{sfn|Batchelor|2012|p=94}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2016|p=10}} and interpreting the four truths as a means to attain happiness in this life.{{sfn|Kingsland|2016|p=280}} In the contemporary [[Vipassana movement]] that emerged out of the Theravada Buddhism, freedom and the "pursuit of happiness" have become the main goals, not the end of rebirth, which is hardly mentioned in their teachings.{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|pp=164-166}}{{refn|group=note|The Vipassana-movement originated in colonial Burma, in response to the British colonial regime. While traditional Theravada saw little room for meditation practice, a subordinate role for lay Buddhists, and the attainment of ''nirvana'' as impossible in our times, reformists advocated the practice of meditation by lay Buddhists, as a means to preserve the pre-colonial order, which centered around Buddhism. ''Nirvana'' was suddenly deemed attainable, also for lay Buddhists. The Burmese reformists had a profound influence in the Theravada world, and also in the USA since the 1970s, shaping the popular understanding of Buddhism.&lt;ref group=web name="Braun2014"&gt;Eric Braun (2014), [http://www.spiritrock.org/document.doc?id=5335 ''How colonialism sparked the global Vipassana movement'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;See also David Chapman (2011), [https://vividness.live/2011/07/07/theravada-reinvents-meditation/ ''Theravada reinvents meditation''].}}

Yet, though freedom and happiness is a part of the Buddhist teachings, these words refer to something different in traditional Asian Buddhism. According to Fronsdal, "when Asian teachers do talk about freedom, it is primarily in reference to what one is free from—that is, from greed, hate, delusion, grasping, attachment, wrong view, self, and most significantly, rebirth".{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|p=172}} ''Nibbana'' is the final freedom, and it has no purpose beyond itself. In contrast, freedom in the creative modern interpretation of Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path means living happily and wisely, "without drastic changes in lifestyle".{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|p=172}} Such freedom and happiness is not the goal of Four Noble Truths and related doctrines within traditional Buddhism, but the vipassana teachings in the West make no reference to traditional Theravada doctrines, instead they present only the pragmatic and experiential goals in the form of therapy for the audience's current lives.{{sfn|Fronsdal|1998|pp=172-174}} The creative interpretations are driven in part because the foundational premises of Buddhism do not make sense to audiences outside of Asia.{{refn|group=note|Stephen Batchelor states, "Such craving is at the root of greed, hatred, and bewilderment that prompt one to commit acts that cause one to be reborn after death in more or less favourable conditions in samsara. Although I have presented this formulation of the existential dilemma and its resolution in Buddhist terms, the same soteriological framework is shared by Hindus and Jains. (...) So embedded is this Indian soteriological framework in Buddhism that Buddhists might find it unintelligible that one would even consider questioning it. For to dispense with such key doctrines as rebirth, the law of kamma, and liberation from the cycle of birth and death would surely undermine the entire edifice of Buddhism itself. Yet for those who have grown up outside of Indian culture, who feel at home in a modernity informed by the natural sciences, to then be told that one cannot “really” practise the dharma unless one adheres to the tenets of ancient Indian soteriology makes little sense. The reason people can no longer accept these beliefs need not be because they reject them as false, but because such views are too much at variance with everything else they know and believe about the nature of themselves and the world. They simply do not work anymore, and the intellectual gymnastics one needs to perform to make them work seem casuistic and, for many, unpersuasive. They are metaphysical beliefs, in that (like belief in God) they can neither be convincingly demonstrated nor refuted."{{sfn|Batchelor|2012|p=89-90}}}}{{refn|group=note|name="Wallace"|B. Alan Wallace states, "The Theravada Buddhist worldview is originally based on the Pali Buddhist canon, as interpreted by the great fifth-century commentator Buddhaghosa and later Buddhist scholars and contemplatives. For the immigrant Theravada Buddhist laity, the central feature of this worldview is the affirmation of the reality of reincarnation and karma. The possibility of achieving nirvana is primarily a concern for Buddhist monastics, while the laity are more concerned with avoiding karma that would propel them to a miserable rebirth, and with accumulating meritorious karma that will lead to a favorable rebirth and, in the long run, to ultimate liberation. (...) As a direct result of their belief in the efficacy of karma, Theravada lay Buddhists commonly make offerings of food, goods, and money to the ordained Sangha. Such meritorious conduct is thought to lead to a better rebirth either for themselves or for their deceased loved ones, depending on how the merit is dedicated by the person who performs this service."{{sfn|Wallace|2002|p=36–37}}}} According to Spiro, "the Buddhist message is not simply a psychological message," but an eschatological message.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=42}}

{{See also|Pre-sectarian Buddhism}}

According to Anderson, "the four truths are recognized as perhaps the most important teaching of the Buddha."{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55}} Yet, as early as 1935 [[Caroline Rhys Davids]] wrote that for a teaching so central to Theravada Buddhism, it was missing from critical passages in the Pali canon.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=ix}} According to Gethin, the four truths and the eightfold path are only two lists of "literally hundreds of similar lists covering the whole range of the theory and practice of ancient Buddhism."{{sfn|Gethin|2003|p=20}} The position of the four truths within the canon raises questions, and has been investigated throughout the 19th and 20th century.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=168-211}}

===Scholarly analysis of the oldest texts===
According to academic scholars, inconsistencies in the oldest texts may reveal developments in the oldest teachings.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=ix}}{{refn|group=note|name="development of teachings"}} While the Theravada-tradition holds that the Sutta Pitaka is "the definitive recension of the Buddha-word,"{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|1995a|p=13}} and Theravadins argue that it is likely that the sutras date back to the Buddha himself, in an unbroken chain of oral transmission,&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web | last1 =Payutto|first1=P.

Information of the oldest teachings of Buddhism, such as on the Four Noble Truths, has been obtained by analysis of the oldest texts and these inconsistencies, and are a matter of ongoing discussion and research.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997}}{{refn|group=note|According to Schmithausen, three positions held by scholars of Buddhism can be distinguished regarding the possibility to retain knowledge of the oldest Buddhism:{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=vii}}
# "Stress on the fundamental homogeneity and substantial authenticity of at least a considerable part of the Nikayic materials;"{{refn|group=subnote|Well-known proponents of the first position are:&lt;br&gt;* [[A.K. Warder]]. According to A.K. Warder, in his 1970 publication "Indian Buddhism", from the oldest extant texts a common kernel can be drawn out,{{sfn|Warder|1999|loc=inside flap}} namely the [[Bodhipakkhiyādhammā]]. According to Warder, c.q. his publisher: "This kernel of doctrine is presumably common Buddhism of the period before the great schisms of the fourth and third centuries BC. It may be substantially the Buddhism of the Buddha himself, although this cannot be proved: at any rate it is a Buddhism presupposed by the schools as existing about a hundred years after the parinirvana of the Buddha, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was formulated by anyone else than the Buddha and his immediate followers."{{sfn|Warder|1999|loc=inside flap}}&lt;br&gt;* [[Richard Gombrich]]: "I have the greatest difficulty in accepting that the main edifice is not the work of a single genius.

# "Scepticism with regard to the possibility of retrieving the doctrine of earliest Buddhism;"{{refn|group=subnote|A proponent of the second position is Ronald Davidson: "While most scholars agree that there was a rough body of sacred literature (disputed)(sic) that a relatively early community (disputed)(sic) maintained and transmitted, we have little confidence that much, if any, of surviving Buddhist scripture is actually the word of the historic Buddha."{{sfn|Davidson|2003|p=147}}}}
# "Cautious optimism in this respect."{{refn|group=subnote|Well-known proponent of the third position are:&lt;br&gt;* J.W. de Jong: "It would be hypocritical to assert that nothing can be said about the doctrine of earliest Buddhism [...] the basic ideas of Buddhism found in the canonical writings could very well have been proclaimed by him [the Buddha], transmitted and developed by his disciples and, finally, codified in fixed formulas."{{sfn|Jong|1993|p=25}}&lt;br&gt;* Johannes Bronkhorst: "This position is to be preferred to (ii) for purely methodological reasons: only those who seek may find, even if no success is guaranteed."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1997|p=vii}}&lt;br&gt;* Donald Lopez: "The original teachings of the historical Buddha are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to recover or reconstruct."{{sfn|Lopez|1995|p=4}}}}}}

===Development===

====Growing importance====
According to Bronkhorst, the four truths may already have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, but did not have the central place they acquired in later buddhism.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} According to Anderson, only by the time of the commentaries, in the fifth century CE, did the four truths come to be identified in the Theravada tradition as the central teaching of the Buddha.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55-56}}{{refn|group=note|Anderson: "However, the four noble truths do not always appear in stories of the Buddha's enlightenment where we might expect to find them. This feature may indicate that the four noble truths emerged into the canonical tradition at a particular point and slowly became recognized as the first teaching of the Buddha. Speculations about early and late teachings must be made relative to other passages in the Pali canon because of a lack of supporting extratextual evidence. Nonetheless, it is still possible to suggest a certain historical development of the four noble truths within the Pali canon. What we will find is a doctrine that came to be identified as the central teaching of the Buddha by the time of the commentaries in the fifth century C.E."{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=55-56}}}} According to Anderson,
{{quote|... the four noble truths were probably not part of the earliest strata of what came to be recognized as Buddhism, but that they emerged as a central teaching in a slightly later period that still preceded the final redactions of the various Buddhist canons.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=21}}}}

According to Feer and Anderson, the four truths probably entered the Sutta Pitaka from the Vinaya, the rules for monastic order.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=74, 77}}{{refn|group=note|Anderson refers to Léon Feer, who already in 1870 "suggested the possibility that the four noble truths emerged into Buddhist literature through ''vinaya'' collections."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=183}} She also refers to Bareau, who noticed the consistency between the two versions in the ''Mahavagga'', part of the ''Vinaya'', and the ''Dhammacakkappavattana-sutta'' of the Buddha's enlightenment: "As Bareau noted, the consistency between these two versions of the Buddha's enlightenment is an indication that the redactors of the Theravada canon probably brought the two accounts into agreement with each other at a relatively late point in the formation of the canon.&lt;br /&gt;Leon Feer had already suggested in 1870 that the versions of the four noble truths found in the sutras and suttas were derived from the vinaya rescensions in the larger body of Buddhist literature; Bareau's conclusion builds on this claim."{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=74}}}} They were first added to enlightenment-stories which contain the Four Jhanas, replacing terms for "liberating insight".{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=148}}{{refn|group=note|According to Schmithausen, in his often-cited article ''On some Aspects of Descriptions or Theories of 'Liberating Insight' and 'Enlightenment' in Early Buddhism'', the mention of the four noble truths as constituting "liberating insight", which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas, is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36.{{sfn|Schmithausen|1981}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}}} From there they were added to the biographical stories of the Buddha.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=17}}{{refn|group=note|Anderson refers to research by K.R.

====Substituting "liberating insight"====
Scholars have noted inconsistencies in the presentations of the Buddha's enlightenment, and the Buddhist path to liberation, in the oldest sutras. They offer that these inconsistencies show that the Buddhist teachings evolved, either during the lifetime of the Buddha, or thereafter.&lt;!--**START OF NOTE**--&gt;{{refn|group=note|name="development of teachings"|See:

Instead, they are a rather late theory on the content of the Buddha's enlightenment.{{sfn|Hirakawa|1990|p=28}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, the earliest Buddhist path consisted of a set of practices which culminate in the practice of ''dhyana'',{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}} leading to a calm of mind and [[Sati (Buddhism)|awareness]] (mindfulness){{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=XXV}} which according to Vetter ''is'' the liberation which is being sought.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{refn|group=note|Note that ''dhyana'' is not the same as ''samatha'', the calming of the mind by one-pointedly concentration. While ''dhyana'' also leads to a calm of mind, it aids in developing mindfulness, which is necessary to be aware of the arising of disturbing, selfish, thoughts and emotions, and to counter them. Wynne: "...the Buddha taught a ‘middle way’ between pure meditation and cognitive practices. The states of absorption induced by meditation were considered useful and necessary, but in distinction from the meditative mainstream their ultimate aim was insight. For the Buddha it was vitally important that the meditative adept should apply his concentrative state to the practice of mindfulness (Sn 1070: ''satima''; Sn 1111: ''ajjhattañ ca bahiddha ca nabhinandato''; Sn 1113: ''ajjhattañ ca bahiddha ca natthi ti passato''), and work towards the attainment of insight. According to this view meditation alone, the goal of the meditative mainstream would have been harshly criticized in the earliest Buddhism."{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=105}}}} Later on, "liberating insight" came to be regarded as equally liberating.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=99-102}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}} This "liberating insight" came to be exemplified by ''prajna'', or the insight in the "four truths,"{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=99-102}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}} but also by other elements of the Buddhist teachings.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=chpter 7}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, this growing importance of "liberating insight" was a response to other religious groups in India, which held that a liberating insight was indispensable for ''[[moksha]]'', liberation from rebirth.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxii, xxxiii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=54-55, 96, 99}}{{refn|group=note|Tillmann Vetter: "Very likely the cause was the growing influence of a non-Buddhist spiritual environment·which claimed that one can be released only by some truth or higher knowledge. In addition the alternative (and perhaps sometimes competing) method of discriminating insight (fully established after the introduction of the four noble truths) seemed to conform so well to this claim."{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiii}}&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Bronkhorst, this happened under influence of the "mainstream of meditation," that is, Vedic-Brahmanical oriented groups, which believed that the cessation of action could not be liberating, since action can never be fully stopped. Their solution was to postulate a fundamental difference between the inner soul or self and the body. The inner self is unchangeable, and unaffected by actions. By insight into this difference, one was liberated. To equal this emphasis on insight, Buddhists presented insight into their most essential teaching as equally liberating. What exactly was regarded as the central insight "varied along with what was considered most central to the teaching of the Buddha."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=54-55, 96, 99}}}} This change is reflected in the canon, where, according to Bronkhorst,
{{quote|...the accounts which include the Four Noble Truths had a completely different conception of the process of liberation than the one which includes the Four Dhyanas and the destruction of the intoxicants.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}}}

According to Vetter and Bonkhorst, the ideas on what exactly constituted this "liberating insight" was not fixed but developed over time.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=chpter 7}} According to Bronkhorst, in [[Presectarian Buddhism|earliest Buddhism]] the four truths did not serve as a description of "liberating insight".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} Initially the term ''prajna'' served to denote this "liberating insight." Later on, ''prajna'' was replaced in the suttas by the "four truths."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99-100, 102-111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} This happened in those texts where practicing the four jhanas preceded the attainment of "liberating insight," and where this practice of the four jhanas then culminates in "liberating insight."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}} This "liberating insight" came to be defined as "insight into the four truths," which is presented as the "liberating insight" which constituted the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], or "enlightenment" of the Buddha. When he understood these truths he was "enlightened" and liberated,{{refn|group=note|"Enlightenment" is a typical western term, which bears its own, specific western connotations, meanings and interpretations.{{sfn|Cohen|2006}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}}} as reflected in Majjhima Nikaya 26:42: "his taints are destroyed by his seeing with wisdom."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=268}}

Bronkhorst points to an inconsistency, noting that the four truths refer here to the eightfold path as the means to gain liberation, while the attainment of insight into the four truths is portrayed as liberating in itself.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} According to Bronkhorst, this is an inconsistency which reveals a change which took place over time in the composition of the sutras.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} An example of this substitution, and its consequences, is Majjhima Nikaya 36:42-43, which gives an account of the awakening of the Buddha.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=102-103}}

According to Schmithausen, the four truths were superseded by ''[[pratityasamutpada]]'', and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the [[Anatta|non-existence of a substantial self or person]].{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=100-101}}. Schmithausen further states that still other descriptions of this "liberating insight" exist in the Buddhist canon:
{{quote|"that the five Skandhas are impermanent, disagreeable, and neither the Self nor belonging to oneself";{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 26}} "the contemplation of the arising and disappearance (''udayabbaya'') of the five Skandhas";{{refn|group=note|Anguttara Nikaya II.45 (PTS)}} "the realisation of the Skandhas as empty (''rittaka''), vain (''tucchaka'') and without any pith or substance (''asaraka'').{{refn|group=note|Samyutta Nikaya III.140-142 (PTS)}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=101}}}}

In contrast, Thanissaro Bikkhu presents the view that the four truths, [[pratityasamutpada]] and anatta are inextricably intertwined &lt;ref&gt;Wings to Awakening Part 3, https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part3.html#part3-h-1&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Acquiring the ''dhamma-eye'' and destroying the ''āsavās''===
In their symbolic function, the sutras present the insight into the four truths as the culmination of the Buddh's path to awakening. In the ''Vinayapitaka'' and the ''Sutta-pitaka'' they have the same symbolic function, in a reenactment by his listeners of the Buddha's awakening by attaining the ''dhamma-eye''. In contrast, here this insight serves as the starting point to path-entry for his audience.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=126, 132, 143}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2000|p=79, 80}} These sutras present a repeated sequence of events:{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=132-134}}
# ''Annupubbikathā'' ("graduated talk"), in which the Buddha explains the four truths; this talk frees the listener from the hindrances;
# This talk opens the ''dhammacakkhu'' ("dhamma eye"), and knowledge arises: "all that has the nature of arising has the nature of ending";{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=132}}{{refn|group=note|In effect to the exposition of the four truths, as presented in the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', the "dustless, stainless Dhamma eye" arose to Kondañña, stating: "Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation."&lt;ref group=web name="Dhammacakka"/&gt;}}
# The request to become a member of the Buddhist order;
# A second talk by the Buddha, which destroys the ''āsavās'', impurities;
# The statement that "there are now ''x arahats'' in the world."

Yet, in other sutras, where the four truths have a propositional function, the comprehension of the four truths destroys the corruptions.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=146}} They do so in combination with the practice of the ''jhanas'' and the attainment of the divine eye, with which past lives and the working of rebirth are being seen.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=146-147}}

According to Anderson, following Schmithausen and Bronkhorst, these two presentations give two different models of the path to liberation, reflecting their function as a symbol and as a proposition.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=149}} Most likely, the four truths were first associated with the culmination of the path in the destruction of the ''āsavās'', where they substituted the unspecified "liberating insight"; as the canon developed, they became more logically associated with the beginning of the Buddhist path.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=149}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2000|p=79, 80}}

===Popularisation in the west===
According to Anderson there is a strong tendency within scholarship to present the four truths as the most essential teaching of Buddhism.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=196}} According to Anderson, the four truths have been simplified and popularized in western writings, due to "the colonial project of gaining control over Buddhism."{{sfn|Crosby|2013}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=197}} According to Crosby, the Buddhist teachings are reduced to a "simple, single rationalized account," which has parallels in the reinterpretation of the Buddha in western literature.{{sfn|Crosby|2013}}

The presentation of the four truths as one of the most important teachings of the Buddha "has been [done] to reduce the four noble truths to a teaching that is accessible, pliable, and therefore readily appropriated by non-Buddhists."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=197}} There is a great variety of teachings in the Buddhist literature, which may be bewildering for those who are unaware of this variety.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=196}} The four truths are easily accessible in this regard, and are "readily [understood] by those outside the Buddhist traditions."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=196-197}} For example Walpola Rahula's ''What the Buddha Taught'', a widely used introductory text for non-Buddhists, uses the four truths as a framework to present an overview of the Buddhist teachings.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=197}}

According to Harris, the British in the 19th century crafted new representations of Buddhism and the Buddha.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=169}} 19th century missionaries studied Buddhism, to be more effective in their missionary efforts.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=120}} The Buddha was de-mystified, and reduced from a "superhuman" to a "compassionate, heroic human," serving "western historical method and the missionary agenda of situating the Buddha firmly below the divine."{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=169}} The four truths were discovered by the British by reading the Buddhist texts, and were not immediately granted the central position they later received.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=169}}

The writings of British missionaries show a growing emphasis on the four truths as being central to Buddhism, with somewhat different presentations of them.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=72-73}}{{refn|group=note| Whereas Gogerly wrote in 1861 "That sorrow is connected with existence in all its forms [and] [t]hat its continuance results from a continued desire of existence," Spencer Hardy wrote in 1866 that "there is sorrow connected with every mode of existence; that the cause of sorrow is desire."{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=72-73}} Childers, drawing on Gogerly and Hardy, writes that "existence is suffering; human passion (''tanhã'' - desire) is the cause of continued existence."{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=120}}}} This colonial project had a strong influence on some strands of Buddhism, culminating in socalled [[Protestant Buddhism]], which incorporated several essentially Protestant attitudes regarding religion, such as the emphasis on written texts.{{sfn|Gombrich|Obeyesekere|1988}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{refn|group=note|See David Chapman, [https://vividness.live/2011/06/24/protestant-buddhism/ ''Protestant Buddhism''], [https://vividness.live/2011/06/28/a-new-world-religion/ ''A new World Religion''] and [https://vividness.live/2011/06/24/problems-with-scripture/ ''Problems with scripture''].}} According to Gimello, Rahula's book is an example of this Protestant Budhism, and "was created in an accommodating response to western expectations, and in nearly diametrical opposition to Buddhism as it had actually been practised in traditional Theravada."{{refn|group=note|Gimello (2004), as quoted in Taylor (2007).{{sfn|Taylor|2007|p=361}}}}

[[Hendrik Kern]] proposed in 1882 that the model of the four truths may be an analogy with classical Indian medicine, in which the four truths function as a medical diagnosis, and the Buddha is presented as a physician.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=189}}{{refn|group=note|Kern's model:{{sfn|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Locations 909-911}}{{sfn|Lopez|2001|p=52}}{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=42}}
# ''The truth of dukkha:'' identifying the illness and the nature of the illness (the [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]])
# ''The truth of origin:''  identifying the [[Cause (medicine)|causes of the illness]]
# ''The truth of cessation:'' identifying a cure for the illness (the [[prognosis]])
# ''The truth of the path:'' recommending a treatment for the illness that can bring about a cure (the [[Medical prescription|prescription]])}} Kern's analogy became rather popular,{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=189}}{{refn|group=note|See,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Keown|2000|loc=Kindle Locations 909-911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lopez|2001|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Williams|2002|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} but "there is not sufficient historical evidence to conclude that the Buddha deliberately drew upon a clearly defined medical model for his fourfold analysis of human pain."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=189}}

According to Anderson, those scholars who did not place the four truths at the center of Buddhism, either "located the four truths in a fuller reading of the Theravada canon and the larger context of South Asian literature," or "located the teaching within an experience of Buddhism as practiced in a contemporary setting."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=198}} According to Anderson, "these autors suggest a more complex reading of the four noble truths than those who locate the teaching as the key to or as a crucial element within the grand scheme of Buddhism."{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=198}}

==Appearance within the discourses==
The developing Buddhist tradition inserted the four truths, using various formulations, at various sutras.{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} They are being used both as a symbol of all dhammas and the Buddha's awakening, and as a set of propositions which function within a matrix of teachings.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=86}} According to Anderson, there is no single way to understand the teachings; one teaching may be used to explain another teaching, and vice versa. The teachings form a network, which should be apprehended as such to understand how the various teachings intersect with each other.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=86-87}}

===Symbolic function===

====''Mahasaccaka Sutta''====
The ''Mahasaccaka Sutta'' ("The Greater Discourse to Saccaka", Majjhima Nikaya 36) gives one of several versions of the Buddha's way to liberation.{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 26, "The Noble Search," also gives an account, which is markedly different, omitting the ascetic practices and the four truths.}} He attains the three knowledges, namely knowledge of his former lifes, knowledge of death and rebirth, and knowledge of the destruction of the taints,{{refn|group=note|Which keep one trapped in ''samsara''.}} the Four Noble Truths.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995}} After going through the four dhyanas, and gaining the first two knowledges, the story proceeds:
{{quote|I directed my mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the intoxicants [suffering ... origin ... cessation ... path] [intoxicants (''asava'') ... origin ... cessation ... path] My mind was liberated [...] the knowledge arose that it was liberated.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=102-103}}}}

Bronkhorst dismisses the first two knowledges as later additions, and proceeds to notice that the recognition of the intoxicants is modelled on the four truths. According to Bronkhorst, those are added the bridge the original sequence of "I directed my mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the intoxicants. My mind was liberated", which was interrupted by the addition of the four truths. Bronkhorst points out that those do not fit here, since the four truths culminate in the knowledge of the path to be followed, while the Buddha himself is already liberated at that point.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=103-104}}

====''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta''====
[[File:Gandharan - Expounding the Law - Walters 2551.jpg|right|thumb|A relief depicting the first discourse of the Buddha, from the 2nd century (Kushan).&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://art.thewalters.org/detail/21971 Expounding the Law], [[The Walters Art Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum. The Buddha's hand can be seen at right.]]

According to the Buddhist tradition, the first talk of [[Gautama Buddha]] after he attained [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] is recorded in the ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]'' ("Setting in Motion the Wheel of Dhamma", Samyutta Nikaya 56.11). The ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' provides details on three stages in the understanding of each truth, for a total of twelve insights. The three stages for understanding each truth are:{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle loc. 3935-3939}}{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|pp=99-100}}{{sfn|Ajahn Sumedho|2002|loc=p. 9}}{{sfn|Moffitt|2002|loc=Kindle loc. 225-226}}{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 303-306}}
# ''sacca-ñāṇa'' - knowing the nature of the truth (e.g., acknowledgement, view, reflection)
# ''kicca-ñāṇa'' - knowing what needs to be done in connection with that truth (e.g., practice; motivation; directly experiencing)
# ''kata-ñāṇa'' - accomplishing what needs to be done (e.g., result, full understanding, knowing)

These three stages of understanding are emphasized particularly in the Theravada tradition, but they are also recognized by some contemporary Mahayana teachers.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 303-306}}{{sfn|Thich Nhat Hahn|1999|pp=28-46}}

According to Cousins, many scholars are of the view that "this discourse was identified as the first sermon of the Buddha only at a later date."{{sfn|Cousins|2002|p=3}} According to Stephen Batchelor, the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' contains incongruities, and states that
{{quote|The First Discourse cannot be treated as a verbatim transcript of what the Buddha taught in the Deer Park, but as a document that has evolved over an unspecified period of time until it reached the form in which it is found today in the canons of the different Buddhist schools.{{sfn|Batchelor|2012|p=91}}}}

According to Bronkhorst this "first sermon" is recorded in several sutras, with important variations.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}} In the Vinaya texts, and in the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' which was influenced by the Vinaya texts, the four truths are included, and Kondañña is enlightened{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=69}} when the "vision of Dhamma"{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2000|p=1846}} arises in him: "whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation."{{refn|group=note|Translation Bhikkhu Bodhi (2000), ''Samyutta Nikaya'', SN 56.11, p.1846. See also Anderson (2001), ''Pain and its Ending'', p.69.}} Yet, in the ''Ariyapariyesanā Sutta'' ("The Noble Search", Majjhima Nikaya 26) the four truths are not included,{{refn|group=note|MN 26.17 merely says "[']This will serve for the striving of a clansman intent on striving.' And I sat down there thinking: 'This will serve for striving.'{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=259}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi Majjhima Nikaya 36 then continuous with the extreme ascetic practices, which are omitted in MN 26.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=1216, note 403}} In verse 18, the Buddha has attained Nirvana, being secured from bondage by birth, ageing, sickness and death, referring to the truths of dependent origination and "the stilling of all formations, the relinquishing of all attachments, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=259-260}}}} and the Buddha gives the five ascetics personal instructions in turn, two or three of them, while the others go out begging for food. The versions of the "first sermon" which include the four truths, such as the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', omit this instruction, showing that
{{quote|...the accounts which include the Four Noble Truths had a completely different conception of the process of liberation than the one which includes the Four Dhyanas and the subsequent destruction of the intoxicants.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}}}

According to Bronkhorst, this indicates that the four truths were later added to earlier descriptions of liberation by practicing the four dhyanas, which originally was thought to be sufficient for the destruction of the arsavas.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}} Anderson, following Norman, also thinks that the four truths originally were not part of this sutta, and were later added in some versions.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=68}}{{refn|group=note|According to Cousins, Anderson misunderstands Norman in this respect, but does "not think that this misunderstanding of Norman's position critically affects Anderson's thesis. Even if these arguments do not prove that the four truths are definitely a later insertion in the Dhammacakkapavattana-sutta, it is certainly possible to take the position that the sutta itself is relatively late."{{sfn|Cousins|2002|p=3}}}}

According to Bronkhorst, the "twelve insights" are probably also a later addition, born out of unease with the substitution of the general term "prajna" for the more specific "four truths".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=106}}

====''Maha-parinibbana Sutta''====
According to the Buddhist tradition, the ''[[Maha-parinibbana Sutta]]'' (Last Days of the Buddha, Digha Nikaya 16) was given near the end of the Buddha's life. This sutta "gives a good general idea of the Buddha's Teaching:"&lt;ref group=web name="ati_Maha-parinibbana_Sutta"&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html ''Maha-parinibbana Sutta: Last Days of the Buddha'', translated by Sister Vajira &amp; Francis Story]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|And the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, saying: "Bhikkhus, it is through not realizing, through not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that this long course of birth and death has been passed through and undergone by me as well as by you. What are these four? They are the noble truth of suffering; the noble truth of the origin of suffering; the noble truth of the cessation of suffering; and the noble truth of the way to the cessation of suffering. But now, bhikkhus, that these have been realized and penetrated, cut off is the craving for existence, destroyed is that which leads to renewed becoming, and there is no fresh becoming."

Thus it was said by the Blessed One. And the Happy One, the Master, further said:
:Through not seeing the Four Noble Truths,
:Long was the weary path from birth to birth.
:When these are known, removed is rebirth's cause,
:The root of sorrow plucked; then ends rebirth.}}

===Propositional function===

====''Maha-salayatanika Sutta''====
The ''Maha-salayatanika Sutta'', Majjhima Nikaya 149:3 plus 149:9, give an alternative presentation of the four truths:
{{quote|When one abides inflamed by lust, fettered, infatuated, contemplating gratification, [...] [o]ne's bodily and mental troubles increase, one's bodily and mental torments increase, one's bodily and mental fevers increase, and one experiences bodily and mental suffering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...when one does not know and see as it actually is [the feeling] felt as pleasant or painful or neither painful-nor-pleasant that arises with eye-contact as condition, then one is inflamed by lust for the eye, for forms, for eye-consciousness, for eye-contact, for [the feeling] felt as pleasant or painful or neither painful-nor-pleasant that arises with eye-contact as condition [repeated for the nose, tongue, body, mind].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When one abides uninflamed by lust, unfettered, uninfatuated, contemplating danger [...] one's craving [...] is abandoned. One's bodily and mental troubles are abandoned, one's bodily and mental torments are abandoned, one's bodily and mental fevers are abandoned, and one experiences bodily and mental pleasure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...when one knows and see as it actually is [the feeling] felt as pleasant or painful or neither painful-nor-pleasant that arises with eye-contact as condition, then one is not inflamed by lust for the eye, for forms, for eye-consciousness, for eye-contact, for [the feeling] felt as pleasant or painful or neither painful-nor-pleasant that arises with eye-contact as condition [repeated for the nose, tongue, body, mind].{{sfn|Bhikkhu Nanamoli (translator)|1995|p=1137}}}}

==Emphasis within different traditions==

===Early Indian Buddhism===
The [[Ekavyāvahārika]] sect emphasized the transcendence of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], asserting that he was eternally enlightened and essentially non-physical. According to the Ekavyāvahārika, the words of the Buddha were spoken with one transcendent meaning, and the Four Noble Truths are to be understood simultaneously in one moment of insight.{{sfn|Rockhill |1884|pp=187-188}} According to the [[Mahīśāsaka]] sect, the Four Noble Truths should be meditated upon simultaneously.{{sfn|Potter|2004|p=106}}

===Theravada===
{{See also|Vipassana movement}}

According to Carol Anderson, the four truths have "a singular position within the Theravada canon and tradition."{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=230-231}} The Theravada tradition regards insight in the four truths as liberating in itself.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179}} As Walpola Rahula states, "when the Truth is seen, all the forces which feverishly produce the continuity of [[samsara]] in [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|illusion]] become calm and incapable of producing any more [[Karma in Buddhism|karma-formations]] [...] he is free from [...] the 'thirst' for becoming."&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Walpola Rahula:
* "When wisdom is developed and cultivated according to the Fourth Noble Truth (the next to be taken up), it sees the secret of life, the reality of things as they are. When the secret is discovered, when the Truth is seen, all the forces which feverishly produce the continuity of saṃsāra in illusion become calm and incapable of producing any more karma-formations, because there is no more illusion, no more ‘thirst’ for continuity."&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt; 
* "The remaining two factors, namely Right Thought and Right Understanding go to constitute Wisdom."&lt;ref group=web name="WP_ch5"&gt;Walpola Rahula, [https://sites.google.com/site/rahulawhatthebuddha/the-fourth-noble-truth Chapert 5. ''Magga'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Right Understanding is the understanding of things as they are, and it is the Four Noble Truths that explain things as they really are. Right Understanding therefore is ultimately reduced to the understanding of the Four Noble Truths. This understanding is the highest wisdom which sees the Ultimate Reality."&lt;ref group=web name="WP_ch5"/&gt;}} This liberation can be attained in one single moment, when the four truths are understood together.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179}} Within the [[Theravada]] tradition, great emphasis is placed upon reading and contemplating ''[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|The Discourse That Sets Turning the Wheel of Truth]]'', and other suttas, as a means to study the four noble truths and put them into practice.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 275-280}} For example, Ajahn Sumedho states: 
{{quote|The ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'', the Buddha's teaching on the Four Noble Truths, has been the main reference that I have used for my practice over the years. It is the teaching we used in our monastery in Thailand. The Theravada school of Buddhism regards this sutta as the quintessence of the teachings of the Buddha. This one sutta contains all that is necessary for understanding the Dhamma and for enlightenment."{{sfn|Ajahn Sumedho| 2002|p=5}}}}

Within the Theravada-tradition, three different stances on ''[[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]]'' and the question what happens with the ''Arhat'' after death can be found.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=77}}{{sfn|Hick|1994|p=436}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|[96-97}}{{sfn|Geisler|Amano|2004|p=32}} ''Nirvana'' refers to the cessation of the defilements and the resulting peace of mind and happiness (''khlesa-nirvana''); to the final dissolution of the five skandhas at the time of death (''skandha-nirvana'' or ''[[parinirvana]]''); and to a transcendental reality which is "known at the moment of awakening."{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=77}}{{refn|group=note|Gethin: "(I) it is the extinguishing of the defilements of greed, hatred, and delusion; (2) it is the final condition of the Buddha and arhats after death consequent upon the extinction of the defilements; (3) it is the unconditioned realm known at the moment of awakening.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=77}}}} According to Gethin, "modern Buddhist usage tends to restrict 'nirvāṇa' to the awakening experience and reserve 'parinirvāṇa' for the death experience.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=76}} According to Geisler and Amano, in the "minimal Theravada interpretation", ''nirvana'' is a psychological state, which ends with the dissolution of the body and the total extinction of existence.{{sfn|Hick|1994|p=436}}{{sfn|Geisler|Amano|2004|p=32}} According to Geisler and Amano, the "orthodox Theravada interpretation" is that nirvana is a transcendent reality with which the self unites.{{sfn|Geisler|Amano|2004|p=32}} According to Bronkhorst, while "Buddhism preached liberation in this life, i.e. before death,"{{sfn|Bronkhorst|p=96}} there was also a tendency in Buddhism to think of liberation happening after death. According to Bronkhorst, this 
{{quote|...becomes visible in those canonical passages which distinguish between Nirvana - qualified in Sanskrit and pali as 'without a remainder of upadhi/upadi (anupadhisesa/anupadisesa) - and the 'highest and complete enlightenment'(anuttara samyaksambodhi/sammasambodhi). The former occurs at death, the latter in life.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=97}}}}

According to [[Walpola Rahula]], the cessation of ''dukkha'' is ''nirvana'', the ''summum bonum'' of Buddhism, and is attained in this life, not when one dies.&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt; ''Nirvana'' is "perfect freedom, peace, tranquility and happiness,"&lt;ref group=web&gt;Walpola Rahula, [https://sites.google.com/site/rahulawhatthebuddha/the-first-noble-truth ''What the Buddha Taught. Chapter 2. Dukkha'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt; and "Absolute Truth," which simply ''is''.&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught'', [https://sites.google.com/site/rahulawhatthebuddha/the-third-noble-truth chapter four: Nirodha]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- **START OF NOTE** --&gt;{{refn|group=note|According to Rahula, in ''[[What the Buddha Taught]]'',
{{quote|... if Nirvāṇa is to be expressed and explained in positive terms, we are likely immediately to grasp an idea associated with those terms, which may be quite the contrary. Therefore it is generally expressed in negative terms."&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt;{{refn|group=subnote|According to Gombrich this distinction between [[Apophatic theology|apophatic]] and cataphatic approaches can be found in all religions.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=150-152}}}}}} Rahula gives an overview of negative statements of ''nirvana,'' whereafter he states:
{{quote|Because Nirvana is thus expressed in negative terms, there are many who have got a wrong notion that it is negative, and expresses self-annihilation. Nirvāṇa is definitely no annihilation of self, because there is no self to annihilate. If at all, it is the annihilation of the illusion of the false idea of self.&lt;br&gt;
It is incorrect to say that Nirvāṇa is negative or positive. The ideas of ‘negative’ and ‘positive’ are relative, and are within the realm of duality. These terms cannot be applied to Nirvāṇa, Absolute Truth, which is beyond duality and relativity [...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Nirvāṇa is neither cause nor effect. It is beyond cause and effect. Truth is not a result nor an effect. It is not produced like a mystic, spiritual, mental state, such as dhyāna or samādhi. TRUTH IS. NIRVĀṆA IS.&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt;}}

Rahula refers to the ''Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta'' (the Majjhima-nikāya 140) for his interpretation of "Nirvāṇa as Absolute Truth," which, according to Rahula, says: 
{{quote|O bhikkhu, that which is unreality (mosadhamma) is false; that which is reality (amosadhamma), Nibbāna, is Truth (Sacca). Therefore, O bhikkhu, a person so endowed is endowed with this Absolute Truth. For, the Absolute Noble Truth (paramaṃ ariyasaccaṃ) is Nibbāna, which is Reality.’&lt;ref group=web name ="WP_ch4"/&gt;}}

While Jayatilleke translates ''amosadhamma'' as "ineffable,"{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2009|p=306}} Thanissaro Bhikkhu gives a somewhat different translation:
{{quote|His release, being founded on truth, does not fluctuate, for whatever is deceptive is false; Unbinding — the undeceptive — is true. Thus a monk so endowed is endowed with the highest determination for truth, for this — Unbinding, the undeceptive — is the highest noble truth.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.140.than.html ''Dhatu-vibhanga Sutta: An Analysis of the Properties'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response to Rahula, [[Richard Gombrich]] states that:
{{quote|In proclaiming (in block capitals) that 'Truth is', Rahula has for a moment fallen into Upanisadic mode. Since truth can only be a property of propositions, which have subjects and predicates, and nirvana is not a proposition, it makes no sense in English to say that nirvana is truth. The confusion arises, perhaps, because the Sanskrit word satyam and the corresponding Pali word saccam can indeed mean either 'truth' or 'reality'. But in our language this will not work.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=156-157}}}}

Richard Gombrich also states that Rahula's book would more aptly be titled ''What [[Buddhagosa]] Taught''.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=156-157}}  According to David Kalupahana, Buddhagosa was influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, and introduced "the substantialist as well as essentialist standpoints of the Sarvastavadins and Sautrantikas."{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=208, 210}}}}&lt;!-- **END OF NOTE** --&gt; Jayatilleke also speaks of "the attainment of an ultimate reality."{{sfn|Jayatilleke|2009|p=306}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, the "elimination of craving culminates not only in the extinction of sorrow, anguish and distress, but in the unconditioned freedom of nibbana, which is won with the ending of reapeated rebirth."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2011|p=10}}

According to Spiro, most (lay) Theravada Buddhists do not aspire for ''nirvana'' and total extinction, but for a pleasurable rebirth in heaven.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=76-77}} According to Spiro, this presents a "serious conflict" since the Buddhist texts and teaching "describe life as suffering and hold up nirvana as the ''summum bonum.''"{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=78}} In response to this deviation, "monks and others emphasize that the hope for nirvana is the only legitimate action for Buddhist action."{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=78}} Nevertheless, according to Spiro most Burmese lay Buddhists do not aspire for the extinction of existence which is ''nirvana''.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=78}}{{refn|group=note|name="Wallace"}}

According to [[B.R. Ambedkar]], the Indian Buddhist [[Dalit]] leader, the four truths were not part of the original teachings of the Buddha, but a later aggregation, due to Hindu influences.{{sfn|Karunyakara|2002|p=67}} According to Ambedkar, total cessation of suffering is an illusion; yet, the Buddhist Middle Path aims at the reduction of suffering and the maximizing of happiness, balancing both sorrow and happiness.{{sfn|Karunyakara|2002|p=67-68}}

===Mahayana===
The four truths are less prominent in the Mahayana traditions, which emphasize insight into [[Śūnyatā]] and the [[bodhisattva|Bodhisattva path]] as a central elements in their teachings.{{sfn|Carter|1987|p=3179-3180}} If the sutras in general are studied at all, it is through various Mahayana commentaries.{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=103}}

According to Makransky the Mahayana Bodhisattva ideal created tensions in the explanation of the four truths.{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=345}} In the Mahayana view, a fully enlightened Buddha does not leave ''samsara'', but remains in the world out of compassion for all sentient beings.{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346}} The four truths, which aim at ending ''samsara'', do not provide a doctrinal basis for this view, and had to be reinterpreted.{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346}} In the old view, ''[[Kleshas (Buddhism)|klesas]]'' and ''karma'' are the cause of prolonged existence. According to Makransky, "[t]o remove those causes was, at physical death, to extinguish one's conditioned existence, hence to end forever one's participation in the world (Third Truth)."{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346}} According to Makransky, the question of how a liberated being can still be "pervasively operative in this world" has been "a seminal source of ongoing doctrinal tension over Buddhahood throughout the history of the Mahayana in India and Tibet."{{sfn|Makransky|1997|p=346-347}}

====Tibetan Buddhism====
[[Atisha]], in his ''[[Bodhipathapradīpa]]'' ("A Lamp for the Path to Awakening"), which forms the basis for the [[Lamrim]] tradition, discerns three levels of motivation for Buddhist practitioners.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=17}} At the beginning level of motivation, one strives toward a better life in ''samsara''.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=17}} At the intermediate level, one strives to a liberation from existence in samsara and the end of all suffering.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=17, 66-67}} At the highest level of motivation, one strives after the liberation  of all living beings.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=17}} In his commentary on the text, Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche explains that the four truths are to be meditated upon as a means of practice for the intermediate level.{{sfn|Tsenshap Serkong Rinpoche|1996|p=66-67}}

According to [[Tashi Tsering (Jamyang Buddhist Centre)|Geshe Tashi Tsering]], within [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the four noble truths are studied as part of the Bodhisattva path. They are explained in Mahayana commentaries such as the ''[[Abhisamayalamkara]]'', a summary of and commentary on the [[Prajna Paramitra]] sutras, where they form part of the lower [[Hinayana]] teachings. The truth of the path (the fourth truth) is traditionally presented according to a progressive formula of [[Five Paths|five paths]], rather than as the eightfold path presented in Theravada.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 2187-2190}} According to Tsering, the study of the four truths is combined with the study of the [[sixteen characteristics]] of the four noble truths.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 741-743}}

Some contemporary Tibetan Buddhist teachers have provided commentary on the ''Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta'' and the noble eightfold path when presenting the dharma to Western students.{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 241}}{{sfn|Ringu Tulku|2005|pp=36-54}}{{sfn|Lama Surya Das|1997}}

====Nichiren Buddhism====
[[Nichiren Buddhism]] is based on the teaching of the Japanese priest and teacher [[Nichiren]], who believed that the [[Lotus Sūtra]] contained the essence of all of Gautama Buddha's teachings.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nichiren-shu.org.uk/septoctnewsletter.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031180446/http://www.nichiren-shu.org.uk/septoctnewsletter.html |archive-date=31 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The third chapter of the Lotus Sutra states that the Four Noble Truths was the early teaching of the Buddha, while the Dharma of the Lotus is the "most wonderful, unsurpassed great Dharma."&lt;ref group=web &gt;[http://www.sokahumanism.com/nichiren-buddhism/Four_Noble_Truths_and_the_Lotus_Sutra.html Quote from Watson (1993), The Lotus Sutra]&lt;/ref&gt; The teachings on the four noble truths are a provisional teaching, which Shakyamuni Buddha taught according to the people’s capacity, while the Lotus Sutra is a direct statement of Shakyamuni’s own enlightenment.&lt;ref group=web name=nletter2&gt;[http://www.sgilibrary.org/view.php?page=1039&amp;m=3&amp;q=four%20noble%20truths%20for%20voice-hearers Four Noble truths for Voice Hearers], see "Background" section&lt;/ref&gt;

For many western Buddhists, the rebirth doctrine in the Four Noble Truths teaching is a problematic notion.{{sfn|Konik|2009|p=ix}}{{sfn|Hayes|2013|p=172}}{{sfn|Lamb|2001|p=258}}&lt;ref group=web name="BB-rebirth"&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bps-essay_46.html ''Does Rebirth Make Sense?'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See also:&lt;br&gt;* [[James Ishmael Ford|James Ford]], [http://www.patheos.com/blogs/monkeymind/2015/08/the-karma-and-rebirth-debate-within-contemporary-western-buddhism-some-links-to-follow.html ''The Karma and Rebirth Debate Within Contemporary Western Buddhism: Some Links to Follow'']&lt;br&gt;* Manon Welles, [http://aristocratsofthesoul.com/secular-buddhism-vs-traditional-buddhism-six-key-differences/ ''Secular Buddhism vs. Traditional Buddhism: 6 Key Differences'']&lt;br&gt;* Alan Peta, [http://www.alanpeto.com/buddhism/understanding-reincarnation-rebirth/ ''Reincarnation and Buddhism: Here We Go Again'']&lt;br&gt;* David Chapman, [https://vividness.live/2011/06/16/the-making-of-buddhist-modernism/ ''The Making of Buddhist Modernism'']}} According to Lamb, "Certain forms of modern western Buddhism [...] see it as purely mythical and thus a dispensable notion."{{sfn|Lamb|2001|p=258}} According to Coleman, the focus of most vipassana students in the west "is mainly on meditation practice and a kind of down-to-earth psychological wisdom."{{sfn|Coleman|2002|p=110}}{{refn|group=note|According to Coleman, the goal in Theravada Buddhism "is to uproot the desires and defilements in order to attain nibbana (nirvana in Sanskrit) and win liberation from the otherwise endless round of death and rebirth. But few Western Vipassana teachers pay much attention to the more metaphysical aspects of such concepts as rebirth and nibbana, and of course very few of their students are celibate monks. Their focus is mainly on meditation practice and a kind of down-to-earth psychological wisdom. "As a result," one respected Vipassana teacher writes, "many more Americans of European descent refer to themselves as Vipassana students rather than as students of Theravada Buddhism."{{sfn|Coleman|2002|p=110}}}} According to [[Damien Keown]], westerners find "the ideas of [[karma]] and rebirth puzzling."{{sfn|Keown|2009|p=60–63, 74-85, 185-187}} According to Gowans, many Western followers and people interested in exploring Buddhism are skeptical and object to the belief in karma and rebirth foundational to the Four Noble Truths.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 76–88}}{{refn|group=note|Gowans groups the objections into three categories.

The third objection can be called "morality objection", which asks "why presume that an infant born with an illness, is because of karma in previous life" as seems implied by ''Majjhima Nikāya'' section 3.204 for example.

Simply putting an end to rebirth would not necessarily strike the western Buddhist as the ultimate answer, as it certainly was for early Indian Buddhists.{{sfn|Konik|2009|p=ix}}}}

According to Keown, it is possible to reinterpret the Buddhist doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths, since the final goal and the answer to the problem of suffering is [[nirvana]], and not rebirth.{{sfn|Keown|2009|p=60–63, 74-85, 185-187}} Some Western interpreters have proposed what is sometimes referred to as "naturalized Buddhism". It is devoid of rebirth, karma, nirvana, realms of existence, and other concepts of Buddhism, with doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths reformulated and restated in modernistic terms.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 91–94}}{{sfn|Prothero|1996|p=128}}{{refn|group=note|Prothereo describes how Theosophist [[Henry Steel Olcott]] (1832-1907) reinterpreted Buddhism: "In addition to a restatement of the Four Noble Truths and the Five Precepts for lay Buddhists, the fourteen propositions included: an affirmation of religious tolerance and of the evolution of the universe, a rejection of supernaturalism, heaven or hell, and superstition, and an emphasis on education and the use of reason."{{sfn|Prothero|1996|p=128}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Owen Flanagan, the proportion of people in North America that believe in heaven is about the same as the proportion of East and Southeast Asia who believe in rebirth. But, 'rebirth' is considered superstitious by many in the West while 'heaven' is not, adds Flanagan, though a reflective naturalistic approach demands that both 'heaven' and 'rebirth' be equally questioned".{{sfn|Flanagan|2011|p=2–3, 68–70, 79–80}} According to Donald S. Lopez, Buddhist movements in the West have reconstructed a "Scientific Buddha" and a "modern Buddhism" unknown in Asia, "one that may never have existed there before the late  19th-century".{{sfn|Lopez|2012|p=39-43, 57–60, 74-76, 122-124}}}} This "deflated secular Buddhism" stresses compassion, impermanence, causality, selfless persons, no Boddhisattvas, no nirvana, no rebirth, and a naturalists approach to well-being of oneself and others.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=39–42}}

According to Melford Spiro, this approach undermines the Four Noble Truths, for it does not address the existential question for the Buddhist as to "why live? why not commit suicide, hasten the end of ''dukkha'' in current life by ending life". In traditional Buddhism, rebirth continues the ''dukkha'' and the path to cessation of ''dukkha'' isn't suicide, but the fourth reality of the Four Noble Truths.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=39–42}} The "naturalized Buddhism", according to Gowans, is a radical revision to traditional Buddhist thought and practice, and it attacks the structure behind the hopes, needs and rationalization of the realities of human life to traditional Buddhists in East, Southeast and South Asia.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 91–94}} According to Keown, it may not be necessary to believe in some of the core Buddhist doctrines to be a Buddhist, but the rebirth, karma, [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|realms of existence]] and cyclic universe doctrines underpin the Four Noble Truths in Buddhism.{{sfn|Keown|2009|p=60–63, 74-85, 185-187}}

Traditional Buddhist scholars disagree with these modernist Western interpretations. Bhikkhu Bodhi, for example, states that rebirth is an integral part of the Buddhist teachings as found in the sutras, despite the problems that "modernist interpreters of Buddhism" seem to have with it.&lt;ref group=web name="BB-rebirth"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Bhikkhu Bodhi: "Newcomers to Buddhism are usually impressed by the clarity, directness, and earthy practicality of the Dhamma as embodied in such basic teachings as the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the threefold training. These teachings, as clear as day-light, are accessible to any serious seeker looking for a way beyond suffering. When, however, these seekers encounter the doctrine of rebirth, they often balk, convinced it just doesn't make sense. At this point, they suspect that the teaching has swerved off course, tumbling from the grand highway of reason into wistfulness and speculation. Even modernist interpreters of Buddhism seem to have trouble taking the rebirth teaching seriously. Some dismiss it as just a piece of cultural baggage, "ancient Indian metaphysics," that the Buddha retained in deference to the world view of his age. Others interpret it as a metaphor for the change of mental states, with the realms of rebirth seen as symbols for psychological archetypes. A few critics even question the authenticity of the texts on rebirth, arguing that they must be interpolations.&lt;br&gt;A quick glance at the Pali suttas would show that none of these claims has much substance. The teaching of rebirth crops up almost everywhere in the Canon, and is so closely bound to a host of other doctrines that to remove it would virtually reduce the Dhamma to tatters. Moreover, when the suttas speak about rebirth into the five realms — the hells, the animal world, the spirit realm, the human world, and the heavens — they never hint that these terms are meant symbolically. To the contrary, they even say that rebirth occurs "with the breakup of the body, after death," which clearly implies they intend the idea of rebirth to be taken quite literally."&lt;ref group=web name="BB-rebirth"/&gt;}} [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], as another example, rejects the "modern argument" that "one can still obtain all the results of the practice without having to accept the possibility of rebirth." He states, "rebirth has always been a central teaching in the Buddhist tradition."&lt;ref group=web name="TB_Rebirth"&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/truth_of_rebirth.html ''The Truth of Rebirth. And Why it Matters for Buddhist Practice'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|Thanissaro Bhikkhu: "A second modern argument against accepting the canonical accounts of what's known in awakening — and in particular, the knowledge of rebirth achieved in awakening — is that one can still obtain all the results of the practice without having to accept the possibility of rebirth. After all, all the factors leading to suffering are all immediately present to awareness, so there should be no need, when trying to abandon them, to accept any premises about where they may or may not lead in the future.&lt;br&gt;This objection, however, ignores the role of appropriate attention on the path. As we noted above, one of its roles is to examine and abandon the assumptions that underlie one's views on the metaphysics of personal identity. Unless you're willing to step back from your own views — such as those concerning what a person is, and why that makes rebirth impossible — and subject them to this sort of examination, there's something lacking in your path. You'll remain entangled in the questions of inappropriate attention, which will prevent you from actually identifying and abandoning the causes of suffering and achieving the full results of the practice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, the terms of appropriate attention — the four noble truths — are not concerned simply with events arising and passing away in the present moment. They also focus on the causal connections among those events, connections that occur both in the immediate present and over time. If you limit your focus solely to connections in the present while ignoring those over time, you can't fully comprehend the ways in which craving causes suffering: not only by latching on to the four kinds of nutriment, but also giving rise to the four kinds of nutriment as well.&lt;ref group=web name="TB_Rebirth"/&gt;}}{{refn|group=note|According to Konik: {{quote|No doubt, according to the early Indian Buddhist tradition, the Buddha's great discovery, as condensed in his experience of nirvana, involved the remembrance of his many former existences, presupposing as fact the reality of a never-ending process of rebirth as a source of deep anxiety, and an acceptance of the Buddha's overcoming of that fate as ultimate liberation.{{sfn|Konik|2009|p=ix}}}}}}

According to Owen Flanagan, the Dalai Lama states that "Buddhists believe in rebirth" and that this belief has been common among his followers. However, the Dalai Lama's belief, adds Flanagan, is more sophisticated than ordinary Buddhists, because it is not the same as [[reincarnation]]--rebirth in Buddhism is envisioned as happening without the assumption of an "atman, self, soul", but rather through a "consciousness conceived along the [[anatta|anatman]] lines".{{sfn|Flanagan|2014|pp=233-234 with note 1}}{{refn|group=note|The Dalai Lama himself is regarded to be an incarnation of the thirteen previous Dalai Lamas, who are all manifestations of [[Avalokitasvara]].{{sfn|Chitkara|1998|p=39}}}} The doctrine of rebirth is considered mandatory in Tibetan Buddhism, and across many Buddhist sects.{{sfn|Flanagan|2014|pp=234-235 with note 5}}

According to Christopher Gowans, for "most ordinary Buddhists, today as well as in the past, their basic moral orientation is governed by belief in karma and rebirth".{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 76–88}} Buddhist morality hinges on the hope of well being in this lifetime or in future rebirths, with nirvana (enlightenment) a project for a future lifetime. A denial of karma and rebirth undermines their history, moral orientation and religious foundations.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 76–88}} According to Keown, most Buddhists in Asia do accept these traditional teachings, and seek better rebirth.{{sfn|Keown|2009|p=60–63, 74-85, 185-187}}{{refn|group=note|The vast majority of Buddhist lay people, states Kevin Trainor, have historically pursued Buddhist rituals and practices motivated with rebirth into Deva realm.{{sfn|Trainor|2004|p=62}} Fowler and others concur with Trainor, stating that better rebirth, not nirvana, has been the primary focus of a vast majority of lay Buddhists. This they attempt through merit accumulation and good ''kamma''.{{sfn|Fowler|1999|p=65}}{{refn|group=note|Merv Foweler: "For a vast majority of Buddhists in Theravadin countries, however, the order of monks is seen by lay Buddhists as a means of gaining the most merit in the hope of accumulating good karma for a better rebirth."{{sfn|Fowler|1999|p=65}}}}{{sfn|Gowans|2004|p=169}}}}

Gone, for instance, were the doctrines of karma and rebirth, the traditional emphasis on renunciation of the world, the practice of meditation, and the experience of enlightenment. Gone too were any teachings that implied the existence of a trans-empirical realm (...). Most jarring, perhaps, especially among more traditional Buddhists, was the absence of the Four Noble Truths, which Ambedkar regarded as the invention of wrong-headed monks".&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], '''fractional quantum mechanics''' is a generalization of standard [[quantum mechanics]], which naturally comes out when the Brownian-like quantum paths substitute with the Lévy-like ones in the [[Feynman path integral]]. It has been discovered by [[Nick Laskin]] who coined the term ''fractional quantum mechanics''.&lt;ref&gt;N. Laskin, (2000), [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0375-9601(00)00201-2 Fractional Quantum Mechanics and Lévy Path Integrals. ''Physics Letters'' 268A, 298-304].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals==
Standard quantum mechanics can be approached in three different ways: the [[matrix mechanics]], the [[Schrödinger equation]] and the [[Feynman path integral]].

The [[Feynman path integral]]&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Feynman and A. R. Hibbs, Quantum Mechanics and Path Integrals ~McGraw-Hill, New York, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; is the path integral over Brownian-like quantum-mechanical paths. Fractional quantum mechanics has been discovered by [[Nick Laskin]] (1999) as a result of expanding the [[Feynman path integral]], from the Brownian-like to the Lévy-like quantum mechanical paths. A path integral over the Lévy-like quantum-mechanical paths results in a generalization of [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Laskin, (2000), [http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v62/i3/p3135_1 Fractional Quantum Mechanics, ''Physical Review'' E62, 3135-3145]. '' (also available online: https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1769)&lt;/ref&gt; If the [[Feynman path integral]] leads to the well known [[Schrödinger equation]], then the path integral over [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Lévy]] trajectories leads to the [[fractional Schrödinger equation]].&lt;ref&gt;N. Laskin, (2002), [http://pre.aps.org/abstract/PRE/v66/i5/e056108 Fractional Schrödinger equation, ''Physical Review'' E66, 056108 7 pages]. '' (also available online: https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206098)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lévy process]] is characterized
by the Lévy index ''α'', 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''α''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;2. At the special case when ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 the [[Lévy process]] becomes the process of [[Brownian motion]]. The fractional Schrödinger equation includes a space [[derivative]] of fractional order ''α'' instead of the second order (''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2) space derivative in the standard Schrödinger equation. Thus, the fractional Schrödinger equation is a [[fractional differential equation]] in accordance with modern terminology.&lt;ref&gt;S. G. Samko, A. A. Kilbas, and O. I. Marichev, Fractional
Integrals and Derivatives, Theory and Applications ~Gordon
and Breach, Amsterdam, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; This is the key point to launch the term [[fractional Schrödinger equation]] and more general term ''fractional quantum mechanics''. As mentioned above, at ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 the Lévy motion becomes [[Brownian motion]]. Thus, fractional quantum mechanics includes standard quantum mechanics as a particular case at ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. The quantum-mechanical path integral over the Lévy paths at ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 becomes the well-known [[Feynman path integral]] and the [[fractional Schrödinger equation]] becomes the well-known [[Schrödinger equation]].

=== Fractional Schrödinger equation ===

The [[fractional Schrödinger equation]] discovered by [[Nick Laskin]] has the following form (see, Refs.[1,3,4])

: &lt;math&gt;i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi (\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t}=D_\alpha (-\hbar
^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2}\psi (\mathbf{r},t)+V(\mathbf{r},t)\psi (\mathbf{r},t)\, &lt;/math&gt;

using the standard definitions:
*'''r''' is the 3-dimensional [[position vector]], 
*''ħ'' is the reduced [[Planck constant]], 
*''ψ''('''r''', ''t'') is the [[wavefunction]], which is the quantum mechanical function that determines the probability amplitude for the particle to have a given position '''r''' at any given time ''t'', 
*''V''('''r''', ''t'') is a [[potential energy]], 
*Δ = &amp;part;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&amp;part;'''r'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[Laplace operator]].

Further,
*''D&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a scale constant with [[dimensional analysis|physical dimension]] [D&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;] = [energy]&lt;sup&gt;1 − ''α''&lt;/sup&gt;·[length]&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;[time]&lt;sup&gt;−''α''&lt;/sup&gt;, at ''α''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; =1/2''m'', where ''m'' is a particle mass,
*the operator (−''ħ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Δ)&lt;sup&gt;''α''/2&lt;/sup&gt; is the 3-dimensional fractional quantum Riesz derivative defined by (see, Refs.[3, 4]);

::&lt;math&gt;
(-\hbar ^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2}\psi (\mathbf{r},t)=\frac 1{(2\pi \hbar
)^3}\int d^3pe^{i \mathbf{p}\cdot \mathbf{r}/\hbar}|\mathbf{p}|^\alpha \varphi (
\mathbf{p},t),
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the wave functions in the [[position and momentum space]]s; &lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \varphi (\mathbf{p},t)&lt;/math&gt; are related each other by the 3-dimensional [[Fourier transform]]s:

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi (\mathbf{r},t)=\frac 1{(2\pi \hbar )^3}\int d^3pe^{i \mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}/\hbar}\varphi (\mathbf{p},t),\qquad \varphi (\mathbf{p},t)=\int d^3re^{-i
\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r}/\hbar }\psi (\mathbf{r},t).
&lt;/math&gt;

The index ''α'' in the fractional Schrödinger equation is the Lévy index, 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''α''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;2.

=== Fractional quantum mechanics in solid state systems ===
The effective mass of states in solid state systems can depend on the wave vector k, i.e. formally one considers m=m(k). Polariton Bose-Einstein condensate modes are examples of states in solid state systems with mass sensitive to variations and locally in k fractional quantum mechanics is experimentally feasible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21077">The '''framing effect''' is an example of [[cognitive bias]], in which people react to a particular choice in different ways depending on how it is presented; e.g. as a loss or as a gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plous|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; People tend to avoid risk when a positive frame is presented but seek risks when a negative frame is presented.&lt;ref name=TandK&gt;{{harvnb|Tversky|Kahneman|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gain and loss are defined in the scenario as descriptions of outcomes (e.g., lives lost or saved, disease patients treated and not treated, lives saved and lost during accidents, etc.).

[[Prospect theory]] shows that a loss is more significant than the equivalent gain,&lt;ref name=TandK/&gt; that a sure gain ([[certainty effect]] and [[pseudocertainty effect]]) is favored over a probabilistic gain,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that a probabilistic loss is preferred to a definite loss.&lt;ref name=TandK/&gt; One of the dangers of framing effects is that people are often provided with options within the context of only one of the two frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Druckman|2001a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept helps to develop an understanding of [[framing (social sciences)|frame analysis]] within [[social movement]]s, and also in the formation of [[political science|political opinion]] where [[Spin (public relations)|spin]] plays a large role in [[Opinion poll|political opinion polls]] that are framed to encourage a response beneficial to the organization that has commissioned the poll. It has been suggested that the use of the technique is discrediting political polls themselves.&lt;ref name=Druckman2001b&gt;{{harvnb|Druckman|2001b}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is reduced, or even eliminated, if ample credible information is provided to people.&lt;ref name=Druckman2001b/&gt;

==Research==
[[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] explored how different phrasing affected participants' responses to a choice in a hypothetical life and death situation in 1981.&lt;ref name=TandK/&gt;

Participants were asked to choose between two treatments for 600 people affected by a deadly disease. Treatment A was predicted to result in 400 deaths, whereas treatment B had a 33% chance that no one would die but a 66% chance that everyone would die. This choice was then presented to participants either with positive framing, i.e. how many people would live, or with negative framing, i.e. how many people would die.

!Framing
!Treatment A
!Treatment B
|-
|Positive
|"Saves 200 lives"
|"A 33% chance of saving all 600 people, 66% possibility of saving no one."
|-
|Negative
|"400 people will die"
|"A 33% chance that no people will die, 66% probability that all 600 will die."
|-
|}

Treatment A was chosen by 72% of participants when it was presented with positive framing ("saves 200 lives") dropping to 22% when the same choice was presented with negative framing ("400 people will die").

This effect has been shown in other contexts:
* 93% of PhD students registered early when a penalty fee for late registration was emphasized, with only 67% doing so when this was presented as a discount for earlier registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gächter|Orzen|Renner|Stamer|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 62% of people disagreed with allowing "public condemnation of democracy", but only 46% of people agreed that it was right to "forbid public condemnation of democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Rugg, as cited in {{harvnb|Plous|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* More people will support an economic policy if the employment rate is emphasised than when the associated unemployment rates is highlighted.&lt;ref name=Druckman2001b/&gt;
* It has been argued that [[pretrial detention]] may increase a defendant's willingness to accept a plea bargain, since imprisonment, rather than freedom, will be his baseline, and pleading guilty will be viewed as an event that will cause his earlier release rather than as an event that will put him in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Plea Bargaining outside the Shadow of Trial |first=Stephanos |last=Bibas |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |volume=117 |issue=8 |year=2004 |pages=2463–47 |jstor=4093404 |ssrn= 464880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extensionality violation===
In logic, [[extensionality]] requires "two formulas which have the same truth-value under any truth-assignments to be mutually substitutable ''[[salva veritate]]'' in a sentence that contains one of these formulas."&lt;ref name="BG09"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bourgeois-Gironde|first1=Sacha|last2=Giraud|first2=Raphaël|title=Framing effects as violations of extensionality|journal=Theory and Decision|volume=67|issue=4|year=2009|pages=385–404|issn=0040-5833|doi=10.1007/s11238-009-9133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply, objects that have the same external properties are equal. This principle, applied to decision making, suggests that making a decision in a problem should not be affected by how the problem is described. For example, varied descriptions of the same decision problem should not give rise to different decisions, due to the extensionality principle. If judgments are made on the bases of irrelevant information as described, that is called an extensionality violation.&lt;ref name="BG09" /&gt;

===Criticism===
Tversky's and Kahneman's research has later been criticized for a subtle difference between the phrasings of the options in the two scenarios. Since the description of treatment A in the positive framing does not explicitly state that 400 people will die, nor does the description of treatment A in the negative framing state that 200 people will live, the probability of these consequences being 100% is only implied. This implication is, however, obvious only if one can familiarize themselves with both framings, as opposed to the respondents who participated in the experiment and saw only one of the framings, either the positive or the negative. In their case, it is possible to assume, with the positive framing, that by choosing the option A, the probability of more than 200 people being saved is greater than zero. Respectively, if introduced only to the negative framing, it is possible to assume that by choosing option A, the probability of more than 400 people dying is greater than zero. According to these assumptions, it would indeed be rational for the respondents to choose A over B when introduced to the positive framing, and B over A when introduced to the negative framing, since the two framings in case of treatment A are not truly mutually substitutable. In other words, the statement "200 of 600 lives will be saved" is not mutually substitutable with the statement "400 of 600 people will die".

==Developmental factors==

The framing effect has consistently proven to be one of the strongest biases in decision making.&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = A. K. | last2 = Millar | first2 = P.

This leads to more deliberation, which can affect decision making, resulting in decisions that are more systematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keysar|first1=Boaz|last2=Hayakawa|first2=Sayuri|last3=An|first3=Sun Gyu|title=The Foreign-Language Effect : Thinking in a Foreign Tongue Reduces Decision Biases|url=http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/foreignLanguaeEffect.pdf|website=University of Chicago: Psychology|publisher=Psychological Science|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood and adolescence===
Framing effects in decision-making become stronger as children age.&lt;ref name=reyna&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Reyna | first1 = V. F. | last2 = Farley | first2 = F. | doi = 10.1111/j.1529-1006.2006.00026.x | title = Risk and Rationality in Adolescent Decision Making: Implications for Theory, Practice, and Public Policy | journal = Psychological Science in the Public Interest | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–44 | year = 2006 | pmid =  26158695| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Albert&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = D. | last2 = Steinberg | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00724.x | title = Judgment and Decision Making in Adolescence | journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence | volume = 21 | page = 211 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strough&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Strough | first1 = J. | last2 = Karns | first2 = T.

F. | title = A Theory of Medical Decision Making and Health: Fuzzy Trace Theory | doi = 10.1177/0272989X08327066 | journal = Medical Decision Making | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 850–65 | year = 2008 | pmid =  19015287| pmc =2617718 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, qualitative reasoning, and thus susceptibility to framing effects, is still not as strong in adolescents as in adults,&lt;ref name=reyna/&gt;&lt;ref name=Strough/&gt; and adolescents are more likely than adults to choose the risky option under both the gain and loss frames of a given scenario.&lt;ref name=Albert/&gt; One explanation for adolescent tendencies toward risky choices is that they lack real-world experience with negative consequences, and thus over-rely on conscious evaluation of risks and benefits,&lt;ref name=Albert/&gt; focusing on specific information and details or quantitative analysis.&lt;ref name=Tring&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schlottmann | first1 = A. | last2 = Tring | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1024/1421-0185.64.3.153 | title = How Children Reason about Gains and Losses: Framing Effects in Judgement and Choice | journal = Swiss Journal of Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 3 | page = 153 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduces influence of framing effects and leads to greater consistency across frames of a given scenario.&lt;ref name=Tring/&gt; Children between the ages of 10 and 12 are more likely to take risks and show framing effects, while younger children only considered the quantitative differences between the two options presented.&lt;ref name=Boyer&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Boyer | first1 = T. | title = The development of risk-taking: A multi-perspective review | doi = 10.1016/j.dr.2006.05.002 | journal = Developmental Review | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 291–345 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Young adulthood===
Younger adults are more likely than older adults to be enticed by risk-taking when presented with loss frame trials.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;

In multiple studies of undergraduate students, researchers have found that students are more likely to prefer options framed positively.&lt;ref name="revlin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cognition: Theory and Practice|last1=Revlin|first1=Russell|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2012|isbn=978-0716756675|location=New York, New York|chapter=Chapter 11: Solving Problems}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2013-04-19--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they are more likely to enjoy meat labeled 75% lean meat as opposed to 25% fat, or use condoms advertised as being 95% effective as opposed to having a 5% risk of failure.&lt;ref name=revlin/&gt;

Young adults are especially susceptible to framing effects when presented with an ill-defined problem in which there is no correct answer and individuals must arbitrarily determine what information they consider relevant.&lt;ref name=revlin/&gt; For example, undergraduate students are more willing to purchase an item such as a movie ticket after losing an amount equivalent to the item's cost than after losing the item itself.&lt;ref name=revlin/&gt;

===Older adulthood===
The framing effect is greater in older adults than in younger adults or adolescents.&lt;ref name=Erber/&gt;&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; This may be a result of enhanced [[negativity bias]],&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; though some sources claim that the negativity bias actually decreases with age.&lt;ref name=carpenter/&gt; Another possible cause is that older adults have fewer cognitive resources available to them and are more likely to default to less cognitively demanding strategies when faced with a decision.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; They tend to rely on easily accessible information, or frames, regardless of whether that information is relevant to making the decision in question.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; Several studies have shown that younger adults will make less biased decisions than older adults because they base their choices on interpretations of patterns of events and can better employ decision making strategies that require cognitive resources like working-memory skills. Older adults, on the other hand, make choices based on immediate reactions to gains and losses.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;

Older adults' lack of cognitive resources, such as flexibility in decision making strategies, may cause older adults to be influenced by emotional frames more so than younger adults or adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Watanabe | first1 = S. | last2 = Shibutani | first2 = H. | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-5884.2010.00432.x | title = Aging and decision making: Differences in susceptibility to the risky-choice framing effect between older and younger adults in Japan | journal = Japanese Psychological Research | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | page = 163 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as individuals age, they make decisions more quickly than their younger counterparts.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; It is significant that, when prompted to do so, older adults will often make a less biased decision with reevaluation of their original choice.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Erber/&gt;

The increase in framing effects among older adults has important implications, especially in medical contexts.&lt;ref name=Erber/&gt;&lt;ref name=peters/&gt;&lt;ref name=rice/&gt; Older adults are influenced heavily by the inclusion or exclusion of extraneous details, meaning they are likely to make serious medical decisions based on how doctors frame the two options rather than the qualitative differences between the options, causing older adults to inappropriately form their choices.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;

When considering cancer treatments, framing can shift older adults' focus from short- to long-term survival under a negative and positive frame, respectively.&lt;ref name=Erber/&gt; When presented with treatment descriptions described in positive, negative, or neutral terms, older adults are significantly more likely to agree to a treatment when it is positively described than they are to agree to the same treatment when it is described neutrally or negatively.&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; Additionally, framing often leads to inconsistency in choice: a change in description qualities after an initial choice is made can cause older adults to revoke their initial decision in favor of an alternative option.&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; Older adults also remember positively framed statements more accurately than negatively framed statements.&lt;ref name=Erber/&gt;&lt;ref name=L&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Löckenhoff | first1 = C.

==1964–1965==

===Background===
In 1958, activist students organized [[SLATE]], a campus political party meaning a "slate" of candidates running on the same level – a same "slate." The students created SLATE to promote the right of student groups to support off-campus issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Dayna | last = Holz |url=http://www.slatearchives.org/history.htm |title=SLATE History |publisher= SLATE Archives |accessdate= 2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fall of 1964, student activists, some of whom had traveled with the [[Freedom Riders]] and worked to register [[African American]] voters in Mississippi in the [[Freedom Summer]] project, set up information tables on campus and were soliciting donations for causes connected to the [[Civil Rights Movement]].  According to existing rules at the time, fundraising for political parties was limited exclusively to the Democratic and Republican school clubs.  There was also a mandatory "[[loyalty oath]]" required of faculty, which had led to dismissals and ongoing controversy over academic freedom.  [[Sol Stern]], a former radical who took part in the Free Speech Movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/hearing-echoes-berkeley-student-activism-today/|title=Hearing echoes of Berkeley in student activism today|date=October 16, 2014|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated in a 2014 [[City Journal (New York City)|City Journal]] article that the group viewed the United States to be both racist and imperialistic and that the main intent after lifting Berkeley's loyalty oath was to build on the legacy of [[C. Wright Mills|C Wright Mills]] and weaken the Cold War consensus by promoting the ideas of the [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref name="cityjournal"/&gt;

On September 14, 1964, Dean [[Katherine Towle]] announced that existing University regulations prohibiting advocacy of political causes or candidates, outside political speakers, recruitment of members, and fundraising by student organizations at the intersection of Bancroft and [[Telegraph Avenue|Telegraph]] Avenues would be "strictly enforced."&lt;ref name="uic.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/jofreeman/sixtiesprotest/berkeley.htm|title=Sixties Protest|work=uic.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jack Weinberg and sit-in===

On October 1, 1964, former graduate student [[Jack Weinberg]] was sitting at the [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]] table. He refused to show his identification to the campus police and was arrested. There was a spontaneous movement of students to surround the police car in which he was to be transported. The police car remained there for 32 hours, all while Weinberg was inside it. At one point, there may have been 3,000 students around the car.
The car was used as a speaker's podium and a continuous public discussion was held which continued until the charges against Weinberg were dropped.&lt;ref name="uic.edu"/&gt;
[[File:MarioSavio.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mario Savio]] leading a rally on the steps of [[Sproul Hall]] in 1966]]
On December 2, between 1,500 and 4,000 students went into [[Sproul Hall]] as a last resort in order to re-open negotiations with the administration on the subject of restrictions on political speech and action on campus.&lt;ref name="uic.edu"/&gt; Among other grievances was the fact that four of their leaders were being singled out for punishment. The demonstration was orderly; students studied, watched movies, and sang folk songs. [[Joan Baez]] was there to lead in the singing, as well as lend moral support. "Freedom classes" were held by teaching assistants on one floor, and a special Channukah service took place in the main lobby. On the steps of Sproul Hall, [[Mario Savio]]&lt;ref name=berk1960s&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2013/08/28/berkeley-in-the-sixties-aims-to-affect-the-present |title='Berkeley in the Sixties' aims to affect the present |first=Grace |last=Lovio |date=August 28, 2013 |work=[[The Daily Californian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave a famous speech:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;But we're a bunch of raw materials that don't mean to be — have any process upon us. Don't mean to be made into any product! Don't mean — Don't mean to end up being bought by some clients of the University, be they the government, be they industry, be they organized labor, be they anyone! We're human beings! ... &amp;nbsp;There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious — makes you so sick at heart — that you can't take part. You can't even passively take part. And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop. And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mariosaviosproulhallsitin.htm American Rhetoric - Mario Savio].  See also Robert Cohen, '' Freedom's Orator,'' pp. 178-179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At midnight, Alameda County deputy district attorney [[Edwin Meese|Edwin Meese III]] telephoned Governor [[Pat Brown|Edmund Brown Sr.]], asking for authority to proceed with a [[mass arrest]]. Shortly after 2 a.m. on December 4, 1964, police cordoned off the building, and at 3:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. began the arrest. Close to 800 students were arrested,&lt;ref name="uic.edu"/&gt; most of which were transported by bus to [[Santa Rita Jail]] in [[Dublin, California|Dublin]], about 25 miles away. They were released on their own recognizance after a few hours behind bars. About a month later, the university brought charges against the students who organized the [[sit-in]], resulting in an even larger student protest that all but shut down the university.

===Aftermath===
After much disturbance, the University officials slowly backed down.  By January 3, 1965, the new acting chancellor, [[Martin Meyerson]] (who had replaced the previous resigned [[Edward Strong]]), established provisional rules for political activity on the Berkeley campus. He designated the Sproul Hall steps an open discussion area during certain hours of the day and permitting tables. This applied to the entire student political spectrum, not just the liberal elements that drove the Free Speech Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt9h4nb3hd/ |title=Time, Place and Manner Statement |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most outsiders, however, identified the Free Speech Movement as a movement of the Left.  Students and others opposed to U.S. foreign policy did indeed increase their visibility on campus following the FSM's initial victory.  In the spring of 1965, the FSM was followed by the [[Vietnam Day Committee]],&lt;ref name="uic.edu"/&gt; a major starting point for the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam war]] movement.

===Achievements===
For the first time, disobedience tactics of the Civil Rights Movement were brought by the Free Speech Movement to a college campus in the 1960s. Those approaches gave the students exceptional leverage to make demands of the university administrators, and build the foundation for future protests, such as the against the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fsm.berkeley.edu/free-speech-movement-timeline/|title=Visual History: Free Speech Movement, 1964 {{!}} Berkeley FSM|website=fsm.berkeley.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1966–1970==

The Free Speech Movement had long-lasting effects at the Berkeley campus and was a pivotal moment for the civil liberties movement in the 1960s.  It was seen as the beginning of the famous student activism that existed on the campus in the 1960s, and continues to a lesser degree today.  There was a substantial voter backlash against the individuals involved in the Free Speech Movement.  [[Ronald Reagan]] won an unexpected victory in the fall of 1966 and was elected [[Governor of California|Governor]].&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/06/08_reagan.shtml |title=Ronald Reagan launched political career using the Berkeley campus as a political target |publisher=Berkeley.edu |date=2004-06-08 |accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then directed the [[Regents of the University of California|UC Board of Regents]] to dismiss UC President [[Clark Kerr]] because of the perception that he had been too soft on the protesters. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] kept secret files on Kerr and Savio, and subjected their lives and careers to interference under [[COINTELPRO]].

Reagan had gained political traction by campaigning on a platform to "clean up the mess in Berkeley".&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt; In the minds of those involved in the backlash, a wide variety of protests, concerned citizens, and [[activist]]s were lumped together.  Furthermore, [[television news]] and [[documentary film]]making had made it possible to photograph and broadcast moving images of protest activity.  Much of this media is available today as part of the permanent collection of the Bancroft Library at Berkeley, including iconic photographs of the protest activity by student Ron Enfield (then chief photographer for the Berkeley campus newspaper, the ''[[The Daily Californian|Daily Cal]]'').&lt;ref name="bancroft.berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|author=Elizabeth Stephens |url=http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/FSM/fsm_ead.html |title=Free Speech Movement Archival Collection Guides |publisher=Bancroft.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reproduction of what may be considered the most recognizable and iconic photograph of the movement, a shot of suit-clad students carrying the Free Speech banner through the University's [[Sather Gate]] in Fall of 1964, now stands at the entrance to the college's [[Moffitt Library#Free Speech Movement Cafe|Free Speech Movement Cafe]].&lt;ref name="bancroft.berkeley.edu"/&gt;

Earlier protests against the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] meeting in [[San Francisco]] in 1960 had included an iconic scene as protesters were literally washed down the steps inside the Rotunda of [[San Francisco City Hall]] with fire hoses.  The anti-Communist film ''Operation Abolition''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeiW63M3bcI "Operation Abolition," 1960 - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894425-1,00.html Operation Abolition]", ''Time'' magazine, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsCfYYi2FE Operation Abolition (1960) - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/operation-abolition/ Operation Abolition]", video.google.com and ''Time'' magazine, Friday, Mar. 17, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; depicted this scene and became an organizing tool for the protesters.

==Reunions==
The 20th anniversary reunion of the FSM was held during the first week of October, 1984, to considerable media attention.  A rally in Sproul Plaza featured FSM veterans Mario Savio, who ended a long self-imposed silence, Jack Weinberg, and Jackie Goldberg.  The week continued with a series of panels open to the public on the movement and its impact.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Ludlow, "Savio Breaks 20-year silence about Free Speech Movement," ''San Francisco Examiner'', September 30, 1984, p. A10; Stacy E. Palmer, "Berkeley, Birthplace of 1960's Unrest, Tries to Preserve Its Activist Image," ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', September 26, 1984, pp. 12-14; and Lynn Ludlow, "The Free Speech revolutionaries, 20 years later,"  the first of six parts, ''San Francisco Examiner'', December 9, 1984, pp. A1, A14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 30th anniversary reunion, held during the first weekend of December 1994, was also a public event, with another Sproul Plaza rally featuring Savio, Weinberg, Goldberg, panels on the FSM, and current free speech issues.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Herscher, "Echoes of Free Speech Movement Heard 30 Years Later," ''San Francisco Chronicle'', December 2, 1994, pp. A19, A23.&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2001, UC's [[Bancroft Library]] held a symposium celebrating the opening of the Free Speech Movement Digital Archive.  Although not a formal FSM reunion, many FSM leaders were on the panels and other participants were in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;"Taking Part: FSM and the Legacy of Social Protest," brochure published by the Bancroft Library for the April 13–14, 2001 symposium.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 40th anniversary reunion, the first after Savio's death in 1996, was held in October 2004. It featured columnist [[Molly Ivins]] giving the annual Mario Savio Memorial Lecture, followed later in the week by the customary rally in Sproul Plaza and panels on civil liberties issues.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Burress, "UC's change of heart - celebrating transformation of a pariah into an icon," ''San Francisco Chronicle'', October 6, 2004, p. B1, B5; Charles Burress, "Celebrating 4 decades of mouthing off," ''San Francisco Chronicle'', October 8, 2004, p. B5; Charles Burress, "Free speech returns to Sproul," ''San Francisco Chronicle'', October 9, 2004, p. B1,B5; Meredith May, "40 years on Free Speechers talk all they want," ''San Francisco Chronicle'', October 11, 2004, p. B5.&lt;/ref&gt;  A Sunday meeting was a more private event, primarily a gathering for the veterans of the movement, in remembrance of Savio and of a close FSM ally, professor Reginald Zelnik, who had died in an accident in May.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Saxon, "Reginald Zelnik, 68, Historian of Labor Movements in Russia," ''The New York Times'', June 1, 2004, p. C13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
[[File:Free Speech Monument Sproul Plaza Berkeley California.jpg|thumb|Free Speech Monument Sproul Plaza Berkeley California]]

Today, Sproul Hall and the surrounding [[Sproul Plaza]] are active locations for protests and marches, as well as the ordinary daily tables with free literature from anyone of any political orientation who wishes to appear. A wide variety of groups of all political, religious and social persuasions set up tables at Sproul Plaza. The Sproul steps, now officially known as the "Mario Savio Steps", may be reserved by anyone for a speech or rally.&lt;ref name="uic.edu"/&gt;  An on-campus restaurant commemorating the event, the Mario Savio Free Speech Movement Cafe, resides in a portion of the [[Moffitt Library|Moffitt Undergraduate Library]].

The Free Speech Monument, commemorating the movement, was created in 1991 by artist Mark Brest van Kempen.  It is located, appropriately, in Sproul Plaza.  The monument consists of a six-inch hole in the ground filled with soil and a granite ring surrounding it.  The granite ring bears the inscription, "This soil and the air space extending above it shall not be a part of any nation and shall not be subject to any entity's jurisdiction."  The monument makes no explicit reference to the movement, but it evokes notions of free speech and its implications through its rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenmuseum.org/content/work_index/work_id-99__artist_id-51.html Free Speech Monument, Mark Brest Van Kempen]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Futurism''' ({{lang-it|Futurismo}}) was an [[Art movement|artistic]] and [[social movement]] that originated in [[Italy]] in the early 20th century. It emphasized speed, technology, youth, violence, and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city. Its key figures were the Italians [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Gino Severini]], [[Giacomo Balla]], and [[Luigi Russolo]]. It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past.&lt;ref name="20th-Century art book"&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|title=The 20th-Century art book|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=dsdLondon|isbn=978-0714835426|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cubism]] contributed to the formation of Italian Futurism's artistic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnason|last2=Harvard|first2=H.|last3=Mansfield|first3=Elizabeth|title=History of Modern Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, Photography|date=December 2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0205259472|pages=189|edition=Seventh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important Futurist works included Marinetti's ''[[Manifesto of Futurism]]'', Boccioni's sculpture ''[[Unique Forms of Continuity in Space]]'', Balla's painting ''[[Abstract Speed + Sound]]'', and Russolo's ''[[The Art of Noises]]''. Although it was largely an [[Italians|Italian]] phenomenon, there were parallel movements in [[Russia]], [[England]], [[Belgium]] and elsewhere. The Futurists practiced in every medium of art, including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and even [[Futurist meals]]. To some extent Futurism influenced the art movements [[Art Deco]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Dada]], and to a greater degree [[Precisionism]], [[Rayonism]], and [[Vorticism]].

==Italian Futurism==
Futurism is an avant-garde movement founded in Milan in 1909 by the Italian poet [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].&lt;ref name="20th-Century art book"/&gt;  Marinetti launched the movement in his ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/imanifestidelfut28144gut Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, ''I manifesti del futurismo'', February 20, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; which he published for the first time on 5 February 1909 in ''La gazzetta dell'Emilia'', an article then reproduced in  the French daily newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' on Saturday 20 February 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2883730/f1.image Le Figaro, ''Le Futurisme'', 1909/02/20 (Numéro 51)]. Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaai190904-01.2.3&amp;srpos=8&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-futurism------ Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, ''Declaration of Futurism'', published in Poesia, Volume 5, Number 6, April 1909] (Futurist manifesto translated to English). Blue Mountain Project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Futurist Aristocracy"&gt;[http://monoskop.org/images/7/73/Futurist_Aristocracy_1_1923.pdf Futurist Manifesto, reproduced in ''Futurist Aristocracy'', New York, April 1923]&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon joined by the painters [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Giacomo Balla]], [[Gino Severini]] and the composer [[Luigi Russolo]]. Marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old, especially political and artistic tradition. "We want no part of it, the past", he wrote, "we the young and strong ''Futurists!''"  The Futurists admired [[speed]], [[technology]], youth and [[violence]], the car, the airplane and the industrial city, all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over [[nature]], and they were passionate nationalists. They repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation, praised originality, "however daring, however violent", bore proudly "the smear of madness", dismissed art critics as useless, rebelled against harmony and good taste, swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art, and gloried in science.

Publishing manifestos was a feature of Futurism, and the Futurists (usually led or prompted by Marinetti) wrote them on many topics, including painting, architecture, religion, clothing and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;Umbro Apollonio (ed.), ''Futurist Manifestos'', MFA Publications, 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-87846-627-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme, which the Futurists attempted to create in their subsequent ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting'' (1914).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/imanifestidelfut00mariuoft I Manifesti del futurismo, lanciati da Marinetti, et al, 1914] (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;  This committed them to a "universal dynamism", which was to be directly represented in painting.  Objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings:  "The sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one, ten four three; they are motionless and they change places.  ...  The motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes, and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it."&lt;ref name=Tech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/techpaint.html |title=Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting |publisher=Unknown.nu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Futurist painters were slow to develop a distinctive style and subject matter. In 1910 and 1911 they used the techniques of [[Divisionism]], breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes, which had been originally created by [[Giovanni Segantini]] and others.  Later, Severini, who lived in Paris, attributed their backwardness in style and method at this time to their distance from Paris, the centre of avant-garde art.&lt;ref&gt;Severini, G., ''The Life of a Painter'', Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-691-04419-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severini was the first to come into contact with [[Cubism]] and following a visit to Paris in 1911 the Futurist painters adopted the methods of the Cubists.  Cubism offered them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism.

[[File:Umberto Boccioni 001.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Umberto Boccioni]], sketch of ''[[The City Rises]]'' (1910)]]
They often painted modern urban scenes.  Carrà's ''[[The Funeral of the Anarchist Galli|Funeral of the Anarchist Galli]]'' (1910–11) is a large canvas representing events that the artist had himself been involved in, in 1904.  The action of a police attack and riot is rendered energetically with diagonals and broken planes.  His ''Leaving the Theatre'' (1910–11) uses a Divisionist technique to render isolated and faceless figures trudging home at night under street lights.

Boccioni's [[The City Rises (Boccioni)|''The City Rises'']]  (1910) represents scenes of construction and manual labour with a huge, rearing red horse in the centre foreground, which workmen struggle to control.  His ''States of Mind'', in three large panels, ''The Farewell'', ''Those who Go'', and ''Those Who Stay'', "made his first great statement of Futurist painting, bringing his interests in [[Bergson]], Cubism and the individual's complex experience of the modern world together in what has been described as one of the 'minor masterpieces' of early twentieth century painting."&lt;ref name=Humphreys&gt;Humphreys, R. ''Futurism'', Tate Gallery, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  The work attempts to convey feelings and sensations experienced in time, using new means of expression, including "lines of force", which were intended to convey the directional tendencies of objects through space, "simultaneity", which combined memories, present impressions and anticipation of future events, and "emotional ambience" in which the artist seeks by intuition to link sympathies between the exterior scene and interior emotion.&lt;ref name=Humphreys/&gt;

Boccioni's intentions in art were strongly influenced by the ideas of Bergson, including the idea of [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuition]], which Bergson defined as a simple, indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it.  The Futurists aimed through their art thus to enable the viewer to apprehend the inner being of what they depicted.  Boccioni developed these ideas at length in his book, ''Pittura scultura Futuriste: Dinamismo plastico'' (''Futurist Painting Sculpture: Plastic Dynamism'') (1914).&lt;ref&gt;For detailed discussions of Boccioni's debt to Bergson, see Petrie, Brian, "Boccioni and Bergson", ''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 116, No.852, March 1974, pp.140-147, and Antliff, Mark "The Fourth Dimension and Futurism: A Politicized Space", ''The Art Bulletin'', December 2000, pp.720-733.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giacomo Balla, 1912, Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash, oil on canvas, 89.8 x 109.8 cm, Albright-Knox Art Gallery.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giacomo Balla]], 1912, ''[[Dinamismo di un Cane al Guinzaglio]]'' (''Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash''), [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]]]]
Balla's ''Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash'' (1912) exemplifies the Futurists' insistence that the perceived world is in constant movement.  The painting depicts a dog whose legs, tail and leash&amp;nbsp;—and the feet of the woman walking it&amp;nbsp;—have been multiplied to a blur of movement.  It illustrates the precepts of the ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting'' that, "On account of the persistency of an image upon the retina, moving objects constantly multiply themselves; their form changes like rapid vibrations, in their mad career.  Thus a running horse has not four legs, but twenty, and their movements are triangular."&lt;ref name=Tech/&gt;  His ''Rhythm of the Bow'' (1912) similarly depicts the movements of a violinist's hand and instrument, rendered in rapid strokes within a triangular frame.

The adoption of Cubism determined the style of much subsequent Futurist painting, which Boccioni and Severini in particular continued to render in the broken colors and short brush-strokes of divisionism.  But Futurist painting differed in both subject matter and treatment from the quiet and static Cubism of [[Picasso]], [[Braque]] and [[Juan Gris|Gris]]. Although there were Futurist portraits (e.g. Carrà's  ''Woman with Absinthe'' (1911),  Severini's ''Self-Portrait'' (1912), and Boccioni's  ''Matter'' (1912)), it was the urban scene and vehicles in motion that typified Futurist painting—e.g. Boccioni's ''[[The Street Enters the House]]'' (1911), Severini's ''Dynamic Hieroglyph of the Bal Tabarin'' (1912), and Russolo's ''Automobile at Speed'' (1913)

In 1912 and 1913, Boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his Futurist ideas.  In ''[[Unique Forms of Continuity in Space]]'' (1913) he attempted to realise the relationship between the object and its environment, which was central to his theory of "dynamism".  The sculpture represents a striding figure, cast in bronze posthumously and exhibited in the [[Tate Modern]]. (It now appears on the national side of [[Italian euro coins|Italian 20 eurocent coins]]). He explored the theme further in ''Synthesis of Human Dynamism'' (1912), ''Speeding Muscles'' (1913) and ''Spiral Expansion of Speeding Muscles'' (1913).  His ideas on sculpture were published in the ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/techsculpt.html |title=Technical Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture |publisher=Unknown.nu |date=1910-04-11 |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1915 Balla also turned to sculpture making abstract "reconstructions", which were created out of various materials, were apparently moveable and even made noises.  He said that, after making twenty pictures in which he had studied the velocity of automobiles, he understood that "the single plane of the canvas did not permit the suggestion of the dynamic volume of speed in depth ... I felt the need to construct the first dynamic plastic complex with iron wires, cardboard planes, cloth and tissue paper, etc."&lt;ref name=MartinM&gt;Martin, Marianne W. ''Futurist Art and Theory'', Hacker Art Books, New York, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, personal quarrels and artistic differences between the Milan group, around Marinetti, Boccioni, and Balla, and the Florence group, around Carrà, [[Ardengo Soffici]] (1879–1964) and [[Giovanni Papini]] (1881–1956), created a rift in Italian Futurism.  The Florence group resented the dominance of Marinetti and Boccioni, whom they accused of trying to establish "an immobile church with an infallible creed", and each group dismissed the other as ''passéiste.''

Futurism had from the outset admired violence and was intensely patriotic.  The ''Futurist Manifesto'' had declared, "We will glorify war&amp;nbsp;—the world's only hygiene&amp;nbsp;—militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman."&lt;ref name="Futurist Aristocracy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/manifesto.html |title=The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism |publisher=Unknown.nu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to radical political movements, it was not much involved in politics until the autumn of 1913.&lt;ref name=MartinM/&gt;  Then, fearing the re-election of [[Giovanni Giolitti|Giolitti]], Marinetti published a political manifesto.  In 1914 the Futurists began to campaign actively against the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], which still controlled some Italian territories, and Italian neutrality between the major powers. In September, Boccioni, seated in the balcony of the Teatro dal Verme in Milan, tore up an Austrian flag and threw it into the audience, while Marinetti waved an Italian flag.  When Italy entered the [[First World War]] in 1915, many Futurists enlisted.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Jerry, "Back to the Future", The New Yorker, September 6, 2004, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of the war marked several Futurists, particularly Marinetti, who fought in the mountains of Trentino at the border of Italy and Austria-Hungary, actively engaging in propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = 'The Futurist mountains': Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's experiences of mountain combat in the First World War|journal = Modern Italy|date = 2013-11-01|issn = 1353-2944|pages = 323–338|volume = 18|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/13532944.2013.806289|first = Selena|last = Daly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combat experience also influenced Futurist music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Futurist War Noises: Confronting and Coping with the First World War|url = http://escholarship.org/uc/item/8fx1p115#page-1|website = California Italian Studies|accessdate = 2015-09-13|last = Daly|first = Selena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outbreak of war disguised the fact that Italian Futurism had come to an end. The Florence group had formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the movement by the end of 1914.  Boccioni produced only one war picture and was killed in 1916.  Severini painted some significant war pictures in 1915 (e.g. ''War'', ''Armored Train'', and ''Red Cross Train''), but in Paris turned towards Cubism and post-war was associated with the [[Return to Order]].

After the war, Marinetti revived the movement.  This revival was called ''il secondo Futurismo'' (Second Futurism) by writers in the 1960s.  The art historian [[Giovanni Lista]] has classified Futurism by decades: "Plastic Dynamism" for the first decade, "Mechanical Art" for the 1920s, "Aeroaesthetics" for the 1930s.

==Russian Futurism==
{{main|Russian Futurism|Cubo-Futurism}}
[[File:Cyclist (Goncharova, 1913).jpg|thumb|[[Natalia Goncharova]], ''Cyclist'', 1913]]
Russian Futurism was a movement of literature and the visual arts. The poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] was a prominent member of the movement. Visual artists such as [[David Burlyuk]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Natalia Goncharova]] and [[Kazimir Malevich]] found inspiration in the imagery of Futurist writings and were poets themselves. It has also a larger impact on the all [[suprematism]] movement. Other poets adopting Futurism included [[Velimir Khlebnikov]] and [[Aleksey Kruchenykh]]. Poets and painters collaborated on theatre production such as the Futurist opera ''[[Victory Over the Sun]]'', with texts by Kruchenykh and sets by Malevich.

The main style of painting was [[Cubo-Futurism]], adopted in 1913 when [[Aristarkh Lentulov]] returned from Paris and exhibited his paintings in Moscow.  Cubo-Futurism combines the forms of [[Cubism]] with the representation of movement.  Like their Italian predecessors the Russian Futurists were fascinated with dynamism, speed and the restlessness of modern urban life.

The Russian Futurists sought controversy by repudiating the art of the past, saying that [[Pushkin]] and [[Dostoevsky]] should be "heaved overboard from the steamship of modernity". They acknowledged no authority and professed not to owe anything even to Marinetti, whose principles they had earlier adopted, obstructing him when he came to Russia to proselytize in 1914.

The movement began to decline after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolution of 1917]]. Some Futurists died, others emigrated. Mayakovsky and Malevich became part of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] establishment and the [[Agitprop]] movement of the 1920s. Khlebnikov and others were persecuted. Mayakovsky committed suicide on April 14, 1930.

[[File:Casa Sant'Elia.jpg|thumb|An example of [[Futurist architecture]] by [[Antonio Sant'Elia]]]]

==Architecture==
{{further|Futurist architecture}}
The Futurist architect [[Antonio Sant'Elia]] expressed his ideas of modernity in his drawings for ''La Città Nuova'' (The New City) (1912–1914).  This project was never built and Sant'Elia was killed in the First World War, but his ideas influenced later generations of architects and artists.  The city was a backdrop onto which the dynamism of Futurist life is projected.  The city had replaced the landscape as the setting for the exciting modern life.  Sant'Elia aimed to create a city as an efficient, fast-paced machine.  He manipulates light and shape to emphasize the sculptural quality of his projects. Baroque curves and encrustations had been stripped away to reveal the essential lines of forms unprecedented from their simplicity.  In the new city, every aspect of life was to be rationalized and centralized into one great powerhouse of energy.  The city was not meant to last, and each subsequent generation was expected to build their own city rather than inheriting the architecture of the past.

Futurist architects were sometimes at odds with the Fascist state's tendency towards [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]]-classical aesthetic patterns. Nevertheless, several Futurist buildings were built in the years 1920–1940, including public buildings such as railway stations, maritime resorts and [[post office]]s.  Examples of Futurist buildings still in use today are [[Trento]]'s railway station, built by [[Angiolo Mazzoni]], and the [[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Santa Maria Novella station]] in [[Florence]].  The Florence station was designed in 1932 by the ''Gruppo Toscano'' (Tuscan Group) of architects, which included [[Giovanni Michelucci]] and [[Italo Gamberini]], with contributions by Mazzoni.

==Music==
{{main|Futurism (music)}}
Futurist music rejected tradition and introduced experimental sounds inspired by machinery, and would influence several 20th-century composers.

[[Francesco Balilla Pratella]] joined the Futurist movement in 1910 and wrote a ''Manifesto of Futurist Musicians'' in which he appealed to the young (as had Marinetti), because only they could understand what he had to say. According to Pratella, Italian music was inferior to music abroad. He praised the "sublime genius" of [[Wagner]] and saw some value in the work of other contemporary composers, for example [[Richard Strauss]], [[Elgar]], [[Mussorgsky]], and [[Sibelius]]. By contrast, the Italian [[symphony]] was dominated by [[opera]] in an "absurd and anti-musical form". The [[College or university school of music|conservatories]] was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity. The publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the "rickety and vulgar" operas of [[Puccini]] and [[Umberto Giordano]]. The only Italian Pratella could praise was his teacher [[Pietro Mascagni]], because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera, but even Mascagni was too traditional for Pratella's tastes. In the face of this mediocrity and conservatism, Pratella unfurled "the red flag of Futurism, calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight, minds to conceive, and brows free of cowardice."

[[Luigi Russolo]] (1885–1947) wrote ''[[The Art of Noises]]'' (1913),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Russolo |first=Luigi |url=http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/117 |title=The Art of Noises on Theremin Vox |publisher=Thereminvox.com |date=2004-02-22 |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607122724/http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/117 |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/futurist/art_of_noise.html The Art of Noises] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094533/http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/futurist/art_of_noise.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an influential text in 20th-century musical aesthetics. Russolo used instruments he called ''[[intonarumori]]'', which were [[Musical acoustics|acoustic]] [[noise]] generators that permitted the performer to create and control the [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of several different types of noises. Russolo and Marinetti gave the first concert of Futurist music, complete with ''intonarumori'', in 1914. However they were prevented from performing in many major European cities by the outbreak of war.

Futurism was one of several 20th-century movements in art music that paid homage to, included or imitated machines. [[Ferruccio Busoni]] has been seen as anticipating some Futurist ideas, though he remained wedded to tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubu.com/papers/lombardi.html |title=Daniele Lombardi in ''Futurism and Musical Notes'' |publisher=Ubu.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Russolo's ''intonarumori'' influenced [[Stravinsky]], [[Arthur Honegger]], [[George Antheil]], [[Edgar Varèse]],&lt;ref name="Humphreys"/&gt; [[Stockhausen]] and [[John Cage]]. In [[Pacific 231]], Honegger imitated the sound of a steam locomotive. There are also Futurist elements in [[Prokofiev]]'s ''The Steel Step'' and in his Second Symphony.

Most notable in this respect, however, is the American [[George Antheil]]. His fascination with machinery is evident in his ''Airplane Sonata'', ''Death of the Machines'', and the 30-minute ''[[Ballet Mécanique]]''. The ''Ballet Mécanique'' was originally intended to accompany an experimental film by [[Fernand Léger]], but the musical score is twice the length of the film and now stands alone. The score calls for a percussion ensemble consisting of three [[xylophones]], four bass drums, a tam-tam, three airplane propellers, seven electric bells, a siren, two "live pianists", and sixteen synchronized player pianos. Antheil's piece was the first to synchronize machines with human players and to exploit the difference between what machines and humans can play.

Other composers offered more melodic variants of Futurist music, notably [[Franco Casavola]], who was active with the movement at the invitation of Marinetti between 1924 and 1927, and [[Arthur-Vincent Lourié]], the first Russian Futurist musician, and a signatory of the St Petersburg Futurist Manifesto in 1914. His five ''Synthèses'' offer a form of dodecaphony, while ''Formes en l'air'' was dedicated to Picasso and is a Cubo-Futurist concept. Born in Ukraine and raised in New York, [[Leo Ornstein]] gave his first recital of 'Futurist Music' at the Steinway Hall in London on 27 March 1914. According to the [[Daily Sketch]] newspaper ''"one listened with considerable distress. Nothing so horrible as Mr Ornstein's music has been heard so far. Sufferers from complete deafness should attend the next recital."''

==Dance==
The Futuristic movement also influenced the concept of dance. Indeed, dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing man's ultimate fusion with the machine.  The altitude of a flying plane, the power of a car's motor and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of man's intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise. This type of dance is considered futuristic since it disrupts the referential system of traditional, classical dance and introduces a different style, new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience.  The dancer no longer performs a story, a clear content, that can be read according to the rules of ballet. One of the most famous futuristic dancers was the Italian {{Ill|Giannina Censi|it}}. Trained as a classical ballerina, she is known for her "Aerodanze" and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions. She describes this innovative form of dance as the result of a deep collaboration with Marinetti and his poetry. Through these words, she explains: " I launched this idea of the aerial-futurist poetry with Marinetti, he himself declaiming the poetry. A small stage of a few square meters;... I made myself a satin costume with a helmet; everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body. It flew and, moreover, it gave the impression of these wings that trembled, of the apparatus that trembled,... And the face had to express what the pilot felt."&lt;ref&gt;Klöck, A.

Futurism as a literary movement made its official debut with F.T. Marinetti's ''[[Futurist Manifesto|Manifesto of Futurism]]'' (1909), as it delineated the various ideals Futurist poetry should strive for. Poetry, the predominate medium of Futurist literature, can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyper-conciseness (not to be confused with the actual length of the poem).  The Futurists called their style of poetry ''parole in libertà'' (word autonomy) in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern. In this way, the Futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation, and metrics that allowed for free expression.

Theater also has an important place within the Futurist universe. Works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long, have an emphasis on nonsensical humor, and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques.
There are a number of examples of Futurist novels from both the initial period of Futurism and the neo-Futurist period, from Marinetti himself to a number of lesser known Futurists, such as  Primo Conti, Ardengo Soffici and Giordano Bruno Sanzin (''Zig Zag, Il Romanzo Futurista'' edited by Alessandro Masi, 1995). They are very diverse in style, with very little recourse to the characteristics of Futurist Poetry, such as 'parole in libertà'. Arnaldo Ginna's 'Le ''locomotive con le calze'''(Trains with socks on)plunges into a world of absurd nonsense, childishly crude. His brother Bruno Corra wrote in ''Sam Dunn è morto'' (Sam Dunn is Dead) a masterpiece of Futurist fiction, in a genre he himself called 'Synthetic' characterized by compression, and precision; it is a sophisticated piece that rises above the other novels through the strength and pervasiveness of its irony.

==1920s and 1930s==
[[File:Joseph Stella, 1919-20, Brooklyn Bridge, oil on canvas, 215.3 x 194.6 cm, Yale University Art Gallery.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Stella]], 1919-20, ''Brooklyn Bridge'', oil on canvas, 215.3 x 194.6 cm, [[Yale University Art Gallery]]]]
[[File:Blast2.jpg|thumb|The cover of the last edition of ''[[BLAST (magazine)|BLAST]]'', the [[literary magazine]] of the British [[Vorticist]] movement, a movement heavily influenced by Futurism]]
Many Italian Futurists supported [[Fascism]] in the hope of modernizing a country divided between the industrialising north and the rural, archaic South. Like the Fascists, the Futurists were Italian nationalists, radicals, admirers of violence, and were opposed to parliamentary democracy. Marinetti founded the Futurist Political Party (''Partito Politico Futurista'') in early 1918, which was absorbed into [[Benito Mussolini]]'s ''[[Fasci di combattimento]]'' in 1919, making Marinetti one of the first members of the [[National Fascist Party]]. He opposed Fascism's later exaltation of existing institutions, calling them "reactionary", and walked out of the 1920 Fascist party congress in disgust, withdrawing from politics for three years; but he supported Italian Fascism until his death in 1944. The Futurists' association with Fascism after its triumph in 1922 brought them official acceptance in Italy and the ability to carry out important work, especially in [[architecture]]. After the [[Second World War]], many Futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime.

Marinetti sought to make Futurism the official state art of Fascist Italy but failed to do so.  Mussolini chose to give patronage to numerous styles and movements in order to keep artists loyal to the regime. Opening the exhibition of art by the [[Novecento Italiano]] group in 1923, he said, "I declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art.  Art belongs to the domain of the individual.  The state has only one duty: not to undermine art, to provide humane conditions for artists, to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Braun, Emily, ''Mario Sironi and Italian Modernism: Art and Politics under Fascism'', Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Mussolini's mistress, [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who was as able a cultural entrepreneur as Marinetti, successfully promoted the rival Novecento group, and even persuaded Marinetti to sit on its board.  Although in the early years of Italian Fascism modern art was tolerated and even embraced, towards the end of the 1930s, right-wing Fascists introduced the concept of "[[degenerate art]]" from Germany to Italy and condemned Futurism.

Marinetti made numerous moves to ingratiate himself with the regime, becoming less radical and avant-garde with each.  He moved from Milan to Rome to be nearer the centre of things.  He became an academician despite his condemnation of academies, married despite his condemnation of marriage, promoted religious art after the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 and even reconciled himself to the Catholic Church, declaring that Jesus was a Futurist.

[[File:Arnaldo Dell'Ira (1903-1943), lampada a grattacielo, 1929.jpg|thumb|An example of Futurist design: "Skyscraper Lamp", by the Italian architect [[Arnaldo dell'Ira]], 1929]]
Although Futurism mostly became identified with Fascism, it had leftist and anti-Fascist supporters.  They tended to oppose Marinetti's artistic and political direction of the movement, and in 1924 the socialists, communists and anarchists walked out of the Milan Futurist Congress. The anti-Fascist voices in Futurism were not completely silenced until the annexation of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] and the Italo-German [[Pact of Steel]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Berghaus, Günther, "New Research on Futurism and its Relations with the Fascist Regime", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', 2007, Vol. 42, p.152&lt;/ref&gt;  This association of Fascists, socialists and anarchists in the Futurist movement, which may seem odd today, can be understood in terms of the influence of [[Georges Sorel]], whose ideas about the regenerative effect of political violence had adherents right across the political spectrum.

Futurism expanded to encompass many artistic domains and ultimately included painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, theatre design, textiles, drama, literature, music and architecture.

===Aeropainting===
{{main|Aeropittura}}
Aeropainting (''aeropittura'') was a major expression of the second generation of Futurism beginning in 1926.  The technology and excitement of flight, directly experienced by most aeropainters,&lt;ref name=Osborn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://simultaneita.net/tulliocrali.html |title=Osborn, Bob, ''Tullio Crali: the Ultimate Futurist Aeropainter'' |publisher=Simultaneita.net |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207090815/http://www.simultaneita.net/tulliocrali.html |archivedate=2010-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; offered aeroplanes and [[aerial landscape art|aerial landscape]] as new subject matter.  Aeropainting was varied in subject matter and treatment, including realism (especially in works of propaganda), abstraction, dynamism, quiet Umbrian landscapes,&lt;ref&gt;" ... dal realismo esasperato e compiaciuto (in particolare delle opere propagandistiche) alle forme asatratte (come in Dottori: ''Trittico della velocità''), dal dinamismo alle quieti lontane dei paesaggi umbri di Dottori ... ." ''L'aeropittura futurista'' http://users.libero.it/macbusc/id22.htm&lt;/ref&gt; portraits of Mussolini (e.g. Dottori's ''Portrait of il Duce''), devotional religious paintings, decorative art, and pictures of planes.

Aeropainting was launched in a manifesto of 1929, ''Perspectives of Flight'', signed by [[Benedetta]], [[Depero]], [[Gerardo Dottori|Dottori]], [[Fillìa]], Marinetti, [[Enrico Prampolini|Prampolini]], [[Somenzi]] and [[:it:Tato (Guglielmo Sansoni)|Tato (Guglielmo Sansoni)]]. The artists stated that  "The changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective" and that "Painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything." Crispolti identifies three main "positions" in aeropainting: "a vision of cosmic projection, at its most typical in Prampolini's 'cosmic idealism'  ... ; a 'reverie' of aerial fantasies sometimes verging on fairy-tale (for example in Dottori ...); and a kind of aeronautical documentarism that comes dizzyingly close to direct celebration of machinery (particularly in [[Tullio Crali|Crali]], but also in Tato and Ambrosi)."&lt;ref&gt;Crispolti, E., "Aeropainting", in Hulten, P., ''Futurism and Futurisms'', Thames and Hudson, 1986, p.413&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually there were over a hundred aeropainters.  Major figures include [[Fortunato Depero]], [[Enrico Prampolini]], [[Gerardo Dottori]] and Crali. Crali continued to produce ''aeropittura'' up until the 1980s.

==Legacy==
Futurism influenced many other twentieth-century art movements, including [[Art Deco]], [[Vorticism]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Dada]], and much later [[Neo-Futurism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hal Foster, Neo-Futurism. Published by: Architectural Association School of Architecture https://www.jstor.org/stable/29543561&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pinkus, ''Self-Representation in NeoFuturism and Punk''. Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press https://www.jstor.org/stable/3190376&lt;/ref&gt; Futurism as a coherent and organized artistic movement is now regarded as extinct, having died out in 1944 with the death of its leader Marinetti.

Nonetheless, the ideals of Futurism remain as significant components of modern [[Western culture]]; the emphasis on youth, speed, power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture. [[Ridley Scott]] consciously evoked the designs of [[Antonio Sant'Elia|Sant'Elia]] in ''[[Blade Runner]]''. Echoes of Marinetti's thought, especially his "dreamt-of metallization of the human body", are still strongly prevalent in Japanese culture, and surface in [[manga]]/[[anime]] and the works of artists such as [[Shinya Tsukamoto]], director of the ''Tetsuo'' (lit. "Ironman") films. Futurism has produced several reactions, including the literary genre of [[cyberpunk]]—in which technology was often treated with a critical eye—whilst artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the [[Internet]], such as [[Stelarc]] and [[Mariko Mori]], produce work which comments on Futurist ideals. and the art and architecture movement Neo-Futurism in which technology is considered a driver to a better quality of life and sustainability values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/architecture/all/18509/facts.yes_is_more_an_archicomic_on_architectural_evolution.htm Yes is More.

A revival of sorts of the Futurist movement in theatre began in 1988 with the creation of the [[Neo-Futurist]] style in Chicago, which utilizes Futurism's focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre. Currently, there are active Neo-Futurist troupes in [[Chicago]], [[New York City|New York]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/neofuturists-tml-twenty-five-years-history-anniversary/Content?oid=11871597 |title=Too Much Light at 25: An oral history |last1=Potter |first1=Janet |date=16 December 2013 |website=Reader |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Futurist ideas have been discerned in Western dance music since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1367-at-club-to-club-festival-dance-musics-growing-embrace-of-futurism-reigns/ At Club to Club Festival, Dance Music’s Growing Embrace of Futurism Reigns]&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese Composer [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]]'s 1986 album 'Futurista' was inspired by the movement. It features a speech from Tommaso Marinetti in the track 'Variety Show'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muzines.co.uk/articles/stranger-in-a-strange-world/1043 Ryuichi Sakamoto interview published ''Music Technology Magazine'' in August 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Italian director [[Marco Bellocchio]] included Futurist art in his feature film ''[[Vincere]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MoMA {{!}} Finding The Robot|url = http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2014/02/06/finding-the-robot|website = www.moma.org|accessdate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] featured the exhibition "Italian Futurism, 1909–1944: Reconstructing the Universe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://exhibitions.guggenheim.org/futurism/ "Italian Futurism, 1909–1944: Reconstructing the Universe", Solomon R.

[[File:Hexadecimal Clock by Nystrom.jpg|thumb|right|256px|Nystrom's "Tonal Watch, or Clock-dial".  ''Note the use of his invented digits for [[hexadecimal|hex]] values 9-F''.  Also note that midnight (hour 0) is at the bottom, rather than the top of the clockface.]]
[[File:Florencetime.jpg|right|256px|thumb|A hexadecimal clock-face]]
'''Hexadecimal time''' is the representation of the [[time]] of [[day]] as a [[hexadecimal]] [[Real number|number]] in the [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0,1).

The day is divided into 10&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; (16&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) hexadecimal hours, each hour into 100&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; (256&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) hexadecimal minutes, and each minute into 10&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; (16&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) hexadecimal seconds.

==History==
Hexadecimal time may have been used during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (7th – 10th centuries) in China.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

This time format was proposed by the Swedish-American engineer [[John W. Nystrom]] in 1863 as part of his [[tonal system]].

In 1997, the American Mark Vincent Rogers of [[Intuitor]] proposed a similar system of hexadecimal time and implemented it in [[JavaScript]] as the Hexclock.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==The system of Rogers==
A day is unity, or '''1''', and any fraction thereof can be shown with digits to the right of the hexadecimal [[Radix point|separator]].  So the day begins at midnight with '''.0000''' and one hexadecimal second after midnight is '''.0001'''.  Noon is '''.8000''' (one half), one hexadecimal second before was '''.7FFF''' and one hexadecimal second before next midnight will be '''.FFFF'''.

Intuitor-hextime may also be formatted with an underscore separating hexadecimal hours, minutes and seconds. For example:

'''''Ignorantia juris non excusat'''''&lt;ref name=BLD672&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 5th Edition, pg. 672&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''ignorantia legis neminem excusat'''''&lt;ref name=BLD673&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 5th Edition, pg. 673&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Latin]] for "[[ignorance]] of the [[law]] excuses not"&lt;ref name=BLD672/&gt; and "ignorance of law excuses no one"&lt;ref name=BLD673/&gt; respectively)  is a legal principle holding that a person who is unaware of a law may not escape [[legal liability|liability]] for violating that law merely because one was unaware of its content. 

European-law countries with a tradition of Roman law may also use an expression from [[Aristotle]] translated into Latin: '''''nemo censetur ignorare legem''''' (nobody is thought to be ignorant of the law) or '''''ignorantia iuris nocet''''' (not knowing the law is harmful).

==Explanation==
{{see also|Promulgation|Promulgation (canon law)}}
The rationale of the doctrine is that if ignorance were an excuse, a person charged with [[criminal offense]]s or a subject of a civil [[lawsuit]] would merely claim that one was unaware of the law in question to avoid liability, even if that person really does know what the law in question is. Thus, the law [[imputation (law)|imputes]] knowledge of all laws to all persons within the [[jurisdiction]] no matter how transiently. Even though it would be impossible, even for someone with substantial legal training, to be aware of every law in operation in every aspect of a [[Jurisdiction (area)|state's]] activities, this is the price paid to ensure that [[willful blindness]] cannot become the basis of [[exculpatory|exculpation]]. Thus, it is well settled that persons engaged in any undertakings outside what is common for a normal person, such as running a [[nuclear power plant]], will make themselves aware of the laws necessary to engage in that undertaking. If they do not, they cannot complain if they incur liability.

The doctrine assumes that the law in question has been properly promulgated—published and distributed, for example, by being printed in a [[government gazette]], made available over the [[internet]], or printed in volumes available for sale to the public at affordable prices. In the ancient phrase of [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]], ''Leges instituuntur cum promulgantur'' ("[[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Laws]] are instituted when they are promulgated").&lt;ref&gt;[[Gratian]], [[Decretum Gratiani|''Decretum'']], Distinctio 4, dictum post c.3&lt;/ref&gt; In order that a law obtain the binding force which is proper to a law, it must be applied to the men who have to be ruled by it. Such application is made by their being given notice by promulgation. A law can bind only when it is reasonably possible for those to whom it applies to acquire knowledge of it in order to observe it, even if actual knowledge of the law is absent for a particular individual. A secret law is no law at all.

In [[criminal law]], although ignorance may not clear a defendant of [[guilt (law)|guilt]], it can be a consideration in [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]], particularly where the law is unclear or the defendant sought advice from law enforcement or regulatory officials. For example, in one [[Canada|Canadian]] case, a person was charged with being in possession of [[gambling]] devices after they had been advised by [[customs]] officials that it was legal to import such devices into Canada.&lt;ref&gt;R v Potter (1978), 39 CCC (2d) 538, 3 CR (3d) 154 (PEISC).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the defendant was convicted, the sentence was an [[absolute discharge]].

In addition, there were, particularly in the days before [[satellite]] communication and [[cellular phones]], persons who could genuinely be ignorant of the law due to distance or isolation. For example, in a case in [[British Columbia]], a pair of hunters were [[acquitted]] of game offenses where the law was changed during the period they were in the wilderness hunting.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} In reaching this decision, the court refused to follow an early [[English law]] case in which a seaman on a [[clipper]] before the [[invention of radio]] was convicted even though the law had been changed while he was at sea (Bailey (1800) Russ &amp; Ry 1).

== In literature == 
The doctrine,"Ignorance of the law is no excuse," first shows up in the Bible in Leviticus 5:17: "If a person sins and does what is forbidden in any of the LORD's commands, even though he does not know it, he is guilty and will be held responsible."  An alternate explanation of the origin of the maxim, though not particularly relevant to the modern context, can be found in the philosophy of the Greeks and Romans. Such were cultures heavily influenced by customary legal systems. Within such a system, law is learned as a person participates in the culture and customs of the community. Thus it is unreasonable to believe a person could have avoided learning them. These rules and customs were also interwoven with ethical and religious dialogue so that laws expressed what is right and that which is not.  We find that [[Cicero]] wrote the following in ''[[De re publica]]'' (On the Republic):

"There is a true law, right reason, agreeable to nature, known to all men, constant and eternal, which calls to duty by its precepts, deters from evil by its prohibition.  This law cannot be departed from without guilt.  Nor is there one law at Rome and another at Athens, one thing now and another afterward; but the same law, unchanging and eternal, binds all races of man and all times."

[[Minos (dialogue)|Minos]] (attributed to [[Plato]]) states the following conversation between [[Socrates]] and his companion:

;Socrates
:Come then, do you consider just things to be unjust and unjust things just, or just things to be just and unjust things unjust?

;Companion
:I consider just things to be just, and unjust things unjust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DMinos%3Asection%3D315e Plat. Minos 315e]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Socrates
:And are they so considered among all men elsewhere as they are here?

;Companion
:Yes.
.
.
.
;Socrates
:Are things that weigh more considered heavier here, and things that weigh less lighter, or the contrary?

;Companion
:No, those that weigh more are considered heavier, and those that weigh less lighter.

;Socrates
:And is it so in Carthage also, and in Lycaea?

;Companion
:Yes.

;Socrates
:Noble things, it would seem, are everywhere considered noble&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DMinos%3Asection%3D316a Plat. Minos 316a]&lt;/ref&gt;, and base things base; not base things noble or noble things base.

;Companion
:That is so.

==Translation==
'''Presumed knowledge of the law''' is the principle in [[jurisprudence]] that one is bound by a law even if one does not know of it. It has also been defined as the "prohibition of ignorance of the law".

The concept comes from [[Roman law]], and is expressed in the [[Brocard (law)|brocard]] ''ignorantia legis non excusat''.

The essential public character of a law requires that the law, once properly promulgated, must apply to anyone in the [[jurisdiction]] where the law applies. Thus, no one can justify his conduct on the grounds that he was not aware of the law.

Generally, a convention exists by which the laws are issued and rendered accessible by methods, authors and means that are simple and well known: the law is readable in certain places (some systems prescribe that a collection of the laws is copied in every local city council), is made by certain authorities (usually sovereign, government, parliament, and derivative bodies), and enters into effect in certain ways (many systems for instance prescribe a certain number of days - often 15 - after issue). This is commonly intended as a [[constitutional law|constitutional]] regulation, and in fact many [[constitution]]s or [[statute]]s exactly describe the correct procedures.

However, some recent interpretations weaken this concept.  Particularly in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], regard can be had to the difficulty of being informed of the existence of a law considering the lifestyle of the average citizen. On the penal side, the quality of the knowledge of the law can affect the evaluation of the [[animus nocendi]] or the [[mens rea]], in that certain subjective conditions can weaken personal responsibility.

The theme was widely discussed, also for political reasons, at the time of [[the Enlightenment]] and in the 18th century, given the heavy proportion of illiterate citizens in European countries (who would have some difficulties being aware of all the laws in a country). It was then argued that both the presumed knowledge and the heavily increasing corpus of national legislation were working in favour of lawyers rather than citizens.

In recent times, some authors have considered this concept as an extension of (or at least as analogous to) the other ancient concept (typical of [[criminal law]]) that no one can be punished under a law that was issued after the action was committed (non-retroactivity of the law. See [[ex post facto]]). This interpretation is however disputed, given that the matter would hierarchically more properly refer to a constitutional doctrine rather than to a civil or penal one.

Some modern criminal statutes contain language such as stipulating that the act must be done "knowingly and wittingly" or "with unlawful intent," or some similar language. However, this does not refer to ignorance of laws, but having [[Intention (criminal law)|criminal intent]].

==Statutory law==
This principle is also stated in [[statute]]s:

*Brazil: Decree 2848 as changed by law 7209.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/Del2848compilado.htm Decree 2848 (compiled)], part of [[Brazilian Criminal Code]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Canada: [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], section 19&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-7.html#docCont Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-34, s 19].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Philippines: [[Civil Code of the Philippines|Republic Act No. 386 "Civil Code of the Philippines"]], Article 3&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1949/06/18/republic-act-no-386/|title=Republic Act No. 386 {{!}} GOVPH|work=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions==

In some jurisdictions, there are exceptions to the general rule that ignorance of the law is not a valid defense. For example, under U.S. Federal criminal tax law, the element of ''willfulness'' required by the provisions of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] has been ruled by the courts to correspond to a "voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty" under which an "actual good faith belief based on a misunderstanding caused by the complexity of the tax law" is a valid legal defense. See [[Cheek v. United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Jon Strauss, "Nonpayment of Taxes: When Ignorance of the Law Is an Excuse," 25 ''Akron Law Review'' 611 (Winter/Spring 1992), at [https://uakron.edu/dotAsset/4ea43a5b-7873-49cb-afc4-c37f776fd6f2.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark C. Winings, "Ignorance Is Bliss Especially for the Tax Evader," 84 ''Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology'' 575, 582 (Northwestern Univ. School of Law, Fall 1993), at [http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6786&amp;context=jclc].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven R. Toscher, Dennis L. Perez, Charles P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8037">The '''illusion of transparency''' is a tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which their personal mental state is known by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shatz|first=Itamar|title=The Illusion of Transparency: Why You Are Not As Obvious As You Think You Are|url=https://effectiviology.com/illusion-of-transparency/|website=Effectiviology|accessdate=11 November 2017|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another manifestation of the illusion of transparency (sometimes called the observer's illusion of transparency) is a tendency for people to overestimate how well they understand others' personal mental states. This [[cognitive bias]] is similar to the [[illusion of asymmetric insight]].

==Experimental support==
For her PhD dissertation in psychology at [[Stanford University]], Elizabeth Newton created a simple test that she regarded as an illustration of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Jovel |last1=Ong |first2=Christian |last2=Chao |url=https://www.cscollege.gov.sg/Knowledge/Odyssey/Facilitating%20Team%20Effectiveness/Pages/The%20Science%20of%20Effective%20Team%20Discussions.aspx |title=The Science of Effective Team Discussions |publisher=Civil Service College, Singapore |date=April 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She would tap out a well-known song, such as "Happy Birthday" or the national anthem, with her finger and have the test subject guess the song. People usually estimate that the song will be guessed correctly in about 50&amp;nbsp;percent of the tests, but only 3&amp;nbsp;percent pick the correct song. The tapper can hear every note and the lyrics in his or her head; however, the observer, with no access to what the tapper is thinking, only hears a rhythmic tapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McRaney|first=David|title=The Illusion of Transparency|url=http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/07/14/the-illusion-of-transparency/|website=You Are Not So Smart |accessdate=20 July 2011|date=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public speaking and stage fright==
The illusion of transparency is commonly prominent in public speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland, C. (2016). Student oral presentations: developing the skills and reducing the apprehension. In: Proceedings of 10th International Technology, Education and Development
Conference Valencia, Spain. 7–9 March. IATED, Valencia, Spain, pp. 1474-1483. doi:10.21125/inted.2016.1317 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/297715071_Student_oral_presentations_developing_the_skills_and_reducing_the_apprehension&lt;/ref&gt;  It may be increased by the [[spotlight effect]]. The speaker has an exaggerated sense of how obvious his or her nervousness about a speech is to the audience. Studies have shown that when the audience is surveyed, the speaker's emotions were not nearly so evident to the crowd as the speaker perceived them to be.&lt;ref name=Speech&gt;{{cite journal|title=The illusion of transparency and the alleviation of speech anxiety |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |date=2003 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=618–625 |url=http://www.psych.cornell.edu/sec/pubPeople/tdg1/Savitsky%26Gilovich.03.pdf |doi=10.1016/s0022-1031(03)00056-8 |last1=Savitsky |first1=Kenneth |last2=Gilovich |first2=Thomas |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313180510/http://www.psych.cornell.edu/sec/pubPeople/tdg1/Savitsky%26Gilovich.03.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial anxiety in a public speaking situation can cause stress that, because of the illusion of transparency, the speaker may feel is evident to the listeners. This mistaken perception can cause the speaker to compensate, which he or she then feels is even more obvious to the crowd, and the stress increases in a feedback loop. Awareness of the limits of others' perceptions of one's mental state can help break the cycle and reduce speech anxiety.&lt;ref name=Speech/&gt;

===Studies on public speaking and the illusion of transparency===
Kenneth Savitsky and Thomas Gilovich performed two experiments on public speaking anxiety in relation to the illusion of transparency. The first focused on the speaker's perception of his or her anxiety levels versus an observer's perception of the speaker's anxiety levels. The results were as expected: the speaker judged himself or herself more harshly than the observer did.&lt;ref name=Speech/&gt;

In their second study, Savitsky and Gilovich focused on the connection between the illusion of transparency and the exacerbation of speech anxiety. Participants in this study were divided into three groups: control, reassured, and informed. All were given a topic and had five minutes to prepare a speech in front of a crowd, after which they rated themselves on anxiety, speech quality, and appearance, and observers also rated them on anxiety levels and speech quality. The control group were given no other advance instructions. The reassured and informed groups were both told in advance that it is normal to feel anxiety about giving a speech. The reassured group were told that research indicates they should not worry about this. The informed group were told about the illusion of transparency and that research indicates that emotions are usually not as evident to others as people believe they are. The informed group rated themselves higher in every respect and were also rated higher by the observers. The informed group, understanding that the audience would not be able to perceive their nervousness, had less stress and their speech tended to be better.&lt;ref name=Speech/&gt;

==The bystander effect==
Thomas Gilovich, Kenneth Savitsky, and Victoria Husted Medvec believe that this phenomenon is partially the reason for the [[bystander effect]]. They found that concern or alarm were not as apparent to observers as the individual experiencing them thought, and that people believed they would be able to read others' expressions better than they actually could.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Illusion of Transparency: Biased Assessments of Others' Ability to Read One's Emotional States |url=http://www.psych.cornell.edu/sec/pubPeople/tdg1/Gilo.Sav.Medvec.pdf |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=1998 |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=332–346 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.75.2.332 |pmid=9731312 |last1=Gilovich |first1=Thomas |last2=Savitsky |first2=Kenneth |last3=Medvec |first3=Victoria Husted |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313180517/http://www.psych.cornell.edu/sec/pubPeople/tdg1/Gilo.Sav.Medvec.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=When confronted with a potential emergency, people typically play it cool, adopt a look of nonchalance, and monitor the reactions of others to determine if a crisis is really at hand. No one wants to overreact, after all, if it might not be a true emergency.

==Work==

Aranda's complex body of work exists outside the boundaries of the object, and is characterized by the struggle of catching sight of elusive concepts such as time, circulation, and imagination. Her installations and temporary projects, which often examine social interactions and the role that the circulation of objects plays in the cycles of production and consumption, are intensely site-specific.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Much of her work takes up the concept of time, sometimes to consider alternative notions of the temporal experience, and other times to approach the arbitrariness of time and freedom from time.

===You had no ninth of May===
In ''You had no ninth of May!'' (2006), Aranda addresses the artificiality of the homogeneous construction of time through the case of [[Kirbati]], an archipelago in the Pacific that, in 1995, changed the position of the International Date Line (IDL). Through a series of installation pieces that conceptually and formally map the international date line at Kiribati, the artist investigates officially assigned time and calls into question concepts such as "today" or "tomorrow".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=49fbf1d8-1cc3-49f1-b868-3b262957a307%40sessionmgr114&amp;hid=105&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=84445864&amp;db=asu|title = The future was ceaselessly|last = Zaya|first = Octavio|date =1 December 2012|journal = Arte al Dia|doi = |pmid = |access-date =13 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===There has been a miscalculation ===
Aranda's 2007 work ''There has been a miscalculation (Flattened Ammunition)'' is an experiment on the functioning of time. This work consists in a transparent Plexiglas cube containing approximately 100 science-fiction novels with a story line taking place before 2007 (the year in which the work was first produced), which have been shredded, almost pulverized. It also contains a hidden computerized air compressor that unexpectedly and violently blows the dust around at random intervals, recalling a sudden sandstorm. This way, Aranda's work makes books endlessly circulate and swirl in an empty cube, leaving them incessantly suspended in a past future.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Intervals===
For ''Intervals'' (2009), a solo presentation of four works installed in the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], Aranda explored and inverted the notion of time as a strictly assigned linear designation marked by clocks and calendars. In this exhibition, all the works were proposed to partially describe, in the artist's words "a sense of time's passage according to subjective experience, rather than subscribed to a strict system of measurement that assigns a fixed duration to any given event".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each piece captures time's passage in an individualized sense, addressing what the artist conceives as "subject formation" and the assertion of one's dominion over one's own time as a condition for individualism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==E-Flux==
Julieta Aranda has been actively collaborating on [[e-flux]] since 2003, which is a publishing platform, archive, artist project, curatorial platform, and cultural enterprise founded by [[Anton Vidokle]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.e-flux.com/about/|title = e-flux: about|date = |accessdate =1 December 2015|website = e-flux.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aranda is both a contributor and editor of e-flux journal, and in collaboration with Vidokle, has produced several e-flux art projects that explore unusual models for the circulation and distribution of art.

===E-flux video rental ===
Conceived in 2004 in collaboration with Anton Vidokle, e-flux video rental (EVR) comprises a free VHS video rental store, a public screening room and an archive. Its collection is selected in collaboration with a large group of international curators, and consists of over 500 art films and video works that are available to the public for home viewing free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/e-flux-video-rental-3/|title = e-flux: announcements: e-flux video rental|date = |accessdate =1 December 2015|website = e-flux.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was originally presented in a storefront in New York, and has been presented at various locations around the world, with the inventory of videos continuously increasing. After seven years as a traveling project, EVR was donated to the [[Museum of Modern Art (Ljubljana)|Moderna Galerija]] in Ljubljana in 2011 for its permanent display, which is a reconstruction of the original storefront at 53 Ludlow Street, New York. As a video rental store entering a museum collection, EVR will preserve and make available for future study not only the videos that comprise it, but also the social form of video rental stores, and the technology that originally made it possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/e-flux-video-rental-found-a-home/|title = e-flux: announcements: e-flux video rental found a home|date = |accessdate =1 December 2015|website = e-flux.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pawnshop===
Released in 2007, ''Pawnshop'' is an e-flux project by artists [[Liz Linden]], Julieta Aranda, and Anton Vidokle. Both an exhibition and an artwork in itself, this project was originally located in e-flux's 53 Ludlow Street storefront, which temporarily became a pawnshop dedicated to the pawning of artworks. Its initial inventory consisted of over 60 pawned works from a group of artists invited to participate in the project, and after it was opened for business, further artists were able walk in with a work they wanted to pawn. After the initial 30 days, the artworks that have not been retrieved by their original owners became available for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/pawnshop/|title = e-flux: announcements: pawnshop|date = |accessdate =1 December 2015|website = e-flux.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time/bank===
An online platform initiated by Aranda and Vidokle, ''Time/Bank'' is based on the premise that everyone in the field of culture has something to contribute and that it is possible to develop and sustain an alternative economy by connecting existing needs with unacknowledged resources. On a practical level, it is a platform where artists, curators, writers and other people in the field, can exchange time and skills—help each other get things done without using money. Idealistically, ''Time/Bank'' can become a place where certain types of actions and ideas, that seem to have no value in our market-driven society, can gain a sense of worth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.artandeducation.net/announcement/timebank/|title = art and education|date = |accessdate =1 December 2015|website = artandeducation.net|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/timebank/|title = e-flux: timebank|date = |accessdate=1 December 2015|website = e-flux.com|publisher = |author1=Aranda, Julieta  |author2=Vidokle, Anton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to open a time bank account at http://www.e-flux.com/timebank/user/register

===Supercommunity===
[[SUPERCOMMUNITY]] is an editorial project by e-flux journal commissioned for the 56th [[Venice Biennale]], which was run from May to August 2015. Julieta Aranda, Anton Vidokle, and [[Brian Kuan Wood]] have been co-editors of this project, which addresses e-flux journal and its readership as the supercommunity and presents a daily piece of writing that often adopts the form of poetry, short fiction or screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/e-flux-journal-at-the-56th-venice-biennale/|title = e-flux: announcements: e-flux journal at the 56th venice biennale|date = |accessdate =1 December 2015|website = e-flux.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has featured contributions from nearly one hundred authors such as anthropologists, artists, philosophers, poets, theorists and writers.

==Awards and recognition==
Aranda has been awarded numerous grants and merit scholarships, from institutions such as [[FONCA]], the National Foundation for the Culture and the Arts in Mexico (1995–1996), and both the School of Visual Arts (1995–1999), the [[National Board of Review]] (1996–1999) and Columbia University (2004) in New York.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She has also been an artist in residence at UNIDEE, the International Program by Fondazione Pistoletto in [[Biella]], Italy (2006), as well as at IAPSIS, the International Artists Studio Program in Stockholm (2006) and at the International Residence of Recollets in Paris (2008).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her work has been shown in internationally renowned institutions such as the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami]] (2009); the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York (2009); the [[National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design]], Oslo (2010); and [[Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Castilla y León]], Spain (2010), as well as at international art festivals such as the [[Liverpool Biennial]] (2010); the Kassel [[Documenta]], Germany (2012); and the [[Shanghai Biennale]] (2012).

'''Just in sequence''' ('''JIS''') is an inventory strategy that matches [[Just in time (business)|just in time]] (JIT) and complete fit in sequence with variation of assembly line production. Components and parts arrive at a production line right in time as scheduled before they get assembled. Feedback from the manufacturing line is used to coordinate transportation to and from the process area. When implemented successfully, JIS improves a company's [[Return on assets|return on assets (ROA)]], without loss in flexibility, quality or overall efficiency. JIS is mainly implemented with automobile manufacturing.

JIS is sometimes called '''in-line vehicle sequencing''' ('''ILVS''').

== Just In Sequence is Just In Time ==
Just in Sequence (JIS) is just one specialised strategy to achieve [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] (JIT). The process concept of JIT sees buffers at the production line as waste in capital bound. The aim is to eliminate buffers as much as possible at expense of stability when disturbances arise. Just In Sequence is one of the most extreme applications of the concept, where components arrive Just In Time and sequenced for consumption.

The sequencing allows companies to eliminate supply buffers as soon as the quantity in component part buffers necessary is reduced to a minimum. If not sequencing according to scheduled variety of production, all required components must be stocked in buffers. For flexible production lines, such as a modern automotive assembly line, the variety is an option to produce directly on customer orders. As soon as the next order arrives at the work center, the scheduler distributes the supply orders inline with the production sequence of the final production line.

=== Displacement of buffers upwards to suppliers ===

However, with JIS the buffer quantities are displaced upward in material flow to the components suppliers. It is a misinterpretation of JIS to assume that all buffers will be eliminated. Hence just the cost for buffer inventory becomes re-allocated to the producers of the supplies. Sequencing eliminates buffers in the final assembly line by consolidating all similar components into distributed and sequenced buffers, which partly reside on the paths of transportation to final assembly. This strategy thus reduces the line-side inventory buffer. However, the effect is worse when the sequence does not get correctly scheduled upwards or when the transportation line gets congested.

=== Introduction of JIS concepts ===

Just In Sequence processes are typically implemented only after the company has achieved a high degree of competency on Just In Time processes. The first step for the organization is to implement JIT processes to synchronize all manufacturing and material departments inside the plant and to collaborate with suppliers, customers, and sub-contractors to reduce inventory buffers to within a few hours. This process typically uncovers deep manufacturing and logistic issues that are not easy to overcome (see [[Just In Time (business)#Implementation|JIT Implementation]] for more details). The manufacturing company can only benefit from sequencing items once these problems have been resolved successfully and components are delivered Just In Time.

Sequencing can be implemented in a Just In Time supply operation at many levels, bringing ever-higher inventory reduction and financial benefits:

| Items are built according to the sequence in which they will be required by the customer or downstream departments
| Reduces the amount of finished goods or semi-finished goods in inventory, freeing up additional cash, and reducing carrying costs
|}

== Implementing JIS concepts ==

Just In Sequence implementations introduce a number of new process requirements on top of Just In Time practices. A production sequence or final assembly sequence must be shared upwards to suppliers and sub-contractors. Feedback to customers must be organized according to the scheduled output to earn all positive financial effects. For these and other reasons, the actual production sequence must be "broadcast" out to all relevant parties once it is firm. This "broadcast" can be done over the phone, paper, email, or other automated IT system. [[EDIFACT|UN/EDIFACT]] supports an [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]] message standard called [http://search.unece.org/cgi-bin/query?keys=DELJIT&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 DELJIT] as one standardized way to communicate this information.

Once the sequence is broadcast, each party must immediately take action to deliver sequenced parts in time. In many cases the turn-around time from broadcast to final assembly is less than 2 hours, with some components required in 30 minutes or less. With this time frame, there is little room for errors. In addition, quality inspection and [[poka-yoke]] must be implemented in the sequencing step to guarantee that the sequenced components match the assembly sequence perfectly. In many cases, suppliers must manage periodic sequence reversals, for example, when loading racks into a truck, since the first rack into the truck is the last one to come out. Employees and systems must also properly manage exceptional scenarios, such as re-processing damaged items after initial sequencing, skipping slots for scrapped items, etc. Just In Sequence implementations can only be successful if all of these processes are implemented correctly and all people involved understand what is at stake.

=== Limitations ===
In many manufacturing operations, the actual production sequence cannot be planned ahead of time with enough certainty to enable sequencing. The main reason is that some manufacturing processes require re-work frequently so that a scheduled sequence becomes irrelevant. For example, painting operations in an automotive plant can have re-work levels of up to 20% (USA, Southern Europe).

The '''Kinetic Simulation Algorithm Ontology''' (KiSAO) supplies information about existing algorithms available for the simulation of [[systems biology]] models, their characterization and interrelationships. KiSAO is part of the [[BioModels.net]] project and of the [[COMBINE]] initiative.&lt;ref name="10.1038/msb.2011.77" /&gt;

==Structure==
KiSAO consists of three main branches:
* simulation algorithm,
* simulation algorithm characteristic,
* simulation algorithm parameter.
The elements of each algorithm branch are linked to characteristic and parameter branches using ''has characteristic'' and ''has parameter'' relationships accordingly.The algorithm branch itself is hierarchically structured using ''subClassOf'' relationships, which denote that the descendant algorithms were derived from, or specify, more general ancestors.

'''Kyriarchy''', pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|aɪ|ɹ|i|ɑɹ|k|i}}, is in [[feminist theory]], a [[social system]] or set of connecting social systems built around [[Domination (sociology)|domination]], [[oppression]], and [[submission]]. The word was coined by [[Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza]] in 1992 to describe her theory of interconnected, interacting, and self-extending systems of domination and submission, in which a single individual might be oppressed in some relationships and [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileged]] in others. It is an [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] extension of the idea of [[patriarchy]] beyond gender.&lt;ref name="kwok"&gt;{{cite journal |title = Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza and Postcolonial Studies |author = Kwok Pui-lan | author-link = Kwok Pui-lan |year = 2009 |journal = Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion |volume = 25 |issue = 1 |pages = 191–197 |publisher = Indiana University Press |jstor =10.2979/fsr.2009.25.1.191  |doi=10.2979/fsr.2009.25.1.191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyriarchy encompasses [[sexism]], [[racism]], [[speciesism]], [[homophobia]], [[classism]], [[economic justice|economic injustice]], [[colonialism]], [[militarism]], [[ethnocentrism]], [[anthropocentrism]], and other forms of dominating hierarchies in which the subordination of one person or group to another is internalized and institutionalized.{{r|teraudkalns}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Her Master's Tools?: Feminist And Postcolonial Engagements of Historical-critical Discourse|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RO9YnY2xKaQC|publisher = BRILL|date = 2005|isbn = 9004130527|language = en|first = Caroline Vander|last = Stichele|first2 = Todd C.|last2 = Penner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term was coined by Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza&lt;ref name="fiorenza_2001"&gt;{{cite book |title = Wisdom Ways: Introducing Feminist Biblical Interpretation |chapter = Glossary |last = Schüssler Fiorenza |first = Elisabeth |authorlink = Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza |publisher = Orbis Books |location = New York |year = 2001 |chapterurl = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dku%2Frios |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ufDNBgAAQBAJ |isbn=1608332527}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992 when she published her book ''But She Said: Feminist Practices of Biblical Interpretation''.&lt;ref name="fiorenza_2009"&gt;{{cite book |title = Prejudice and Christian beginnings: investigating race, gender, and ethnicity in early Christian studies |chapter = Introduction: Exploring the Intersections of Race, Gender, Status and Ethnicity in Early Christian Studies |last = Schüssler Fiorenza |first = Elisabeth |authorlink = Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza |editor1-last  = Nasrallah |editor1-first = Laura |editor2-last = Schüssler Fiorenza |editor2-first = Elisabeth |publisher = Fortress Press |location = Minneapolis |year = 2009 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u7XoAi3VfOEC |isbn=1451412843}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from {{lang-el|κύριος, [[kyrios]]}}, "lord, master" and {{lang-el|ἄρχω, archō}}, "to lead, rule, govern".&lt;ref name=fiorenza_2009 /&gt;{{r|teraudkalns}} The word "kyriarchy" ({{lang-el|κυριαρχία, kyriarchia}}, a valid Greek formation, though it is not found in ancient Greek) can now be used to mean "[[sovereignty]]", i.e. the rulership of a sovereign.

== Usage ==
The term was originally developed in the context of feminist theological discourse, and has been used in some other areas of academia as a non-gender based descriptor of systems of power, as opposed to [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Susana|title=Close Kin and Distant Relatives: The Paradox of Respectability in Black Women's Literature|date=February 4, 2014|publisher=University of Virginia Press|isbn=0813935512|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXWjAQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=kyriarchy&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also widely used outside of scholarly contexts.&lt;ref name=osborne&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Osborne|first1=Natalie|title=Intersectionality and kyriarchy: A framework for approaching power and social justice in planning and climate change adaptation|journal=Planning Theory|date=2015|volume=14|issue=2|page=132|doi=10.1177/1473095213516443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural positions==
Schüssler Fiorenza describes interdependent "stratifications of gender, race, class, religion, [[heterosexism|heterosexualism]], and age" as ''structural positions'' assigned at birth. She suggests that people inhabit several positions, and that positions with privilege become nodal points through which other positions are experienced. For example, in a context where gender is the primary privileged position (e.g., [[patriarchy]]), gender becomes the nodal point through which sexuality, race, and class are experienced. In a context where class is the primary privileged position (i.e., [[classism]]), gender and race are experienced through class dynamics. Fiorenza stresses that kyriarchy is not a hierarchical system as it does not focus on one point of domination. Instead it is described as a "complex pyramidal system" with those on the bottom of the pyramid experiencing the "full power of kyriarchal oppression". The kyriarchy is recognized as the [[status quo]] and therefore its oppressive structures may not be recognized.&lt;ref name=fiorenza_2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="reed-bouley" /&gt;

To maintain this system, kyriarchy relies on the creation of a servant class, race, gender, or people. The position of this class is reinforced through "education, socialization, and brute violence and [[malestream]] rationalization".&lt;ref name=fiorenza_2009 /&gt; Tēraudkalns suggests that these structures of oppression are self-sustained by [[internalized oppression]]; those with relative power tend to remain in power, while those without tend to remain disenfranchised.&lt;ref name="teraudkalns"&gt;{{cite book |title = Religion and political change in Europe: past and present |chapter = Construction of Masculinities in Contemporary Christianity |pages = 223–232 |last = Tēraudkalns |first = Valdis |editor-last = Cimdiņa |editor-first = Ausma |publisher = PLUS |year = 2003 |isbn=8884921414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structures of oppression also amplify and feed into each other.&lt;ref name="reed-bouley"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Antiracist Theological Education as a Site of Struggle for Justice|last = Reed-Bouley|first = Jennifer|date = Spring 2012|journal = Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion|doi = 10.2979/jfemistudreli.28.1.178|volume=28|pages=178–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14008">'''Lean Higher Education''' (LHE) refers to the adaptation of [[lean thinking]] to higher education, typically with the goal of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of operations. Lean, originally developed at the [[Toyota Motor Corporation]], is a management philosophy that emphasizes "respect for people" and "continuous improvement" as core tenets. Lean encourages employees at all organizational levels to re-imagine services from a customer's point of view, removing process steps that do not add value and emphasizing steps that add the most value. While the concept of "customers" and "products" is controversial in higher education settings, there are certainly diverse stakeholders who are interested in the success of colleges and universities, the most common of which are students, faculty, administrators, potential employers and various levels of government.

Lean in higher education has been applied both to administrative and academic services. Balzer&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Higher-Education-William-Balzer/dp/1439814651] ''Lean Higher Education: Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes''&lt;/ref&gt; (2010) described such initiatives within university settings, including the critical factors for success and ways to measure progress. He noted that LHE can be effective to  respond to higher education's heightened expectations, reducing expenses in an era of rising costs, meeting demands of public accountability, and leveraging institutional resources to fulfill the educational, scholarship, and outreach missions of higher education. A comprehensive literature review examining Lean's impact on higher education has been published.&lt;ref&gt;Balzer, W.K., Francis, D., Krehbiel, T. &amp; Shea, N. (2016). A review and perspective on Lean in higher education. Quality Assurance in Education. 24(4). http://hdl.handle.net/2374.MIA/5995&lt;/ref&gt; The authors reported that Lean has a significant and measurable impact when used to improve academic and administrative operations. Such improvements are effective at the department/unit level or throughout an entire institution. However, the authors noted that implementing Lean is a serious undertaking that is most impactful if it involves long-term, strategic planning.

Though the application of Lean management in higher education is more prevalent in administrative processes (e.g., admissions, registration, HR, and procurement) it also has been applied to academic processes (e.g., course design and teaching,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=839748&amp;show=abstract M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2004) "Improving Business School Courses by Applying Lean Principles and Practices,"]&lt;/ref&gt; improving degree programs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1464406&amp;show=abstract M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2005) "Using Kaizen to Improve Graduate Business School Degree Programs,"]&lt;/ref&gt; student feedback,&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.napier.ac.uk/services/PI/sustainable-futures/Documents/RIEStudent%20Feedback_Briefing_050110_01.pdf Edinburgh Napier University "SUSTAINABLE FUTURES BRIEFING: RAPID IMPROVEMENT EVENT (RIE) – Student Feedback (Business School)"]&lt;/ref&gt; and handling of assignments) in an increasing number of cases.

Pioneering academic institutions who have implemented Lean include: [[Cardiff University]] (Wales), [http://www.napier.ac.uk/about/management/sustainable-futures/Pages/Sustainable-Futures.aspx Edinburgh Napier University] (Scotland), [http://www.mtu.edu/improvement/ Michigan Technological University] (USA), [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (USA), [http://www.abdn.ac.uk/staffnet/governance/business-improvement-1228.php University of Aberdeen] (Scotland), [[University of Central Oklahoma]] (USA), [http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/lean/ University of St. Andrews] (Scotland), [[Winona State University]] (USA) and others. A group of universities in the U.K. have formed LeanHEHub [http://www.leanhehub.ac.uk/]. In Scotland, the [https://www.linkedin.com/groups/Scottish-Higher-Education-Improvement-Network-4913702/about Scottish Higher Education Improvement Network] (SHEIN)  is a collaborative network of HE professionals working within the area of continuous improvement. SHEIN exists to encourage the sharing of resources and best practice, online and face-to-face.

==Lean Principles==

Of great importance in the application of Lean management in any organization is the recognition and daily practice of the Lean principles: "Continuous Improvement" and "Respect for People." The "Respect for People" principle is challenging for management to implement, because most managers have risen to their level of responsibility based on their superior "fire-fighting" skills. With Lean, managers are coaches who guide their employees through a problem solving process. The employee learns how to ask themselves the questions that enable them to solve problems on their own, with the same or better quality that the manager would have achieved. Problems occur when managers cannot relinquish control, resulting in zero-sum (win-lose) outcomes for people and inferior results. In other words, one party gains at another party's expense, and the losers are much less willing to participate in continuous improvement. This outcome impedes teamwork and information flows, and discourages daily efforts by administration, faculty, and staff to improve processes. In order to function properly, Lean management must be understood and practiced in a plus-sum (win-win) manner. The "Respect for People" principle is required in order to sustain continuous improvement [http://leanprofessor.com/blog/2013/12/19/lean-must-do-no-harm/].

==Lean Practices==

The origins of Lean practices date from late 19th- and early 20th-century industrial engineering. Lean practices have evolved over the decades since then to become much easier for non-specialists to understand and use. It is now common for people with backgrounds and interests far from industrial engineering to become highly competent Lean management practitioners. Therefore, the Lean management system has the benefit that everyone in an organization can apply the practices without the need for specialists.

Seminal work in the application of Lean to academic processes was done by Prof. M.L. "Bob" Emiliani&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccsu.edu/page.cfm?p=6554&amp;viewdirid=151778&amp; Prof. M.L. "Bob" Emiliani's faculty home page] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140413184757/http://www.ccsu.edu/page.cfm?p=6554&amp;viewdirid=151778&amp; |date=2014-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was at Rensselaer Polytechnic University in the early 2000s and is described in two papers: M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2004) "Improving Business School Courses by Applying Lean Principles and Practices,"&lt;ref&gt;M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2004) "Improving Business School Courses by Applying Lean Principles and Practices" [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=839748&amp;show=abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; and M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2005) "Using Kaizen to Improve Graduate Business School Degree Programs,".&lt;ref&gt;M.L. "Bob" Emiliani (2005) "Using Kaizen to Improve Graduate Business School Degree Programs" [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1464406&amp;show=abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; The former paper describes what individual faculty can do to improve their courses and delivery using Lean principles and practices. The latter paper describes what teams of faculty, staff, administrators, students, alumni, and employers can do to improve their courses using [[kaizen]] (literal translation: "change for the better"). Prof. Emiliani also produced a Kaizen Team Leader's Manual for improving academic courses and programs based on his work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leanprofessor.com/blog/resources/ Bob Emiliani, "Improving Higher Education" (2009), unpublished work]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of Lean practices in academic processes are described in two papers written by Prof. Emiliani cited above (Refs. 2,3), and in the book ''Lean Higher Education: Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Higher-Education-William-Balzer/dp/1439814651] ''Lean Higher Education: Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences Between Lean in Higher Education and Lean in Other Sectors==

Lean in HE follows the same principles and practices of [[Lean management]] as applied in service, manufacturing, or government sectors. Lean management readily takes into account the unique governance structures of higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asq.org/edu/2009/06/baldrige-national-quality-program/how-to-launch-lean-in-a-university.pdf Alisa Salewski (2009) "How to Launch Lean in a University", ASQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Lean management is responsive to the needs of multiple stakeholders in a non-zero-sum fashion and is therefore well-suited for the governance and ongoing improvement of HEIs.

The business of teaching in, or the back office administration of, Higher Education Institutions (HEI's) is similar to Lean management practiced in other service sectors because teaching and administration consist of repeatable transactional processes, in whole or part. Guidance for Lean implementation in HE administration, and, to a lesser extent in teaching, is presented in the book ''Lean Higher Education, Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes''.&lt;ref&gt;William K. Balzer (2010) ''Lean Higher Education, Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes'', Productivity Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of Lean in Higher Education==

The impact of Lean in HE (namely in academic activities), have been studied and found to be potentially beneficial. The benefits include lead-time reduction, increase in throughput, lower cost, increased student satisfaction scores, etc. Reports analyzing Lean in higher education indicate that Lean principles are being successfully applied.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://standrewslean.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/83/2016/10/Tobias-Langer-Dissertation.pdf Tobias Langer(2011) "The Application of Lean thinking for Improving Processes in Higher Education Institutions; Evidence from three UK case studies", Queens University Belfast]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Y.R. Parasmal, (2009) "Application of Lean Thinking in Higher Education", Strategum Consulting, India [http://www.strategum.in/component/option,com_ionfiles/fileid,13/func,download/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zoe Radnor &amp; Giovanni Bucci (2011) "Analysis of Lean Implementation in UK Business Schools and Universities", Association of Business Schools [http://www.wbs.ac.uk/downloads/news/2011/03/abs-lean-report-exec-summary-march-2011-13008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Various HE stakeholders will likely perceive their organization to be substantially different or possess unique characteristics compared to other service organizations or businesses using Lean management. These reports, as well as a wide range of empirical results, show such perceptions to be erroneous.

==Criticisms of Lean Management==

The principal criticisms of Lean management are well known, relatively few in number, and have been constant over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leanprofessor.com/2014/03/05/six-criticisms-lean/ Emiliani (2014) "Same Six Criticisms of Lean"]&lt;/ref&gt; Workers may view Lean management as undesirable if it is incorrectly implemented, because it could make them work harder, they might have less time to spend with customers, and, ultimately, they could lose their jobs. These criticisms, which will surely be voiced by faculty and staff in HE, are predictable &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leanprofessor.com/2013/12/19/lean-must-do-no-harm/ Emiliani (2013) "Lean Must Do No Harm"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the result of zero-sum (win-lose) application of Lean management by senior managers.

Supporters of Lean might assert that Lean management can be conducted in a non-zero-sum (win-win) manner—the criticism is simply a result of misapplication of the central concepts.

{{Tort law}}

'''Malicious prosecution''' is a [[common law]] intentional [[tort]], while like the tort of [[abuse of process]],  its elements include (1) intentionally (and [[Malice (law)|maliciously]]) instituting and pursuing (or causing to be instituted or pursued) a legal action ([[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[Criminal law|criminal]]) that is (2) brought without [[probable cause]] and (3) dismissed in favor of the victim of the malicious prosecution.  In some jurisdictions, the term "malicious prosecution" denotes the wrongful initiation of criminal proceedings, while the term "malicious use of process" denotes the wrongful initiation of civil proceedings.

Criminal prosecuting attorneys and judges are protected from tort liability for malicious prosecution by doctrines of prosecutorial immunity and judicial immunity. Moreover, the mere filing of a complaint cannot constitute an abuse of process. The parties who have abused or misused the process have gone beyond merely filing a lawsuit. The taking of an appeal, even a frivolous one, is not enough to constitute an abuse of process. The mere filing or maintenance of a lawsuit, even for an improper purpose, is not a proper basis for an abuse of process action.

Declining to expand the tort of malicious prosecution, a unanimous California Supreme Court in the case of ''Sheldon Appel Co. v. Albert &amp; Oliker'', 47 Cal. 3d 863, 873 (1989) observed: "While the filing of [[frivolous lawsuit]]s is certainly improper and cannot in any way be condoned, in our view the better means of addressing the problem of unjustified litigation is through the adoption of measures facilitating the speedy resolution of the initial lawsuit and authorizing the imposition of sanctions for frivolous or delaying conduct within that first action itself, rather than through an expansion of the opportunities for initiating one or more additional rounds of malicious prosecution litigation after the first action has been concluded."&lt;ref&gt;Per the case of ''Lossing v. Superior Court'' (1989) 207 Cal. App. 3d 635, 638-640[255 Cal. Rptr. 18]; see also Tellefsen v. Key System Transit Lines, supra, 198 Cal.App.2d at p. 615 [Court of Appeal has remedies for frivolous appeals]; Green v. Uccelli (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1112, 1122-1123 [255 Cal.Rptr. 315]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The tort originates in the (now defunct) legal maxim that "the King pays no costs"; that is, [[The Crown]] could not be forced to pay the legal costs of a person it prosecuted, even if that person was found innocent. As ''[[The London Magazine]]'' stated in 1766: "if a groundless and vexatious prosecution be commenced in the King's name, his ministers who commenced, or advised commencing that prosecution, ought at least to be obliged to pay the costs which an innocent subject has thereby been put to".

==U.S. use of English Rule==
Sixteen [[U.S. state]]s require another element of malicious prosecution.{{fact|date=October 2018}}  This element, commonly called the English Rule, states that, in addition to fulfilling all other malicious prosecution elements, one must also prove injury other than the normal downside of being sued.  This rule is limited to equitable damages, such as loss of profit, and excludes damages that cannot be measured by the law (''e.g.'', damage to reputation).{{fact|date=October 2018}}

==Canadian law==
[[Law of Canada|Canadian jurisprudence]] has changed in that if any individual takes legal action that meet the above criteria, they may be sued. Legal action may be taken against the [[police]] or the [[Crown Attorney]] or the [[Attorney General#Canada|Attorney General]], as they are no longer exempt from suit.&lt;ref&gt;Nelles v. Ontario, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

The tort of malicious prosecution was recently reviewed in 2009 by the Supreme Court of Canada in ''[[Miazga v. Kvello Estate]]'', and specifically how it applied to public prosecutors in Canada. The court outlined the four required elements for the tort of malicious prosecution: (i) The prosecution must be initiated by the defendant; (ii) The prosecution must be terminated in the plaintiff's favour. (iii) There was a lack of reasonable and probable grounds to commence or continue the prosecution; and (iv) The defendant was motivated to commence or continue to the prosecution due to malice.

In 2014, the Quebec Court of Appeal held that the contents of plea bargaining negotiations held in the context of criminal cases could be admitted as evidence in the context of a civil suit for malicious prosecution, despite the general evidentiary rule prohibiting adducing settlement discussions into proof at trial. More specifically, the Court held that introducing into evidence the contents of such negotiations was possible when it tended to demonstrate that the prosecution initiated or maintained criminal charges on the basis of improper motives.&lt;ref&gt;Singh c. Montreal (City of), 2014 QCCA 307 (CanLII), &lt;http://canlii.ca/t/g36bd&gt; retrieved on 2014-11-07. Leave to Supreme Court of Canada refused on November 6th 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Notably, the tort of malicious prosecution only protects the right of defendants to be free of frivolous lawsuits brought by malicious plaintiffs.  For a variety of reasons grounded in [[Public policy doctrine|public policy]], courts have consistently refused to authorize the converse — a tort of malicious defense which would protect the right of plaintiffs to be free of frivolous defenses raised by defendants.&lt;ref&gt;''Bertero v. National General Corp.'', 13 Cal. 3d 43, 52, 529 P.2d 608, 118 Cal. Rptr. 184 (1974) (citing ''Ritter v. Ritter'', 381 Ill. 549, 46 N.E. 2d 41 (1943)).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13037">The '''marginal value theorem''' ('''MVT''') is an [[optimality model]] that usually describes the behavior of an optimally foraging individual in a system where resources (often food) are located in discrete patches separated by areas with no resources. Due to the resource-free space, animals must spend time traveling between patches. The MVT can also be applied to other situations in which organisms face [[diminishing returns]].

The MVT was first proposed by [[Eric Charnov]] in 1976. In his original formulation: "The predator should leave the patch it is presently in when the marginal capture rate in the patch drops to the average capture rate for the habitat."&lt;ref name="Charnov 1976"&gt;[[Eric Charnov|Charnov, E. L.]] 1976. Optimal foraging: the marginal value theorem. Theoretical Population Biology 9:129–136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
All animals must forage for food in order to meet their energetic needs, but doing so is energetically costly. It is assumed that evolution by natural selection results in animals utilizing the most economic and efficient strategy to balance energy gain and consumption.  The Marginal Value Theorem is an optimality model that describes the strategy that maximizes gain per unit time in systems where resources, and thus rate of returns, decrease with time.&lt;ref name="Parker 1991"&gt;Parker, G.A. “Marginal Value Theorem with Exploitation Time Costs: Diet, Sperm Reserves, and Optimal Copula Duration in Dung Flies” (1992) The American Naturalist 139(6):1237–1256&lt;/ref&gt; The model weighs benefits and costs and is used to predict giving up time and giving up density. Giving up time (GUT) is the interval of time between when the animal last feeds and when it leaves the patch. Giving up density (GUD) is the food density within a patch when the animal will choose to move on to other food patches.

When an animal is foraging in a system where food sources are patchily distributed, the MVT can be used to predict how much time an individual will spend searching for a particular patch before moving on to a new one. In general, individuals will stay longer if (1) patches are farther apart or (2) current patches are poor in resources. Both situations increase the ratio of travel cost to foraging benefit.

[[File:Marginalvaluetheorem.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The optimal time spent in a patch is given by the tangent to the resource intake curve that departs from the expected transit time value. Any other line crossing the resource intake curve has a shallower slope and thus a sub-optimal resource intake rate.]]

==Modeling==
As animals forage in patchy systems, they balance resource intake, traveling time, and foraging time. Resource intake within a patch diminishes with time, as shown by the solid curve in the graph to the right. The curve follows this pattern because resource intake is initially very fast, but slows as the resource is depleted. Traveling time is shown by the distance from the leftmost vertical dotted line to the y-axis. Optimal foraging time is modeled by connecting this point on the x-axis tangentially to the resource intake curve. Doing so maximizes the ratio between resource intake and time spent foraging and traveling.

At the extremes of the loading curve, animals spend too much time traveling for a small payoff, or they search too long in a given patch for an ineffective load. The MVT identifies the best possible intermediate between these extremes.

===Assumptions===
# The individual is assumed to control when it leaves the patch in order to maximize the ratio between resource intake and time.
# The consumer depletes the amount of resources in the patch where he/she is foraging; therefore, the rate of intake of food in that patch decreases as a function of time.
# If there is variation in the quality of patches, the MVT assumes that different patches are distributed randomly throughout the landscape.

==Examples==

===Humans===
A common illustration of the MVT is apple picking in humans. When one first arrives at a new apple tree, the number of apples picked per minute is high, but it rapidly decreases as the lowest-hanging fruits are depleted. Strategies in which too few apples are picked from each tree or where each tree is exhausted are suboptimal because they result, respectively, in time lost travelling among trees or picking the hard to find last few apples from a tree. The optimal time spent picking apples in each tree is thus a compromise between these two strategies, which can be quantitatively found using the MVT.

===Optimal foraging in great tits===
[[Great tit]]s are a species of bird found throughout Europe, northern Africa, and Asia. They are known to forage in “patchy” environments, and research has shown that their behavior can be modeled by [[Optimal foraging theory|optimal foraging models]], including the MVT. In a 1977 study by R.A. Cowie,&lt;ref name="Cowie 1977"&gt;Cowie, R. J. (1977) “Optimal foraging in great tits (Parus Major)” Nature 268:137–139&lt;/ref&gt; birds were deprived of food and then allowed to forage through patches in two different environments (the environments differed only in distance between patches). As predicted, in both cases birds spent more time in one area when the patches were farther away or yielded more benefits, regardless of the environment. In a similar experiment by Naef-Daenzer (1999),&lt;ref name="ND1999"&gt;Naef-Daenzer, Beat (1999) “Patch time allocation and patch sampling by foraging great and blue tits” Animal Behavior 59:989–999&lt;/ref&gt; great tits were shown to have a foraging efficiency 30% better than random foraging would yield. This is because great tits were specifically spending more time in resource-rich areas, as predicted by the MVT. This data supports the use of the MVT in predicting the foraging behavior of great tits.

===Feeding in hairy armadillos and guinea pigs===
Experimental evidence has shown that [[screaming hairy armadillo]]s and [[guinea pig]]s qualitatively follow MVT when foraging.&lt;ref name="Cassini 1990"&gt;Cassini, Marcelo H., Alejandro Kacelnik, and Enrique T. Segura (1990) “The tale of the screaming hairy armadillo, the guinea pig, and the marginal value theorem” Animal Behavior 39(6):1030–1050&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers ran several parallel experiments: one for each animal under consistent patch quality, and one for guinea pigs with varying patch quality. While the qualitative foraging trend was shown to follow MVT in each case, the quantitative analysis indicated that each patch was exploited further than expected.

===Plant root growth===
The MVT can be used to model foraging in plants as well as animals. Plants have been shown to preferentially place their roots, which are their foraging organs, in areas of higher resource concentration. Recall that the MVT predicts that animals will forage for longer in patches with higher resource quality. Plants increase root biomass in layers/areas of soil that are rich in nutrients and resources, and decrease root growth into areas of poor-quality soil. Thus, plants grow roots into patches of soil according to their wealth of resources in a manner consistent with the MVT.&lt;ref name="mcknickle"&gt;McNickle, Gordon G. and James F. Calhill Jr. “Plant root growth and the marginal value theorem” (2009) Proceedings of the National Academ of Sciences of the United States of America 106(12):4747–4751&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, plant roots grow more quickly through low-quality patches of soil than through high-quality patches of soil, just as foraging animals are predicted to spend less time in low-quality areas than high-quality areas.

===Copulation time in dung flies===
The MVT can be applied to situations other than foraging in which animals experience diminished returns. Consider, for example, the mating copulation duration of the [[Scathophaga stercoraria|yellow dung fly]]. In the dung fly mating system, males gather on fresh cow droppings and wait for females to arrive in smaller groups to lay their eggs. Males must compete with each other for the chance to mate with arriving females—sometimes one male will kick another male off of a female and take over mating with the female mid-copulation. In this instance, the second male fertilizes about 80% of the eggs.&lt;ref name="Parker and Stuart"&gt;Parker, G. A. and R. A. Stuart (1976) “Animal Behavior as a Strategy Optimizer: Evolution of Resource Assessment Strategies and Optimal Emigration Thresholds” The American Naturalist 110(976):1055–1076&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, after a male has mated with a female he guards her so that no other males will have the opportunity to mate with her and displace his sperm before she lays her eggs. After the female lays her eggs, the male must take the time to search for another female before he is able to copulate again.

The question, then, is how long the dung fly should spend copulating with each female. On one hand, the longer a male dung fly copulates the more eggs he can fertilize. However, the benefits of extra copulation time diminish quickly, as the male loses the chance to find another female during long copulations. The MVT predicts that the optimal copulation time is just long enough to fertilize about 80% of the eggs; after this time, the rewards are much smaller and are not worth missing out on another mate.&lt;ref name="Parker and Stuart" /&gt; This predicted value for copulation time, 40 minutes, is very close to the average observed value, 36 minutes.

In dung flies, the observed values of copulation time and time searching for another mate vary with body weight. Heavier males have shorter search times and shorter copulation times. These shorter search times are likely due to increased cost of travel with increased body weight; shorter copulation times probably reflect that it is easier for heavier males to successfully take over females mid-copulation. Additionally, researchers have taken into account “patch quality,” i.e. the quality of females arriving on the various cowpats. Research also shows that males copulate for longer with the larger females who hold more eggs and have larger reproductive tract dimensions. Thus, males change their copulation time to maximize their fitness, but they are doing so in response to selection imposed by female morphology. Even with these variations, male dung flies do exhibit close-to-optimal copulation time relative to their body size, as predicted by the MVT.&lt;ref name ="Parker et al 1999"&gt;Parker, Geoffrey A., Leigh W. Simmons, Paula Stockley, Doreen M. McChristie, and Eric L. Charnov. (1999) “Optimal copula duration in yellow dung flies: effects of female size and egg content.” Animal Behavior 57:795–805&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Many studies, such as the examples presented above, have shown good qualitative support for predictions generated by the Marginal Value Theorem. However, in some more quantitative studies, the predictions of the MVT haven’t been as successful, with the observed values substantially deviating from predictions. One proposed explanation for these deviations is that it is difficult to objectively measure payoff rates. For example, an animal in an unpredictable environment may need to spend extra time sampling, making it hard for researchers to determine foraging time.&lt;ref name="Nonacs"&gt;Nonacs, Peter. “State dependent behavior and the marginal value theorem.” (2001) Behavioral Ecology 12(1):71–83&lt;/ref&gt;
        
Beyond this imprecision, some researchers propose that there is something fundamental missing from the model. Namely, animals are probably doing more than just foraging, whether it be dealing with predation risks or searching for mating opportunities.&lt;ref name="Nonacs" /&gt; Natural selection is not the only force influencing the evolution of species. Sexual selection, for example, may alter foraging behaviors, making them less consistent with the MVT. These researchers point out that the marginal value theorem is a starting point, but complexity and nuances must be incorporated into models and tests for foraging and patch-use.

One other type of model that has been used in place of MVT in predicting foraging behavior is the state-dependent behavior model. Although state-dependent models have been viewed as a generalization of the MVT,&lt;ref name="Wajnberg et al 2000"&gt;Wajnberg Eric, Pierre Bernhard, Frederic Hamelin and Guy Boivin (2006). "Optimal patch time allocation for time-limited foragers." Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 60, 1–10&lt;/ref&gt; they are unlikely to generate broadly applicable predictions like those from the MVT because they test predictions under a specific set of conditions. While the predictions of these models must be tested under precise conditions, they might offer valuable insights not available from broader models such as MVT.&lt;ref name="Nonacs" /&gt;

'''Mobile phone tracking''' is the ascertaining of the position or location of a [[mobile phone]], whether stationary or moving. Localization may occur either via [[multilateration]] of radio signals between (several) [[cell tower]]s of the [[cellular network|network]] and the phone, or simply via [[GPS]]. To locate a mobile phone using multilateration of radio signals, it must emit at least the [[roaming]] signal to contact the next nearby antenna tower, but the process does not require an active call. The [[GSM|Global System for Mobile Communications]] (GSM) is based on the phone's [[signal strength]] to nearby antenna masts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4738219.stm|title=Tracking a suspect by any mobile phone: Tracking SIM and handset | work=BBC News | date=2005-08-03 | accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile positioning may include [[location-based service]]s that disclose the actual coordinates of a mobile phone, which is a technology used by [[telecommunication]] companies to [[approximate]] the location of a mobile phone, and thereby also its user.&lt;ref name=swang2008&gt;[http://to.swang.googlepages.com/ICC2008LBSforMobilessimplifiedR2.pdf "Location Based Services for Mobiles: Technologies and Standards“], Shu Wang, Jungwon Min and Byung K. Yi, [http://www.ieee-icc.org/ IEEE International Conference on Communication (ICC) 2008], Beijing, China&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
The technology of locating is based on measuring power levels and [[antenna pattern]]s and uses the concept that a powered mobile phone always communicates [[wireless]]ly with one of the closest [[base station]]s, so knowledge of the location of the base station implies the cell phone is nearby.

Advanced systems determine the sector in which the mobile phone is located and roughly estimate also the distance to the base station. Further approximation can be done by [[interpolating]] signals between adjacent antenna towers. Qualified services may achieve a precision of down to 50 meters in [[urban area]]s where mobile traffic and density of antenna towers (base stations) is sufficiently high.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} [[Rural]] and desolate areas may see miles between base stations and therefore determine locations less precisely.

[[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] localization uses [[multilateration]] to determine the location of GSM mobile phones, or dedicated trackers, usually with the intent to locate the user.&lt;ref name=swang2008 /&gt;

The location of a mobile phone can be determined in a number of ways:

===Network-based===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
The location of a mobile phone can be determined using the service provider's network infrastructure. The advantage of network-based techniques, from a service provider's point of view, is that they can be implemented non-intrusively without affecting handsets. Network-based techniques were developed many years prior to the widespread availability of GPS on handsets. (See {{cite patent |country=US |number=5519760 |gdate=21 May 1996}} for one of the first works relating to this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/1-5200-RD24-Mobile-positioning-using-wireless-networks.pdf Mobile Positioning Using Wireless Networks]&lt;/ref&gt;)

The accuracy of network-based techniques varies, with cell identification as the least accurate and [[triangulation]] as moderately accurate, and newer "advanced forward link [[trilateration]]" timing methods as the most accurate. The accuracy of network-based techniques is both dependent on the concentration of cell base stations, with urban environments achieving the highest possible accuracy because of the higher number of [[cell tower]]s, and the implementation of the most current timing methods.

One of the key challenges of network-based techniques is the requirement to work closely with the service provider, as it entails the installation of hardware and software within the operator's infrastructure. Frequently the compulsion associated with a legislative framework, such as [[Enhanced 9-1-1]], is required before a service provider will deploy a solution.

===Handset-based===
The location of a mobile phone can be determined using [[client software]] installed on the handset.&lt;ref&gt;Handset-based mobile phone tracking app example 1: [http://www.crystalball.tv/mobile-phone-tracking/ MobileTrack]&lt;/ref&gt; This technique determines the location of the handset by putting its location by cell identification, signal strengths of the home and neighboring cells, which is continuously sent to the carrier. In addition, if the handset is also equipped with [[GPS]] then significantly more precise location information can be then sent from the handset to the carrier.

Another approach is to use a fingerprinting-based technique,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=M.|last2=Youssef|first2=M.|date=2012-01-01|title=CellSense: An Accurate Energy-Efficient GSM Positioning System|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6062428|journal=IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology|volume=61|issue=1|pages=286–296|doi=10.1109/TVT.2011.2173771|issn=0018-9545|arxiv=1110.3425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=M.|last2=Youssef|first2=M.|date=2010-12-01|title=CellSense: A Probabilistic RSSI-Based GSM Positioning System|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5683779|journal=2010 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 2010)|pages=1–5|doi=10.1109/GLOCOM.2010.5683779|arxiv=1004.3178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=M.|last2=Youssef|first2=M.|date=2011-06-01|title=A Hidden Markov Model for Localization Using Low-End GSM Cell Phones|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5962993|journal=2011 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)|pages=1–5|doi=10.1109/icc.2011.5962993|arxiv=1010.3411}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the "signature" of the home and neighboring cells signal strengths at different points in the area of interest is recorded by [[wardriving|war-driving]] and matched in real-time to determine the handset location. This is usually performed independent from the carrier.

The key disadvantage of handset-based techniques, from service provider's point of view, is the necessity of installing software on the handset. It requires the active cooperation of the mobile subscriber as well as software that must be able to handle the different [[operating system]]s of the handsets. Typically, [[smartphone]]s, such as one based on [[Symbian]], [[Windows Mobile]], [[Windows Phone]], [[BlackBerry OS]], [[iOS]], or [[Android (operating system)|Android]], would be able to run such software, e.g. Google Maps.

One proposed work-around is the installation of [[embedded system|embedded]] hardware or software on the handset by the manufacturers, e.g., [[Enhanced Observed Time Difference]] (E-OTD). This avenue has not made significant headway, due to the difficulty of convincing different manufacturers to cooperate on a common mechanism and to address the cost issue. Another difficulty would be to address the issue of foreign handsets that are roaming in the network.

===SIM-based===
Using the [[subscriber identity module]] (SIM) in [[GSM]] and [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UMTS) handsets, it is possible to obtain raw radio measurements from the handset.&lt;ref&gt;ETSI TS 102 223 V9.1.0 SIM standard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.co.nz/article/484018/vodafone_local_zone_-_landline_your_mobile|title= Vodafone Local Zone|work= PC World|author=Ted Gibbons|date=25 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Available measurements include the serving [[Cell ID]], round-trip time, and signal strength. The type of information obtained via the SIM can differ from that which is available from the handset. For example, it may not be possible to obtain any raw measurements from the handset directly, yet still obtain measurements via the SIM.

===Wi-Fi===
[[Crowdsourcing|Crowdsourced]] Wi-Fi data can also be used to identify a handset's location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Q&amp;A on Location Data|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/04/27Apple-Q-A-on-Location-Data.html|work=apple.com|publisher=Apple|accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poor performance of the GPS-based methods in indoor environment and the increasing popularity of Wi-Fi have encouraged companies to design new and feasible methods to carry out Wi-Fi-based indoor positioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | journal=Asilomar Conference on Signal Processing 2012|url=http://ws2.binghamton.edu/fowler/Improving%20WLAN-Based%20Indoor%20Mobile%20Positioning%20Using%20Sparsity.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[smartphone]]s combine [[satellite navigation|Global Navigation Satellite System]]s (GNSS), such as [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[GLONASS]], with [[Wi-Fi positioning system]]s.

=== Hybrid ===
[[Hybrid positioning system]]s use a combination of network-based and handset-based technologies for location determination. One example would be some modes of [[Assisted GPS]], which can both use [[GPS]] and network information to compute the location. Both types of data are thus used by the telephone to make the location more accurate (i.e., A-GPS). Alternatively tracking with both systems can also occur by having the phone attain its GPS-location directly from the [[satellite]]s, and then having the information sent via the network to the person that is trying to locate the telephone. Such systems include [[Google Maps]], as well as, [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]]'s [[OTDOA]] and [[E-CellID]].

There are also hybrid positioning systems which combine several different location approaches to position mobile devices by [[Wi-Fi]], [[WiMAX]], GSM, LTE, [[IP address]]es, and network environment data.

== Operational purpose ==
In order to route calls to a phone, the [[cell site|cell towers]] listen for a signal sent from the phone and negotiate which tower is best able to communicate with the phone. As the phone changes location, the antenna towers monitor the signal, and the phone is "roamed" to an adjacent tower as appropriate. By comparing the relative signal strength from multiple antenna towers, a general location of a phone can be roughly determined. Other means make use of the antenna pattern, which supports angular determination and [[phase discrimination]].

Newer phones may also allow the tracking of the phone even when turned on and not active in a telephone call. This results from the roaming procedures that perform hand-over of the phone from one base station to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bearer interest ==
A phone's location can be uploaded to a common website where one's friends and family can view one's last reported position. Newer phones may have built-in [[Global Positioning System|GPS receivers]] which could be used in a similar fashion, but with much higher accuracy. This is controversial, because data on a common website means people who are not "friends and family" may be able to view the information.

== Privacy ==
Locating or positioning touches upon delicate [[privacy]] issues, since it enables someone to check where a person is without the person's consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Waxman |first1=Seth |title=Brief for technology companies as amici curiae in support of neither party |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/16-402-ac-technology-companies.pdf |website=scotusblog |publisher=Supreme Court of the United States |accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strict ethics and security measures are strongly recommended for services that employ positioning.&lt;br/&gt;

He described the data, which consists of 35,830 lines of data collected during the span of [[Germany]]'s [[data retention]] at the time, saying, "This is six months of my life [...] You can see where I am, when I sleep at night, what I'm doing." He partnered up with [[Die Zeit|ZEIT Online]] and made his information publicly available in an [http://www.zeit.de/datenschutz/malte-spitz-vorratsdaten interactive map] which allows users to watch his entire movements during that time in fast-forward. Spitz concluded that technology consumers are the key to challenging privacy norms in today's society who "have to fight for self determination in the digital age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/25/malte-spitzs-ted-talk-_n_1701775.html | title=Malte Spitz's TED Talk Takes On Mobile Phone Privacy Debate (VIDEO) | publisher=Huffington Post | date=25 July 2012 | accessdate=26 January 2016 | author=Fitzgerald, Britney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zeit.de/digital/datenschutz/2011-03/data-protection-malte-spitz | title=Betrayed by our own data | publisher=ZEIT | date=10 March 2011 | accessdate=26 January 2016 | author=Biermann, Kai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Carpenter v. United States]]'' that the government violates the Fourth Amendment by accessing historical records containing the physical locations of cellphones without a search warrant.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60108">'''Moral disengagement''' is a term from [[social psychology]] for the process of convincing the self that [[ethical standards]] do not apply to oneself in a particular context. This is done by separating moral reactions from inhumane conduct and disabling the mechanism of self-condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Fiske|first = Susan T.|title = Social beings : core motives in social psychology|year = 2004|publisher = J. Wiley|location = Hoboken, NJ|isbn = 0471654221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, moral disengagement involves a process of cognitive re-construing or re-framing of destructive behavior as being morally acceptable without changing the behavior or the moral standards.&lt;ref name="Bandura1999"/&gt; In [[social cognitive theory of morality]], self-regulatory mechanisms embedded in moral standards and self-sanctions translate [[moral reasoning]] into actions, and, as a result, [[moral agency]] is exerted. Thus, the moral self is situated in a broader, [[socio-cognitive]] self-theory consisting of self-organizing, proactive, self-reflective, and self-regulative mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Bandura1999"/&gt; Three major sub-functions are operating in this self-regulatory system in which moral agency is grounded. The first sub-function is self-monitoring of one's conduct, which is the initial step of taking control over it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mechanisms of moral disengagement in the exercise of moral agency|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.364|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date = 1996-01-01|volume = 71|issue = 2|pages = 364–374|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.364|first = Albert|last = Bandura|first2 = Claudio|last2 = Barbaranelli|first3 = Gian Vittorio|last3 = Caprara|first4 = Concetta|last4 = Pastorelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''"Action gives rise to self-reactions through a judgmental function in which conduct is evaluated against internal standards and situational circumstances".''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mechanisms of moral disengagement in the exercise of moral agency.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.364|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date = 1996-01-01|volume = 71|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.71.2.364|first = Albert|last = Bandura|first2 = Claudio|last2 = Barbaranelli|first3 = Gian Vittorio|last3 = Caprara|first4 = Concetta|last4 = Pastorelli|pages =364–374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, moral judgments evoke self-reactive influence. The self-reactive and judgmental mechanisms constitute the second and third sub-function.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Generally, moral standards are adopted to serve as guides for good behavior and as deterrents for bad conduct. Once internalized control has developed, people regulate their actions by the standards they apply to themselves and this give them [[self-satisfaction]] and a sense of [[self-worth]]. Individuals refrain from behaving in ways that violate their moral standards in order to avoid self-condemnation. Therefore, self-sanctions play a significant role in keeping conduct in line with these internal moral standards and hence also in regulating inhumane conduct. However, moral standards only function as fixed internal regulators of conduct when [[Self-control|self-regulatory mechanisms]] have been activated. Many different social and psychological processes prevent the activation of self-sanction. Selective activation of self-sanctions and internal moral control or disengagement allows for a wide range of behaviour, given the same moral standard.&lt;ref name="Bandura1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Moral disengagement functions in the perpetration of inhumanities through moral justification, euphemistic labelling, advantageous comparison, displacing or diffusing responsibility, disregarding or misrepresenting injurious consequences, and dehumanising the victim.&lt;ref name="Bandura1999"&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Moral Disengagement in the Perpetration of Inhumanities |url= http://psr.sagepub.com/content/3/3/193 |journal= Personality and Social Psychology Review |date=1999-08-01 |issn= 1088-8683 |pmid= 15661671 |pages=193–209 |volume=3 |issue=3 |doi= 10.1207/s15327957pspr0303_3 |first=Albert |last=Bandura}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rather than operating independently, these cognitive mechanisms are interrelated within a [[wikt:sociostructural|sociostructural]] context to promote inhumane conduct in people's daily lives.&lt;ref name="Bandura1999"/&gt;

== Mechanisms ==

=== Moral justification ===
One method of disengagement is portraying inhumane behavior as though it '''has a moral purpose''' in order to make it [[Social acceptance|socially acceptable]]. Moral justification is the first of a series of mechanisms suggested by Bandura that can induce people to bypass self-sanction and violate personal standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Moral Behavior and Development: Theory, Research, and Applications|last = Bandura|first = A.|publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year = 1991|isbn = |location = Hillsdale, NJ|pages = 45–103|editor-last = Kurtines|editor-first = W. M.|editor-last2 = Gewirtz|editor-first2 = J. L.|volume = 1|chapter = Social cognitive theory of moral thought and action}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[torture]], in order to obtain information necessary to protect the nation's citizens, may be seen as acceptable. This form of disengagement happens before the decision to engage in a [[Behavior|behaviour]], usually people only engage in reprehensible conduct after they have justified the actions on a [[Morality|moral]] ground. Through cognitive reconstrual, wrongful behaviours can be perceived as righteous.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Selective Activation and Disengagement of Moral Control|last = Bandura|first = Albert|date = 1990|journal = Journal of Social Issues|doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1990.tb00270.x|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 46|pages=27–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religious]] principles, [[nationalistic]] imperatives and righteous ideologies have long been used as means to justify reprehensible and destructive conducts. One example is the holy terror justified by religious principles documented by Rapport and Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The morality of terrorism: Religious and secular justification.|publisher = Pergamon|year = 1982|isbn = |location = Elmsford, NY|editor-last = Rapoport|editor-first = D. C.|editor-last2 = Alexander|editor-first2 = Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral justifications can be highly effective in influencing [[public opinion]], this is due to the difficulty in detecting deceptive moral claims. Literature review by Kathleen found that the difficulty arises from the following four sources. 1. People are generally susceptible to [[deception]]. 2. Political communication is usually in the form of media, which eliminates the nonverbal cues that can assist the detection of deception. 3. People become overly focused on the individual due to social judgement biases. 4. [[Politician]]s accusing each other of lying is not the norm of political culture, therefore it is not natural for the public to suspect moral claims.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1048981|title = Manipulating Public Opinion with Moral Justification|last = McGraw|first = Kathleen M.|date = 1998|journal = Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|doi = 10.1177/0002716298560001010|pmid = |volume = 560|pages = 129–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen also identified four variants of moral-claim justifications in [[politics]]. 1. Personal ethical standards. 2. Shared political values. 3. Not commonly shared values for example religion-specific principles. 4. A claim of collective benefits.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Among these variants, it is found that justifications which appeal to personal ethical standards and collective social benefits are the most effective in shaping public opinion.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = "What They Say or What They Do?" The Impact of Elite Explanation and Policy Outcomes on Public Opinion|last = McGraw|first = Kathleen M.|date = 1995|journal = American Journal of Political Science|doi = 10.2307/2111757|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Best|first2 = Samuel|last3 = Timpone|first3 = Richard|volume = 39|pages = 53–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that people with high moral principles are not exempt from moral justification, they are less likely to conform to arbitrary social demands however when their principles are violated, they are also more likely to display aggressive behaviour towards violators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Student activism, moral development, and morality|last = Keniston|first = K.|date = 1970|journal = American Journal of Orthopsychiatry|doi = 10.1111/j.1939-0025.1970.tb00716.x|pmid = 5507294|access-date = |volume = 40|issue = 4|pages = 577–592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Euphemistic labelling ===
Using [[Euphemism|euphemistic]] language to describe reprehensible conduct is another way that individuals can morally disengage from their moral standards. Language shapes individual thought forms which constitute the basis for courses of action. Activities can take on different "appearances" depending on what names are given or attached them. Euphemistic language is a means to make injurious and harmful behavior respectable and reduce responsibility for it from the person.&lt;ref name="Bandura1999"/&gt; With the help of intricate rephrasing, detrimental behaviour is made innocuous and acceptable, and people who are part of it are liberated from feeling sense of guilty. Adults are more likely to engage in aggressive conduct when the detrimental act is sanitized than when it is labelled as an aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Diener|first1 = Edward|last2 = Dineen|first2 = John|last3 = Endresen|first3 = Karen|last4 = Beaman|first4 = Arthur L.|last5 = Fraser|first5 = Scott C.|title = Effects of altered responsibility, cognitive set, and modeling on physical aggression and deindividuation|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date = 1975|volume = 31|issue = 2|pages = 328–337|doi=10.1037/h0076279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists different varieties of euphemisms. One of them is dependent on sanitizing language.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Gambino|first1 = Richard |authorlink=Richard Gambino |title = Watergate lingo: A language of non-responsibility|journal = Freedom at Issue|date = 1973|volume = 22|issue = 7–9|page = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; By disguising the deleterious with innocent wordings, the detrimental behaviour itself becomes more respectable. Soldiers "waste" people rather than kill them.&lt;ref name="The fine art of euphemism"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Safire|first1 = W.|title = The fine art of euphemism|journal = San Francisco Chronicle|date = 1979|page = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bombing missions are executed in the name of "servicing the target," and for the sake of public utility. Terrorists name themselves as "freedom fighters." The attacks are depicted as "clean, surgical strikes," and the victims are eloquently listed as "collateral damage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Hilgartner|first1 = Stephen|last2 = Bell|first2 = Richard C.|last3 = O'Connor|first3 = Rory|title = Nukespeak: Nuclear language, visions, and mindset|date = 1982|publisher = Sierra Club Books|location = San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanitizing euphemism is also commonly used in less abominable daily activities that people perform everyday. From the point of view of several government agencies, people are not laid off. Instead they are provided with a "career alternative enhancement", making it look like they are offered a job promotion. The lecturer may teach business students to rephrase lies in competitive business transactions for the sake of closing the deal as "strategic misrepresentation".&lt;ref name="The fine art of euphemism"/&gt; The nuclear power industry has its own technical set of terms of euphemisms for the detrimental effects caused by nuclear mishaps to the public. An explosion is described as an "energetic dis-assembly," and a reactor accident is labeled as a "normal aberration". Last but not least, plutonium contamination is tagged as "infiltration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1 = |title = Award-winning nuclear jargon|publisher = San Francisco Chronicle|date = 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; People working in the television industry attempt to introduce some of the most brutal television shows of human cruelty to the public with the sanitized tags of "action and adventure" programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Baldwin|first1 = Thomas F.|last2 = Lewis|first2 = Colby|title = Violence in television: The industry looks at itself|journal = Television and Social Behavior|date = 1972|volume = 1|page = 290}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acid rain which imposes destroying effects on lakes and forests has its own euphemistic label of "atmospheric deposition of anthropogenically derived acidic substances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1 = Hechinger|first1 = F. M.|title = Down with doublespeak|publisher = San Francisco Chronicle (This World section)|date = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agent-less passive style in presenting events is a second linguistic tool with the help of which people can establish the appearance that the blamable and pernicious acts stem from indescribable forces rather than people themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Bolinger|first1 = Dwight|title = Language: The loaded weapon|date = 1982|publisher = Longman|location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; People removed themselves from being the agents of their own acts. When a driver explaining to police how he managed to demolish a telephone pole, he said "The telephone pole was approaching. I was attempting to swerve out of its way, when it struck my front end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Bandura|first1 = Albert|title = Selective moral disengagement in the exercise of moral agency|journal = Journal of Moral Education|date = 2002|volume = 31|issue = 2|pages = 101–119|doi=10.1080/0305724022014322}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specialized jargons of a legitimate enterprise can even be misused under an unlawful circumstance by the outlaw to beautify their harmful behaviours.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In the [[Watergate]] vocabulary, criminal conspiracy was referred as a "game plan", and the conspirators were relabeled as "team players".

=== Advantageous comparison ===
In addition to moral justification, another mechanism that individuals can deploy to make harmful behavior seem morally acceptable is termed '''advantageous comparison'''. This process exploits the contrast principle, which follows the assumption that the [[perception]] of human conduct is influenced by what it is compared against. That is, individuals contrast their conduct with other examples of more immoral behavior and in doing this comparison their own behavior is trivialized. The more immoral the contrasting behavior is, the more likely it is that one's destructive behavior will seem less bad.&lt;ref name="Bandura1999"/&gt; For example, ''"the massive destruction in Vietnam was minimized by portraying the American military intervention as saving the populace from Communist enslavement".''&lt;ref name="Bandura99-196"&gt;Bandura (1999). p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

These so-called [[exonerating]] comparisons rely on the moral justification by [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian standards]]. Two sets of judgements facilitate making destructive behavior morally acceptable. Firstly, non-violent alternatives are judged to be ineffective to achieve desired changes and consequently eliminated as options.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Selective Moral Disengagement in the Exercise of Moral Agency|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0305724022014322|journal = Journal of Moral Education|date = 2002-06-01|issn = 0305-7240|pages = 101–119|volume = 31|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/0305724022014322|first = Albert|last = Bandura}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Secondly, utilitarian analyses affirm that one's injurious actions will prevent more human suffering than they cause."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Selective Moral Disengagement in the Exercise of Moral Agency|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0305724022014322|journal = Journal of Moral Education|date = 2002-06-01|issn = 0305-7240|volume = 31|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/0305724022014322|first = Albert|last = Bandura|page =106}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Bandura]] suggested that applying the [[utilitarian calculus]] in specific situations is "quite slippery" because of the uncertainties that the future contains and the biases in human judgement. According to his belief, the calculation process of estimating the significance of potential threats is subjective.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Albert Bandura]] also argues that moral justification and advantageous comparison are the most effective "self-disinhibitors" because they eliminate self-censure and change the appreciation of the self in the service of harmful activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory|last = Bandura|first = Albert|publisher = Prentice-Hall, Inc.|year = 1986|isbn = 0-13-815614-X|location = New Jersey|pages = 375–389}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''"What was once morally condemnable becomes a source of self-valuation".''&lt;ref name="Bandura99-196"/&gt;

=== Displacement of responsibility ===
Another [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociative]] practice, known as '''displacement of responsibility''', operates by distorting the relationship between actions and the effects they cause. People behave in ways they would normally oppose if a legitimate authority accepts responsibility for the consequences of that behavior. Displacement of responsibility distorts facts. Under these conditions people view their actions as dictates of authorities rather than their own actions.&lt;ref name="Bandura1999"/&gt;

When people agree to being contributors to adverse results, it leads to strong operation of moral control involving themselves in harmful activity while trying to minimize the effect of that activity. They play the role of an agent of moral disengagement and start to behave in ways they ordinarily disavow if an appropriate authority accepts responsibility for their behavior. Personal liability for conduct drives people to view their actions as coming from authoritative figures under displaced responsibility. Not being the true agents of their actions, they are saved from '''self-condemnation'''. Displacement of responsibility revealed gruesome inhumanities through '''self-exemption''' in mass executions sanctioned socially. '''Self-exonerating''' deference to gruesome orders is evident in military atrocities, such as the [[My Lai]] massacre.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Violence without moral restraint: Reflections on the dehumanization of victims and victimizers|last = Kelman|first = H.C.|date = 1973|journal = Journal of Social Issues |volume=29 |pages=25–61 |doi = 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1973.tb00102.x|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perpetration of inhumanities requires devoted functionaries. If responsibility for their behavior is cast off, they would be unreliable in performance of their duties. A strong sense of responsibility is required to be a good functionary. Responsibility is characterized in two levels: a strong sense of duty towards superiors, and accountability for effects caused by one's actions.Best functionaries honor their obligations towards their authorities and do not feel personally responsible for the effects caused by their actions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Obedience to Authority: an experimental view|last = Milgram|first = S.|date = 1974|work = |via = New York, Harper &amp; Row}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diffusion of responsibility ===
Additionally, there is the practice of '''[[diffusion of responsibility]]'''. It occurs in a group of people, where with the increasing number of people, the level of diffusion increases. In this phenomenon, a person has lower inclination towards responsibility as they feel that others are also equally responsible in the group. Assumptions are made on the basis that other people are responsible for taking action. Responsibility is diffused by '''[[Division of labour|division of labor]]'''.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; Tasks that are subdivided seem harmless and easy to carry out. This shifts attention to the details of their specific job. Decision making in groups is a practice that makes otherwise polite people to behave inhumanely. [[Collective action]] provides [[anonymity]], which allows weakening of moral control. Any harmful activity carried out in the group can be associated to others actions. People in groups act inhumanely when they personally held accountable for their actions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Disinhibition of aggression through diffusion of responsibility and dehumanization of victims,|last = Bandura, A., Underwood, B., Fromson, M.E.|first = |date = 1975|journal = Journal of Research in Personality |volume=9 |pages=253–269 |doi = 10.1016/0092-6566(75)90001-x|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The psychology of evil: a situationist perspective on recruiting good people to engage in anti-social acts|last = Zimbardo|first = P.G.|date = 1995|journal = Research in Social Psychology |volume=11 |pages=125–133 |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretical and practical importance of diffusion of responsibility is neglected in escalation literature, as the most commonly extended definition of escalation for which there is substantial factual support is based on the impression of '''[[self-justification]]'''.Though initial decisions with regard to new framework are made by people on their own, most imperative decisions are taken by the group in a managerial context. Thus, generally the offered description for persistence in error may be irrelevant or at least have lower relevance to situations of escalation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.csub.edu/~mdulcich/documents/diffusion_of_responsibility.pdf|title = Diffusion of Responsibility: Effects on the Escalation Tendency|last = Whyte|first = Glen|date = 1991|journal = Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=408–415|doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.76.3.408|pmid = |access-date = 19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effects of diffusion of responsibility on escalation tendency show that in the initial stages of group projects there is reduced escalation effects in those individuals who take the inaugural steps in a failing project than individuals who are personally held reliable for those initial decisions. [[Self-justification theory|Self justification theory]] is of lower importance in groups than in individuals because most decisions in organizations are taken by groups in form of new policies and regulations. When decisions fail, people subjectively disfigure consequences to make themselves appear more agreeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Attitudinal and behavioral consequences of changing a major organizational reward: A natural field experiment.|last = Staw|first = B.|date = 1974|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |issue=6 |pages=742–751 |doi = 10.1037/h0036292|pmid = |volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reduction of cognitive dissonance through task enhancement and effort expenditure.|last = Weick|first = K.|date = 1964|journal = Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume= 68|pages= 533–539|doi = 10.1037/h0047151 |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This distortion occurs when people try to psychologically safeguard themselves in an attempt to [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalize]] their actions. People try to justify actions taken previously in the past which leads them to take a failing course of action. Though these actions taken previously lead to escalated commitment, a decision to stay in the same course of action could be damaged by the extent to which a person shares the responsibility for initiating that failing course of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The escalation of commitment to a course of action|last = Staw|first = B.|date = 1981|journal = Academy of Management Review |volume=6 |pages=577–587 |doi = 10.5465/amr.1981.4285694|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after participating in a decision, an individual can evade responsibility in two ways. The first is where the responsibility or the blame is transferred to the third party for improper action. In this case, a person feels less responsible for the failure caused by them along with the inclination to the failing project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Diffusability of blame: Effects on persistence in a project|last = Leatherwood, M.L., &amp; Conlon, E.J.|first = |date = 1987|journal = Academy of Management Journal |volume=30 |pages=836–848 |doi = 10.2307/256165|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Commitment to a policy decision: A multi-theoretical perspective.|last = Staw, B., &amp; Ross, J.|first = |date = 1978|journal = Administrative Science Quarterly |volume=23 |pages=40–64 |doi = 10.2307/2392433|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other way to evade responsibility is when the group takes the initial decision of pursuing the failing project. The blame of a poor decision is shared within the group, allocating less responsibility to each member for the decision than it would have been if the decision was made by one person alone. [[Social interaction]] may curtail the propensity to escalate commitment to a defeated course of action by diffusing responsibility for the original decision and discouraging the arousal of intentions to justify previous behavior.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.csub.edu/~mdulcich/documents/diffusion_of_responsibility.pdf|title = Diffusion of Responsibility: Effects on the Escalation Tendency|last = Whyte|first = Glen|date = 1991|journal = Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=408–415|doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.76.3.408|pmid = |access-date = 19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disregarding or misrepresenting injurious consequences ===
Another method of disengagement is through disregard or '''[[misrepresentation]]''' of the consequences of action. When someone decides to pursue an activity harmful to others for personal advantage, or as a result of impact by social stimulus, they generally either minimize the harm they have caused or attempt to avoid facing it. People would willingly begin to recollect prior information regarding the potential benefits of the behavior but are less likely to recall its harmful effects the behavior would cause to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Brock|first1 = Timothy C.|last2 = Buss|first2 = Arnold H.|title = Dissonance, aggression, and evaluation of pain|journal = The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|date = 1962|volume = 65|issue = 3|pages = 197–202|doi=10.1037/h0048948}}&lt;/ref&gt; People are especially inclined to the minimize harmful effects when they act alone. When the harm caused to the victim becomes less evident and personalized, people are more likely to execute inhumanities requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Milgram|first1 = Stanley|title = Obedience to authority: an experimental view|date = 1974|publisher = Harper &amp; Row|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from selective inattention and subjectively cognitive distortion of effects, the misrepresentation of consequences may also involve persistent efforts to eliminate evidence of the damage they cause to others. Therefore, there is little reason for self-censure or moral codes to be triggered as long as the harm is overlooked, minimized or distorted.

It is relatively easy to hurt others when the detrimental results of one's conduct are ignored, and when causal effects are not visible because they are remote from one's behaviour on the physical and mental level.&lt;ref name="bandura 19992"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Bandura|first = Albert|title = Moral Disengagement in the Perpetration of Inhumanities|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Review|date = 1 July 1999|volume = 3|issue = 3|pages = 193–209|doi = 10.1207/s15327957pspr0303_3|url = http://www.des.emory.edu/mfp/Bandura1999PSPR.pdf|accessdate = 12 October 2007|pmid = 15661671}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanized weapon systems and explosive devices that can lead to severe casualty but is controlled by someone at a distance pressing one button are suited examples elucidating such depersonalized action. Even there exists a high level personal responsibility in people, they will still execute detrimental behaviours when the harm they inflict on their victims are not realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Tilker|first1 = Harvey A.|title = Socially responsible behavior as a function of observer responsibility and victim feedback|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date = 1970|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 95–100|doi=10.1037/h0028773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals try to cut off the connections between harmful activities and self-sanctions by distorting the consequences associated with a given act. For instance, ''"use of this mechanism in sport is seen when players avoid finding out the extent of injuries sustained by opponents or deny the seriousness of the injuries of which they are aware".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Boardley|first1 = Ian D.|last2 = Kavussanu|first2 = Maria|title = Development and validation of the moral disengagement in sport scale|journal = Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology|date = 2007|volume = 29|issue = 5|page = 608|url = http://eprints.bham.ac.uk/672/1/Boardley2007.pdf|accessdate = 20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, when people are aware of the suffering they cause, indirectly awakened distress and self-censure start to function and serve as self-restraining influences. For example, people are less likely to obey to execute detrimental behaviours as the victim's pain became more evident and personalized.

It is commonly seen that nowadays most of the organisations have a clear set of hierarchical chains where people in the upper level come up with plans pass them down to their subordinates known as executors, who then carry them out. It appears that the further the individuals are away from the end results, the feeble is the binding power of the foreseeable destructive effects. Disengagement of personal control normally exists among people who are situated between the top and the bottom in a hierarchical system because they can get away with the responsibility of formulating the plans, and they are not involved in executing the decisions. As a transmitter, they attempt to model dutiful behavior and further legitimize their superiors. Therefore, intermediaries are much more prone to implement destructive commands than are those who are in charge of coming up with new plans and who are responsible for carrying them out and facing the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Kilham|first1 = Wesley|last2 = Mann|first2 = Leon|title = Level of destructive obedience as a function of transmitter and executant roles in the Milgram obedience paradigm|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date = 1974|volume = 29|issue = 5|pages = 696–702|doi=10.1037/h0036636|pmid=4833430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dehumanization ===
Dehumanization is the process through which a person or group of people are denied 'humanness' or human attributes. The victim is no longer viewed as a person with feelings, hopes and concerns, but objectified as a lesser sub-human.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Denying humanness to victims: How gang members justify violent behavior|url = http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/17/6/750|journal = Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|date = 2014-11-01|issn = 1368-4302|pages = 750–762|volume = 17|issue = 6|doi = 10.1177/1368430214536064|first = Emma|last = Alleyne|first2 = Isabel|last2 = Fernandes|first3 = Elizabeth|last3 = Pritchard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dehumanization is identified as one of the mechanisms of moral disengagement, as it justifies treating others with less moral concern and empathy, and therefore validates violent or abusive treatment towards others.&lt;ref name="van Noorden 320–328"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dehumanization in children: The link with moral disengagement in bullying and victimization|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ab.21522/abstract|journal = Aggressive Behavior|date = 2014-07-01|issn = 1098-2337|pages = 320–328|volume = 40|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/ab.21522|pmid = 24375450|first = Tirza H.J.|last = van Noorden|first2 = Gerbert J.T.|last2 = Haselager|first3 = Antonius H.N.|last3 = Cillessen|first4 = William M.|last4 = Bukowski}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dehumanization involves the [[moral exclusion]] and [[Delegitimisation|delegitimization]] of others.&lt;ref name="Tileagă 717–737"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ideologies of moral exclusion: A critical discursive reframing of depersonalization, delegitimization and dehumanization|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/014466607X186894/abstract|journal = British Journal of Social Psychology|date = 2007-12-01|issn = 2044-8309|pages = 717–737|volume = 46|issue = 4|doi = 10.1348/014466607X186894|first = Cristian|last = Tileagă}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moral exclusion]] occurs when groups or individuals are excluded from an ingroup's sphere of moral values, rules and beliefs.

There are two aspects of dehumanization: the denial of uniquely human attributes, and the denial of human nature attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Deliberating on Social Targets' Goal Instrumentality Leads to Dehumanization: An Experimental Investigation|url = http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/soco.2014.32.2.181|journal = Social Cognition|date = 2014-03-19|issn = 0278-016X|pages = 181–189|volume = 32|issue = 2|doi = 10.1521/soco.2014.32.2.181|first = Hong|last = Zhang|first2 = Darius K.-S.|last2 = Chan|first3 = Qian|last3 = Cao}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uniquely human attributes refer to those characteristics that discriminates a human from other [[animal species]]. Such attributes include morality, [[rationality]], civility and refinement.&lt;ref name="Vaes 64–106"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = We are human, they are not: Driving forces behind outgroup dehumanisation and the humanisation of the ingroup|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10463283.2012.665250|journal = European Review of Social Psychology|date = 2012-03-01|issn = 1046-3283|pages = 64–106|volume = 23|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/10463283.2012.665250|first = Jeroen|last = Vaes|first2 = Jacques-Philippe|last2 = Leyens|first3 = Maria Paola|last3 = Paladino|first4 = Mariana Pires|last4 = Miranda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas, human nature attributes involve characteristics such as, warmth, agency, [[emotionality]] and [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]] openness, which discriminates a human from inanimate objects.&lt;ref name="Vaes 64–106"/&gt;

When attributing human nature to groups of people, ingroup and outgroup biases come into play. People identify themselves with their [[social group]] (ingroup) and dissociate themselves from social groups to which they believe they don't identify with (outgroup).&lt;ref name="Vaes 64–106"/&gt;

The denial of uniquely human attributes lead to a metaphor-based dehumanization process which associates the social outgroup to non-humans, comparing them to animals.&lt;ref name="van Noorden 320–328"/&gt; [[Ideological]] and historically embedded beliefs about the human-animal divide create the perception that human beings are superior to all other animals. Therefore, by likening the [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] to animals, they are perceived as less rational and sophisticated, which ultimately creates a psychological barrier that allows for the justification of negative behavior towards the 'non-human' outgroup.&lt;ref name="Costello 278–288"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Lay beliefs about the causes of and solutions to dehumanization and prejudice: do nonexperts recognize the role of human–animal relations?|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jasp.12221/abstract|journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date = 2014-04-01|issn = 1559-1816|pages = 278–288|volume = 44|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/jasp.12221|first = Kimberly|last = Costello|first2 = Gordon|last2 = Hodson}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process of animalistic dehumanization is most commonly established through the use of metaphors. For example, the Nazi's regularly compared the Jews to 'rats', and the Hutu's interchangeably used the term Tutsis and 'cockroach' in the majority of their propaganda.&lt;ref name="Vaes 64–106"/&gt; The use and effectiveness of these metaphors work on the aspect of moral disgust. Many animals such as snakes, leeches and rats tend to strike an unconscious automatic reaction of disgust, and therefore, by likening an outgroup to these animals the negative and 'disgusting' attributes of these animals are metaphorically projected onto the outgroup.&lt;ref name="Vaes 64–106"/&gt;

The denial of human nature attributes lead to an attribute-based dehumanization process which separates the outgroup from human characteristics involving emotions, therefore likening them to inanimate objects. This process is referred to as mechanistic dehumanization.&lt;ref name="van Noorden 320–328"/&gt; By denying the out group human nature attributes they are perceived as robotic and unemotional, leading the ingroup to be less empathetic towards them.&lt;ref name="Costello 278–288"/&gt;

Infra-humanization theory is another key aspect to dehumanization. It is the belief that ones ingroup is more 'human' than the outgroup in terms of uniquely human attributes and secondary emotions.&lt;ref name="van Noorden 320–328"/&gt; Whereas primary emotions (surprise, anger, fear) are commonly seen as shared amongst the entire animal kingdom, secondary emotions (hope, remorse, regret) are viewed as purely human characteristics.&lt;ref name="Vaes 64–106"/&gt; These [[secondary emotions]] are socially determined and seen as essential to constituting humanness. However, ingroup bias tends to attribute these secondary emotions towards themselves, but deny or lessen the extent of these emotions in the outgroup, thus leading to the out group being portrayed as 'lesser-humans'.&lt;ref name="Vaes 64–106"/&gt;

== Antecedents ==

=== Individual differences ===
James R. Detert, Linda K. Treviño and Vicki L. Sweitzer&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Moral disengagement in ethical decision making: A study of antecedents and outcomes|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0021-9010.93.2.374|journal = Journal of Applied Psychology|date = 2008-01-01|volume = 93|issue = 2|pages = 374–391|doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.93.2.374|pmid = 18361639|first = James R.|last = Detert|first2 = Linda Klebe|last2 = Treviño|first3 = Vicki L.|last3 = Sweitzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; propose that some individuals are more inclined to morally disengage than others. Based on their study, they found that certain [[individual differences]] predict and influence moral disengagement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Specifically, James R. Detert, Linda K. Treviño and Vicki L. Sweitzer&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; found that being more acutely aware of the needs and feelings of others prevents moral disengagement activities. Individuals with high [[empathy]] are less likely to morally disengage from acts that would harm others. Further, their study also suggested that [[Cynicism (contemporary)|trait cynicism]] is facilitator of moral disengagement. ''"Individuals high on trait cynicism have an underlying distrust of other people and therefore are more sceptical about motives of others, including targets of harm, and will be more likely to think that such targets deserve their fate".''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Moral disengagement in ethical decision making: A study of antecedents and outcomes.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0021-9010.93.2.374|journal = Journal of Applied Psychology|date = 2008-01-01|volume = 93|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.93.2.374|first = James R.|last = Detert|first2 = Linda Klebe|last2 = Treviño|first3 = Vicki L.|last3 = Sweitzer|page =377|pmid=18361639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, trait cynics' lack of trust in others makes the process of distancing themselves from and diffuse responsibility to others easier. The same applies to blaming and dehumanising victims. In addition, they found that chance [[locus of control]] orientation is another individual characteristic that is positively related to moral disengagement. That is, people who believe life experiences and outcomes are due to external forces, are more likely to morally disengage. Their findings also shows that the higher self-importance of moral identity the less prone individuals are to moral disengagement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For individuals with a highly self-important moral identity, "moral concerns" and commitments are crucial in their self-definition and [[self-concept]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The self-importance of moral identity|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1423|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date = 2002-01-01|volume = 83|issue = 6|pages = 1423–1440|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1423|pmid = 12500822|first = Karl|last = Aquino|last2 = Americus|first3 = II|last3 = Reed}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence less likely to cognitively re-construe destructive and harmful conduct as being morally acceptable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Interplay of personal and social sanctions ===
[[Social cognitive theory of morality|Social cognitive theory]] suggests an [[interactionist perspective]] to [[morality]]. People do not operate as [[Autonomy|autonomous]] moral agents unaffected by the social realities in which they are embedded, and hence [[moral agency]] is socially situated. [[Moral agency]] is exercised in "particularized ways" depending on the conditions under which people's everyday life transactions are taking place.&lt;ref name="Bandura1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; According to this view, moral actions are therefore the outcome of this reciprocal interplay of personal and social influences.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Social cognitive theory of morality|Social cognitive theory]] lists three different modes of [[human agency]], personal, proxy and collective.

Speaking of personal control, in many circumstances, people usually cannot directly control social conditions or institutional practices that effect their daily lives. People would then try by one means or another to get those experts who are resourceful or who can produce influence and power to act at their behest to secure the desirable outcomes. It is impossible to master every aspect of daily life with limited time, energy, and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Bandura|first1 = Albert|title = Social cognitive theory: An agentic perspective|journal = Annual Review of Psychology|date = 2001|volume = 52|issue = 1|pages = 1–26|url = http://moodle2.cs.huji.ac.il/nu14/pluginfile.php/179670/mod_resource/content/1/Bandura_2001.pdf|accessdate = 21 September 2015|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.1|pmid=11148297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People also attempt to seek proxy control in areas where they can exert direct influence when they have not developed the means to do so, they believe others can achieve better results, or they do not want to involve themselves into burdensome aspects that direct control causes. To maintain effective control under the evolving conditions of life, it requires mastery of knowledge and skills which are only attainable through continued investment of time, effort, and resources.

The collective agency stems from human beings' characteristics of [[socializing]]. Human beings are social animals. Inevitably, people are involved in a variety of relationships with others. And in many circumstances progress is only achievable with socially interdependent effort. Therefore, people often cooperate with others to secure what they cannot accomplish individually. People's shared belief is a key ingredient of collective agency. People acting collectively on a shared belief, not as an inane member of a group is what is performing the cognizing, aspiring, motivating and regulating functions for the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Bandura|first1 = Albert|title = Social cognitive theory: An agentic perspective|journal = Annual Review of Psychology|date = 2001|volume = 52|issue = 1|pages = 1–26|url = http://moodle2.cs.huji.ac.il/nu14/pluginfile.php/179670/mod_resource/content/1/Bandura_2001.pdf|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.1|pmid=11148297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==

=== Unethical decision making and deceptive behavior ===
[[Albert Bandura]] argued that when considering the various mechanisms of moral disengagement, humane personal standards are not enough to renounce inhumane conduct. Civilised life demands safeguards as an integral part of social systems to uphold moral personal control and "compassionate" conduct.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In investigating the outcomes of moral disengagement, James R. Detert, Linda K. Treviño and Vicki L. Sweitzer found empirical evidence supporting their hypothesis that morally disengagement is positively associated with making unethical decisions. The higher levels of moral disengagement the more increased likelihood of [[unethical]] decision making. A disconnect between internal moral standards and "contemplated actions" reduces the activation internalized deterrents that otherwise would prevent people from acting unethically.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Adam Barsky investigated the effects of moral disengagement and participation on unethical work behavior across two studies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Investigating the Effects of Moral Disengagement and Participation on Unethical Work Behavior|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-011-0889-7|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|date = 2011-06-16|issn = 0167-4544|pages = 59–75|volume = 104|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s10551-011-0889-7|first = Adam|last = Barsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research focused on moral disengagement through moral justifaction and displacement of responsibility and unethical behavior as deceptive behaviors such as "outright lying", and "attempts to obscure the truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Investigating the Effects of Moral Disengagement and Participation on Unethical Work Behavior|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-011-0889-7|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|date = 2011-06-16|issn = 0167-4544|page=61|volume = 104|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s10551-011-0889-7|first = Adam|last = Barsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of Adam Barsky's studies also empirically demonstrated a significant relation between moral disengagement and people's likelihood of unethical decision making, in organizational literature. In the second study, Adam Barsky found empirical support for participation in goal-setting, that is, a joint decision making process, is positively related to deceptive behavior.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Investigating the Effects of Moral Disengagement and Participation on Unethical Work Behavior|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-011-0889-7|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|date = 2011-06-16|issn = 0167-4544|pages = 59–75|volume = 104|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s10551-011-0889-7|first = Adam|last = Barsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Perhaps most interesting, while moral justifications tended to increase in the reported incidences of unethical behavior, this was only true when employees did not feel that they had the opportunity to participate in setting their performance goals at work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Investigating the Effects of Moral Disengagement and Participation on Unethical Work Behavior|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-011-0889-7|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|date = 2011-06-16|issn = 0167-4544|page=70|volume = 104|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s10551-011-0889-7|first = Adam|last = Barsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGraw, Best and Timpone found important consequences of moral justifications in the field of politics. They found that a controversial decision will be evaluated more positively due to moral justifications, judgement of character can also be influenced and as a result, the politician involved will receive more positive public opinions.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; McGraw concluded that moral justifications can be used deceptively by politicians to influence public opinion on controversies and to reinforce their own reputations without the fear of negative consequences.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In the field of sports, a relationship between moral disengagement and athletes' justification of [[cheating]] was found. Šukys analysed different forms of cheating and found that athletes' justification of deceptive behaviours which are related to the manipulations of sports rules and results of contests, is predicted by moral disengagement in sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Athletes' Justification of Cheating in Sport: Relationship with Moral Disengagement in Sport and Personal Factors|last = Šukys|first = Saulius|date = 2013|journal = Sportas Nr.|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 3 |issue=90|pages = 70–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military conduct ===
Destructive behaviour as a result of moral justification can often be found in military conduct. Killing, which is usually perceived as morally condemnable, can be cognitively reconstructed into even a source of pride. As a result, people can be transferred into skilled combatants surprisingly fast.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This is further facilitated by nonviolent options being judged as ineffective, and from a utilitarian point of view, when the suffering caused by the foe outweighs the suffering inflicted by violent conducts.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Kimhi and Sagy investigated the association between moral justification of army roadblocks and Israeli soldiers' feelings of adjustment. The results supported their hypothesis that the more justification of army roadblocks by the soldiers, the higher level of cognitive, affective and behavioural adjustment they felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Moral justification and feelings of adjustment to military law-enforcement situation: the case of Israeli soldiers serving at army roadblocks|last = Kimhi|first = Shaul|date = 2008|journal = Mind Soc|doi = 10.1007/s11299-008-0051-0|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Sagy|first2 = Shifra|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages = 177–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral justifications are often used by terrorists to defend their atrocious conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Origins of terrorism: Psychologies, ideologies, states of mind|last = Bandura|first = A.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1990|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 161–191|chapter = Mechanisms of moral disengagement in terrorism.|editor-last = Reich|editor-first = W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the justification of counterterrorist measures is a [[moral dilemma]] especially faced by [[democratic societies]]; the loss of innocent lives during these measures has to be justified while obeying a civilised society's [[moral codes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Of beasts, gods, and civilized men: The justification of terrorism and of counterterrorist measures.|last = Carmichael|first = D.

Studies indicate that [[bullying]] is positively related to self-reported moral disengagement in [[children]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Social cognition and moral cognition in bullying: What's wrong?|last = Gini|first = G.|date = 2006|journal = Aggressive Behavior|doi = 10.1002/ab.20153|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 32 |issue=6|pages = 528–539}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[adolescents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Moral disengagement in self-reported and peer-nominated school bullying|last = Obermann|first = M.

Pornari and Wood found that in addition to traditional peer aggression, moral disengagement is also associated with cyber aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Peer and cyber aggression in secondary school students: The role of moral disengagement, hostile attribution bias, and outcome expectancies|last = Pornari|first = C.

Further studies by Thornberg and Jungert found that among schoolchildren, significantly higher levels of moral disengagement including moral justification, euphemistic labelling, diffusion of responsibility, distorting consequences and victim attribution was expressed by boys. The number of incidences of bullying was also significantly higher in boys than girls. Among all the moral disengagement mechanisms, only moral justification and victim attribution were significantly related to bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = School Bullying and the Mechanisms of Moral Disengagement|last = Thornberg|first = Robert|date = 2014|journal = Aggressive Behavior|doi = 10.1002/ab.21509|pmid = 24496999|access-date = |last2 = Jungert|first2 = Tomas|volume = 40|issue = 2|pages = 99–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral disengagement in routinely performed self-serving activities === 
Traditionally, moral disengagement theory has been applied mainly to high moral intensity scenarios and behaviors such as interpersonal aggression, stealing or deception, and armed conflicts, which Bandura termed "extraordinary circumstances".&lt;ref name=Bandura1999&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Moral Disengagement in the Perpetration of Inhumanities |url= http://psr.sagepub.com/content/3/3/193 |journal= Personality and Social Psychology Review |date=1999-08-01 |issn= 1088-8683 |pmid= 15661671 |pages=193–209 |volume=3 |issue=3 |doi= 10.1207/s15327957pspr0303_3 |first=Albert |last=Bandura}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the role of moral disengagement in everyday situations – in which people routinely perform self-serving activities at injurious costs to others and the environment – is also receiving increased attention.&lt;ref name=Bandura2007&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Impeding ecological sustainability through selective moral disengagement |url= http://www.moraldisengagement.com/papers/MDEcology.pdf |journal= International Journal of Innovation and Sustainable Development |date=2007-08-01 |pages=193–209 |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi= 10.1504/IJISD.2007.016056 |first=Albert |last=Bandura}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, recent studies have observed moral disengagement as a situated cognitive process in meat consumption.&lt;ref name=Graca2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graça|first=João|last2=Calheiros|first2=Maria Manuela|last3=Oliveira|first3=Abílio|date=2016-02-01|title=Situating moral disengagement: Motivated reasoning in meat consumption and substitution|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285043120_Situating_moral_disengagement_Motivated_reasoning_in_meat_consumption_and_substitution|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=90|pages=353–364|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2015.11.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Graca2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graça|first1=João|last2=Calheiros|first2=Maria Manuela|last3=Oliveira|first3=Abílio|title=Moral Disengagement in Harmful but Cherished Food Practices?

[[File:Napoleon stellt den israelitischen Kult wieder her, 30. Mai 1806.jpg|thumb|275px|An 1806 French print depicts [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] emancipating the Jews.]]
[[Revolutionary France]] enacted laws that first [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipated Jews]] in France, establishing them as equal citizens to other Frenchmen. In countries that [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s ensuing [[First French Empire]] conquered during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], he emancipated the Jews and introduced other ideas of freedom from the French Revolution. For instance, he overrode old laws restricting Jews to reside in [[ghettos]], as well as lifting laws that limited Jews' rights to property, worship, and certain occupations.

In an effort to promote Jewish integration into French society, however, Napoleon also implemented several policies that eroded Jewish distinction. For example, he restricted the Jewish practice of money-lending, restricted the regions to which Jews were allowed to migrate, and required Jews to adopt formal names. He also implemented a series of consistories -- which served as an effective channel utilized by the French government to regulate Jewish religious life. 

Historians have disagreed about Napoleon's intentions in these actions, as well as his personal and political feelings about the Jewish community. Some have said he had political reasons but did not have sympathy for the Jews. His actions were generally opposed by the leaders of monarchies in other countries. After his defeat by Great Britain, a counter-revolution swept many of these countries and they restored discriminatory measures against the Jews.

==Napoleon's Law and the Jews==

The [[French Revolution]] abolished the different treatment of people according to religion or origin that had existed under the monarchy. Roman Catholicism had been the established state religion, closely tied historically to the monarchy, which represented both religious and political authority. The 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] guaranteed [[freedom of religion]] and free exercise of worship, provided that it did not contradict public order. At that time, most other European countries implemented measures that restricted the rights of people in their nations who practiced minority religions.

In the early 19th century, through his conquests in Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte spread the modernist ideas of revolutionary France: equality of citizens and the rule of law. Napoleon's personal attitude towards the Jews has been interpreted in various ways by different historians, as at various times he made statements both in support and opposition to the Jewish people.  Orthodox Rabbi [[Berel Wein]] in ''Triumph of Survival: The Story of the Jews in the Modern Era 1650-1990'' (1990) claims that Napoleon was interested primarily in seeing the Jews assimilate, rather than prosper as a distinct community: "Napoleon's outward tolerance and fairness toward Jews was actually based upon his grand plan to have them disappear entirely by means of total assimilation, intermarriage, and conversion."{{page needed|date=October 2016}}

Napoleon was concerned about the role of Jews as money lenders, wanting to end that. The treatment of the Alsace Jews and their debtors was raised in the Imperial Council on 30 April 1806.&lt;!--What were the questions and resolution?  --&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} His liberation of the Jewish communities in Italy (notably in [[Ancona]] in the [[Papal States]]) and his insistence on the integration of Jews as equals in French and Italian societies demonstrate that he distinguished between usurers (whether Jewish or not), whom he compared to [[locusts]], and Jews who accepted non-Jews as their equals.

His letter to Champagny, Minister of the Interior of 29 November 1806, expresses his thoughts:
:[It is necessary to] reduce, if not destroy, the tendency of Jewish people to practice a very great number of activities that are harmful to civilisation and to public order in society in all the countries of the world. It is necessary to stop the harm by preventing it; to prevent it, it is necessary to change the Jews. [...] Once part of their youth will take its place in our armies, they will cease to have Jewish interests and sentiments; their interests and sentiments will be French.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

(While insisting on the primacy of civil law over the military, Napoleon retained a deep respect and affection for the military as a profession. He often hired former soldiers in civilian occupations).

Through his policies overall, Napoleon greatly improved the condition of the Jews in France and Europe, and they widely admired him. Starting in 1806, Napoleon passed a number of measures enhancing the position of the [[Jew]]s in the French Empire. He recognized a representative group elected by the Jewish community, the ''[[Sanhedrin#Napoleon Bonaparte's "Grand Sanhedrin"|Sanhedrin]],'' as their representatives to the French government.

In conquered countries, he abolished laws restricting Jews to living in [[ghetto]]s. In 1807, he designated [[Judaism]] as one of the official religions of France, along with [[Roman Catholicism]] (long the established state religion), and [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinist]] [[Protestantism]]. (Followers of the latter had been severely persecuted by the monarchy in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.)

In 1808 Napoleon rolled back a number of reforms (under the so-called ''décret infâme'', or Infamous Decree, of 17 March 1808), declaring all debts with Jews to be annulled, reduced or postponed. The Infamous Decree imposed a ten-year ban on any kind of Jewish money-lending activity. Similarly, Jewish individuals who were in subservient positions -- such as a Jewish servant, military officer, or wife -- were unable to engage in any kind of money-lending activity without the explicit consent of their superiors. Napoleon's goal in implementing the Infamous Decree of 1808 was to integrate Jewish culture and customs into those of France. By restricting money-lending activity, Jews would be forced to engage in other practices for a living. Likewise, in order to even engage in money-lending activity, the decree required Jews to apply for an annual license, granted only with the recommendation of the Jews' local consistory and with the surety of the Jews' honesty&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44955842|title=The Jews of modern France|last=1946-2011.|first=Hyman, Paula,|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520919297|location=Berkeley|oclc=44955842}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This caused so much financial loss that the Jewish community nearly collapsed. On a different note, the Infamous Decree also placed heavy restrictions on the Jews' ability to migrate. The decree prevented the Jews from relocating to the regions of Alsace and required that Jews wishing to move to other regions of France own or purchase land to farm. It also required them to refrain from engaging in any kind of money-lending activity. (The law eventually only placed these restrictions on the Jews of the northeast.) Likewise, the French decree required Jewish individuals to serve in the French military, without any opportunity to provide a replacement individual&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44955842|title=The Jews of modern France|last=1946-2011.|first=Hyman, Paula,|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520919297|location=Berkeley|oclc=44955842}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The last component of the Infamous Decree – established in July 1808 – required Jews to adopt formal names with which they would be addressed. (Before, Jews were often referred to as “Joseph son of Benjamin.”) They were also prevented from selecting names of cities or names in the Hebrew Bible. Napoleon sought to integrate the Jewish people more fully into French society by establishing the guidelines they were required to follow in adopting names&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Napoleon ended these restrictions by 1811.

Historian [[Ben Weider]] argued that Napoleon had to be extremely careful in defending oppressed minorities such as Jews, because of keeping balance with other political interests, but says that the leader clearly saw political benefit to his Empire in the long term in supporting them. Napoleon hoped to use equality as a way of gaining advantage from discriminated groups, like Jews or Protestants.

Both aspects of his thinking can be seen in an 1822 response to physician Barry O'Meara, who had written to Napoleon after he had been exiled, asking why he pressed for the emancipation of the Jews:

:I wanted to make them leave off [[usury]], and become like other men...by putting them upon an equality, with Catholics, Protestants, and others, I hoped to make them become good citizens, and conduct themselves like others of the community...as their rabbins explained to them, that they ought not to practise usury to their own tribes, but were allowed to do so with Christians and others, that, therefore, as I had restored them to all their privileges...they were not permitted to practise usury with me or them, but to treat us as if we were of the tribe of Judah. Besides, I should have drawn great wealth to France as the Jews are very numerous, and would have flocked to a country where they enjoyed such superior privities. Moreover, I wanted to establish an universal liberty of conscience.&lt;ref name="o'meara"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/stream/napoleoninexile01omegoog#page/n212/mode/2up|title= Napoleon in Exile |author= Barry Edward O'Meara |year= 1822 |accessdate=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a private letter to his brother [[Jérome Napoleon]], dated 6 March 1808, Napoleon expressed a conflicting view:

:I have undertaken to reform the Jews, but I have not endeavoured to draw more of them into my realm. Far from that, I have avoided doing anything which could show any esteem for the most despicable of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/stream/newlettersnapol02napogoog#page/n99/mode/2up |title= New letters of Napoleon I |year= 1898 |accessdate=15 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bonaparte's  proclamation to the Jews of Africa and Asia===

During Napoleon's [[Siege of Acre (1799)|siege of Acre]] in 1799, ''[[Le Moniteur Universel]],'' the main French newspaper during the French Revolution, published on 3 [[Prairial]], [[French Republican Calendar/Y7|Year vii]] ([[French Republican Calendar]], equivalent to 22 May 1799) a short statement that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Buonaparte a fait publier une proclamation, dans laquelle il invite les juifs de l'Asie et de l'Afrique à venir se ranger sous ses drapeaux, pour rétablir l'ancienne Jérusalem; il en a déjà armé un grand nombre, et leurs bataillons menacent Alep."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6u8OAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=%22dans+laquelle+il+invite+les+juifs+de%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1vcETunzEcy38gP-1dytDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dans%20laquelle%20il%20invite%20les%20juifs%20de%22&amp;f=false|title=Buonaparte peint par lui-même dans sa carrière militaire et politique|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This has been translated in English as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[[Napoleon|Bonaparte]] has published a proclamation in which he invites all the Jews of Asia and Africa to gather under his flag in order to re-establish the ancient [[Jerusalem]]. He has already given arms to a great number, and their battalions threaten [[Aleppo]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.napoleonicsociety.com/french/pdf/NapoleonJuifs.pdf|title= Napoléon et les Juifs (in French) |author= Ben Weider|year= 1997 |quote= Bonaparte, Commandant en chef des Armées de la République Française en Afrique et en Asie, aux héritiers légitimes de la Palestin|pages= |publisher=Napoleonic Society| work=Congrès de la Société Internationale Napoléonienne, Alexandrie, Italie; 21-26 Juin 1997| accessdate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Napoleon's forces lost to [[Great Britain]] and he never carried out his alleged plan. Historians such as Nathan Schur in ''Napoleon and the Holy Land'' (2006) believe that Napoleon intended the proclamation for propaganda and to build support for his campaign among the Jews in those regions. Ronald Schechter believes that the newspaper was reporting a rumor, as there is no documentation that Napoleon contemplated such a policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Ronald Schechter  | title = Obstinate Hebrews: Representations of Jews in France, 1715–1815 | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2003 | page = 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians &lt;!-- who? --&gt; suggest that the proclamation was intended to gain support from [[Haim Farhi]], the Jewish advisor to [[Jezzar Pasha|Ahmed al Jazzar]], the Muslim ruler of [[Acre (city)|Acre]], and to bring him over to Napoleon's side. Farhi commanded the defence of Acre on the field.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In 1940, historian Franz Kobler claimed to have found a detailed version of the proclamation from a German translation.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Kobler, "Napoleon and the restoration of the Jews to Palestine", ''The New Judaea,'' September 1940&lt;/ref&gt; Kobler's claim was published in ''The New Judaea,'' the official periodical of the [[Zionist Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=5f0ETqOkKcSY8QOIj6zIDQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=I_NWAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22the+new+judaea%22&amp;q=%22the+new+judaea%22#search_anchor|title=The Menorah Journal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kobler version suggests that Napoleon was inviting Jews across the Mideast and North Africa to create a Jewish state.&lt;ref name="Schwarzfuchs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0197100236|title=Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin|author=Simon Schwarzfuchs 
|publisher=Routledge |date=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes phrases such as "Rightful heirs of Palestine!" and "your political existence as a nation among the nations." These concepts have been more commonly associated with the [[Zionist]] movement, which developed in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Schwarzfuchs"/&gt;

Historians such as Henry Laurens, Ronald Schechter, and Jeremy Popkin believe that the German document (which has never been found) was a forgery, as asserted by Simon Schwarzfuchs in his 1979 book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Simon Schwarzfuchs | title = Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin | publisher = Routledge | year = 1979 | pages = 24–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Laurens (scholar)|Laurens, Henry]], ''Orientales I, Autour de l'expédition d'Égypte'', pp.123–143, CNRS Éd (2004), {{ISBN|2-271-06193-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9udsEHFtikkC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=%22franz+kobler%22+napoleon+1799&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ev0ETuSsBIiw8gP20LC0DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22franz%20kobler%22%20napoleon%201799&amp;f=false Ronald Schechter, ''Obstinate Hebrews: Representations of Jews in France, 1715–1815''], 2003.

Rabbi Aharon Ben-Levi of Jerusalem also added his voice to the proclamation, calling on the Jews to enlist in Napoleon's army "to return to Zion as in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah" and rebuild the Temple. According to Prof. [[Mordechai Gichon]], a military historian and archaeologist from Tel Aviv University, who summarized 40 years of research on the subject, Napoleon had an idea to establish a national home for the Jews in the Land of Israel, "Napoleon believed the Jews would repay his favors by serving French interests in the region."Gichon claimed. "After returning to France, all he was interested in when it came to the Jews was how to use them to reinforce the French nation," Gichon says. "Therefore, he tried to conceal the Zionist chapter of his past." On the other hand, Prof. Ze'ev Sternhell of Jerusalem's Hebrew University, however, believes the entire story is nothing more than an oddity. "Napoleon's big contribution came, in fact, in form of promoting the incorporation of the Jews into French society," &lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/1.4827319&lt;/ref&gt;

==Napoleon's legacy==
Napoleon had more influence on the Jews in Europe than detailed in his decrees. By breaking up the feudal castes of mid-Europe and introducing the equality of the [[French Revolution]], he achieved more for Jewish emancipation than had been accomplished during the three preceding centuries. As part of recognizing the Jewish community, he established a national [[Consistory (Judaism)|Israelite Consistory]] in France. It was intended to serve as a centralizing authority for Jewish religious and community life. Napoleon implemented several other regional consistories throughout the French Empire, as well, with the Israelite Consistory serving as the lead consistory; it had the responsibility of overseeing the various regional consistories. The regional consistories, in turn, oversaw the economic and religious aspects of Jewish life. The regional consistories consisted of a five-individual board, usually occupied by one (or, in some cases two) rabbis, and the rest lay individuals who lived in the districts over which the consistory maintained jurisdiction. The Israelite Consistory in France consisted of three rabbis and two lay individuals. In charge of the Israelite Consistory (and the consistory system in general) was a 25-member board. The members of the board, all Jews, were appointed by the prefect, thus allowing the French government to regulate the system of consistories and, in turn, various aspects of Jewish life&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44955842|title=The Jews of modern France|last=1946-2011.|first=Hyman, Paula,|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520919297|location=Berkeley|oclc=44955842}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Similarly he established the [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Royal Westphalian Consistory of the Israelites|he|3=הקונסיסטוריה היהודית של וסטפליה}}). This served as a model for other German states until after the fall of Napoleon. Napoleon permanently improved the condition of the Jews in the Prussian [[Rhine provinces]] by his rule of this area.

[[Heinrich Heine|Heine]] and [[Ludwig Börne|Börne]] both recorded their sense of obligation to Napoleon's principles of action.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The German Jews in particular have historically regarded Napoleon as the major forerunner of Jewish emancipation in Germany. When the government required Jews to select surnames according to the mainstream model, some are said to have taken the name of ''Schöntheil,'' a translation of "Bonaparte."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} In the Jewish ghettos, legends grew up about Napoleon's actions. Twentieth-century Italian author [[Primo Levi]] wrote that Italian Jews often chose ''Napoleone'' and ''Bonaparte'' as their [[given name]] to recognize their historic liberator.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Reactions of major European powers===

The Russian [[Alexander I of Russia|Czar Alexander I]] objected to Napoleon's emancipation of the Jews and establishment of the Great Sanhedrin. He vehemently denounced the liberties given Jews and demanded that the Russian Orthodox Church protest against Napoleon's tolerant religious policy. He referred to the Emperor in a proclamation as "the Anti-Christ" and the "Enemy of God".{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The Holy Synod of Moscow proclaimed: "In order to destroy the foundations of the Churches of Christendom, the Emperor of the French has invited into his capital all the Judaic synagogues and he furthermore intends to found a new Hebrew [[Sanhedrin]] ― the same council that the Christian bible states, condemned to death (by crucifixion) the revered figure, Jesus of Nazareth."{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The Czar persuaded Napoleon to sign a 17 March 1808 decree restricting the freedoms accorded to the Jews. Napoleon expected in exchange that the Czar would help persuade Great Britain to end the war in Europe. Absent that, three months later, Napoleon effectively cancelled the decree by allowing local authorities to implement his earlier reforms. More than half of the French départements restored citizens' guaranteed freedoms to the Jews.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In Austria, [[Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich|Chancellor Metternich]] wrote, "I fear that the Jews will believe (Napoleon) to be their promised Messiah".{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In Prussia, leaders of the Lutheran Church were extremely hostile to Napoleon's actions. Italian kingdoms were suspicious of his actions, although expressing less violent opposition. {{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Great Britain, which was at war with Napoleon, rejected the principle and doctrine of the Sanhedrin.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Jews in Europe===

All the states under French authority applied Napoleon's reforms. In Italy, the Netherlands, and the German states, the Jews were emancipated and able to act as free men for the first time in those nations. After the British defeated Napoleon at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]], a counter-revolution in many of these countries resulted in the restoration of discriminatory measures against Jews.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3659">'''Narcissistic neurosis''' is a term introduced by [[Sigmund Freud]] to distinguish the class of [[neurosis|neuroses]] characterised by their lack of [[object relations theory|object relations]] and their fixation upon the early stage of libidinal [[narcissism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 471-2&lt;/ref&gt; The term is less current in contemporary psychoanalysis,&lt;ref&gt;J. Laplanche/J-B Pontalis, ''The Language of Psychoanalysis'' (2012) p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; but still a focus for analytic controversy.&lt;ref&gt;J-M Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (2005) p. 132-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud considered such neurosis as impervious to psychoanalytic treatment, as opposed to the [[transference neurosis]] where an emotional connection to the analyst was by contrast possible.&lt;ref&gt;''Introductory Lectures'' p. 473 and p. 499&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud's changing ideas==
Freud originally applied the term "narcissistic neurosis" to a range of disorders, including perversion, depression, and [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Quinodoz, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, however, he came to single out "illnesses which are based on a conflict between the ego and the [[super-ego]]... we would set aside the name of 'narcissistic psycho-neuroses' for disorders of that kind"&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;—[[melancholia]] being the outstanding example.

About the same time, in the wake of the work of [[Karl Abraham]], he began to modify to a degree his view on the inaccessibility of narcissistic neurosis to analytic treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; However his late lectures from the thirties confirmed his opinion of the unsuitability of narcissistic and psychotic conditions for treatment "to a greater or less extent";&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; as did his posthumous 'Outline of Psychoanalysis'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 447&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==
From the twenties onwards, Freud's views of the inaccessibility of the narcissistic neuroses to analytic influence had been challenged, first by [[Melanie Klein]],&lt;ref&gt;Quinodoz, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; and then by object relations theorists more broadly.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (1993) p. xi-ii&lt;/ref&gt;

While classical analysts like [[Robert Waelder]] would maintain Freud's delimiting standpoint into the sixties, eventually even within [[ego psychology]] challenges to the 'off-limits' view of what were increasingly seen as [[Borderline personality disorder|borderline disorders]] emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (1988) p. 129-32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Relational psychoanalysis]], like [[Heinz Kohut]], would also take a more positive approach to narcissistic neurosis, emphasising the need for a partial or initial participation in the narcissistic illusions.&lt;ref&gt;G. Mascialino, ''A Critical Appraisal of Relational Approaches to Psychoanalysis'' (2008) p. 56-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In retrospect, Freud's caution may be seen as a result of his unwillingeness to work with the [[negative transference]], unlike the post-Kleinians.&lt;ref&gt;Quinodoz, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nuclear physics}}
In [[nuclear physics]], '''nuclear fusion''' is a [[nuclear reaction|reaction]] in which two or more [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] are combined to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles ([[neutrons]] or [[protons]]). The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release or absorption of [[energy]]. This difference in mass arises due to the difference in atomic "[[binding energy]]" between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction. Fusion is the process that powers active or "[[main sequence]]" [[star]]s, or other [[Absolute magnitude|high magnitude]] stars.

A fusion process that produces a nucleus lighter than [[iron-56]] or [[nickel-62]] will generally yield a net energy release. These elements have the smallest mass per nucleon and the largest [[binding energy]] per [[nucleon]], respectively. Fusion of light elements toward these releases energy (an [[exothermic]] process), while a fusion producing nuclei heavier than these elements will result in energy retained by the resulting nucleons, and the resulting reaction is [[endothermic]]. The opposite is true for the reverse process, [[nuclear fission]]. This means that the lighter elements, such as hydrogen and [[helium fusion|helium]], are in general more fusible; while the heavier elements, such as [[Uranium 235|uranium]], [[thorium]] and [[Plutonium 239|plutonium]], are more fissionable. The extreme [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] event of a [[supernova]] can produce enough energy to fuse nuclei into elements heavier than iron.

In 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] suggested hydrogen-helium fusion could be the primary source of stellar energy. [[Quantum tunneling]] was discovered by [[Friedrich Hund]] in 1929, and shortly afterwards [[Robert d'Escourt Atkinson|Robert Atkinson]] and [[Fritz Houtermans]] used the measured masses of light elements to show that large amounts of energy could be released by fusing small nuclei. Building on the early experiments in [[nuclear transmutation]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]], laboratory fusion of [[Isotopes of hydrogen|hydrogen isotopes]] was accomplished by [[Mark Oliphant]] in 1932. In the remainder of that decade, the theory of the main cycle of nuclear fusion in stars were worked out by [[Hans Bethe]].  Research into fusion for military purposes began in the early 1940s as part of the [[Manhattan Project]].  Fusion was accomplished in 1951 with the [[Greenhouse Item]] nuclear test.  Nuclear fusion on a large scale in an explosion was first carried out on November 1, 1952, in the [[Ivy Mike]] [[hydrogen bomb]] test.

Research into developing controlled [[thermonuclear fusion]] for civil purposes began in earnest in the 1940s, and it continues to this day.

The release of energy with the fusion of light elements is due to the interplay of two opposing forces: the [[nuclear force]], which combines together protons and neutrons, and the [[Coulomb force]], which causes protons to repel each other. Protons are positively charged and repel each other by the Coulomb force, but they can nonetheless stick together, demonstrating the existence of another, short-range, force referred to as nuclear attraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/chapter/1903 Physics Flexbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228011150/http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/chapter/1903 |date=28 December 2011 }}. Ck12.org. Retrieved on 2012-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Light nuclei (or nuclei smaller than iron and nickel) are sufficiently small and proton-poor allowing the nuclear force to overcome repulsion. This is because the nucleus is sufficiently small that all nucleons feel the short-range attractive force at least as strongly as they feel the infinite-range Coulomb repulsion. Building up nuclei from lighter nuclei by fusion releases the extra energy from the net attraction of particles. [[iron peak|For larger nuclei]], however, no energy is released, since the nuclear force is short-range and cannot continue to act across  longer atomic length scales. Thus, energy is not released with the fusion of such nuclei; instead, energy is required as input for such processes.

Fusion powers [[star]]s and produces virtually all elements in a process called [[nucleosynthesis]]. The Sun is a main-sequence star, and, as such, generates its energy by nuclear fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium. In its core, the Sun fuses 620 million metric tons of hydrogen and makes 606 million metric tons of helium each second.&lt;!-- Meant generally; please do not insert info about [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], [[supernova nucleosynthesis]] and other types of specific nucleosynthesis here. --&gt; The fusion of lighter elements in stars releases energy and the mass that always accompanies it. For example, in the fusion of two hydrogen nuclei to form helium, 0.7% of the mass is carried away in the form of kinetic energy of an [[alpha particle]] or other forms of energy, such as electromagnetic radiation.&lt;ref name="bulletin1950"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bethe |first=Hans A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mg4AAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA99 |title=The Hydrogen Bomb |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=April 1950 |volume=6 |issue=4 |page=99–104, 125–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It takes considerable energy to force nuclei to fuse, even those of the lightest element, [[hydrogen]]. When accelerated to high enough speeds, nuclei can overcome this electrostatic repulsion and brought close enough such that the attractive [[nuclear force]] is greater than the repulsive Coulomb force. The [[strong force]] grows rapidly once the nuclei are close enough, and the fusing nucleons can essentially "fall" into each other and the result is fusion and net energy produced. The fusion of lighter nuclei, which creates a heavier nucleus and often a [[free neutron]] or proton, generally releases more energy than it takes to force the nuclei together; this is an [[exothermic reaction|exothermic process]] that can produce self-sustaining reactions.

Energy{{anchor|energy}} released in most [[nuclear reaction]]s is much larger than in [[chemical reaction]]s, because the [[binding energy]] that holds a nucleus together is greater than the energy that holds [[electron]]s to a nucleus. For example, the [[ionization energy]] gained by adding an electron to a hydrogen nucleus is {{val|13.6|ul=eV}}—less than one-millionth of the {{val|17.6|ul=MeV}} released in the [[deuterium]]–[[tritium]] (D–T) reaction shown in the adjacent diagram. The complete conversion of one [[gram]] of matter would release 9×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; joules of energy. Fusion reactions have an [[energy density]] many times greater than [[nuclear fission]]; the reactions produce far greater energy per unit of mass even though ''individual'' fission reactions are generally much more energetic than ''individual'' fusion ones, which are themselves millions of times more energetic than chemical reactions. Only [[Direct energy conversion|direct conversion]] of [[Mass-energy equivalence|mass into energy]], such as that caused by the [[annihilation|annihilatory]] collision of [[matter]] and [[antimatter]], is more energetic per unit of mass than nuclear fusion.

Research into using [[fusion power|fusion]] for the production of electricity has been pursued for over 60 years. Successful accomplishment of controlled fusion has been stymied by scientific and technological difficulties; nonetheless, important progress has been made. At present, controlled fusion reactions have been unable to produce break-even (self-sustaining) controlled fusion.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most advanced approaches for it are magnetic confinement (toroid designs) and inertial confinement (laser designs).

Workable designs for a toroidal reactor that theoretically will deliver ten times more fusion energy than the amount needed to heat plasma to the required temperatures are in development (see [[ITER]]). The ITER facility is expected to finish its construction phase in 2019. It will start commissioning the reactor that same year and initiate plasma experiments in 2020, but is not expected to begin full deuterium-tritium fusion until 2027.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iter.org/proj/iterandbeyond |title=ITER – the way to new energy |year=2014 |website=ITER |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922162049/http://www.iter.org/proj/iterandbeyond |archivedate=22 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear fusion in stars==
[[Image:FusionintheSun.svg|thumb|250px|right|The [[proton-proton chain reaction]], branch&amp;nbsp;I, dominates in stars the size of the Sun or smaller.]]

[[Image:CNO Cycle.svg|thumb|250px|right|The [[CNO cycle]] dominates in stars heavier than the Sun.]]

An important fusion process is the [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] that powers [[star]]s and the Sun. In the 20th century, it was recognized that the energy released from nuclear fusion reactions accounted for the longevity of stellar heat and light. The fusion of nuclei in a star, starting from its initial hydrogen and helium abundance, provides that energy and synthesizes new nuclei as a byproduct of the fusion process.  Different reaction chains are involved, depending on the mass of the star (and therefore the pressure and temperature in its core).

Around 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion processes in [[star]]s, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.&lt;ref name=eddington&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |first=A. S. |last=Eddington |journal=The Scientific Monthly |volume=11 |issue=4  |date=October 1920 |page=297-303 |jstor=6491}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eddington2&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1916MNRAS..77...16E|title=On the radiative equilibrium of the stars|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=77|pages=16–35|author1=Eddington|first1=A. S.|year=1916|doi=10.1093/mnras/77.1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein's equation ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered. Eddington's paper, based on knowledge at the time, reasoned that:

:# The leading theory of stellar energy, the [[contraction hypothesis]], should cause stars' rotation to visibly speed up due to [[conservation of angular momentum]]. But observations of [[Cepheid]] variable stars showed this was not happening.
:# The only other known plausible source of energy was conversion of matter to energy; Einstein had shown some years earlier that a small amount of matter was equivalent to a large amount of energy. 
:# [[Francis William Aston|Francis Aston]] had also recently shown that the mass of a [[helium]] atom was about 0.8% less than the mass of the four hydrogen atoms which would, combined, form a helium atom, suggesting that if such a combination could happen, it would release considerable energy as a byproduct.
:# If a star contained just 5% of fusible hydrogen, it would suffice to explain how stars got their energy. (We now know that most 'ordinary' stars contain far more than 5% hydrogen)
:# Further elements might also be fused, and other scientists had speculated that stars were the "crucible" in which light elements combined to create heavy elements, but without more accurate measurements of their [[atomic mass]]es nothing more could be said at the time.

All of these speculations were proven correct in the following decades.

The primary source of solar energy, and similar size stars, is the fusion of hydrogen to form helium (the [[proton-proton chain]] reaction), which occurs at a solar-core temperature of 14 million kelvin. The net result is the fusion of four [[proton]]s into one [[alpha particle]], with the release of two [[positron]]s and two [[neutrino]]s (which changes two of the protons into neutrons), and energy. In heavier stars, the [[CNO cycle]] and other processes are more important. As a star uses up a substantial fraction of its hydrogen, it begins to synthesize heavier elements. The heaviest elements are synthesized by fusion that occurs as a more massive star undergoes a violent [[supernova]] at the end of its life, a process known as [[supernova nucleosynthesis]].

==Requirements==

A substantial energy barrier of electrostatic forces must be overcome before fusion can occur. At large distances, two naked nuclei repel one another because of the repulsive [[electrostatic force]] between their [[electric charge|positively charged]] protons. If two nuclei can be brought close enough together, however, the electrostatic repulsion can be overcome by the quantum effect in which nuclei can [[quantum tunnelling#Nuclear fusion in stars|tunnel]] through coulomb forces.

When a [[nucleon]] such as a [[proton]] or [[neutron]] is added to a nucleus, the nuclear force attracts it to all the other nucleons of the nucleus (if the atom is small enough), but primarily to its immediate neighbours due to the short range of the force. The nucleons in the interior of a nucleus have more neighboring nucleons than those on the surface. Since smaller nuclei have a larger surface area-to-volume ratio, the binding energy per nucleon due to the [[nuclear force]] generally increases with the size of the nucleus but approaches a limiting value corresponding to that of a nucleus with a diameter of about four nucleons. It is important to keep in mind that nucleons are [[Quantum physics|quantum objects]]. So, for example, since two neutrons in a nucleus are identical to each other, the goal of distinguishing one from the other, such as which one is in the interior and which is on the surface, is in fact meaningless, and the inclusion of quantum mechanics is therefore necessary for proper calculations.

The electrostatic force, on the other hand, is an [[inverse square law|inverse-square force]], so a proton added to a nucleus will feel an electrostatic repulsion from ''all'' the other protons in the nucleus. The electrostatic energy per nucleon due to the electrostatic force thus increases without limit as nuclei atomic number grows.

[[Image:Nuclear fusion forces diagram.svg|left|350px|thumb|The [[electrostatic force]] between the positively charged nuclei is repulsive, but when the separation is small enough, the quantum effect will tunnel through the wall.  Therefore, the prerequisite for fusion is that the two nuclei be brought close enough together for a long enough time for quantum tunnelling to act.]]

The net result of the opposing electrostatic and strong nuclear forces is that the binding energy per nucleon generally increases with increasing size, up to the elements [[iron]] and [[nickel]], and then decreases for heavier nuclei. Eventually, the [[binding energy]] becomes negative and very heavy nuclei (all with more than 208 nucleons, corresponding to a diameter of about 6 nucleons) are not stable. The four most tightly bound nuclei, in decreasing order of [[binding energy]] per nucleon, are {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Nickel|62}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Iron|58}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Iron|56}}, and {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Nickel|60}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin2.html#c1 The Most Tightly Bound Nuclei]. Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu. Retrieved on 2011-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the [[isotopes of nickel|nickel isotope]], {{SimpleNuclide2|Nickel|62}}, is more stable, the [[isotopes of iron|iron isotope]] {{SimpleNuclide2|Iron|56}} is an [[order of magnitude]] more common. This is due to the fact that there is no easy way for stars to create {{SimpleNuclide2|Nickel|62}} through the alpha process.

An exception to this general trend is the [[helium-4]] nucleus, whose binding energy is higher than that of [[lithium]], the next heaviest element. This is because protons and neutrons are [[fermion]]s, which according to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] cannot exist in the same nucleus in exactly the same state. Each proton or neutron's energy state in a nucleus can accommodate both a spin up particle and a spin down particle. Helium-4 has an anomalously large binding energy because its nucleus consists of two protons and two neutrons, so all four of its nucleons can be in the ground state. Any additional nucleons would have to go into higher energy states.  Indeed, the helium-4 nucleus is so tightly bound that it is commonly treated as a single quantum mechanical particle in nuclear physics, namely, the [[alpha particle]].

The situation is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they approach each other, all the protons in one nucleus repel all the protons in the other. Not until the two nuclei actually come close enough for long enough so the strong [[nuclear force]] can take over (by way of tunneling) is the repulsive electrostatic force overcome. Consequently, even when the final energy state is lower, there is a large energy barrier that must first be overcome. It is called the [[Coulomb barrier]].

The Coulomb barrier is smallest for isotopes of hydrogen, as their nuclei contain only a single positive charge. A [[diproton]] is not stable, so neutrons must also be involved, ideally in such a way that a helium nucleus, with its extremely tight binding, is one of the products.

Using [[Tritium#Deuterium|deuterium-tritium]] fuel, the resulting energy barrier is about 0.1&amp;nbsp;MeV. In comparison, the energy needed to remove an [[electron]] from [[hydrogen]] is 13.6&amp;nbsp;eV, about 7500 times less energy. The (intermediate) result of the fusion is an unstable &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;He nucleus, which immediately ejects a neutron with 14.1&amp;nbsp;MeV. The recoil energy of the remaining &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He nucleus is 3.5&amp;nbsp;MeV, so the total energy liberated is 17.6&amp;nbsp;MeV. This is many times more than what was needed to overcome the energy barrier.

[[Image:fusion rxnrate.svg|right|300px|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The DT rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&amp;nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvin) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]

The reaction '''[[cross section (physics)|cross section]]''' σ is a measure of the probability of a fusion reaction as a function of the relative velocity of the two reactant nuclei. If the reactants have a distribution of velocities, e.g. a thermal distribution, then it is useful to perform an average over the distributions of the product of cross section and velocity. This average is called the 'reactivity', denoted &lt;σv&gt;. The reaction rate (fusions per volume per time) is &lt;σv&gt; times the product of the reactant number densities:

:&lt;math&gt;f = n_1 n_2 \langle \sigma v \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

If a species of nuclei is reacting with a nucleus like itself, such as the DD reaction, then the product &lt;math&gt;n_1n_2&lt;/math&gt; must be replaced by &lt;math&gt;(1/2)n^2&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\langle \sigma v \rangle&lt;/math&gt; increases from virtually zero at room temperatures up to meaningful magnitudes at temperatures of [[1 E-15 J|10]]–[[1 E-14 J|100]]&amp;nbsp;keV. At these temperatures, well above typical [[ion]]ization energies (13.6&amp;nbsp;eV in the hydrogen case), the fusion reactants exist in a [[Plasma physics|plasma]] state.

The significance of &lt;math&gt;\langle \sigma v \rangle&lt;/math&gt; as a function of temperature in a device with a particular energy [[confinement time]] is found by considering the [[Lawson criterion]].  This is an extremely challenging barrier to overcome on Earth, which explains why fusion research has taken many years to reach the current advanced technical state.&lt;ref name=lawson&gt;[http://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/5763/20130323/lawson-criteria-make-fusion-power-viable-iter.htm What Is The Lawson Criteria, Or How to Make Fusion Power Viable&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inertial confinement fusion]] ('''ICF''')  is a method aimed at releasing [[fusion energy]] by heating and compressing a fuel target, typically a pellet containing [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]].

=== Inertial electrostatic confinement ===
{{main article|Inertial electrostatic confinement}}

[[Inertial electrostatic confinement]] is a set of devices that use an electric field to heat ions to fusion conditions.  The most well known is the [[fusor]].  Starting in 1999, a number of amateurs have been able to do amateur fusion using these homemade devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fusor.net/board/ |title=Fusor Forums • Index page |publisher=Fusor.net |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clhsonline.net/sciblog/index.php/2012/03/build-a-nuclear-fusion-reactor-no-problem/ |title=Build a Nuclear Fusion Reactor?

===Beam-beam or beam-target fusion===
If the energy to initiate the reaction comes from [[particle accelerator|accelerating]] one of the nuclei, the process is called ''beam-target'' fusion; if both nuclei are accelerated, it is ''beam-beam'' fusion.

Accelerator-based light-ion fusion is a technique using particle accelerators to achieve particle kinetic energies sufficient to induce light-ion fusion reactions. Accelerating light ions is relatively easy, and can be done in an efficient manner—requiring only a vacuum tube, a pair of electrodes, and a high-voltage transformer; fusion can be observed with as little as 10 kV between the electrodes. The key problem with accelerator-based fusion (and with cold targets in general) is that fusion cross sections are many orders of magnitude lower than Coulomb interaction cross sections. Therefore, the vast majority of ions expend their energy emitting [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation and the ionization of atoms of the target. Devices referred to as sealed-tube [[neutron generator]]s are particularly relevant to this discussion. These small devices are miniature particle accelerators filled with deuterium and tritium gas in an arrangement that allows ions of those nuclei to be accelerated against hydride targets, also containing deuterium and tritium, where fusion takes place, releasing a flux of neutrons. Hundreds of neutron generators are produced annually for use in the petroleum industry where they are used in measurement equipment for locating and mapping oil reserves.

===Muon-catalyzed fusion===
[[Muon-catalyzed fusion]] is a fusion process that occurs at ordinary temperatures. It was studied in detail by [[Steven E. Jones|Steven Jones]] in the early 1980s. Net energy production from this reaction has been unsuccessful because of the high energy required to create [[muon]]s, their short 2.2&amp;nbsp;µs [[half-life]], and the high chance that a muon will bind to the new [[alpha particle]] and thus stop catalyzing fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jones, S.E. |title=Muon-Catalysed Fusion Revisited |journal=Nature |volume=321 |pages=127–133 |year=1986 |doi=10.1038/321127a0|bibcode = 1986Natur.321..127J |issue=6066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other principles===
[[File:TCV vue gen.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Tokamak à configuration variable]]'', research fusion reactor, at the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]] (Switzerland).]]

Some other confinement principles have been investigated.

[[Antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion|Antimatter-initialized fusion]] uses small amounts of [[antimatter]] to trigger a tiny fusion explosion. This has been studied primarily in the context of making [[nuclear pulse propulsion]], and [[pure fusion bomb]]s feasible. This is not near becoming a practical power source, due to the cost of manufacturing antimatter alone.

[[Pyroelectric fusion]] was reported in April 2005 by a team at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. The scientists used a [[pyroelectricity|pyroelectric]] crystal heated from −34 to 7&amp;nbsp;°C (−29 to 45&amp;nbsp;°F), combined with a [[tungsten]] needle to produce an [[electric field]] of about 25&amp;nbsp;gigavolts per meter to ionize and accelerate [[deuterium]] nuclei into an [[erbium]] deuteride target.  At the estimated energy levels,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v434/n7037/suppinfo/nature03575.html Supplementary methods for "Observation of nuclear fusion driven by a pyroelectric crystal"].

Although it makes a useful neutron generator, the apparatus is not intended for power generation since it requires far more energy than it produces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rodan.physics.ucla.edu/pyrofusion/ UCLA Crystal Fusion].

[[Nuclear fusion-fission hybrid|Hybrid nuclear fusion-fission (hybrid nuclear power)]] is a proposed means of generating [[Electrical power industry|power]]  by use of a combination of nuclear fusion and [[Nuclear fission|fission]] processes. The concept dates to the 1950s, and was briefly advocated by [[Hans Bethe]] during the 1970s, but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in 2009, due to the delays in the realization of pure fusion.&lt;ref name="hybrid"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gerstner, E. | title = Nuclear energy: The hybrid returns | year = 2009 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 460 | issue = 7251| pages = 25–8 | pmid = 19571861|doi=10.1038/460025a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Project PACER]], carried out at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL) in the mid-1970s, explored the possibility of a fusion power system that would involve exploding small [[H-bomb|hydrogen bomb]]s (fusion bombs) inside an underground cavity. As an energy source, the system is the only fusion power system that could be demonstrated to work using existing technology. However it would also require a large, continuous supply of nuclear bombs, making the economics of such a system rather questionable.

===Astrophysical reaction chains===
At the temperatures and densities in stellar cores the rates of fusion reactions are notoriously slow. For example, at solar core temperature (''T'' ≈ 15&amp;nbsp;MK) and density (160&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), the energy release rate is only 276&amp;nbsp;μW/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;—about a quarter of the volumetric rate at which a resting human body generates heat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fusedweb.pppl.gov/CPEP/Chart_Pages/5.Plasmas/SunLayers.html FusEdWeb | Fusion Education]. Fusedweb.pppl.gov (1998-11-09). Retrieved on 2011-08-17. {{Dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, reproduction of stellar core conditions in a lab for nuclear fusion power production is completely impractical. Because nuclear reaction rates depend on density as well as temperature and most fusion schemes operate at relatively low densities, those methods are strongly dependent on higher temperatures. The fusion rate as a function of temperature (exp(−''E''/''kT'')), leads to the need to achieve temperatures in terrestrial reactors 10–100 times higher temperatures than in stellar interiors: ''T'' ≈ 0.1–1.0×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; K.

===Criteria and candidates for terrestrial reactions===
{{main article|Fusion power#Fuels}}
In artificial fusion, the primary fuel is not constrained to be protons and higher temperatures can be used, so reactions with larger cross-sections are chosen. Another concern is the production of neutrons, which activate the reactor structure radiologically, but also have the advantages of allowing volumetric extraction of the fusion energy and [[tritium]] breeding. Reactions that release no neutrons are referred to as [[Aneutronic fusion|''aneutronic'']].

To be a useful energy source, a fusion reaction must satisfy several criteria. It must:

;Be [[exothermic]]: This limits the reactants to the low ''Z'' (number of protons) side of the [[Nuclear binding energy#Nuclear binding energy curve|curve of binding energy]]. It also makes helium {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Helium|4}} the most common product because of its extraordinarily tight binding, although {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Helium|3}} and {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Hydrogen|3}} also show up.
;Involve low atomic number (''Z'') nuclei: This is because the electrostatic repulsion that must be overcome before the nuclei are close enough to fuse is directly related to the number of protons it contains - its atomic number.{{citation needed|date=November 2015|reason=This implies a relationship between atomic number (Z) and activation energy (in addition to its relation to binding energy), which isn't established/cited here.}}
;Have two reactants: At anything less than stellar densities, three body collisions are too improbable. In inertial confinement, both stellar densities and temperatures are exceeded to compensate for the shortcomings of the third parameter of the Lawson criterion, ICF's very short confinement time.
;Have two or more products: This allows simultaneous conservation of energy and momentum without relying on the electromagnetic force.
;Conserve both protons and neutrons: The cross sections for the weak interaction are too small.

Few reactions meet these criteria. The following are those with the largest cross sections:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Nucleosynthesis}}

For reactions with two products, the energy is divided between them in inverse proportion to their masses, as shown. In most reactions with three products, the distribution of energy varies. For reactions that can result in more than one set of products, the branching ratios are given.

Some reaction candidates can be eliminated at once. The D-&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li reaction has no advantage compared to [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Boron|11}} because it is roughly as difficult to burn but produces substantially more neutrons through {{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|Deuterium}} side reactions. There is also a [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Lithium|7}} reaction, but the cross section is far too low, except possibly when ''T''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1 MeV, but at such high temperatures an endothermic, direct neutron-producing reaction also becomes very significant. Finally there is also a [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|Beryllium|9}} reaction, which is not only difficult to burn, but {{nuclide|link=yes|Beryllium|9}} can be easily induced to split into two alpha particles and a neutron.

In addition to the fusion reactions, the following reactions with neutrons are important in order to "breed" tritium in "dry" fusion bombs and some proposed fusion reactors:

The latter of the two equations was unknown when the U.S. conducted the [[Castle Bravo]] fusion bomb test in 1954. Being just the second fusion bomb ever tested (and the first to use lithium), the designers of the Castle Bravo "Shrimp" had understood the usefulness of Lithium-6 in tritium production, but had failed to recognize that Lithium-7 fission would greatly increase the yield of the bomb. While Li-7 has a small neutron cross-section for low neutron energies, it has a higher cross section above 5 MeV.&lt;ref name=cross_section&gt;[http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/atomic_and_nuclear_physics/4_7/4_7_4c.html Subsection 4.7.4c]. Kayelaby.npl.co.uk. Retrieved on 2012-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 15 Mt yield was 150% greater than the predicted 6 Mt and caused unexpected exposure to fallout.

To evaluate the usefulness of these reactions, in addition to the reactants, the products, and the energy released, one needs to know something about the cross section. Any given fusion device has a maximum plasma pressure it can sustain, and an economical device would always operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that &lt;σv&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product ''nT''τ required for [[Fusion energy gain factor#Ignition|ignition]] is a minimum, since that required value is inversely proportional to &lt;σv&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (see [[Lawson criterion]]). (A plasma is "ignited" if the fusion reactions produce enough power to maintain the temperature without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of &lt;σv&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.

Note that many of the reactions form chains. For instance, a reactor fueled with {{nuclide|tritium}} and {{nuclide|helium|3}} creates some {{nuclide|deuterium}}, which is then possible to use in the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}} reaction if the energies are "right". An elegant idea is to combine the reactions (8) and (9). The {{nuclide|helium|3}} from reaction (8) can react with {{nuclide|lithium|6}} in reaction (9) before completely thermalizing. This produces an energetic proton, which in turn undergoes reaction (8) before thermalizing. Detailed analysis shows that this idea would not work well,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} but it is a good example of a case where the usual assumption of a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] plasma is not appropriate.

===Neutronicity, confinement requirement, and power density===
[[Image:IvyMike2.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The only man-made fusion device to achieve [[Fusion gain factor|ignition]] to date is the [[hydrogen bomb]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}  The detonation of the first device, codenamed [[Ivy Mike]], occurred in 1952 and is shown here.]]
Any of the reactions above can in principle be the basis of [[fusion power]] production. In addition to the temperature and cross section discussed above, we must consider the total energy of the fusion products ''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;, the energy of the charged fusion products ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;, and the atomic number ''Z'' of the non-hydrogenic reactant.

Specification of the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction entails some difficulties, though. To begin with, one must average over the two branches (2i) and (2ii). More difficult is to decide how to treat the {{nuclide|tritium}} and {{nuclide|helium|3}} products. {{nuclide|tritium}} burns so well in a deuterium plasma that it is almost impossible to extract from the plasma. The {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}} reaction is optimized at a much higher temperature, so the burnup at the optimum {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} temperature may be low. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume the {{nuclide|tritium}} but not the {{nuclide|helium|3}} gets burned up and adds its energy to the net reaction, which means the total reaction would be the sum of (2i), (2ii), and (1):

:5 {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}} → {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|4}} + 2 [[Neutron|n&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;]] + {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}} + [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]],  ''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.03+17.6+3.27 = 24.9&amp;nbsp;MeV, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.03+3.5+0.82 = 8.35&amp;nbsp;MeV.

For calculating the power of a reactor (in which the reaction rate is determined by the D-D step), we count the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} fusion energy ''per D-D reaction'' as ''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; = (4.03&amp;nbsp;MeV + 17.6&amp;nbsp;MeV)×50% + (3.27&amp;nbsp;MeV)×50% = 12.5&amp;nbsp;MeV and the energy in charged particles as ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; = (4.03&amp;nbsp;MeV + 3.5&amp;nbsp;MeV)×50% + (0.82&amp;nbsp;MeV)×50% = 4.2&amp;nbsp;MeV. (Note: if the tritium ion reacts with a deuteron while it still has a large kinetic energy, then the kinetic energy of the helium-4 produced may be quite different from 3.5 MeV,&lt;ref&gt;A momentum and energy balance shows that if the tritium has an energy of E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; (and using relative masses of 1, 3, and 4 for the neutron, tritium, and helium) then the energy of the helium can be anything from [(12E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;−(5×17.6MeV+2×E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/25 to [(12E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;+(5×17.6MeV+2×E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/25. For E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;=1.01&amp;nbsp;MeV this gives a range from 1.44&amp;nbsp;MeV to 6.73&amp;nbsp;MeV.&lt;/ref&gt; so this calculation of energy in charged particles is only an approximation of the average.) The amount of energy per deuteron consumed is 2/5 of this, or 5.0&amp;nbsp;MeV (a [[specific energy]] of about 225 million [[Megajoule|MJ]] per kilogram of deuterium).

Another unique aspect of the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction is that there is only one reactant, which must be taken into account when calculating the reaction rate.

With this choice, we tabulate parameters for four of the most important reactions

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto;"
|-

|-
|{{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|helium|3}}                   ||  2  || 18.3 ||18.3 || ≈0.05
|-
|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-{{nuclide|boron|11}}              ||  5  || 8.7  || 8.7 || ≈0.001
|}

The last column is the '''[[aneutronic fusion|neutronicity]]''' of the reaction, the fraction of the fusion energy released as neutrons. This is an important indicator of the magnitude of the problems associated with neutrons like radiation damage, biological shielding, remote handling, and safety. For the first two reactions it is calculated as (''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;-''E''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt;)/''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;. For the last two reactions, where this calculation would give zero, the values quoted are rough estimates based on side reactions that produce neutrons in a plasma in thermal equilibrium.

Of course, the reactants should also be mixed in the optimal proportions. This is the case when each reactant ion plus its associated electrons accounts for half the pressure. Assuming that the total pressure is fixed, this means that particle density of the non-hydrogenic ion is smaller than that of the hydrogenic ion by a factor 2/(''Z''+1). Therefore, the rate for these reactions is reduced by the same factor, on top of any differences in the values of &lt;σv&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. On the other hand, because the {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} reaction has only one reactant, its rate is twice as high as when the fuel is divided between two different hydrogenic species, thus creating a more efficient reaction.

Thus there is a "penalty" of (2/(Z+1)) for non-hydrogenic fuels arising from the fact that they require more electrons, which take up pressure without participating in the fusion reaction. (It is usually a good assumption that the electron temperature will be nearly equal to the ion temperature. Some authors, however discuss the possibility that the electrons could be maintained substantially colder than the ions. In such a case, known as a "hot ion mode", the "penalty" would not apply.) There is at the same time a "bonus" of a factor 2 for {{nuclide|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|deuterium}} because each ion can react with any of the other ions, not just a fraction of them.

We can now compare these reactions in the following table.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto;"

|}

The maximum value of &lt;σv&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is taken from a previous table. The "penalty/bonus" factor is that related to a non-hydrogenic reactant or a single-species reaction. The values in the column "inverse reactivity" are found by dividing 1.24{{e|-24}} by the product of the second and third columns. It indicates the factor by which the other reactions occur more slowly than the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction under comparable conditions. The column "[[Lawson criterion]]" weights these results with ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ch&lt;/sub&gt; and gives an indication of how much more difficult it is to achieve ignition with these reactions, relative to the difficulty for the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction. The next-to-last column is labeled "power density" and weights the practical reactivity by ''E''&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt;. The final column indicates how much lower the fusion power density of the other reactions is compared to the {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} reaction and can be considered a measure of the economic potential.

===Bremsstrahlung losses in quasineutral, isotropic plasmas===
The ions undergoing fusion in many systems will essentially never occur alone but will be mixed with [[electron]]s that in aggregate neutralize the ions' bulk [[electrical charge]] and form a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The electrons will generally have a temperature comparable to or greater than that of the ions, so they will collide with the ions and emit [[x-ray]] radiation of 10–30 keV energy, a process known as [[Bremsstrahlung]].

The huge size of the Sun and stars means that the x-rays produced in this process will not escape and will deposit their energy back into the plasma. They are said to be [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] to x-rays. But any terrestrial fusion reactor will be [[Optical depth|optically thin]] for x-rays of this energy range. X-rays are difficult to reflect but they are effectively absorbed (and converted into heat) in less than mm thickness of stainless steel (which is part of a reactor's shield). This means the bremsstrahlung process is carrying energy out of the plasma, cooling it.
 
The ratio of fusion power produced to x-ray radiation lost to walls is an important figure of merit. This ratio is generally maximized at a much higher temperature than that which maximizes the power density (see the previous subsection). The following table shows estimates of the optimum temperature and the power ratio at that temperature for several reactions:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto;"

|-
|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-{{nuclide|boron|11}}       ||  300 ||   0.57
|}

The actual ratios of fusion to Bremsstrahlung power will likely be significantly lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that the energy of the fusion products is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves ''must'' remain in the plasma until they have given up their energy, and ''will'' remain some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a good job of retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.

The temperatures maximizing the fusion power compared to the Bremsstrahlung are in every case higher than the temperature that maximizes the power density and minimizes the required value of the [[Lawson criterion|fusion triple product]]. This will not change the optimum operating point for {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} very much because the Bremsstrahlung fraction is low, but it will push the other fuels into regimes where the power density relative to {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|tritium}} is even lower and the required confinement even more difficult to achieve. For {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}} and {{nuclide|link=yes|deuterium}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}, Bremsstrahlung losses will be a serious, possibly prohibitive problem. For {{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}-{{nuclide|link=yes|helium|3}}, [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|lithium|6}} and [[Proton|p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]-{{nuclide|link=yes|boron|11}} the Bremsstrahlung losses appear to make a fusion reactor using these fuels with a quasineutral, isotropic plasma impossible. Some ways out of this dilemma are considered—and rejected—in ''fundamental limitations on plasma fusion systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fundamental Limitations on Plasma Fusion Systems not in Thermodynamic Equilibrium|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International|volume= 56-07 |issue=Section B|page= 3820|author=Rider, Todd Harrison|bibcode=1995PhDT........45R|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rostoker, Norman; Binderbauer, Michl and Qerushi,

== Mathematical description of cross section ==

=== Fusion under classical physics ===
In a classical picture, nuclei can be understood as hard spheres that repel each other through the Coulomb force but fuse once the two spheres come close enough for contact. Estimating the radius of an atomic nuclei as about one femtometer, the energy needed for fusion of two hydrogen is:

&lt;math&gt;E_{\text{thresh}}= \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{Z_1 Z_2}{r} \xrightarrow{\text{2 protons}} \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{1 \text{ fm}} \approx 1.4 \text{ MeV}&lt;/math&gt;

This would imply that for the core of the sun, which has a [[Boltzmann distribution]] with a temperature of around 1.4 keV, the probability hydrogen would reach the threshold is &lt;math&gt;10^{-290}&lt;/math&gt;, that is, fusion would never occur. However, fusion in the sun does occur due to quantum mechanics.

=== Parameterization of cross section ===
The probability that fusion occurs is greatly increased compared to the classical picture, thanks to the smearing of the effective radius as the [[Matter wave|DeBroglie wavelength]] as well as [[quantum tunnelling]] through the potential barrier. To determine the rate of fusion reactions, the value of most interest is the [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]], which describes the probability that particle will fuse by giving a characteristic area of interaction.  An estimation of the fusion cross sectional area is often broken into three pieces:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma \approx \sigma_{geometry} \times T \times R&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{geometry} &lt;/math&gt; is the geometric cross section, {{mvar|T}} is the barrier transparency and {{mvar|R}} is the reaction characteristics of the reaction. 

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{geometry} &lt;/math&gt; is of the order of the square of the de-Broglie wavelength &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{geometry} \approx \lambda^2 = \bigg( \frac{\hbar^2}{m_r v} \bigg)^2 \propto \frac{1}{\epsilon} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m_r &lt;/math&gt; is the reduced mass of the system and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon  &lt;/math&gt; is the center of mass energy of the system. 

{{mvar|T}} can be approximated by the Gamow transparency, which has the form: &lt;math&gt;T \approx e^ {- \sqrt{\epsilon_G /\epsilon} } &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_G = ( \pi \alpha Z_1 Z_2)^2 \times 2 m_r c^2 &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gamow factor]] and comes from estimating the quantum tunneling probability through the potential barrier. 

{{mvar|R}} contains all the nuclear physics of the specific reaction and takes very different values depending on the nature of the interaction. However, for most reactions, the variation of &lt;math&gt;R(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; is small compared to the variation from the Gamow factor and so is approximated by a function called the [[S-factor|Astrophysical S-factor]], &lt;math&gt;S(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, which is weakly varying in energy. Putting these dependencies together, one approximation for the fusion cross section as a function of energy takes the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(\epsilon) \approx \frac{S(\epsilon)}{\epsilon} e^{ - \sqrt{ \epsilon_G/\epsilon}}&lt;/math&gt;

More detailed forms of the cross section can be derived through nuclear physics based models and R matrix theory.

=== Formulas of fusion cross sections ===

The '''original camera negative''' ('''OCN''') is the film in a traditional film-based [[movie camera]] which captures the original image.  This is the film from which all other copies will be made. It is known as '''raw stock''' prior to exposure.

The size of a roll varies depending on the [[film gauge]] and whether or not a new roll, [[re-can]], or [[short end]] was used. One hundred or 400 foot rolls are common in 16mm, while 400 or 1,000 foot (ft) rolls are used in 35mm work. While these are the most common sizes, other lengths such as 200, 800, or 1,200 ft may be commercially available from film stock manufacturers, usually by special order. Rolls of 100 and 200 ft are generally wound on spools for daylight-loading, while longer lengths are only wound around a plastic core. Core-wound stock has no exposure protection outside its packaging, and therefore must be loaded into a [[camera magazine]] within a [[darkroom]] or changing bag/tent in order to prevent the film being fogged.

== Value ==
Original camera negative is of great value, as if lost or damaged it cannot be re-created without re-shooting the scene, something which is often impossible. It also contains the highest-quality version of the original image available, before any analog resolution and dynamic range loss from copying. For these reasons, original camera negative is handled with great care, and only by specialized trained people in dedicated film laboratories.

==Procedures in the laboratory==
After the film is processed by the [[film lab]], camera rolls are assembled into lab rolls of 1,200 to 1,500 ft. Work prints may be made for viewing dailies or editing the picture on film.

Once [[film editing]] is finalized, a [[negative cutting|negative cutter]] will conform the negative using the [[Keykode]] on the edge of the film as a reference, cutting the original camera negative and incorporating any opticals (titles, dissolves, fades, and special effects), and cementing it together into several rolls. 

The edited original negative is then copied to create a safety positive which can be used as a backup to create a usable negative. At this point, an [[answer print]] will be created from the original camera negative, and upon its approval, [[interpositive]]s (IPs) and [[internegative]]s (INs) are created, from which the [[release print]]s are made. Generally speaking, the original camera negative is considered too important and delicate to be used for any processes more than necessary, as each pass through a lab process carries the risk of further degrading the quality of the negative by scratching the emulsion. Once an answer print is approved, the interpositives and internegatives are regarded as the earliest generation of the finished and graded film, and are almost always used for transfers to video or new film restorations. The original camera negatives is usually regarded as a last resort in the event that all of the intermediate elements have been compromised or lost.

The more popular a film is, the higher the likelihood that the original negative is in a worse shape, due to the need to return to the original camera negative to strike new interpositives to replace the exhausted ones, and thus create more internegatives and release prints. Before 1969, 35mm prints were struck directly from the original negative, often running into hundreds of copies, and causing further wear on the original.{{Citation needed|reason=Oh really? I can imagine that prints from the early years of film were struck directly off the original negative, but I seriously doubt this continued through the Golden Age and as late as 1969. --Retro00064|date=June 2013}}

== Digital cameras ==
Physical [[film stock]] is still occasionally used in film-making, particularly in prestige productions where the director and cinematographer have the power to require the extra cost, but as of 2016, it is becoming increasingly rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/1503-Summer-2015/Industry-Film-is-Dead.aspx|title=Christopher Nolan fights to keep film alive|last=Hart|first=Hugh|date=Summer 2015|website=www.dga.org|publisher=Directors Guild of America|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern cinematography, the camera is usually a [[digital camera]], and no physical negative exists. However, the concept of "camera original material" is still used to describe camera image data. Camera original material that has not yet been ingested, duplicated, and archived is in a similar precarious state to original camera negative in a film process. One of the jobs of the [[digital imaging technician]] is to ensure that digital camera original material is backed up as soon as possible.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to domestic violence:

'''[[Domestic violence]]''' – pattern of abusive behaviors by one or both partners in an [[intimate relationship]], such as marriage, dating, family, or cohabitation. It is also known as domestic abuse, spousal abuse, battering, family violence, and intimate partner violence (IPV).

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is domestic violence? ==

Domestic violence can be described as all of the following:

* [[Violence]] – use of physical force to apply a state to others contrary to their wishes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/violence ''Violence.''], Merriam-Webster Dictionary Retrieved January 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/violence?view=uk ''Violence.''], Oxford English Dictionary Retrieved January 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/0/V0110000.html ''Violence.''], American Heritage Dictionary, Violence, Retrieved January 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and may include some combination of [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[psychological abuse|emotional]], [[economic abuse|economic]], [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]].
* [[Abusive power and control|Control]] – Braiker identified the following ways that [[Psychological manipulation|manipulators]] control their victims:&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;Braiker, Harriet B. (2004) ''Who's Pulling Your Strings? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation'' {{ISBN|0-07-144672-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Positive reinforcement]]: [[praise]], [[superficial charm]], superficial [[sympathy]] ([[crocodile tears]]), excessive apologizing; money, approval, gifts; attention, facial expressions such as a forced laugh or smile; public recognition.
** [[Negative reinforcement]]: removing one from a negative situation as a reward. For example: "You won't have to walk home if you allow me to do this to you."
** [[Reinforcement#Schedules|Intermittent or partial reinforcement]]: partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective climate of fear and doubt. Partial or intermittent positive reinforcement can encourage the victim to persist.
** [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]]: berating, yelling, refusing to speak to partner, intimidation, threats, [[profanity|swearing]], [[emotional blackmail]], the [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] trap, sulking, crying, and [[playing the victim]].
** Traumatic one-trial learning: verbal abuse, explosive anger, or other intimidating behavior to establish dominance or superiority; even one incident of such behavior can [[classical conditioning|condition]] or train victims to avoid upsetting, confronting or contradicting the manipulator.
* [[Oppression]] – exercise of authority or power in a burdensome, cruel, or unjust manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aolsvc.merriam-webster.aol.com/dictionary/oppression ''Oppression.''] Merriam Webster Online.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be defined as an act or instance of oppressing, the state of being oppressed, and the feeling of being heavily burdened, mentally or physically, by troubles, adverse conditions, and anxiety.

== Prevalence ==
[[Epidemiology of domestic violence]] – [[Domestic violence]] occurs across the world, in various cultures,&lt;ref name="watts2002"&gt;Watts C.; Zimmerman C. (April 2002) "Violence against women: global scope and magnitude." ''Lancet.'' '''359'''(9313):1232–7. {{PMID|11955557}}. {{doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08221-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and affects people across society, irrespective of economic status&lt;ref name="waits1985"&gt;Waits, Kathleen. (1984–1985). "The Criminal Justice System's Response to Battering: Understanding the Problem, Forging the Solutions." ''Washington Law Review.'' '''60''':267–330.&lt;/ref&gt; or gender.

== Forms ==

The following table includes the forms of violence typically defined as part of [[Intimate partner violence]], which is domestic violence in an intimate relationship by one's spouse or lover. It also includes a column for other family members or partners.

The rate of occurrence varies considerably based upon one's country, socio-economic class, culture, religion, family history and other factors.

===Men and LGBT===

* [[LGBT]] [[Domestic violence]] – an under-researched area with a very wide range of estimates of prevalence. Lesbians often have fewer resources available for shelter and counselling.&lt;ref name="10 women"&gt;[http://www.glma.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&amp;pageID=691 ''Ten Things Lesbians Should Discuss with their Health Care Providers.''] Gay and Lesbian Medical Association.

Fiebert, shows that women are as likely to be abusive to men, but the men are less likely to be hurt. However, he noted, men are seriously injured in 38% of the cases in which "extreme aggression" is used. Fiebert additionally noted that his work was not meant to minimize the serious effects of men who abuse women.{{#tag:ref|Martin S.

This bibliography examines 275 scholarly investigations: 214 empirical studies and 61 reviews and/or analyses appear to demonstrate that women are as physically aggressive, or more aggressive, than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partners.

:The [[National Institute of Justice]] (NIJ) contends that a national survey, supported by NIJ, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], and the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] that examined more serious assaults, does not support the conclusion of similar rates of male and female spousal assaults. This survey was conducted within a safety or crime context and clearly found more partner abuse by men against women.&lt;ref name="ojp.usdoj.gov"&gt;[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/topics/crime/intimate-partner-violence/measuring.htm Measuring Intimate Partner (Domestic) Violence] National Institute of Justice.

This survey tool was developed in the 1970s and may not be appropriate for intimate partner violence research because it does not measure control, coercion, or the motives for conflict tactics; it also leaves out sexual assault and violence by ex-spouses or partners and does not determine who initiated the violence.&lt;ref name="ojp.usdoj.gov"/&gt;|group=nb}}

Another study published in the [[Violence &amp; Victims|Violence &amp; Victims Journal Vol. 1]] concluded that a feminist analysis of Domestic Abuse was necessary to combat common misconceptions. The study found that 92% of women who used violence against their male partners were in self-defense, and that violence reciprocated by victims may be an integral part of abuse [[victimology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Neil | last2 = Gottman | first2 = John | title = When men batter women: new insights into ending abusive relationships | url = http://www.gottman.com/shop/when-men-batter-women/ | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York, NY | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781416551331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributing factors==
* [[Conflict tactics scale]] – research method for identifying intimate partner violence by measuring the conflict tactic behaviors.
* [[Cycle of abuse]] – [[social cycle theory]] to explain patterns of behavior of a violent intimate relationship: Tension building phase, acting-out phase, reconciliation / honeymoon phase, and calm phase, which leads back to the tension building phase.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, Lenore E. (1979) ''The Battered Woman''. New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cycle of violence]]
** Within a relationship – repeated acts of [[violence]] as a cyclical pattern, associated with high emotions and doctrines of [[Retributive justice|retribution]] or [[revenge]]. The pattern, or cycle, repeats and can happen many times during a relationship. Each phase may last a different length of time and over time the level of violence may increase.
** Intergenerational cycle of violence – violence that is passed from father to son or daughter, parent to child, or sibling to sibling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abusivelove.com/abuse_types_1_11.htm Intergenerational Cycle Of Abuse] AbusiveLove.com. Retrieved November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dynamics between partners==

* Situational couple violence – arises infrequently out of conflicts that escalate to arguments and then to violence, rather than a general pattern of control. It is likely the most common type of intimate partner violence. Women are "almost as likely" as men to be abusers, however, women are more likely to be physically injured, require police intervention and become fearful of their mates.&lt;ref name=CLASP3&gt;[http://www.clasp.org/admin/site/publications_states/files/0314.pdf ''A Sociologist’s Perspective on Domestic Violence,''] ''A Conversation with Michael Johnson, Ph.D.'' Theodora Ooms, interviewer.

* Intimate terrorism (IT) – pattern of ongoing control using emotional, physical and other forms of domestic violence.

==Impacts==
The incidence of abuse may result in the following:
* [[Effects of domestic violence on children]] – dysfunctions in the physical, behavioral, emotional, and social areas of life which affect their [[quality of life|well-being]], [[child development]], [[teen dating violence|teen dating experiences]], future domestic situations and mortality.
* [[Mental illness]] &lt;ref name=Shipway&gt;Shipway, Lynn. (2004). ''Domestic violence: a handbook for health professionals.'' New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-28220-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayhew&gt;Mayhew, P.; Mirlees-Black, C.; Percy, A. (1996) ''The 1996 British Crime Survey England &amp; Wales.'' Home Office.&lt;/ref&gt; – [[psychological]] or [[behavioral]] pattern generally associated with subjective [[suffering|distress]] or [[disability]] that occurs in an individual, and which is not a part of [[normality (behavior)|normal]] [[developmental psychology|development]] or [[culture]]. Such a disorder may consist of a combination of [[affective]], [[behavior]]al, [[cognitive]] and [[perceptual]] components.
** [[Battered person syndrome]] – physical and [[psychology|psychological condition]] victims of domestic abuse, which may be manifested as a type of [[Post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), from an ongoing [[Cycle of abuse]].
** [[Self-harm]] – intentional, direct injuring of body tissue most often done without [[suicide|suicidal]] intentions.&lt;ref name=Shipway/&gt;
* [[Suicide]],&lt;ref name=Shipway/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayhew/&gt; – act of intentionally causing one's own [[death]]. Suicide is often committed out of [[Despair (emotion)|despair]] or attributed to some underlying [[mental disorder]], such as [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], [[alcoholism]], or [[drug abuse]].&lt;ref name="Hawton, van Heeringen 2009"&gt;Hawton K.; van Heeringen, K.

==Legal==

===Remedies===
* [[Evidence-based prosecution#Context within domestic violence prosecution|Evidence-based prosecution of domestic violence]] – prosecutors aggressively trying domestic violence cases, basing their cases on evidence rather than victim cooperation, resulting in higher conviction rates.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Jeffrey. (1996).[http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/crimdom.pdf ''The Criminalization of Domestic Violence: Promises and Limits''] National Institute of Justice. Retrieved November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Injunction]] – [[equitable remedy]] in the form of a [[court order]] that requires a party to do or refrain from doing certain acts. A party that fails to comply with an injunction faces criminal or [[civil penalty|civil penalties]] and may have to pay damages or accept sanctions. In some cases, breaches of injunctions are considered serious criminal offenses that merit arrest and possible prison sentences.
** [[Restraining order]] – requires a party to do, or to refrain from doing, certain acts. A party that refuses to comply with an order faces criminal or civil penalties and may have to pay damages or accept sanctions. Breaches of restraining orders can be considered serious criminal offences that merit arrest and possible prison sentences. The term is most commonly used in reference to [[domestic violence]], [[harassment]], [[stalking]] or [[sexual assault]].

===Topics===
* [[Battered woman defense]] – a self-defense measure used in court that the person accused of an [[assault]] / [[murder]] was suffering from ''[[battered person syndrome]]''.
* [[Domestic violence court]] – specialized courts designed to improve victim safety and enhance defendant accountability, created in response to frustration among victim advocates, judges and attorneys who saw the same litigants cycling through the justice system repeatedly.

The [[Associated Press]] (AP) called it "the most infamous brawl in NBA history",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2012/news/04/23/top-10-hits.ap/index.html|title=Top 10 list of worst NBA fights, cheap shots|agency=Associated Press|publisher=National Basketball Association|accessdate=April 20, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528065106/http://www.nba.com/2012/news/04/23/top-10-hits.ap/index.html|archivedate=May 28, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the media has dubbed it the "worst night in NBA history". 

With 45.9 seconds left in the game,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8VYYLO6z6w&lt;/ref&gt; Pistons [[Center (basketball)|center]] [[Ben Wallace]] went up for a layup, but was [[Personal foul (basketball)|fouled]] by Pacers [[small forward]] [[Metta World Peace|Ron Artest]]. Furious for being fouled when the game had already been decided, Wallace pushed Artest. A fight broke out on the court between several players. After the fight was broken up, a fan threw a drink from the stands at Artest while he was lying on the scorer's table. Artest immediately charged after the fan, sparking a massive brawl between players and spectators that stretched from the seats down to the court and lasted several minutes.

After the game, the NBA suspended nine players for a total of 146 games, which led to $11 million in salary being lost by the players. Five players were also charged with assault, and eventually sentenced to a year of probation and community service. Five fans also faced criminal charges and were banned from attending Pistons home games for life. The fight also led the NBA to increase security between players and fans, and to limit the sale of alcohol in games.

==Before the brawl==
The meeting was the first between the two teams since the [[2003–04 NBA season|previous season]]'s [[2004 NBA Playoffs#Conference Finals: (1) Indiana Pacers vs. (3) Detroit Pistons|Eastern Conference Finals]], which the Pistons won in six games en route to their first [[2004 NBA Finals|NBA title]] since the [[Detroit Pistons#1979.E2.80.931994: The Bad Boys era|"Bad Boys" era]] of the late 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2004.html|title=2004 NBA Playoff Summary|work=basketball-reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=September 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused the game to receive much hype from the media and fans. Having won two games in a row, the Pacers came into the game with a 6–2 record, while the Pistons, the defending champions, began their season 4–3. The game was televised nationally on [[NBA on ESPN|ESPN]],&lt;ref name="abrams20120229"/&gt; as well as on the Pacers' and Pistons' local broadcast affiliates, [[Fox Sports Midwest]] and [[WDIV-TV|WDIV]] (Detroit's NBC affiliate), respectively.

The game, like many previous meetings between the two teams, was dominated by defense. The Pacers got off to a quick start, opening up a 20-point lead with seven minutes to go before halftime. The Pistons managed to cut into the lead, trailing by 16 points by halftime. The Pistons opened the third quarter with a 9–2 run, but the Pacers ended it with a buzzer-beating three-pointer and a layup from [[Jamaal Tinsley]] heading into the fourth quarter. [[Richard Hamilton (basketball)|Richard Hamilton]] and [[Lindsey Hunter]] started the last quarter with consecutive three-point field goals, as the Pistons cut into the lead again. But [[Stephen Jackson]]'s back-to-back field goals pushed the lead back to 93–79 with 3:52 remaining, essentially putting the Pistons away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/game_041119.html|title=Big Win Marred by Ugly Brawl|date=November 19, 2004|accessdate=September 27, 2008|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671fUB6NY?url=http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/game_041119.html|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the lopsided score near the end of the game, most key players on both teams remained in the game.&lt;ref name="recap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=241119008|agency=Associated Press|title=Carlisle: 'I was fighting for my life out there'|date=November 19, 2004|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=April 26, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041125092458/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=241119008|archivedate=November 25, 2004|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pacers were led by the 24-point effort of Ron Artest, who scored 17 in the first quarter. [[Jermaine O'Neal]] notched a [[Double (basketball)#Double-double|double-double]] with 20 points and 13 rebounds. Tinsley had 13 points, eight assists and a career-high eight steals. Hamilton led the Pistons with 20 points. [[Rasheed Wallace]] and Ben Wallace both recorded a double-double.

==Altercation==
[[File:Artestpunchoffaninbrawl.PNG|thumb|right|200px|[[Metta World Peace|Ron Artest]] charging into the stands to attack Michael Ryan, who he believed threw a cup at him. The actual person responsible was John Green, the man in the blue shirt to Artest's left.|alt=]]
The brawl began with 45.9&amp;nbsp;seconds remaining in the game, when Indiana led 97–82. Pistons center Ben Wallace was fouled from behind by Pacers small forward Ron Artest, now known as [[Metta World Peace]], who slapped him across the back of the head during a layup attempt. Wallace later said that Artest had warned him he would be hit.&lt;ref name="abrams20120229"/&gt; Wallace responded by shoving Artest in the face with both hands, causing players from both teams to quickly get in between them as they attempted to keep Wallace and Artest separated.&lt;ref name="firstreport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1927380|title=Artest, Jackson charge Palace stands|date=November 21, 2004|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=April 26, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671frX7XJ?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1927380|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="knightridder"&gt;{{cite web|title=FOUL PLAY IN AUBURN HILLS: Pacers in brawl with Palace fans |url=http://www.freep.com/sports/pistons/brawl20e_20041120.htm|work=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=April 17, 2012|date=November 21, 2004|last=Elrick|first=M.

Pistons coach [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] was not yet very concerned, because fights in the NBA rarely lasted for more than a few seconds. During the altercation, Artest lay down on the scorer's table to relax while putting on a headset to speak with Pacers radio broadcaster Mark Boyle. The microphone was not live. Boyle recalled that the broadcasting team knew Artest's personality and "there was no way we were going to put an open mic in front of [him] in that situation". Pacers president [[Donnie Walsh]] later stated that Artest was following advice he had received on how to calm down and avoid trouble in a volatile situation. After unsuccessfully attempting to break up the confrontation, referees prepared to [[ejection (sports)|eject]] various players before the game resumed.{{r|abrams20120229}} Sportscaster [[Mike Breen]], calling the game for ESPN, believed Wallace would be ejected, while [[Bill Walton]] was of the opinion that [[Stephen Jackson]] should be ejected as well, for shouting at the Pistons players and aggravating the situation. However, Breen expressed concern that, if ejected, Wallace would have to walk past the Pacers bench, which could have triggered another incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwvihuoeI8A|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ninety seconds after Wallace shoved Artest, most of both teams' players and coaches were huddled at midcourt, attempting to calm down Wallace{{r|abrams20120229}} ([[Tayshaun Prince]] was the only player on either team to not leave the bench during the entire incident; others became automatically eligible for one-game suspensions).&lt;ref name="mccosky20041129"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2004-11-20-detroit-fans_x.htm|title=Pistons-Pacers brawl spills into the stands|work=USA Today|date=November 20, 2004|accessdate=March 1, 2012|author=McCosky, Chris|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671fyg4Z4?url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/2004-11-20-detroit-fans_x.htm|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Artest was lying on the table, Wallace threw a towel at him, causing Artest to briefly stand up before being held back by coaches.{{r|abrams20120229}}{{r|mccosky20041129}} A spectator, John Green, then threw a plastic cup of [[Diet Coke]] at Artest, hitting him in the chest.&lt;ref name="firstreport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4670842|title=Fan details strides made since brawl|date=November 19, 2009|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=November 19, 2009|quote=Green stated he had been drinking beer, but at the time he threw the drink at Artest he was drinking it. 'I remember throwing the cup, actually a cup of beer, but I had been drinking and I've had issues with alcohol in the past.' He later claimed that he had not intended to hit anyone but 'forgot about the laws of physics.'|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671g4Z3tz?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4670842|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artest jumped off the table, ran into the [[bleacher|stands]], and grabbed a man, Michael Ryan, who he mistakenly believed was responsible. Boyle stood up to try and hold back Artest and was trampled in the effort, suffering five fractured vertebrae and a gouge on his head.&lt;ref name="knightridder"/&gt; Jackson followed Artest into the stands and punched a fan, William Paulson, in the face in retaliation for the man throwing another drink in Artest's face while he was being restrained by other spectators.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; Pacers players [[Eddie Gill]], [[David Harrison (basketball)|David Harrison]], [[Reggie Miller]] (who was not dressed for the game due to injury), [[Fred Jones (basketball)|Fred Jones]], and [[Jamaal Tinsley]], the Pistons' [[Rasheed Wallace]], and numerous personnel (including Pistons radio analyst and former player [[Rick Mahorn]]) also quickly entered the stands to retrieve Artest and Jackson, and to break up the fighting. Green punched Artest twice in the head from behind, as did Ben Wallace's brother, David, to Jones.{{r|abrams20120229}} More fans then began throwing drinks and other objects, while a number of fans spilled out onto the court.&lt;ref name="firstreport"/&gt;

As Artest walked out of the stands, he was confronted by two more fans, Alvin "A.J." Shackleford and Charlie Haddad, who ran onto the court.{{r|abrams20120229}} Artest punched Shackleford in the face, causing Haddad to intervene by pushing away Artest, before both fans fell over. While Haddad was on the floor, [[Anthony Johnson (basketball)|Anthony Johnson]] struck him in the back of the head. As Haddad stood up, [[Jermaine O'Neal]] punched him in the jaw after a running start,&lt;ref name="firstreport"/&gt; while slipping in liquid and falling backwards, causing witnesses [[Scot Pollard]], ESPN sideline reporter [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]], and a Pistons executive, Tom Wilson, to briefly fear that O'Neal would kill Haddad. O'Neal later claimed that Haddad had been asked to leave the arena earlier that night, and was well-known to security because of claims that he wanted to fight an NBA player in order to receive compensation. [[William Wesley]], [[Austin Croshere]], and Miller pulled Artest away from the fans,{{r|abrams20120229}} but the scene became chaotic as outnumbered arena security struggled to reestablish order. Although [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]] police had plans to handle many disorders, and had three officers in the arena, they were unprepared for players entering the stands.{{r|abrams20120229}}&lt;ref name="firstreport"/&gt;

Pacers coach [[Rick Carlisle]] said after the game, "I felt like I was fighting for my life out there."  One reporter who attempted to stop Tinsley from entering the stands recalled that the player "went through me like I was butter", and then [[Commissioner of the NBA|NBA Commissioner]] [[David Stern]], watching the game on TV, recalled that he said, "Holy [''mouths a swear word'']." (O'Neal later said, "As bad as it looked on TV, it was at least 20 times worse in person.") Pacers assistant coach [[Chuck Person]] compared the situation to being "trapped in a gladiator-type scene where the fans were the lions and we were just trying to escape with our lives. That's how it felt. That there was no exit. That you had to fight your way out." Players' children and others in the audience cried from fear and shock. [[Derrick Coleman]] stood near Brown and Brown's [[ball boy]] son to protect them.{{r|abrams20120229}} The remaining seconds of the game were called off and the Pacers were awarded the 97–82 win.&lt;ref name="recap"/&gt; Fans booed the Indiana players as they were escorted from the court by officials and security, and continued to throw beverages and other objects (including a [[folding chair]] that nearly hit O'Neal) at them as they walked under the tunnel to the locker room.{{r|abrams20120229}}&lt;ref name="knightridder"/&gt; A replay on ESPN's broadcast showed Larry Brown attempting to talk to the fans over the loudspeaker of the arena in an attempt to stop the debacle, but Brown threw the microphone down in disgust after the microphone failed to work. No players from either team spoke to the media before leaving the arena. Eventually, police officers were able to swarm the arena, threatening to handcuff those who wouldn't leave.&lt;ref name="knightridder"/&gt; Nine spectators were injured, and two were taken to the hospital.&lt;ref name="indefinitely"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1927663|title=Artest, O'Neal, Jackson, Wallace on hook|date=November 20, 2004|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=May 3, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671gMQKyW?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1927663|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Pacers' locker room, O'Neal and Carlisle nearly got into a fight over the coaches trying to restrain the players when they were defending themselves.{{r|abrams20120229}} Artest asked Jackson whether he thought the players would get in trouble. Jackson responded, "We'll be lucky if we have a freaking job." The conversation convinced an amazed Jackson and Pollard that Artest "wasn't in his right mind, to ask that question".{{r|abrams20120229}}{{r|medina20120926}} Auburn Hills police entered the locker room to make arrests, but the team rushed Artest onto the bus and refused to take him off. The police decided to protect the Pacers as they left the arena and to later contact the team after reviewing game film.{{r|abrams20120229}} Outside of the arena, there were dozens of [[Police car|police cruiser]]s lining the roads out of the parking lots.&lt;ref name="knightridder"/&gt;

===Suspensions===
On November 20, 2004, the NBA suspended Artest, Jackson, O'Neal, and Wallace indefinitely,&lt;ref name="indefinitely"/&gt; saying that their actions were "shocking, repulsive, and inexcusable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/news/commissioner_statement_041120.html|title=Statement from NBA Commissioner David Stern Concerning the Altercation During the Detroit Pistons and Indiana Pacers Game Last Night at The Palace of Auburn Hills|date=November 20, 2004|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|accessdate=May 17, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671gRzjeJ?url=http://www.nba.com/news/commissioner_statement_041120.html|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the NBA announced that nine players would be suspended for a total of what eventually became 146 games–137 games for Pacers players and nine games for Pistons players.&lt;ref name="suspensions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1928540|title=Suspensions without pay, won't be staggered|date=November 21, 2004|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=May 3, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671gZ3vqo?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1928540|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Harrison (basketball)|David Harrison]] was also seen fighting with fans, but the NBA stated that he wouldn't be suspended because "the incident occurred as the players were attempting to leave the floor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1930077|title=Union director suggests 35-game maximum|date=November 28, 2004|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=May 3, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671geT8kp?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1930077|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artest was given the longest suspension; he was suspended for the remainder of the [[2004–05 NBA season]], a suspension that eventually totaled 86&amp;nbsp;games (73 regular season and 13 subsequent playoff games), the [[List of people banned or suspended by the NBA|longest suspension]] for an on-court incident in NBA history.&lt;ref name="suspensions"/&gt; The players suspended also lost in excess of $11&amp;nbsp;million in salary due to the suspensions, with Artest alone losing almost $5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="infamy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/10089645/site/21683474/|title=Palace brawl lives in infamy 1 year later|date=November 26, 2005|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=May 16, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671gn543Q?url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/10089645/site/21683474/|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the week following the announcement of the suspensions, the [[National Basketball Players Association|players' union]] appealed the suspensions of Artest, Jackson, and O'Neal, saying they thought that commissioner Stern had "exceeded his authority".&lt;ref name="suspensions"/&gt; (Jackson felt that despite losing millions the players were fortunate, however, as Stern could have expelled them from the league.{{r|abrams20120229}}) A federal arbitrator upheld the full length of all suspensions, except that of O'Neal, which was reduced to 15 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E3DB1130F930A15751C1A9629C8B63|title=N.B.A. Seeks to Overturn Arbitrator's Shorter Ban for O'Neal|last=Robbins|first=Liz|date=December 23, 2004|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 3, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671ha0Ino?url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E3DB1130F930A15751C1A9629C8B63|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the NBA appealed the decision of the arbitrator to reduce O'Neal's suspension in federal court, and on December 24, a judge issued a temporary injunction allowing O'Neal to play, until a full hearing was held on the NBA's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1952624|title=Final decision expected Dec. 30|date=December 24, 2004|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=May 3, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671hgduwC?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1952624|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Neal played in two more games before the NBA's case was brought before the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York|U.S. District Court]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York on December 30. The NBA argued that under the terms of the [[NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement|Collective Bargaining Agreement]] (CBA), Stern had absolute authority to hand out suspensions and hear appeals for all on-court incidents. But the judge ruled that because O'Neal's behavior was an off-court incident, arbitration was allowed under the CBA, and thus the arbitrator was within his rights to reduce the suspension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1955959|title=Judge: Arbitrator had right to shorten penalty|date=December 30, 2004|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=May 16, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/671hlw8hl?url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1955959|archivedate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite O'Neal's successful appeal, no further appeals were made to reduce Artest's and Jackson's suspensions.

The Pacers have attempted to rebuild by obtaining "character guys" as players.{{r|abrams20120229}}

On November 19, 2009, John Green, one of the fans who helped begin the brawl, appeared on ''[[First Take (TV series)|ESPN First Take]]'', where he talked about the incident and the changes he had made since then. Green recounted that he had an alcohol problem at the time and had since made an effort to deal with that. He also said that Ron Artest had apologized to him several months earlier, and wished to work together in some type of community service in Detroit.&lt;ref name="John Green"/&gt;

In [[literature]], the '''paradox''' is an anomalous juxtaposition of incongruous ideas for the sake of striking exposition or unexpected insight. It functions as a method of literary composition and analysis that involves examining apparently contradictory statements and drawing conclusions either to reconcile them or to explain their presence.&lt;ref&gt;Rescher, Nicholas. ''Paradoxes: Their Roots, Range, and Resolution''. Open Court: Chicago, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary or rhetorical paradoxes abound in the works of [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[G. K. Chesterton]]. Most literature deals with paradox of situation;  [[Rabelais]], [[Cervantes]], [[Laurence Sterne|Sterne]], [[Borges]], and Chesterton are recognized as masters of situation as well as verbal paradox. Statements such as Wilde's "I can resist anything except temptation" and Chesterton's "spies do not look like spies"&lt;ref name="tallstory"&gt;From "A Tall Story" in ''[[The Paradoxes of Mr. Pond]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; are examples of rhetorical paradox.  Further back, [[Polonius]]' observation that "though this be madness, yet there is method in't" is a memorable third.&lt;ref name="tallstory" /&gt; Also, statements that are illogical and metaphoric may be called paradoxes, for example: "The pike flew to the tree to sing." The literal meaning is illogical, but there are many interpretations for this metaphor.

==Cleanth Brooks' "Language of Paradox"==
[[Cleanth Brooks]], an active member of the [[New Criticism|New Critical]] movement, outlines the use of reading poems through paradox as a method of critical interpretation. Paradox in poetry means that tension at the surface of a verse can lead to apparent [[contradiction]]s and [[Hypocrisy|hypocrisies]]. Brooks' seminal essay, ''The Language of Paradox'', lays out his argument for the centrality of paradox by demonstrating that paradox is "the language appropriate and inevitable to poetry."&lt;ref&gt;''Literary Theory: An Anthology'', 2nd Ed., Eds. Julie Rivkin and Michael Ryan.&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is based on the contention that referential language is too vague for the specific message a poet expresses; he must "make up his language as he goes." This, Brooks argues, is because words are mutable and meaning shifts when words are placed in relation to one another.&lt;ref name="well wrought"&gt;Brooks, Cleanth. ''[[The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry]]''. New York: Reynal &amp; Hitchcock, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the writing of poems, paradox is used as a method by which unlikely comparisons can be drawn and meaning can be extracted from poems both straightforward and enigmatic.

Brooks points to [[William Wordsworth]]'s poem ''It is a beauteous evening, calm and free''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=It is a beauteous evening, calm and free |url=http://www.bartelby.org/145/ww211.html |author=William Wordsworth |authorlink=William Wordsworth |publisher=Bartelby dot org |year=1802 |access-date=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He begins by outlining the initial and surface conflict, which is that the speaker is filled with worship, while his female companion does not seem to be. The paradox, discovered by the poem's end, is that the girl is more full of worship than the speaker precisely because she is always consumed with sympathy for nature and not – as is the speaker – in tune with nature while immersed in it.

In his reading of Wordsworth's poem, [[Composed upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802|"Composed upon Westminster Bridge"]], Brooks contends that the poem offers paradox not in its details, but in the situation the speaker creates. Though [[London]] is a man-made marvel, and in many respects in opposition to nature, the speaker does not view London as a mechanical and artificial landscape but as a landscape composed entirely of nature. Since London was created by man, and man is a part of nature, London is thus too a part of nature. It is this reason that gives the speaker the opportunity to remark upon the beauty of London as he would a natural phenomenon, and, as Brooks points out, can call the houses "sleeping" rather than "dead" because they too are vivified with the natural spark of life, granted to them by the men that built them.

Brooks ends his essay with a reading of [[John Donne]]'s poem ''[[The Canonization]]'', which uses a paradox as its underlying [[metaphor]]. Using a charged religious term to describe the speaker's physical love as saintly, Donne effectively argues that in rejecting the material world and withdrawing to a world of each other, the two lovers are appropriate candidates for canonization. This seems to parody both love and religion, but in fact it combines them, pairing unlikely circumstances and demonstrating their resulting complex meaning. Brooks points also to secondary paradoxes in the poem: the simultaneous duality and singleness of love, and the double and contradictory meanings of "die" in Metaphysical poetry (used here as both sexual union and literal death). He contends that these several meanings are impossible to convey at the right depth and emotion in any language but that of paradox. A similar paradox is used in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', when Juliet says, "For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch and palm to palm is holy palmer's kiss."

Brooks' contemporaries in the sciences were, in the 1940s and 50's, reorganizing university science curricula into codified disciplines. The study of English, however, remained less defined and it became a goal of the New Critical movement to justify literature in an age of science by separating the work from its author and critic (see Wimsatt and Beardsley's [[Intentional fallacy]] and [[Affective fallacy]]) and by examining it as a self-sufficient artifact. In Brooks's use of the paradox as a tool for analysis, however, he develops a logical case as a literary technique with strong emotional effect. His reading of "The Canonization" in ''The Language of Paradox'', where paradox becomes central to expressing complicated ideas of sacred and secular love, provides an example of this development.&lt;ref name="well wrought" /&gt;

==Paradox and irony==
Although paradox and irony as New Critical tools for reading poetry are often conflated, they are independent poetical devices. Irony for [[Cleanth Brooks|Brooks]] is "the obvious warping of a statement by the context"&lt;ref name="irony"&gt;Brooks, Cleanth. "Irony as a Principle of Structure." In ''Critical Theory Since Plato'', edited by Hazard Adams. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas paradox is later glossed as a special kind of qualification that "involves the resolution of opposites."&lt;ref name="Crane"&gt;Crane, R.S. "Cleanth Brooks; Or, The Bankruptcy of Critical Monism." In ''Modern Philology'', Vol. 45, No. 4 (May 1948) pp 226-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irony functions as a presence in the text – the overriding context of the surrounding words that make up the poem. Only sentences such as 2 + 2 = 4 are free from irony; most other statements are prey to their immediate context and are altered by it (take, as an example, the following joke. "A woman walks into a bar and asks for a ''[[double entendre]]''. The bartender gives it to her." This last statement, perfectly acceptable elsewhere, is transformed by its context in the joke to an innuendo). Irony is the key to validating the poem because a test of any statement grows from the context – validating a statement demands examining the statement in the context of the poem and determining whether it is appropriate to that context.&lt;ref name="irony" /&gt;

Paradox, however, is essential to the structure and being of the poem. In ''The Well Wrought Urn'' Brooks shows that paradox was so essential to poetic meaning that paradox was almost identical to poetry. According to literary theorist Leroy Searle, Brooks' use of paradox emphasized the indeterminate lines between form and content.  "The form of the poem uniquely embodies its meaning," and the language of the poem "affects the reconciliation of opposites or contraries." While irony functions within the poem, paradox often refers to the meaning and structure of the poem and is thus inclusive of irony.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, Leroy. "New Criticism." In ''The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism'', 2nd edition.  Edited by Michael Groden, Martin Kreiswirth, and [[Imre Szeman]]. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This existence of opposites or contraries and the reconciliation thereof is poetry and the meaning of the poem.

==Criticism==
R.S. Crane, in his essay ''The Critical Monism of Cleanth Brooks'', argues strongly against Brooks' centrality of paradox. For one, Brooks believes that the very structure of poetry is paradox, and ignores the other subtleties of imagination and power that poets bring to their poems. Brooks simply believed that, "'Imagination' reveals itself in the balance or reconciliation of opposite or discordant qualities."&lt;ref name="Crane" /&gt;  Brooks, in leaning on the crutch of paradox, only discusses the truth poetry can reveal, and speaks nothing about the pleasure it can give. (231) Also, by defining poetry as uniquely having a structure of paradox, Brooks ignores the power of paradox in everyday conversation and discourse, including scientific discourse, which Brooks claimed was opposed to poetry. Crane claims that, using Brooks' definition of poetry, the most powerful paradoxical poem in modern history is Einstein's formula [[Mass-energy equivalence|E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], which is a profound paradox in that matter and energy are the same thing. The argument for the centrality of paradox (and irony) becomes a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' and is therefore void (or at least ineffective) for literary analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9454">In [[United States Constitution|U.S. constitutional law]], '''rational basis review''' is the normal [[standard of review]] that courts apply when considering constitutional questions, including [[Due Process of Law|due process]] or [[Equal Protection|equal protection]] questions under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] or [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Courts applying rational basis review seek to determine whether a law  is "rationally related" to a "legitimate"  government interest, whether real or hypothetical.&lt;ref name="law.cornell"&gt;"[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/rational_basis Rational Basis.]" Cornell University Law School. Web. 26 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The higher levels of scrutiny are [[intermediate scrutiny]] and [[strict scrutiny]]. Heightened scrutiny is applied where a [[suspect classification|suspect or quasi-suspect classification]] is involved, or a [[Fundamental right#American Constitutional Law|fundamental right]] is implicated.&lt;ref name="law.cornell" /&gt;

In United States Supreme Court jurisprudence, the nature of the interest at issue determines the level of scrutiny applied by appellate courts. When courts engage in rational basis review, only the most egregious enactments, those not rationally related to a legitimate government interest, are overturned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mayo v. Wisconsin Injured Patients &amp; Families Compensation Fund, 2018 WI 78, ___ Wis. 2d ___, ___ NW2d ___, |pages=78 |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Rational+Basis+Test Rational Basis Test.]" The Free Dictionary.

Web. 26 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Rational basis review tests whether the government's actions are "rationally related" to a "legitimate" government interest.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'', 304 U.S. 144 (1938).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/emma-rubysachs/equal-potection-in-florid_b_147325.html |work=Huffington Post |title=Equal Protection in Florida |date=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court has never set forth standards for determining what constitutes a legitimate government interest.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Nollan v. California Coastal Commission]]'', 483 U.S. 825, 834 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Under rational basis review, it is "entirely irrelevant" what end the government is actually seeking and statutes can be based on "rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data."&lt;ref&gt;''FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc''. 508 U.S. 307, 315 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, if the court can merely hypothesize a "legitimate" interest served by the challenged action, it will withstand rational basis review.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Kathleen M. &amp; Gunther Gerald. ''Constitutional Law''. Foundation Press, New York, NY. 16th Ed. Chapter 9 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Judges following the Supreme Court's instructions understand themselves to be "obligated to seek out other conceivable reasons for validating" challenged laws if the government is unable to justify its own policies.&lt;ref&gt;''Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto'', 253 F.3d 137, 146 (1st Cir.2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of rational basis review can be traced to an influential 1893 article, "The Origin and Scope of American Constitutional Law," by Harvard law professor [[James Bradley Thayer]]. Thayer argued that statutes should be invalidated only if their unconstitutionality is "so clear that it is not open to rational question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posner |first1=Richard A.|title=The Rise and Fall of Judicial Self-Restraint|journal=California Law Review|date=2012|volume=100|issue=3|pages=519, 522|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=californialawreview|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], a student of Thayer's, articulated a version of what would become rational basis review in his canonical dissent in ''[[Lochner v. New York]]'', arguing that "the word 'liberty,' in the 14th Amendment, is perverted when it is held to prevent the natural outcome of a dominant opinion, unless it can be said that a rational and fair man necessarily would admit that the statute proposed would infringe fundamental principles as they have been understood by the traditions of our people and our law."

However, the court's extensive application of economic substantive due process during [[Lochner era|the years following Lochner]] meant that Holmes' proposed doctrine of judicial deference to state interest was not immediately adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Indest, Miles O. "Walking Dead: The Fifth Circuit Resurrects Rational Basis Review." ''Tulane Law Review'' 88.5 (2014): 993–1005. Web. 26 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until ''[[Nebbia v. New York]]'' that the Court began to formally apply rational basis review, when it stated that "a State is free to adopt whatever economic policy may reasonably be deemed to promote public welfare, and to enforce that policy by legislation adapted to its purpose." In ''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' the Court in [[Footnote Four]] left open the possibility that laws that seem to be within "a specific prohibition of the Constitution," which restrict the political process, or which burden "[[discrete and insular minorities]]" might receive more exacting review. Today, such laws receive [[strict scrutiny]], whereas laws implicating  [[unenumerated rights]] that the Supreme Court has not recognized as [[fundamental rights|fundamental]] receive rational basis review.

==Applicability==
In modern constitutional law, the rational basis test is applied to constitutional challenges of both [[federal law]] and [[state law]] (via the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]).  This test also applies to both [[legislature|legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] action whether those actions be of a [[substantive due process|substantive]] or [[procedural due process|procedural]] nature.

The rational basis test prohibits the government from imposing restrictions on liberty that are irrational or arbitrary, or drawing distinctions between persons in a manner that serves no constitutionally legitimate end.&lt;ref&gt;Killian, Johnny H., George A. Costello, &amp; Kenneth R. Thomas, co-eds., ''The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002'', by [[Congressional Research Service]], [[Library of Congress]] (Senate Document No. 108-17, 108th Congress, 2d Session) (Washington [D.C.]: U.S. Gov't Printing Ofc. 2004) (short title: ''[[Congressional Research Service reports#How to access CRS Reports|Constitution Annotated]]''), pp. 1906–1910 (pp. 242–246 per Adobe Acrobat Reader) ([http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/pdf2002/032.pdf ''Fourteenth Amendment''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810025118/http://www.gpoaccess.gov//constitution/pdf2002/032.pdf |date=2010-08-10 }}, [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/pdf2002/001-Title.pdf title page (p. [I&amp;#93; (p. 1 per Adobe Acrobat Reader))] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331232402/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/pdf2002/001-Title.pdf |date=2010-03-31 }}, and [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/constitution/pdf2002/002-Authorization.pdf ''Authorization'' (authorization to publish by joint resolution) (giving short title) (p. III) (p. 1 per Adobe Acrobat Reader)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810024512/http://www.gpoaccess.gov//constitution/pdf2002/002-Authorization.pdf |date=2010-08-10 }}, all as accessed October 23, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; While a "law enacted for broad and ambitious purposes often can be explained by reference to legitimate public policies which justify the incidental disadvantages they impose on certain persons", it must nevertheless, at least, "bear a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', 517 U.S. 620 (1996) at 635&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the concept of rational basis review, it is easier to understand what it is not. Rational basis review is ''not'' a genuine effort to determine the legislature's actual reasons for enacting a statute, nor to inquire into whether a statute does in fact further a legitimate end of government. A court applying rational basis review will virtually always uphold a challenged law unless every conceivable justification for it is a grossly illogical non sequitur. In 2008, Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] reaffirmed the lenient nature of rational basis review in a [[concurring opinion]]: "[A]s I recall my esteemed former colleague, [[Thurgood Marshall]], remarking on numerous occasions: 'The Constitution does not prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws.'"&lt;ref&gt;''New York State Bd. of Elections v. Lopez Torres'', 552 U.S. 196, ___ (2008) (Stevens, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sense of agency''' ('''SA'''), or '''sense of control''', is the [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[awareness]] of initiating, executing, and controlling one's own [[volition (psychology)|volition]]al actions in the world.&lt;ref name=JeannerodBBR03&gt;Jeannerod, M. (2003). The mechanism of self-recognition in human. Behavioural Brain Research, 142, 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the pre-reflective awareness or implicit sense that it is I who is executing bodily movement(s) or thinking thoughts. In normal, non-pathological experience, the SA is tightly integrated with one's "[[sense of ownership]]" (SO), which is the [[pre-reflective awareness]] or [[implicit sense]] that one is the owner of an action, movement or thought. If someone else were to move your arm (while you remained passive) you would certainly have sensed that it were your arm that moved and thus a sense of ownership (SO) for that movement. However, you would not have felt that you were the author of the movement; you would not have a sense of agency (SA).&lt;ref name=GallagherTICS00&gt;Gallagher, S. (2000). Philosophical conceptions of the self: implications for cognitive science. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4, 14–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally SA and SO are tightly integrated, such that while typing one has an enduring, embodied, and tacit sense that "my own fingers are doing the moving" (SO) ''and'' that "the typing movements are controlled (or volitionally directed) by me" (SA). In patients suffering from certain forms of pathological experience (i.e., [[schizophrenia]]) the integration of SA and SO may become disrupted in some manner. In this case, movements may be executed or thoughts made manifest, for which the schizophrenic patient has a sense of ownership, but not a sense of agency.{{citation needed lead|date=September 2014}}

Regarding SA for both motor movements and thoughts, further distinctions may be found in both first-order (immediate, pre-reflective) experience&lt;ref&gt;Tsakiris M, Schütz-Bosbach S, Gallagher S (2007) On agency and body-ownership: phenomenological and neurocognitive reflections. Conscious Cogn 16:645–660&lt;/ref&gt; and higher-order (reflective or introspective) consciousness.&lt;ref name=StephensGraham00&gt;Stephens, G. L., &amp; Graham, G. (2000). ''When self-consciousness breaks: Alien voices and inserted thoughts''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}} For example, while typing I have a sense of control and thus SA for the ongoing action of typing; this is an example of SA in first-order experience which is immediate and prior to any explicit intellectual reflection upon the typing actions ''themselves''. In this case, I am not focusing on the typing movements ''per se'' but rather, I am involved with the task at hand.  If I'm subsequently asked if I just performed the action of typing, I can correctly attribute agency to myself. This is an example of a higher-order, reflective, conscious "attribution" of agency, which is a derivative notion stemming from the immediate, ''pre''-reflective "sense" of agency.

==Definition==
The concept of [[agency (philosophy)|agency]] implies an active organism, one who desires, makes plans, and carries out actions.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M. (1990). Intention, consciousness, desires and development. Psychological Inquiry, 1, 278–283.&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of agency plays a pivotal role in cognitive development, including the first stage of self-awareness (or pre-theoretical experience of one's own mentality), which scaffolds [[theory of mind]] capacities.&lt;ref name=Rochat99&gt;Rochat, P. (1999). Early Social Cognition: Understanding Others in the First Months of Life. Mahawah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}} Indeed, the ability to recognize oneself as the agent of a behavior is the way the self builds as an entity independent from the external world.&lt;ref name=JeannerodBBR03/&gt; The sense of agency and its scientific study has important implications in [[social cognition]], [[moral reasoning]], and [[psychopathology]]. The conceptual distinction between SA and SO was defined by philosopher and phenomenologist [[Shaun Gallagher]].&lt;ref name=GallagherTICS00/&gt; Using a different terminology, essentially the same distinction has been made by John Campbell,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, John (1999): "Schizophrenia, the Space of Reasons, and Thinking as a Motor Process." Monist 82 (4), 609–625.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lynn Stephens and George Graham.&lt;ref name=StephensGraham00/&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}}

==Neuroscience==
A number of experiments in normal individuals has been undertaken in order to determine the functional anatomy of the sense of agency. These experiments have consistently documented the role of the posterior [[parietal cortex]] as a critical link within the simulation network for self-recognition. Primary sources have reported that activation of the right inferior parietal lobe/temporoparietal junction correlates with the subjective sense of ownership in action execution,&lt;ref&gt;Farrer, C., Franck, N., Georgieff, N., Frith, C. D., Decety, J., &amp; Jeannerod, M. (2003). Modulating the experience of agency: a positron emission tomography study. NeuroImage 18, 324–333.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, P., &amp; Decety, J. (2001). Effect of subjective perspective taking during simulation of action: A PET investigation of agency. Nature Neuroscience 4, 546–550.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}and that posterior parietal lesions, especially on the right side, impair the ability of recognizing one's own body parts and self-attributing one's own movements.&lt;ref&gt;Daprati, E., et al. (2000). Recognition of self produced movement in a case of severe neglect. Neurocase, 6, 477–486{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

Accumulating evidence from [[functional neuroimaging]] studies, as well as lesion studies in neurological patients indicates that the right inferior [[parietal cortex]], at the junction with the posterior temporal cortex (TPJ, temporoparietal junction), plays a critical role in the distinction between self-produced actions and actions perceived in others.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, P.L., &amp; Decety, J. (2004). Motor cognition: A new paradigm to study self other interactions. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 14, 259–263.&lt;/ref&gt; Lesions of this region can produce a variety of disorders associated with body knowledge and self-awareness such as [[anosognosia]], [[asomatognosia]], or [[somatoparaphrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Berlucchi, G., &amp; Aglioti, S. (1997). The body in the brain: neural bases of corporeal awareness. Trends in Neurosciences, 20, 560–564.&lt;/ref&gt;  A primary source has reported that electrical stimulation of the TPJ can elicit out-of-body experiences (i.e., the experience of dissociation of self from the body).&lt;ref&gt;Blanke, O., &amp; Arzy, S. (2005). The out-of-body experience: Disturbed self-processing at the temporo-parietal junction. Neuroscientist, 11, 16–24.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

The investigation of the neural correlates of reciprocal [[imitation]] is extremely important because it provides an ecological paradigm (a situation close to everyday life) to address the issue of the sense of agency.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Sommerville, J.A. (2003). Shared representations between self and others: A social cognitive neuroscience view. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7, 527–533.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that reciprocal imitation plays a constitutive role in the early development of an implicit sense of self as a social agent.&lt;ref name=Rochat99/&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}}

A primary source has reported a [[functional neuroimaging]] experiment, where participants were scanned while they imitated an experimenter performing constructions with small objects and while the experimenter, while performing such a manipulation, imitated the participants. Across both conditions, the participants' sense of ownership (the sense that it is I who am experiencing the movement or thought) as well as the visual and [[somatosensory]] inputs were similar or coincided. What differed between imitating and being imitated was the agent who initiated the action. The primary source reports that several key regions were involved in the two conditions of reciprocal imitation compared to a control condition (in which subjects acted differently from the experimenter), namely in the superior temporal sulcus, the temporoparietal cortex (TPJ), and the medial prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., Chaminade, T., Grèzes, J. and Meltzoff, A.N. (2002). A PET exploration of the neural mechanisms involved in reciprocal imitation. Neuroimage 15, 265–272.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

Another approach to understanding the neuroscientific underpinnings of the sense of agency is to examine clinical conditions in which purposeful limb movement occurs ''without'' an associated sense of agency.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The most clear clinical demonstration of this situation is [[alien hand syndrome]]. In this condition, associated with specific forms of brain damage, the affected individual loses the sense of agency without losing a sense of ownership of the affected body part.

==Agency and psychopathology==
[[Marc Jeannerod]] proposed that the process of self-recognition operates covertly and effortlessly. It depends upon a set of mechanisms involving the processing of specific neural signals, from sensory as well as from central origin. Researchers have used experimental situations, in both healthy participants and schizophrenic patients, where these signals can be dissociated from each other and where self-recognition becomes ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Jeannerod, M. (2008). The sense of agency and its disturbances in schizophrenia: a reappraisal. Experimental Brain Research{{full citation needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2014}} These situations reveal that there are two levels of self-recognition, an automatic level for action identification, and a conscious level for the sense of agency, which both rely on the same principle of congruence of the action-related signals.

Investigation of the sense of agency is important to explain positive symptoms of [[schizophrenia]], like thought insertion and delusions of control.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The core of the problem met by these patients is a disturbance of their sense of agency: the first rank symptoms, which represent one of the major features of the disease, are nothing but a loss of the ability to attribute their own thoughts, internal speech, covert or overt actions to themselves.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Nonattributed or misattributed thoughts and actions then become a material for delusional interpretation and delirium.&lt;ref&gt;Farrer, C., Franck, N., Frith, C.D., Decety, J., Damato, T., &amp; Jeannerod, M. (2004). Neural correlates of action attribution in schizophrenia. Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging, 131, 31–44.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}} One primary source reports that the feeling of alien control (i.e., delusions of control) during a movement task in schizophrenic patients is associated with an increased metabolic activity in the right inferior parietal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, S.A., et al. (1997). A PET study of voluntary movement in schizophrenic patients experiencing passivity phenomena. Brain, 120, 1997–2011.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

==Other aspects of agency==
While the conception of human agency is often confined to its exercise by individuals, [[Albert Bandura]] has argued that individuals often do not have direct control over social conditions or institutional practices that affect their lives; in these circumstances, well-being and security are sought through exercise of proxy agency.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1997). Self-efficacy: The exercise of control. New York: Freeman.{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}} For instance, individuals in such circumstances may attempt to persuade others who have expertise, influence, or power to act on their behalf to achieve the outcomes they desire.

Sense of agency has been argued as a prerequisite for human [[morality|moral responsibility]] insofar as self agency underlies the expectation that individuals can be held responsible for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., see Kahn, P.H. (1992). Obligatory and discretionary moral judgments. Child Development, 63, 416–430.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

'''Shaping''' is a [[Operant conditioning|conditioning]] paradigm used primarily in the [[experimental analysis of behavior]]. The method used is [[differential reinforcement]] of '''successive approximations'''. It was introduced by [[B. F. Skinner]]&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, G.B. (2004) [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1285014 A day of great illumination: B.F. Skinner's discovery of shaping.] ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', 82: 317–28&lt;/ref&gt; with pigeons and extended to dogs, dolphins, humans and other species. In shaping, the form of an existing response is gradually changed across successive trials towards a desired target behavior by rewarding exact segments of behavior. Skinner's explanation of shaping was this:
{{quote|We first give the bird food when it turns slightly in the direction of the spot from any part of the cage. This increases the frequency of such behavior. We then withhold reinforcement until a slight movement is made toward the spot. This again alters the general distribution of behavior without producing a new unit. We continue by reinforcing positions successively closer to the spot, then by reinforcing only when the head is moved slightly forward, and finally only when the beak actually makes contact with the spot. ... The original probability of the response in its final form is very low; in some cases it may even be zero. In this way we can build complicated operants which would never appear in the repertoire of the organism otherwise. By reinforcing a series of successive approximations, we bring a rare response to a very high probability in a short time. ... The total act of turning toward the spot from any point in the box, walking toward it, raising the head, and striking the spot may seem to be a functionally coherent unit of behavior; but it is constructed by a continual process of differential reinforcement from undifferentiated behavior, just as the sculptor shapes his figure from a lump of clay.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1953). ''Science and human behavior''. pp. 92–3. Oxford, England: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Successive approximations==
The successive approximations reinforced are increasingly accurate approximations of a response desired by a trainer, the "target" response. As training progresses the trainer stops reinforcing the less accurate approximations. For example, in training a rat to press a lever, the following successive approximations might be reinforced:
# simply turning toward the lever will be reinforced
# only moving toward the lever will be reinforced
# only moving to within a specified distance from the lever will be reinforced
# only touching the lever with any part of the body, such as the nose, will be reinforced
# only touching the lever with a specified paw will be reinforced
# only depressing the lever partially with the specified paw will be reinforced
# only depressing the lever completely with the specified paw will be reinforced

The trainer starts by reinforcing all behaviors in the first category, here turning toward the lever. When the animal regularly performs that response (turning), the trainer restricts reinforcement to responses in the second category (moving toward), then the third, and so on, progressing to each more accurate approximation as the animal learns the one currently reinforced. Thus, the response gradually approximates the desired behavior until finally the target response (lever pressing) is established. At first the rat is not likely to press the lever; in the end it presses rapidly. 

Shaping sometimes fails. An oft-cited example is an attempt by Marian and Keller Breland (students of B.F. Skinner) to shape a pig and a raccoon to deposit a coin in a piggy bank, using food as the reinforcer.  Instead of learning to deposit the coin, the pig began to root it into the ground, and the raccoon "washed" and rubbed the coins together.  That is, the animals treated the coin the same way that they treated food items that they were preparing to eat, referred to as “food-getting” behaviors. In the case of the raccoon, it was able to learn to deposit one coin into the box to gain a food reward, but when the contingencies were changed such that two coins were required to gain the reward, the raccoon could not learn the new, more complex rule. After what could be characterized as expressions of frustration, the raccoon resorts to basic “food-getting” behaviors common to its species. These results show a limitation in the raccoon’s cognitive capacity to even conceive of the possibility that two coins could be exchanged for food, irrespective of existing auto-shaping contingencies. Since the Breland's observations were reported many other examples of untrained responses to natural stimuli have been reported; in many contexts, the stimuli are called "sign stimuli", and the related behaviors are called "sign tracking". &lt;ref&gt;Shettleworth, Sara J. (2010)  "Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior" (2nd Ed) Oxford: New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Learning and Behavior|author1=Powell, R.|author2=Symbaluk, D.|author3=Honey, P.|date=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9780495595281|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WkF8B-Ovl50C&amp;pg=PA430|page=430|accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical applications==
Shaping is used in  training [[operant conditioning|operant responses]] in lab animals, and in [[applied behavior analysis]] to change human or animal behaviors considered to be maladaptive or dysfunctional. It also plays an important role in commercial animal training. Shaping assists in "discrimination", which is the ability to tell the difference between stimuli that are and are not reinforced, and in "generalization", which is the application of a response learned in one situation to a different but similar situation.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Engler: ''Personality Theories''&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaping can also be used in a [[physical therapy|rehabilitation]] center. For example, training on parallel bars can approximate walking with a [[walker (mobility)|walker]].&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. (2012). ''Behavior modification, principles and procedures''. (5th ed.). Wadsworth Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Or shaping can teach patients how to increase the time between bathroom visits.

==Autoshaping==
'''Autoshaping''' (sometimes called '''sign tracking''') is any of a variety of experimental procedures used to study [[classical conditioning]]. In autoshaping, in contrast to shaping, the reward comes irrespective of the behavior of the animal. In its simplest form, autoshaping is very similar to [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s salivary conditioning procedure using dogs. In Pavlov's best-known procedure, a short audible tone reliably preceded the presentation of food to dogs. The dogs naturally, unconditionally, salivated ([[classical conditioning|unconditioned response]]) to the food ([[unconditioned stimulus]]) given to them, but through learning, conditionally, came to salivate ([[conditioned response]]) to the tone ([[conditioned stimulus]]) that predicted food. In auto-shaping, a light is reliably turned on shortly before animals are given food. The animals naturally, unconditionally, display consummatory reactions to the food given them, but through learning, conditionally, came to perform those same consummatory actions directed at the conditioned stimulus that predicts food.

Autoshaping provides an interesting conundrum for [[B.F. Skinner]]'s assertion that one must employ shaping as a method for teaching a pigeon to peck a key. After all, if an animal can shape itself, why use the laborious process of shaping? Autoshaping also contradicts Skinner's principle of reinforcement. During autoshaping, food comes irrespective of the behavior of the animal. If reinforcement were occurring, random behaviors should increase in frequency because they should have been rewarded by random food. Nonetheless, key-pecking reliably develops in pigeons,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, P. &amp; Jenkins, H.M. (1968). Auto-shaping of the pigeon's key peck. ''J. Exper. Analys. Behav.'' 11: 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt; even if this behavior had never been rewarded.

But, the clearest evidence that auto-shaping is under Pavlovian and not Skinnerian control was found using the omission procedure. In that procedure,&lt;ref&gt;see Sheffield, 1965; Williams &amp; Williams, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; food is normally scheduled for delivery following each presentation of a stimulus (often a flash of light), except in cases in which the animal actually performs a consummatory response to the stimulus, in which case food is withheld. Here, if the behavior were under instrumental control, the animal would stop attempting to consume the stimulus, as that behaviour is followed by the withholding of food. But, animals persist in attempting to consume the conditioned stimulus for thousands of trials&lt;ref&gt;Killeen, Peter R. (2003). Complex dynamic processes in sign tracking with an omission contingency (negative automaintenance). ''Journal of Experimental Psychology.'' 29(1): 49-61&lt;/ref&gt; (a phenomenon known as '''negative automaintenance'''), unable to cease their behavioural response to the conditioned stimulus even when it prevents them from obtaining a reward.

'''SHYSTER''' is a [[legal expert system]] developed at the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]] in 1993.  It was written as the doctoral dissertation of [[James Popple]] under the supervision of Robin Stanton, Roger Clarke, [[Peter Drahos]], and Malcolm Newey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|type=PhD thesis|last=Popple|first=James|author-link=James Popple|title=SHYSTER: A Pragmatic Legal Expert System|year=1993|publisher=Australian National University|isbn=0-7315-1827-6|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/theses/phd.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/SHYSTER-APragmaticLegalExpertSystem|archivedate=3 January 2007|deadurl=no|accessdate=10 August 2014}} Also {{Google books|jyQ2xnmAhXkC|available}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A full technical report of the expert system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popple|first=James|author-link=James Popple|title=SHYSTER: The Program|year=1993|publisher=Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, Australian National University|series=Technical Report TR-CS-93-13|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/reports/tr-cs-93-13.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/SHYSTER-TheProgram|archivedate=3 January 2007|deadurl=no|accessdate=10 August 2014}} Also {{Google books|8PjkWBjFy4gC|available}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a book&lt;ref name="Popple"&gt;{{cite book|last=Popple|first=James|author-link=James Popple|title=A Pragmatic Legal Expert System|year=1996|publisher=Dartmouth (Ashgate)|series=Applied Legal Philosophy Series|isbn=1-85521-739-2|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/books/shyster.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/APragmaticLegalExpertSystem|archivedate=28 December 2006|deadurl=no|accessdate=10 August 2014}} Also {{Google books|ZyfNAgAAQBAJ|available}}.&lt;/ref&gt; further detailing its development and testing have also been published.

SHYSTER emphasises its pragmatic approach, and posits that a legal expert system need not be based upon a complex model of legal reasoning in order to produce useful advice.  Although SHYSTER attempts to model the way in which lawyers argue with cases, it does not attempt to model the way in which lawyers decide which cases to use in those arguments.  SHYSTER is of a general design, permitting its operation in different legal domains.  It was designed to provide advice in areas of case law that have been specified by a legal expert using a bespoke [[specification language]].  Its knowledge of the law is acquired, and represented, as information about cases. It produces its advice by examining, and arguing about, the similarities and differences between cases.  It derives its name from [[Shyster]]: a slang word for someone who acts in a disreputable, unethical, or unscrupulous way, especially in the practice of law and politics.

==Methods==
SHYSTER is a specific example of a general category of legal expert systems, broadly defined as systems that make use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to solve legal problems.  [[Artificial intelligence and law|Legal AI]] systems can be divided into two categories: legal retrieval systems and legal analysis systems.  SHYSTER belongs to the latter category of legal analysis systems.  Legal analysis systems can be further subdivided into two categories: judgment machines and legal expert systems.  SHYSTER again belongs to the latter category of legal expert systems.  A [[legal expert system]], as Popple uses the term, is a system capable of performing at a level expected of a lawyer:  “AI systems which merely assist a lawyer in coming to legal conclusions or preparing legal arguments are not here considered to be legal expert systems; a legal expert system must exhibit some legal expertise itself."&lt;ref name="Popple"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

Designed to operate in more than one legal domain, and be of specific use to the common [[law of Australia]], SHYSTER accounts for [[statute law]], [[case law]], and the doctrine of [[precedent]] in areas of [[private law]].  Whilst it accommodates statute law, it is primarily a case-based system, in contradistinction to rule-based systems like [[MYCIN]].  More specifically, it was designed in a manner enabling it to be linked with a rule-based system to form a hybrid system.  Although case-based reasoning possesses an advantage over rule-based systems by the elimination of complex [[semantic network]]s, it suffers from intractable theoretical obstacles: without some further theory it cannot be predicted what features of a case will turn out to be relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Greinke, A. (1994): [http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v1n4/greinke14.txt ‘Legal Expert Systems: A Humanistic Critique of Mechanical Human Inference’] ''E-Law: Murdoch University Electronic Journal of Law'' Volume 1, Number 4 (December 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  Users of SHYSTER therefore require some legal expertise.

[[Richard Susskind]] argues that “jurisprudence can and ought to supply the models of law and legal reasoning that are required for computerized [sic] implementation in the process of building all expert systems in law.”&lt;ref&gt;Susskind, R. (1987): ‘Expert Systems in Law’ (Oxford) p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Popple, however, believes [[jurisprudence]] is of limited value to developers of legal expert systems.  He posits that a lawyer must have a model of the law (maybe unarticulated) which includes assumptions about the nature of law and legal reasoning, but that model need not rest on basic philosophical foundations.  It may be a pragmatic model, developed through experience within the legal system. Many lawyers perform their work with little or no jurisprudential knowledge, and there is no evidence to suggest that they are worse, or better, at their jobs than lawyers well-versed in jurisprudence.  The fact that many lawyers have mastered the process of legal reasoning, without having been immersed in jurisprudence, suggests that it may indeed be possible to develop legal expert systems of good quality without jurisprudential insight.&lt;ref name="Popple"/&gt;{{rp|6–7}}  As a pragmatic legal expert system SHYSTER is the embodiment of this belief.

A further example of SHYSTER’s pragmatism is its simple [[knowledge representation]] structure.  This structure was designed to facilitate specification of different areas of case law using a specification language.  Areas of case law are specified in terms of the cases and attributes of importance in those areas.  SHYSTER weights its attributes and checks for dependence between them.  In order to choose cases upon which to construct its opinions, SHYSTER calculates distances between cases and uses these distances to determine which of the leading cases are nearest to the instant case.  To this end SHYSTER can be seen to adopt and expand upon [[nearest neighbor search]] methods used in [[pattern recognition]].  These nearest cases are used to produce an argument (based on similarities and differences between the cases) about the likely outcome in the instant case. This argument relies on the doctrine of precedent; it assumes that the instant case will be decided the same way as was the nearest case.  SHYSTER then uses information about these nearest cases to construct a report.  The report that SHYSTER generates makes a prediction and justifies that prediction by reference only to cases and their similarities and differences: the calculations that SHYSTER performs in coming to its opinion do not appear in that opinion.  Safeguards are employed to warn users if SHYSTER doubts the veracity of its advice.

==Results==
SHYSTER was tested in four different and disparate areas of case law.  Four specifications were written, each representing an area of Australian law: an aspect of the law of [[trover]]; the meaning of “authorization [sic]” in [[Australian copyright law]]; the categorisation of employment contracts; and the implication of [[natural justice]] in administrative decision-making.  SHYSTER was evaluated under five headings: its usefulness, its generality, the quality of its advice, its limitations, and possible enhancements that could be made to it.  Despite its simple knowledge representation structure, it has shown itself capable of producing good advice, and its simple structure has facilitated the specification of different areas of law.

Appreciating the difficulties encountered by legal expert systems developers in adequately representing legal knowledge can assist in appreciating the shortcomings of [[digital rights management]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, A. (2005): ‘Rights Expression on Digital Communication Networks: Some Implications for Copyright’ ''International Journal of Law and Information Technology'' 2005 13(1) p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some academics believe future digital rights management systems may become sophisticated enough to permit exceptions to copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g.: Maillard, T. (2004): ‘Towards Digital Rights and Exemptions Management Systems’ ''Computer law and Security Report ''20 (4), pp. 281–287.&lt;/ref&gt;  To this end SHYSTER's attempt to model “authorization [sic]” in the [[Australian Copyright Act 1968|Copyright Act]] can be viewed as pioneering work in this field.  The term “authorization [sic]” is undefined in the Copyright Act.  Consequently, a number of cases have been before the courts seeking answers as to what conduct amounts to authorisation.  The main contexts in which the issue has arisen are analogous to permitted exceptions to copyright currently prevented by most digital rights management technologies: “home taping of recorded materials, photocopying in educational institutions and performing works in public”.&lt;ref&gt;McKeough, J., Bowery, K. and Griffith, P. (2002): ‘Intellectual Property: Commentary and Materials’ (third edition), Lawbook Co. p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  When applied to one case concerning [[compact cassette]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=CBS Songs v. Amstrad|court=UKHL|year=1988|num=15|date=12 May 1988|courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; SHYSTER successfully agreed that Amstrad did not authorise the infringement.&lt;ref name="Popple"/&gt;{{rp|186}}

==SHYSTER-MYCIN==
Popple highlighted the most obvious avenue of future research using SHYSTER as the development of a rule-based system, and the linking together of that rule-based system with the existing case-based system to form a hybrid system.  This intention was eventually realised by Thomas O’Callaghan, the creator of SHYSTER-MYCIN: a hybrid legal expert system first presented at ICAIL '03, 24–28 June 2003 in Edinburgh, Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=O’Callaghan|first=Thomas A.|last2=Popple|first2=James|authorlink2=James Popple|last3=McCreath|first3=Eric|title=SHYSTER-MYCIN: A Hybrid Legal Expert System|date=26 June 2003|conference=Ninth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL-03)|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]|place=Edinburgh, Scotland|pages=103-104|ISBN=1581137478|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/software/shyster/tom/icail-03.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MYCIN]] is an existing medical expert system, which was adapted for use with SHYSTER.  MYCIN’s controversial “certainty factor” is not used in SHYSTER-MYCIN.  The reason for this is the difficulty in scientifically establishing how certain a fact is in a legal domain.  The rule-based approach of the MYCIN part is used to reason with the provisions of an Act of Parliament only.&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan"&gt;{{cite book|last=O’Callaghan|first=Thomas A.|last2=McCreath|first2=Eric|last3=Popple|first3=James|authorlink3=James Popple|title=Building and Testing the SHYSTER-MYCIN Hybrid Legal Expert System|year=2003|publisher=Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, Australian National University|series=Technical Report TR-CS-03-01|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/reports/tr-cs-03-01.pdf|format=PDF|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This hybrid system enables the case-based system (SHYSTER) to determine open textured concepts when required by the rule-based system (MYCIN).&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan"/&gt;{{rp|2}} The ultimate conclusion of this joint endeavour is that a hybrid approach is preferred in the creation of legal expert systems where “it is appropriate to use rule-based reasoning when dealing with statutes, and…case-based reasoning when dealing with cases”.&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan"/&gt;{{rp|13}}

[[File:Formal languages.svg|thumb|300px|right|This diagram shows the [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic entities]] that may be constructed from [[formal language]]s. The symbols and [[string (computer science)|strings of symbols]] may be broadly divided into [[nonsense]] and well-formed formulas. A formal language can be thought of as identical to the set of its well-formed formulas. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into [[theorem]]s and non-theorems.]]
A '''logical symbol''' is a fundamental [[concept]] in [[logic]], [[type–token distinction|token]]s of which may be marks or a configuration of marks which form a particular pattern.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Although the term "symbol" in common use refers at some times to the idea being symbolized, and at other times to the marks on a piece of paper or chalkboard which are being used to express that idea; in the [[formal language]]s studied in [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], the term "symbol" refers to the idea, and the marks are considered to be a [[type-token distinction|token]] instance of the symbol.{{dubious|date=November 2012}} In logic, symbols build literal utility to illustrate ideas.

==Overview==
Symbols of a formal language need not be symbols ''of'' anything. For instance there are [[logical constant]]s which do not refer to any idea, but  rather serve as a form of punctuation in the language (e.g. parentheses). Symbols of a formal language must be capable of being specified without any reference to any [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of them.

A symbol or [[string (computer science)|string]] of symbols may comprise a [[well-formed formula]] if it is consistent with the [[formation rule]]s of the language.

In a [[formal system]] a symbol may be used as a token in formal operations.   The set of formal symbols in a [[formal language]] is referred to as an alphabet (hence each symbol may be referred to as a "letter")&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hopcroft]], [[Rajeev Motwani]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman]], [[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2010}}

A formal symbol as used in [[first-order logic]] may be a variable (member from a [[universe of discourse]]), a constant, a function (mapping to another member of universe) or a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] (mapping to T/F).

Formal symbols are usually thought of as purely [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic]] structures, composed into larger structures using a [[formal grammar]], though sometimes they may be associated with an interpretation or model (a [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]]).

==Can words be modeled as formal symbols?==

The move to view units in natural language (e.g. English)  as formal symbols was initiated by [[Noam Chomsky]] (it was this work that resulted in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] in formal languages).  The [[generative grammar]] model looked upon syntax as autonomous from semantics.  Building on these models, the logician [[Richard Montague]] proposed that semantics could also be constructed on top of the formal structure:
:There is in my opinion no important theoretical difference between natural languages and the artificial languages of logicians; indeed, I consider it possible to comprehend the syntax and semantics of both kinds of language within a single natural and mathematically precise theory. On this point I differ from a number of philosophers, but agree, I believe, with Chomsky and his associates." &lt;ref&gt;Richard Montague, ''Universal Grammar'', '''1970'''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2010}}
This is the philosophical premise underlying [[Montague grammar]].

However, this attempt to equate linguistic symbols with formal symbols has been challenged widely, particularly in the tradition of [[cognitive linguistics]], by philosophers like [[Stevan Harnad]], and linguists like [[George Lakoff]] and [[Ronald Langacker]].

A '''tacit assumption''' or '''implicit assumption''' is an assumption that includes the underlying agreements or statements made in the development of a [[logical argument]], course of action, [[Decision-making|decision]], or [[judgment]] that are not explicitly voiced nor necessarily understood by the decision maker or judge. Often, these assumptions are made based on personal life experiences, and are not consciously apparent in the [[decision making]] environment. These assumptions can be the source of apparent [[paradox]]es, misunderstandings and [[resistance to change]] in human [[organization]]al [[behavior]].

An '''underdog''' is a person or group in a competition, usually in [[sport]]s and [[creative work]]s, who is popularly expected to lose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Keinan |first1= Anat |last2= Avery |first2= Jill |last3= Paharia |first3= Neeru |title= Capitalizing on the Underdog Effect |url= http://hbr.org/2010/11/capitalizing-on-the-underdog-effect |journal= [[Harvard Business Review]] |issue= November 2010 |accessdate= 13 April 2013 }}&lt;br&gt;"Everyone loves a scrappy underdog", as the article observes.&lt;/ref&gt; The party, team, or individual expected to win is called the favorite or [[wikt:top dog|top dog]]. In the case where an underdog wins, the outcome is an [[Upset (competition)|upset]]. An "underdog bet" is a [[Sports betting|bet]] on the underdog or outsider for which the [[odds]] are generally higher.

The first recorded uses of the term occurred in the second half of the 18th century;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/underdog|title=Definition of UNDERDOG|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Shorter Oxford Dictionary, Third Edition, 1983. First use 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; its first meaning was "the beaten dog in a fight".&lt;ref&gt;The Shorter Oxford Dictionary, Third Edition, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Culture of Britain|British]] and [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], underdogs are highly regarded. This harkens to core [[Judeo-Christian]] [[Parable|parables]] such as the story of [[Goliath|David and Goliath]] and also ancient British legends such as Robin Hood and King Arthur, and reflects the ideal behind the [[American Dream|American dream]], where someone who is poor and/or weak can use hard work to achieve victory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Asian American Sporting Cultures|last=Halberstam|first=J.

In a story, the [[Fool (stock character)|Fool]] is often an underdog if they are the main character. Their apparent ineptitude leads to people underestimating their true abilities, and they are able to win either through luck or hidden wisdom against a more powerful, "establishment" villain. An example in film is [[The Tramp]] portrayed by [[Charlie Chaplin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Save the Cat!: The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need|last=Snyder|first=Blake|publisher=Michael Wiese Productions|year=2005|isbn=1615930000|location=|pages=37|chapter=Give Me The Same Thing...

[[File:Universal Orbital Support System.png|thumb|220x220px|Example of a possible layout using the Universal Orbital Support System.]]

==Explanation==

===Background===
A concept for providing space-based support to things suspended above an [[astronomical object]]. It is envisioned as a type of non-rotating [[tethered satellite system]]. The orbital system is a coupled mass system wherein the upper supporting mass (A) is placed in an orbit around a given celestial body such that it can support a suspended mass (B) at a specific height above the surface of the celestial body, but lower than (A). The relationship between (A) and (B) is such that it (A) moves higher as (B) is lowered towards the surface, the distance is related as an inverse proportion of their masses.

=== Practical examples ===
This system has been proposed for the [[Analemma]] Tower &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2017/0329/A-20-mile-long-spacescraper-dangling-from-an-asteroid-Could-it-work|title=A 20-mile long 'spacescraper' dangling from an asteroid: Could it work?|last=Wood|first=Charlie|date=March 29, 2017|website=www.csmonitor.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; concept, which employs the system to suspend a building from a cable supported by an [[asteroid]] orbiting earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Clouds AO|title=Analemma Tower - Clouds AO|date=2017-04-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVwvdcJ8yHo&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Special characters}}

A '''veil''' is an article of clothing or hanging cloth that is intended to cover some part of the [[human head|head]] or [[face]], or an object of some significance. Veiling has a long history in European, Asian, and African societies. The practice has been prominent in different forms in [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The practice of veiling is especially associated with women and sacred objects, though in some cultures it is men rather than women who are expected to wear a veil. Besides its enduring religious significance, veiling continues to play a role in some modern secular contexts, such as wedding customs.

==History==

[[File:Bronze_Statuette_of_a_Veiled_and_Masked_Dancer_1.jpg|thumb|upright|Greek bronze statuette of a veiled and masked dancer, 2nd–3rd century BC.]]

=== Antiquity ===

Elite women in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and in the [[Rise of Macedon|Greek]] and [[Persian Empire|Persian empires]] wore the veil as a sign of respectability and high status.&lt;ref name="Ahmed 1992 15"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|year=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest attested reference to veiling is found a [[Middle Assyrian Empire|Middle Assyrian]] law code dating from between 1400 and 1100 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Graeber |first= David |authorlink= David Graeber |year= 2011 |title= Debt: The First 5000 Years |place= Brooklyn, NY |publisher= Melville House |isbn= 9781933633862 |lccn= 2012462122 |oclc=  |page= 184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assyria had explicit [[sumptuary laws]] detailing which women must veil and which women must not, depending upon the woman's class, rank, and occupation in society.&lt;ref name="Ahmed 1992 15"/&gt; Female slaves and prostitutes were forbidden to veil and faced harsh penalties if they did so.&lt;ref name="El Guindi"&gt;{{Cite book|last=El Guindi|first=Fadwa|title=Hijab|publisher=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|author2=Sherifa Zahur|year= 2009|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195305135.001.0001|isbn=9780195305135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Middle Assyrian law code states:&lt;blockquote&gt;§ 40.

Whoever sees a veiled prostitute shall seize her, secure witnesses, and bring her to the palace entrance. They shall not take her jewelry; he who has seized her shall take her clothing; they shall strike her 50 blows with rods; they shall pour hot pitch over her head. And if a man should see a veiled prostitute and release her and not bring her to the palace entrance: they shall strike that man 50 blows with rods; the one who informs against him shall take his clothing; they shall pierce his ears, thread (them) on a cord, tie (it) at his back; he shall perform the king’s service for one full month. Slave-women shall not veil themselves, and he who should see a veiled slave-woman shall seize her and bring her to the palace entrance: they shall cut off her ears; he who seizes her shall take her clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in the Ancient Near East|last=Stol|first=Marten|publisher=De Gruyter|others=Richardson, Helen,, Richardson, M.

Classical Greek and [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] statues sometimes depict Greek women with both their head and face covered by a veil. Caroline Galt and Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones have both argued from such representations and literary references that it was commonplace for women (at least those of higher status) in ancient Greece to cover their hair and face in public. [[Roman Empire|Roman]] women were expected to wear veils as a symbol of the husband's authority over his wife; a married woman who omitted the veil was seen as withdrawing herself from marriage. In 166 BC, consul [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus|Sulpicius Gallus]] divorced his wife because she had left the house unveiled, thus allowing all to see, as he said, what only he should see. Unmarried girls normally didn't veil their heads, but matrons did so to show their modesty and chastity, their ''pudicitia''. Veils also protected women against the evil eye, it was thought.&lt;ref&gt;Sebesta, Judith Lynn. "Symbolism in the Costume of the Roman Woman", pp. 46-53  in Judith Lynn Sebesta &amp; Larissa Bonfante, ''The World of Roman Costume'', University of Wisconsin Press 2001, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

A veil called ''flammeum'' was the most prominent feature of the costume worn by the bride at [[Marriage in ancient Rome|Roman weddings]]. The veil was a deep yellow color reminiscent of a candle flame. The ''flammeum'' also evoked the veil of the [[Flamen Dialis|Flaminica Dialis]], the Roman priestess who could not divorce her husband, the [[Flamen Dialis|high priest of Jupiter]], and thus was seen as a good omen for lifelong fidelity to one man. The Romans apparently thought of the bride as being "clouded over with a veil" and connected the verb ''nubere'' (to be married) with ''nubes'', the word for cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxGPLju4KEkC&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=flammeum&amp;pg=PA55|pages=55–56|title=The World of Roman Costume|editors=Judith Lynn Sebesta, Larissa Bonfante|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|year=2001|chapter=The Costume of the Roman Bridge|author=Laetitia La Follette|isbn=9780299138547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intermixing of populations resulted in a convergence of the cultural practices of Greek, Persian, and Mesopotamian empires and the [[Semitic people|Semitic peoples]] of the Middle East.&lt;ref name="El Guindi"/&gt; Veiling and seclusion of women appear to have established themselves among Jews and Christians, before spreading to urban Arabs of the upper classes and eventually among the urban masses.&lt;ref name="El Guindi"/&gt; In the rural areas it was common to cover the hair, but not the face.&lt;ref name="El Guindi"/&gt;

=== Later history ===

[[File:Veils bavaria ncd 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], queen of France, wearing veiling]]

For many centuries, until around 1175, [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] and then [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] women, with the exception of young unmarried girls, wore veils that entirely covered their hair, and often their necks up to their chins (see [[wimple]]). Only in the [[Tudor period]] (1485), when [[hood (headgear)|hood]]s became increasingly popular, did veils of this type become less common. This depended greatly from one country to the other. In Italy, veils, including face veils, were worn in some regions until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''Doni, Elena &amp; Manuela Fulgenz, Il secolo delle donne. L’Italia del novecento al femminile'', (The Women’s Century. Italian Women in the 20th Century), Laterza 2001, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in southern Italy often covered their heads to show that they were modest, well-behaved and pious. They generally wore a ''cuffia'' (cap), then the ''fazzoletto'' (kerchief/head scarves) a long triangular or rectangular piece of cloth that could be tied in various way, and sometimes covered the whole face except the eyes, sometimes ''bende (lit. swaddles, bandages)'' or a wimple underneath too.&lt;ref&gt;See: Storia del costume sardo (A History of Sardinian Clothing – female headcoverings.) &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ladonnasarda.it/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1066%3Astoria-del-costume-sardo-su-muccadore-il-copricapo&amp;Itemid=691#.VU-VcY5_Oko{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

For centuries, European women have worn sheer veils, but only under certain circumstances.  Sometimes a veil of this type was draped over and pinned to the [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]] or hat of a woman in [[mourning]], especially at the [[funeral]] and during the subsequent period of "high mourning".  They would also have been used, as an alternative to a [[mask]], as a simple method of hiding the identity of a woman who was traveling to meet a lover, or doing anything she didn't want other people to find out about.  More pragmatically, veils were also sometimes worn to protect the complexion from sun and wind damage (when un-tanned skin was fashionable), or to keep dust out of a woman's face, much as the [[keffiyeh]] is used today.

[[File:A_Coptic_woman_of_the_Poorer_Class._(1918)_-_TIMEA.jpg|thumb|[[Copts|Coptic]] Christian woman wearing a veil (1918)]]

In [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] the concept of covering the head is or was associated with propriety and modesty. Most traditional depictions of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], the mother of [[Christ]], show her veiled. During the [[Middle Ages]] most European married women covered their hair rather than their face, with a variety of styles of [[wimple]], kerchiefs and headscarfs. Veiling, covering the hair, rather than the face, was a common practice with church-going women until the 1960s, Catholic women typically using [[lace]], and a number of very traditional churches retain the custom. Bonnets were the rule in non-Catholic churches. Lace face-veils are still often worn by female relatives at funerals in some Catholic countries. In [[Orthodox Judaism]], married women cover their hair for reasons of modesty; many Orthodox Jewish women wear headscarves ([[tichel]]) for that purpose.

Christian Byzantine literature expressed rigid norms pertaining to veiling of women, which have been influenced by Persian traditions, although there is evidence to suggest that they differed significantly from actual practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|year=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Islam identified with the monotheistic religions practiced in the Byzantine and [[Sassanian]] empires, in the aftermath of the [[early Muslim conquests]] veiling of women was adopted as an appropriate expression of Qur'anic ideals regarding modesty and piety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Leila|title=Women and Gender in Islam|year=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veiling gradually spread to upper-class Arab women, and eventually, it became widespread among Muslim women in cities throughout the Middle East. Veiling of Arab Muslim women became especially pervasive under Ottoman rule as a mark of rank and exclusive lifestyle, and Istanbul of the 17th century witnessed differentiated dress styles that reflected geographical and occupational identities.&lt;ref name="El Guindi"/&gt; Women in rural areas were much slower to adopt veiling because the garments interfered with their work in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Esposito|first=John|title=Islam: The Straight Path|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=99|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since wearing a veil was impractical for working women, "a veiled woman silently announced that her husband was rich enough to keep her idle."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Jonathan; Blair, Sheila (2002). Islam: A Thousand Years of Faith and Power. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-09422-1}}., p.47&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century, upper-class urban Muslim and Christian women in Egypt wore a garment which included a head cover and a ''burqa'' ([[muslin]] cloth that covered the lower nose and the mouth).&lt;ref name="El Guindi"&gt;{{Cite book|last=El Guindi|first=Fadwa|title=Hijab|publisher=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|author2=Sherifa Zahur|year= 2009|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195305135.001.0001|isbn=9780195305135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to the first half of the twentieth century, rural women in the Maghreb and Egypt put on a face veil when they visited urban areas, "as a sign of civilization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=be7sCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA276|page=276|title=Religion in Public Spaces: A European Perspective|editors=Silvio Ferrari, Sabrina Pastorelli|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|author=Sara Silverstri|chapter=Comparing Burqa Debates in Europe|isbn=9781317067542}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of veiling gradually declined in much of the Muslim world during the 20th century before making a comeback in recent decades.

Although religion is a common reason for choosing to veil, the practice also reflects political and personal conviction, so that it can serve as a medium through which personal character can be revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Secor, A.

Among the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Songhai people|Songhai]], [[Hausa people|Hausa]], and [[Fulani]] of [[West Africa]], women do not traditionally wear the veil, while men do.

In some parts of [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Nepal]], men wear a ''[[sehra (headdress)|sehra]]'' on their wedding day. This is a male veil covering the whole face and neck. The sehra is made from either flowers, beads, tinsel, dry leaves, or coconuts. The most common sehra is made from fresh marigolds. The groom wears this throughout the day concealing his face even during the wedding ceremony. In Northern India today you can see the groom arriving on a horse with the sehra wrapped around his head.

Biblical references include:

* Hebrew ''mitpachat'' ([[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] 3:15; marg., "sheet" or "apron;" R.V., "mantle"). In [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 3:22 this word is plural, rendered "wimples;" R.V., "shawls" i.e. wraps.book of Isaiah 3:23 The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the veils.
* ''Massekah'' (Isaiah 25:7; in Isa. 28:20 rendered "covering").  The word denotes something spread out and covering or concealing something else (comp. 2 Cor. 3:13–15).
* ''Masveh'' ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 34:33, 35), the veil on the face of [[Moses]].  This verse should be read, "And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face," as in the [[Revised Version]]. When Moses spoke to them he was without the veil; only when he ceased speaking he put on the veil (comp. 2 Cor. 3:13, etc.).
* ''Parochet'' (Ex. 26:31–35), the veil of the [[tabernacle]] and the [[temple]], which hung between the holy place and the most holy (2 Chr. 3:14). In the temple a partition wall separated these two places. In it were two folding doors, which are supposed to have been always open, the entrance being concealed by the veil which the [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]] lifted when he entered into the sanctuary on the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]]. This veil was rent when [[crucifixion|Christ died on the cross]] (Matt. 27:51; [[Gospel of Mark]] 15:38; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 23:45).
* ''Tza'iph'' ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 24:65). [[Rebecca|Rebekah]] "took a veil and covered herself." (See also 38:14, 19.) [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] women generally appeared in public with the face visible (12:14; 24:16; 29:10; 1 Sam. 1:12).
* ''Radhidh'' ([[Song of Songs|Cant.]] 5:7, R.V. "mantle;" Isaiah 3:23). The word probably denotes some kind of cloak or wrapper.
* ''Masak'', the veil which hung before the entrance to the holy place (Ex. 26:36, 37).
Note: {{bibleverse||Genesis|20:16}}, which the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version]] renders as: "And unto [[Sarah]] [[Abimelech|he]] said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a [[covering of the eyes]], unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved" has been interpreted in one source as implied advice to Sarah to conform to a supposed custom of married women, and wear a complete veil, covering the eyes as well as the rest of the face,&lt;ref name="Eastons Covering"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/easton/ebd2.html?term=Covering%20of%20the%20eyes#c-p445 |title=Covering of the eyes |work=[[Easton's Bible Dictionary|The Illustrated Bible Dictionary, Third Edition]], by [[Matthew George Easton]] M.A., D.D, 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the phrase is generally taken to refer not to Sarah's eyes, but to the eyes of others, and to be merely a metaphorical expression concerning vindication of Sarah ([[New American Standard Bible|NASB]], [[Russian Synodal Bible|RSV]]), silencing criticism ([[God's Word (Bible translation)|GWT]]), allaying suspicions ([[New Jerusalem Bible|NJB]]), righting a wrong ([[Bible in Basic English|BBE]], [[New Living Translation|NLT]]), covering or recompensing the problem caused her ([[New International Version|NIV]], New Life Version, [[NIRV]], [[Today's New International Version|TNIV]], [[Jerusalem Bible|JB]]), a sign of her innocence ([[English Standard Version|ESV]], [[Contemporary English Version|CEV]], [[Holman Christian Standard Bible|HCSB]]). The final phrase in the verse, which KJV takes to mean "she was reproved", is taken by almost all other versions to mean instead "she was vindicated", and the word "הוא", which KJV interprets as "he" (Abraham), is interpreted as "it" (the money). Thus, the general view is that this passage has nothing to do with material veils.

==== Veiling of objects ====

Among [[Christian Church|Christian churches]] which have a [[liturgy|liturgical]] tradition, several different types of veils are used. These veils are often symbolically tied to the veils in the [[Tabernacle]] in the wilderness and in [[Solomon's Temple]]. The purpose of these veils was not so much to obscure as to shield the most sacred things from the eyes of sinful men. In [[Solomon's Temple]] the veil was placed between the "Inner Sanctuary" and the "[[Holy of Holies]]". According to the New Testament, this veil was torn when [[Jesus Christ]] died on the cross. 

*Tabernacle veil
: Used to cover the [[church tabernacle]], particularly in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition but in some others as well, when the [[Eucharist]] is actually stored in it. The veil is used to remind worshipers that the (usually metal) tabernacle cabinet echoes the tabernacle tent of the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Scriptures]], and it signals that the tabernacle is actually in use. It may be of any liturgical color, but is most often white (always appropriate for the Eucharist), [[cloth of gold]] or silver (which may substitute for any liturgical color aside from violet), or the liturgical color of the day (red, green or violet). It may be simple, unadorned linen or silk, or it may be fringed or otherwise decorated.  It is often designed to match the [[vestment]]s of the [[Priest|celebrant]]s.

*Ciborium veil
: The [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]] is a goblet-like metal vessel with a cover, used in the Roman Catholic Church and some others to hold the consecrated [[Sacramental bread|hosts]] of the Eucharist when, for instance, it is stored in the tabernacle or when [[Eucharist|communion]] is to be distributed. It may be veiled with a white cloth, usually silk. This veiling was formerly required but is now optional. In part, it signals that the ciborium actually contains the [[Consecration|consecrated]] Eucharist at the moment.

*Chalice veil
: During Eucharist celebrations, a veil is often used to cover the [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] and [[paten]] to keep dust and flying insects away from the bread and wine. Often made of rich material, the chalice veils have not only a practical purpose, but are also intended to show honor to vessels used for the [[sacrament]].
:In the West, a single chalice veil is normally used. The veil will usually be the same material and color as the priest's vestments, though it may also be white. It covers the chalice and paten when not actually in use on the altar.
:In the East, three veils are used: one for the chalice, one for the [[Paten|diskos]] (paten), and a third one (the [[Aër]]) is used to cover both. The veils for the chalice and diskos are usually square with four [[lappet]]s hanging down the sides, so that when the veil is laid out flat it will be shaped like a cross. The Aër is rectangular and usually larger than the chalice veil used in the West. The Aër also figures prominently in other liturgical respects.

*Humeral veil
: The [[humeral veil]] is used in both Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches during the liturgy of Exposition and [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]], and on some other occasions when special respect is shown to the Eucharist. From the [[Latin]] for "shoulders," it is an oblong piece of cloth worn as a sort of [[shawl]], used to symbolize a more profound awareness of the respect due to the Eucharist by shielding the celebrant's hands from actually contacting the vessel holding the Eucharist, either a [[monstrance]] or [[Ciborium (container)|ciborium]], or in some cases to shield the vessel itself from the eyes of participants. It is worn only by [[bishop]]s, [[priest]]s or [[deacon]]s.

*Vimpa
:A [[vimpa]] is a veil or shawl worn over the shoulders of servers who carry the [[mitre|miter]] and [[crosier]] in Roman Catholic liturgical functions when they are not being used by the bishop.

*Chancel veil
:In the early liturgies, there was often a veil that separated the sanctuary from the rest of the church (again, based upon the biblical description of the Tabernacle). In the Byzantine liturgy this veil developed into the [[iconostasis]], but a veil or curtain is still used behind the [[Royal Doors]] (the main doors leading into the sanctuary), and is opened and closed at specific times during the liturgy. In the West, it developed into the Rood Veil, and later the [[Rood screen|Rood Screen]], and finally the [[chancel]] rail, the low sanctuary railing in those churches that still have this. In some of the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Churches]] (for instance, the [[East Syrian Rite|Syrian liturgy]]) the use of a veil across the entire sanctuary has been retained.

*Lenten veiling
: Some churches veil their crosses during [[Passiontide]] with a fine semi-transparent mesh. The color of the veil may be black, red, purple, or white, depending upon the liturgical day and practice of the church. In traditional churches, there will sometimes be curtains placed to either side of the altar.

The '''[[The Protection of the Mother of God|Veil of our Lady]]''' is a liturgical feast celebrating the protection afforded by the [[intercession]]s of the Virgin Mary.

==== Veiling by women ====

Traditionally, in Christianity, women were enjoined to cover their heads in church, just as it was (and still is) customary for men to remove their hat as a sign of respect. This practice is based on {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:4–16}}, where [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered brings shame upon his head. But any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled brings shame upon her head, for it is one and the same thing as if she had had her head shaved. For if a woman does not have her head veiled, she may as well have her hair cut off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should wear a veil. A man, on the other hand, should not cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; nor was man created for woman, but woman for man; for this reason a woman should have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels. Woman is not independent of man or man of woman in the Lord. For just as woman came from man, so man is born of woman; but all things are from God. Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head unveiled? Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears his hair long it is a disgrace to him, whereas if a woman has long hair it is her glory, because long hair has been given (her) for a covering? But if anyone is inclined to be argumentative, we do not have such a custom, nor do the churches of God ([[New American Bible]] translation)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In many traditional [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, and in some very conservative [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches as well, the custom continues of women covering their heads in church (or even when praying privately at home).

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], it was customary in most places before the 1960s for women to wear a headcovering in the form of a scarf, cap, veil or hat when entering a church. The practice now continues in isolated parishes where it is seen as a matter of etiquette, courtesy, tradition or fashionable elegance.  The Declaration Inter-Insigniores by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has made it clear that the practice of headcovering for women was a matter of ecclesiastical discipline and not of Divine law.

The wearing of a headcovering was for the first time mandated as a universal rule for the [[Latin Rite]] by the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law of 1917]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jgray.org/codes/cic17lat.html |title=1917 Codex Iuris Canonici |work= Canon 1262, Section 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which code was abrogated by the advent of the present (1983) Code of Canon Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P2.HTM |title=Canon 6 §1 of the Code of Canon Law }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionalist Catholics still follow it, generally as a matter of custom and biblically approved aptness; some also suppose that St. Paul's directive is in full force today as an ordinance of its own right, despite the teaching of the Congregation for Doctrine of the Faith's pronouncement on the matter.  

A veil over the hair rather than the face forms part of the headdress of some [[Catholic religious order|order]]s of [[nun]]s or [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] sisters; this is why a woman who becomes a nun is said "to take the veil". In medieval times married women normally covered their hair outside the house, and a nun's veil is based on secular medieval styles, often reflecting the fashion of widows in their attire.  In many institutes, a white veil is used as the "veil of probation" during [[novitiate]], and a dark veil for the "veil of profession" once religious vows are taken; the color scheme varies with the color scheme of the habit of the order. A veil of [[consecration]], longer and fuller, is used by some orders for final profession of [[solemn vow]]s.

Nuns are the female counterparts of [[monk]]s, and many [[monasticism|monastic orders]] of women have retained the veil. Regarding other institutes of religious sisters who are not [[cloister]]ed but who work as teachers, nurses or in other "active" apostolates outside of a nunnery or monastery, some wear the veil, while some others have abolished the use of the veil, and a few never had a veil to start with, but used a bonnet-style headdress as in the case of [[St. Elizabeth Ann Seton]].

The fullest versions of the nun's veil cover the top of the head and flow down around and over the shoulders.  In western Christianity, it does not wrap around the neck or face. In those orders that retain one, the starched white covering about the face neck and shoulders is known as a [[wimple]] and is a separate garment.

The Catholic Church has revived the ancient practice of allowing women to be consecrated by their bishop as a [[consecrated virgin]]. These women are set aside as sacred persons who belong only to Christ and the service of the church. The veil is a bridal one, because the velatio virginum primarily signified the newly consecrated virgin as the Bride of Christ.  At one point this veil was called the flammeum because it was supposed to remind the virgin of the indissoluble nuptial bond she was contracting with Christ.  The wearing of the flammeum for the sacred virgin Bride of Christ arose from the bridal attire of the strictest pagan marriage which did not permit of divorce at the time. The flammeum was a visible reminder that divorce was not possible with Christ, their Divine Spouse. Consecrated virgins are under the direct care of the local [[bishop (Catholic church)|bishop]], without belonging to a particular order, and they receive the veil as a bridal sign of [[consecration]].  

There has also been renewed interest in the last half century in the ancient practice of women and men dedicating themselves as [[anchorite]]s or [[hermit]]s, and there is a formal process whereby such persons can seek recognition of their vows by the local bishop; a veil for these women would be traditional.

Some [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] women's religious orders also wear a veil, differing according to the traditions of each order.

In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Rites]] of the Catholic Church, a veil called an ''[[epanokamelavkion]]'' is used by both nuns and monks, in both cases covering completely the ''[[kamilavka|kamilavkion]]'', a cylindrical hat they both wear. In [[Church Slavonic language|Slavic]] practice, when the veil is worn over the hat, the entire [[headgear|headdress]] is referred to as a ''[[klobuk]]''. Nuns wear an additional veil under the ''klobuk'', called an ''[[apostolnik]]'', which is drawn together to cover the neck and shoulders as well as the head, leaving the face itself open.

{{Main|Hijab}}
[[File:N°3 HAÏK alt version.jpg|thumbnail|Women in the predominantly Islamic country of Algeria wearing a [[haïk]], a type of veil.]]

A variety of headdresses worn by [[Women in Islam|Muslim women]] and girls in accordance with ''[[hijab]]'' (the principle of dressing modestly) are sometimes referred to as veils.  The principal aim of the Muslim veil is to cover the [[Intimate parts in Islam|''Awrah'']] (parts of the body that are considered private). Many of these garments cover the hair, ears and throat, but do not cover the face. 

Depending on geography and culture, the veil is referenced and worn in different ways. The ''[[Hijab|khimar]]'' is a type of [[headscarf]].  The ''[[niqāb]]'' and ''[[burqa]]'' are two kinds of veils that cover most of the face except for a slit or hole for the eyes. In [[Algeria]], a larger veil called the ''[[haïk]]'' includes a triangular panel to cover the lower part of the face.&lt;ref&gt;Kellou, Dorothée Myriam. [http://observers.france24.com/en/20150316-algeria-women-haik-veil-march Algerian women take to streets to bring back traditional veil]. ''The Observers''. 16 March 2015. Accessed on 5 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Arabian Peninsula and parts of North Africa (specifically Saudi Arabia), the abaya is worn constructed like a loose robe covering everything but the face itself. In another location, such as Iran, the chador is worn as the semicircles of fabric are draped over the head like a shawl and held in place under the neck by hand. The two terms for veiling that are directly mentioned in the Quran is the jilbab and the khimar. In these references, the veiling is meant to promote modesty by covering the genitals and breasts of women. 

The [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] burqa covers the entire body, obscuring the face completely, except for a grille or netting over the eyes to allow the wearer to see. The ''[[boshiya]]'' is a veil that may be worn over a headscarf; it covers the entire face and is made of a sheer fabric so the wearer is able to see through it. It has been suggested that [[Byzantine dress|the practice of wearing a veil]]&amp;nbsp;– uncommon among the [[Arab]] tribes prior to the rise of [[Islam]]&amp;nbsp;– originated in the [[Byzantine Empire]], and then spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://medievalnews.blogspot.com/2007/09/review-of-byzantium-surprising-life-of.html |title=Review of Herrin book and Michael Angold |work=Church and Society in Byzantium Under the Comneni, 1081–1261 |pages= 426–7 &amp; ff;1995 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-521-26986-5 |date=2000-09-21 }} see also {{cite book |author=[[John Esposito]] |title=Islam: The Straight Path |pages=98, 3rd Edition |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year= 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indian religions ===



{{Further|Ghoonghat|Purdah}}

In [[Indian subcontinent]], from 1st century B.C. societies advocated the use of the veil for married [[Hindu]] women which came to be known as [[Ghoonghat]].&lt;ref&gt;Anant Sadashiv Altekar(1959) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.174&lt;/ref&gt;  Buddhists attempted to counter this growing practice around 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Betty Kelen 1967 "Gautama Buddha: In Life and Legend" chapter 1, p. 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt; Rational opposition against veiling and seclusion from spirited ladies resulted in system not becoming popular for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Anant Sadashiv Altekar(1959) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.171&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Medieval [[Islamic]] [[Mughal Empire]], various aspects of veiling and seclusion of women was adopted, such as the concept of [[Purdah]] and [[Zenana]], partly as an additional protection for women.&lt;ref&gt;Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.175&lt;/ref&gt; [[Purdah]] became common in the 15th and 16th century, as both ''Vidyāpati'' and ''Chaitanya'' mention it.&lt;ref&gt;Anant Sadashiv Altekar (1959) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.175&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhism was highly critical of all forms of strict veiling, Guru Amar Das condemned it and rejected seclusion and veiling of women, which saw decline of veiling among some classes during late medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;Sardar Harjeet Singh(2009) "The Position of Women in Hindu Civilization.", p.259&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bridal veils ==

In the 19th century, wedding veils came to symbolize the woman's [[virginity]] and [[modesty]].  The tradition of a veiled bride's face continues even today wherein, a virgin bride, especially in Christian or Jewish culture, enters the marriage ritual with a veiled face and head, and remains fully veiled, both head and face, until the ceremony concludes.  After the full conclusion of the wedding ceremony, either the bride's father lifts the veil giving the bride to the groom who then kisses her, or the new groom lifts her face veil in order to kiss her, which symbolizes the groom's right to enter into conjugal relations with his bride.&lt;ref name=Ingrassia&gt;{{cite book |author= Ingrassia, Catherine |editor= Curran, Colleen |title= Altared: bridezillas, bewilderment, big love, breakups, and what women really think about contemporary weddings |publisher= Vintage Books |location= New York |year= 2007 |chapter= Diana, Martha and Me |pages= 24–30 |isbn= 978-0-307-27763-3 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judaism ===



In Judaism, the tradition of wearing a veil dates back to biblical times. According to the Torah in {{bibleverse||Genesis|24:65|HE}}, Isaac is brought Rebekah to marry by his father Abraham's servant.  It is important to note that Rebekah did not veil herself when traveling with her lady attendants and Abraham's servant and his men to meet Isaac, but she only did so when Isaac was approaching.  Just before the wedding ceremony the [[badeken]] or bedeken is held.  The groom places the veil over the bride's face, and either he or the officiating Rabbi gives her a blessing. The veil stays on her face until just before the end of the wedding ceremony&amp;nbsp;– when they are legally married according to Jewish law&amp;nbsp;– then the groom helps lift the veil from off her face.

The most often cited interpretation for the [[badeken]] is that, according to {{bibleverse||Genesis|29|HE}}, when Jacob went to marry Rachel, his father in law Laban tricked him into marrying Leah, Rachel's older and homlier sister. Many say that the veiling ceremony takes place to make sure that the groom is marrying the right bride.  Some say that as the groom places the veil over his bride, he makes an implicit promise to clothe and protect her.  Finally, by covering her face, the groom recognizes that he his marrying the bride for her inner beauty; while looks will fade with time, his love will be everlasting. In some ultra-orthodox traditions the bride wears an opaque veil as she is escorted down the aisle to meet her groom.  This shows her complete willingness to enter into the marriage and her absolute trust that she is marrying the right man.  In Judaism, a wedding is not considered valid unless the bride willingly consents to it.

In ancient [[Judaism]] the lifting of the veil took place just prior to the consummation of the marriage in sexual union.  The uncovering or unveiling that takes place in the [[wedding ceremony]] is a symbol of what will take place in the marriage bed.  Just as the two become one through their words spoken in wedding vows, so these words are a sign of the physical oneness that they will consummate later on.  The lifting of the veil is a symbol and an anticipation of this.

=== Christianity ===

[[File:Memchu wedding.jpg|thumb|300px|A Christian minister marries a groom and bride, the latter who is wearing a wedding veil in the church]]

In Christian theology, [[Saint Paul|St. Paul's]] words concerning how marriage symbolizes the union of Christ and His Church may underlie part of the tradition of veiling in the marriage ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;(cf. ''Letter to the Ephesians'', chapter 5)&lt;/ref&gt;  In this respect, veiling may signify the waters of [[baptism]], with the wedding dress (and veil) being but a larger version of the [[First Communion]] dress (and veil), which in turn is but a larger version of a baby's baptismal garment,&lt;ref&gt;[[Baptismal garment#Roman Catholic tradition]]&lt;/ref&gt; which is the distinguishing garment of all Christians, signifying the presence of Sanctifying Grace and the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. 7:13&amp;ndash;14, 22:14, Matt. 22:11&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt;

At an even deeper level, the waters of baptism themselves symbolize the waters of death,&lt;ref&gt;Rom. 6:3-4ff&lt;/ref&gt; which must be accepted in faith, and passed through, before truly complete joy can be experienced in [[Heaven]].  In this respect, the religious veil is a reminder to the bride that she is dying to her previous life, and being admitted to a new kind of life, symbolic of eternal life in Heaven.  For this reason, nuns are veiled—often with a black veil—with the veil not merely signifying the veil of death, but actually—in some real way—being that veil, since they will one day be buried in it. 

The wedding veil is also a symbol of the veil of faith&lt;ref&gt;II Cor. 5:7&lt;/ref&gt; in Jesus Christ, the Heavenly bridegroom, that He will one day come and redeem our mortal bodies, by the lifting of that veil, so that we shall see Him face to face in Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Rom. 8:11, I Cor. 13:12&lt;/ref&gt;  Sacred virgins receive not the religious veil&amp;mdash;unless they are also nuns&amp;mdash;but a bridal veil because they are espoused to Christ in the solemn rite of Consecration of Virgins.  The consecrated virgins' veil has always symbolized being a bride of Christ and the indissoluble nuptial bond the sacred virgin enjoys with Christ.  Lastly, the wedding dress, either with, or even without a veil, may be a symbol of the radiance of the resurrected body in Heaven, which will not be a mortal body, but which will have been changed "in the twinkling of an eye" into something new that we cannot now even imagine.&lt;ref&gt;I Cor. 15:44, 52&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern customs ===

[[File:Bride with bouquet.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A bride wearing a typical wedding veil]]

An occasion on which a Western woman is likely to wear a veil is on her [[white wedding]] day. [[Bride]]s once used to wear their hair flowing down their back at their wedding to symbolize their virginity. Veils covering the hair and face became a symbolic reference to the virginity of the bride thereafter. A bride may wear the face veil through the ceremony. Then either her father lifts the veil, presenting the bride to her groom, or the groom lifts the veil to symbolically consummate the marriage. {{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Brides may make use of the veil to symbolize and emphasize their status of purity during their wedding however, and if they do, the lifting of the veil may be ceremonially recognized as the crowning event of the wedding, when the beauty of the bride is finally revealed to the groom and the guests.

In modern weddings, the ceremony of removing a face veil after the wedding to present the groom with the bride may not occur, since couples may have entered into conjugal relations prior to the wedding and it may also be considered sexist for the bride to have her face covered whether or not the veil is a sign of virginity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remedies for Sexism in Christian Weddings by Tory Paez|url=http://www.lipstickandpolitics.com/play-2/the-meaning-of-wedding-traditions-and-what-to-watch-for-friday|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022215031/http://www.lipstickandpolitics.com/play-2/the-meaning-of-wedding-traditions-and-what-to-watch-for-friday|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 October 2014|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scandinavia, brides wear a veil usually under a traditional crown but do not have their face covered (instead the veil is attached to and hangs from the back).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridal Crown History from Sweden|url=https://www.ingebretsens.com/culture/weddings/bridal-crowns|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mourning veils ==

Veils remained a part of Western mourning dress customs into the modern times. The tradition of widow's veiling has its roots in nun's attire, which symbolized modesty and chastity. The mourning veil was commonly seen as a means of shielding the mourner and hiding her grief, and, on the contrary, seen by some women as a means of publicly expressing their emotions. Mourning veils have also been sometimes perceived as expressions of elegance or even sex appeal. In a 19th-century American etiquette book one finds: "Black is becoming, and young widows, fair, plump, and smiling, with their roguish eyes sparkling under their black veils are very seducing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BBC - Culture|title=Mourning Glory|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20141103-mourning-glory-funeral-style|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==

One view is that as a religious item, it is intended to honor a person, object or space. The actual sociocultural, psychological, and sociosexual functions of veils have not been studied extensively but most likely include the maintenance of social distance and the communication of social status and cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, R.F. (1964). Social Distance and the Veil. American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 66, No. 6, Part 1, pp. 1257–1274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brenner, S. (1996). Reconstructing Self and Society: Javanese Muslim Women and "The Veil". American Ethnologist, Vol. 23, No. 4, pp. 673–697&lt;/ref&gt;

A veil also has symbolic interpretations, as something partially concealing, disguising, or obscuring.

==Etymology==
The English word [[wikt:veil|''veil'']] ultimately originates from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:velum#Latin|vēlum]]'', which also means "[[sail]]," from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*wegʰslom'', from the verbal root ''*wegʰ-'' "to drive, to move or ride in a vehicle" (compare ''way'' and ''[[wikt:wain|wain]]'') and the tool/instrument suffix ''*-slo-'', because the sail makes the ship move. Compare the [[diminutive]] form ''[[wikt:vexillum|vexillum]]'', and the Slavic cognate ''[[wikt:veslo|veslo]]'' "oar, paddle", attested in Czech and Serbo-Croatian.

'''Vitalism''' is the belief that "living organisms are fundamentally different from non-living entities because they contain some non-physical element or are governed by different principles than are inanimate things".&lt;ref name=Bechtel&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/philbio/vitalism.htm |author=Bechtel, William; Williamson, Robert C. |year=1998 |title=Vitalism |editor=E.

In the 18th and 19th centuries vitalism was [[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|discussed among biologists]], between those who felt that the known mechanics of physics would eventually explain the difference between life and non-life and vitalists who argued that the processes of life could not be reduced to a mechanistic process. Some vitalist biologists proposed [[Falsifiability|testable hypotheses]] meant to show inadequacies with mechanistic explanations, but these experiments failed to provide support for vitalism. Biologists now consider vitalism in this sense to have been refuted by [[Scientific evidence|empirical evidence]], and hence regard it as a [[Superseded scientific theories|superseded scientific theory]].&lt;ref name="Williams2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Elizabeth Ann |title=A Cultural History of Medical Vitalism in Enlightenment Montpellier |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AvqYl4sdwaYC&amp;pg=PA4 |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=978-0-7546-0881-3 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitalism has a long history in [[medical]] philosophies: many [[traditional medicine|traditional healing]] practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces.

== History ==

===Ancient times===
The notion that bodily functions are due to a vitalistic principle existing in all living creatures has roots going back at least to ancient [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jidenu, Paulin (1996) ''African Philosophy, 2nd Ed.'' Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-21096-8}}, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek philosophy]], the [[Milesian school]] proposed natural explanations [[deductive argument|deduced]] from [[materialism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]]. However, by the time of [[Lucretius]], this account was supplemented, (for example, by the unpredictable ''[[clinamen]]'' of [[Epicurus]]), and in [[Stoic physics]], the ''[[pneuma]]'' assumed the role of ''[[logos]]''. [[Galen]] believed the lungs draw pneuma from the air, which the blood communicates throughout the body.&lt;ref&gt;Birch, Charles; Cobb, John B. ''The Liberation of Life: From the Cell to the Community'', 1985, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
In Europe, medieval physics was influenced by the idea of pneuma, helping to shape later [[aether theories]].

===Early modern===
Vitalists included English anatomist [[Francis Glisson]] (1597–1677) and the Italian doctor [[Marcello Malpighi]] (1628–1694).&lt;ref name="Charles Birch 1985, pp. 76"&gt;Birch, Charles; Cobb, John B. ''The Liberation of Life: From the Cell to the Community'', 1985, pp. 76–78&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caspar Friedrich Wolff]] (1733–1794) is considered to be the father of [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]] in [[embryology]], that is, he marks the point when embryonic development began to be described in terms of the proliferation of cells rather than the incarnation of a preformed soul. However, this degree of empirical observation was not matched by a mechanistic philosophy: in his ''[[Theoria Generationis]]'' (1759), he tried to explain the emergence of the organism by the actions of a ''vis essentialis'' (an organizing, formative force), stating "All believers in epigenesis are vitalists." [[Carl Reichenbach]] (1788–1869) later developed the theory of [[Odic force]], a form of life-energy that permeates living things.

In the 17th century, modern science responded to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[action at a distance]] and the mechanism of [[Cartesian dualism]] with vitalist theories: that whereas the chemical transformations undergone by non-living substances are reversible, so-called "organic" matter is permanently altered by chemical transformations (such as cooking).&lt;ref name=Ede/&gt;

[[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] was influential in establishing epigenesis in the life sciences in 1781 with his publication of ''Über den Bildungstrieb und das Zeugungsgeschäfte''. Blumenbach cut up freshwater ''[[Hydra (zoology)|Hydra]]'' and established that the removed parts would regenerate. He inferred the presence of a "formative drive" (''Bildungstrieb'') in living matter. But he pointed out that this name, "like names applied to every other kind of vital power, of itself, explains nothing: it serves merely to designate a peculiar power formed by the combination of the mechanical principle with that which is susceptible of modification". In the early 18th century, the physicians [[Marie François Xavier Bichat]] and [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] recognized a "living principle" in addition to mechanics.&lt;ref name="Charles Birch 1985, pp. 76" /&gt;

[[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], one of the early 19th century fathers of modern [[chemistry]], argued that a regulative force must exist within living matter to maintain its functions.&lt;ref name=Ede&gt;Ede, Andrew. (2007) ''The Rise and Decline of Colloid Science in North America, 1900–1935: The Neglected Dimension'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Vitalist chemists predicted that organic materials could not be synthesized from inorganic components, but [[Friedrich Wöhler]] synthesised [[urea]] from inorganic components in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&amp;ProduktNr=223979&amp;Ausgabe=225203&amp;ArtikelNr=13463&amp;filename=13463.pdf Vitalism and Synthesis of Urea]&lt;/ref&gt; However, contemporary accounts do not support the common belief that vitalism died when Wöhler made urea. This ''Wöhler Myth'', as historian Peter Ramberg called it, originated from a popular history of chemistry published in 1931, which, "ignoring all pretense of historical accuracy, turned Wöhler into a crusader who made attempt after attempt to synthesize a natural product that would refute vitalism and lift the veil of ignorance, until 'one afternoon the miracle happened'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioethicsjournal.com/past/cheng.html ''The Real Death of Vitalism: Implications of the Wöhler Myth'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schummer, J. http://www.joachimschummer.net/papers/2003_NatureChemistry_SHPS.pdf, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1845, [[Adolph Kolbe]] succeeded in making acetic acid from inorganic compounds, and in the 1850s, [[Marcellin Berthelot]] repeated this feat for numerous organic compounds. In retrospect, Wöhler's work was the beginning of the end of Berzelius's vitalist hypothesis, but only in retrospect, as Ramberg had shown.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1833 and 1844, [[Johannes Peter Müller]] wrote a book on [[physiology]] called ''Handbuch der Physiologie'', which became the leading textbook in the field for much of the nineteenth century. The book showed Müller's commitments to vitalism; he questioned why organic matter differs from inorganic, then proceeded to chemical analyses of the blood and lymph. He describes in detail the circulatory, lymphatic, respiratory, digestive, endocrine, nervous, and sensory systems in a wide variety of animals but explains that the presence of a [[soul]] makes each organism an indivisible whole. He also claimed the behavior of light and sound waves showed that living organisms possessed a life-energy for which physical laws could never fully account.&lt;ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=February 2015}} http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/pdfgen/essays/enc22.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895) after his famous rebuttal of [[spontaneous generation]], performed several experiments that he felt supported vitalism. According to Bechtel, Pasteur "fitted fermentation into a more general programme describing special reactions that only occur in living organisms. These are irreducibly vital phenomena." Rejecting the claims of Berzelius, [[Liebig]], [[Moritz Traube|Traube]] and others that fermentation resulted from chemical agents or catalysts within cells, Pasteur concluded that fermentation was a "vital action".&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt;

===20th century===

[[Hans Driesch]] (1867–1941) interpreted his experiments as showing that life is not run by physicochemical laws.&lt;ref name="DevBio"&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2015}}[http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=10&amp;id=110 Developmental Biology 8e Online: A Selective History of Induction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031180529/http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=10&amp;id=110 |date=2006-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His main argument was that when one cuts up an embryo after its first division or two, each part grows into a complete adult. Driesch's reputation as an experimental biologist deteriorated as a result of his vitalistic theories, which scientists have seen since his time as pseudoscience.&lt;ref name="DevBio" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ps&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sebastian Normandin |author2=Charles T.

Other vitalists included [[Johannes Reinke]] and [[Oscar Hertwig]]. Reinke used the word ''neovitalism'' to describe his work, claiming that it would eventually be verified through experimentation, and that it was an improvement over the other vitalistic theories. The work of Reinke influenced [[Carl Jung]].&lt;ref&gt;Noll, Richard. "Jung's Concept of Die Dominanten (The Dominants)". https://www.academia.edu/6789277/Jungs_concept_of_die_Dominanten_the_Dominants_1997_&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Scott Haldane]] adopted an anti-mechanist approach to biology and an [[idealist]] philosophy early on in his career. Haldane saw his work as a vindication of his belief that [[teleology]] was an essential concept in biology. His views became widely known with his first book ''Mechanism, life and personality'' in 1913.&lt;ref name="Peter J. Bowler 2001, pp. 168"&gt;Bowler, Peter J. Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; Haldane borrowed arguments from the vitalists to use against mechanism; however, he was not a vitalist. Haldane treated the organism as fundamental to biology: "we perceive the organism as a self-regulating entity", "every effort to analyze it into components that can be reduced to a mechanical explanation violates this central experience".&lt;ref name="Peter J. Bowler 2001, pp. 168" /&gt; The work of Haldane was an influence on [[organicism]].

Haldane also stated that a purely mechanist interpretation can not account for the characteristics of life. Haldane wrote a number of books in which he attempted to show the invalidity of both vitalism and mechanist approaches to science. Haldane explained:

{{quote|We must find a different theoretical basis of biology, based on the observation that all the phenomena concerned tend towards being so coordinated that they express what is normal for an adult organism.|&lt;ref name="Mark A. Bedau 2010, p. 95" /&gt;}}

By 1931, biologists had "almost unanimously abandoned vitalism as an acknowledged belief."&lt;ref name="Mark A. Bedau 2010, p. 95"&gt;Bedau, Mark A.; Cleland, Carol E. ''The Nature of Life: Classical and Contemporary Perspectives from Philosophy and Science'', 2010, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergentism ==
{{main|Emergentism}}

Some aspects of contemporary science make reference to [[emergence|emergent processes]]; those in which the properties of a system cannot be fully described in terms of the properties of the constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Schultz | first1=S.G. | title=A century of (epithelial) transport physiology: from vitalism to molecular cloning | journal=The American Journal of Physiology | volume=274 | issue=1 Pt 1 | pages=C13–23 | year=1998 | pmid=9458708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gilbert | first1=S.F. | last2=Sarkar | first2=S. | title=Embracing complexity: organicism for the 21st century | journal=Developmental Dynamics | volume=219 | issue=1 | pages=1–9 | year=2000 | pmid=10974666 | doi=10.1002/1097-0177(2000)9999:9999&lt;::AID-DVDY1036&gt;3.0.CO;2-A }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be because the properties of the constituents are not fully understood, or because the interactions between the individual constituents are also important for the behavior of the system.

Whether emergence should be grouped with traditional vitalist concepts is a matter of semantic controversy.&lt;ref&gt;see "Emergent Properties" in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. online at [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties-emergent/ Stanford University] for explicit discussion; briefly, some philosophers see emergentism as midway between traditional spiritual vitalism and mechanistic reductionism; others argue that, structurally, emergentism is equivalent to vitalism. See also Emmeche C (2001) Does a robot have an Umwelt? ''Semiotica'' 134: 653–693 [http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/cePubl/2001d.robumwelt.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Emmeche ''et al.'' (1997):

{{quote|On the one hand, many scientists and philosophers regard emergence as having only a pseudo-scientific status. On the other hand, new developments in physics, biology, psychology, and cross-disciplinary fields such as cognitive science, artificial life, and the study of non-linear dynamical systems have focused strongly on the high level 'collective behaviour' of complex systems, which is often said to be truly emergent, and the term is increasingly used to characterize such systems.|&lt;ref name="Emmeche 1997"&gt;Emmeche C (1997) Explaining Emergence: towards an ontology of levels.

Emmeche ''et al.'' (1998) state that "there is a very important difference between the vitalists and the emergentists: the vitalist's creative forces were relevant only in organic substances, not in inorganic matter. Emergence hence is creation of new properties regardless of the substance involved." "The assumption of an extra-physical vitalis (vital force, [[entelechy]], [[élan vital]], etc.), as formulated in most forms (old or new) of vitalism, is usually without any genuine explanatory power. It has served altogether too often as an intellectual tranquilizer or verbal sedative—stifling scientific inquiry rather than encouraging it to proceed in new directions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 Dictionary of the History of Ideas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511191629/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 |date=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mesmerism ==
{{main|Animal magnetism}}
[[File:Franz Anton Mesmer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Mesmer]] proposed the vitalist force of ''[[animal magnetism|magnétisme animal]]'' in animals with breath.]]

A popular vitalist theory of the 18th century was "[[animal magnetism]]", in the theories of [[Franz Mesmer]] (1734–1815). However, the use of the (conventional) English term ''animal magnetism'' to translate Mesmer's '''magnétisme animal''' can be misleading for three reasons:
* Mesmer chose his term to clearly distinguish his variant of ''magnetic'' force from those referred to, at that time, as ''mineral magnetism'', ''cosmic magnetism'' and ''planetary magnetism''.
* Mesmer felt that this particular force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals.
* Mesmer chose the word "''animal''," for its root meaning (from Latin ''animus''="breath") specifically to identify his force as a quality that belonged to all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans '''and''' animals.

Mesmer's ideas became so influential that King [[Louis XVI]] of France appointed two commissions to investigate [[mesmerism]]; one was led by [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]], the other, led by [[Benjamin Franklin]], included [[Jean Sylvain Bailly|Bailly]] and [[Lavoisier]]. The commissioners learned about Mesmeric theory, and saw its patients fall into fits and [[trance]]s. In Franklin's garden, a patient was led to each of five trees, one of which had been "mesmerized"; he hugged each in turn to receive the "vital fluid," but fainted at the foot of a 'wrong' one. At Lavoisier's house, four normal cups of water were held before a "sensitive" woman; the fourth produced convulsions, but she calmly swallowed the mesmerized contents of a fifth, believing it to be plain water. The commissioners concluded that "the fluid without imagination is powerless, whereas imagination without the fluid can produce the effects of the fluid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Best | first1=M. | last2=Neuhauser | first2=D. | last3=Slavin | first3=L. | title=Evaluating Mesmerism, Paris, 1784: the controversy over the blinded placebo controlled trials has not stopped | url=http://qhc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/12/3/232 | journal=Quality &amp; safety in health care | volume=12 | issue=3 | pages=232–3 | year=2003 | pmid=12792017 | pmc=1743715 | doi=10.1136/qhc.12.3.232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical philosophies ==

Vitalism has a long history in [[medical]] philosophies: many [[traditional medicine|traditional healing]] practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces. In the Western tradition founded by [[Hippocrates]], these vital forces were associated with the [[four temperaments]] and [[The four humours|humours]]; Eastern traditions posited an imbalance or blocking of [[qi]] or [[prana]]. One example of a similar notion in Africa is the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] concept of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]. Today forms of vitalism continue to exist as philosophical positions or as tenets in some religious traditions.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[Complementary and alternative medicine]] therapies include [[energy therapy|energy therapies]],&lt;ref name="titleComplementary and Alternative Medicine – U.S. National Library of Medicine Collection Development Manual"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/subjects24.html |title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine – U.S. National Library of Medicine Collection Development Manual |accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with vitalism, especially biofield therapies such as [[therapeutic touch]], [[Reiki]], external [[qi]], [[chakra]] healing and SHEN therapy.&lt;ref name="Rubik"&gt;Rubik, ''Bioenergetic Medicines'', American Medical Student Association Foundation, viewed 28 November 2006, {{cite web |url=http://www.amsa.org/ICAM/C6.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214125248/https://www.amsa.org/ICAM/C6.doc |archivedate=2006-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these therapies, the "[[subtle energy]]" field of a patient is manipulated by a  practitioner. The subtle energy is held to exist beyond the electromagnetic energy produced by the heart and brain. Beverly Rubik describes the biofield as a "complex, dynamic, extremely weak EM field within and around the human body...."&lt;ref name="Rubik" /&gt;

The founder of [[homeopathy]], [[Samuel Hahnemann]], promoted an immaterial, vitalistic view of disease: "...they are solely spirit-like (dynamic) derangements of the spirit-like power (the vital principle) that animates the human body." The view of disease as a dynamic disturbance of the immaterial and dynamic vital force is taught in many homeopathic colleges and constitutes a fundamental principle for many contemporary practising homeopaths.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Criticism ==
[[File:Pierre Mignard - Portrait de Jean-Baptiste Poquelin dit Molière (1622-1673) - Google Art Project (cropped).jpg|thumb|The 17th century French playwright [[Molière]] mocked vitalism in his 1673 play ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]''.]]

Vitalism has sometimes been criticized as begging the question by inventing a name. [[Molière]] had famously parodied this fallacy in ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]'', where a quack "answers" the question of "Why does [[opium]] cause sleep?" with "Because of its '''dormitive virtue''' (i.e., [[soporific]] power)."&lt;ref name="fr.wikisource.org"&gt;'' Mihi a docto doctore / Demandatur causam et rationem quare / Opium facit dormire. / A quoi respondeo, / Quia est in eo / Vertus dormitiva, / Cujus est natura / Sensus assoupire.'' [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Malade_imaginaire_-_3%C3%A8me_interm%C3%A8de Le Malade imaginaire, (French Wikisource)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] compared vitalism to stating that water is the way it is because of its "aquosity".&lt;ref name="The Physical Basis of Life"&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/comm/PMG/PBofL.html The Physical Basis of Life], ''Pall Mall Gazette'', 1869&lt;/ref&gt; His grandson [[Julian Huxley]] in 1926 compared "vital force" or ''élan vital'' to explaining a railroad locomotive's operation by its ''élan locomotif'' ("locomotive force").

Another criticism is that vitalists have failed to rule out mechanistic explanations. This is rather obvious in retrospect for [[organic chemistry]] and [[developmental biology]], but the criticism goes back at least a century. In 1912, [[Jacques Loeb]] published ''The Mechanistic Conception of Life'', in which he described experiments on how a sea urchin could have a pin for its father, as [[Bertrand Russell]] put it (''Religion and Science''). He offered this challenge:

: "... we must either succeed in producing living matter artificially, or we must find the reasons why this is impossible." (pp.&amp;nbsp;5–6)

Loeb addressed vitalism more explicitly:

: "It is, therefore, unwarranted to continue the statement that in addition to the acceleration of oxidations the beginning of individual life is determined by the entrance of a metaphysical "life principle" into the egg; and that death is determined, aside from the cessation of oxidations, by the departure of this "principle" from the body. In the case of the evaporation of water we are satisfied with the explanation given by the kinetic theory of gases and do not demand that to repeat a well-known jest of Huxley the disappearance of the "aquosity" be also taken into consideration." (pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15)

Bechtel states that vitalism "is often viewed as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]], and therefore a pernicious metaphysical doctrine."&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt; For many scientists, "vitalist" theories were unsatisfactory "holding positions" on the pathway to mechanistic understanding. In 1967, [[Francis Crick]], the co-discoverer of the structure of [[DNA]], stated "And so to those of you who may be vitalists I would make this prophecy: what everyone believed yesterday, and you believe today, only [[Crank (person)|cranks]] will believe tomorrow."&lt;ref name="Crick"&gt;Crick, Francis (1967) ''Of Molecules and Men''; Great Minds Series Prometheus Books 2004, reviewed [http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/reviews/crickandkurtz.htm here]. Crick's remark is cited and discussed in: Hein H (2004) [http://www.springerlink.com/content/m821384707h6h254/fulltext.pdf Molecular biology vs. organicism: The enduring dispute between mechanism and vitalism.] ''Synthese'' 20:238–253, who describes Crick's remark as "raising spectral red herrings".&lt;/ref&gt;

While many vitalistic theories have in fact been falsified, notably Mesmerism, the [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] retention of untested and untestable theories continues to this day. [[Alan Sokal]] published an analysis of the wide acceptance among professional nurses of "scientific theories" of spiritual healing. (Pseudoscience and Postmodernism: Antagonists or Fellow-Travelers?).&lt;ref name="Sokal"&gt;[http://physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/pseudoscience_rev.pdf Pseudoscience and Postmodernism: Antagonists or Fellow-Travelers?]&lt;/ref&gt; Use of a technique called [[therapeutic touch]] was especially reviewed by Sokal, who concluded, "nearly all the pseudoscientific systems to be examined in this essay are based philosophically on vitalism" and added that "Mainstream science has rejected vitalism since at least the 1930s, for a plethora of good reasons that have only become stronger with time."&lt;ref name="Sokal" /&gt;

Joseph C. Keating, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncmic.com/pages/ce/seminars/speakers/keating.htm Joseph C. Keating, Jr., PhD: Biographical sketch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525203939/http://www.ncmic.com/pages/ce/seminars/speakers/keating.htm |date=2006-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses vitalism's past and present roles in [[chiropractic]] and calls vitalism "a form of [[bio-theology]]." He further explains that:

: "Vitalism is that rejected tradition in biology which proposes that life is sustained and explained by an unmeasurable, intelligent force or energy. The supposed effects of vitalism are the manifestations of life itself, which in turn are the basis for inferring the concept in the first place. This circular reasoning offers pseudo-explanation, and may deceive us into believing we have explained some aspect of biology when in fact we have only labeled our ignorance. 'Explaining an unknown (life) with an unknowable (Innate),' suggests chiropractor Joseph Donahue, 'is absurd'."&lt;ref name="keating_innate"&gt;{{citation |title=The Meanings of Innate |author=Keating, Joseph C.  |volume=46 |issue=1 |pmc=2505097 |journal=The Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association |year=2002 |pages=4–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keating views vitalism as incompatible with scientific thinking:

: "Chiropractors are not unique in recognizing a tendency and capacity for self-repair and auto-regulation of human physiology. But we surely stick out like a sore thumb among professions which claim to be scientifically based by our unrelenting commitment to vitalism. So long as we propound the 'One cause, one cure' rhetoric of Innate, we should expect to be met by ridicule from the wider health science community. Chiropractors can't have it both ways. Our theories cannot be both dogmatically held vitalistic constructs and be scientific at the same time. The purposiveness, consciousness and rigidity of the Palmers' Innate should be rejected."&lt;ref name="keating_innate" /&gt;

Keating also mentions Skinner's viewpoint:

: "Vitalism has many faces and has sprung up in many areas of scientific inquiry. Psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]], for example, pointed out the irrationality of attributing behavior to mental states and traits. Such 'mental way stations,' he argued, amount to excess theoretical baggage which fails to advance cause-and-effect explanations by substituting an unfathomable psychology of 'mind'."&lt;ref name="keating_innate" /&gt;

According to Williams,&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, W. (2000) ''The [[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience]]. From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy''. Facts on File. Conway, D. and L. Dalton, R. Dolby, R. Duval, H. Farrell, J. Frazier, J. McMillan, J. Melton, T. O'Niell, R. Shepherd, S. Utley, W. Williams. {{ISBN|0-8160-3351-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; "today, vitalism is one of the ideas that form the basis for many pseudoscientific health systems that claim that illnesses are caused by a disturbance or imbalance of the body's vital force." "Vitalists claim to be scientific, but in fact they reject the scientific method with its basic postulates of cause and effect and of provability. They often regard subjective experience to be more valid than objective material reality."

This is not, however, what the new vitalists have in mind. They imagine the [[Energy (esotericism)|bioenergetic]] field as a holistic living force that goes beyond reductionist physics and chemistry."&lt;ref name=Stenger&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stenger |first=Victor J. |title=The Physics of 'Alternative Medicine': Bioenergetic Fields |journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine |date=Spring–Summer 1999 |volume=3 |issue=1 |url=http://www.sram.org/0301/bioenergetic-fields.html |authorlink=Victor_J_Stenger |access-date=2006-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218144228/http://www.sram.org/0301/bioenergetic-fields.html |archive-date=2006-12-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a field is sometimes explained as electromagnetic, though some advocates also make confused appeals to quantum physics.&lt;ref name="Rubik" /&gt; Joanne Stefanatos states that "The principles of energy medicine originate in quantum physics."&lt;ref name="Stefanatos"&gt;Stefanatos, J. 1997, ''Introduction to Bioenergetic Medicine'', Shoen, A.M. and S.G. Wynn, ''Complementary and Alternative Veterinary Medicine: Principles and Practices'', Mosby-Yearbook, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; Stenger&lt;ref name="Stenger" /&gt; offers several explanations as to why this line of reasoning may be misplaced. He explains that energy exists in discrete packets called quanta. Energy fields are composed of their component parts and so only exist when quanta are present. Therefore, energy fields are not holistic, but are rather a system of discrete parts that must obey the laws of physics. This also means that energy fields are not instantaneous. These facts of quantum physics place limitations on the infinite, continuous field that is used by some theorists to describe so-called "human energy fields".&lt;ref name="Biley"&gt;Biley, Francis C. 2005, ''Unitary Health Care: Martha Rogers' Science of Unitary Human Beings'', University of Wales College of Medicine, viewed 30 November 2006, {{cite web |url=http://medweb.uwcm.ac.uk/martha/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205024515/http://medweb.uwcm.ac.uk/martha/ |archivedate=2006-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stenger continues, explaining that the effects of EM forces have been measured by physicists as accurately as one part in a billion and there is yet to be any evidence that living organisms emit a unique field.&lt;ref name="Stenger" /&gt;

Vitalistic thinking has also been identified in the naive biological theories of children: "Recent experimental results show that a majority of preschoolers tend to choose vitalistic explanations as most plausible. Vitalism, together with other forms of intermediate causality, constitute unique causal devices for naive biology as a core domain of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.06.004 | last1=Inagaki | first1=K. | last2=Hatano | first2=G. | year=2004 | title='Vitalistic causality in young children's naive biology.' | url=| journal=Trends Cogn Sci | volume=8 | issue=8| pages=356–62 | pmid=15335462 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''weasel program''' or '''Dawkins' weasel''' is a [[thought experiment]] and a variety of [[computer simulation]]s illustrating it.  Their aim is to demonstrate that the process that drives [[evolution]]ary systems—random [[Mutation|variation]] combined with non-random cumulative [[Selection (biology)|selection]]—is different from pure [[chance (philosophy)|chance]].

The thought experiment was formulated by [[Richard Dawkins]], and the first simulation written by him; various other implementations of the program have been written by others.

== Overview ==
In chapter 3 of his book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', Dawkins gave the following introduction to the program, referencing the well-known [[infinite monkey theorem]]:

{{quote|I don't know who it was first pointed out that, given enough time, a [[monkey]] bashing away at [[Randomness|random]] on a [[typewriter]] could produce all the works of [[Shakespeare]]. The operative phrase is, of course, given enough time. Let us limit the task facing our monkey somewhat. Suppose that he has to produce, not the complete works of Shakespeare but just the short sentence 'Methinks it is like a [[weasel]]', and we shall make it relatively easy by giving him a typewriter with a restricted keyboard, one with just the 26 (capital) letters, and a space bar. How long will he take to write this one little sentence?}}

The scenario is staged to produce a string of [[gibberish]] letters, assuming that the selection of each letter in a sequence of 28 characters will be random. The number of possible combinations in this random sequence is 27&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;, or about 10&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;, so the [[probability]] that the monkey will produce a given sequence is extremely low. Any particular sequence of 28 characters could be selected as a "target" phrase, all equally as improbable as Dawkins's chosen target, "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL".

A [[computer program]] could be written to carry out the actions of Dawkins's [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] monkey, continuously generating combinations of 26 letters and spaces at high speed. Even at the rate of millions of combinations per second, it is unlikely, even given the entire [[Age of the universe|lifetime of the universe]] to run, that the program would ever produce the phrase "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL".&lt;ref&gt;For a string of 28 characters, with 27 possible characters (A-Z plus space), any randomly generated string has the probability one in 27^28 of being correct; that is approximately one in 10^40. If a program generating 10 million strings per second had been running since the start of the universe (around 14 billion years, or 10^17 seconds), it would have only generated around 10^24 strings by now.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins intends this example to illustrate a common misunderstanding of [[evolution]]ary change, i.e. that [[DNA]] sequences or [[organic compound]]s such as [[proteins]] are the result of atoms randomly combining to form more complex structures. In these types of computations, any sequence of [[amino acids]] in a protein will be extraordinarily improbable (this is known as [[Hoyle's fallacy]]). Rather, evolution proceeds by [[hill climbing]], as in [[adaptive landscape]]s.

Dawkins then goes on to show that a process of ''cumulative'' selection can take far fewer steps to reach any given target. In Dawkins's words:

{{quote|We again use our computer monkey, but with a crucial difference in its program. It again begins by choosing a random sequence of 28 letters, just as before ... it duplicates it repeatedly, but with a certain chance of random [[error]] &amp;ndash; 'mutation' &amp;ndash; in the copying. The computer examines the [[mutant]] nonsense phrases, the 'progeny' of the original phrase, and chooses the one which,'' however slightly, ''most resembles the target phrase, METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL.}}

By repeating the procedure, a randomly generated sequence of 28 letters and spaces will be gradually changed each [[generation]]. The sequences progress through each generation:

:Generation&amp;nbsp;01:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;WDLTMNLT&amp;nbsp;DTJBKWIRZREZLMQCO&amp;nbsp;P&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Note: the 4th character of line 1 is missing in Dawkins' text; however line 2 suggests it was probably a T&lt;/ref&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;02:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;WDLTMNLT&amp;nbsp;DTJBSWIRZREZLMQCO&amp;nbsp;P&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;10:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;MDLDMNLS&amp;nbsp;ITJISWHRZREZ&amp;nbsp;MECS&amp;nbsp;P&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;20:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;MELDINLS&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;ISWPRKE&amp;nbsp;Z&amp;nbsp;WECSEL&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;30:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;METHINGS&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;ISWLIKE&amp;nbsp;B&amp;nbsp;WECSEL&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;40:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;METHINKS&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;IS&amp;nbsp;LIKE&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;WEASEL&lt;/tt&gt;
:Generation&amp;nbsp;43:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;METHINKS&amp;nbsp;IT&amp;nbsp;IS&amp;nbsp;LIKE&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;WEASEL&lt;/tt&gt;

Dawkins continues:

{{quote|The exact time taken by the computer to reach the target doesn't matter. If you want to know, it completed the whole exercise for me, the first time, while I was out to lunch. It took about half an hour. (Computer enthusiasts may think this unduly slow. The reason is that the program was written in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], a sort of computer baby-talk. When I rewrote it in [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], it took 11 seconds.) Computers are a bit faster at this kind of thing than monkeys, but the difference really isn't significant. What matters is the difference between the time taken by'' cumulative ''selection, and the time which the same computer, working flat out at the same rate, would take to reach the target phrase if it were forced to use the other procedure of'' single-step selection: ''about a million million million million million years. This is more than a million million million times as long as the universe has so far existed.}}

==Implications for biology==
The program aims to demonstrate that the preservation of small changes in an evolving string of characters (or [[gene]]s) can produce meaningful combinations in a relatively short time as long as there is some mechanism to select cumulative changes, whether it is a person identifying which traits are desirable (in the case of artificial selection) or a criterion of survival ("fitness") imposed by the environment (in the case of natural selection). Reproducing systems tend to preserve traits across generations, because the offspring inherit a copy of the parent's traits. It is the differences between offspring, the variations in copying, which become the basis for selection, allowing phrases closer to the target to survive, and the remaining variants to "die."

Dawkins discusses the issue of the mechanism of selection with respect to his "biomorphs" program:

{{quote|The human eye has an active role to play in the story. It is the selecting agent. It surveys the litter of progeny and chooses one for breeding. ...Our model, in other words, is strictly a model of artificial selection, not natural selection. The criterion for 'success' is not the direct criterion of survival, as it is in true natural selection. In true natural selection, if a body has what it takes to survive, its genes automatically survive because they are inside it. So the genes that survive tend to be, automatically, those genes that confer on bodies the qualities that assist them to survive.}}

Regarding the example's applicability to biological evolution, he is careful to point out that it has its limitations:

{{quote|Although the monkey/Shakespeare model is useful for explaining the distinction between single-step selection and cumulative selection, it is misleading in important ways. One of these is that, in each generation of selective 'breeding', the mutant 'progeny' phrases were judged according to the criterion of resemblance to a'' distant ideal ''target, the phrase METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL. Life isn't like that. Evolution has no long-term goal. There is no long-distance target, no final perfection to serve as a criterion for selection, although human vanity cherishes the absurd notion that our species is the final goal of evolution. In real life, the criterion for selection is always short-term, either simple survival or, more generally, reproductive success.}}

[[File:Dawkins-Weasel.png|thumb | A full run of a weasel program, with 100 offspring per generation, and a 5% mutation chance per character copied. Only the "fittest" string of each generation is shown. Note that, in generation 8, the 25th character, which had been correct (&lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;), becomes incorrect (&lt;code&gt;I&lt;/code&gt;). The program does not "lock" correct characters, rather it measures at each iteration the closeness of the complete string to the 'target' phrase.]]

==More complex models==
In ''The Blind Watchmaker,'' Dawkins goes on to provide a graphical model of [[gene selection]] involving  entities he calls biomorphs. These are [[Plane (mathematics)|two-dimensional]] sets of [[Line (mathematics)#Line segment|line segments]] which bear relationships to each other, drawn under the control of "genes" that determine the appearance of the biomorph. By selecting entities from sequential generations of biomorphs, an experimenter can guide the evolution of the figures toward given shapes, such as "airplane" or "octopus" biomorphs.

As a simulation, the biomorphs are not much closer to the actual genetic behavior of biological organisms. Like the Weasel program, their development is shaped by an external factor, in this case the decisions of the experimenter who chooses which of many possible shapes will go forward into the following generation. They do however serve to illustrate the concept of "genetic space," where each possible gene is treated as a [[dimension]], and the actual genomes of living organisms make up a tiny fraction of all possible gene combinations, most of which will not produce a viable organism. As Dawkins puts it, "however many ways there may be of being alive, it is certain that there are vastly more ways of being dead". 

In ''Climbing Mount Improbable'', Dawkins responded to the limitations of the Weasel program by describing programs, written by other parties, that modeled the evolution of the [[spider web]].  He suggested that these programs were more realistic models of the evolutionary process, since they had no predetermined goal other than coming up with a web that caught more flies through a "trial and error" process.  Spiderwebs were seen as good topics for evolutionary modeling because they were simple examples of biosystems that were easily visualized; the modeling programs successfully generated a range of spider webs similar to those found in nature.

== Example algorithm ==
{{or section|date=August 2016}}
Although Dawkins did not provide the source code for his program, a "Weasel" style algorithm could run as follows.

# Start with a random string of 28 characters.
# Make 100 copies of the string (''reproduce'').
# For each character in each of the 100 copies, with a probability of 5%, replace (''mutate'') the character with a new random character.
#  Compare each new string with the target string "METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL", and give each a score (the number of letters in the string that are correct and in the correct position).
# If any of the new strings has a perfect score (28), halt. Otherwise, take the highest scoring string, and go to step 2.

For these purposes, a "character" is any uppercase letter, or a space. The number of copies per generation, and the chance of mutation per letter are not specified in Dawkins's book; 100 copies and a 5% mutation rate are examples. Correct letters are not "locked". Each correct letter may become incorrect in subsequent generations. The terms of the program and the existence of the target phrase do however mean that such 'negative mutations' will quickly be 'corrected'.
