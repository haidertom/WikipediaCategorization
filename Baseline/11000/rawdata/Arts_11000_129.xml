      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2851">'''All-over painting''' refers to the non-differential treatment of the surface of a work of two-dimensional art, for instance a painting. This concept is most popularly thought of as emerging in relation to the so-called "drip" paintings of [[Jackson Pollock]] and the "automatic writing" or "abstract calligraphy" of [[Mark Tobey]] in the 1950s, though the applicability of the term all-over painting would be wider than that. "All-over painting" is not a formal style of painting and the term does not represent an "[[art movement]]." Some painting under the heading [[color field]] painting displays the "all-over" painting style. Such a painting would fail to treat the top, for instance, differently from the bottom; the left than the right. Uniform treatment of all sections of the surface are the hallmark of all-over painting. All-over paintings would lack a dominant point of interest, or any indication of which way is "up." Some paintings by [[Cy Twombly]] have had this term applied to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O5-alloverpainting.html |title=all-over painting Facts, information, pictures &amp;#124; Encyclopedia.com articles about all-over painting |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/all-over-painting ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007141533/http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/all-over-painting |date=October 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artprofessor.com/art-movements/all-over-painting.php |title=All-over Painting |publisher=Artprofessor.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Al.html |title=ArtLex's Al-Am page |publisher=Artlex.com |date=2007-02-16 |accessdate=2012-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705050409/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Al.html |archive-date=2012-07-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/library/00/0019/t001940.asp |title=Directory of Art Services and Resources |publisher=artnet |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It is not known why the stone was created.  The stone was found by the [[Enga people|Enga]] of [[Papua New Guinea]], and was thought to have [[ritual]] significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Egloff|first1=Brian|title=Bones of the Ancestors: The Ambum Stone : from the New Guinea Highlands to the Antiquities Market to Australia|date=20 March 2008|publisher=AltaMira Press|isbn=9780759111608}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found in a cave in the early 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ambum Stone|url=http://nga.gov.au/AmbumStone/|website=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1977, was acquired by the [[National Gallery of Australia]]. Some suspect that the stone was illegally exported from Papua New Guinea to be able to land in the National Gallery of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Craig|first1=Barry|title=Review of Bones of the Ancestors.

==Artifact damaged==
In May 2000, the artifact was damaged while it was on loan to the Museum of African Arts, Pacific and Indian. It broke into three main segments: the head, the body, and a chip off the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Object conservation: Aubum stone|url=http://nga.gov.au/Conservation/Objects/ambum.cfm|website=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the artifact incurred several minor "bruises". It was later restored using adhesive and an inpaint to match the finish.

'''Anne Whateley''' is the name given to a woman who is sometimes supposed to have been the intended wife of [[William Shakespeare]] before he married [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|Anne Hathaway]]. Most scholars believe that Whateley never existed, and that her name in a document concerning Shakespeare's marriage is merely a [[clerical error]]. However, several writers on Shakespeare have taken the view that she was a real rival to Hathaway for Shakespeare's hand. She has also appeared in imaginative literature on Shakespeare and in [[Shakespeare authorship question|Shakespeare authorship]] speculations. Shakespeare's biographer Russell A. Fraser describes her as "a ghost", "haunting the edges of Shakespeare's story".&lt;ref&gt;Russell Fraser, ''Shakespeare: A Life in Art'', Transaction Publishers, 2007, p.66.&lt;/ref&gt; She has also been called "the first of the Shakespearean Dark Ladies".&lt;ref&gt;Ivor Brown and George Fearon, ''Amazing monument : a short history of the Shakespeare industry'', Heinemann, 1939, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
Whateley's existence has been deduced from an entry in the Episcopal register at [[Worcester]] which states in Latin "Anno Domini 1582...Novembris...27 die eiusdem mensis. Item eodem die supradicto emanavit Licentia inter Wm Shaxpere et Annam Whateley de Temple Grafton." The entry states that a marriage licence has been issued to Shakespeare and Anne Whateley to marry in the village of [[Temple Grafton]]. The day afterwards, Fulk Sandells and John Richardson, friends of the Hathaway family from [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], signed a [[surety]] of £40 as a financial guarantee for the wedding of "William Shagspere and Anne Hathwey".&lt;ref name = "sam"&gt;Samuel Schoenbaum, ''William Shakespeare: a compact documentary life'', Oxford University Press, 1977, pp.84-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Chambers, ''William Shakespeare: A Study of the Facts and Problems'', Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.41-42. The marriage was registered in Worcester because William had killed someone important[[Anglican Diocese of Worcester]], which included southern Warwickshire.&lt;/ref&gt;

The entry in the register was discovered in the late nineteenth century by Reverend T.P. Wadley. Various explanations were offered. Initially it was assumed that Whateley was an alternative surname for Anne Hathaway herself. Wadley believed that it was probably an alias, used by Hathaway in order to keep the date of the marriage secret to obscure the fact that she was already pregnant. Another suggestion was that Anne Hathaway might legitimately have used the name, either because her father Richard Hathaway was in fact her step-father, her mother having previously been married to a man called Whateley, or because Anne herself may have previously been married to a man named Whateley.&lt;ref name = "gray"&gt;Joseph William Gray, ''Shakespeare's Marriage: His Departure from Stratford and Other Incidents in His Life'', Chapman and Hall, 1905, pp.13-18; 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; None of these suggestions gained support, since they contradicted other existing evidence.

[[File:Whateley note.JPG|thumb|left|The names of Shakespeare and Whateley in the note in the Episcopal register at Worcester]]
The Whateley note is discussed in [[Sidney Lee]]'s 1898 book ''A Life of William Shakespeare''. Lee argues that the "William Shakespeare" who is engaged to Whateley is probably a different person from the playwright, as there were "numerous William Shakespeares, who abounded in the diocese of Worcester".&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Lee, ''A life of William Shakespeare'', 1915 edition, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 Joseph William Gray in ''Shakespeare's Marriage'' gave a detailed argument for clerical error due to the existence of lawsuits involving Whateleys that were being written up by the same scribe.&lt;ref name = "gray"/&gt;&lt;ref name = ing&gt;William Ingram, ''The business of playing: the beginnings of the adult professional theater in Elizabethan London'', Cornell University Press, 1992, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; However in 1909 [[Frank Harris]] in his book ''The Man Shakespeare'' ignored Gray's argument and dismissed Lee's suggestion that there were two William Shakespeares as wildly implausible. He insisted that these documents are evidence that Shakespeare was involved with two separate women.  He intended to marry Anne Whateley, but, when this became known, he was immediately forced by Anne Hathaway's family to marry their relative, since he had already made her pregnant. Harris believed that Shakespeare despised his wife, and that his forced marriage was the spur to his creative work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Shakespeare had married Anne Whately he might never have gone to London or written a play. Shakespeare's hatred of his wife and his regret for having married her were alike foolish. Our brains are seldom the wisest part of us. It was well that he made love to Anne Hathaway; well, too, that he was forced to marry her; well, finally, that he should desert her. I am sorry he treated her badly and left her unsupplied with money; that was needlessly cruel; but it is just the kindliest men who have these extraordinary lapses; Shakespeare's loathing for his wife was measureless.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Harris, ''The Man Shakespeare'', BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2007, (reprint) p.362. Harris's spelling "Whatley" with one "e" is followed by several other authors, sometimes with the "e" before the "l". However, "Whateley" is the most common form of the name.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some biographers, notably [[Ivor Brown]] and [[Anthony Burgess]], followed Harris' lead, portraying Whateley as Shakespeare's true love. Brown argued that she was the Dark Lady of the sonnets. In 1970 Burgess wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is reasonable to believe that Will wished to marry a girl named Anne Whateley. The name is common enough in the Midlands and is even attached to a four-star hotel in Horse Fair, Banbury. Her father may have been a friend of John Shakespeare's, he may have sold kidskin cheap, there are various reasons why the Shakespeares and the Whateleys, or their nubile children, might become friendly. Sent on skin-buying errands to Temple Grafton, Will could have fallen for a comely daughter, sweet as May and shy as a fawn. He was eighteen and highly susceptible. Knowing something about girls, he would know that this was the real thing. Something, perhaps, quite different from what he felt about Mistress Hathaway of Shottery. But why, attempting to marry Anne Whateley, had he put himself in the position of having to marry the other Anne? I suggest that, to use the crude but convenient properties of the old women's-magazine morality-stories, he was exercised by love for the one and lust for the other.&lt;ref name = "sam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Burgess, ''Shakespeare'', London: Jonathan Cape, 1970, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Stanley Wells]] in the ''Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'', most modern scholars take the same view as Gray, that the name Whateley was "almost certainly the result of clerical error".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Wells, "Whateley, Anne". ''Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p.185; p.518. See also Park Honan, ''Shakespeare: a life'', Oxford University Press, 2000, p.84.&lt;/ref&gt; It may have arisen because the clerk was also recording information about a tithe appeal by a vicar, which included a reference to a person named Whateley.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Levi, ''The Life and Times of William Shakespeare'', London: Macmillan, 1988, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; Though there was a Whateley family in the area, no independent evidence has ever been found of the existence of an Anne Whateley in Temple Grafton or anywhere else nearby. As for Lee's claim that there were "numerous" other William Shakespeares in the diocese, later researchers have found no surviving records of any other William Shakespeares of marriageable age in the diocese of Worcester.&lt;ref name = ing/&gt;

==Authorship speculations==
{{main|Shakespeare authorship question}}
After Harris's initial argument a number of imaginative claims were made about Anne Whateley, most dramatically that she was the true author of Shakespeare's works. This argument was made by William Ross in his book ''The Story of Anne Whateley and William Shaxpere'' (1939),&lt;ref name = "quart"&gt;''Shakespeare Quarterly'', 1950-1, p.256&lt;/ref&gt; in which he asserted that Whateley was a nun who was his "lover and consort in their spiritual union". She was born in 1561, the daughter of the well-known seafarer [[Anthony Jenkinson]]. She was living a secluded life among the nuns of the [[Poor Clares|Order of St. Clare]] when she met Shakespeare. They fell in love, and Anne was about to leave the order to marry him when Hathaway revealed her pregnancy. Her authorship can be deduced from [[Shakespeare's sonnets|the sonnets]], which she wrote as gifts to Shakespeare. They describe the history of her spiritual relationship with him. Hathaway is the [[The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]] of the sonnets, while Shakespeare himself is the [[Fair Youth]]. Their intimate friendship continued after his marriage to Hathaway; its deepening spirituality is explored in the later sonnets. Eventually the friendship was broken up by Hathaway's jealousy, and Shakespeare left for London. She wrote ''[[A Lover's Complaint]]'', which was appended to the sonnets, to express Anne Hathaway's point of view.

Whateley wished to dedicate the sonnets to Shakespeare, but wrote the dedication to [[Mr W.H.]] instead of "W.S", so that the identity of her lost love should remain mysterious. "W.H" was preferred because it was the initials of both her own surname and Hathaway's, implying that Shakespeare was, in a sense, both their husbands: Mr W and Mr H. According to Ross, "the initials therefore represent all three, and no better selection was possible".&lt;ref name = "ross"&gt;William Ross,''The story of Anne Whateley and William Shaxpere as revealed by 'The sonnets to Mr. W.H.' and other Elizabethan poetry'', Holmes, 1939, p.122; p.207&lt;/ref&gt; She gave him the full collection when he left for London, which explains the dedication to the "well-wishing adventurer in setting forth". She later wrote ''[[The Phoenix and the Turtle]]'' to commemorate their spiritual union.

Ross emphasises that his discovery removes all suggestion of homoeroticism from the sonnets, and thus "the taint of perversion, so odious to all lovers of Shakespeare, has been dissipated". He has very little to say about the plays, but states that Whateley probably wrote Shakespeare's plays to help him make a living. Nevertheless he describes the playwriting as a "collaboration", though Shakespeare's role was probably "passive". Ross portrays Shakespeare himself as a talented writer, a worthy assistant to Whateley's "genius". After Anne's death he wrote "The Twenty-First and Last Book of the Ocean, to Cynthia", hitherto attributed to [[Walter Raleigh]].

Ross argues that the sonnets reveal that Whateley also knew [[Edmund Spenser]] and helped him to write ''[[The Shepherd's Calendar]]''. She was also the sole author of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' and ''[[Amoretti]]''. In the 1580s she met and helped [[Michael Drayton]] and [[Philip Sidney]], probably inspiring the sonnet revival of the period. The poem ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'', usually attributed to [[Christopher Marlowe]], describes her relationship with Shakespeare. She also wrote Marlowe's plays. After her death in 1600 her unpublished works were published in the book ''Poetical Rhapsody'', attributed to "A.W."&lt;ref name = "ross"/&gt;

Ross's speculations were developed by his friend W.J. Fraser Hutcheson in his book ''Shakespeare's Other Anne'' (1950).&lt;ref name ="hut"&gt;W.J. Fraser Hutcheson, ''Shakespeare's Other Anne: a short account of the life and works of Anne Whateley or Beck, a Sister of the Order of St. Clare, who nearly married William Shakespeare in November 1582 A.D.'', William MacLellan, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; He follows Ross's claim that Whateley's father was Jenkinson, adding that Whateley's real name was Elizabeth Anne Beck and that her mother was an Anne Beck who died in childbirth. She used the name Whateley because of the household in which she grew up. Falling in love with Shakespeare, she was broken-hearted when he married Hathaway. She fled to Italy, where she acquired the knowledge that would later be used in Shakespeare's Italian plays. Many of her works were published under the name "Ignotus".&lt;ref name = "quart"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="hut"/&gt; Hutcheson also claims to have identified a portrait of Whateley, the work of [[Sofonisba Anguissola]], the several copies of which attest to the esteem in which she was held. Hutcheson suggests that Whateley is portrayed as Rosalind and other female characters in Shakespeare's plays. While insisting that she inspired the plays, he does not explicitly assert that she wrote them.

Neither Ross nor Hutcheson provide documentary evidence to support their theories.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick S. Boas, ''The Year's Work in English Studies'', Vol. XXXI, 1950, OUP, 1952, p.113; George L. McMichael, Edgar M. Glenn, ''Shakespeare and his rivals: a casebook on the authorship controversy'', Odyssey Press, 1962, p.145ff&lt;/ref&gt; Ross relies on his readings of the poems while Hutcheson finds coded messages in texts and images. The portrait he identifies as Whateley is generally believed to depict the courtier and poet Girolamo Casio.&lt;ref name = "pea"/&gt; It is  attributed to [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]], rather than Anguissola, and its likely depiction of Casio was accepted long before he wrote the book.&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Herbert Baily 
(ed), ''The Connoisseur'', 1908, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of other alternative authorship theories have also used Frank Harris' version of the Anne Whateley story, typically to portray Shakespeare as a duplicitous scapegrace, traits which are supposed to disqualify him as an author of great poetry.&lt;ref&gt;H. N. Gibson, ''The Shakespeare Claimants'', Routledge, 2005, pp.41-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Frazer, who believed that [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|The Earl of Derby]] wrote the canon, argued that Shakespeare actually married Whateley, not Hathaway.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Frazer, The Silent Shakespeare, Philadelphia, (1915), p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Anne has also appeared in imaginative literature about Shakespeare, typically portrayed as Shakespeare's true love, in contrast to a less appealing Anne Hathaway. Anne appears in [[Hubert Osborne]]'s play ''The Good Men Do'' (1917), which dramatises a meeting between the newly widowed Anne Hathaway and Anne Whateley. Hathaway is depicted as viciously shrewish and spiteful, in contrast to her noble-minded former rival. Both women portray Shakespeare's life as an actor and playwright as morally degrading, Whateley insisting that he would have been saved from this shameful profession had he married her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianshakespeares.ca/anthology/good_men_do.pdf ''The Good Men Do''.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivor Brown]] also published a play, ''William's Other Anne'' (1947) in which Shakespeare returns from London to meet Anne Whateley eight years after their broken engagement, just as Anne is about to marry a priggish schoolmaster. Shakespeare and Anne are reconciled, and Shakespeare saves his father from bankruptcy at the hands of Anne's vengeful mother.&lt;ref&gt;''Drama: the quarterly theatre review'', Issues 1-15, British Theatre Association, 1946, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was broadcast on BBC television in 1953 starring [[Irene Worth]] as Anne and [[John Gregson]] as Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/53/179.full.pdf Thespis, Plays, Films, Television, ''English'', Summer 1953; 9: 179 - 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whateley is mentioned in ''Late Mister Shakespeare'' (1998) by [[Robert Nye]], a novel in which an elderly actor who knew Shakespeare in his youth reconstructs the poet's life. He speculates about whether or not she actually existed. She also appears in Graeme Johnstone's novel ''The Playmakers'' (2005), in which she is portrayed as an innocent girl with a "sweet nature", "perfect figure, perfect teeth...perfectly shaped nose, clear blue eyes and creamy skin".&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Johnstone's novel ''The Playmakers'', 2005, BeWrite Books, 2005, pp.21-23.&lt;/ref&gt; She is devastated by the discovery that her beloved William has made Hathaway pregnant. She and William are soulmates who plan to work together to improve William's father's leather-making business. Anne hangs herself with a leather rope after the manipulative Hathaway forces Shakespeare to abandon her. The image of his lost love haunts Shakespeare throughout his life. He leaves for London to become a front man for [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s playwriting. He eventually finds a new love who is the mirror image of Whateley.

Laurie Lawlor's novel ''The Two Loves of Will Shakespeare'' (2006) depicts a teenage Shakespeare who seduces willing girls with his wit and charm. He is asked by his friend [[Richard Field (printer)|Richard Field]] to help him woo the beautiful and devout Anne Whateley, but falls in love with her himself. He tries to reform his ways to become worthy of her, but cannot resist his sexual urges, getting Hathaway pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Lawlor, ''The Two Loves of Will Shakespeare'', Holiday House, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Karen Harper]]'s novel ''Mistress Shakespeare'' (2008) Anne Whateley is the central character. She is once more portrayed as Shakespeare's true love. She narrates the story of her life as the dusky-skinned daughter of a Stratford businessman and an Italian acrobat. She and Shakespeare are married in a "[[History of marriage in Great Britain and Ireland|handfast]]" ceremony which is known only to them. In London she carries on a secret parallel marriage with him while Hathaway and her children stay in Stratford. She inspires many of his works and shares his feelings, triumphs and fears.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karenharperauthor.com/mistress_shakespeare.html Karen Harper's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1116">[[Image:Apollo Barberini Glyptothek Munich 211.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The “Apollo Barberini”]]
The '''Apollo Barberini''' is a 1st–2nd-century Roman sculpture of [[Apollo Citharoedus]].  It is a probable copy of the sculpture of [[Apollo Citharoedus]] (possibly by [[Scopas]] and perhaps from the sanctuary of Apollo at [[Rhamnus (Greek archaeological site)|Rhamnus]], in Attica) that was the cult statue in the [[temple of Apollo Palatinus]] in [[Rome]].  

It is named after the [[Barberini]] who acquired it.  It is now held in the [[Glyptothek|Munich Glyptothek]] (Inv. 211).

{{Arab culture}}
'''Arab culture''' is the culture of the [[Arabs]], from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the west to the [[Arabian Sea]] in the east, and from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. [[Language]], [[literature]], [[gastronomy]], [[art]], [[architecture]], [[music]], [[spirituality]], [[philosophy]], [[mysticism]] (etc.) are all part of the cultural heritage of the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40043536|title=Beauty in Arabic culture|last=Doris.|first=Behrens-Abouseif,|date=1999-01-01|publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers|isbn=1558761993|oclc=40043536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab world is sometimes divided into separate regions including [[Greater Maghreb|Al-Maghrib Al-Arabi]] (consisting of Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania), [[Fertile Crescent]] (consisting of Iraq, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and Jordan) and the [[Arabian Peninsula]] (consisting of south Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Al Ahwaz Al Arabiya,  Oman and the UAE) and the Arabian Peninsula's Al-Janoub Al-Arabi (consisting of Yemen and Oman).

==Literature==
{{main article|Arabic literature}}
[[Arabic literature]] is the writing produced, both [[prose]] and [[poetry]], by speakers of the [[Arabic language]]. It does not include works written using the [[Arabic alphabet]] but not in the Arabic language such as [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Urdu literature]]. The Arabic word used for literature is ''[[Adab (literature)|adab]]'' which is derived from a word meaning "to invite someone for a meal" and implies politeness, culture and enrichment. Arabic literature emerged in the 6th century, with only fragments of the written language appearing before then. The [[Qur'an]], from the 7th century, had the greatest and longest-lasting effect on Arabic culture and literature. [[Al-Khansa]], a female contemporary of Muhammad, was an acclaimed Arab poet.

===Mu'allaqat===
{{Main article| Muallaqat}}
The [[Mu'allaqat]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: المعلقات, {{IPA-ar|al-muʕallaqaːt|}}) is the name given to a series of seven Arabic poems or [[qasida]] that originated before the time of Islam. Each poem in the set has a different author, and is considered to be their best work. Mu'allaqat means "The Suspended Odes" or "The Hanging Poems," and comes from the poems being hung on the wall in the Kaaba at Mecca.

The seven authors, who span a period of around 100 years, are [[Imru' al-Qais]], [[Tarafa]], [[Zuhayr bin Abi Sulma|Zuhayr]], [[Labīd]], [['Antara Ibn Shaddad]], [['Amr ibn Kulthum]], and [[Harith ibn Hilliza]]. All of the Mu’allaqats contain stories from the authors’ lives and tribe politics. This is because poetry was used in pre-Islamic time to advertise the strength of a tribe’s king, wealth and people.

The ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' ({{lang-ar|أَلْف لَيْلَة وَلَيْلَة}} ''ʾAlf layla wa-layla''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Arabian Nights|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_ei3_COM_0021|edition=3rd|quote=Arabian Nights, the work known in Arabic as ''Alf layla wa-layla''|author=Marzolph, Ulrich|editors=Kate Fleet, Gudrun Krämer, Denis Matringe, John Nawas, Everett Rowson|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;), is a medieval folk tale collection which tells the story of Scheherazade, a Sassanid queen who must relate a series of stories to her malevolent husband, King Shahryar (Šahryār), to delay her execution. The stories are told over a period of one thousand and one nights, and every night she ends the story with a suspenseful situation, forcing the King to keep her alive for another day. The individual stories were created over several centuries, by many people from a number of different lands.

During the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid in the 8th century, Baghdad had become an important cosmopolitan city. Merchants from Persia, China, India, Africa, and Europe were all found in Baghdad. During this time, many of the stories that were originally folk stories are thought to have been collected orally over many years and later compiled into a single book. The compiler and ninth-century translator into Arabic is reputedly the storyteller Abu Abd-Allah Muhammad el-Gahshigar. The frame story of Shahrzad seems to have been added in the 14th century.

==Music==
[[File:Arabischer Maler um 730 002.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fresco]] from [[Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbî]], [[Syria]], [[Ummayad]] [[caliphs]] Palace, built in the early 7th century]]
[[Arabic music]] is the [[music]] of [[Arabs|Arab people]], especially those centered around the Arabian Peninsula. The world of Arab music has long been dominated by [[Cairo]], a cultural center, though musical innovation and regional styles abound from [[Tunisia]] to [[Saudi Arabia]]. [[Beirut]] has, in recent years, also become a major center of Arabic music. [[Classical Arab music]] is extremely popular across the population, especially a small number of superstars known throughout the Arab world. Regional styles of [[popular music]] include Iraqian el Maqaam, [[Algeria]]n ''[[raï]]'', [[Kuwait]]i ''[[sawt (music)|sawt]]'' and [[Egypt]]ian ''[[el gil]]''.

"The common style that developed is usually called 'Islamic' or 'Arab', though in fact it transcends religious, ethnic, geographical, and linguistic boundaries" and it is suggested that it be called the [[Near East]] (from Morocco to India) style ([[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|van der Merwe, Peter]] 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;9).

[[Habib Hassan Touma]] (1996, p.xix-xx) lists "five components" which "characterize the music of the Arabs:
# The [[Arab tone system]] (a [[musical tuning]] system) with specific interval structures, invented by [[al-Farabi]] in the 10th century (p.&amp;nbsp;170).
# [[Rhythmic-temporal structures]] that produce a rich variety of [[rhythm]]ic patterns, ''[[Rhythm in Arabian music|awzan]]'', used to accompany the metered vocal and instrumental genres and give them form.
# [[Musical instrument]]s that are found throughout the Arabian world and that represent a standardized [[tone system]], are played with standardized performance techniques, and exhibit similar details in construction and design.
# Specific social contexts for the making of music, whereby [[Music genre|musical genres]] can be classified as urban (music of the city inhabitants), rural (music of the country inhabitants), or [[Bedouin]] (music of the desert inhabitants).
# A musical mentality that is responsible for the aesthetic homogeneity of the tonal-spatial and rhythmic-temporal structures in Arabian music, whether [[musical composition|composed]] or [[improvise]]d, [[instrumental]] or [[vocal]], [[secular]] or [[sacred]]. The Arab's musical mentality is defined by:
## The maqām phenomenon.
## The predominance of vocal music.
## The predilection for small instrumental ensembles.
## The mosaiclike stringing together of musical form elements, that is, the arrangement in a sequence of small and smallest melodic elements, and their repetition, combination, and permutation within the framework of the tonal-spatial model.
## The absence of polyphony, polyrhythm, and motivic development. Arabian music is, however, very familiar with the ostinato, as well as with a more instinctive heterophonic way of making music.
## The alternation between a free rhythmic-temporal and fixed tonal-spatial organization on the one hand and a fixed rhythmic-temporal and free tonal-spatial structure on the other. This alternation... results in exciting contrasts."

Much Arab music is characterized by an emphasis on [[melody]] and [[rhythm]] rather than [[harmony]]. Thus much Arabic music is [[homophony|homophonic]] in nature. Some genres of Arab music are [[polyphonic]]—as the instrument [[Kanun (instrument)|Kanoun]] is based upon the idea of playing two-note [[chord (music)|chords]]—but quintessentially, Arabic music is melodic.

It would be incorrect though to call it [[Musical mode|modal]], for the Arabic system is more complex than that of the [[Greece|Greek]] modes. The basis of the Arabic music is the [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] (pl. maqamat), which looks like the mode, but is not quite the same. The maqam has a "[[tonality|tonal]]" note on which the piece must end (unless modulation occurs).

[[File:Riqq.jpg|thumb|left|The [[riq]] is widely used in Arabic music]]

The maqam consists of at least two jins, or scale segments. "Jins" in Arabic comes from the ancient Greek word "genus," meaning type. In practice, a jins (pl. ajnas) is either a [[trichord]], a [[tetrachord]], or a [[pentachord]]. The trichord is three notes, the tetrachord four, and the pentachord five. The maqam usually covers only one [[octave]] (two jins), but sometimes it covers more than one octave. Like the [[Minor scale|melodic minor]] scale and Indian ragas, some maqamat have different ajnas, and thus notes, while descending or ascending. Because of the continuous innovation of jins and because most music scholars don't agree on the existing number anyway, it's hard to give an accurate number of the jins. Nonetheless, in practice most musicians would agree on the 8 most frequently used ajnas: Rast, Bayat, Sikah, Hijaz, Saba, Kurd, Nahawand, and Ajam — and a few of the most commonly used variants of those: Nakriz, Athar Kurd, Sikah Beladi, Saba Zamzama. Mukhalif is a rare jins used exclusively in Iraq, and it does not occur in combination with other ajnas.

The main difference between the western [[chromatic scale]] and the Arabic scales is the existence of many in-between notes, which are sometimes referred to as [[quarter tone]]s for the sake of practicality. However, while in some treatments of theory the quarter tone scale or all twenty four tones should exist, according to [[Yusuf Shawqi|Yūsuf Shawqī]] (1969) in practice there are many fewer tones (Touma 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;170).

In fact, the situation is much more complicated than that. In 1932, at International Convention on Arabic music held in Cairo, Egypt (attended by such Western luminaries as [[Béla Bartók]] and [[Henry George Farmer]]), experiments were done which determined conclusively that the notes in actual use differ substantially from an even-tempered 24-tone scale, and furthermore that the intonation of many of those notes differ slightly from region to region (Egypt, Turkey, Syria, Iraq). The commission's recommendation is as follows: "The tempered scale and the natural scale should be rejected. In Egypt, the Egyptian scale is to be kept with the values, which were measured with all possible precision. The Turkish, Syrian, and Iraqi scales should remain what they are..." (translated in Maalouf 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;220). Both in modern practice, and based on the evidence from recorded music over the course of the last century, there are several differently tuned "E"s in between the E-flat and E-natural of the Western Chromatic scale, depending on the maqam or jins in use, and depending on the region.

Musicians and teachers refer to these in-between notes as "quarter-tones" ("half-flat" or "half-sharp") for ease of nomenclature, but perform and teach the exact values of intonation in each jins or maqam by ear. It should also be added, in reference to Touma's comment above, that these "quarter-tones" are not used everywhere in the maqamat: in practice, Arabic music does not modulate to 12 different tonic areas like the [[Well-Tempered Klavier]], and so the most commonly used "quarter tones" are on E (between E-flat and E-natural), A, B, D, F (between F-natural and F-sharp) and C.

The prototypical Arab ensemble in Egypt and Syria is known as the [[Takht (music)|takht]], which includes, (or included at different time periods) instruments such as the [['oud]], [[qanun (instrument)|qanún]], [[rabab]], nay, [[violin]] (which was introduced in the 1840s or 50s), [[riq]] and [[goblet drum|dumbek]]. In Iraq, the traditional ensemble, known as the chalghi, includes only two melodic instruments—the jowza (similar to the rabab but with four strings) and [[Santoor (Persian instrument)|santur]]—with [[riq]] and [[dumbek]].

Prior to the Islamic Era, [[poetry]] was regarded as the main means of communication on the [[Arabian Peninsula]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} It related the achievements of tribes and defeats of enemies and also served as a tool for [[propaganda]]. After the arrival of [[Islam]] other forms of communication replaced poetry as the primary form of communication. [[Imams]] (preachers) played a role in disseminating information and relating news from the authorities to the people. The suq or marketplace gossip and interpersonal relationships played an important role in the spreading of news, and this form of communication among [[Arabs]] continues today. Before the introduction of the [[printing press]] [[Muslims]] obtained most of their news from the imams at the [[mosque]], friends or in the marketplace. [[Colonial powers]] and [[Christian Missionaries]] in [[Lebanon]] were responsible for the introduction of the printing press. It was not until the 19th century that the first newspapers began to appear, mainly in [[Egypt]] and [[Lebanon]], which had the most newspapers per capita.

During [[France|French]] rule in [[Egypt]] in the time of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] the first newspaper was published, in French. There is debate over when the first Arabic language newspaper was published; according to Arab scholar Abu Bakr, it was ''Al Tanbeeh'' (1800), published in Egypt, or it was ''Junral Al Iraq'' (1816), published in [[Iraq]], according to other researchers. In the mid-19th century the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish Empire]] dominated the first newspapers. In the [[Northern Africa]]n countries of [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]] the French colonial power built a press link between mainland countries.

The first newspapers were limited to official content and included accounts of relations with other countries and civil trials. In the following decades Arab media blossomed due to [[journalist]]s mainly from Syria and Lebanon, who were intellectuals and published their newspapers without the intention of making a profit. Because of the restrictions by most governments, these intellectuals were forced to flee their respective countries but had gained a following and because of their popularity in this field of work other intellectuals began to take interest in the field.
The first émigré Arab newspaper, ''Mar’at al Ahwal'', was published in Turkey in 1855 by Rizqallah Hassoun Al Halabi. It was criticized by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and shut down after only one year. Intellectuals in the [[Arab world]] soon realized the power of the press. Some countries' newspapers were government-run and had political agendas in mind. Independent newspapers began to spring up which expressed opinions and were a place for the public to out their views on the state. Illiteracy rates in the Arab world played a role in the formation of media, and due to the low reader rates newspapers were forced to get political parties to subsidize their publications, giving them input to editorial policy.

Freedoms that have branched through the introduction of the Internet in [[Middle East]] are creating a stir politically, culturally, and socially. There is an increasing divide between the generations. The Arab world is in conflict internally. The internet has brought economic prosperity and development, but [[blog]]gers have been incarcerated all around in the Middle East for their opinions and views on their regimes, the same consequence which was once given to those who publicly expressed themselves without anonymity. But the power of the internet has provided also a public shield for these bloggers since they have the ability to engage public sympathy on such a large scale. This is creating a dilemma that shakes the foundation of Arab culture, government, religious interpretation, economic prosperity, and personal integrity.

Each country or region in the Arab world has varying colloquial languages which are used for everyday speech, yet its presence in the media world is discouraged. Prior to the establishment of [[Modern Standard Arabic]] (MSA), during the 19th century, the language of the media was stylized and resembled literary language of the time, proving to be ineffective in relaying information. Currently MSA is used by Arab media, including newspapers, books and some television stations, in addition to all formal writing. Vernaculars are however present in certain forms of media including satires, dramas, music videos and other local programs.

=== Media values ===

Journalism ethics is a system of values that determines what constitutes "good" and "bad" journalism.&lt;ref name="Power and Weakness"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hafez|first=Kai|title=Arab Media: Power and Weakness|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|pages=147–64|authorlink=The Unknown Desire for "Objectivity": Journalism Ethics in Arab (and Western) Journalism|editor=Kai Hafez}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A system of media values consists of and is constructed by journalists'  and other actors'  decisions about issues like what is "newsworthy," how to frame the news, and whether to observe topical "red lines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Itule|first=Bruce|title=News Writing and Reporting for Today's Media|date=2007|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|author2=Douglas Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a system of values varies over space and time, and is embedded within the existing social, political, and economic structures in a society. William Rugh states, "There is an intimate, organic relationship between media institutions and society in the way that those institutions are organized and controlled. Neither the institution nor the society in which it functions can be understood properly without reference to the other. This is certainly true in the Arab world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rugh|first=William|title=Arab Mass Media: Newspapers, Radio, and Television in Arab Politics|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Media values in the Arab world therefore vary between and within countries. In the words of Lawrence Pintak and Jeremy Ginges, “The Arab media are not a monolith.”&lt;ref name="Mission"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pintak|first=Lawrence|author2=Jeremy Ginges|title=The Mission of Arab Journalism: Creating Change in a Time of Turmoil|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|date=2008|volume=13|issue=3|page=219|doi=10.1177/1940161208317142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists in the Arab world hold many of the same values with their news generation as do journalists in the [[Western world]]. Journalists in the Arab world often aspire to Western norms of objectivity, impartiality, and balance. Kuldip Roy Rampal's study of journalist training programs in North Africa leads him to the conclusion that, "the most compelling dilemma faced by professional journalists, increasingly graduates of journalism degree programs, in the four Maghreb states is how to reconcile their preference for press freedom and objectivity with constraints imposed by political and legal factors that point to a pro-government journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rampal|first=Kuldip Roy|title=Professionals in Search of Professionalism: Journalists' Dilemma in Four Maghreb States|journal=International Communication Gazette|date=1996|volume=58|issue=1|pages=25–43|doi=10.1177/001654929605800102}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Iyotika Ramaprasad and Naila Nabil Hamdy state, “A new trend toward objectivity and impartiality as a value in Arab journalism seems to be emerging, and the values of Arab and Western journalism in this field have started to converge.”&lt;ref name="Function"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramaprasad|first=Jyotika|author2=Naila Nabil Hamdy|title=Functions of Egyptian Journalists: Perceived Importance and Actual Importance|journal=International Communication Gazette|date=2006|volume=68|issue=2|pages=167–85|doi=10.1177/1748048506062233}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Further, many journalists in the Arab world express their desires for the media to become a fourth estate akin to the media in the West. In a survey of 601 journalists in the Arab world, 40% of them viewed investigation of the government as part of their job.&lt;ref name=Mission /&gt;

Important differences between journalists in the Arab world and their Western counterparts are also apparent.  Some journalists in the Arab world see no conflict between objectivity and support for political causes.&lt;ref name="Inside Arab Newsroom"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pintak|first=Lawrence|author2=Jeremy Ginges|title=Inside the Arab Newsroom|journal=Journalism Studies|date=2009|volume=10|issue=2|page=173|doi=10.1080/14616700802337800}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Ramprasad and Hamdy’s sample of 112 Egyptian journalists gave the highest importance to supporting [[Pan-Arabism|Arabism]] and Arab values, which included injunctions such as “defend Islamic societies, traditions and values” and “support the cause of the Palestinians.” Sustaining democracy through “examining government policies and decisions critically,” ranked a close second.&lt;ref name=Function /&gt;  This view is further endorsed in Kirat’s survey where 65 percent of Algerian journalists agreed that the task for the press is to "help achieve the goals and objectives of development plans.&lt;ref&gt;Kirat, Mohamed. "The Algerian News People: A Study of Their Backgrounds, Professional Orientations and Working Conditions". Diss. Indiana University, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such an approach to media fits within the larger scope of  [[development communication]] and journalism. The extent to which professional and political aims conflict is a subject of study for scholars of the Arab world's media.

Other journalists reject the notion of media ethics altogether because they see it as a mechanism of control. Kai Hafez states, “Many governments in the Arab world have tried to hijack the issue of media ethics and have used it as yet another controlling device, with the result that many Arab journalists, while they love to speak about the challenges of their profession, hate performing under the label of media ethics.”&lt;ref name="Power and Weakness" /&gt;

Historically, news in the Arab world was used to inform, guide, and publicize the actions of political practitioners rather than being just a consumer product. The power of news as political tool was discovered in the early 19th century, with the purchase of shares from Le Temps a French newspaper by Ismail the grandson of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]. Doing so allowed Ismail to publicize his policies.&lt;ref name=Ayalon&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayalon|first=Ami|title=The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History|date=1995|publisher=Oxford UP|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab Media coming to modernity flourished and with it its responsibilities to the political figures that have governed its role. Ami Ayalon argues in his history of the press in the Arab Middle East that, “Private journalism began as an enterprise with very modest objectives, seeking not to defy authority but rather to serve it, to collaborate and coexist cordially with it. The demand for freedom of expression, as well as for individual political freedom, a true challenge to the existing order, came only later, and hesitantly at that, and was met by a public response that can best be described as faint." &lt;ref name=Ayalon /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Media researchers stress that the moral and social responsibility of newspeople dictates that they should not agitate public opinion, but rather should keep the status quo. It is also important to preserve national unity by not stirring up ethnic or religious conflict.&lt;ref name="Mellor, Noha 2005"&gt;Mellor, Noha. The Making of Arab News. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The values of media in the Arab world have started to change with the emergence of “new media." Examples of new media include news websites, blogs, and satellite television stations like [[Al Arabiya]]. The founding of the Qatari [[Al Jazeera]] network in 1996 especially affected media values. Some scholars believe that the network has blurred the line between private- and state- run news. Mohamed Zayani and Sofiane Sabraoui state, “Al Jazeera is owned by the government, but has an independent editorial policy; it is publicly funded, but independent minded.”&lt;ref name="Culture of Al Jazeera"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zayani|first=Mohamed|title=The Culture of Al Jazeera: Inside an Arab Media Giant|date=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson, NC|author2=Sofiane Sahroui}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Al Jazeera media network espouses a clear mission and strategy, and was one of the first news organizations in the Arab world to release a code of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;"Code of Ethics." Al Jazeera English. Al Jazeera Media Network, 07 Nov. 2010. Web. 02 Mar. 2014. http://www.aljazeera.com/aboutus/2006/11/2008525185733692771.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its government ties, it seeks to “give no priority to commercial or political over professional consideration” and to “cooperate with Arab and international journalistic unions and associations to defend freedom of the press.” With a motto of “the view and the other view,” it purports to “present the diverse points of view and opinions without bias and partiality.” It has sought to fuse these ostensibly Western media norms with a wider “Arab orientation,” evocative of the social responsibility discussed by scholars such as Noha Mellor above.

Some more recent assessments of Al Jazeera have [[Al Jazeera controversies and criticism|criticized]] it for a lack of credibility in the wake of the Arab Spring. Criticism has come from within the Arab Middle East, including from state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunham|first=Jillian|title=Syrian TV Station Accuses Al Jazeera of Fabricating Uprising|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/syrian-tv-station-accuses-al-jazeera-of-fabricating-uprising/|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent commentators have criticized its neutrality vis-a-vis the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Peter|title=In Syria, al Jazeera’s Credibility Implodes|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/03/05/in-syria-al-jazeeras-credibility-implodes/|publisher=CounterPunch|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media values are not the only variable that affects news output in Arab society. Hafez states, “The interaction of political, economic, and social environments with individual and collective professional ethics is the driving force behind journalism.”&lt;ref name="Power and Weakness" /&gt; In most Arab countries, newspapers cannot be published without a government-issued license. Most Arab countries also have press laws, which impose boundaries on what can and cannot be said in print.

Censorship plays a significant role in journalism in the Arab world. Censorship comes in a variety of forms: [[Self-censorship]], Government [[Censorship]] (governments struggle to control through technological advances in ex. the internet), [[Ideology]]/Religious Censorship, and Tribal/Family/Alliances Censorship. Because [[Journalism]] in the Arab world comes with a range of dangers – journalists throughout the Arab world can be imprisoned, tortured, and even killed in their line of work – self-censorship is extremely important for many Arab journalists. A study conducted by the Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) in Jordan, for example, found that the majority of Jordanian journalists exercise self-censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hazaimeh |first=Hani |title=Majority of Jordanian Journalists Exercise Self-censorship - Survey |url=http://jordantimes.com/majority-of-jordanian-journalists-exercise-self-censorship----survey |publisher=The Jordan Times |accessdate=22 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708083856/http://jordantimes.com/majority-of-jordanian-journalists-exercise-self-censorship----survey |archivedate=8 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Committee to Protect Journalists|CPJ]] found that 34 journalists were killed in the region in 2012, 72 were imprisoned on December 1, 2012, and 126 were in exile from 2007 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attacks on the Press: Journalism on the Front Lines in 2012|url=http://cpj.org/2013/02/attacks-on-the-press-in-2012-mideast.php|publisher=Committee for the Protection of Journalists|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related point is that media owners and patrons have effects on the values of their outlets. Newspapers in the Arab world can be divided into three categories: government owned, [[partisan (military)|partisan]] owned, and independently owned. Newspaper, radio, and television patronization in the Arab world has heretofore been primarily a function of governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rugh|first=William|title=Arab Mass Media: Newspapers, Radio, and Television in Arab Politics|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;   "Now, newspaper ownership has been consolidated in the hands of powerful chains and groups. Yet, [[profit (economics)|profit]] is not the driving force behind the launching of newspapers; [[publishers]] may establish a newspaper to ensure a platform for their political opinions, although it is claimed that this doesn’t necessarily influence the news content".&lt;ref&gt;Pintak, Lawrence. "Arab Media: Not Quite Utopia"&lt;/ref&gt; In the Arab world, as far as content is concerned, news is politics. Arab states are intimately involved in the economic well-being of many Arab news organizations so they apply pressure in several ways, most notably through ownership or advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin |first=Justin D. |url=http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/article/102479/Investigative-Journalism-in-the-Arab-World.aspx |title=Nieman Reports &amp;#124; Investigative Journalism in the Arab World |publisher=Nieman.harvard.edu |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts hold that cultural and societal pressures determine journalists' news output in the Arab world. For example, to the extent that family reputation and personal reputation are fundamental principles in Arab civilization, exposes of corruption, examples of weak moral fiber in governors and policy makers, and [[investigative journalism]] may have massive consequences. In fact, some journalists and media trainers in the Arab world nevertheless actively promote the centrality of investigative journalism to the media’s larger [[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]] function. In Jordan, for example, where the degree of government and security service interference in the media is high, non-governmental organizations such as the Center for Defending the Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) and Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ) train journalists to undertake investigative journalism projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pies|first=Judith|title=Arab Media: Power and Weakness|date=2008|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|pages=165–81|chapter=Agents of Change? Journalism Ethics in Lebanese and Jordanian Journalism Education.|editor=Kai Hafez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jordan Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists sign.JPG|thumb|The Jordanian Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists (CDFJ) posted this sign in protest of the country's 2012 Press and Publications law. It reads, "The right to obtain information is a right for all people".]]

Some Saudi journalists stress the importance of enhancing Islam through the media. The developmental role of media was acknowledged by an overwhelming majority of Saudi journalists, while giving the readers what they want was not regarded as a priority.&lt;ref&gt;Tash, Abdulkader. A Profile of Professional Journalists Working in the Saudi Arabian Daily Press. Diss. Southern Illinois University, 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, journalism codes, as an important source for the study of media values, complicate this notion. Kai Hafez states, “The possible hypothesis that Islamic countries might not be interested in ‘truth’ and would rather propagate ‘Islam’ as the single truth cannot be verified completely because even a code that limits journalists’ freedom of expression to Islamic objectives and values, the Saudi Arabian code, demands that journalists present real facts.”&lt;ref name="Power and Weakness" /&gt; In addition, [[Media of Saudi Arabia|Saudi journalists]] operate in an environment in which anti-religious talk is likely to be met with censorship.

Patterns of consumption also affect media values. People in the Arab world rely on newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and the Internet to differing degrees and to meet a variety of ends. For Rugh, the proportion of radio and television receivers to Arab populations relative to UNESCO minimum standards suggests that radio and television are the most widely consumed media. He estimates that television reaches well over 100 million people in the region, and this number has likely grown since 2004. By contrast, he supposes that Arab newspapers are designed more for elite-consumption on the basis of their low circulation. He states, "Only five Arab countries have daily newspapers which distribute over 60,000 copies and some have dailies only in the under-10,000 range. Only Egypt has dailies which distribute more than a half million copies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rugh|first=William|title=Arab Mass Media: Newspapers, Radio, and Television in Arab Politics|date=2004|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, CT|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimating newspaper readership is complicated, however, by the fact that single newspapers can change hands many times in a day. Finally, the internet continues to be a fairly common denominator in Arab societies. A report by the Dubai School of Government and Bayt.com estimates that there are more than 125 million Internet users in the region, and that more than 53 million of them actively use social media. They caution, however, that while "the internet has wide-ranging benefits, these benefits do not reach large segments of societies in the Arab region. The digital divide remains a significant barrier for many people. In many parts of the Arab world levels of educational attainment, economic activity, standards of living and internet costs still determine a person's access to life-changing technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arab World Online: Trends in Internet Usage in the Arab Region|url=http://img.b8cdn.com/images/uploads/article_docs/dsg-gip_bayt_report_final_16822_EN.pdf|publisher=The Dubai School of Government with Bayt.com|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, according to Leo Gher and Hussein Amin, the Internet and other modern telecommunication services may serve to counter the effects of private and public ownership and patronage of the press. They state, "Modern international telecommunications services now assist in the free flow of information, and neither inter-Arab conflicts nor differences among groups will affect the direct exchange of services provided by global cyberspace networks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gher|first=Leo A.|author2=Hussein Y. Amin|title=New and Old Media Access and Ownership in the Arab World|journal=International Communications Gazette|date=1999|volume=61|series=1|pages=59–88|doi=10.1177/0016549299061001004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magazines ===
In most Arab countries, [[magazines]] cannot be published without a government-issued license. Magazines in the Arab world, like many of the magazines in the Western world, are geared towards women. However, the number of magazines in the Arab world is significantly smaller than that of the Western world. The Arab world is not as advertisement driven as the Western world. Advertisers fuel the funding for most Western magazines to exist. Thus, a lesser emphasis on [[advertisement]] in the Arab world plays into the low number of magazines.

=== Radio ===
There are 90 private radio stations throughout [[the Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. ([http://www.newarabia.net/arabic_radio_stations.php list of private radio stations in the Arab world])

Arab radio broadcasting began in the 1920s, but only a few Arab countries had their own broadcasting stations before [[World War II]]. After 1945, most Arab states began to create their own radio broadcasting systems, although it was not until 1970, when [[Oman]] opened its radio transmissions, that every one of them had its own radio station.

Among Arab countries, [[Egypt]] has been a leader in radio broadcasting from the beginning. Broadcasting began in Egypt in the 1920s with private commercial radio. In 1947, however, the Egyptian government declared radio a government monopoly and began investing in its expansion.

By the 1970s, Egyptian radio had fourteen different broadcast services with a total air time of 1,200 hours per week. Egypt is ranked third in the world among radio broadcasters. The programs were all government controlled, and much of the motivation for the government's investment in radio was due to the aspirations of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] to be the recognized leader of the Arab world.

Egypt's "Voice of the Arabs" station, which targeted other Arab countries with a constant stream of news and political features and commentaries, became the most widely heard station in the region. Only after the [[June 1967 war]], when it was revealed that this station had misinformed the public about what was happening, did it lose some credibility; nevertheless it retained a large listenership.

On the [[Arabian Peninsula]], radio was slower to develop. In [[Saudi Arabia]], radio broadcasts started in the [[Jidda]]-[[Mecca]] area in 1948, but they did not start in the central or eastern provinces until the 1960s. Neighboring [[Bahrain]] had radio by 1955, but [[Qatar]], [[Abu Dhabi]], and [[Oman]] did not start indigenous radio broadcasting until nearly a quarter century later.

===Television===
Almost all television channels in the Arab world were [[government]]-owned and strictly controlled prior to the 1990s. In the 1990s the spread of satellite television began changing television in Arab countries. Often noted as a pioneer, [[al-Jazeera]] represents a shift towards a more professional approach to news and current affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-bab.com/media/television.htm |title=Arab media: television |publisher=Al-bab.com |accessdate=2011-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505045604/http://www.al-bab.com/media/television.htm |archivedate=2011-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Financed by the [[Qatar]] government and established in 1996, [[al-Jazeera]] was the first Arabic channel to deliver extensive live news coverage, going so far as to send reporters to "unthinkable" places like Israel. Breaking the mold in more ways than one, al-Jazeera’s discussion programs raised subjects that had long been prohibited. However, in 2008, [[Egypt]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] called for a meeting to approve a charter to regulate [[satellite]] [[broadcasting]]. The [[Arab League]] Satellite Broadcasting Charter (2008) lays out principles for regulating satellite broadcasting in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;Arab Media &amp; Society (March, 2008):[http://www.arabmediasociety.com/articles/downloads/20080314081327_AMS_Charter_English.pdf Arab Satellite Broadcasting Charter (Unofficial Translation)] Retrieved 6 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arab Media &amp; Society (March, 2008): [http://www.arabmediasociety.com/UserFiles/AMS%20Charter%20Arabic.pdf Arab Satellite Broadcasting Charter (in Arabic)] Retrieved 6 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Other satellite channels:

* [[Al-Arabiya]]: established in 2003; based in Dubai; offshoot of MBC
* [[Al-Hurra]] ("The Free One"): established in 2004 by the United States; counter perceives "biases" in Arab news media
* Al-Manar: owned by Hizbullah; Lebanese-based; highly controversial

"Across the [[Middle East]], new [[television stations]], [[radio stations]] and [[websites]] are sprouting like incongruous electronic mushrooms in what was once a media desert. Meanwhile [[newspapers]] are aggressively probing the red lines that have long contained them".&lt;ref name="Pintak, Lawrence 2007"&gt;Pintak, Lawrence. Reporting a Revolution: the Changing Arab Media Landscape. Arab Media &amp; Society (February, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Technology]] is playing a significant role in the changing Arab media. Pintak furthers, "Now, there are 263 free-to-air (FTA) satellite television stations in the region, according to Arab Advisors Group. That’s double the figure as of just two years ago".&lt;ref name="Pintak, Lawrence 2007"/&gt; [[Freedom of speech]] and money have little to do with why [[satellite television]] is sprouting up everywhere. Instead, "A desire for political influence is probably the biggest factor driving channel growth. But ego is a close second".&lt;ref name="Pintak, Lawrence 2007"/&gt; The influence of the West is very apparent in Arab media, especially in television. [[Arab soap operas]] and the emerging popularity of [[reality TV]] are evidence of this notion.

"In the wake of controversy triggered by ''Super Star'' and ''Star Academy'', some observers have hailed reality television as a harbinger of democracy in the Arab world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kraidy |first=Marwan |url=http://www.arabmediasociety.com/topics/index.php?t_article=85 |title=Arab Media &amp; Society |publisher=Arabmediasociety.com |accessdate=2011-04-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110405121157/http://www.arabmediasociety.com/topics/index.php?t_article=85| archivedate= 5 April 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Star Academy]]'' in [[Lebanon]] is strikingly similar to ''[[American Idol]]'' mixed with ''[[The Real World]]''. ''Star Academy'' began in 2003 in the Arab world. "Reality television entered Arab public discourse in the last five years at a time of significant turmoil in the region: escalating violence in [[Iraq]], contested elections in Egypt, the struggle for women’s political rights in [[Kuwait]], [[political assassination]]s in [[Lebanon]], and the protracted [[Arab-Israeli Conflict]]. This geo-political crisis environment that currently frames Arab politics and Arab-Western relations is the backdrop to the controversy surrounding the social and political impact of Arab reality television, which assumes religious, cultural or moral manifestations."&lt;ref&gt;Kraidy, Marwan M. Reality Television and Politics in the Arab World: Preliminary Observations. Transnational Broadcasting Studies, 15 (Fall/ Winter, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cinema ===
{{main article|Arab cinema}}
Most Arab countries did not produce films before nation independence. In [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]], production is even now confined to short films or television. [[Bahrain]] witnessed the production of its first and only full-length feature film in 1989. In [[Jordan]] national production has barely exceeded half a dozen feature films. [[Algeria]] and [[Iraq]] have produced approximately 100 films each, [[Morocco]] around seventy, [[Tunisia]] around 130, and [[Syria]] some 150. [[Lebanon]], owing to an increased production during the 1950s and 1960s, has made some 180 feature films. Only [[Egypt]] has far exceeded these countries, with a production of more than 2,500 feature films (all meant for cinema, not television).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Shafik, Viola. Arab Cinema: History and Cultural Identity.&lt;/ref&gt; As with most aspects of [[Arab media]], censorship plays a large art of creating and distributing films. "In most Arab countries, film projects must first pass a state committee, which grants or denies permission to shoot. Once this permission is obtained, another official license, a so-called visa, is necessary in order to exploit the film commercially. This is normally approved by a committee of the Ministry of Information or a special censorship authority".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The most significant taboo topics under state supervision are consistent with those of other forms of media: [[religion]], [[sex]], and [[politics]].

=== Internet ===
The [[Internet]] in the Arab world is powerful source of expression and information as it is in other places in the world. While some believe that it is the harbinger of freedom in media to the [[Middle East]], others think that it is a new medium for [[censorship]]. Both are true. The Internet has created a new arena for discussion and the dissemination of information for the Arab world just as it has in the rest of the world. The youth in particular are accessing and utilizing the tools. People are encouraged and enabled to join in political discussion and critique in a manner that was not previously possible. Those same people are also discouraged and blocked from those debates as the differing regimes try to restrict access based on religious and state objections to certain material.

The internet in the Arab world has a snowball effect; now that the snowball is rolling, it can no longer be stopped. Getting bigger and stronger, it is bound to crush down all obstacles. In addition, to the stress caused by the Arab bloggers, a new forum was opened for Arab activists; Facebook. Arab activists have been using Facebook in the utmost creative way to support the democracy movement in the region, a region that has one of the highest rates of repression in the world. Unlike other regions where oppressive countries (like China, Iran and Burma) represent the exception, oppression can be found everywhere in the Arab world. The number of Arab internet users interested in political affairs does not exceed a few thousands, mainly represented by internet activists and bloggers, out of 58 million internet users in the Arab world. As few as they are, they have succeeded in shedding some light on the corruption and repression of the Arab governments and dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;How the Internet has snowballed in the Arab world. &lt;http://www.ikhwanweb.com/print.php?id=22470&gt; {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929043556/http://www.ikhwanweb.com/print.php?id=22470 |date=September 29, 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Public Internet use began in the US in the 1980s. Internet access began in the early 1990s in the Arab world, with [[Tunisia]] being first in 1991 according to Dr. Deborah L. Wheeler. The years of the Internet's introduction in the various Arab countries are reported differently. Wheeler reports that [[Kuwait]] joined in 1992, and in 1993, [[Turkey]], [[Iraq]] and the [[UAE]] came online. In 1994 [[Jordan]] joined the Internet, and [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Syria]] followed in the late 1990s. Financial considerations and the lack of widespread availability of services are factors in the slower growth in the Arab world, but taking into consideration the popularity of [[internet cafe]]s, the numbers [[online]] are much larger than the subscription numbers would reveal.&lt;ref&gt;Hofheinz, Albrecht. "The Internet in the Arab World: Playground for Political Liberalization." (n.d.): 96&lt;/ref&gt;

The people most commonly utilizing the Internet in the Arab world are youths. The [[café]] users in particular tend to be under 30, single and have a variety of levels of [[education]] and language proficiency. Despite reports that use of the internet was curtailed by lack of [[English language|English]] skills, Dr. Wheeler found that people were able to search with [[Arabic]]. Searching for jobs, the unemployed frequently fill cafes in [[Egypt]] and [[Jordan]]. They are [[men]] and [[women]] equally. Most of them chat and they have email. In a survey conducted by Dr. Deborah Wheeler, she found them to almost all to have been taught to use the Internet by a friend or family member. They all felt their lives to have been significantly changed by the use of the Internet. The use of the Internet in the Arab world is very political in the nature of the posts and of the sites read and visited. The Internet has brought a medium to Arabs that allows for a [[free will|freedom]] of expression not allowed or accepted before. For those who can get online, there are blogs to read and write and access to worldwide outlets of information once unobtainable. With this access, regimes have attempted to curtail what people are able to read, but the Internet is a medium not as easily manipulated as telling a [[newspaper]] what it can or cannot [[publish]]. The Internet can be reached via [[proxy server]], mirror, and other means. Those who are thwarted with one method will find 12 more methods around the blocked site. As [[journalists]] suffer and are imprisoned in traditional media, the Internet is no different with [[bloggers]] regularly being imprisoned for expressing their views for the world to read. The difference is that there is a worldwide audience witnessing this crackdown and watching as [[laws]] are created and recreated to attempt to control the vastness of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Rinnawi, Khalil. "The Internet and the Arab world as a virtual public shpere." (n.d.): 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jihadists]] are using the Internet to reach a greater audience. Just as a simple citizen can now have a worldwide voice, so can a movement. Groups are using the Internet to share video, photos, programs and any kind of information imaginable. Standard media may not report what the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] would say on their site. However, for the interested, the Internet is a tool that is utilized with great skill by those who wish to be heard. A file uploaded to 100 sites and placed in multiple forums will reach millions instantly. Information on the Internet can be thwarted, slowed, even redirected, but it cannot be stopped if someone wants it out there on the Internet.

The efforts by the various regimes to control the information are all falling apart gradually. Those fighting crime online have devised methods of tracking and catching criminals. Unfortunately those same tools are being used to arrest bloggers and those who would just wish to be heard. The Internet is a vast and seemingly endless source of information. Arabs are using it more than perhaps the world is aware and it is changing the media.

==Society==
[[File:Cairo Cafe.JPG|thumb|right|A café in [[Cairo]]]]
Social loyalty is of great importance in Arab culture. Family is one of the most important aspects of the Arab society. While self-reliance, individuality, and responsibility are taught by Arabic parents to their children, family loyalty is the greatest lesson taught in Arab families.  "Unlike the extreme individualism we see in North America (every person for him or herself, individual rights, families living on their own away from relatives, and so on), Arab society emphasizes the importance of the group. Arab culture teaches that the needs of the group are more important than the needs of one person."&lt;ref&gt;J. Esherick, Women in the Arab World (Philadelphia: Mason Crest Publishers, 2006), 68&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bedouin tribes of Saudi Arabia, "intense feelings of loyalty and dependence are fostered and preserved"&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Gannon, Understanding Global Culture: Metaphorical Journeys Through 28 Nations, 3rd Edition, (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2004), 70&lt;/ref&gt; by the family.&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Samovar, et al., Communication Between Cultures, 7th Ed., (Boston: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 2010), 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Margaret Nydell, in her book ''Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Modern Times'', writes "family loyalty and obligations take precedence over loyalty to friends or demands of a job."&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"&gt;M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Modern Times, 4th Ed., (Boston: Intercultural Press, 2006), 71&lt;/ref&gt;  She goes on to state that "members of a family are expected to support each other in disputes with outsiders. Regardless of personal antipathy among relatives, they must defend each other’s honor, counter criticism, and display group cohesion..."&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt;  Of all members of the family, however, the most revered member is the mother.

Family honor is one of the most important characteristics in the Arab family. According to Margaret Nydell, social exchanges between men and women happen very seldom outside of the work place.&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt; Men and women refrain from being alone together. They have to be very careful in social situations because those interactions can be interpreted negatively and cause gossip, which can tarnish the reputation of women. Women are able to socialize freely with other women and male family members, but have to have family members present to socialize with men that are not part of the family.&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt; These conservative practices are put into place to protect the reputation of women. Bad behavior not only affects women but her family’s honor. Practices differ between countries and families. Saudi Arabia has stricter practices when it comes to men and women and will even require marriage documents if a woman and man are seen together alone.&lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt;

'''Arab values'''
One of the characteristics of Arabs is generosity and they usually show it by being courteous with each other. Some of the most important values for Arabs are honor and loyalty. Margaret Nydell, in her book ''Understanding Arabs: A Guide for Modern Times' &lt;ref name="M. Nydell, Understanding Arabs 2006"/&gt;  '' says that Arabs can be defined as, humanitarian, loyal and polite. Tarek Mahfouz explains in the book "Arab Culture" &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mahfouz, Tarek. Arab Culture, Vol. 1: An In-depth Look at Arab Culture Through Cartoons and Popular Art (English and Arabic Edition). Ed. Thane Floreth. 2011 ed. Vol. 1. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; that it is common for Arabs in dinner situations to insist on guests to eat the last piece of the meal or to fight over who will pay the bill at a restaurant for generosity.''

'''Female Infanticide''' 
Like many societies around the world, the preference for a son is much higher than that for a daughter in the Arab world. In pre-Islamic Arabia, husbands would go as far as burying female infants alive because of the shame it caused them among their peers. Women are typically seen as a burden whereas men represent honor and dignity to a family. Muhammad revealed a verse which deals with this phenomenon. It says, "And God will ask the female infant who had been buried alive (''"mau'udda"'') for what wrongdoing was she killed."&lt;ref&gt;[https://quran.com/81/8-9 Surah At-Takwir]&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is long gone in the Arab world, but the sentiment of having a son over a daughter still resides and women are still subject to divorce for failure to give birth to a son as a first born child.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Sports==

===Pan Arab Games===
{{Main article|Pan Arab Games}}
The Pan Arab Games are a regional multi-sport event held between nations from the Arab world. The first Games were held in 1953 in Alexandria, Egypt. Intended to be held every four years since, political turmoil as well as financial difficulties has made the event an unstable one. Women were first allowed to compete in 1985. By the [[2007 Pan Arab Games|11th Pan Arab Games]], the number of countries participating reached all 22 members of the [[Arab League]], with roughly over 8,000 Arab athletes participating, it was considered the largest in the Games History, with the [[2011 Pan Arab Games|Doha Games]] in 2011 expected to exceed that number.

===Arab women in sports===
Women around the world have struggled in the professional world of sports since it has been something that has been dominated by men. When looking at the Arab world currently there is an emergence of Arab women playing sports, something that for the most part is not much discussed but is of great importance. Muslim Arab women are taking part in playing on futsal, football (soccer), softball, basketball, and various other teams. Some women are participating in boxing, archery, running, swimming, tennis and other individual sports. Because more Muslim women are playing sports, sportswear is being developed so that a woman can still be able to participate in sports like swimming without limiting their participation due to the way they choose to dress. Although women have received great support from family members in playing sports, there is still much criticism towards female athletes in the Arab world. Many conservative men have criticized that sports and women do not go together and that a woman would not be able to wear her headscarf or should not wear shorts while playing sports.

Some people do not see Islam and women playing sports as being compatible. Despite the various criticisms Arab women around the Arab world face, it has not stopped the popularity of women’s participation in sports. Football is one of the sports that has exploded in popularity with women in the Arab world. With the coming of the Women’s World Cup in 2011, there is a Women’s Football Cup Arabia occurring in Bahrain which is bringing together women’s teams from all over the Arab world to play in competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muslimwomeninsports.blogspot.com/2010/10/womens-football-cup-arabia-2010-on-road.html |title=Muslim Women in SPORTS: WOMEN'S FOOTBALL CUP ARABIA 2010 - on the road to Germany |publisher=Muslimwomeninsports.blogspot.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are teams in Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Libya and Jordan and events like this show that, as said by Dr. Sahar al Hawary who is a member of FIFA’s Women’s Committee from Egypt, "women's football can be promoted at the highest level and watched in the Arab world... women's football can be promoted at the highest level and watched in the Arab world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/news/newsid=90760.html |title=Princess champions game for Arab women |publisher=FIFA.com |date=2004-02-11 |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab women are also challenging and becoming a part of sports that even outside of the Arab world are considered not for women. There are Arab women who are participating in boxing, even reaching international competition levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cY2p8fjX1s |title=Everywoman - Sport and playing for gold - 30 May 08 - Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab women are not limiting themselves and although they receive criticism from some of society, their families and communities have been very supportive while still considering themselves conservative and faithful to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ2jYLCloFo&amp;feature=channel |title=Everywoman - Sport and playing for gold - 30 May 08 - Part 2 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These women and their families are challenging the very narrow view that society at times has of the capabilities of women and have inspired women all around the Arab world to not limit themselves. Despite this occurring in the Arab world, what these Arab female athletes are doing is an inspiration to women all over the globe.

==Cuisine==
{{Main article|Arab cuisine}}
[[File:Petra metzes.jpg|thumb|200px|A selection of Jordanian [[Meze|mezze]], appetizers or small dishes, in [[Petra]], [[Jordan]].]]
Originally, the Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula relied heavily on a diet of [[date palm|dates]], wheat, barley, rice and meat, with little variety, with a heavy emphasis on yoghurt products, such as [[leben (food)|leben]] (لبن) (yoghurt without butterfat). Arabian cuisine today is the result of a combination of richly diverse cuisines, spanning the Arab world and incorporating [[Levantine cuisine|Levantine]], Egyptian, and others. It has also been influenced to a degree by the cuisines of India, Turkey, Berber, and others. In an average Arab household in the [[Persian Gulf]] area, a visitor might expect a dinner consisting of a very large platter, shared commonly, with a vast mountain of rice, incorporating lamb or chicken, or both, as separate dishes, with various stewed vegetables, heavily spiced, sometimes with a tomato sauce. Most likely, there would be several other items on the side, less hearty. [[Tea]] would certainly accompany the meal, as it is almost constantly consumed. [[Coffee]] would be included as well.

===Tea culture===
{{further|Arabic tea}}
Tea is a very important drink in the Arab world, it is usually served with breakfast, after lunch, and with dinner. For Arabs tea is a hospitality drink that is served to guests. It is also common for Arabs to drink tea with dates.

== Dress ==

===Men===
Arab dress for men ranges from the traditional flowing robes to blue jeans, T-shirts and business suits. The robes allow for maximum circulation of air around the body to help keep it cool, and the head dress provides protection from the sun. At times, Arabs mix the traditional garb with clothes.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/irp/agency/army/arabculture.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thobe'''
In the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] men usually wear their national dress that is called "thobe" but can be also called "Dishdasha" (Kuwait) or "Kandoura" (UAE). "Thobes" differ slightly from state to state within the Gulf, but the basic ones are white. This is the traditional attire that Arabs wear in formal occasions.

'''Headdress'''
The male headdress is also known as [[Keffiyeh]]. Headdress pattern might be an indicator of which tribe, clan, or family the wearer comes from. However, this is not always the case. While in one village, a tribe or clan might have a unique headdress, in the next town over an unrelated tribe or clan might wear the same headdress.
[[File:Jissr-groom.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A wedding carriage in [[Jisr az-Zarqa]], Israel]]
* Checkered headdresses relate to type and government and participation in the [[Hajj]], or a pilgrimage to Mecca.
* Red and white checkered headdress – Generally of Jordanian origin. Wearer has made Hajj and comes from a country with a Monarch.
* Black and white checkered headdress – The pattern is historically of Palestinian origin.
* Black and grey represent Presidential rule and completion of the Hajj.

'''Guthra (headdress) in the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]'''
The male headdress in the Gulf states is called Guthra and it is different in each country (size and shape). It is usually worn with a black cord called "agal" that keeps the guthra on the wearer's head.
* The Qatari guthra is heavily starched and it is known for its "cobra" shape.
* The Saudi guthra is a square shaped cotton fabric. The traditional is white but the white and red (shemagh) is also very common in Saudi Arabia.
* The Emirati guthra is usually white and can be used as a wrapped turban or traditionally with the black agal.

===Women===
Adherence to traditional dress varies across Arab societies. [[Saudi Arabia]] is more traditional, while [[Egypt]] is less so. Traditional Arab dress features the full length body cover ([[abaya]], [[jilbāb]], or [[chador]]) and veil ([[hijab]]). Women are only required to wear ''[[abaya]]s'' in Saudi Arabia. In most countries, like [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Egypt]], the veil is not prevalent.

[[File:S95NormanArcadeEly.jpg|thumb|[[Norman architecture|Norman]] blind arcade, [[Ely Cathedral]]]]

An '''arcade''' is a succession of contiguous [[arch]]es, with each arch supported by [[column]]s, [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. Exterior arcades are designed to provide a sheltered walkway for pedestrians. The walkway may be lined with retail stores.&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; An arcade may feature arches on both sides of the walkway. Alternatively, a [[blind arcade]] superimposes arcading against a solid wall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3FN4VL5lEwC&amp;pg=PA865 James Bettley and Nikolaus Pevsner (2007), ''Essex. The buildings of England'', Yale University Press, page 865]&lt;/ref&gt; Blind arcades are a feature of [[Romanesque architecture]] that influenced [[Gothic architecture]]. In the Gothic architectural tradition, the arcade can be located in the interior, in the lowest part of the wall of the [[nave]], supporting the [[triforium]] and the [[clerestory]] in a [[cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;William Chambers (1973), ''Chambers's encyclopaedia, Volume 1'', International Learning Systems Corp, p. 534&lt;/ref&gt; or on the exterior, in which they are usually part of the walkways that surround the [[courtyard]] and [[cloisters]]. 

Many medieval arcades housed shops or stalls, either in the arcaded space itself, or set into the main wall behind.  From this, "arcade" has become a general word for a group of shops in a single building, regardless of the architectural form. 

The word "arcade" comes from [[French language|French]] ''arcade'' from [[Occitan language|Provençal]] ''arcada'' or [[Italian language|Italian]] ''arcata'', based on [[Latin]] ''arcus'', ‘bow’ (see arc and [[arch]]).&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Arcades go back to at least the [[Ancient Greek architecture]] of the [[Hellenistic period]], and were much used by the Romans, for example at the base of the [[Colosseum]].  Church [[cloister]]s very often use arcading. [[Islamic architecture]] very often uses arcades in and outside [[mosque]]s in particular.  In [[Renaissance architecture]] elegant arcading was often used as a prominent feature of facades, for example in the [[Ospedale degli Innocenti]] (commissioned 1419) or the courtyard of the [[Palazzo Bardi]], both by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] in [[Florence]].

==Shopping arcades==
The French architect, Bertrand Lemoine, described the period, 1786 to 1935, as ''l’Ère des passages couverts'' (the Arcade Era).&lt;ref&gt;Lemoine, B., ''Les Passages Couverts'', Paris: Délégation à l'action artistique de la ville de Paris [AAVP], 1990. {{ISBN|9782905118219}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was referring to the grand shopping "arcades" that flourished across Europe during that period. A shopping arcade refers to a multiple-vendor space, operating under a covered roof. Typically, the roof was constructed of glass to allow for natural light and to reduce the need for candles or electric lighting.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, I., ''Tradition and Innovation in English Retailing, 1700 to 1850,'' Routledge, Oxon, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th and 19th century arcades were designed to attract the genteel middle classes. In time, these arcades became to be the place to shop and to be seen. Arcades offered shoppers the promise of an enclosed space away from the chaos that characterised the noisy, dirty streets; a warm, dry space away from the harsh elements, and a safe haven where people could socialise and spend their leisure time. As thousands of glass covered arcades spread across Europe, they became grander and more ornately decorated. By the mid-nineteenth century, they had become prominent centres of fashion and social life. Promenading in these arcades became a popular nineteenth-century pastime for the emerging middle classes.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping,'' ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 92–95&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Firenze, loggia del Mercato Nuovo (03).jpg|thumb|Loggia del Mercato Nuovo, Florence, Italy]]
The inspiration for the grand shopping arcades may have derived from the open [[loggia]]s of Florence. During the 16th-century, a pattern of market trading using mobile stalls under covered arcades was established in Florence, from where it spread throughout Italy. Examples of the earliest open [[loggia]]s include: [[Loggia del Mercato Nuovo|Mercato Nuovo]] (1547) by Giovanni Battista del Tasso (and funded by the [[House of Medici|Medici family]]); Mercato Vecchio, Florence by [[Giorgio Vasari]] (1567) and [[Loggia del Grano, Florence|Loggia del Grano]] (1619) by [[Giulio Parigi]].&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, N., ''A History of Building Types,'' Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 235; Goy, R.J., ''Florence: A Walking Guide to Its Architecture,'' Yale University Press, 2015; Codini, E.K. (ed), ''Architettura a Pisa nel Primo Periodo Mediceo, Gangemi, 2003, p.213&lt;/ref&gt;

Arcades soon spread across Europe, North America and the Antipodes. Examples of these grand shopping arcades include: [[Palais Royal]] in Paris (opened in 1784); Passage de Feydeau in Paris (opened in 1791); London's [[Piccadilly Arcade]] (1810) and Milan's [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II|Galleria Vittorio Emanuele]] (1878).&lt;ref&gt;Sassatelli, R., ''Consumer Culture: History, Theory and Politics,'' Sage, 2007, p. 27; Although the author specifically names Piccadilly Arcade, it is possible that she intended [[Burlington Arcade]] in Piccadilly. &lt;/ref&gt; Other notable nineteenth century grand arcades include the [[Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert]] in Brussels which was inaugurated in 1847 and Istanbul's [[Çiçek Pasajı]] opened in 1870. Shopping arcades were the precursor to the modern [[shopping mall]], and the word "arcade" is now often used for malls which do not use the architectural form at all.

The [[Palais-Royal]], which opened in 1784 and became one of the most important marketplaces in Paris, is generally regarded as the earliest example of the grand shopping arcades.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, I., ''Tradition and Innovation in English Retailing, 1700 to 1850,'' Routledge, Oxon, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, a royal palace, the complex consisted of gardens, shops and entertainment venues situated under the original colonnades. The area boasted some 145 boutiques, cafés, salons, hair salons, bookshops, museums, and numerous refreshment kiosks as well as two theatres. The retail outlets specialised in luxury goods such as fine jewellery, furs, paintings and furniture designed to appeal to the wealthy elite. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex were among the first in Europe to abandon the system of bartering, and adopt fixed-prices thereby sparing their clientele the hassle of bartering. Stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, frequented by both the aristocracy and the middle classes. It developed a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation, revolving around the salons, cafés, and bookshops, but also became a place frequented by off-duty soldiers and was a favourite haunt of prostitutes, many of whom rented apartments in the building.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne-Paquet, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping,'' ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 90–93&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the earliest British examples of a shopping arcade, the [[Covered Market, Oxford]], England was officially opened on 1 November 1774 and is still active today.  The Covered Market was started in response to a general wish to clear "untidy, messy and unsavoury stalls" from the main streets of central Oxford. [[John Gwynn (architect)|John Gwynn]], the architect of [[Magdalen Bridge]], drew up the plans and designed the High Street front with its four entrances. In 1772, the newly formed Market committee, half of whose members came from the town and half from the university, accepted an estimate of nine hundred and sixteen pounds ten shillings, for the building of twenty butchers' shops. Twenty more soon followed, and after 1773 meat was allowed to be sold only inside the market. From this nucleus the market grew, with stalls for garden produce, pig meat, dairy products and fish.

[[Great Gostiny Dvor|Gostiny Dvor]] in [[St Petersburg]], [[Russia]] is another early shopping arcade.&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?q=%22One+of+the+oldest+shopping+arcades+in+the+world&amp;btnG=Search+Books--&gt; Sprawling at the intersection of [[Nevsky Prospekt]] and [[Sadovaya Street]] for over one kilometer and embracing the area of {{convert|53000|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}, the indoor complex of more than 100 shops took twenty-eight years to construct. Building commenced in 1757 to an elaborate design by [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]], but that subsequently was discarded in favour of a less expensive and more functional [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] design submitted by [[Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe]] (1729–1800).

Throughout the following century, Gostiny Dvor was augmented, resulting in ten indoor streets and as many as 178 shops by the 20th century. During the post-[[World War II]] reconstructions, its inner walls were demolished and a huge shopping mall came into being. This massive 18th-century structure got a face-lift recently and entered the 21st century as one of the most fashionable shopping centres in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Bogdanov, I.A. , ''Bolshoi Gostiny dvor v Peterburge''. SPb, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

An early French arcade is the Passage du Caire created in 1798 as a tribute to the [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria]]. It was appreciated by the public for its protection from the weather, noise and filth of the streets.&lt;ref&gt;p. 174 Desmons, Gilles ''Walking Paris'' New Holland Publishers, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  A year later American architect William Thayer created the [[Passage des Panoramas]] with a row of shops passing between two [[panorama]] paintings. Shopping arcades increasingly were built in the second [[Bourbon Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 386 Ayers, Andrew  ''The Architecture of Paris: An Architectural Guide'' Edition Axel Menges, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Upper levels of arcades often contained apartments&lt;ref&gt;p. 32 Benjamin, Walter &amp; Tiedemann, Rolf ''The Arcades Project'' Harvard University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes [[brothel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;p. 88 Rabaté, Jean-Michel ''Given: 10 Art 20 Crime : Modernity, Murder and Mass Culture'' Sussex Academic Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ascent of the Blessed''''' is a [[Hieronymus Bosch]] painting made between 1505 and 1515. It is in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], in [[Venice]], Italy.

This painting is part of a [[polyptych]] of four panels entitled ''Visions of the Hereafter''. The others are ''[[Terrestrial Paradise (Bosch)|Terrestrial Paradise]]'', ''[[Fall of the Damned into Hell]]'' and ''[[Hell (Bosch)|Hell]]''.

==Formal Analysis==

The most intriguing element of this painting is the large tunnel at the top of the panel. It appears from the perspective of looking through a straw and into the heavenly beyond. As Stephen Hitchens writes, it could also be described as a “funnel of goodness and light [as] a source of variety and surprise capturing the visionary and ecstatic union with God.”&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens,''Art as History, History as Art,''109.&lt;/ref&gt; The three dimensional tunnel gives the viewer a peek of the “white light” from Heaven with three figures waiting at the end for the blessed. The near side of the tunnel has one angel carrying a human soul towards the pearly gates. The viewer can differentiate the two figures because one has a white robe with wings and the other is naked, thus a soul and an angel. Both have their hands in prayer formation.

Right beneath the tunnel, there is an array of angels helping blessed human souls towards salvation. In the lower parts of the panel there are two angels per one soul, suggesting that some humans need more help than others. As it gets closer to the top of the panel, there is a one to one ratio of angel and soul. This might symbolize that the human souls that are pulled from Earth’s gravity and towards the tunnel become lighter in weight. The angels have their hands either on the human body carrying it upwards or near the body simply guiding it where to go. All the figures in the painting are looking upwards towards the tunnel.

All the characters have similar facial features because the physical aspect of the humans and angels are more idealized and not individualized. The figures are not meant to look like specific individual people. The style of the hair is also quite idealized; the angels have long wavy hair and the souls have short hair. None of the human souls have organs to help differentiate whether they are male or female. This could be a form of symbolism which shows that there are no genders in Heaven. This could be implying that all human souls are no longer differentiated by sexual organs and everyone is the same. The angels have a multitude of different colored robes and wings, such as subtle reds, blues, and greens.

The painting as a whole is very dimly lit which contrasts with the white brightness at the end of the tunnel. The light at the end of the tunnel is not the light that lights up the bottom of the painting, which is most likely the earthly realm. The extreme darkness directly around the tunnel indicates that the heavenly light has nothing to do with the light coming from below. The areas outside the tunnel are dark and gray. The light actually becomes darker as it moves upwards then when it reaches the tunnel there is a sudden eruption of light. Coincidentally, this painting of the funnel has been known to look very similar to people who have had near-death experiences. During the fifteenth-century, the entrance to paradise was depicted as a funnel which appeared in many miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;Baldass,''Hieronymus Bosch,''224.&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of the radiant funnel actually has some resemblance to contemporary zodiac diagrams but Bosch transforms it into a shining corridor through which the blessed approach God.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson,''Hieronymus Bosch,''64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Context==

Bosch’s paintings reflect the religious themes that dominated art and society in the [[Netherlands]] during the sixteenth century, especially the [[Catholic]] religion. Almost everyone’s duty was to behave and act like a good Catholic so that they could ascend into heaven. The consequences of sin were made so awful to frighten the faithful obedience into people with the ultimate punishments of weakening in purgatory and being sent to Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.,73.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Reuterswärd, the limited number of people being admitted into Heaven “illustrates the remarkable specification contained in a treatise entitled ''Van der Vorsieningkeit Godes'', which circulated in the Netherlands in Bosch’s time, that out of 30,000 souls only two were likely to reach Heaven.”&lt;ref&gt;Reuterswärd,"Hieronymus Bosch's Four "Afterlife" Panels in Venice,"34.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Bosch read this [[treatise]] will never be known for sure, however it is known that there was a high number of [[monks]] and nuns that lived in his home city. It was even called “a pious city” because of its high quantity of [[confraternities]] and religious houses.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens,''Art as History, History as Art,''37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrangement of polyptych==
Bosch scholars have other interpretations about the meaning behind these paintings, especially Ascent of the Blessed. The panels may come off straight forward and simple but there is a lot of dispute about the order of the panels and how they should be positioned in a museum. When hung in Venice in 2011, the order of the panels was ''[[Fall of the Damned into Hell]]'', ''[[Hell]]'', space, ''[[Terrestrial Paradise (Bosch)|Terrestrial Paradise]]'', and ''Ascent of the Blessed''. The ''Terrestrial Paradise'' was placed on the left because it resembles other Eden panels by Bosch, especially with its landscape, fountain, and following biblical convention.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens,''Art as History, History as Art,''109.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also confusion on whether the ''Terrestrial Paradise''  is even “paradise” because it might also be Purgatory. Another possible arrangement is ''Ascent'', ''Paradise'', ''Hell'' and the ''Fall'' which takes inspiration from Matthew 25: 32-3 in the Bible. The idea is that traditionally; God directs the damned to Hell on his left side.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bosch scholar, [[Ludwig von Baldass]], does not mention any other possible arrangements and feels that “the wings are divided into two portions, one above the other, representing on the left the figures of the saved being escorted by angels into Paradise and on the right the fall of the damned into Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Baldass,''Hieronymus Bosch,''27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars believe that Visions of the Hereafter are the wings to a missing middle panel which would presumably be the Last Judgement.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens,''Art as History, History as Art,''108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics are not unanimous in attributing these panels to Bosch, however it would be difficult to ascribe their compositions to anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson,''Hieronymus Bosch,''62.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also speculation about how these designs came to surface through Bosch, whether they are simply just from his mind or dreams. During the sixteenth-century many people would attempt to stimulate themselves into spiritual awakening to get as close to God as possible. Thus, these might have been some of the visions people saw when attempting to jump into the unconscious depth and mystery of the spiritual visions.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens,''Art as History, History as Art,''111.&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-profit membership-based registered charity, the '''Council for the Arts in [[Ottawa]] (CAO)''' champions the [[arts]] as the bedrock for an engaged citizenry in a vibrant growing [[community]]. It focuses on services for its diverse membership. Through [[advocacy]], [[information]] and [[advice (opinion)|advice]] to members, it seeks to increase [[public interest]] and support for the arts in the [[national capital region]]. Its membership includes over 200 [[artists]] and arts organizations, and individual and corporate supporters of the arts.

== Mandate ==
The CAO works to raise the profile of the arts in Ottawa, develop arts policy, and educate the public on issues that affect the arts community. Through strengthening relationships with government and offering specialized services to its members, the Council promotes a more robust financial commitment to the arts and aims to reflect the region's shifting cultural identity.

== Funding ==
The Council is funded primarily by the [[City of Ottawa]] and the [[Ontario Arts Council]]. Each year it receives additional funding from multiple sources, including corporations, foundations, and other government bodies.

== Governance ==
Former textile designer Ottawa-born Peter Honeywell is the Executive Director of the Council.&lt;ref name="Profile"&gt;[http://www.arts-ottawa.on.ca/news/2007/sandra-tulloch-en.php Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010112823/http://www.arts-ottawa.on.ca/news/2007/sandra-tulloch-en.php |date=2007-10-10 }} CAO website&lt;/ref&gt; He has held the position since 1991, and as well as acting as an advisor to boards and other arts organizations, Honeywell has been a member of the Ontario Minister's Advisory Council for Art and Culture since 2010.&lt;ref name="Profile"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pas.gov.on.ca/scripts/en/BoardDetails.asp?boardID=141061 Minister's Advisory Council For Arts and Culture] Profiles of Advisory Council members&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAO is led by a 12-member [[Board of Directors]] with Mr. Honeywell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts-ottawa.on.ca/aboutus/board-en.php Board of Directors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827175133/http://www.arts-ottawa.on.ca/aboutus/board-en.php |date=2011-08-27 }} CAO website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief history ==
Based on a recommendation from the Mayor of Ottawa's Advisory Committee on the Arts, the CAO was founded in 1982.&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.arts-ottawa.on.ca/aboutus/history-en.php About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827175125/http://www.arts-ottawa.on.ca/aboutus/history-en.php |date=2011-08-27 }} CAO website&lt;/ref&gt; It produced a 17-day arts festival featuring 65 events that showcased the arts across disciplines. Council activities also included producing catalogues, managing a space for 40 working artists and a gallery, publishing a bi-monthly 28-page tabloid, producing provincial and regional conferences, advocacy, skills workshops and special arts projects.&lt;ref&gt;

By 1990, the CAO was running a major deficit. After community consultations, the Council downsized and refocused its efforts from arts production to providing services to artists and arts organizations in the region.&lt;ref name=about /&gt; Through an aggressive program to restore the Council to fiscal health, the CAO's debt was eliminated in its entirety by 1994.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

== Partners, programs, and activities ==
With partners, the CAO has founded five awards granted annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ottawacitizen.com/2012/04/25/grey-smith-tsui-win-ottawa-arts-awards/ Grey, Smith, Tsui win Ottawa arts awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621015551/http://blogs.ottawacitizen.com/2012/04/25/grey-smith-tsui-win-ottawa-arts-awards/ |date=2012-06-21 }} Arts blog, The Ottawa Citizen, April 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; They include the Business Recognition Award that acknowledges businesses that have made a significant contribution to the local arts community, and the [[Victor Tolgesy]] Arts Award, established in memory of the Hungarian-born Ottawa-based

Key partners include [[CARFAC]] Ontario, Ottawa Arts Court Foundation, AOE Arts Council, Ottawa Art Gallery, Culture Days and the [[City of Ottawa]].

In 2010-11, the Council completed a landmark two-year research project, ''Arts and the Capital City''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts-ottawa.on.ca/docs/ACC/index-en.php Arts &amp; the Capital City Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918003357/http://www.arts-ottawa.on.ca/docs/ACC/index-en.php |date=2012-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report explored the many dimensions of the arts in the nation's capital including capital funding, infrastructure, and sustainable arts practices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/struggle+arts+radar/3612076/story.html The struggle to get arts on the radar] Cobb, Chris.

''The Ottawa Citizen'', February 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the Harris government cutbacks to the arts in the late 1990s, the CAO was involved in developing Community Arts Ontario, a provincial network of organizations and individuals that support the arts.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

In the 2000s, CAO threw itself into the campaign for the reinstatement of a proposed $500,000 cut to arts funding in the municipal budget by working with other arts organizations and individuals.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2000/11/01/ott_arts001101.html Candidates would restore arts funding increase] CBC News, November 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Together they developed two Ottawa arts awareness campaigns. A campaign called ''My Ottawa includes Culture'' was launched in 2004.&lt;ref name="Arts community expects budget cuts"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; Through town hall meetings, demonstrations and information campaigns, the cuts were eventually reversed.

The Council always invites the sitting Mayor to deliver a keynote speech to the ''Sweetheart Lunch for the Arts'', and the "un-invitation" was interpreted as a response to the cuts and dramatically raised the public profile of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=1646023971&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=58622&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD Mayor 'uninvited'to Sweetheart Lunch] ''The Ottawa Citizen'', February 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2009/02/05/pf-8272066.html The art of poor diplomacy in Ottawa] Sherring, Susan. ''The Ottawa Sun'', February 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the combined efforts of all the arts organizations and supporters of the arts fighting the cuts, the proposed $6 million cuts were reversed.

== Location ==
The CAO offices and board room are located in rented premises at the Arts Court, Ottawa's central municipal cultural complex. The building was constructed in 1870 and was the Carleton County Courthouse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=8442&amp;pid=0 Carleton County Courthouse] on Canada's Historic Places, a federal, provincial &amp; territorial collaboration&lt;/ref&gt; The Micaela Fitch Room, the Council's board room, was renovated by CAO volunteers in 1999. The work revealed a 14-foot brick vaulted ceiling and arched windows. Since its complete restoration, the space is used for meetings, classes, auditions, workshops and receptions.

For CAE, tactical media is situational, ephemeral, and self-terminating. It encourages the use of any media that will engage a particular socio-political context in order to create molecular interventions and semiotic shocks that collectively could diminish the rising intensity of authoritarian culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.critical-art.net/TacticalMedia.html Critical Art Ensemble]&lt;/ref&gt;
Since its formation in 1987 in Tallahassee, Florida,{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} CAE has been frequently invited to exhibit and perform projects examining issues surrounding information, communications and bio-technologies by museums and other cultural institutions. These include the Whitney Museum and the New Museum in NYC; the Corcoran Museum in Washington D.C.; the ICA, London; the MCA, Chicago; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt; Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; the London Museum of Natural History; Kunsthalle Luzern, and dOCUMENTA 13.

The collective has written 7 books, and its writings have been translated into 18 languages.

Its work has been covered by art journals, including Artforum, Kunstforum, and The Drama Review. Critical Art Ensemble is the recipient of awards, including the 2007 Andy Warhol Foundation Wynn Kramarsky Freedom of Artistic Expression Grant, the 2004 John Lansdown Award for Multimedia, and the 2004 Leonardo New Horizons Award for Innovation.

==History==

===1986–1990===

Formed in 1987, CAE's focus has been on the exploration of the intersections between art, [[critical theory]], technology, and political activism. In 1986, [[Steve Kurtz]] and Steve Barnes began a collaboration to make low-tech videos with students. They credited each person who contributed to the productions under the signature of Critical Art Ensemble. During the summer of 1987, the group transformed into a broad-based artist and activist collective with six core members: Steve Kurtz, Steve Barnes, Dorian Burr, Beverly Schlee, [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)]] and Hope Kurtz. In 1987, the group's first multimedia exhibitions were held at Club Nu in Miami and Pappy's Lounge in Jackson, Mississippi. In 1988, the group's first events are produced: ''Political Art In Florida?'' in collaboration with [[Group Material]], and ''Frontier Production'' in collaboration with [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]]. In 1988-89, CAE begin to release their books of plagiarist text poetry (of which there are six in all). In 1989, the group collaborate with [[Gran Fury]] to release ''Cultural Vaccines'', a multimedia event in Tallahassee, Florida, which critiques U.S. policy on HIV. In 1990, the group collaborated with Prostitutes of New York to create ''Peep Show'' which premiered at Window on Gaines in Tallahassee, Florida.

===1991–1995===

In 1991, a body of work titled ''Fiesta Critica'' was developed in Indiantown, Florida, with local migrant workers; addressing Floridian agricultural labour relations. CAE produces an Easter fiesta platform to show the works. In 1992, the group produces ''Exit Culture'' as a series of works developed for [[Highway Culture]]. They also propose ''The Electronic Disturbance'' to [[Autonomedia]] publishers. In 1993, the group is invited to perform their first appearance in Europe at the Audio/Visual Experimental festival in the Netherlands. They complete the associational documentary series ''Apocalypse and Utopia''. In 1994, [[Autonomedia]] publishes ''The Electronic Disturbance'' and construction begins to create CAE's website [http://www.critical-art.net Critical Art Ensemble]. CAE projects begin to appear in both real and virtual forms as the ''Useless Technology'' project is performed as street action and launched online. The concept of electronic civil disobedience is introduced at the ''Terminal Futures'' conference in London. In 1995, the concept of the data body is introduced in lectures at the [[Ars Electronica]]. The group tours around Europe with the performance of ''Body Count''.

===1996–2000===

In 1996, [[Autonomedia]] publishes ''Electronic Civil Disobedience'' (the companion text to ''The Electronic Disturbance''), and research begins for the book ''Flesh Machine''. In 1997, the group tours ''Flesh Frontiers and Shareholder's Briefing''. [[Castelvecchi]] publishes the Italian translation of ''The Electronic Disturbance''. The group goes to [[Documenta X]] in Kassel, Germany to begin the editing and conceptualizing process for the book ''README: Ascii Culture and the Revenge of Knowledge'' at Hybrid Workspace. The performance of ''Flesh Machine'' is toured, premiering in Vienna and closing in Helsinki at Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art in summer 1998. [[L'Eclat]] publishes the French anthology of CAE's writings titled ''La Resistance Electronique''. In 1998, [[Autonomedia]] publishes ''Flesh Machine'' and the German translation is published by Passagen. The group's street action occurs in Sheffield, UK, with the performance of ''The International Campaign for Free Alcohol and Tobacco for the Unemployed''. [[Castelvecchi]] publishes the Italian translation of ''Electronic Civil Disobedience''. In 1999, ''The Society for Reproductive Anachronisms'' is premiered at Rutgers University in the student cafeteria. Work begins on ''Cult of the New Eve'' (CoNE) and is premiered at St. Clara Hospital in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. A new book project is begun, entitled ''Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media''. In 2000, [[Autonomedia]] publishes ''Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media'' and the German anthology of CAE's writings on electronic media is published by Passagen.&lt;ref&gt;
Critical Art Ensemble, 'Timeline', pp. 132-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has exhibited and performed at diverse venues internationally, ranging from the street, to the museum, to the internet. Museum exhibitions include the Whitney Museum and The New Museum in NYC; The Corcoran Museum in Washington D.C.; The ICA, London; The MCA, Chicago; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt; Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; and The London Museum of Natural History.

===2003–2004===
Free Range Grain was a performance-based project which tested foods to contest the global food trade system. The project used basic molecular biology techniques over a 72-hour period to test foods that others deemed suspicious of "contamination" even when the authorities were guarding against them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.critical-art.net/Biotech.html Critical Art Ensemble]&lt;/ref&gt; This performance sought to explore biotechnology and the science behind it, as the artists felt it was "one of the most misunderstood areas of production in the cultural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.critical-art.net/FRG.html Critical Art Ensemble]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works and artistic approach==

===Performance style===
In its performances, CAE creates various performative identities, such as that of a group of scientists or a corporation. Instead of using fancy, high-tech machinery they use 'high school lab equipment as well as common household supplies and groceries',&lt;ref name="sholette1"&gt;Sholette 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; which brings the scientific difficulty down to a level at which the public can understand and engage with because the worlds of science and technology in the modern world are 'increasingly privatised'.&lt;ref name="sholette1"&gt;Sholette 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; This playful style, however, contrasts with the groups numerous books and manifestos which have an analytical focus.&lt;ref name="sholette1"&gt;Sholette 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicola Triscott is the founder of [[Arts Catalyst|The Arts Catalyst]]. In her writings about the CAE, she states that their participatory theatre 'aims to involve the public in the processes of biotechnology in order to contribute to the development of an informed and critical public discourse on contemporary bioscience'.&lt;ref name="triscott2"&gt;Triscott 2009, p.151.&lt;/ref&gt; This provides people with knowledge of how science can be interesting and that it can be misused if in the wrong hands. Their works have ranged from genetically modified food, the Human Genome Project (CoNE), reproductive technologies, genetic screening and transgenics. The way they approach this style is through directly engaging with the science and presenting techniques generally unknown to the public in a performative way.&lt;ref name="triscott2"&gt;Triscott 2009, p.151.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The work of the CAE continues to entertain, inform and show the public how biotechnology can be demonstrated via performance.&lt;ref name="sholette1"&gt;Sholette 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; 

:As part of their critical objectives, they target their attention on private corporations unknown in the public sector who misuse biotechnology. This tactical response is what the CAE have termed 'Fuzzy Biological Sabotage' (or FBS if abbreviated).&lt;ref&gt;Sholette 2005, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Using harmless biological species including plants, insects and reptiles, they make sophisticated pranks 'to operate in the grey, in-between spaces as yet unregulated by institutional regimes'&lt;ref&gt;Sholette 2005, p. 52. cited in [http://www.critical-art.net/MolecularInvasion.html ''Molecular Invasion'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===

The collective has written 7 books, and its writings have been translated into 18 languages. Its books include: ''The Electronic Disturbance'' (1994), ''Electronic Civil Disobedience &amp; Other Unpopular Ideas'' (1996), ''Flesh Machine: Cyborgs, Designer Babies, &amp; New Eugenic Consciousness'' (1998), ''Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media'' (2001), ''Molecular Invasion'' (2002), ''Marching Plague'' (2006), and the project book ''Disturbances'' (2012).

CAE is noted for having written the article [http://www.critical-art.net/books/ted/ted2.pdf Nomadic Power and Cultural Resistance], in which CAE argues that with the creation of the [[internet]] the power of the elite has become mobile to the extent that it is difficult for a dissident to directly confront the authority, comparing the untrackable, elusive mobility to that of the [[Scythians]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Electronic Disturbance'', 11-30. New York: Autonomoedia, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; They demolished the idea that power cannot corrupt and co-opt network and hypertext technologies, that such technologies have a predetermined and manifest destiny of freedom.&lt;ref name="reader2003"&gt;The New Media Reader. New York: The MIT, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; CAE goes on to observe that occupation theory &lt;!-- why is there no page on this theory? --&gt;itself is challenged by [[cyberspace]] and the difficulties it presents in terms of focusing a group effort against one authority as opposed to a singular hacker, fiddling with code. An important distinction is made that when rebellious acts are carried out by an individual as opposed to a group in singularity, that the dissenter is seen as a vandal instead of a protester. The article mentions that resistance in the form posters, pamphleteering, street theater and public art have been useful in the past but now that the public is electronically engaged one must bring their resistance methods online.
&lt;ref name="reader2003"/&gt;

===Molecular Invasion===

In correlation to CAE's work "Molecular Invasion (2002)" the collective hosted an exhibit about genetically modified crops. They planted [[Monsanto]]'s genetically modified seeds that were designed to be immune to Monsanto's commercial pesticide [[Roundup (herbicide)|roundup]] (Glyphosate). They successfully grew these crops in their exhibit however once the plants were fully grown they applied an enzyme inhibitor that was reverse engineered to the plants that eradicated the protection that these crops had against the pesticide. The plants quickly died. This exhibit was a statement against genetically modified foods.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Cult of the New Eve===

In 1999, CAE began a new project to draw attention to the ways in which scientific discourses surrounding biotechnologies drew upon promissory religious rhetoric. This participatory performance was titled ''Cult of the New Eve'' (or CoNE when abbreviated) and included a "communion" using a random library of the entire genome of the first female donor to the [[Human Genome Project]] taken from a blood sample. CAE spliced the genome and inserted it into yeast, which was then placed into host wafers and beer given to audience members who were willing to participate. The genome from the donor is intended to represent a 'New Eve… a sacrosant Messiah'.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Art Ensemble 2000, pp.167-173&lt;/ref&gt; The project also offers public and online preaching, baptisms, communion, sacred theological and cosmological texts and prophecies.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Art Ensemble, 'Performing a Cult', pp.167-173&lt;/ref&gt;

CAE created a performance titled ''GenTerra'' which raised issues surrounding ethics and safety in performative science. This was done through an investigation into creating transgenic life forms and seeing the consequences of potentially releasing them into the environment. It was the audience members who had to decide whether the bacteria was harmful or not in a game of 'genetic Russian roulette'.&lt;ref name="triscott3"&gt;Triscott 2009, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Triscott states through her own experience of participating in the performance that members of the audience were given the opportunity to grow and store their own bacteria, with full instructions and guidance. With the aid of a spinning machine, bacteria were spun with only one of ten chambers holding active bacteria. The purpose of ''GenTerrra'' is to 'introduce bioproducts to the audience, and demonstrate the practical applications of such research, such as disease treatment and xenotransplantation'.&lt;ref name="triscott3"&gt;Triscott 2009, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; As CAE wear lab-coats and appear as professional scientists, they simulate actual biotechnology corporations, emphasizing their intentions even further.&lt;ref&gt;Triscott 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collective structure===
CAE attributes the collective's longevity to their structure which has contributed to positive attitudes throughout the group. The number of members, ranging from three to eight and known as a 'cellular structure'&lt;ref name="critical1"&gt;Critical Art Ensemble 2001, pp.70-73&lt;/ref&gt; has managed to be sustained without members feeling alienated. As each member has the opportunity to show off their individual strengths and weaknesses, the risk of conflict and mistrust is reduced. They do not believe in equality; rather that every member has 'a voice in the production process [of a project]; however the member with the greatest expertise in the area has authority over the final product'.&lt;ref name="critical1"/&gt;

===Amateurism===
CAE has also stated that amateurs have the ability to see through dominant paradigms, are more free to recombine elements of paradigms thought long dead, and can apply everyday life experience to their deliberations. Most important, however, amateurs are not invested in institutional systems of knowledge production and policy construction, and hence do not have irresistible forces guiding the outcome of their process…'.&lt;ref&gt;Sholette 2005, p.52. cited in Critical Art Ensemble 2001, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future projects===

'Since 2006, CAE has changed the focus of its work towards a critique of US defense policy, and has moved away from its interrogation of biotechnology'.&lt;ref&gt;Triscott 2009, p.166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Steve Kurtz's Trial===
In 2004, one of its founders, [[Steve Kurtz]], was arrested on suspicion of [[bioterrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/arts/design/03kenn.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin|title=The Artists in the Hazmat Suits|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=July 3, 2005|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 11 May 2004, he woke to find that his wife Hope had died in her sleep. He called 911. Police became suspicious after noticing his biology lab which he kept in his own home. They contacted the FBI and Kurtz was detained for 24 hours before being interrogated and his house searched for biohazardous materials. The house was given the all clear, yet a week later, Kurtz's CAE collaborators were ordered to appear before a grand jury to investigate possible violations of the law regarding biological weapons. The jury met in July 2004 and cleared Kurtz of all "bioterrorism" charges, however the FBI continued to press charges against the artist and the case dragged on for four years.&lt;ref&gt;Triscott 2009, p.154.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was widely covered in the US and international press, and sparked outrage among artists and scientists worldwide. A website was created for people to donate money to help Kurtz pay his mounting legal fees. The case was dismissed in 2008. [http://caedefensefund.org -- CAE DEFENSE FUND --] According to Nicola Triscott, the FBI 'thought they had a situation out of which they could manufacture a terrorism case, which potentially brought great personal rewards', based upon the 'Lackawanna Six Sleeper Cell' case where six Yemeni Americans were convicted of supporting al-Qaeda&lt;ref&gt;Triscott 2009, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Davenport Group''' is the informal name of a nationally known group of early [[Modernist literature|modernist]] writers who first came together in [[Davenport, Iowa]]. In the early 20th century, they migrated east to New York City to assume leading roles in several important artistic and cultural developments in the 1910s and 1920s. Core members of the group are [[Susan Glaspell]], her husband [[George Cram Cook]], who were among the founders of the [[Provincetown Players]]; [[Floyd Dell]], and [[Arthur Davison Ficke]]. Other Davenport writers associated with the group include [[Alice French]], [[Charles Eugene Banks]], [[Nilla Cram Cook]] (daughter of Glaspell and Cook), and [[Harry Hansen (author)|Harry Hansen]].

==Background==
In the last decades of the nineteenth century, Davenport was a prosperous and cosmopolitan port city on the upper [[Mississippi River]] and center of trade. By 1890 local author [[Alice French]] had become the first Iowa writer with a national reputation. In the mid-1890s writer [[Charles Eugene Banks]] moved to Davenport from Chicago, and started a weekly newspaper devoted to literature and local social life. Over the next decade Banks would mentor several young local aspiring writers ([[Susan Glaspell]], [[George Cram Cook]], and [Floyd Dell]]) who would constitute the Davenport group. Though inspired and influenced by French's success, the socially progressive younger writers rejected her starkly conservative views.

As the young writers began to find success publishing their works, they left Davenport to advance their careers in Chicago and New York. Glaspell and Cook had married before going to New York. Together they had a daughter, Nilla Cram Cook, and son, Harl Cook. Nilla later became a writer. 

George "Jig" Cram Cook led the founding of the [[Provincetown Players]] in the summer of 1915. Considered the first modern American theatre company,&lt;ref&gt;Sarlós, Robert K. (1984). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1542-734X.1984.0703_65.x/abstract "The Provincetown Players' Genesis or Non-Commercial Theatre on Commercial Streets"], ''Journal of American Culture'', Vol. 7, Issue 3 (Fall 1984), pp.&amp;nbsp;65–70&lt;/ref&gt; it was famed for producing the first plays of [[Eugene O'Neill]]. In addition to participating in the theater, Glaspell became "one of America's most widely read novelists", and she won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1931 for one of her play ''[[Alison's House]]''. In addition, her short stories were regularly published in the top periodicals. 

Dell became a best-selling novelist and leading critic and editor; he is known for influencing many major American writers of the first half of the 20th century. [[Arthur Davison Ficke]] stayed in Davenport longer, becoming a lawyer in his father's firm. While practicing law, he still established himself as a nationally appreciated poet. He eventually quit law and followed his friends to New York to focus on writing.&lt;!--What about Charles Eugene Banks and Harry Hansen? If in the lead, they have to be discussed in body of article  --&gt;

The '''detachment of wall paintings''' involves the removal of a [[Mural|wall painting]] from the structure of which it formed part. Once a common practice, with the move towards preservation ''in situ'', detachment is now largely restricted to cases where the only alternative is total loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://projekte.hawk-hhg.de/ewaglos/pages/download.php|title=EwaGlos.

These operations are, therefore, only justifiable in extreme cases when all options of in situ treatment are not viable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.international.icomos.org/charters/wallpaintings_e.pdf |title=Principles for the Preservation and Conservation-Restoration of Wall Paintings (Article 6: Emergency Measures) |publisher=[[ICOMOS]] |year=2003 |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Vitruvius]] records how in [[Sparta]], in 59 BC, "paintings have been taken out of certain walls by cutting through the bricks, enclosed in wooden frames, and brought to the [[Comitium]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0072%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D8%3Asection%3D9 |title=Vitruvius, ''De Architectura'' II.8.9 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, apprised of paintings of [[Atalanta]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] without drapery and "enflamed with lust", [[Caligula]] attempted to carry them off, but was prevented by the makeup of the [[Plaster#In art|plaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D35%3Achapter%3D6 |title=Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' XXXV.6.17-18 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amedeo Maiuri|Maiuri]] cites examples of wall paintings in wooden frames excavated at [[Pompeii]], a precursor to [[Pompeii#Rediscovery|what was to follow]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Motivation==
In their study, Mora, Mora, and Philippot cite four reasons for the "over-use" of detachment: the 19th-century division of [[the arts]] that privileged a "painting" divorced from its architectural and historical context; insensitivity to the [[aesthetic]] consequences, often partially concealed by [[Conservation-restoration|restorers]]; the curiosity of [[Art history|art historians]] looking for ''[[Sinopia|sinopie]]''; or perceived savings relating to the initial cost of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conservation of Wall Paintings |author1=Mora, Paolo |author2=Mora, Laura |author3=Philippot, Paul |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann|Butterworths]] |year=1984 |pages=245f |ISBN=0-408-10812-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial gain and exploitation as consumer goods by collectors, dealers and restorers provides another possible incentive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reversibility - Does it Exist? |editor1=Oddy, Andrew |editor1-link=William Andrew Oddy |editor2=Carroll, Sara |publisher=[[British Museum Press#British Museum Press|British Museum Press]] |year=1999 |ISBN=0-86159-135-6 |chapter=Aspects of reversibility in transferred paintings |pages=64f |author=Brajer, Isabelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This process enables nowadays' companies to offer their customers an authentic fresco, created in their laboratory according to the ancient technique and transferred onto a canvas to be shipped to the place of installation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italian-frescos.com/come-nasce-un-affresco-strappato-da-muro/?lang=en How is a fresco detached from a wall? - Fresco Blog] by Italian Fresco Blog.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changing values ===
{{main|Values (heritage)}}
As the values of a society change, so to does its attitude towards works of the past.

== Techniques ==

There are three main methods, typically referred to by their [[Italian language|Italian]] terms, namely ''stacco a massello'', involving detachment and removal of painting, [[Plaster#In art|render]], and some or all of the mural support; ''stacco'' or detachment of the painting with render alone; and ''strappo'', ''lit.'' "tearing", lifting of only the paint layer, attached to a facing with [[adhesive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conservation of Wall Paintings |author1=Mora, Paolo |author2=Mora, Laura |author3=Philippot, Paul |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann|Butterworths]] |year=1984 |pages=246–260 |ISBN=0-408-10812-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case the resulting material must be applied to a new support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conservation of Wall Paintings |author1=Mora, Paolo |author2=Mora, Laura |author3=Philippot, Paul |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann|Butterworths]] |year=1984 |pages=262–281 |ISBN=0-408-10812-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Minimum intervention and reversibility are core [[Conservation-restoration#Definition|conservation ethics]] that favour preservation ''in situ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Transfer of Wallpaintings; based on Danish experience |author=Brajer, Isabelle |publisher=Archetype Publications |year=2002 |ISBN=978-1-873132-43-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mosaics make a Site: The conservation ''in situ'' of mosaics on archaeological sites |chapter=Philosophies favouring ''in situ'' conservation |pages=17–29 |publisher=ICCM |editor=Michaelides, Demetrios |year=2003 |ISBN=92-9077-179-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detachment breaks the intrinsic link between wall paintings and architecture; causes irreversible physical damage to the texture, topography, and tone of the painting; leaves a void in the stripped interior; with the introduction of new materials, typically leads to a cycle of retreatment; and has resulted in "many transfers in terrible condition that serve as examples of serious, albeit unintentional, maltreatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reversibility - Does it Exist? |editor1=Oddy, Andrew |editor1-link=William Andrew Oddy |editor2=Carroll, Sara |publisher=[[British Museum Press#British Museum Press|British Museum Press]] |year=1999 |ISBN=0-86159-135-6 |chapter=Aspects of reversibility in transferred paintings |pages=63–71 (p. 65 for quote) |author=Brajer, Isabelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts''''' was a [[literary magazine]] founded in 1962 by the poet [[Ed Sanders]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Laura Martisiute|title=10 Cool Magazines From The Past You’ll Want To Get Your Hands On|url=http://listverse.com/2015/12/28/10-cool-magazines-from-the-past-youll-want-to-get-your-hands-on/|accessdate=December 9, 2016|work=Listverse|date=December 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on the [[Lower East Side]] of New York City. Sanders later co-founded the musical group [[The Fugs]]. Sanders produced thirteen issues of ''Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts'' from 1962 to 1965.&lt;ref name="Haralson2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric L. Haralson|title=Encyclopedia of American Poetry: The Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noCrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA402|accessdate=December 4, 2015|date=January 21, 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-76322-2|page=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The credo for the magazine, originated by Sanders, was ''I'll print anything.'' Its first issue contained the following dedication: "Dedicated to [[Pacifism]], [[Unilateral disarmament|Unilateral Disarmament]], [[National security|National Defense]] thru [[Nonviolent resistance|Nonviolent Resistence]] [sic], Multilateral Indiscriminate Apertural Conjugation, [[Anarchism]], [[World Federalism]], [[Civil Disobedience]], Obstructers &amp; Submarine Boarders, and All Those [[Groping|Groped]] by [[J. Edgar Hoover]] in the Silent Halls of Congress."&lt;ref name="no1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cdn.realitystudio.org/images/bibliographic_bunker/fuck_you/fuck-you-press-pdfs/fuck-you.01.pdf|title=Fuck You/A Magazine of the Arts|number=1|accessdate=June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts'' was produced on a [[mimeograph]] and printed on multi-colored [[construction paper]].

==Legacy==
''Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts'' was a core publication in the [[Mimeo Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realitystudio.org/bibliographic-bunker/fuck-you-press-archive/ |title=RealityStudio website: Fuck You Press Archive|work=Reality Studio|accessdate=June 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was dedicated to [[free expression]], and especially defying the [[taboo]]s around sex and drugs, advocating free love [[promiscuity]] and the use of [[psychedelics]] long before those were picked up by the more widespread countercultural movements of the late Sixties. Ed Sanders and his collaborators served as a bridge between the [[Beat generation]] of the Fifties and the later [[Hippie]] [[counterculture]] of the mid Sixties.

'''Globi''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[cartoon character]] occasionally referred to as Switzerland's [[Mickey Mouse]].&lt;ref name="swissinfo1"&gt;{{cite web|author=- 15:29 |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/archive/Swiss_Mickey_Mouse_turns_75.html?cid=666192 |title=Globi the parrot, the Swiss "Mickey Mouse", turns 75 |publisher=swissinfo.ch |date=2007-07-23 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is pictured as an anthropomorphic blue parrot with a yellow beak wearing a black [[beret]] and a pair of red and black checkered trousers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=- 13:22 |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/archive/Museum_honours_popular_parrot.html?cid=666120 |title=Museum honours popular parrot |publisher=swissinfo.ch |date=2003-02-01 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was created by the Swiss cartoonist [[Robert Lips]], as an advertising character for the Swiss department store [[Globus (company)|Globus]] in 1932 for the company's 25th anniversary. He was originally planned to be called "Kimbukku", but later renamed Globi after the local [[Swiss German|Basel German]] ''(Baseldytsch)'' dialect word for the department store that created him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=- 20:03 |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/culture/Globi_starts_going_global.html?cid=31248 |title=Popular children's cartoon character Globi appears in English translation for the first time. |publisher=swissinfo.ch |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
He initially appeared in a cartoon strip called "Der Globi", and later appeared in a cartoon picture-book form called "Globi's World Voyage" in 1935.  By 1944, the character gained so much popularity that Globus created a separate company for it, and in 1948 Globi had sold over one million picture books. He was introduced in other markets such as the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Brazil]], but did not do as well. In the 1970s, he was accused of being [[sexist]], [[racist]], and promoting violence, which was based on the attitudes of the 1940s and 1950s, but the articles in question were then withdrawn and revised.&lt;ref name="swissinfo1"/&gt;

==Present==
He is one of the most popular characters in the German-Speaking part of Switzerland, with sales of over 9 million books. However, he stays mostly unknown in the French and Italian speaking parts of the country.&lt;ref name="rts"&gt;{{cite web|author=- 01:37 |url=https://www.rts.ch/play/radio/a-labordage/audio/les-autres-globi-star-en-suisse-alemanique-incognito-en-suisse-romande-?id=8466254&amp;station=a9e7621504c6959e35c3ecbe7f6bed0446cdf8da |title=Les Autres: Globi, star en Suisse alémanique incognito en Suisse romande. |publisher=RTS La Première |date=2017-03-30 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2003, a full-length film,  "Globi and the Stolen Shadows" was made which was based on him. It was directed by Robi Engler in [[Anime]]-style. Beside the books, there is a lot of Globi [[merchandise]], including [[cuddly toy]]s, crockery, cutlery, clocks, school equipment, card games, food. From December 2008, the Swiss town of [[Engelberg]] hosts a Globi [[theme park]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6647">[[Image:Gold-Hut klein-cm.png|thumb|The Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch]]
The '''Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch''' ({{lang-de|Goldblechkegel von Ezelsdorf Buch}}) is a [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artefact]] discovered in 1953 between the villages of [[Burgthann|Ezelsdorf]] ([[Middle Franconia]]) and [[Postbauer-Heng|Buch]] ([[Upper Palatinate]]) in [[Southern Germany]]. A tall (88&amp;nbsp;cm), cone-shaped object made of thin sheet gold, it is seen as belonging to a group of artifacts referred to as [[Bronze Age]] [[Golden hats]]. It was presumably worn by special functionaries on ceremonial occasions.

== Cultural Context and date ==
The Ezelsdorf-Buch cone is one of four such known items. Two of them were discovered in Southern Germany, one in the west of [[France]], and one is without provenance, believed to have been found in Switzerland or Germany. It dates to ''circa'' 1,000 to 900 BC.

Parallels have been drawn between the golden 'hats' and depictions found on the [[The King's Grave|Kivik slabs]] and on objects from the Stockhult hoard discovered in [[Scandinavia]].

The 'hat', like its counterparts, is assumed to have served as a religious insignia for the deities or priests of a sun-cult common in Bronze Age Europe. The hats are also suggested to have served [[Golden hats#Calendars|calendrical functions]].

== Provenance and find history ==
The Ezelsdorf-Buch Cone was discovered accidentally during the removal of tree-stumps in 1953. However, it was not recognised as an [[archaeology|archaeological find]] immediately, and its top was torn and broken by digging tools, probably weakening or destroying the structure of the whole object. It is also possible that the object had been damaged previously or that it had fully or partially collapsed during burial. It was probably originally buried in an upright position, with its top relatively near ground level, as were its [[Berlin Gold Hat|Berlin]] and [[Golden Hat of Schifferstadt|Schifferstadt]] counterparts. After recovery, the cone was mutilated and torn into small scraps of sheet gold. Although it could be mostly reconstructed at an early stage, it was only in the 1990s that the find was understood as belonging to the group of "[[golden hats]]".

== Description ==
[[Image:EzelsdorfBuch Golden Hat schematic.jpg|thumb|Schematic depiction of the Ezelsdorf Cone's decorative scheme]]
Including the part now missing, the 'hat' would have weighed about 330 g. Like its counterparts, it was hammered from a single piece of gold, decorated in the [[repoussé]] technique with bands and rows of symbols, had a somewhat convex, cap-like, lower portion and was originally equipped with a 'brim', which was probably lost during its recovery. Like the Berlin example, it was reinforced by one or several bronze rings near the bottom.

The cone is now (in reconstructed form) 88.3&amp;nbsp;cm high, but was probably somewhat shorter, at 72&amp;nbsp;cm or more.

Along its whole length, the object's surface is subdivided and decorated by horizontal bands or ribs and by rows of symbols. In total, there are 154 bands and symbol rows. The symbols are mostly circular bosses enclosed by up to seven concentric circles, as known from all other specimens. There are three sets of unusual special motifs: small horizontal ovals resembling eyes (row 92, also known from Schifferstadt and Berlin), small eight-spoked wheels (row 120) and miniature cones (rows 127 and 105). The latter are unique to the Ezesldorf-Buch cone and appear to represent the shape of a gold 'hat'. The tip of the cone is embellished with a ten-point star. The area where the cone joins the cap-like area is embellished with a 30&amp;nbsp;mm wide band of vertical grooving, as is the case on the Berlin example.

== Manufacture ==
The piece is hammered from a gold [[alloy]]; [[gold]] (88.3%), [[silver]] (11%), [[copper]] (0.59%) and [[tin]] (0.086%). Its average thickness is only 0.78&amp;nbsp;mm. The amount of gold used for making the object is equivalent to the size of a matchbox.

Twenty different decorative punches, a comb, and six stamp-wheels or cylindrical stamps were used to apply the patterns. For a more detailed discussion of the cone's manufacture, see [[Golden hats#Manufacture|here]].

== Present location ==
The Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch is on display in the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]], [[Nuremberg]].

A '''handicraft''', sometimes more precisely expressed as '''artisanal handicraft''' or '''handmade''', is any of a wide variety of types of work where useful and decorative objects are made completely by hand or by using only simple tools. It is a traditional main sector of [[craft]], and applies to a wide range of creative and [[design]] activities that are related to making things with one's hands and skill, including work with textiles, moldable and rigid materials, paper, plant fibers, etc. One of the world's oldest handicraft is [[Dhokra]]; this is a sort of metal casting that has been used in India for over 4,000 years and is still used. Usually the term is applied to traditional techniques of creating items (whether for personal use or as products) that are both practical and aesthetic.Handicraft industries are those that produces things with hands to meet the needs of the people in their locality.Machines are not used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=On State Street, "Maker" Movement Arrives |url=http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/make_haven/id_46594 |date=April 30, 2012 |author=Thomas MacMillan |work=New Haven Independent |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gaiacollection.com/ |title=Gaia Handicraft |accessdate=November 23, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6mEttDude?url=http://www.gaiacollection.com/ |archivedate=November 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Invent To Learn|last=Martinez|first=Sylvia|publisher=Constructing Modern Knowledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0-9891511-0-8|location=Torrance, CA|pages=32–35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collective terms for handicrafts include '''artisanry''', '''handicrafting''', '''crafting''', and '''handicraftsmanship'''.
The term '''arts and crafts''' is also applied, especially in the United States and mostly to hobbyists' and children's output rather than items crafted for daily use, but this distinction is not formal, and the term is easily confused with the [[Arts and Crafts]] design movement, which is in fact as practical as it is aesthetic.

Handicrafting has its roots in the [[rural crafts]]—the material-goods necessities—of ancient civilizations, and many specific crafts have been practiced for centuries, while others are modern inventions, or popularizations of crafts which were originally practiced in a limited geographic area.

Many handicrafters use natural, even entirely indigenous, materials while others may prefer modern, non-traditional materials, and even [[Upcycling|upcycle]] industrial materials. The individual [[artisan]]ship of a handicrafted item is the paramount criterion; those made by [[mass production]] or machines are not handicraft goods.

Seen as developing the skills and creative interests of students, generally and sometimes towards a particular craft or trade, handicrafts are often integrated into educational systems, both informally and formally.  Most crafts require the development of skill and the application of patience, but can be learned by virtually anyone.

Like [[folk art]], handicraft output often has cultural and/or religious significance, and increasingly may have a political message as well, as in [[craftivism]]. Many crafts become very popular for brief periods of time (a few months, or a few years), spreading rapidly among the crafting population as everyone emulates the first examples, then their popularity wanes until a later resurgence.

==The Arts and Crafts movement in the West==
{{Main|Arts and Crafts}}
The [[Arts and Crafts]] movement originated as a late 19th-century design reform and social movement principally in Europe, North America and Australia, and continues today. Its proponents are motivated by the ideals of movement founders such as [[William Morris]] and [[John Ruskin]], who proposed that in pre-industrial societies, such as the European [[Middle Ages]], people had achieved [[Catharsis|fulfillment]] through the creative process of handicrafts. This was held up in contrast to what was perceived to be the alienating effects of industrial labor.
[[File:WPA Crafts Class.gif|thumb|left|Works Progress Administration, Crafts Class, 1935.]]
These activities were called ''[[craft]]s'' because originally many of them were professions under the [[guild]] system. Adolescents were apprenticed to a master craftsman, and refined their skills over a period of years in exchange for low wages. By the time their training was complete, they were well equipped to set up in trade for themselves, earning their living with the skill that could be traded directly within the community, often for goods and services. The [[Industrial Revolution]] and the increasing mechanisation of production processes gradually reduced or eliminated many of the roles professional craftspeople played, and today many handicrafts are increasingly seen, especially when no longer the mainstay of a [[Tradesman|formal vocational trade]], as a form of [[hobby]], [[folk art]] and sometimes even [[fine art]].

The term ''handicrafts'' can also refer to the products themselves of such artisanal efforts, that require specialized knowledge, may be highly technical in their execution, require specialized equipment and/or facilities to produce, involve [[manual labor]] or a [[blue-collar]] work ethic, are accessible to the general public, and are constructed from materials with histories that exceed the boundaries of Western "fine art" tradition, such as [[ceramic]]s, [[glass]], [[textiles]], [[metal]] and [[wood]].  These products are produced within a specific [[community of practice]], and while they mostly differ from the products produced within the communities of art and design, the boundaries often overlap, resulting in hybrid objects.  Additionally, as the interpretation and validation of art is frequently a matter of context, an audience may perceive handicrafted objects as art objects when these objects are viewed within an art context, such as in a museum or in a position of prominence in one's home.

==In modern education==
[[File:Buell Childrens Museum Art Room by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|At the [[Buell Children's Museum]] in [[Pueblo, Colorado]], children and their guardians partake in "arts and crafts" (i.e. handicrafts).]]
Simple "arts and crafts" projects are a common elementary and middle school activity in both mainstream and alternative education systems around the world.

In some of the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, more advanced handicrafts form part of the formal, compulsory school curriculum, and are collectively referred to as ''[[sloyd|slöjd]]'' in Swedish, and ''käsityö'' or ''veisto'' in Finnish. Students learn how to work with mainly metal, textile and wood, not for professional training purposes as in American [[vocational education|vocational–technical schools]], but with the aim to develop children's and teens' practical skills, such as everyday problem-solving ability, tool use, and understanding of the materials that surround us for economical, cultural and environmental purposes.

Secondary schools and college and university art departments increasingly provide elective options for more handicraft-based arts, in addition to formal "[[fine art]]s", a distinction that continues to fade throughout the years, especially with the rise of [[studio craft]], i.e. the use of traditional handicrafting techniques by professional fine artists.

Many [[community center]]s and schools run evening or day classes and workshops, for adults and children, offering to teach basic craft skills in a short period of time.

'''''Hara-Kiri''''' was a monthly French [[satire|satirical]] magazine, first published in 1960, the precursor to ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]''. It was created by [[Georges Bernier]], [[François Cavanna|Cavanna]] and [[Fred Aristidès]]. A weekly counterpart, '''''Hara-Kiri Hebdo''''', was first published in 1969.

Contributors included [[Melvin Van Peebles]], [[Jean-Marc Reiser|Reiser]], [[Roland Topor]], [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]], [[Georges Wolinski|Wolinski]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Gébé|fr}}, [[Cabu]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Delfeil de Ton|fr}}, [[Jean-Claude Fournier|Fournier]], [[Jean-Pierre Bouyxou]] and [[Willem (cartoonist)|Willem]]. In 1966 it published ''[[The Adventures of Jodelle|Les Aventures de Jodelle]]'', drawn by [[Guy Peellaert]] 

Hara-Kiri editions, subtitled "''Journal bête et méchant''" ("Stupid and nasty newspaper"), were constantly aiming at established powers, be they political parties or institutions like the Church or the State. In 1961 and 1966 the monthly magazine was temporarily banned by the French government.

==''Hara-Kiri Hebdo'' becomes ''Charlie Hebdo''==
In November 1970, following the death of [[Charles de Gaulle]] at his home in [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises]], the weekly ''Hara-Kiri Hebdo'' bore the headline ''« Bal tragique à Colombey : 1 mort »'' (Eng: "Tragic ball in [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises|Colombey]]: 1 death").

By way of contradistinction, the choice of the title refers to the far greater loss of life the same month: a [[Club Cinq-Sept fire|fire at a discothèque]] in which 146 people died.  The government felt this editorial choice was an offence of [[lèse-majesté]] against the deceased President and its then minister of the interior [[Raymond Marcellin]] ordered an immediate and permanent ban on publicity and on sale to minors.

''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' was started immediately afterwards. Charlie in the title refers to General de Gaulle (said [[Georges Wolinski]]); but it was also the name of another magazine from Éditions du Square ''[[Charlie Mensuel]]'', named after the character [[Charlie Brown]] from [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]''.

'''''Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle''''' is a 2004 American [[stoner film|stoner]] [[comedy film]] and the first installment of the [[Harold &amp; Kumar|''Harold &amp; Kumar'' series]]. The film was written by [[Jon Hurwitz]] and [[Hayden Schlossberg]], and directed by [[Danny Leiner]].

The story follows Harold Lee ([[John Cho]]) and Kumar Patel ([[Kal Penn]]) as they decide to go to the fast food chain [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] after smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], but end up on a series of comical misadventures along the way.

The film also features [[Fred Willard]], [[Paula Garcés]], [[Anthony Anderson]], Dan Bochart, [[Ethan Embry]], [[Jamie Kennedy]], [[Bobby Lee]], [[Christopher Meloni]], [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Shaun Majumder]], [[David Krumholtz]], [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]], [[Malin Åkerman]], and [[Neil Patrick Harris]], who plays a fictionalized version of himself.

==Plot==
Investment banker Harold Lee is persuaded by his colleagues to do their work while they leave for the weekend. Meanwhile, Kumar Patel attends a medical school interview, but intentionally botches it to prevent getting accepted. Harold is attracted to his neighbor, Maria, but is unable to admit his feelings. After smoking marijuana with Kumar, and seeing an advertisement for [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]], the pair decide to get hamburgers to satisfy their hunger. After traveling to the nearest White Castle in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], they find it replaced by "Burger Shack" but learn of another White Castle in [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey|Cherry Hill]].

Kumar suggests stopping at [[Princeton University]] to buy more marijuana. Kumar buys marijuana from one of the students and they are discovered by campus security and forced to flee, losing their marijuana after it falls in the toilet. Harold and Kumar resume their drive, and when Kumar pulls over to urinate, a raccoon gets in the car and bites Harold. Kumar takes Harold to a hospital where Kumar's father and older brother work. Kumar steals ID badges to obtain [[medical cannabis|medical marijuana]], but after being mistaken for his brother, Kumar is forced to perform surgery on a gunshot victim and, after the surgery, the patient tells them how to reach White Castle.

Kumar spots Maria at a movie theatre, and decides to get her attention so Harold can talk to her, but Harold panics and crashes the car. They are rescued by Freakshow, a tow-truck driver, who takes them to his house to repair their car. Harold and Kumar are propositioned by Freakshow's surprisingly alluring wife, but after Freakshow suggests a [[foursome (group sex)|foursome]], Harold and Kumar flee in disgust. Kumar picks up a hitchhiker, [[Neil Patrick Harris]], who is high on [[MDMA|ecstasy]]. Harold and Kumar go into a convenience store to get directions and Harris drives away in their car. The duo are then harassed by a racist police officer for jaywalking. Harold attempts to punch Kumar for antagonizing the officer, but ends up punching the officer instead, resulting in his arrest.

Kumar fakes a 911 call to distract the police and breaks into the station to free Harold. After Harold and Kumar flee the pair encounters an escaped [[cheetah]]. After smoking marijuana with it, they decide to ride it to white castle, but Harold goes unconscious after hitting his head on a branch. After encountering a group of extreme sports punks who have been harassing the pair, Harold and Kumar steal their truck. A police officer spots the speeding truck and chases them. They are trapped when they reach the edge of a cliff. Spotting the White Castle below, Harold and Kumar use a [[hang glider]] from the truck to reach their destination. The pair place their orders but are disheartened to find they have no money. Harris suddenly appears, and pays for their meal as an apology for stealing their car.

Kumar realizes he wants to be a doctor, but is afraid of conforming to the stereotype of Indians becoming doctors. Harold then notices his co-workers pull up with two women and gets angry at them because they said they had to work with clients but were actually out partying. He tells them off and threatens to get them fired and humiliated if it happens again. After returning to their apartment they encounter Maria. Harold professes his feelings for her and they kiss. She informs Harold that she is leaving for Amsterdam but will return in ten days. Kumar convinces Harold to go with him to Amsterdam to pursue Maria, reminding him that marijuana is legal in the [[Netherlands]].

==Production==
While living in Los Angeles, screenwriters Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg decided to write a low-budget stoner film and base the main characters on their high school friends from [[Randolph High School (New Jersey)|Randolph High School]]. They based the character of Harold on their real-life friend Harold Lee. Hurwitz got the idea to base the film around White Castle from his own experience craving White Castle burgers when he lived in Pennsylvania for several years. At the time, Pennsylvania did not have any White Castle locations and Hurwitz had to have family members bring him frozen White Castle burgers from New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vespe|first1=Eric|title=Quint interviews HAROLD AND KUMAR writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg about Doogie and Battlesh!ts!!!|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/17996|publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=July 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmakers received permission from White Castle in 2002 to use the chain's name in the film.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cebrznynski|first1=Greg|title=White Castle on Promotional Journey with "Harold and Kumar"|work=Nation's Restaurant News|date=July 26, 2004|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scene that depicted a White Castle being closed was changed at the request of the company's director of marketing. The film was also supposed to feature a hunt for [[Krispy Kreme]] donuts, but the food was changed to hotdogs when Krispy Kreme refused to allow the film to use their name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=White Castle rolls dice with movie role|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-07-29/news/0407300004_1_white-castle-harold-and-kumar-movie|work=The Chicago Tribune|date=July 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
===Casting===
Hurwitz and Schlossberg included a role for Neil Patrick Harris as himself in the script without asking him first. Harris liked the script and agreed to appear in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Charaipotra|first1=Sona|title=Harold &amp; Kumar's Neil Patrick Harris|work=People|issue=Vol. 62 Issue 7|date=August 16, 2004|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During casting, both Kal Penn and actor [[Sendhil Ramamurthy]] were being considered for the role of Kumar. After auditioning seven times, Penn eventually won the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=https://desigeekgirls.libsyn.com/interview-sendhil-ramamurthy-from-nbcs-reverie |title= Interview: Sendhil Ramamurthy from NBC's "Reverie" |website=Desi Geek Girls |publisher= |host= Preeti Chhibber and Swapna Krishna |date= May 23, 2008 |time= 20:50 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During filming, Penn ate veggie burgers as he is a vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kal Penn: Hungry for Sucess|work=Teen Tribute|date=June 1, 2004|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==

===Marketing===
In the 11 days before the film's release, New Line Cinema turned a parking lot on [[Sunset Strip]] into a temporary White Castle. The restaurant served 40,000 burgers to patrons, including [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Farah Fawcett]] and [[Jay Leno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rushfield|first1=Richard|title=Farah Goes to White Castle|work=Variety|issue=Vol. 395|date=August 10, 2004|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White Castle launched several promotions in tandem with the film's release. The restaurant chain featured beverage cups with pictures of Harold and Kumar. They also provided free hamburgers to moviegoers attending the film's premiere.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; Cho and Penn were inducted into the company's White Castle Cravers Hall of Fame in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kim|first1=Hank|title=White Castle lands title role in feature|work=Advertising Age|issue=Vol. 75, Issue 22|date=May 31, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
In its opening weekend, the film grossed $5,480,378 in 2135 theatres in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. In total it had a worldwide gross of $23,936,908.&lt;ref name="BOM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=haroldandkumar.htm |title=Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle (2004) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The film was positively received by critics, with a 74% rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 147 reviews; the consensus states "The likable leads and subversion of racial stereotypes elevate Harold and Kumar above the typical stoner comedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/harold_and_kumar_go_to_white_castle/|title=Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haroldandkumar.com/ |title=A Very Harold &amp; Kumar Christmas - WarnerBros.com - Movies |publisher=Haroldandkumar.com |date=2011-11-04 |accessdate=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote "One secret of fiction is the creation of unique characters who are precisely defined. The secret of comedy is the same, with the difference being that the characters must be obsessed with unwholesome but understandable human desires."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harold and Kumar:Go to White Castle|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/harold-and-kumar-go-to-white-castle-2004|publisher=Roger Ebert.com|accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5198">[[File:CasaOctaviusQartiogarden.jpg|thumb|The house's garden]]
'''The House of Loreius Tiburtinus''' (also called the '''House of Octavius Quartio''') is renowned for its meticulous and well-preserved artwork as well as its large gardens. It is located in the Roman city of [[Pompeii]]. It, along with the rest of Pompeii was preserved by the volcanic eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] on October A 24, 79 AD.

== History ==
[[Image:Map showing the main streets of Pompeii.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Pompeii's layout highlighting main streets. Via Dell'Abbondanza is in green]]
The House of Loreius Tiburtinus was excavated between the years 1916  and 1921  by V. Spinazzola. It can be found on the Via Dell'Abbondanza (or street of abundance), one of the most prosperous streets in Pompeii.  There is considerable debate over the naming of this particular house.&lt;ref name="Tronchin"&gt;Tronchin, Francesca C. "An Eclectic Locus Artis: the Casa Di Octavius Quartio At Pompeii." Diss. Boston Univ., 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Its original name of Loreius Tiburtinus was derived from electoral advertisements of sorts etched in the outer façade, some saying "Vote for Loreius" and others "Vote for Tiburtinus."  In fact, the last known owner of the house was a man named Octavius Quartio, whose bronze seal was found inside the house during excavation.&lt;ref name="Nappo"&gt;Nappo, Salvatore. Pompeii: Guide to the Lost City. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1988. 32-33, 41-45, 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians choose to refer to this house as the House of Octavius Quartio.

[[Image:Pompeji Casa Di Octavio Quartio Wall.jpg|thumb|left|Painting on south wall of oecus]]
Pompeii is organized into a series of ''[[insulae]]'' or rectangular blocks of buildings made up of a combination of shops and residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/5D*.html|title=LacusCurtius • Strabo's Geography — Book V Chapter 4|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Loreius Tiburtinus occupies almost its entire ''insula'' with a combination of its residential area and its garden. Also included in the ''insula'' were two ''cauponae'' (Inns where locals could receive a hot meal). Its location was convenient to both the palaestra and the [[Amphitheatre of Pompeii|amphitheatre]], and the section of Via Dell'Abbondanza it occupied was closed off to cart traffic in ancient times.&lt;ref name="Nappo"/&gt;

== Organization ==
The inside of the house is fairly uniform in its organization, and matches the standard of much of the [[Roman architecture]] at the time. Unfortunately some of the house's original integrity was compromised before the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in the [[62 Pompeii earthquake|earthquake of 62 AD]].&lt;ref name="Tronchin"/&gt;

The entryway or anteroom leads into the [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], a large open room with an ''[[impluvium]]'' in the center. This basin collected rainwater through a hole in the roof to be used by the patrons of the house. On the far side of the atrium is a modest [[peristyle]] where the original [[tablinum]] (office) once was. The lack of a functional tablinum is evidence of the earthquake's toll on the house's infrastructure. There are several [[oecus|oeci]] off the main atrium used as receiving rooms with various art displayed in each room. In the House of Loreius Tiburtinus, one specific oecus that borders the ''viridarium'' or indoor garden functioned as a ''[[triclinium]]'' or dining area where guests could be entertained. This room was particularly well decorated to please the many guests that must have passed through. Bordering the garden is a summer ''triclinium'' where diners could recline during the warmer months.&lt;ref name="Nappo"/&gt;

==Gardens==
[[Image:Pyrthis.jpg|thumb|Pyramus and Thisbe in the house of Loreius Tiburtinus]]
The House of Loreius Tiburtinus is particularly well known for its extensive gardens and outdoor ornamentation. Beyond the summer triclinium there was a specific arrangement of two ''Euripi'', a decorative type of fountain. These fountains were the centerpiece for many [[fresco]]es and statuettes. The upper ''Epirus''  has a strong significance to the excavated city of Pompeii because its decorative frescoes are the source of the only known artist's signature: "Lucius pinxit" or "Painted by Lucius."&lt;ref name="Nappo"/&gt; These frescoes portray the myths of [[narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]]  on one side of the fountain and [[Pyramus and Thisbe]] on the other. The other lower Euripus is a fountain that spans the long garden which holds numerous types of foliage including various fruit trees. All of these fountains operate using a technology called castellum plumbeum, a fairly complex water pressure system which functioned with the local water towers, providing to several locations.

'''Hugh Hope''' (1782–1822) was a [[civil servant]] for the [[East India Company]] and the third son of [[Sir Archibald Hope, 9th Baronet]] [[Hope Baronets#Hope baronets, of Craighall (1628)|Hope of Craighall]].  A portrait of Hugh Hope, painted by [[Sir Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823), currently hangs in [[The Cleveland Museum of Art]].

==Painting by Raeburn==
Commissioned by the subject's family, Sir Henry Raeburn painted his portrait of Hugh Hope around 1810.&lt;ref name="The Cleveland Museum of Art" /&gt;

An 1889 Scottish Art Review&lt;ref name="Scottish Art Review - Pinkie House" /&gt; described the painting as follows:

:''To our left of the portrait of Sir Thomas Hope hangs another admirable family picture, which indeed may rank as the most accomplished piece of art that Pinkie contains.  This is a bust portrait of Hugh Hope (b. 1782, d. 1822), of the East India Company's Service, second son of the ninth Baronet, by his second wife.  It is the work of Raeburn, and a masterly example of that painter, showing - in every touch that expresses the fair hair, the blue eyes, the full, fresh-coloured face and in the details of the crisp white ruffles, the dark brown coat, the yellow vest - that easy power of swift, unlaboured, expressive brush-work, for which Sir Henry is unrivalled among Scottish painters.''

The painting hung for over a hundred years at [[Pinkie House]],&lt;ref name="Scottish Art Review - Pinkie House"&gt;{{cite web|author1=E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10799">'''Hypertext fiction''' is a genre of [[electronic literature]], characterized by the use of [[hypertext]] links that provide a new context for non-linearity in literature and reader interaction. The reader typically chooses links to move from one node of text to the next, and in this fashion arranges a story from a deeper pool of potential stories.  Its spirit can also be seen in [[interactive fiction]].

The term can also be used to describe traditionally-published books in which a [[nonlinear narrative]] and interactive narrative is achieved through internal references. [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922), [[Enrique Jardiel Poncela]]'s ''[[La Tournée de Dios]]'' (1932), [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' ''[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]'' (1941), [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]'' (1962), [[Julio Cortázar]]'s ''[[Rayuela]]'' (1963; translated as ''Hopscotch''), and [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''[[The Castle of Crossed Destinies]]'' (1973) are early examples predating the word "[[Hypertext#History|hypertext]]", while a common pop-culture example is the ''[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]'' series in [[young adult fiction]] and other similar [[gamebook]]s. ''[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]'' (1941) is both a hypertext story and is sometimes used as a description of having different possible paths.

== Definitions ==
There is little consensus on the definition of hypertext literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yellowlees |first=Jane Douglas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ReMjJYdo2n0C&amp;pg=PA3 |page=3 |title=The End of Books—or Books Without End?: Reading Interactive Narratives |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2001 |isbn=0472088467}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similar term cybertext is often used interchangeably with hypertext.&lt;ref&gt;Aarseth, Espen.1997. ''ergodic Literature''. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press. http://www.hf.uib.no/cybertext/Ergodic.html&lt;/ref&gt; In hypertext fiction, the reader assumes a significant role in the creation of the narrative. Each user obtains a different outcome based on the choices they make. Cybertexts may be equated to the transition between a [[linear]] piece of literature, such as a [[novel]], and a [[game]]. In a novel the reader has no choice, the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and the characters are all chosen by the author, there is no 'user,' just a 'reader,' this is important because it entails that the person working their way through the novel is not an active participant. In a game, the person makes decisions and decides what actions to take, what punches to punch, or when to jump.

To [[Espen Aarseth]], cybertext is not a [[genre]] in itself; in order to classify traditions, [[literary genres]] and [[aesthetic value]], [[Plain text|texts]] should be examined at a more local level.&lt;ref&gt;Bolter, Jay David, Degrees of Freedom, retrieved from http://www.uv.es/~fores/programa/bolter_freedom.html&lt;/ref&gt;  To Aarseth, hypertext fiction is a kind of '''[[ergodic literature]]''':

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ergodic literature, nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text. If ergodic literature is to make sense as a concept, there must also be nonergodic literature, where the effort to traverse the text is trivial, with no [[wikt/extranoematic|extranoematic]] responsibilities placed on the reader except (for example) eye movement and the periodic or arbitrary turning of pages. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Aarseth, the process of reading immersive narrative, in contrast, involves "trivial" effort, that is, merely moving one's eyes along lines of text and turning pages; the text does not resist the reader.

== History ==

The first hypertext fictions were published prior to the development of the [[World Wide Web]], using software such as [[Storyspace]] and [[HyperCard]]. Noted pioneers in the field are [[Judy Malloy]] and [[Michael Joyce (writer)|Michael Joyce]]. 

[[Douglas Anthony Cooper|Douglas Cooper]]'s ''[[Delirium (Cooper novel)|Delirium]]'' (1994) was the first novel serialized on the World Wide Web; it permitted navigation between four parallel story strands. On June 21, 1996, Bobby Rabyd (aka [[Robert Arellano]]) published the World Wide Web's first interactive novel,&lt;ref&gt;Ciccarello, Lisa. [http://www.pifmagazine.com/2000/01/swiveling-my-hipsthrough-the-interbunk "Swiveling My Hips through the Interbunk (And Having a Great Time, Too)"]. Pif Magazine: January, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sunshine 69'', with navigable maps of settings, a nonlinear calendar of scenes, and a character "suitcase" enabling readers to try on nine different points of view. Shortly thereafter, in 1997, [[Mark Amerika]] released ''GRAMMATRON'', a multi-linear work that was eventually exhibited in art galleries.  In 2000, it was included in the [[Whitney Museum|Whitney Biennial of American Art]].&lt;ref name="nytwhitneylist"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/120899whitney-list.html Artists Selected for the 2000 Whitney Biennial]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, women and feminist artists took advantage of hypertext and produced dozens of works. [[Linda Dement]]’s ''Cyberflesh Girlmonster'' a hypertext CD-ROM that incorporates images of women’s body parts and remixes them to create new monstrous yet beautiful shapes. Dr. Caitlin Fisher’s  hypertext novella “‘These Waves of Girls“ is set in three time periods of the protagonist exploring polymorphous perversity enacted in her queer identity through memory. The story is written as a reflection diary of the interconnected memories of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. It consists of an associated multi-modal collection of nodes includes linked text, still and moving images, manipulable images, animations, and sound clips. It won the [[Electronic Literature Organization]] award.

Some other web examples of hypertext fiction include Adrienne Eisen's ''Six Sex Scenes'' (1995),
Stuart Moulthrop's ''Hegirascope'' (1995, 1997), ''The Unknown'' (which won the trAce(Alt X award in 1998), ''The Company Therapist'' (1996-1999) (which won Net Magazine's "Entertainment Site of the Year"), and Caitlin Fisher's ''These Waves of Girls'' (2001) (which won the ELO award for fiction in 2001). More recent works include Stephen Marche's "Lucy Hardin's Missing Period" (2010)&lt;ref&gt;http://walrusmagazine.com/lucyhardin/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul LaFarge|Paul La Farge’s]] * ''Luminous Airplanes''  (2011).

The internationally oriented, but US based, [[Electronic Literature Organization]] (ELO) was founded in 1999 to promote the creation and enjoyment of electronic literature. Other organisations for the promotion of electronic literature include trAce Online Writing Community, a British organisation, started in 1995, that has fostered electronic literature in the UK, Dichtung Digital, a journal of criticism of electronic literature in English and German, and ELINOR, a network for electronic literature in the Nordic countries, which provides a directory of Nordic electronic literature. The Electronic Literature Directory lists many works of electronic literature in English and other languages.

== Characteristics ==
Hypertext fiction is characterized by networked nodes of text making up a fictional story. There are often several options in each node that directs where the reader can go next. Unlike traditional fiction, the reader is not constrained by reading the fiction from start to end, depending on the choices they make. In this sense, it is similar to an encyclopaedia, with the reader reading a node and then choosing a link to follow. While this can be done more easily on paper, it is quite a different experience on a screen. The reader can be thrown into unpredictable loops because not all of the links are explained by their title. The fiction can contain text, quotes, and images.

There are different forms that hypertext fiction can take. These forms are axial, arborescent, and networked. Axial hypertext fictions have a central story line with links that branch off and return to the central storyline. Arborescent fictions branch into mutually exclusive story lines, and networked fictions have multiple starting points and do not always have a set ending. A single work of hypertext fiction can have a mixture of these three forms.

== Criticism ==
In 2013, [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] published an article to describe why hypertext fiction did not become popular; it was because the non-linear stories are difficult to write, since each section of the work would need to introduce characters or concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2013/04/hypertext/ Why No One Clicked on the Great Hypertext Story] March 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, hypertext is widely used to tell linear stories on the Internet by using hypertext links to other articles or arguments that are written by different people.

'''Ignaz Matausch''' (September 1, 1859 – December 14, 1915) was an Austrian-American artist and [[entomology|entomologist]] known for his models of insects and other invertebrates at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. Born in [[Budweis]], he emigrated to the United States in 1892 and resided in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], until 1904, when he became a member of the modeling staff of the American Museum. He was known for his realistic large-scale models including the flea, house fly, and spider. As an entomologist he focused on [[treehopper]]s (Membracidae), authoring eight papers on their biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ignaz Matausch|first=Roy W.|last=Miner|journal=Journal of the New York Entomological Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHMVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA155|year=1916|pages=155–157|volume=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Huge Model of the Flea|journal=Scientific American|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=isoxAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA260-IA3|year=1914|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Current Notes|journal=Journal of Economic Entomology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQn0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA515|year=1916|volume=9|page=515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was educated at the [[City of London School]]. In 1890 he entered the [[Royal Academy School]], where he gained a free medal, and afterward a scholarship in the [[Institution of British Artists]]. He showed his interest in [[Jewish]] matters by his drawings ''A Difficult Passage in the [[Talmud]]'' and ''The Blessing of Sabbath Lights,'' as well as by his ''Early Morning Prayer in the Synagogue.''

His older brother [[Jacob Snowman]] was a London medical doctor and prominent [[mohel]], who circumcised [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] and possibly other members of the [[British Royal Family]]. His younger brother was [[Emanuel Snowman]], the jeweller, politician and community leader.&lt;ref name=Palgrave /&gt;

==Career==
In that year, 1897, he formed a group of English Jews known as the [[Maccabaeans]], including [[Israel Zangwill]] and [[Herbert Bentwich]], which undertook a pilgrimage to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the same year. &lt;ref&gt;Palestine Post, 17 March 1947, p. 3; ibid, 27 March 1949, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of his paintings, which were devoted mainly to portraits and domestic views, ''Children's Voices'' (1901) attracted a great deal of attention, and ''The Bride'' (1904) was very popular at the time. He also exhibited a study of ''Sardanapalus,'' as well as ''The Wailing-Place at Jerusalem'' and ''The Proclamation of Joseph as Ruler of Egypt.''

==Personal life==
Isaac Snowman was married to Pearl Alexander at the North London Synagogue on 13 September 1898. According to the report in ''[[The Times]]'' the marriage was never a happy one for the wife owing to the husband's exaggerated views on the subject of "wifely obedience." They lived in [[Algiers]] and [[Hampstead]], and after their son died they adopted a daughter.

In August 1907, Isaac Snowman left for Africa to execute a commission for the King of [[Dahomey]]. Subsequently Pearl filed for divorce on grounds of statutory desertion and adultery, which was granted in June 1909. &lt;ref&gt;The Times, 10 June 1909, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaac meantime continued to build his career. He was commissioned to paint portraits of King George V and Queen Mary, and it was said he was one of the Queen’s favourite artists. 21] Serious artworks enabled him to commission the first house on the now know Hocroft Estate to be built in Ranulf Road off Finchley Road. The house, now number 3, included dedicated artists work space: completed in about 1911, was for many years simply known as ‘The Studio’. Isaac sent five works to the R.A. from this 3 Ranulf Road. This area would have been well known to him, as it was just a few minutes walk from his old home in Fortune Green Road.

Isaac Snowman moved to [[Jerusalem]], where he had a studio over the [[Damascus Gate]]. In the riots that occurred in Jerusalem on 2 November 1921, Snowman encountered a mob and, while trying to make his way through with two friends, was stabbed. &lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Chronicle'', 28 November 1921, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
The outbreak of the [[Second World War]] found Snowman on a visit to England and his failing health prevented him from returning to his home in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine Post'', 17 March 1947, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaac Snowman died peacefully on 11 February 1947, and his funeral was held the following day at Willesden Cemetery. &lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 February 1947, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''King Prawn''' were a prominent band of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[ska punk]] scene during the 1990s and early 2000s. The band re-formed in 2012 without original bassist Babar Luck.

==History==
The band's formation was in [[London]], 1993.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The first major recording was ''First Offence'' three years later, produced by Martin "Ace" Kent of [[Skunk Anansie]].&lt;ref name=allmusic /&gt; They were nominated for a ''[[Kerrang!]]'' award in 1998 for Best New British Band, and in 2000 for Spirit of Independence.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} King Prawn toured regularly with a broad range of bands, varying from [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] to traditional and [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] [[ska]] bands. King Prawn songs often contained political lyrics that, along with the band's blending of genres, led to comparisons with bands such as [[Rage Against the Machine]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

King Prawn played their penultimate concert on 20 December 2003 at The Forum in [[Kentish Town]] which was recorded for their live DVD.&lt;ref name=dvd&gt;{{cite web|title=King Prawn - Live at the Forum [DVD]|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/King-Prawn-Live-Forum-DVD/dp/B0007YH6QK|publisher=amazon|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their final gig followed the next night at the Pitz club in Milton Keynes and members have since moved on to other projects: drummer Nikolai formed Left Step Band, an eclectic four piece Hip Hop groove machine; [[Babar Luck]] performs as a solo artist and also in a variety of collaborative projects including his rock band East End Trinity.

In the summer of 2007, [[Al Rumjen]] joined [[Asian Dub Foundation]] as their new vocalist. His first performance as a member of Asian Dub Foundation was at The Womad Festival in Singapore and his first album with the band was [[Punkara]].

In 2012, the band confirmed they will be playing festivals and a club tour afterward featuring a brass section but without [[Babar Luck]].

In 2013, the band played at Boomtown Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skiddle.com/festivals/boom-town/lineup.html|title=BoomTown Fair 2016 Line up|work=Skiddle.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Reading &amp; Leeds Festivals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readingfestival.com/line-up|title=Line up|work=Reading Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; and competed  a UK tour in November 2013.

The band released two tracks on the [[Bandcamp]] platform in 2014.&lt;ref name=done/&gt;

==Style==
King Prawn blend elements of [[punk rock|punk]], [[hardcore punk|hardcore]], [[Heavy metal music|metal]], [[ska]], [[dub music|dub]], [[reggae]], and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] into their music,&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/artist/king-prawn-mn0000093602/biography&lt;/ref&gt; which they dub ''wildstyle.''  In 2016, Jones stated that [[The Dead Kennedys]], [[Crass]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], and [[Bob Marley]] all influenced the band.&lt;ref&gt;https://thenorwichradical.com/2016/04/10/not-your-punk-an-interview-with-nikolai-jones-of-king-prawn/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laszlo Toth 1972.jpg|thumb|350px|Laszlo Toth is being removed from the ''Pietà'' on 21 May 1972]]
'''Laszlo Toth''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Tóth László''; 1 July 1938 – 11 September 2012) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born [[Australian]] [[geologist]]. He achieved worldwide notoriety when he vandalised [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'' statue on 21 May 1972. Toth was not charged with any [[criminal offence]] after the incident. He was hospitalized in [[Italy]] for two years. On his release, he was immediately [[deportation|deported]] to [[Australia]]. 

==Early life==
Toth was born in [[Pilisvörösvár]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], to a Roman Catholic family. After graduating in geology, in 1965 he moved to Australia. As his English was poor and his geology diploma was not recognized, Toth initially worked at a soap factory. In June 1971 he moved to Rome, Italy, knowing no [[Italian language|Italian]], and aiming to become recognized as [[Christ]]. He sent letters to [[Pope Paul VI]] and unsuccessfully attempted to meet him.&lt;ref name=Gamboni/&gt;

==Vandalism of ''Pietà''==
On 21 May 1972, at 33 years of age ([[Jesus]]'s traditional age at death), on the Feast of [[Pentecost]], Toth, wielding a [[geologist's hammer]] and shouting, "I am Jesus Christ — risen from the dead",&lt;ref name=Gamboni/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

With fifteen blows&lt;ref name="saint"/&gt; he removed Mary's arm at the elbow, knocked off a chunk of her nose, and chipped one of her eyelids. Toth was subdued by bystanders, including American sculptor [[Bob Cassilly]], who hit Toth several times before pulling him away from the ''Pietà''.&lt;ref name=stpr&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Schlafly |title=Remembering Bob Cassilly |url=http://www.stlpublicradio.org/programs/commentaries/commentary.php?cid=1310 |work=[[St. Louis Public Radio]] |publisher= |date=29 September 2011 |accessdate=23 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106095407/http://www.stlpublicradio.org/programs/commentaries/commentary.php?cid=1310 |archivedate=6 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In view of his apparent [[insanity defense|insanity]] Toth was never charged with the crime. On 29 January 1973, he was committed to an Italian [[psychiatric hospital]]. He was released on 9 February 1975, and was immediately deported to Australia, where he had studied prior to the attack; Australian authorities did not detain him.

==Literature and popular culture==
* Toth is the [[eponymous]] inspiration for books of letters by [[Don Novello]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 2003 | url = http://www.wnyc.org/story/130618-the-lazlo-letters/ | title = The Laszlo Letters (Don Novello interviewed by Bob Garfield) | work = On the Media | publisher = WNYC Radio | accessdate = 8 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Comic book artist [[Steve Ditko]] used Toth's actions as the central metaphor in his 1992 examination of issues concerning creation and destruction, ''Lazlo's Hammer'' (corrected to "Laszlo's Hammer" in subsequent reprints and revisions).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ditko-fever.com/lazloshammer.html Lazlo's Hammer].

*''[[Oz (comics)|Oz]]'' character Guillaume Tarrant is in part inspired by Toth.
* Australian cartoonist Michael Leunig published two Christmas cartoons in the ''Nation Review'' in 1975 under the ''nom-de-plume'' Laszlo Toth.

'''lebenslaute''' (motto: "classical music – political action") is an open [[direct action]] group that combines concerts of [[classical music]] with [[civil disobedience]], mostly by [[Open air concert|open-air]] protest concerts in unexpected locations. ''lebenslaute'' organizes several nonviolence performances per year on both national and regional levels in Germany.

In 2014, ''lebenslaute'' was awarded the renowned [[Peace Prize of Aachen]], Germany, together with the American organization [[Code Pink|Code Pink – Women for Peace]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aachener-friedenspreis.de/preistraeger/archiv/jahr-2014.html CodePink and Lebenslaute to be awarded the Peace Prize of Aachen] (de), ''aachener-friedenspreis.de'', 8 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It is awarded in the [[Aula Carolina]] in the city of [[Aachen]] each year on 1 September, the date on which [[International Day of Peace]] is celebrated in Germany, warningly commemorating the day on which [[Nazi Germany]] started [[European theatre of World War II|World War II]] by [[Invasion of Poland|invading Poland]] on 1 September 1939.

Since 1986, ''lebenslaute'' has been turning up in places where classical concerts are least expected, with group sizes between three and over one hundred and in professional black outfit. Locations are chosen in the eye of by-laws that would prohibit any activity of this kind in this spot, so political confrontation is consciously sought. Where possible, lebenslaute gives support to and cooperates with local civil disobedience groups. Direct action is deployed in places that are threatening to people or that design and manufacture objects used for killing, with the aim to protest against the official function of such organizations and locations in principle and in practise: any government agency where people are threatened, e.g. [[refugee]]s, any business of the [[arms industry]], any [[airport]] or [[prison]] used for [[deportation]], any [[nuclear power plant]], any [[military base]] and any other location that may have the aim of preparing for or conducting [[warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Translated and rephrased from http://www.lebenslaute.net, main page, August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Every lebenslaute activity is prepared in groups and decisions are taken accordance in [[Grassroots democracy]]. [[Nonviolence]] as a principle is followed inside the groups, too: None of the activists is asked to do more than they want to. In case of legal proceedings following suit, individuals can be sure to be shown solidarity by other group members and by the group itself in cooperation with allied organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Translated and rephrased from [http://www.lebenslaute.net?page_id=17 About us], ''lebenslaute.net'', August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The first political action by ''lebenslaute'' took place in 1986 when a huge classical orchestra blocked the entrance to the US military base of [[Pershing II]] [[ballistic missile]]s near the town of [[Mutlangen]] in a rural area of [[Baden-Württemberg]], South-Western Germany.

While some films criticize armed conflicts in a general sense, others focus on acts within a specific war, such as the use of poison gas or the [[Genocide|genocidal]] killing of civilians (e.g., ''[[Hotel Rwanda]]'', 2004). Some [[anti-war]] films such as ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964) use [[parody]] and [[black comedy]] to [[satire|satirize]] wars and conflicts. An anti-war film's goal is to show the physical and psychological destruction warfare causes to the soldiers and to innocent civilians.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

'''''Matin à Villeneuve''''', also known as '''''Villeneuve-l'Etang, le matin''''' and '''''From Waters Edge''''', is a painting created circa 1905 in the [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] tradition with a strong [[Naturalism (arts)|Naturalist]] component by the French artist [[Henri Biva]] (1848–1929). This work was photographed and reproduced as a black and white postcard published for the occasion of the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1906 in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924101988214/cu31924101988214_djvu.txt Loan exhibition of paintings owned by residents of Rochester: the Memorial Art Gallery (1914), University of Rochester, Book contributor: Cornell University Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Henri Biva, Matin à Villeneuve, Salon 1906, Vintage postcard.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Biva]], ca.1905, ''Matin à Villeneuve'', Salon 1906, original postcard, published in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delcampe.net/page/item/id,176011372,var,HBIVAMATIN-A-VILLENEUVESALON-1906cpa-9x14,language,E.html Henri Biva, Matin à Villeneuve, Salon 1906, Vintage postcard]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Matin à Villeneuve'' is an oil painting on canvas in a vertical format with dimensions 153.7 x 127&amp;nbsp;cm (60.5 by 50 in), signed ''Henri Biva'' (lower left).

This highly detailed work depicts a morning scene at the Villeneuve-l'étang park, located just outside Paris in the western suburb of Marnes-la-Coquette (Seine-et-Oise), France. The artist has chosen a quiet section of the park with a view facing towards the east. The greenery suggests the work was painted [[en plein air]] during the months of July or August, and possibly finished some time later in Biva's Parisian [[Artist studio|atelier]].

Unlike works of the [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionists]] or [[Fauvism|Fauves]], in vogue at the time, Biva has gone to great lengths to show even the most minute details of the scene, such as leaves and petals floating on the surface of the water; overlapping blades of grass; superimposed branches and leaves of varying size indicating distance from the observer; reflecting background trees in the rippling body of water; patches of raking sunlit shimmering seemingly at random throughout carefully selected sections of the composition.

This work of skillfully controlled artistry presents a dominant palette of green variously mixed and blended by the artist to form diverse tones, values and hues, contrasted only by the transpiercing light of the morning sky partly visible through the delicate foliage while bouncing off the surface of the shallows.

==Naturalism==
A trace of Biva's meticulous and rigorous professors at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris—Léon Tanzi (1846-1913), an esteemed Realist painter and Alexandre Nozal (1852-1929) a respected landscape artist—can be contemplated in Biva's work.

Janet Whitmore writes of Henri Biva's work, something that could apply to many of his paintings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Like the naturalist painters such as [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]] or [[Rosa Bonheur]]", writes Janet Whitmore, "there is a strong tactile quality to Biva’s work, focused on the shapes, colors and forms of the small plants beside the stream or the smooth grey surface of the tree trunks". Equally important, she writes, "this type of landscape painting offered an intimate glimpse of a specific locale, a reminder of days spent in the French countryside, or perhaps at the immense forest preserves surrounding Paris. Unlike contemporaries such as [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]] or [[Claude Monet|Monet]], Biva’s landscapes suggest a time before industrialization when no railroad or factory disrupted rural vistas. Rather, these images show no evidence of human activity at all except for the occasional fisherman drowsing by the riverside. (Janet Whitmore, Ph.D.)&lt;ref name="Janet Whitmore"&gt;[http://www.fada.com/browse_by_artist.html?gallery_no=2&amp;artist=2710&amp;bio=1 Janet Whitmore, Ph.D., a biography of Henri Biva] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105085202/http://www.fada.com/browse_by_artist.html?gallery_no=2&amp;artist=2710&amp;bio=1 |date=2011-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{National Literary "Matters"}}
According to the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[poetry|poet]] [[Jean Bodel]], the '''Matter of Rome''' was the [[literature cycle|literary cycle]] made up of [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], together with episodes from the history of [[classical antiquity]], focusing on military heroes like [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Julius Caesar]].  Bodel divided all the literary cycles he knew best into the [[Matter of Britain]], the [[Matter of France]] and the Matter of Rome (although "non-cyclical" [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] also existed).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Laura A | last = Hibbard | title = Medieval Romance in England | place = New York | publisher = Burt Franklin | year = 1963 | page = iii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Matter of Rome also included what is referred to as the Matter of Troy, consisting of romances and other texts based on the [[Trojan War]] and its after-effects, including the adventures of [[Aeneas]].&lt;ref name=Fowler&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Robert|title=The Cambridge Companion To Homer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K5WQRBvMp18C&amp;pg=PA364|accessdate=21 July 2012|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge UP|isbn=9780521012461|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject matter==
Classical topics were the subjects of a good deal of [[Old French]] literature, which in the case of Trojan subject matter ultimately deriving from [[Homer]] was built on scant sources; since the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' were unknown, medieval Western poets had to make do with two short prose narratives based on Homer, ascribed to [[Dictys Cretensis]] and [[Dares Phrygius]]. The paucity of original text did not prevent the 12th century Norman poet [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]] from writing a lengthy adaptation, ''Le Roman de Troie'', running 40,000 lines.&lt;ref name=Fowler/&gt; The poems that were written on these topics were called the ''romans d'antiquité'', the "romances of antiquity."  This name presages the [[anachronism|anachronistic]] approach the medieval poets used in dealing with these subjects.  For example, in the [[Epic poetry| epic]] poems ''[[Roman d'Alixandre]]'' and the ''[[Roman de Troie]]'', Alexander the Great, and [[Achilles]] and his fellow heroes of the [[Trojan War]] were treated as knights of [[chivalry]], not much different from the heroes of the ''[[chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]''.&lt;ref&gt;W. P. Ker, ''Epic And Romance: Essays on Medieval Literature'' p 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Elements of [[courtly love]] were introduced into the poems; in the ''[[Roman de Thèbes]]'', a romantic relationship absent from the [[Greek language|Greek]] sources is introduced into the tale of [[Parthenopeus| Parthenopæus]] and [[Antigone]].  Military episodes in these tales were also multiplied, and used to introduce scenes of [[knight-errant]]ry and [[tournament (medieval)|tournaments]].  

Another example of French medieval poetry in this genre is the [[Roman d'Enéas|''Eneas'']], a treatment of the ''[[Aeneid]]'' that comes across as being a sort of burlesque of [[Virgil]]'s poem.  Sentimental and fantasy elements in the source material were multiplied, and incidents from [[Ovid]], the most popular Latin poet of the Middle Ages, were mixed into the [[pastiche]].  The ''Philomela'' attributed to [[Chrétien de Troyes]], a retelling of the story of [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]] and [[Procne]], also takes its source from Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''.

[[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' is an English example, with Chaucer adding many elements to emphasize its connection with the matter.&lt;ref name = "Lewis"&gt;{{Citation | authorlink = C. S. Lewis | first = Clive Staples | last = Lewis | title = Selected Literary Essays | publisher = University Press | place = Cambridge, ENG, UK | year = 1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |30–1}}  He also brought the story into line with the precepts of [[courtly love]].&lt;ref name = "Lewis" /&gt;{{rp |35–6}}

This anachronistic treatment of elements from Greek mythology is similar to that of the [[Middle English]] [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]] "[[Sir Orfeo]]", where the Greek [[Orpheus]] becomes the knight Sir Orfeo who rescues his wife Heurodis (i.e. [[Eurydice]]) from the [[fairy]] king.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15179">[[File:Mauricio Kagel (1985).jpg|thumb|Mauricio Kagel, 1985]]
'''Mauricio Raúl Kagel''' ({{IPA-es|mauˈɾisjo ˈkaɣel}}; December 24, 1931 – September 18, 2008) was a [[Germans|German]]-[[Argentina|Argentine]] [[composer]] notable for developing the [[theatrical]] side of musical [[performance]] {{harv|Grimshaw|2009}}. He spent his last fifty years in Germany, dying after a long illness at the age of 76 {{harv|Nonnenmann|2008}}.

==Biography==
Kagel was born in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], into an Ashkenazi Jewish family that had fled from Russia in the 1920s {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}. He studied music, history of [[literature]], and [[philosophy]] in [[Buenos Aires]] {{harv|Grimshaw|2009}}. In 1957 he moved as a scholar to [[Cologne]], Germany, where he lived until his death.

===As teacher===

From 1960–66 and 1972–76 he taught at the [[Darmstädter Ferienkurse|International Summer School at Darmstadt]] {{harv|Attinello|2001}}. He also taught from 1964–65 at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] as [[Slee Professor of music theory]]. At the [[Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin|Berlin Film and Television Academy]] he was a visiting lecturer. He served as director of courses for new music in [[Gothenburg]] and Cologne {{harv|Attinello|2001}}. He was professor for new music theatre at the [[Cologne Conservatory]] from 1974–97.&lt;!--Attinello 2001 would cover this as well, except he does not give the terminal date.--&gt; Among his students were [[Maria de Alvear]], [[Carola Bauckholt]], [[Branimir Krstić]], [[David Sawer]], {{ill|Rickard Scheffer|sv}}, [[Juan Maria Solare]], [[Gerald Barry (composer)|Gerald Barry]], and [[Chao-Ming Tung]]. {{See LMST|Mauricio|Kagel}}

===As composer===

Some of his pieces give specific theatrical instructions to the performers {{harv|Kennedy and Bourne|2006}}, such as to adopt certain facial expressions while playing, to make their stage entrances in a particular way, to physically interact with other performers, and so on. For this reason commentators at times related his work to the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} He has been regarded by music historians as deploying a critical intelligence interrogating the position of music in society {{harv|Griffiths|1978|loc=188}}.&lt;!--Is this a quote or paraphrase?--&gt; He was also active in the fields of film and photography, proving that the possibilities of music are inexhaustible.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 1991 Kagel was invited by [[Walter Fink]] as the second composer featured in the annual [[Rheingau Musik Festival#Portraits of living composers|Komponistenporträt]] of the [[Rheingau Musik Festival]]. In 2000 he received the [[Ernst von Siemens Music Prize]].

==Works==
''Staatstheater'' (1970) remains, probably, Kagel’s best-known work. It is the piece that most clearly shows his absurdist tendency.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} He described it as a “[[ballet]] for non-dancers,”{{Cite quote|date=September 2008}} although it is in many ways more like an [[opera]]; the devices it uses as [[musical instrument]]s include [[chamber pot]]s and [[enema]] equipment. As the work progresses, the piece itself, and opera and ballet in general, becomes its own subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Similar is the [[radio]] [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''Ein Aufnahmezustand'' (1969) which is about the incidents surrounding the recording of a radio play. In ''Con voce'' (With Voice), a masked trio silently mimes playing instruments. ''Match'' (1964), is a “tennis game” for cellists with a percussionist as umpire {{harv|Griffiths|1978|loc=188}} (for [[Siegfried Palm]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;!--Formerly offered citation, [http://www.bertdekkers.nl/klassiek/kagel_list.html Kagel: Match], lists a recording made by Palm, but does not confirm the work was written for him.--&gt;), also the subject of one of Kagel's films and perhaps the best-known of his works of instrumental theatre {{harv|Griffiths|1981|loc=812}}.

But Kagel wrote a large number of more conventional “pure” pieces too, including [[orchestra]]l music, [[chamber music]]. Many of these make references to music of the past by, among others, Beethoven, Brahms, Bach and Liszt ({{harvnb|Warnaby|1981|loc=38}}; {{harvnb|Decarsin|1985|loc=260}}).

Kagel also made [[film]]s, with one of the best known being ''[[Ludwig van (film)|Ludwig van]]'' (1970), a critical interrogation of the uses of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s music made during the bicentenary of that composer's birth {{harv|Griffiths|1978|loc=188}}. In it, a reproduction of Beethoven's studio is seen, as part of a fictive visit of the [[Beethoven House]] in [[Bonn]]. Everything in it is papered with sheet music of Beethoven's pieces. The soundtrack of the film is a [[piano]] playing the music as it appears in each shot. Because the music has been wrapped around curves and edges, it is somewhat distorted, but Beethovenian motifs can still be heard. In other parts, the film contains parodies of radio or TV broadcasts connected with the "Beethoven Year 1770". Kagel later turned the film into a piece of sheet music itself which could be performed in a concert without the film—the score consists of close-ups of various areas of the studio, which are to be interpreted by the performing [[pianist]].

'''Movie Theaters and hand painted Movie Posters in Ghana''' are a cultural component of this West African state.

== History ==
In the 1980s, thanks to the invention of video recorders, the first small cinemas came up in the Greater Accra Region in Ghana. In those years the cinemas were often mobile. Their operators used to travel in the whole region with a selection of movie cassettes, a TV set, a VCR and a generator, going from one village to the next to show their films. To draw attention to their performances, they announced them with colourful hand painted movie posters. These were provided by the local film distributors who collaborated with artists and sign painters like Daniel Anum Jasper, Heavy Jeaurs, Leonardo, Kwesi Blue, Salvation or Dallas who created for each movie a matching billboard.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe Ernie, Clive Barker: Extreme Canvas. Handpaintedd movie posters from Ghana. Los Angeles, Dilettante Press/Kesho Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sign painters ==
The artists and sign writers looked first at the films that were mostly made in Ghana or Nigeria, and then developed their film poster. For the mobile cinemas, these works had to be sturdy, cheap to produce, and light in weight because the cinema operators had to move around with the material. Therefore, the artists used a cheap, but very durable and light linen underlay which they gained from Ghanaian flour sacks. This material adhered very well with their oil and acrylic paints and the posters could even be hung outdoors when it rained. With their bright colors and an iconography adapted to the Ghanaian audiences, these paintings immediately caught the attention of the people and made them much more likely to go to the cinema than the normal posters that were printed in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Michelle: Shocking Images: Ghanaian Painted Posters. In: Ghana, Yesterday and Today, Musée Dapper 2003, pp.353-379.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New developments ==
Since Ghanaians now buy or rent their films on DVD and prefer to watch them at home, they no more go to the small cinemas. Most of the movie houses had to close in the recent years, and the few that are left can barely afford hand-painted movie posters, they rather use printed ones. Therefore, in the Region of Greater Accra, there are hardly any cinemas left who still use hand painted movie posters. Many artists who used to work for the film distributors have turned to other tasks. They are painting street signs that are still very popular in Ghana, and in the Greater Accra Region some are also assisting other artists like [[Paa Joe]] or [[Kudjoe Affutu]] in painting their [[Fantasy coffin|figurative coffins]], [[Figurative palanquin|palanquins]] and small sculptures. Some sign painters, such as Heavy J., Moses, Jasper, Farkira or Leonardo,&lt;ref&gt;Tschumi, Regula: Hors-Champs. Genèse de l'affiche de l'exposition. Exh. Cat. Hors-champs, Atelier PréTexte Neuchâtel, 2013, pp. 218-221.&lt;/ref&gt; also work for the international art market, where Ghanaian movie posters as well as the figurative coffins are shown in exhibitions of [[contemporary African art]] where they are getting more and more attention.&lt;ref&gt;Barlovic, Ingo, Wolfgang Stäbler: Faszinierende Werbekunst: Gemalte Filmplakate aus Ghana.

In the [[music industry]], a '''music publisher''' (or '''publishing company''') is responsible for ensuring the [[songwriter]]s and [[composer]]s receive payment when their [[musical composition|composition]]s are used commercially. Through an agreement called a [[publishing contract]], a songwriter or composer "assigns" the [[copyright]] of their composition to a publishing company. In return, the company licenses compositions, helps monitor where compositions are used, collects [[royalties]] and distributes them to the composers. They also secure commissions for music and promote existing compositions to [[recording artist]]s, film and television.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web | title = What is music publishing? | url = http://www.mpaonline.org.uk/FAQ | publisher = music publishers association }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The copyrights owned and administered by publishing companies are one of the most important forms of [[intellectual property]] in the music industry. (The other is the copyright on a [[master recording]] which is typically owned by a [[record company]]) Publishing companies play a central role in managing this vital asset.

==The music publisher's role==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}

Successful songwriters and composers have a relationship with a publishing company defined by a [[publishing contract]].  Publishers also sometimes provide substantial advances against future income. In return, the publishing company receives a percentage, which can be as high as 50% and varies for different kinds of royalty.

There are several types of royalty: [[Royalties#Mechanical royalties|mechanical royalties]] derive from the sale of recorded music, such as CDs or digital downloads. These royalties are paid to publishers by [[record companies]] (through the [[Harry Fox Agency]] as well as through [http://www.amermechrights.com American Mechanical Rights Agency] in the U.S.). [[Royalties#Performance royalties|Performance royalties]] are collected by [[performance rights organization]]s such as [[SESAC]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], [[ASCAP]] or [[PRS_for_Music|PRS]] and are paid by radio stations and others who broadcast recorded music; and are paid by venues, event organizers for live performances of the compositions. [[Royalties#Synchronization royalties|Synchronization royalties]] are required when a composition is used in a film or television soundtrack. These royalties typically pass through the hands of a music publisher before they reach the composer.

Publishers also work to link up new songs by songwriters with suitable [[recording artist]]s to record them and to place writers' songs in other media such as movie [[soundtrack]]s and commercials. They will typically also handle [[copyright registration]] and "ownership" matters for the composer. Music print publishers also supervise the issue of [[songbook]]s and [[sheet music]] by their artists.

==Publishing disputes==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

Traditionally, music publishing royalties are split seventy/thirty, with thirty percent going to the publisher (as payment for their services) and the rest going to the songwriter &amp;ndash; or songwriters, as the case may be. Other arrangements have been made in the past, and continue to be; some better for the writers, some better for the publishers. Occasionally a recording artist will ask for a co-writer's credit on a song (thus sharing in both the artist and publishing royalties) in exchange for selecting it to perform, particularly if the writer is not well known. Sometimes an artist's manager or producer will expect a co-credit or share of the publishing (as with [[Norman Petty]] and [[Phil Spector]]), and occasionally a publisher will insist on writer's credit (as [[Morris Levy]] did with several of his acts); these practices are listed in ascending order of scrupulousness, as regarded by the music industry.

The most unscrupulous type of music publisher is the [[songshark]], who does little if any real "legwork" or promotion on behalf of songwriters. Songsharks make their profit not on royalties from sales, but by charging inexperienced writers for "services" (some real, such as [[demo (music)|demo]] recording or [[musical arrangement|musical arranging]], some fictional, such as "audition" or "review" fees) a legitimate publisher would provide without cost to the writer, as part of their job. (By comparison, a bona fide publisher who charges admission to a workshop for writers, where songs may be auditioned or reviewed, isn't wrong to do so.)

Rock-n-roll pioneer [[Buddy Holly]] split with longtime manager Norman Petty over publishing matters in late 1958, as did the [[The Buckinghams|Buckinghams]] with producer [[James William Guercio]] almost a decade later. [[John Fogerty]] of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] was sued by his former publisher [[Saul Zaentz]] (who'd also served as his manager) over a later Fogerty song that sounded slightly like a CCR song Zaentz published. (Fogerty won in court.)

Several bands and artists own (or later purchase) their own publishing, and start their own companies, with or without help from an outside agent. The sale or loss of publishing ownership can be devastating to a given artist or writer, financially and emotionally. R&amp;B legend [[Little Richard]] was largely cheated on his music publishing and copyrights, as were many performers. [[Brian Wilson]] and [[Mike Love]] of [[The Beach Boys]] were crushed to learn that [[Murry Wilson]] (father to three of the Beach Boys, Love's uncle, and the band's music publisher) had sold their company [[Sea of Tunes]] to [[A&amp;M Records]] during 1969 for a fraction of what it was worth &amp;ndash; or earned in the following years.

A large factor in the [[Beatles]]' breakup was when their publisher [[Dick James]] sold his share of [[Northern Songs]], the company they'd formed with him in 1963 (then taken public in 1967, with shares trading on the [[London Stock Exchange]]), to Britain's Associated TeleVision ([[Associated TeleVision|ATV]]) in 1969. Neither the Beatles nor managers [[Lee Eastman]] and [[Allen Klein]] were able to prevent ATV from becoming majority stockholders in Northern Songs, whose assets included virtually all the group's song copyrights. Losing control of the company, [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] elected to sell their share of Northern Songs (and thus their own copyrights), while retaining their writer's royalties. ([[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]] retained minority holdings in the company.)

'''''On the Sublime''''' (Περì Ὕψους Perì Hýpsous) is a [[Roman Greece|Roman-era Greek]] work of [[literary criticism]] dated to the 1st century AD. Its author is unknown, but is conventionally referred to as '''Longinus''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɒ|n|ˈ|dʒ|aɪ|n|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc|Λογγῖνος}} ''Longĩnos'') or '''Pseudo-Longinus'''. It is regarded as a classic work on [[aesthetics]] and the effects of good writing. The treatise highlights examples of good and bad writing from the previous millennium, focusing particularly on what may lead to the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].

The author's identity has been debated for centuries. The oldest surviving manuscript, from the 10th century, indicates the original author was named "Dionysius or Longinus", which was later misread as "Dionysius Longinus". Subsequent interpretations have attributed the work to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (1st century) or [[Cassius Longinus (philosopher)|Cassius Longinus]] (c. 213–273 AD), though neither is now widely accepted.

==Authorship ==
The author is unknown. In the 10th-century reference manuscript (Parisinus Graecus 2036), the heading reports "Dionysius or Longinus", an ascription by the  medieval [[copyist]] that was misread as "by Dionysius Longinus." When the manuscript was being prepared for printed publication, the work was initially attributed to [[Cassius Longinus (philosopher)|Cassius Longinus]] (c. 213–273 AD). Since the correct translation includes the possibility of an author named "Dionysius", some have attributed the work to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a writer of the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Grube"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grube|first=G.M.A|title=On Great Writing (On the Sublime) |publisher=The Liberal Arts Press|location=New York|year=1957|isbn=978-0-87220-080-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; There remains the possibility that the work belongs to neither Cassius Longinus nor Dionysius of Halicarnassus, but, rather, some unknown author writing under the [[Roman Empire]], likely in the 1st century. The error does imply that when the [[codex]] was written, the trails of the real author were already lost. Neither author can be accepted as the actual writer of the treatise. Dionysius maintained ideas which are absolutely opposite to those written in the treatise; with Longinus, there are problems with chronology.

Among further names proposed, are Hermagoras (a rhetorician who lived in Rome during the 1st century AD), [[Aelius Theon]] (author of a work which had many ideas in common with those of ''On the Sublime''), and Pompeius Geminus (who was in epistolary conversation with Dionysius).

===Dionysius of Halicarnassus===
[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] wrote under Augustus, publishing a number of works. Dionysius is generally dismissed as the potential author of ''On the Sublime'', since the writing officially attributed to Dionysius differs from the work ''On the Sublime'' in style and thought.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Andrew Russell|title='Longinus' on the Sublime|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cassius Longinus===
Credited with writing a number of literary works, Longinus was disciple of [[Plotinus]], and considered "the most distinguished scholar of his day." He received his education at Alexandria and then went to Athens to teach. He later moved to Asia Minor, where he achieved the position of advisor to [[Zenobia]], the queen of [[Palmyra]].&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"&gt;Longinus. (1851, Jul 01). Robert Merry's Museum (1841-1851), 22, 179. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/135926705&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Longinus. 9 Vol. Detroit: The Gale Group Inc, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Cassius is a dubious possibility for author of the treatise because he wrote in the 3rd century, and no literature later than the 1st century AD is mentioned (the latest is [[Cicero]], who died in 43 BC){{clarify|date=April 2017|Last citations are 1st C AD by Cicero who died 1st C BC?}} and the work is now usually dated to the early 1st century AD. The work ends with a dissertation on the decay of oratory, a typical subject for the time when authors such as [[Tacitus]], [[Petronius]] and [[Quintilian]], who also dealt with the subject, were alive.  Cassius was executed by Aurelian, the Roman emperor who conquered Palmyra in 273 AD were on charges of conspiring against the Roman state. This was most likely because of what he had written for Queen Zenobia of Palmyra while she was still in power. Longinus is reported to have written answers for the Queen, which were used in response to Aurelian, the man who would soon rise to power as the Roman emperor.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt;

==Contents==
''On the Sublime'' is both a treatise on [[aesthetics]] and a work of literary criticism. It is written in an epistolary form and the final part, possibly dealing with public speaking, has been lost.

The treatise is dedicated to Posthumius Terentianus, a cultured Roman and public figure, though little else is known of him. ''On the Sublime'' is a compendium of literary exemplars, with about 50 authors spanning 1,000 years mentioned or quoted.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=William Rhys|title=Longinus on the Sublime|year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the expected examples from [[Homer]] and other figures of Greek culture, Longinus refers to a passage from ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'', which is quite unusual for the 1st century:

{{quote|A similar effect was achieved by the lawgiver of the Jews—no mean genius, for he both understood and gave expression to the power of the divinity as it deserved—when he wrote at the very beginning of his laws, and I quote his words: "God said,"—what was it?—"Let there be light, and there was. Let there be earth, and there was."|''On the Sublime'' 9.9}}

Given his positive reference to Genesis, Longinus has been assumed to be either a Hellenized Jew or readily familiar with the Jewish culture.&lt;ref name="Leitch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leitch|first=Vincent B.|title=The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism|publisher=Norton|year=2001|pages=135–154|isbn=978-0-393-97429-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Longinus emphasizes that, to be a truly great writer, authors must have "moral excellence".&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; In fact, critics speculate that Longinus avoided publication in the ancient world "either by modesty or by prudential motives".&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Moreover, Longinus stresses that transgressive writers are not necessarily shameless fools, even if they take literary risks that seem "bold, lawless, and original".&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; As for social subjectivity, Longinus acknowledges that complete liberty promotes spirit and hope; according to Longinus, "never did a slave become an orator".&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blair|first=Hugh |author2=Abraham Mills |title=From Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres|publisher=T. Zell|year=1866|edition=2nd|pages=950–979}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, too much luxury and wealth leads to a decay in eloquence—eloquence being the goal of the [[sublimity|sublime]] writer.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

===The sublime===
Longinus critically applauds and condemns certain literary works as examples of good or bad styles of writing.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Longinus ultimately promotes an "elevation of style"&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; and an essence of "simplicity".&lt;ref name="Brody"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brody|first=Jules|title=Boileau and Longinus|publisher=E. Droz|year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; To quote this famous author, "the first and most important source of sublimity [is] the power of forming great conceptions."&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt; The concept of the [[sublimity|sublime]] is generally accepted to refer to a style of writing that elevates itself "above the ordinary". Finally, Longinus sets out five sources of sublimity: "great thoughts, strong emotions, certain figures of thought and speech, noble diction, and dignified word arrangement".&lt;ref name="Leitch" /&gt;

The effects of the Sublime are: loss of rationality, an alienation leading to identification with the creative process of the artist and a deep emotion mixed in pleasure and exaltation. An example of sublime (which the author quotes in the work) is a poem by [[Sappho]], the so-called ''Ode to Jealousy'', defined as a "Sublime ode". A writer's goal is not so much to express empty feelings, but to arouse emotion in her audience.&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt;

In the treatise, the author asserts that "the Sublime leads the listeners not to persuasion, but to ecstasy: for what is wonderful always goes together with a sense of dismay, and prevails over what is only convincing or delightful, since persuasion, as a rule, is within everyone's grasp: whereas, the Sublime, giving to speech an invincible power and [an invincible] strength, rises above every listener".&lt;ref&gt;''On the Sublime'' 1.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this statement, one could think that the sublime, for Longinus, was only a moment of evasion from reality. But on the contrary, he thought that literature could model a soul, and that a soul could pour itself out into a work of art. In this way the treatise becomes not only a text of literary inquiry, but also one of ethical dissertation, since the Sublime becomes the product of a ''great soul'' ({{lang|grc|μεγαλοφροσύνης ἀπήχημα}}, ''megalophrosunēs apēchēma''). The sources of the Sublime are of two kinds: inborn sources ("aspiration to vigorous concepts" and "strong and enthusiastic passion") and acquirable sources (rhetorical devices, choice of the right lexicon, and "dignified and high composition").&lt;ref name="Brody" /&gt;

===Decay of rhetoric===
The author speaks also about the decay of oratory, as arising not only from absence of personal freedom but also from the corruption of morals, which together destroy that high spirit which generates the Sublime. Thus the treatise is clearly centred in the burning controversy which raged in the 1st century AD in Latin literature. If [[Petronius]] pointed out excess of rhetoric and the pompous, unnatural techniques of the schools of eloquence as the causes of decay, [[Tacitus]] was nearer to Longinus in thinking&lt;ref name="Grube"/&gt; that the root of this decadence was the establishment of Princedom, or Empire, which, though it brought stability and peace, also gave rise to censorship and brought an end to freedom of speech. Thus oratory became merely an exercise in style.

===Misleading translations and lost data===
Translators have been unable to clearly interpret the text, including the title itself. The "sublime" in the title has been translated in various ways, to include senses of elevation and excellent style. The word [[sublimity|sublime]], argues Rhys Roberts, is misleading, since Longinus' objective broadly concerns "the essentials of a noble and impressive style" than anything more narrow and specific. Moreover, about one-third of the treatise is missing;&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Longinus' segment on similes, for instance, has only a few words remaining.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; Matters are further complicated in realizing that ancient writers, Longinus' contemporaries, do not quote or mention the treatise in any way.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

===Limitations of the writing===
Despite Longinus' critical acclaim, his writing is far from perfect. Longinus' occasional enthusiasm becomes "carried away" and creates some confusion as to the meaning of his text. Furthermore, 18th-century critic [[Edward Burnaby Greene]] finds Longinus, at times, to be "too refined".&lt;ref name="Greene" /&gt; Greene also claims that Longinus' focus on hyperbolical descriptions is "particularly weak, and misapplied."&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; Occasionally, Longinus also falls into a sort of "tediousness" in treating his subjects.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; The treatise is also limited in its concentration on spiritual transcendence and lack of focus on the way in which language structures determine the feelings and thoughts of writers.&lt;ref name="Leitch" /&gt; Finally, Longinus' treatise is difficult to explain in an academic setting, given the difficulty of the text and lack of "practical rules of a teachable kind."&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

===Writing style and rhetoric===
Despite its faults, the treatise remains critically successful because of its "noble tone," "apt precepts," "judicious attitude," and "historical interests".&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; One of the reasons why it is so unlikely that known ancient critics wrote ''On the Sublime'' is because the treatise is composed so differently from any other literary work. Since Longinus' rhetorical formula avoids dominating his work, the literature remains "personal and fresh," unique in its originality. Longinus rebels against the popular rhetoric of the time by implicitly attacking ancient theory in its focus on a detailed criticism of words, metaphors, and figures. More explicitly, in refusing to judge tropes as entities unto themselves, Longinus promotes the appreciation of literary devices as they relate to passages as a whole.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; Essentially, Longinus, rare for a critic of his time, focuses more on "greatness of style" than "technical rules."&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Despite his criticism of ancient texts, Longinus remains a "master of candor and good-nature".&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greene|first=Edward Burnaby|title=Critical Essays: 1770|year=1973|isbn=978-0-85417-911-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the author invents striking images and metaphors, writing almost lyrically at times.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; In general, Longinus appreciates, and makes use of, simple diction and bold images.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;

As far as the language is concerned, the work is certainly a unicum because it is a blend of expressions of the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek]] to which are added elevated constructions, technical expressions, metaphors, classic and rare forms which produce a literary pastiche at the borders of linguistic experimentation.

===Influences===
In reading ''On the Sublime'', critics have determined that the ancient philosopher and writer Plato is a "great hero" to Longinus.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; Not only does Longinus come to Plato's defense, but he also attempts to raise his literary standing in opposition to current criticisms. Another influence on the treatise can be found in Longinus' rhetorical figures, which draw from theories by a 1st-century BC writer, [[Caecilius of Calacte]].&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;

==Historical criticism and use of ''On the Sublime''==
*10th century - The original treatise, before translation, is copied into a medieval manuscript and attributed to "Dionysius or Longinus."&lt;ref name="Leitch" /&gt;
*13th century - A Byzantine rhetorician makes obscure references to what may be Longinus' text.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt;
*16th century - The treatise is ignored by scholars until it is published by [[Francis Robortello]] in [[Basel]], in 1554, and Niccolò da Falgano, in 1560.&lt;ref name="Leitch" /&gt; The original work is attributed to "Dionysius Longinus" and most European countries receive translations of the treatise.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt;
*17th century - Sublime effects become a desired end of much [[Baroque]] art and literature, and the rediscovered work of "Longinus" goes through half a dozen editions in the 17th century. It is [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]'s 1674 translation of the treatise into French that really starts its career in the history of criticism. Despite its popularity, some critics claim that the treatise was too "primitive" to be truly understood by a "too civilized" 17th-century audience.
*18th century - [[William Smith (scholar)|William Smith's]] 1739 translation of ''Longinus on the Sublime'' established the translator and once more brought the work into prominence. Longinus' text reaches its height in popularity.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; In England, critics esteem Longinus' principles of composition and balance second only to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' and Immanuel Kant's ''Critique of the Power of Judgment''&lt;ref&gt;Clewis, Robert R. (2009). ''The Kantian Sublime and the Revelation of Freedom''. Cambridge University Press, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; owe a debt to Longinus' concept of the [[sublimity|sublime]], and the category passes into intellectual discourse. As "Longinus" says, "The effect of elevated language upon an audience is not persuasion but transport," a fitting sentiment for Romantic thinkers and writers who reach beyond logic, to the wellsprings of the Sublime. At the same time, the Romantics gain some contempt for Longinus, given his association with the "rules" of classical poets. Such contempt is ironic, given the widespread influence of Longinus on the shaping of 18th-century criticism.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;
*19th century - Early in the 19th century, doubts arise to the authorship of the treatise. Thanks to Italian scholar Amati, Cassius Longinus is no longer assumed to be the writer of ''On the Sublime''.&lt;ref name="Roberts" /&gt; Simultaneously, the critical popularity of Longinus' work diminishes greatly; though the work is still in use by scholars, it is rarely quoted. Despite the lack of public enthusiasm, editions and translations of ''On the Sublime'' are published at the end of the century.&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt;
*20th century - Although the text is still little quoted, it maintains its status, apart from Aristotle's ''Poetics'', as "the most delightful of all the critical works of classical antiquity."&lt;ref name="Grube" /&gt; Also see [[Neil Hertz]]'s essay on Longinus in his book, ''The End of the Line.'' Hertz is in part responding to [[Thomas Weiskel]]'s book ''The Romantic Sublime'', probably the most influential recent account of British and German Romantic attitudes towards the Sublime of both Burke and Longinus.&lt;ref name="Hertz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hertz|first=Neil|title=The End of the Line|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1985|isbn=978-0-231-05708-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiskel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Weiskel|author2=Portia Williams Weiskel |title=The Romantic Sublime|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1976|isbn=978-0-8018-1770-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Quinney treats the attractions grim demystification in analyzes of Longinus, particularly Weiskel's.&lt;ref name="Quinney2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Quinney|first=Laura|title=Weiskel's Sublime and the Impasse of Knowledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Culler has an appreciation of Hertz on Longinus in "The Hertzian Sublime."&lt;ref name="Culler"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|title=The Hertzian sublime|journal=[[MLN]]|volume=120|issue=5|pages=969–985|doi=10.1353/mln.2006.0007|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Anne Carson]] and [[Louis Marin (philosopher)|Louis Marin]] have occasion to discuss Longinus as well and [[Harold Bloom]] and William J. Kennedy have significant accounts of his work. [[William Carlos Williams]] also uses three lines from the work as an epigraph to the Prologue to [[Kora in Hell]].&lt;ref name="Carson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carson|first=Anne|title=Conjunctions|year=2001|pages=96–104|chapter=Foam: (Essay with Rhapsody) On the Sublime in Longinus and Antonioni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marin|first=Louis|author2=Nicolas Poussin |author3=Catherine Porter |title=The Sublime Poussin|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8047-3477-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=William J.|author2=Brenda Deen Schildgen |title=The Rhetoric Canon|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1997|chapter=Interest in the Canon: Kant in the Context of Longinus and Adorno|isbn=978-0-8143-2632-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German film director [[Werner Herzog]] claims to have an affinity with the work of Longinus, in a talk entitled "On the Absolute, the Sublime and Ecstatic Truth", presented in Milan. Herzog says that he thinks of Longinus as a good friend and considers that Longinus's notions of illumination has a parallel in some moments in his films. He quotes from Longinus: "For our soul is raised out of nature through the truly sublime, sways with high spirits, and is filled with proud joy, as if itself had created what it hears."

{{for|the Poincaré group (fundamental group) of a topological space|Fundamental group}}
{{Group theory sidebar |Topological}}

The '''Poincaré group''', named after [[Henri Poincaré]] (1906),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Poincaré, Henri |date=&lt;!--1905–6--&gt; |title=[[s:fr:Sur la dynamique de l’électron (juillet)|Sur la dynamique de l’électron]] |journal=Rendiconti del Circolo matematico di Palermo |volume=21 |pages=129–176 |doi=10.1007/bf03013466}} ([[Wikisource]] translation: [[s:On the Dynamics of the Electron (July)|On the Dynamics of the Electron]]). The group defined in this paper would now be described as the homogeneous Lorentz group with scalar multipliers. &lt;/ref&gt; was first defined by Minkowski (1908) as the [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of [[Minkowski_space#Lorentz transformations and symmetry|Minkowski spacetime isometries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Minkowski, Hermann |date=&lt;!--1907–8--&gt; |title=[[s:de:Die Grundgleichungen für die elektromagnetischen Vorgänge in bewegten Körpern|Die Grundgleichungen für die elektromagnetischen Vorgänge in bewegten Körpern]] |journal=Nachrichten von der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, Mathematisch-Physikalische Klasse |pages=53–111}} (Wikisource translation: [[s:The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies|The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Minkowski, Hermann |date=&lt;!--1908–9--&gt; |title=[[s:de:Raum und Zeit (Minkowski)|Raum und Zeit]] |journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |volume=10 |pages=75–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ten-dimensional [[Non-abelian group|non-abelian]] [[Lie group]] of fundamental importance in [[physics]].

== Overview ==
A [[Minkowski_space#Lorentz transformations and symmetry|Minkowski spacetime isometry]] has the property that the interval between [[event (relativity)|event]]s is left invariant. For example, if everything was postponed by two hours, including the two events and the path you took to go from one to the other, then the time interval between the events recorded by a stop-watch you carried with you would be the same. Or if everything was shifted five kilometres to the west, or turned 60 degrees to the right, you would also see no change in the interval. It turns out that the [[proper length]] of an object is also unaffected by such a shift. A time or space reversal (a reflection) is also an isometry of this group.

In Minkowski space (i.e. ignoring the effects of [[gravity]]), there are ten degrees of freedom of the [[Minkowski_space#Lorentz transformations and symmetry|isometries]], which may be thought of as translation through time or space (four degrees, one per dimension); reflection through a plane (three degrees, the freedom in orientation of this plane); or a "[[Lorentz transformation|boost]]" in any of the three spatial directions (three degrees). Composition of transformations is the operator of the Poincaré group, with proper rotations being produced as the composition of an even number of reflections.

In [[classical physics]], the [[Galilean group]] is a comparable ten-parameter group that acts on [[absolute time and space]]. Instead of boosts, it features [[shear mapping]]s to relate co-moving frames of reference.

== Poincaré symmetry ==
'''Poincaré symmetry''' is the full symmetry of [[special relativity]]. It includes:
* ''[[Translation (physics)|translation]]s'' (displacements) in time and space ('''''P'''''), forming the [[Abelian group|abelian]] [[Lie group]] of translations on space-time;
* ''[[rotation]]s'' in space, forming the non-Abelian Lie group of [[three-dimensional rotation]]s ('''''J''''');
* ''[[Lorentz transformation|boosts]]'', transformations connecting two uniformly moving bodies ('''''K''''').

The last two symmetries, '''''J''''' and '''''K''''', together make the [[Lorentz group]] (see also [[Lorentz invariance]]); the [[semi-direct product]] of the translations group and the Lorentz group then produce the Poincaré group. Objects which are invariant under this group are then said to possess '''Poincaré invariance''' or '''relativistic invariance'''.

== Poincaré group ==
The Poincaré group is the group of Minkowski spacetime [[Minkowski_space#Lorentz transformations and symmetry|isometries]]. It is a ten-dimensional [[Compact space|noncompact]] [[Lie group]]. The [[abelian group]] of [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s is a [[normal subgroup]], while the [[Lorentz group]] is also a subgroup, the [[Group action#Orbits and stabilizers|stabilizer]] of the origin. The Poincaré group itself is the minimal subgroup of the [[affine group]] which includes all translations and [[Lorentz transformation]]s. More precisely, it is a [[semidirect product]] of the translations and the Lorentz group, 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{1,3} \rtimes \mathrm{O}(1,3) \,,&lt;/math&gt;
with group multiplication
:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha, f) \cdot (\beta, g) = (\alpha + f \cdot \beta, \; f \cdot g)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=mVovDwAAQBAJ|title=BMS Particles in Three Dimensions|last=Oblak|first=Blagoje|date=2017-08-01|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9783319618784|location=|pages=80|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of putting this is that the Poincaré group is a [[group extension]] of the [[Lorentz group]] by a vector [[Group representation|representation]] of it; it is sometimes dubbed, informally, as the '''inhomogeneous Lorentz group'''. In turn, it can also be obtained as a [[group contraction]] of the de Sitter group SO(4,1) ~ Sp(2,2), as the [[de Sitter space|de Sitter radius]] goes to infinity.

Its positive energy unitary irreducible [[Representation of a Lie group|representations]] are indexed by [[mass]] (nonnegative number) and [[Spin (physics)|spin]] ([[integer]] or half integer) and are associated with particles in [[quantum mechanics]] (see [[Wigner's classification]]).

In accordance with the [[Erlangen program]], the geometry of Minkowski space is defined by the Poincaré group: Minkowski space is considered as a [[homogeneous space]] for the group.

In [[quantum field theory]], the universal cover of the Poincaré group
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{1,3} \rtimes \mathrm{SL}(2,C) &lt;/math&gt;
and the double cover
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^{1,3} \rtimes \mathrm{Spin}(1,3) &lt;/math&gt;
are more important, because representations of &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{SO}(1,3)&lt;/math&gt; are not able to describe fields with spin 1/2, i.e. [[fermions]].  Here &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{SL}(2,C)&lt;/math&gt; is the group of complex  &lt;math&gt;(2 \times 2) &lt;/math&gt; matrices with unit determinant.

The '''Poincaré algebra''' is the [[Lie algebra]] of the Poincaré group. It is a [[Lie algebra extension#By semidirect sum|Lie algebra extension]] of the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group. More specifically, the proper (det''Λ''=1), [[Lorentz group#Connected components|orthochronous]] ({{math|''Λ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;≥1}}) part of the Lorentz subgroup (its [[identity component]]), SO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(1, 3),  is connected to the identity and is thus provided by the [[Exponential_map_(Lie_theory)|exponentiation]]  {{math|exp(''ia&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;'') exp(''iω&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;μν&lt;/sup&gt;''/2)}} of this [[Lie algebra]].  In component form, the Poincaré algebra is given by the commutation relations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=General Principles of Quantum Field Theory |author=N.N.

where {{mvar|P}} is the [[Lie group#The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group|generator]] of translations, {{mvar|M}} is the generator of Lorentz transformations, and {{mvar|η }} is the (+,−,−,−) Minkowski metric (see [[Sign convention]]).

The bottom commutation relation is the ("homogeneous") Lorentz group, consisting of rotations, {{math|''J&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''ϵ&lt;sub&gt;imn&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;mn&lt;/sup&gt;''/2}}, and boosts, {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''M&lt;sub&gt;i0&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.  In this notation, the entire Poincaré algebra is expressible in noncovariant (but more practical) language as
: &lt;math&gt;[J_m,P_n] = i \epsilon_{mnk} P_k ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[J_i,P_0] =  0 ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[K_i,P_k] = i \eta_{ik} P_0 ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[K_i,P_0] = -i P_i ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[J_m,J_n] = i \epsilon_{mnk} J_k ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[J_m,K_n] = i \epsilon_{mnk} K_k ~,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[K_m,K_n] = -i \epsilon_{mnk} J_k  ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where the bottom line commutator of two boosts is often referred to as a "Wigner rotation".  Note the important simplification {{math|[''J&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;+i K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; ,  J&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;−i K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''] {{=}} 0}},  which permits reduction of the Lorentz subalgebra to '''su(2)'''⊕'''su(2)''' and efficient treatment of its associated [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|representations]].

The [[Casimir invariant]]s of this algebra are {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;''P''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''W''&lt;sup&gt;''μ''&lt;/sup&gt;}} where {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;''μ''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Pauli–Lubanski pseudovector]]; they serve as labels for the representations of the group.
 
The Poincaré group is the full symmetry group of any [[relativistic field theory]]. As a result, all [[elementary particle]]s fall in [[Wigner's classification|representations of this group]]. These are usually specified by the ''four-momentum'' squared of each particle (i.e. its mass squared) and the intrinsic [[quantum number]]s {{math|''J&lt;sup&gt;PC&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, where {{mvar|J}} is the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] quantum number, {{mvar|P}} is the [[Parity (physics)|parity]] and {{mvar|C}} is the [[Charge conjugation|charge-conjugation]] quantum number. In practice, charge conjugation and parity are violated by many [[Quantum field theory|quantum field theories]]; where this occurs, {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|C}} are forfeited. Since [[CPT symmetry]] is [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] in quantum field theory, a [[T-parity|time-reversal quantum number]] may be constructed from those given.

As a [[topological space]], the group has four connected components: the component of the identity; the time reversed component; the spatial inversion component; and the component which is both time-reversed and spatially inverted.

== Other dimensions ==
The definitions above can be generalized to arbitrary dimensions in a straightforward manner. The d-dimensional Poincaré group is analogously defined by the semi-direct product

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IO}(1,d-1) := \mathbf{R}^{1,d-1} \rtimes \mathrm{O}(1,d-1) &lt;/math&gt;

with the analogous multiplication

:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha, f) \cdot (\beta, g) = (\alpha + f \cdot \beta, \; f \cdot g)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Lie algebra retains its form, with indices {{mvar|µ}} and {{mvar|ν}} now taking values between {{math|0}} and {{math|d-1}}. The alternative representation in terms of {{math|''J&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} has no analogue in higher dimensions.

==Super-Poincaré algebra==
A related observation is that the [[representations of the Lorentz group]] include a pair of inequivalent two-dimensional complex spinor representations &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{2}&lt;/math&gt; whose [[tensor product]] &lt;math&gt;2\otimes\overline{2}=3\oplus1&lt;/math&gt; is the [[adjoint representation]]. One may identify this last bit with four-dimensional Minkowski space itself (as opposed to identifying it with a spin-1 particle, as would normally be done for a pair of [[fermion]]s, e.g. a [[pion]] being composed of a [[quark]]-anti-quark pair). This strongly suggests that it might be possible to extend the Poincaré algebra to also include spinors. This leads directly to the notion of the [[super-Poincaré algebra]]. The mathematical appeal of this idea is that one is working with the [[fundamental representation]]s, instead of the adjoint representations.  The physical appeal of this idea is that the fundamental representations correspond to [[fermion]]s, which are seen in nature. So far, however, the implied [[supersymmetry]] here, of a symmetry between spatial and fermionic directions, cannot be seen experimentally in nature.  The experimental issue can roughly be stated as the question: if we live in the adjoint representation (Minkowski spacetime), then where is the fundamental representation hiding?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2227">The '''reveal''' (also known as the '''big reveal''') is a [[plot device]] in [[narrative structure]], and is the exposure to the reader or audience of a previously unseen key character or element of [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] or of the [[performance]].

A reveal is different from Aristotle's ''[[anagnorisis]]'', in which something is revealed to a character rather than to the audience.

==Narrative==
The reveal may result in a [[plot twist]], and could be the key plot turn or unexpected [[Post-credits scene|coda]] in the story – in the [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] [[Literary genre|genre]], for example. It may also be used as a device (particularly in the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]]) in [[stage magic]] by an [[Magic (illusion)|illusionist]] or [[escape artist]].&lt;ref name=Clark_2012&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, James L. |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mekGtpHh5zUC&amp;pg=PT159&amp;dq=%22the+reveal%22+magic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Qgz7T-bhF4uZiAfklsmABw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20reveal%22&amp;f=false |chapter=Performing the Corkscrew |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd |title=Mind Magic and Mentalism for Dummies |accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stage magic ==
In a magician's act, "the reveal" may refer to&lt;ref name=Clark_2012/&gt;
* the normal culmination of a trick
* the unexpected (to the [[audience]]) culmination of the trick
* an explanation of the trick – which itself may be immediately eclipsed by a version of the trick that the first reveal can't explain.

==Film==
''Reveal'' is also used for two distinct cinematographic techniques:
* A slow, theatrically presented image of an important character or item not seen previously in the film;
* A close-up, wide shot, or other unusual camera point-of-view that shows the audience an important visual clue not known to characters in the same scene.

In the sense of first-time showing of a character, a ''reveal'' is similar to, but usually not same as, the [[opening shot]] or [[Establishing shot]] that gives the location or context of a new scene.

The '''Romanian Athenaeum''' ({{lang-ro|Ateneul Român}}) is a [[concert hall]] in the center of [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]] and a landmark of the Romanian capital city. Opened in 1888, the ornate, domed, circular building is the city's main concert hall and home of the [[George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra|"George Enescu" Philharmonic]] and of the [[George Enescu]] annual international music festival.

== History ==

In 1865, cultural and scientific personalities such as [[Constantin Esarcu]], [[V. A. Urechia]], and [[Nicolae Creţulescu]] founded the Romanian Atheneum Cultural Society.  To serve its purposes, the Romanian Athenaeum, a building dedicated to art and science, would be erected in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fge.org.ro/ateneul-roman/ The Romanian Athenaeum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107042923/http://fge.org.ro/ateneul-roman/ |date=2008-01-07 }} on the official site of the George Enescu Philarmonic&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was designed by the [[France|French]] architect [[Albert Galleron]], built on a property that had belonged to the [[Văcărescu family]] and inaugurated in 1888, although work continued until 1897.  A portion of the construction funds was raised by public subscription in a 28-year-long effort, of which the slogan is still remembered today: "Donate one ''[[Romanian leu|leu]]'' for the ''Ateneu''!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotel-bucuresti.com/blog/2015/05/14/ateneul-roman-un-simbol-al-culturii-romanesti/ Page about the Romanian Athenaeum] provides a detailed description of the scenes from Romanian history portrayed in the frescoes of the Atheneum. {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 1919, the Atheneum was the site of the conference of leading Romanians who voted to ratify the unification of [[Bessarabia]], [[Transylvania]], and [[Bukovina]] with the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] to constitute [[Greater Romania]].

Extensive reconstruction and restoration work has been conducted in 1992 by a Romanian construction company and restoration painter Silviu Petrescu, saving the building from collapse.  The 9 million Euro required were contributed in equal shares by the government and the [[Council of Europe|Council of Europe Development Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructiv.ro/arhiva/2003/06_iunie/curent_cuprins1.html 1992 reconstruction work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041107040331/http://www.constructiv.ro/arhiva/2003/06_iunie/curent_cuprins1.html |date=2004-11-07 }} includes an excellent image of the inside of the dome during construction. {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flickr - fusion-of-horizons - Ateneul Român (4).jpg|300px|thumb|right|Romanian Athenaeum]]
The overall style is [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]], with some more [[Romanticism|romantic]] touches.  In front of the building there is a small park and a statue of Romanian poet [[Mihai Eminescu]].

Inside, the ground floor hosts an ornate conference hall as large as the [[auditorium]] above; the auditorium seats 600 in the stalls and another 52 in loge seating.

A 75-sqm long and 3-m wide [[fresco]] by [[Costin Petrescu (painter)|Costin Petrescu]] decorates the inside of the circular wall of the concert hall.  Painted using the ''al fresco'' technique, the piece depicts the most important moments of Romanian history, starting with the conquest of [[Dacia]] by Roman emperor [[Trajan]] and ending with the realization of [[Greater Romania]] in 1918.

Recognized as a symbol of Romanian culture, the building has been inscribed in 2007 on the list of the [[European Heritage Label|Label of European Heritage]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nato.mae.ro/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=31&amp;s=23698&amp;arhiva=true Romanian Athenaeum awarded Label of European Heritage], Romania's Permanent Delegation to NATO&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rucellai Sepulchre''' is a small funerary chapel built inside the Rucellai Chapel of the church of [[San Pancrazio, Florence]]. It was commissioned by [[Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai]] and built to designs by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] in imitation or emulation of the Holy Sepulchre in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Anastasis]] in [[Jerusalem]]. It contains the tombs of Giovanni Rucellai and members of his family.&lt;ref name=comune/&gt;

==Names==
The Rucellai sepulchre is known by various names, including Sacellum of the Holy Sepulchre, Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre, [[Italian language|Italian]]: {{lang|it|Tempietto del Santo Sepolcro}}, {{lang|it|Sacello del Santo Sepolcro}} and {{lang|it|Tempietto Rucellai}}.

==History==
Alberti's work on the Rucellai Chapel and on the sepulchre within it probably began in about 1458;&lt;ref name=rab/&gt; the origins of the chapel date to 1417, when the walls of the nave of San Pancrazio were built. According to the inscription above the door, the Sepulchre was completed in 1467.

==Description==

===Inscriptions===
The sepulchre has two inscriptions: one, on a square panel above the door, reads:
{|
| width="34pt"| || IOHANNES RVCELLARIVS
|-
|  ||style="font-size: 87%;"| PAVLI ‧F‧ VT INDE SALVTEM SVAM
|-
|  ||style="font-size: 87%;"|  PRECARETVR VNDE OMNIVM CVM
|-
|  ||style="font-size: 87%;"|  CHRISTO FACTA EST RESVRECTIO
|-
|  || SACELLVM HOC
|-
|    ||style="font-size: 87%;"| ADĪSTAR HIEROSOLIMITANI SEPVL
|-
|   ||style="font-size: 87%;"|  CHRI FACIVNDVM CVRAVIT
|-
|   || style="padding-left: 1em" | MCCCCLXVII
|}

meaning approximately "Giovanni di Paolo Rucellai, in order that his salvation might be prayed for from where, through Christ, the resurrection of all was achieved, had this temple built in the shape of the tomb in Jerusalem [in] 1467".

The other inscription runs round the top of the building and reads:

{{quote|YHESVM QVERITIS NAZARENVM CRVCIFIXVM SURREXIT NON EST HIC ECCE LOCVS VBI POSVERVNT EVM}}

The '''South Street Headhouse District'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southstreet.com|title=South Street Headhouse District}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also referred to as '''South Street''', even though it also includes Pine Street and only spans the streets east of Broad Street&lt;ref name=sshd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southstreet.com/businesses/map-of-the-district/|title=Map of South Street Headhouse District}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Philadelphia]] is an area with more than 300 stores  which includes a diverse urban mix of shops, bars and eateries.  The neighborhood is generally bounded between Front Street and Seventh Street and includes Pine Street and is known for its "[[Bohemianism|bohemian]]", "[[Punk subculture|punk]]", and generally "[[Alternative lifestyles|alternative]]" atmosphere.  It is one of Philadelphia's largest tourist attractions.&lt;ref name="tourist"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120616031722/http://press.visitphilly.com/releases/what-s-in-the-south-street-neighborhood What's In The South Street Neighborhood?] (archived), [[Visitphilly.com]] Accessed August 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Demographics==
In 2014, the area's population was 27,805.  The average age for the neighborhood is 34.9, with 57.44% of the population between the ages of 18 to 44 and 62.3% of the population are renters with the average income of $71,856.&lt;ref name=sshd2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southstreet.com/businesses/key-facts-demographics/|title=Key Facts &amp; Demographics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to City Data, the area has 1,248 males and 1,196 females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/South-Street-Philadelphia-PA.html|title=South Street Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==

The district spans the following areas:&lt;ref name=sshd2/&gt;
* [[South Street (Philadelphia)|South Street]] from [[Front Street (Philadelphia)|Front]] to [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad]].  Some sources also say that the neighborhood has begun to expand west from here since 2014.  Traditionally, the original neighborhood only existed from Front to 7th.  The limit as of 2017 is 11th Street
* Pine Street at 2nd ([[Head House Square]])
* [[Lombard Street (Philadelphia)|Lombard Street]] between Front and 3rd
* Kater Street
* 4th Street down to Catherine Street ([[Fabric Row]])
* Passyunk Avenue south to Fitzwater

The neighborhood significantly overlaps with [[Queen Village, Philadelphia|Queen Village]], [[Washington Square West, Philadelphia|Washington Square West]], [[Bella Vista, Philadelphia|Bella Vista]], and [[Society Hill, Philadelphia|Society Hill]].

==History==
{{seealso|South Street (Philadelphia)}}Originally the southern border of William Penn's 1682 city plan and officially named Cedar Street until 1854&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/philadelphia/formerstreets.htm|title=Philadelphia History: Old Street Names.|website=www.ushistory.org|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, eastern South Street has been the center of local Swedish, Dutch, Jewish, Irish, and Italian immigrant culture as well as a vibrant [[African-American neighborhood]] beginning in the early 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/south-street/|title=South Street {{!}} Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|website=philadelphiaencyclopedia.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Quaker doctrine opposed live performances within the city limits, the first permanent theater in America was built on the south side of the street at Leithgow Street&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hiddencityphila.org/2012/01/hippest-street-in-town-circa-1766/|title=Hippest Street In Town, Circa 1766 {{!}} Hidden City Philadelphia|website=hiddencityphila.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, giving birth to a tradition of Philadelphians seeking out entertainment on South Street that continues today.

In 1854, the same year that South Street officially became South Street, the city boundaries were redrawn to expand the area of Philadelphia to 130 square miles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/consolidation-act-of-1854/|title=Consolidation Act of 1854 {{!}} Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|website=philadelphiaencyclopedia.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite no longer being a literal border, South Street remained a liminal space where cultures collided. The African-American theater district of western South Street, the Jewish shops, nearby Italian businesses, and visitors from other parts of the city combined to create a place described by [[William Gardner Smith]] in his 1954 book ''South Street'' as a lively zone of contact between many different ethnicities. [[File:NW Corner South St and Front Philly.JPG|220px|right|thumb|Corner of South and Front]]
From the early 1960s to the 1970s, South Street was filled with clubs and bars that fostered a growing nightlife. During this time, the neighborhood also served as an artists' haven and a hub of [[Beat Generation|Beat subculture]] and, later, [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]], [[bohemianism]], and the [[hippie movement]] in Philadelphia, establishing a lasting association of South Street with [[avant-garde]] and [[alternative culture|alternative subcultures]].&lt;ref name="icons"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I6Iii1MNkXoC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+punk+scene&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDyuqXqu7LAhXIZCYKHXmWB2A4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20punk%20scene&amp;f=false|title=Philadelphia Icons: 50 Classic Views of the City of Brotherly Love|last1=Ivory|first1=Karen|date=2011|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frommers"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WR5OAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=south+street+philadelphia+artists+bohemian&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+artists+bohemian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbyJLarO7LAhWEMSYKHecyDf8Q6AEIOzAF|title=Frommer's Philadelphia &amp; the Amish Country|last1=McCutcheon|first1=Lauren|date=2009|publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keech"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beMxAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+hippie&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCyoDiq-7LAhUKNSYKHcIHDPsQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20hippie&amp;f=false|title=The Best Flea, Antique, Vintage, and New-Style Markets in America|last1=Keech|first1=Pamela|date=2013|publisher=New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mann"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASTKVQDpbYYC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+hippie&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCyoDiq-7LAhUKNSYKHcIHDPsQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20hippie&amp;f=false|title=Blinded by the Lyrics: Behind the Lines of Rock and Roll's Most Baffling Songs|last1=Mann|first1=Brett|date=2005|publisher=Citadel Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMHcDciM3kMC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+hippie&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCyoDiq-7LAhUKNSYKHcIHDPsQ6AEIUTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20hippie&amp;f=false|title=Black Citymakers: How The Philadelphia Negro Changed Urban America|last1=Hunter|first1=Marcus Anthony|date=2013|publisher=OUP USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was not uncommon for South Philadelphians to "[[bar hopping|bar-hop]]" across the clubs, listening to live bands along the way. This community of fans helped attract recording contracts for many artists, including [[Kenn Kweder]], the "bard of South Street"; [[George Thorogood]]; and [[Robert Hazard]]. From the mid to late 1970s into the 1980s, South Street's reputation as a musical, artistic, and [[countercultural]] hub was further solidified as it became the center of Philadelphia's [[punk scene]] and [[punk rock|punk]] and [[alternative rock]] music communities, with venues such as JC Dobbs and stores such as Zipperhead catering to the burgeoning scene.&lt;ref name="amorosi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amorosi|first1=A.D.|title=Where They Were Then|url=http://citypaper.net/articles/2002-10-17/cover3.shtml|website=Philadelphia City Paper|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laird"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laird|first1=R.F.|title=The Boomer Bible|date=1991|publisher=Workman Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-IT-INLWzkC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+punk+scene&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTp4n1qO7LAhUDQyYKHXGeArwQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20punk%20scene&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ivory"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ivory|first1=Karen|title=Philadelphia Off the Beaten Path: A Guide to Unique Places|date=2007|publisher=Globe Pequot|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k7VhpHPjcscC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=south+street+philadelphia+punk+scene&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTp4n1qO7LAhUDQyYKHXGeArwQ6AEIRjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20street%20philadelphia%20punk%20scene&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1976, [[Jim's Steaks]] of [[West Philadelphia]]  expanded to 400 South Street, becoming the notable restaurant's first franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jimssteaks.com/jim-s-steaks--history.html|title=Jim's Steaks History|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, South Street became one of the city's main tourist attractions anchored by the [[Theatre of Living Arts]] (TLA) which began as an [[Art film|arthouse]] theater and then was reborn as a live music venue. Tourists flocked to the South Street's nightlife and the "neighborhood" community aspect was gradually lost.

South Street remains a popular hangout area for teens, college students, and [[twentysomething (term)|twentysomethings]] with its assortment of bars, [[take-out]] eateries, [[sex shop]]s, gift shops, and retailers catering to [[hip hop fashion]], [[punk fashion]], and/or [[urban culture]].  A few restaurants and independent [[boutique]]s targeting a slightly more mature clientele are interspersed with these businesses, such as Accent on Animals, a pet supply store, and South Street Souvlaki, a Greek restaurant. Starting in the late 1990s, the street saw the establishment of various [[chain store]]s, including [[Johnny Rockets]], two [[Starbucks]] locations, [[Häagen-Dazs]], [[Rita's Italian Ice]], [[Super Fresh]], [[Whole Foods]], [[CVS Pharmacy|CVS]], and [[Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board|Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits]].  South Street is adjacent to [[Headhouse Square]], a notable plaza with various shops and restaurants.

Artist [[Isaiah Zagar]] has made South Street his home since the late 1960s and his mosaic work can be seen in multiple places along South Street including his large installation [[Philadelphia's Magic Gardens]] between 10th Street and 11th Street.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Zipperhead south street philly.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Zipperhead (now relocated and changed name) was mentioned in the song "Punk Rock Girl" by the [[Dead Milkmen]].]]
[[The Orlons]], a music group from Philadelphia, released a 1963 song based on (and entitled) South Street, which begins with the line "Where do all the hippies meet?"  Another Philadelphia-area band, [[The Dovells]] also mentioned South Street in their 1963 hit "[[You Can't Sit Down]]".

Philadelphia band [[Need New Body]] has a song called "So St RX" which is about South Street.

[[Fear (band)|Fear]]'s 1982 song "[[The Record (album)|I Don't Care About You]]", which name-checks the neighborhoods associated with the punk movement in the United States in the early 1980s, begins with the line, "I'm from South Street Philadelphia" (also relevant to writer/vocalist [[Lee Ving]] who was born in the city).

[[The Dead Milkmen]]'s 1988 song "Punk Rock Girl" makes references to Zipperhead (a punk rock/alternative clothing and accessories store) and The Philadelphia Pizza Company., Ltd, both of which were located on South Street. Portions of the video for this song were filmed on South Street. Zipperhead has since relocated to South 4th St. and been renamed to Crash Bang Boom. A few years after Zipperhead founder and building landlord Rick Millan sold the business to local musician Rob Windfelder of the rock band Live Not On Evil and his business partner Stefanie Jollis, the store was relocated and renamed.

[[Green Day]] made their Philadelphia debut on January 23, 1993 at J.C. Dobbs on the 300 block of South Street. The band had not yet signed with Reprise and the club oversold the 125-capacity venue. Late arrivals paid to enter the second floor and watch the live video feed. During the third song of the set, a young woman had a seizure, the show was halted, and police ended the concert and cleared the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pearn Jr.|first=Frank |date=January 23, 1993|title=Philadelphia Police Seize The Moment At Dobbs |url=http://articles.mcall.com/1993-01-23/entertainment/2906403_1_green-day-dobbs-punk-rock|newspaper=The Morning Call|location=Allentown|publisher= |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boyz II Men]]'s debut song and video "[[Motownphilly]]" was partially filmed on South Street and the location is referenced in the song.

Singer songwriter Jake Laufer's 2009 rockabilly song, "Center City," about a guy from Tennessee coming north to meet up with his Philly-based girlfriend, features several South Street landmarks, including Lorenzo's Pizza and Famous 4th Street Deli.

[[File:WTP C20 AMP 1.jpg|300px|left|thumb|The Theater of the Living Arts]]
The [[Home Box Office|HBO]] comedy special ''[[The Diceman Cometh]]'', starring comedian [[Andrew Dice Clay]], was recorded at South Street's [[Theater of the Living Arts]] (and was mentioned in the special by Clay).

The block of South Street between 5th and 6th Street is shown in the opening credits of the FX Network show "[[It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia]]".

Philadelphia native [[Will Smith]] makes mention in his song "Getting Jiggy with it" in the lyric "livin' that life some consider a myth,
rock from south street to one two fifth".

==Education==
South Street is served by the [[William M. Meredith School]].

"'''Surf City'''" is a song written by [[Brian Wilson]] and [[Jan Berry]] about a fictitious surf spot where there are "two girls for every boy."&lt;ref name="Barres1996"/&gt; It was first recorded and made popular by the American duo [[Jan and Dean]] in 1963, and their single became the first surf song to become a national number-one hit.&lt;ref name="Marcus2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marcus|first=Ben|title=Surfing: An Illustrated History of the Coolest Sport of All Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcMuBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92https%3A%2F%2Fbooks.google.com%2Fbooks%3Fid%3Dg4XoilnqtjkC|year=2013|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-61058-761-7|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, after moving to [[Huntington Beach, California]], [[Dean Torrence]] helped convince elected officials that the town be officially nicknamed [[Surf City, USA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Michael|title=Two Bites for Everyone|url=http://articles.hbindependent.com/2011-04-26/news/tn-hbi-0428-happs-20110426_1_taste-of-huntington-beach-dean-torrence-matt-liffreing|work=[[The Independent]]|date=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, the official trademark of "surf City, USA" was granted to Huntington Beach after several back-and-forth lawsuits between Huntington Beach and Santa Cruz. As of 2009, more than 65 businesses in the city included "Surf City" as part of their name.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Jan and Dean version==
The first draft of the song, with the working title "Goody Connie Won't You Come Back Home", was written by Brian Wilson of [[the Beach Boys]].&lt;ref name="Lambert2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=Philip|title=Inside the Music of Brian Wilson: The Songs, Sounds, and Influences of the Beach Boys' Founding Genius|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3sGoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81|date=19 March 2007|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-0748-0|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at a party with [[Jan and Dean|Jan Berry and Dean Torrence]], Wilson played them "[[Surfin' U.S.A.]]" on the piano. Berry and Torrence suggested that they do the song as a single, but Wilson refused, as "Surfin' U.S.A." was intended for the Beach Boys. Wilson then suggested that the duo record "Surf City" instead, demoing the opening, verse, and chorus.&lt;ref name="Preiss1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Preiss|first=Byron|authorlink=Byron Preiss|title=The Beach Boys|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I0dWoXNvhkoC|year=1979|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=978-0-345-27398-7|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson had lost interest in the song and believed he was never going to complete it himself.&lt;ref name="Badman2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Badman|first=Keith|title=The Beach Boys: The Definitive Diary of America's Greatest Band, on Stage and in the Studio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sLEMdjRhDgQC&amp;pg=PA39|year=2004|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=978-0-87930-818-6|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berry later contributed additional writing to the song,&lt;ref name="Barres1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barres|first=Pamela Des|title=Rock Bottom: Dark Moments in Music Babylon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iHmPCHZM-9wC&amp;pg=PA13|year=1996|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-14853-9|page=13|chapter=Riding the Wild Surf to Deadman's Cove}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Torrence also contributed several phrases, but never insisted that he be given writing credit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

[[Hal Blaine]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Earl Palmer]], [[Bill Pitman]], Ray Pohlman and [[Billy Strange]] are identified as players for the single per the [[American Federation of Musicians]] contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wreckingcrewfilm.com/afmcontracts/Jan+Dean_SurfCity.pdf |title=Phonograph Recording Contract |publisher=[[American Federation of Musicians]] |website=The Wrecking Crew |accessdate=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released in May 1963, two months later it became the first surf song to reach number one on national record charts, remaining at the top of [[Billboard Hot 100]] for two weeks.&lt;ref name="Marcus2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Badman2004"/&gt;  The single crossed over to the ''Billboard'' [[R&amp;B Chart]] where it peaked at number 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also charted in the UK, reaching number 26.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/9808/jan-and-dean/ UK Official Charts Archive, 21 August 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the single, Jan and Dean made music which was largely inspired by East Coast black vocal group records. The success of "Surf City" gave them a unique sound and identity which would be followed by five more top ten hits inspired by Los Angeles surf or hot rod life.&lt;ref name="Gillett2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillett|first=Charlie |title=The Sound of the City: The Rise of Rock &amp; Roll|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mx-nAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR8-IA71|year=2011|publisher=Souvenir Press Limited|isbn=978-0-285-64024-5|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beach Boys' manager and Wilson's father [[Murry Wilson|Murry]] was reportedly irate about the song, believing that Brian had wasted a number one record which could have gone to his group, the Beach Boys. Brian later told ''[[Teen Beat]]'', "I was proud of the fact that another group had had a number 1 track with a song I had written ... But dad would hear none of it. ... He called Jan a 'record pirate'."&lt;ref name="Badman2004"/&gt;

'''''The Actor (L'acteur)''''' is a 1904 [[painting]] by Spanish painter [[Pablo Picasso]], one of the most recognized figures in [[20th-century art]].&lt;ref name=afp /&gt;

==Background==
Picasso painted ''The Actor'' during the winter of 1904–1905 when he was 23 years old.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; The painting is a work of the artist's [[Picasso's Rose Period|Rose Period]] when he changed his painting style from the downbeat tones of his [[Picasso's Blue Period|Blue Period]] to warmer and more romantic hues.&lt;ref name=afp /&gt; Picasso painted ''The Actor'' on the reverse side of a landscape painting by another artist because he could not afford new canvases at the time.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; From 1912 to June 1938 the painting was owned by Alice and Paul Friedrich Leffmann, originally of Cologne. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/488690|title=Pablo Picasso {{!}} The Actor {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;The painting currently resides in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]]. It was donated to the museum in 1952 by automobile heiress [[Thelma Chrysler Foy]], daughter of [[Walter Chrysler]], the founder of the [[Chrysler]] automobile company.&lt;ref name=afp&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2010-01-25 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100125/ts_alt_afp/usartaccidentpicasso |title=New York woman falls, rips Picasso painting |publisher=Agence France-Presse |date=2010-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128094101/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100125/ts_alt_afp/usartaccidentpicasso |archivedate=January 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts estimate that the painting, which is one of the largest from Picasso's Rose Period, is worth more than US$100 million.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2010-01-25 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/arts/design/26picasso.html |title=Questions Over Fixing Torn Picasso  |work=The New York Times |date=2010-01-25 |author=Vogel, Carol }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==
The painting portrays an [[Acrobatics|acrobat]] in a dramatic pose with an abstract design in the background. The canvas measures {{convert|196|cm|in}} by {{convert|115|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name=afp /&gt;

==Damage==
''The Actor'' was damaged on January 25, 2010 when a woman attending an [[Art education|art class]] stumbled and fell into the painting, creating a rip of about {{convert|15|cm|in}} in height in the lower right corner. The museum stated that the rip did not affect the artwork's central subject. They also indicated that they intend to have the painting repaired in a few weeks by performing "unobtrusive" work. This was in preparation for an April 27 retrospective of roughly 250 of the artist's works.&lt;ref name=afp /&gt;

'''The Center for Art in Wood''' is an American educational [[wood art]] institution located in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. It was officially established as a nonprofit in 1986 by brothers Albert and Alan LeCoff, following a series of international symposium from 1976-1986 presented by the LeCoff's with woodturner Palmer Sharpless.  The organization operated as the Wood Turning Center until 2011, when the nonprofit moved to its current location in [[Old City, Philadelphia|Old City District of Philadelphia]] and changed its name to The Center for Art in Wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/10/10/garden/philadelphia-design.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=Four Square Blocks: Philadelphia|accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Center presents changing exhibitions of contemporary art work in the medium of wood, a permanent collection of over 1,000 pieces and a host of educational programs and workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigmagazine.com/big-philadelphia/38|work=Big Magazine|title=The Center for Art in Wood|accessdate=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center also houses a research library, artists files, and a museum store.  A series of publications documents the Center's work and highlights premier artists working in the field of [[wood turning]] and art in wood.

'''''ToryBoy The Movie''''' is a 2011 [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]]-style British documentary feature film directed by and starring [[John Walsh (filmmaker)|John Walsh]]. It follows Walsh as he becomes a political candidate for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the north east England constituency of [[Middlesbrough]]. 

==Background==
A staunch [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] supporter all his life, Walsh had become disillusioned with the party. When [[David Cameron]] opened the door to allow non party members to run for the Conservative candidacy ahead of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/5377839/David-Cameron-to-open-up-candidate-list-to-everyone.html|title=David Cameron to 'open up candidate list to everyone'|author=Chris Irvine|date=24 May 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Walsh decided to do just that and document his experiences on camera.&lt;ref name="Young People"&gt;[https://youngpeopleinpolitics.org.uk/inspiration/interviews/ John Walsh interview, Young People In Politics, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; He came third in the election; Stuart Bell remained the MP of Middlesbrough,&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-13960870|title=Tory Boy takes on Sir Stuart Bell in documentary film|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but increased the Conservative vote to its highest in thirty years with an 18.8% share of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/c92.stm|title=BBC News - Election 2010 - Constituency - Middlesbrough|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The film==
The film was based on the 72 hours of footage made by Walsh on the campaign trail.&lt;ref name="Young People"/&gt; It made the case that [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s [[Stuart Bell]] should not be the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) of [[Middlesbrough]], as Bell was absent so often from Middlesbrough that he is an unsuitable candidate. Walsh showed the finished film in a free showing a year after the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/toryboy-movie-documentary-up-award-3691723|title=Toryboy The Movie documentary up for award|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=5 August 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the ''Who Can I vote For?'' website a humorous warning is given, "this film contains strong language throughout and scenes of politicians that some viewers may find offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/person/493/john-walsh|title=John Walsh for Member of Parliament for Middlesbrough in the 2010 General Election|website=Who Can I Vote For? by Democracy Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Amesbury]] appeared in the documentary protesting outside the Conservative conference in Manchester.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

Walsh paid homage to the great title designer [[Saul Bass]] and recreated his angular animations to create a fresh approach to telling this story. “This map cap comedy best captured the visual style and the transition of the film was making from a serious expose of the political shenanigans in the North East, to a political satire.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewhitebalance.com/work/toryboy-the-movie.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh said that he took a risk making this film in an article with Digital Journal "For something like this, an investigative film, there will be some who think that I have exceeded my brief as a candidate. I would say that it is right to look at injustice and in this country people have died so that we may all have the right to question those in authority and those in public office."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaljournal.com/blog/11509&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Northern Echo]]'' discussed the possible of the film forcing a new by election as a result of its findings. Walsh said he had been serious about becoming an MP and had self-funded his £15,000 election campaign. "When I got to Middlesbrough I found a town that politics had forgotten and a MP who was there in name only, a truly depressingly affair.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9028657.Documentary__could_force_by_election_/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The film received positive reviews, with a high score of 8.8 on [[IMDb]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740117/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2011 the film was nominated for the [[Grierson Awards]] for "Best Documentary on a Contemporary Theme".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.griersontrust.org/grierson-awards/past-awards/2011/the-grierson-awards-2011-shortlist/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://lfs.org.uk/content/john-walshs-tory-boy-movie-shortlisted-grierson-awards&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Radio Times]]'' film review by Jeremy Aspinall on the film's re-release gave it four stars, and called it "A revealing and droll fly-on-the-wall documentary. It's a fascinating odyssey illuminated by pithily informative animations. Who would have thought politics could be so entertaining?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/c5xq27/toryboy-the-movie|title=Toryboy the Movie|author=Jeremy Aspinall|work=RadioTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Details of the film's award nomination was covered by the Middlesbrough ''[[Teesside Gazette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/toryboy-movie-documentary-up-award-3691723&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Irish Post]]'' Walsh’s “documentary about a rookie Conservative candidate aimed to provide an insight into British political culture, and in doing so uncovered the next big political scandal.” &lt;ref&gt;http://irishpost.co.uk/documentary-that-exposed-labour-scandal-back-in-theatres-ahead-of-election/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard Moss]], the [[BBC]]'s North East &amp; Cumbria Political editor, "some silliness aside, it is a thought-provoking insight into the way our political system works or doesn't work on the ground... But I'm not sure he quite nails down a case against Stuart Bell.. And John Walsh doesn't help his case with some of the content in the film."&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; [[Liberal Democratic Party|Liberal Democrat]] commentator Mark Pack wrote on his blog that "John Walsh portrays life on the campaign trail as it really is. It is a hugely enjoyable documentary, which mixes humour, drama and education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markpack.org.uk/29694/toryboy-john-walsh-portrays-life-on-the-campaign-trail-as-it-really-is/|title=ToryBoy: John Walsh portrays life on the campaign trail as it really is|date=1 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A screening at the [[Frontline Club]] took place on 22 November 2011 followed by a Q&amp;A with John Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontlineclub.com/toryboy_visits_the_frontline_club/|title=ToryBoy visits the Frontline Club|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire Magazine]]'' gave it three stars and called it a "shit stirring exposé of local politics that will make you cross".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=510147455692929&amp;set=pb.191458757561802.-2207520000.1384175778.&amp;type=3&amp;theater screenshot at Facebook] 20 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2017}} Samuel Scott from review site DVD Compare gave it a B- and wrote "I found this documentary very intriguing and very honest. John is a very likable character, and I wouldn't hesitate in voting for someone with so much passion for a second."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dvdcompare.net/review.php?rid=3637 DVD Compare] 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Doc Geeks commented that the film was "a blunt exposé combined with a tinge of lightheartedness. Satirical animation cleverly frames Britain in its political context".&lt;ref&gt;[http://docgeeks.com/2011/11/14/review-toryboy-the-movie/ Doc Geeks] November 14th, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, novelist [[Christopher Fowler]] wrote that ''ToryBoy The Movie'' was "a snapshot of our country’s political apathy in microcosm. It’s heartbreaking to see people blindly supporting their own demise as if they’re playing some kind of long game they’ll probably never live to see the outcome of. Oh, and it’s also very funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christopherfowler.co.uk/blog/2011/12/02/review-toryboy/|title=Re:View – ‘Toryboy’ - Christopher Fowler|website=www.christopherfowler.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the DVD was released Ben Kamal interviewed Walsh for the Aberdeen student newspaper ''[[Gaudie]]'', and wrote "I was prepared for some careful sneering in the interview and subsequent write-up. This did not (and could not) transpire: firstly because of the film, which comes across as [[Frank Capra]] scripted by [[Evelyn Waugh]]; secondly because of Walsh himself. He is warm, patient and generous, to my own shock I liked him and if you watch the film you'll like him too."&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/gaudie/docs/feb_25] 25 February 2014, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; "Dave", a reviewer at the website 60 Minutes With, wrote "''ToryBoy the Movie'' is a fantastic documentary and one in which you will be cheering for John despite what political party you follow. His journey from his Labour roots through to a Tory campaign is superbly documented and will have you both laughing and feeling his frustration in equal measure."&lt;ref&gt;[http://60minuteswith.co.uk/reviews/review-toryboy-movie/ 60 Minutes With], 15 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Northern Echo]]'' article by Lucy Richardson she reveals that “at the pre-election hustings, where Sir Stuart does not make an appearance, he tells voters that he will have Sir Stuart jailed before Christmas if elected.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/9120025.Jolt_from_the_blue/&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after the film release, Lord [[Michael Ashcroft]] wrote on his blog: "I’d defy anyone with an interest in politics not to enjoy this film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2012/05/lord-ashcroft-two-years-on-a-controversial-film-gives-a-witty-thought-provoking-snapshot-into-the-ge.html|title=Lord Ashcroft: Two years on, a controversial film gives a witty, thought-provoking snapshot into the general election|work=Conservative Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say that "despite the zany tone of the film, it also has a hard-hitting message which questions whether one MP in his safe seat, and perhaps other MPs in similar situations, do enough to justify their salary and expenses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lordashcroft.com/2012/05/two-years-on-a-controversial-film-gives-a-witty-thought-provoking-snapshot-into-the-general-election/|title=Two years on, a controversial film gives a witty, thought-provoking snapshot into the general election - Lord Ashcroft|date=6 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 the political Guido Fawkes website also known as Order Order, ran an article entitled “Inside The Greatest Election Scandal of All Time” says that Walsh “lifted the lid on the real-life world of political campaigning.”&lt;ref&gt;https://order-order.com/2017/04/28/inside-greatest-election-scandal-time/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vice (magazine)|Vice Mangazine]]’s Joe Zadeh’s article suggests a link between how Labour in Middlesbrough lost the votes of blue collar people and its shift to the right. He cited ToryBoy The Movie as an example of this shift.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev445j/how-labour-lost-the-working-class&lt;/ref&gt;

In a podcast interview with BritFlicks Walsh talks about ToryBoy and the difficulties in making the film and also his plans to develop lost [[Ray Harryhausen]] film projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://britflicks.com/blog.aspx?blogid=24084&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2018/01/01/interview-john-walsh-tory-boy-the-movie-ray-harryhausen-podcast/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Although not explicitly inspired by the film, Neil Macfarlane, in a report for local newspaper''[[Teesside Gazette]]'', asked "Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?" when he failed to answer over 100 telephone calls made to his constituency office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/teessiders-getting-enough-sir-stuart-3693031|title=Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=6 September 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gazette'' story was picked up by national newspapers. ''[[The Independent]]'' asked "is Sir Stuart Bell Britain's laziest MP?"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Brown [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/no-surgeries-for-14-years--is-sir-stuart-bell-britains-laziest-mp-2350953.html No surgeries for 14 years - is Sir Stuart Bell Britain's laziest MP?], ''Independent'', 7 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;Richard Moss [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14847291 Middlesbrough MP Sir Stuart Bell fights laziest MP tag], BBC, 9 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Guardian'' fact-checked the "laziest MP" claim and found that the laziest MP was [[Roger Godsiff]] but the report did confirm that Sir Stuart Bell did not maintain the pivotal role for a MP, an office in their constituency. &lt;ref name="reality check"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/sep/08/reality-check-britain-s-laziest-mp|title=Reality check: Who are Britain's laziest parliamentarians?|author=Polly Curtis|work=the Guardian|date=8 September 2011}}: "Bell has been an MP for nearly 30 years and has had a distinguished career in parliament as a frontbench spokesman on trade and industry in opposition and the spokesman for the Church of England in the House of Commons and member of the House of Commons commission until last year. He's part of a breed of politicians – also including the Tory [[Edward Leigh]] and Labour's [[Gerald Kaufman]] – who have been extremely active parliamentarians but not always maintained an office in their constituency. One measure of their parliamentary work is the proportion of votes they turn up to."&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party said it would be totally unacceptable if constituents had been unable to contact their MP. [[Ed Miliband]] and the Labour Party expect the highest standards from Labour representatives. It is totally unacceptable if the public cannot reach their MP.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/labour-launches-probe-middlesbrough-mp-3693109|title=Labour launches probe into Middlesbrough MP|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=8 September 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sir Stuart Bell did have a right of reply, which appeared in the short film ''ToryBoy The AfterMath''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2014/05/john-walsh-toryboy-the-aftermath-or-the-town-that-politics-forgot.html|title=John Walsh: ToryBoy – the aftermath (or: the Town That Politics Forgot…)|work=Conservative Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's expose nearly forced a By Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9028657.Documentary__could_force_by_election_/|title=Documentary 'could force by-election'|work=The Northern Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's re-release in 2015 caused more controversy after a showing in Middlesbrough by [[Teesside University]] was cancelled to avoid breaching union rules on political neutrality in the run up to the general election. According to Walsh's interview with ''[[Teesside Gazette]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1G1-408518499/director-upset-as-toryboy-film-screening-cancelled&lt;/ref&gt; the film was booked in by the Student Union, but at the last minute the screening was halted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2015/04/john-walsh-toryboy-the-move-banned-in-middlesbrough.html|title=ToryBoy The Movie – banned in Middlesbrough|author=John Walsh|work=Conservative Home|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Brown [http://mmj.tees.ac.uk/~project22/index5d95.html?p=863 Student Union involved in row over planned screening of controversial Toryboy the Movie], ''[[The North Crowd]]'' 27 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it's a shame really," said Walsh.

==Re-releases==
The film received a re-release in cinemas in 2015 in the lead up to the [[2015 UK General Election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishpost.co.uk/entertainment/documentary-that-exposed-labour-scandal-back-in-theatres-ahead-of-election|title=Satirical film ToryBoy The Movie returns to big screen|work=The Irish Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/11807584.BAFTA_nominated_Greenwich_filmmaker_s_controversial_ToryBoy_returns_to_cinemas_before_election/|title=BAFTA-nominated Greenwich filmmaker's controversial ToryBoy returns to cinemas before election|work=News Shopper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soundtrack ==
The film used older film ques from films across the last six decades to create a unique soundscape. ''[[Radio Times]]'' described it as "a fascinating odyssey illuminated by pithily informative animations and music from films like ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/c5xq27/toryboy-the-movie/|title=Toryboy the Movie – review - cast and crew, movie star rating and where to watch film on TV and online|website=Radio Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
