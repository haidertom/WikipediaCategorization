Starting in 1795, only colonels could be appointed to the position. It was supplemented by the rank of ''adjudant-commandant'' in 1800. In 1803 the position was abolished and adjudants-généraux reverted to the rank of colonel.

The next step was for a jury of 132 professional automotive journalists, from 33 different countries, under the presidency of [[Lord Montagu of Beaulieu]], to reduce the list to 5, which they did, and the result was announced in November 1999.  Finally the 5 were ranked by the jury and the overall winner was selected.

The '''Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia''' (CME) is a peak [[chamber of commerce|business]] and [[employers' association]] in [[Western Australia]] (WA).

[[File:Chamber of Mines Coolgardie.jpg|thumb|275px|The Coolgardie Chamber of Mines building, circa 1900, when the chamber merged with its counterpart in Kalgoorlie.]]

It originated with previous bodies that emerged during the 1890s in the [[Goldfields (Western Australia)|Goldfields]] region. The [[Coolgardie]] Chamber of Mines and Commerce, founded in 1895,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article216687416 |title=COOLGARDIE CHAMBER OF MINES. |newspaper=[[Coolgardie Miner]] |volume=3, |issue=681 |location=Western Australia |date=13 February 1897 |accessdate=5 February 2017 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; was followed in 1896 by a separate [[Kalgoorlie]] Chamber of Mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article32427937 |title=KALGOORLIE CHAMBER OF MINES. |newspaper=[[Kalgoorlie Western Argus]] |volume=III, |issue=140 |location=Western Australia |date=29 July 1897 |accessdate=5 February 2017 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] Chamber of Mines, founded in 1897,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article33149961 |title=PERTH CHAMBER OF MINES. |newspaper=[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|Western Mail]] |volume=XIII, |issue=632 |location=Western Australia |date=4 February 1898 |accessdate=5 February 2017 |page=49 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; quickly became defunct.&lt;ref name="cme"&gt;[https://www.cmewa.com/cme-and-our-members/about-us/cme-history CME, 2015, ''About Us CME History''] (5 February 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie bodies merged in 1900, as the Chamber of Mines of Western Australia.&lt;ref name="cme"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article88282583 |title=THE CHAMBER OF MINES OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA (INCORPORATED). |newspaper=[[Kalgoorlie Miner]] |volume=5, |issue=1604 |location=Western Australia |date=11 February 1901 |accessdate=5 February 2017 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters of the combined body were in the [[Western Australian School of Mines|Kalgoorlie Chamber of Mines building]]. It formed a security unit known as "The Bureau", to prevent and investigate gold theft and, from 1907, the chamber financed the [[Western Australian Police|WA Police]] [[Gold Stealing Detection Unit|Gold Squad]] (known later as the Gold Stealing Detection Unit), initially with an annual contribution of [[Australian pound|£]]2,000 per annum (more than [[Australian dollar|$]]275,000 in 2016).&lt;ref&gt;Kalgoorlie Miner, 4 Nov 1907, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rba"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rba.gov.au/calculator/annualPreDecimal.html|publisher=rba.gov.au|title=Inflation Calculator &amp;#124; RBA|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, other geological resources and regions became significant, such as [[iron ore]], [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] in the [[Pilbara]], along with [[nickel]], [[bauxite]] and [[mineral sands]] elsewhere, the organisation was renamed the Chamber of Minerals and Energy.&lt;ref name="cme"/&gt; It later moved to purpose-built headquarters in Perth.

==History==
Co-Creation Hub was founded in October 2010 by Bosun Tijani and Femi Longe. It officially opened in September 2011 as a social innovation centre at 294, Herbert Macaulay, [[Yaba, Lagos|Yaba]], serving as an open living lab dedicated to accelerating the application of social capital and technology for economic prosperity. Its methodology is said to be hinged on engaging a community of progressive stakeholders (end-users, subject matter experts, government agencies, businesses, academics, civil societies etc.) who bring their creativity and knowledge to play in co-creating solutions to social challenges faced by the average Nigerian.

At the CcHub, innovations by entrepreneurs are supported through advice, mentorship and funding through the pre-incubation and research unit. The CcHub happens to be one of the few financially sustainable innovation hubs in Africa and is the home to over 50 Nigerian [[Startup company|startup]]s, such as BudgIT, Wecyclers, Truppr, Genii Games, Lifebank, GoMyWay, Vacantboards, Traclist, Autobox, Stutern, Findworka, Grit Systems and Mamalette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/574892/nigerian-incubator-co-creation-hub-has-launched-a-5-million-investment-fund/|title=Nigerian incubator Co-Creation Hub has launched a $5 million investment fund|work=Quartz Africa|author=Yomi Kazeem|date=15 December 2015|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punchng.com/our-platform-focuses-on-expectant-mothers-lawal//|title=Our platform focuses on expectant mothers –Lawal|work=Punch Nigeria|author=Ife Adedapo|date=8 February 2016|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, [[Stanbic IBTC Holdings|Stanbic IBTC Bank]] launched the Blue Lab, an innovation hub supported by Co-Creation Hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techpoint.ng/2018/03/09/stanbic-ibtc-bank-launches-innovation-hub-yaba/|title=Stanbic IBTC Bank launches innovation hub in Yaba|website=techpoint.ng|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growth Capital by CcHub ==
In December 2015, Tijani announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bosuntijani.com/?p=286/|title=Growth Capital by CcHUB – a new beginning!|work=Bosun Tijani|author='Bosun Tijani|date=12 December 2015|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the launch of Growth Capital&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gc.fund/|title=GC by CCHub's Website|date=1 September 2016|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in partnership with Bank of Industry (BoI), Venture Garden Group (VGG) and [[Omidyar Network]] (ON). It is an investment arm that is set to invest 1billion Naira in social tech ventures who are building technologies that make public services smarter while connecting them to citizens and/or smart technologies linking multiple public services together to make them more accessible to citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://innovation-village.com/n1bn-cchub-growth-capital-officially-launched/|title=N1BN CCHUB GROWTH CAPITAL OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED|work=Innovation Nigeria|author='Paul Adepoju|date=19 January 2016|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GC's Managing Partner, Tunji Eleso, in an interview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techpoint.ng/2016/01/19/cchub-growth-capital-fund-interview/|title=Everything You Need to Know About the CcHub’s ₦1b Growth Capital Fund|author=Victor Ekwealor|date=19 January 2016|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Tech Crunch]], stated that after supporting startups from ideation, pre-incubation to incubation for five (5) years, it became imperative to take a step forward by supporting those are maturing but still require support. The fund proffered by Growth Capital by CcHUB is meant to support entrepreneurs who are building infrastructure for Nigeria’s future. "Specifically, we are looking at products/services/technology tools that would make public services smarter and at the same time connect more citizens of Nigeria to those services", Eleso added.

According to Bosun Tijani, "Growth Capital by CcHUB started as a dream back in 2010. I still remember the first time I shared the vision with Tunji Eleso and how we ended up crafting a smaller scheme to help build our pipeline and credibility while testing the social entrepreneurship model".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/574892/nigerian-incubator-co-creation-hub-has-launched-a-5-million-investment-fund/|title=Nigerian incubator Co-Creation Hub has launched a $5 million investment fund|work=Quartz Africa|author=Yomi Kazeem|date=15 December 2015|accessdate=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GC started receiving applications in January 2016 and is set to 'support next generation infrastructure technology builders in Nigeria' between 2016 and 2018.

'''Colnago Ernesto &amp; C. S.r.l.''' or '''Colnago''' is a manufacturer of high-end [[Road bicycle racing|road-racing]] [[Racing bicycle|bicycles]] founded by [[Ernesto Colnago]] near Milano in [[Cambiago]], [[Italy]]. Instead of following his family's farming business, Ernesto Colnago chose to work in the cycle trade, apprenticing first with Gloria Bicycles at 13, subsequently taking up road racing. After a bad crash ended his racing career, he began subcontracting for Gloria, opened his own shop in 1954, building his first frames the same year.&lt;ref&gt;See www.colnago.com\history.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rouleur.cc/editorial/the-wizard-of-cambiago/|title=The Wizard of Cambiago - Journal|date=2014-05-23|work=Journal|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; While building frames, he remained much in demand as a racing mechanic. He was second mechanic on the Nivea team [[Giro d'Italia]] under Faliero [[Masi Bicycles|Masi]] in 1955, eventually being employed as head mechanic for the [[Molteni]] team of Belgian cycling legend [[Eddy Merckx]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/features/?id=2004/colnago1 |title=www.cyclingnews.com - the world centre of cycling |publisher=Autobus.cyclingnews.com |date=2004-01-08 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company first became known for high quality steel framed bicycles suitable for the demanding environment of professional racing, and later as one of the more creative cycling manufacturers responsible for innovations in design and experimentation with new and diverse materials including carbon fiber, now a mainstay of modern bicycle construction.

== History ==
[[File:Ernesto Colnago signature.JPG|thumb|The signature of Ernesto Colnago, which appears as a decal on all new Colnago bicycles, except the special [[Ferrari]] versions.]]
In 1957, [[Gastone Nencini]] won the 1957 edition of the [[Giro d'Italia|Giro d’Italia]] bicycle race on a Colnago bicycle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

From the late 1960s through the 1970s, Colnago was generally regarded as one of the builders of the world's best custom road race frames. In 1960, Colnago rose to fame as [[Luigi Arienti]] rode to a gold medal at the [[1960 Summer Olympics|Rome Olympics]] on a Colnago bicycle.

While Ernesto was the head mechanic of the [[Molteni]] team, riders such as [[Gianni Motta]] raced on Colnago bikes. A win on a Colnago in the 1970 Milan-San Remo race by [[Michele Dancelli]] for the Molteni team inspired Colnago to change his logo to the now-famous 'Asso di Fiori' or Ace of Clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/sponsors/italia/2004/colnago/?id=colnago3 |title=www.cyclingnews.com news and analysis |publisher=Autobus.cyclingnews.com |date=2004-01-08 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the demise of the Faema team, Eddie Merckx joined the Molteni team, and what ensued was mutual innovation—as Colnago describes it: "Merckx was an up and coming champion, and I was an up and coming bike builder. So it was a real honour to work for a great champion like Merckx. It helped us to grow... when we made special forks, and special bikes." This included the super-light steel frame used by Merckx in 1972 to break the world one-hour record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/sponsors/italia/2004/colnago/?id=colnago5 |title=www.cyclingnews.com news and analysis |publisher=Autobus.cyclingnews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a growing reputation from their racing wins, Colnago plunged into the market for production bikes. In the U.S., the early seventies witnessed another [[bike boom]], and Colnago "pumped out bikes as though the future of humankind was at stake." The mainstay of the Colnago line in the 1970s was the Super, followed by the Mexico, named in honor of the successful hour attempt. Other models were added including the Superissimo and Esa Mexico. While the finish on these early Colnagos could be variable, they were great riding bikes and developed a cult-like following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheldonbrown.com/vrbn-a-f.html#colnago|title=Vintage Lightweight Pricing Guide Atala to Fuji|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Ernesto Colnago presented [[Pope]] [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] with a custom, gold-plated steel bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rouleur.cc/editorial/colnago-and-pope-john-paul-ii-the-man-with-the-golden-bike/|title=Colnago and Pope John Paul II: the Man with the Golden Bike - Journal|date=2016-10-28|work=Journal|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to criticism that his frames were not stiff enough, next Colnago experimented with ways to change the behavior of frame components. In 1983, he introduced the Oval CX with an oval-shaped top tube to add stiffness. He then experimented with various crimped-tube frames which became production models as their top of the range frames, beginning with the "Master." Later "Master-Light", Master Olympic and Master Piu extended the range. Colnago built a frame from [[Columbus tubing]] used by [[Giuseppe Saronni]] to win the world professional road race championship in 1982, and afterwards a short-lived collection of bikes were badged with the Saronni name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/sponsors/italia/2004/colnago/?id=colnago6 |title=www.cyclingnews.com news and analysis |publisher=Autobus.cyclingnews.com |date=2004-03-19 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Giuseppe Saronni would go on to win the Giro d'Italia stage race on a Colnago bicycle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since the 1980s, while Colnago continued to produce high-end steel bikes, they began to produce bike frames using material other than steel including titanium, aluminum, carbon and mixed material frames. One unique frame from this period, the Bititan, has a dual titanium down tube. Crimped and oversize tubes appeared on the Tecnos{{Ndash}}one of the lightest production steel bikes produced, and the same oversize tubes and crimping were used on the aluminum Dream frame. In 1981 Colnago prototyped the CX Pista{{Ndash}}a full monocoque carbon fiber bike with disc wheels that was shown at the Milan bike show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/sponsors/italia/colnago02/?id=bikes |title=www.cyclingnews.com news and analysis |publisher=Autobus.cyclingnews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Colnago worked with [[Ferrari]] in developing new [[Graphite-reinforced plastic|carbon fiber]] technology, and Ernesto also credits their engineers for challenging him regarding fork design, which led to Colnago's innovative Precisa straight-bladed steel fork (1987). Colnago also experimented with multi-material frames, including the CT-1 and CT-2 constructed with titanium main tubes, carbon fiber forks and rear stays, and a similarly constructed (although short-lived) Master frame constructed with steel main tubes, carbon forks and stays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebykr.com/2005/12/02/colnago-2/ |title=Ernesto Colnago: Fortune in Fracture and Ferrari |publisher=www.ebykr.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colnago's early attempts at carbon fiber frames were not commercially successful, but the lessons learned were embodied in their flagship frames, such as the C-40, the most sought after bicycle (1994), and its successor, the C-50 (2004){{Ndash}}respectively named for Colnago's 40th and 50th years in bike building. These carbon fiber frames set new standards of excellence. They were built using a modified form of traditional bike frame construction, substituting carbon fiber lugs for microinfusion cast steel, and carbon fiber "tubes" for the complex steel tubes used for steel frame construction. Similar building techniques are used in the latest offering, the C59, named (as before) for its year of production. While we take for granted the spread of carbon frames, their success was not a foregone conclusion:

“When we built the C40 we were the only ones to build carbon frames and all the mechanics and competitor technicians were saying that they would be too dangerous to use on cobbled roads, especially with the straight carbon forks. There was a company that wanted to fit suspension forks on the bicycle, but I wasn’t going to have suspension forks on the C40. The night before Paris- Roubaix I had Mr. Squinzi, the Mapei boss, on the phone to me raising his concerns about using such a delicate-looking thing. I told him that we’d done all of the tests that we could on the frame and the fork and we were certain there would be no problem. I had to take personal responsibility for what was going to happen and I spent all night worrying about it, barely able to sleep. But when I heard that there were 4 Mapei riders in the break, I knew I could relax.” &lt;ref name="pedalheadroadworks.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pedalheadroadworks.com/bicycles/colnago|title=Pedalhead Road Works - Colnago|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The C40 went on to win 5 editions of Paris-Roubaix in 6 years.&lt;ref name="pedalheadroadworks.com"/&gt;

An interview with Ernesto Colnago in which he describes various iconic Colnagos (filmed in the factory museum) is available on YouTube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ3zpFsmslo here].

==Trademark==
Colnago uses a black symbol similar to the ♣ ("Clubs") symbol used on playing cards. Colnago frames' graphics evolved from a font with gravitas to elaborate and/or creative paint.

==Colnago sponsored bicycle racing teams since 1968==
[[File:Colnago jersey.jpg|thumb|upright|Colnago jersey]]

Colnago has sponsored at least one professional team every year since 1974, often sponsoring more than one. In addition, other teams in the [[peloton]] have competed on Colnago bikes. Probably the most famous was the [[Molteni]] team which included [[Eddy Merckx]], but the world champion, [[Giuseppe Saronni]] also rode Colnago bikes throughout his career, from 1977 with Scic, later with Gis Gelati and with Colnago-Del Tongo. Colnago was well known as a sponsor of the legendary [[Mapei (cycling team)|Mapei cycling team]] throughout the 1990s. For 2005, Colnago sponsored the professional cycling team [[Rabobank (cycling)|Rabobank]]. Colnago has also been the bike sponsor for the American domestic team, [[Navigators]] for whom the Australian sprinter [[Hilton Clarke]] was a member 2005-2008.

For 2006, [[Team Milram]] joined their list of professionally sponsored teams featuring well-known [[Alessandro Petacchi]] and [[Erik Zabel]]. In addition, Colnago serves as a co-title sponsor of the Landbouwkrediet-Colnago professional cycling team that competes on the UCI Europe Tour and was the official frame supplier to Team Tinkoff in 2007.
Starting in the 2011 Tour de France, [[Team Europcar]] has ridden Colnago frames. For 2012, Colnago is sponsoring [[Colnago-CSF Bardiani]].

==Current production overview==
{{POV check|section|date=March 2009}}
Until early 2006, Colnago produced virtually all of their entire frameset range at their Cambiago factory, although persistent rumors of subcontracting out the more basic frames go all the way back to the 1970s. [[ALAN|Alan]] produced some aluminum frames for Colnago in the 1980s, including single and dual downtube road and cyclocross models. In March, 2005, Colnago announced that they were joining the Taiwanese-based A-Team, whose members include [[Giant Bicycles|Giant]], [[Merida Bikes|Merida]] and [[SRAM Corporation|SRAM]]—the first Italian manufacturer to do so, to produce mid-ranged bicycle models for the Japanese and European markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/colnago-s-entry-level-bikes-to-be-produced-in-taiwan/02071 |title=Colnago's entry level bikes to be produced in Taiwan &amp;#124; Bicycle Business |publisher=BikeBiz |date=2005-03-01 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2006, Colnago sourced the Primavera and the Arte from [[Giant Bicycles]] of [[Taiwan]]. Both received favorable reviews, although some thought the shift of manufacturing out of Italy was a matter of some regret.

There was some controversy in 2006 over whether Giant would be producing additional models, including carbon frame models, for Colnago. According to statements by Ernesto Colnago this was not the case:
: ''"For the 2006 model year, Colnago will be sourcing two entry-level aluminum road bike models from Giant, made to Colnago's spec and frame geometry and for sales in Europe and Asia only. All other Colnago bicycles are assembled in Italy. No Colnago carbon fiber frames are made at Giant and none will be, as Mr. Colnago has a long-term sourcing agreement in place with ATR for carbon fiber bicycle frames."&lt;ref&gt;John Crenshaw, "Colnago Rebutts Sourcing Reports," Bicycle Retailer and Industry News, August 15, 2005. Excepted here: http://business.highbeam.com/103/article-1G1-135579315/colnago-rebutts-sourcing-reports&lt;/ref&gt;''

Despite this denial, since 2007 Colnago's carbon monocoque CLX frame has been manufactured in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Italian appetizers from Colnago and Pinarello | date = 2007-08-08 | url = http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/italian-appetizers-from-colnago-and-pinarello | accessdate = 2010-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a second Colnago carbon fiber model, the CX-1 was also sourced in Taiwan.

The top of the line Colnago frame, the C64, as well as the Master, and the now discontinued C60, C59, C50, Extreme Power, Extreme C are (or were) manufactured and painted in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colnago.com/c59-italia/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729175818/http://www.colnago.com/c59-italia/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-29 |title=C59 Italia |publisher=Colnago |date= |accessdate=2012-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of public statements, Colnago has insisted that all designs originate with the Italian design team, claiming that the essence of what makes a Colnago is design. The mid-range carbon offerings are currently being sourced from Taiwan, (as are many bicycle manufacturers' offerings), and as of 2011, the M10 (which stands second in the model lineup) is made in Taiwan and assembled and painted in Italy, while the CX-1 is completely made in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bicycleretailer.com/news/newsDetail/6475.html|title=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current top of the line frame, the C64 is the only carbon frame still made fully in Italy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/4210/colnago-c64-review|title=Colnago C64 launch and first ride review|work=Cyclist|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Purpose Frames===
====Cyclocross====
Over the years, Ernesto Colnago built steel cyclocross frames for individual professional riders and did not sell any steel frames to the public. A handful have been identified, an early one based on the Colnago Super and built for Roger de Vlaeminck. Photos are available [https://www.flickr.com/photos/quality_vintage_bikes/sets/72157631648022202/with/8035017897/ here].  This frame sold in November 2012 on eBay for approximately $1200 US.

Three or four additional Super CX bikes have also been identified.

Another frame surfaced a couple of years ago, and appears to have been built in the mid to late 90s, loosely based on the Colnago Crystal, specifically labeled "Master" on the rear brake hanger. Lugs and seat stays are similar to those on the Crystal, slightly beefier tubing than other road models (32mm OD downtube, 29mm seattube), relaxed wheelbase, top tube routing for rear brake and derailleur, traditional routing for front derailleur but no braze-on for front derailleur. Colnago bottom bracket shell. Straight mtb style threadless fork (no formal crown). No serial number stamped on dropout. Colnago factory contact unable to identify year or provide further information. Photos are available [http://levitts.smugmug.com/photos/swfpopup.mg?AlbumID=19137949&amp;AlbumKey=q5WH7h here].

Colnago built a couple of bikes for the Italian cyclocross and MTB champion Luca Bramati. Bramati rode a yellow steel, lugless Colnago cyclocross bike in the '96 Worlds in Munich, considered to be one of the most exciting races ever, where he placed third. His bike had a front fork with a traditional brazed fork crown, and full front/rear gear cable brazings. The tubing looks just slightly oversized, and overall the bike looks quite similar to Bramati's Colnago MTB that he raced in Atlanta in the '96 Olympics.

Another may have been built for Bert Hiemstra in 1998/1999, Rabobank rider. This was a lugless steel frame, badged "Colnago Competition" in Rabobank colors, 59&amp;nbsp;cm CtT, set up with 9 speed Dura Ace and a unicrown fork.  [http://www.retrobike.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=198647 Sold] in the UK in 2012.

* Cyclocross (c 1980s) Manufactured by Alan, stamped "Colnago" name on bottom of headtube. Aluminum tubing screwed and glued to lugs. Sizing stamped in bottom bracket, no serial number on rear dropouts. Top tube ovalized for shouldering bike on transitions.
* Dream CX—Production aluminum like the Dream Road with unicrown MTB style front fork and additional bracing at headtube/downtube union.
* World Cup—
* Prestige—

====Mountain Bikes====
Although not very common or widely available in the American market, Colnago did produce a number of mountain bikes. Some featured the Master profile tubing found on the Colnago road bikes.
* Master—Gilco shaped tubing like the Master road bike, unicrown fork hard tail mountain bike
* Maxim--
* CF series CF12 Ferarri collaboration

The '''Country Land and Business Association''' ('''CLA''')  is a membership organisation for owners of land, property and businesses in rural England and Wales.

==Membership==
CLA members own or manage over 50% of the rural land in England and Wales. The 33,000-strong membership includes landowners, farmers and rural businesses.

==Function==
The CLA states that it "is the only organisation dedicated to defending your interests as a landowner and is your only truly independent and authoritative source of advice." It offers members a support and advice network through a free in-house policy, legal, and tax advisory service, as well as offering networking opportunities for landowners and rural businesses.

The CLA lobbies to protect its members' interests in relation to rural issues at local, national and EU levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cla.org.uk/latest/lobbying| title=Lobbying | publisher =CLA| accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The Policy team, based in the London office, offers advice on tax and legal, environment and conservation, agriculture and land management, as well as planning, housing and heritage. This includes issues such as the right to roam, reform of the EU Common Agricultural Policy, heritage, rural housing, renewable energy and taxation.

Six regional offices include teas of rural surveyors and advisors for local branch members.

The CLA publishes the monthly ''Land and Business'' magazine. This is available to all members as a part of their membership subscription.
   
==History==
The CLA was founded in 1907 after a [[pamphlet]] called "The Land and the Social Problem" was published by Algernon Tumor, a high-ranking [[civil service|civil servant]] and former private secretary to [[Benjamin Disraeli]], advocating the co-operation of owners, tenants and workers in the countryside for their common interests.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cla.org.uk/about-cla/history-cla | title=History of the CLA | publisher=CLA| accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation celebrated its centenary in 2007. Journalist Charles Clover wrote ''The History of the CLA'' to celebrate the anniversary.&lt;ref name= History/&gt;

==Structure==
The CLA is governed by a Council structure reflecting the breadth of the CLA's work. Council works to guide the organisation through shaping policy development and inspiring support within the membership.

There is a small board of directors that is responsible for the running of the CLA and for making sure that the organisation works as well as possible to deliver its core purposes.

There is a main corporate office based in London and also six regional offices:

* [[The Midlands|Midlands]] 
* [[East of England|East]] 
* [[South East England|South East]] 
* [[South West England|South West]] 
* [[Wales]] 
* [[North of England|North]]

==CLA Game Fair==

The CLA no longer runs the CLA Game Fair. It announced in September 2015 that it "could no longer ask CLA members to allow their membership subscriptions to underwrite the losses the event makes."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cla.org.uk/latest/news/statement-future-cla-game-fair&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creative destruction''' (German: ''schöpferische Zerstörung''), sometimes known as '''Schumpeter's gale''', is a concept in [[economics]] which since the 1950s has become most readily identified with the [[Austrians|Austrian]] economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]]&lt;ref name="reinert" /&gt; who derived it from the work of [[Karl Marx]] and popularized it as a theory of [[Innovation economics|economic innovation]] and the [[business cycle]].

According to Schumpeter, the "gale of creative destruction" describes the "process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one".&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1942_2"/&gt; In [[Marxian economic theory]] the concept refers more broadly to the linked processes of the accumulation and annihilation of [[wealth]] under capitalism.&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044757-1"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the earlier work of Marx, however, the idea of creative destruction or annihilation (German: ''Vernichtung'') implies not only that capitalism destroys and reconfigures previous economic orders, but also that it must ceaselessly devalue existing wealth (whether through war, dereliction, or regular and periodic economic crises) in order to clear the ground for the creation of new wealth.&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044757-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044575-7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marx1863"/&gt;

In ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'' (1942), Joseph Schumpeter developed the concept out of a careful reading of Marx’s thought (to which the whole of Part I of the book is devoted), arguing (in Part II) that the creative-destructive forces unleashed by capitalism would eventually lead to its demise as a system (see below).&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1942"&gt;{{cite book

==History==

=== In Marx's thought ===
Although the modern term "creative destruction" is not used explicitly by Marx, it is largely derived from his analyses, particularly in the work of Werner Sombart (whom Engels described as the only German professor who understood Marx's ''Capital''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Abram L. |last=Harris |title=Sombart and German (National) Socialism |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=50 |issue=6 |year=1942 |pages=805–35 [p. 807] |doi=10.1086/255964 |jstor=1826617 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and of Joseph Schumpeter, who discussed at length the origin of the idea in Marx's work (see below).

In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' of 1848, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] described the crisis tendencies of capitalism in terms of "the enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern bourgeois society, with its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells. [...] It is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the whole of bourgeois society on trial, each time more threateningly. In these crises, ''a great part not only of existing production, but also of previously created productive forces, are periodically destroyed''. In these crises, there breaks out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity – the epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation, had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why? Because there is too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions. […] And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand by ''enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces''; on the other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044757-1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A few years later, in the ''Grundrisse'', Marx was writing of "the violent destruction of capital not by relations external to it, but rather as a condition of its self-preservation".&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044575-7" /&gt; In other words, he establishes a necessary link between the generative or creative forces of production in capitalism and the destruction of capital value as one of the key ways in which capitalism attempts to overcome its internal contradictions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These contradictions lead to explosions, cataclysms, crises, in which [...] momentaneous suspension of labour and annihilation of a great portion of capital [...] violently lead it back to the point where it is enabled [to go on] fully employing its productive powers without committing suicide.&lt;ref name="isbn0-14-044575-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elliott1978-79"&gt;For further discussion of the concept of creative discussion in the Grundrisse, see {{Cite journal | last1 = Elliott | first1 = J. E. | title = Marx's "Grundrisse": Vision of Capitalism's Creative Destruction | jstor = 4537475 | journal = Journal of Post Keynesian Economics | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 148–69 | year = 1978 | doi = 10.2307/4537475| doi-broken-date = 2018-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the ''Theories of Surplus Value'' ("Volume IV" of ''[[Das Kapital]]'', 1863), Marx refines this theory to distinguish between scenarios where the destruction of (commodity) values affects either use values or exchange values or both together.&lt;ref name="isbn1-84467-095-3"/&gt; The destruction of exchange value combined with the preservation of use value presents clear opportunities for new capital investment and hence for the repetition of the production-devaluation cycle:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the destruction of capital through crises means the depreciation of values which prevents them from later renewing their reproduction process as capital on the same scale. This is the ruinous effect of the fall in the prices of commodities. It does not cause the destruction of any use-values. What one loses, the other gains. Values used as capital are prevented from acting again as capital in the hands of the same person. The old capitalists go bankrupt. [...] A large part of the nominal capital of the society, i.e., of the exchange-value of the existing capital, is once for all destroyed, although this very destruction, since it does not affect the use-value, may very much expedite the new reproduction. This is also the period during which moneyed interest enriches itself at the cost of industrial interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Social geographer [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] sums up the differences between Marx's usage of these concepts and Schumpeter's: "Both Karl Marx and Joseph Schumpeter wrote at length on the 'creative-destructive' tendencies inherent in capitalism. While Marx clearly admired capitalism's creativity he [...] strongly emphasised its self-destructiveness. The Schumpeterians have all along gloried in capitalism's endless creativity while treating the destructiveness as mostly a matter of the normal costs of doing business".&lt;ref name="isbn1-84668-308-4"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harvey, David|authorlink=David Harvey (geographer)|title=The Enigma of Capital and the Crises of Capitalism|publisher=Profile Books|location=London|year=2010|page=46|isbn=978-1-84668-308-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ww1dPgAACAAJ|accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other early usage ===
[[File:WLANL - MicheleLovesArt - Tropenmuseum - Shiva Nataraja (6274-1).jpg|thumb|In [[Hinduism]], the god [[Shiva]] is simultaneously destroyer and creator, portrayed as ''[[Shiva Nataraja]]'' (Lord of the Dance), which is proposed as the source of the Western notion of "creative destruction".&lt;ref name="reinert" /&gt;]]
In the [[Origin of Species]], which was published in 1859, [[Charles Darwin]] wrote that the "extinction of old forms is the almost inevitable consequence of the production of new forms."  One notable exception to this rule is how the extinction of the dinosaurs facilitated the [[adaptive radiation]] of mammals.  In this case creation was the consequence, rather than the cause, of destruction.    

In philosophical terms, the concept of "creative destruction" is close to [[Hegel]]´s concept of [[Aufheben|sublation]]. In German economic discourse it was taken up from Marx's writings by [[Werner Sombart]], particularly in his 1913 text ''Krieg und Kapitalismus'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sombart |first=W. |authorlink=Werner Sombart |year=1913 |title=Krieg und Kapitalismus |trans-title=War and Capitalism |location=Leipzig |publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot |page=207 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeLrAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Again, however, ''from destruction a new spirit of creation arises;'' the scarcity of wood and the needs of everyday life... forced the discovery or invention of substitutes for wood, forced the use of coal for heating, forced the invention of coke for the production of iron.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hugo Reinert has argued that Sombart's formulation of the concept was influenced by [[Eastern mysticism]], specifically the image of the [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]], who is presented in the paradoxical aspect of simultaneous destroyer and creator.&lt;ref name="reinert" /&gt; Conceivably this influence passed from [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], who brought Hindu thought to German philosophy in his ''Philosophy of Human History'' (Ideen zur Philosophie der Geschichte der Menschheit) (Herder 1790–92), specifically volume III, pp.&amp;nbsp;41–64.&lt;ref name="reinert" /&gt; via [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and the [[oriental studies|Orientalist]] [[Friedrich Maier]] through [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]´s writings. Nietzsche represented the creative destruction of modernity through the mythical figure of [[Dionysus]], a figure whom he saw as at one and the same time "destructively creative" and "creatively destructive".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following passage from ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'' (1887), Nietzsche argues for a universal principle of a cycle of creation and destruction, such that every creative act has its destructive consequence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But have you ever asked yourselves sufficiently how much the erection of every ideal on earth has cost? How much reality has had to be misunderstood and slandered, how many lies have had to be sanctified, how many consciences disturbed, how much "God" sacrificed every time? If a temple is to be erected a temple must be destroyed: that is the law – let anyone who can show me a case in which it is not fulfilled! – [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other nineteenth-century formulations of this idea include Russian [[anarchist]] [[Mikhail Bakunin]], who wrote in 1842, "The passion for destruction is a creative passion, too!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1842/reaction-germany.htm The Reaction in Germany, From the Notebooks of a Frenchman], October 1842&lt;/ref&gt; Note, however, that this earlier formulation might more accurately be termed "destructive creation",{{Original research inline|date=July 2014}} and differs sharply from Marx's and Schumpeter's formulations in its focus on the active destruction of the existing social and political order by human agents (as opposed to systemic forces or contradictions in the case of both Marx and Schumpeter).

=={{Anchor|Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter}}Association with Joseph Schumpeter==
The expression "creative destruction" was popularized by and is most associated with Joseph Schumpeter, particularly in his book ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'', first published in 1942. Already in his 1939 book ''Business Cycles'', he attempted to refine the innovative ideas of [[Nikolai Kondratieff]] and his [[Kondratiev wave|long-wave]] cycle which Schumpeter believed was driven by technological innovation.&lt;ref name="Crumbling Walls"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, in ''Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy'', Schumpeter introduced the term "creative destruction", which he explicitly derived from Marxist thought (analysed extensively in Part I of the book) and used it to describe the disruptive process of transformation that accompanies such innovation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Capitalism [...] is by nature a form or method of economic change and not only never is but never can be stationary. [...] The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.&lt;p&gt;[...] The opening up of new markets, foreign or domestic, and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as U.S. Steel illustrate the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure ''from within'', incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism. It is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in.&lt;p&gt;[... Capitalism requires] the perennial gale of Creative Destruction.&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1942_2"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Schumpeter's vision of capitalism, innovative entry by [[entrepreneurs]] was the disruptive force that sustained [[economic growth]], even as it destroyed the value of established companies and laborers that enjoyed some degree of [[monopoly]] power derived from previous technological, organizational, regulatory, and economic paradigms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. Gregory |last=Sidak |first2=David J. |last2=Teece |title=Dynamic Competition in Antitrust Law |journal=[[Journal of Competition Law &amp; Economics]] |year=2009 |volume=5  |issue=4 |pages=581–631 [p. 604] |doi=10.1093/joclec/nhp024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Schumpeter was pessimistic about the sustainability of this process, seeing it as leading eventually to the undermining of capitalism's own institutional frameworks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In breaking down the pre-capitalist framework of society, capitalism thus broke not only barriers that impeded its progress but also flying buttresses that prevented its collapse. That process, impressive in its relentless necessity, was not merely a matter of removing institutional deadwood, but of removing partners of the capitalist stratum, symbiosis with whom was an essential element of the capitalist schema. [... T]he capitalist process in much the same way in which it destroyed the institutional framework of feudal society also undermines its own.&lt;ref name="Schumpeter1942" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Schumpeter nevertheless elaborated the concept, making it central to his economic theory, and it was later taken up as a major doctrine of the so-called Austrian School of free-market economic thought.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

He wrote, "The Illinois Central not only meant very good business whilst it was built and whilst new cities were built around it and land was cultivated, but it spelled the death sentence for the [old] agriculture of the [[Western United States|West]]."&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, J.

In fact, successful [[innovation]] is normally a source of temporary [[market power]], eroding the profits and position of old firms, yet ultimately succumbing to the pressure of new inventions commercialised by competing entrants.

{{Quote|These economic facts have certain social consequences. As the critics of the market economy nowadays prefer to take their stand on "social" grounds, it may be not inappropriate here to elucidate the true social results of the market process. We have already spoken of it as a leveling process. More aptly, we may now describe these results as an instance of what [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] called "[[circulation of elite|the circulation of elites]]." Wealth is unlikely to stay for long in the same hands. It passes from hand to hand as unforeseen change confers value, now on this, now on that specific resource, engendering capital gains and losses.

He developed the notion that capitalism finds a "[[spatial fix]]"&lt;ref&gt;See in particular "The Spatial Fix: Hegel, Von Thünen and Marx", in {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDRzPCb4Zd4C |isbn=978-0-415-93241-7 |title=Spaces of Capital: Towards a Critical Geography |last=Harvey |first=David |authorlink=David Harvey (geographer) |year=2001 |pages=284–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its periodic crises of overaccumulation through investment in fixed assets of infrastructure, buildings, etc.: "The built environment that constitutes a vast field of collective means of production and consumption absorbs huge amounts of capital in both its construction and its maintenance. Urbanization is one way to absorb the capital surplus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the creation of the built environment can act as a form of crisis displacement, it can also constitute a limit in its own right, as it tends to freeze productive forces into a fixed spatial form. As capital cannot abide a limit to profitability, ever more frantic forms of "[[time-space compression]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RAGeva8_ElMC |isbn=978-0-631-16294-0 |pages=240–323 |title=The Condition of Postmodernity: an Enquiry into the Origins of Cultural Change |last=Harvey |first=David |authorlink=David Harvey (geographer) |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; (increased speed of turnover, innovation of ever faster transport and communications' infrastructure, "flexible accumulation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-631-16294-0 |page=147 |title=The Condition of Postmodernity |last=Harvey |first=David |authorlink=David Harvey (geographer) |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;) ensue, often impelling technological innovation. Such innovation, however, is a double-edged sword:

{{Quote|The effect of continuous innovation [...] is to devalue, if not destroy, past investments and labour skills. ''Creative destruction'' is embedded within the circulation of capital itself. Innovation exacerbates instability, insecurity, and in the end, becomes the prime force pushing capitalism into periodic paroxysms of crisis. [...] The struggle to maintain profitability sends capitalists racing off to explore all kinds of other possibilities. New product lines are opened up, and that means the creation of new wants and needs. Capitalists are forced to redouble their efforts to create new needs in others [...]. The result is to exacerbate insecurity and instability, as masses of capital and workers shift from one line of production to another, leaving whole sectors devastated [...]. The drive to relocate to more advantageous places (the geographical movement of both capital and labour) periodically revolutionizes the international and territorial division of labour, adding a vital geographical dimension to the insecurity. The resultant transformation in the experience of space and place is matched by revolutions in the time dimension, as capitalists strive to reduce the turnover time of their capital to "the twinkling of an eye".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-631-16294-0 |pages=105–06 |title=The Condition of Postmodernity |last=Harvey |first=David |authorlink=David Harvey (geographer) |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Globalization can be viewed as some ultimate form of time-space compression, allowing capital investment to move almost instantaneously from one corner of the globe to another, devaluing fixed assets and laying off labour in one urban conglommeration while opening up new centres of manufacture in more profitable sites for production operations. Hence, in this continual process of creative destruction, capitalism does not resolve its contradictions and crises, but merely "moves them around geographically".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video

=== Marshall Berman ===
In his 1987 book ''All That is Solid Melts into Air: The Experience of Modernity'',&lt;ref name="isbn0-86091-785-1" /&gt; particularly in the chapter entitled "Innovative Self-Destruction" (pp.&amp;nbsp;98–104), [[Marshall Berman]] provides a reading of Marxist "creative destruction" to explain key processes at work within modernity. The title of the book is taken from a well-known passage from ''The Communist Manifesto''. Berman elaborates this into something of a ''[[Zeitgeist]]'' which has profound social and cultural consequences:

{{Quote|The truth of the matter, as Marx sees, is that everything that bourgeois society builds is built to be torn down. "All that is solid"—from the clothes on our backs to the looms and mills that weave them, to the men and women who work the machines, to the houses and neighborhoods the workers live in, to the firms and corporations that exploit the workers, to the towns and cities and whole regions and even nations that embrace them all—all these are made to be broken tomorrow, smashed or shredded or pulverized or dissolved, so they can be recycled or replaced next week, and the whole process can go on again and again, hopefully forever, in ever more profitable forms. The pathos of all bourgeois monuments is that their material strength and solidity actually count for nothing and carry no weight at all, that they are blown away like frail reeds by the very forces of capitalist development that they celebrate. Even the most beautiful and impressive bourgeois buildings and public works are disposable, capitalized for fast depreciation and planned to be obsolete, closer in their social functions to tents and encampments than to "Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, Gothic cathedrals".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Berman |first=Marshall |title=All That is Solid Melts into Air |year=1987 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here Berman emphasizes Marx's perception of the fragility and evanescence of capitalism's immense creative forces, and makes this apparent contradiction into one of the key explanatory figures of modernity.

=== Manuel Castells ===
The sociologist [[Manuel Castells]], in his trilogy on ''[[The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture]]'' (the first volume of which, ''[[The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture#The Rise of the Network Society|The Rise of the Network Society]]'', appeared in 1996),&lt;ref name="isbn0-631-22140-9" /&gt; reinterpreted the processes by which capitalism invests in certain regions of the globe, while divesting from others, using the new paradigm of "informational networks". In the era of globalization, capitalism is characterized by near-instantaneous flow, creating a new spatial dimension, "the [[space of flows]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Castells |first=Manuel |title=The Rise of the Network Society |pages=376–428}}&lt;/ref&gt; While technological innovation has enabled this unprecedented fluidity, this very process makes redundant whole areas and populations who are bypassed by informational networks. Indeed, the new spatial form of the [[megacity|mega-city]] or megalopolis, is defined by Castells as having the contradictory quality of being "globally connected and locally disconnected, physically and socially".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Castells |first=Manuel |title=The Rise of the Network Society |page=404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castells explicitly links these arguments to the notion of creative destruction:

{{Quote|The "spirit of informationalism" is the culture of "creative destruction" accelerated to the speed of the optoelectronic circuits that process its signals. Schumpeter meets [[Max Weber|Weber]] in the cyberspace of the network enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Castells |first=Manuel |title=The Rise of the Network Society |page=199}} For further discussion, see also {{Cite journal

===Daniele Archibugi===
Developing the Schumpeterian legacy, the school of the [[Science Policy Research Unit]] of the [[University of Sussex]] has further detailed the importance of creative destruction exploring, in particular, how new technologies are often idiosyncratic with the existing productive regimes and will lead to bankruptcy companies and even industries that do not manage to sustain the rate of change. [[Christopher Freeman|Chris Freeman]] and [[Carlota Perez]] have developed these insights.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Freeman|Chris Freeman]] and Francisco Louça, ''As Time Goes By: From the Industrial Revolutions to the Information Revolution'' (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2001). [[Carlota Perez]], ''Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital. The Dynamics of Bubbles and Golden Ages'', (Cheltenham  Glos, Edward Elgar, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Daniele Archibugi]] and Andrea Filippetti have associated the 2008 economic crisis to the slow-down of opportunities offered by information and communication technologies (ICTs).&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Archibugi and Andrea Filippetti, [https://www.routledge.com/Innovation-and-Economic-Crisis-Lessons-and-Prospects-from-the-Economic/Archibugi-Filippetti/p/book/9780415602280 ''Innovation and Economic Crisis Lessons and Prospects from the Economic Downturn''], (London, Routledge, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Using as a metaphor the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', Archibugi has argued that of the innovations described in the film in 1982, all those associated to ICTs have become part of our everyday life. But, on the contrary, none of those in the field of Biotech have been fully commercialized. A new economic recovery will occur when some key technological opportunities will be identified and sustained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniele Archibugi]], [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2557335 Blade Runner Economics: Will Innovation Lead the Economic Recovery?], SSRN Papers 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Technological opportunities do not enter into economic and social life without deliberate efforts and choices. We should be able to envisage new forms of organization associated with emerging technology. ICTs have already changed our lifestyle even more than our economic life: they have generated jobs and profits, but above all they have transformed the way we use our time and interact with the world. Biotech could bring about even more radical social transformations at the core of our life. Why have these not yet been delivered? What can be done to unleash their potential? There are a few basic questions that need to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Daniele Archibugi, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2557335 Blade Runner Economics.

=== Others ===
In 1992, the idea of creative destruction was put into formal mathematical terms by [[Philippe Aghion]] and [[Peter Howitt (economist)|Peter Howitt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aghion |first=Philippe |last2=Howitt |first2= Peter |title=A Model of Growth Through Creative Destruction |journal=Econometrica |year=1992 |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=323–51 |jstor=2951599 |doi=10.2307/2951599 |hdl=1721.1/63839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving an alternative model of [[Endogenous growth theory|endogenous growth]] compared to [[Paul Romer]]'s expanding varieties model.

In 1995, [[Harvard Business School]] authors [[Richard L. Nolan]] and David C. Croson released ''Creative Destruction:  A Six-Stage Process for Transforming the Organization.''  The book advocated downsizing to free up slack resources, which could then be reinvested to create [[competitive advantage]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

More recently, the idea of "creative destruction" was utilized by Max Page in his 1999 book, ''The Creative Destruction of Manhattan, 1900–1940.''  The book traces [[Manhattan]]'s constant reinvention, often at the expense of preserving a concrete past. Describing this process as "creative destruction," Page describes the complex historical circumstances, economics, social conditions and personalities that have produced crucial changes in Manhattan's cityscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Page|first=Max|title=The Creative Destruction of Manhattan, 1900–1940|year=1999|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-64468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Max Page, others have used the term “creative destruction” to describe the process of urban renewal and modernization. T.C. Chang and Shirlena Huang referenced “creative destruction” in their paper ''Recreating place, replacing memory: Creative Destruction at the [[Singapore River]].'' The authors explored the efforts to redevelop a waterfront area that reflected a vibrant new culture while paying sufficient homage to the history of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=T.C.|author2=Shirlena Huang|title=Recreating place, replacing memory: Creative destruction at the Singapore River|journal=Asia Pacific Viewpoint|date=December 2005|volume=46|issue=3|pages=267–80|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8373.2005.00285.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rosemary Wakeman chronicled the evolution of an area in central Paris, France known as [[Les Halles]]. Les Halles housed a vibrant marketplace starting in the twelfth century. Ultimately, in 1971, the markets were relocated and the pavilions torn down. In their place, now stand a hub for trains, subways and buses. Les Halles is also the site of the largest shopping mall in France and the controversial Centre Georges Pompidou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wakeman|first=Rosemary|title=Fascinating Les Halles|journal=French Politics, Culture &amp; Society|date=Summer 2007|volume=25|issue=2|pages=46–72|doi=10.3167/fpcs.2007.250205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “creative destruction” has been applied to the arts. Alan Ackerman and Martin Puncher (2006) edited a collection of essays under the title ''Against Theater: Creative destruction on the modernist stage.'' They detail the changes and the causal motivations experienced in [[theater]] as a result of the modernization of both the production of performances and the underlying economics. They speak of how theater has reinvented itself in the face of [[anti-theatricality]], straining the boundaries of the traditional to include more physical productions, which might be considered avant-garde staging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ackerman|first=Alan|title=Against Theater|year=2006|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4039-4491-7|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1999 book, ''Still the New World, American Literature in a Culture of Creative Destruction'', [[Philip Fisher (author)|Philip Fisher]] analyzes the themes of creative destruction at play in literary works of the twentieth century, including the works of such authors as [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Mark Twain]], and [[Henry James]], among others. Fisher argues that creative destruction exists within literary forms just as it does within the changing of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Still the New World: American Literature in a Culture of Creative Destruction|last=Fisher|first=Philip|publisher=Harvard University Press, Second Edition|year=1999|isbn=978-0674004092|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neoconservative]] author [[Michael Ledeen]] argued in his 2002 book ''The War Against the Terror Masters'' that America is a revolutionary nation, undoing traditional societies: "Creative destruction is our middle name, both within our own society and abroad. We tear down the old order every day, from business to science, literature, art, architecture, and cinema to politics and the law." His characterization of creative destruction as a model for social development has met with fierce opposition from [[paleoconservative]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=John Laughland |first=John |last=Laughland |url=http://www.amconmag.com/article/2003/jun/30/00013/ |title=Flirting with Fascism. Neocon theorist Michael Ledeen draws more from Italian fascism than from the American Right |journal=American Conservative |date=June 30, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative destruction has also been linked to sustainable development. The connection was explicitly mentioned for the first time by Stuart L. Hart and Mark B. Milstein in their 1999 article ''Global Sustainability and the Creative Destruction of Industries'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stuart |last=Hart |first2=Mark |last2=Milstein |title=Global Sustainability and the Creative Destruction of Industries |journal=Sloan Management Review |volume=41 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=23–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he argues new profit opportunities lie in a round of creative destruction driven by global sustainability. (An argument which they would later on strengthen in their 2003 article ''Creating Sustainable Value''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stuart L. |last=Hart |first2=Mark B. |last2=Milstein |title=Creating Sustainable Value |journal=Academy of Management Executive |volume=17 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=56–67 |doi=10.5465/AME.2003.10025194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2005, with ''Innovation, Creative Destruction and Sustainability''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stuart L. |last=Hart |title=Innovation, Creative Destruction and Sustainability |journal=Research Technology Management |volume=48 |issue=5 |year=2005 |pages=21–27 |doi=10.1080/08956308.2005.11657334}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Andrea L. Larson agreed with this vision a year later in ''Sustainable Innovation Through an Entrepreneurship Lens'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrea L. |last=Larson |title=Sustainable Innovation Through an Entrepreneurship Lens |journal=Business Strategy and the Environment |volume=9 |year=2000 |pages=304–17 |doi=10.1002/1099-0836(200009/10)9:5&lt;304::AID-BSE255&gt;3.0.CO;2-O |issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stating entrepreneurs should be open to the opportunities for disruptive improvement based on sustainability. In 2005, James Hartshorn (et al.) emphasized the opportunities for sustainable, disruptive improvement in the construction industry in his article ''Creative Destruction: Building Toward Sustainability''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=James |last=Hartshorn |first2=Michael |last2=Maher |first3=Jack |last3=Crooks |first4=Richard |last4=Stahl |first5=Zoë |last5=Bond |title=Creative Destruction: Building Toward Sustainability |journal=Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering |volume=32 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=170–80 |doi=10.1139/l04-119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative name==
The following text appears to be the source of the phrase "Schumpeter's Gale" to refer to creative destruction:

{{quote|The opening up of new markets and the organizational development from the craft shop and factory to such concerns as US Steel illustrate the process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one ... [The process] must be seen in its role in the perennial gale of creative destruction; it cannot be understood on the hypothesis that there is a perennial lull.|Joseph Schumpeter|''Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy'', 1942}}

==In popular culture==
The film ''[[Other People's Money]]'' (1991) provides contrasting views of creative destruction, presented in two speeches regarding the takeover of a publicly traded wire and cable company in a small New England town. One speech is by a [[corporate raider]], and the other is given by the company CEO, who is principally interested in protecting his employees and the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenneth M.

      <comment>Changed "dyes" to "dies". Dye is used to color something, die is tooling the fluid exits as it becomes a curtain.</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4665">'''Curtain coating''' is a process that creates an uninterrupted curtain of fluid that falls onto a substrate.  The substrate is transported on a [[conveyor belt]] or [[calender]] rolls at a regulated speed through the curtain to ensure an even coat of the [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]. The curtain is created by using a slit or die at the base of the holding tank, allowing the liquid to fall upon the substrate. Some polymers are melted and [[extruded]] for coating.   Many manufactures will also include a catch pan to retrieve and reuse the excess fluid.

==Process==
Curtain coating is a process in which the object or substrate to be coated is guided through a curtain of fluid located in a gap between two conveyors. The mechanism is formed by a tank of fluid from which a thin screen falls down in between the two conveyors. The thickness of the coating layer that falls upon the object is mainly determined by the speed of the conveyor and the amount of material leaving the tank (pump speed). Curtain coating is a premetered method, which means that the amount of liquid required is supplying from the tank to the screen, to be deposited on the substrate. 

Curtain coating is one of the technologies used in the converting industry to modify the properties of substrates.

==Edging==
To be certain the flow of the liquid is disrupted, an edging along both sides of the slit is required.  This is to prohibit the [[surface tension]] from causing the coating to taper in; sometimes edging alone is not enough and a [[surfactant]] must be added to lower the surface tension.

==Flow rate==
It is also important to note that each fluid  has its own minimum flow rate.  The minimum flow rate is the smallest amount of dye at a given moment to keep the curtain flowing continuously.  The minimum flow rate is directly proportional to the surface tension while [[viscosity]] is inversely proportional.

Curtain coating is a pre-metered coating method, which means that the exact amount of coating needed to coat the substrate can be calculated before the process is actually accomplished.  This is can be done by using the ratio of the flow rate (with respect to volume) and width of the substrate to the speed at which the substrate passes under the "curtain" of coating fluid.  

Because of the ability to calculate the exact (or nearly so) amount of fluid needed for a given project, film thickness variations on the finished product can be kept within +/− 0.5% of the target thickness

==Benefits of curtain coating==
* Faster coating velocity
* Ability to produce a thinner coat
* Easily coat abstract surfaces
* Lower cost of dies
* Lower waste of coating
* Coats a more uniform layer

==Deficits of curtain coating==
* Minimum flow rate
* Air entrainment
* Rough surfaces are more likely to have air entrainment
* Management of airflow around the apparatus

==Geometrical possibilities==
* Curtain coating is usually only effective on relatively flat substrates.  Because of the possibility of air pockets being formed beneath the coating, it is not advisable to use curtain coating on substrates with extremely rough or angular surfaces with grooves and pits etc.

==Production rates==
* Production rates are only limited by the maximum speed that the fluid can be laid down on the substrate without breaking the curtain or getting air bubbles between the substrate and the coating material.  This is dependent mainly upon the viscosity of the coating fluid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4512">'''Daniel Bonventre''' (born c. 1944) is one of five former [[Bernard Madoff|Madoff]] employees charged in the [[Madoff investment scandal]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/prosecutors-play-hardball-with-a-madoff-defendant/ Prosecutors Pressure Daniel Bonventre, a Madoff Defendant - NYTimes.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/26/business/26madoff.html Daniel Bonventre, Ex-Madoff Aide, Charged in Fraud - NYTimes.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He had worked as one-time company director of operations and as an accountant for Madoff since the 1960s. He was arrested on February 25, 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/02/daniel_bonventre_former_bernar.html Daniel Bonventre, former Bernard Madoff executive, is arrested | syracuse.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and charged with allegedly having created false and [[fraud]]ulent books and records, conspiracy, [[securities fraud]], and tax-related charges. He is also being sued by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] for falsifying records.

Prosecutors claim that Bonventre used $154 million of clients' funds to help obtain a $145 million loan. He has also been charged with concealing over $270,000 in income tax between 2003 and 2007.

Another criminal complaint alleges that he helped to arrange millions in illegal payments and loans to Madoff family members and unidentified employees, some of which were used to purchase luxury homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/25/daniel-bonventre-arrested_n_476322.html Daniel Bonventre ARRESTED: Former Madoff Operations Executive To Face Criminal Charges&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, almost three years before other investors lost their life savings, Bonventre emptied his personal accounts at the firm.

On March 24, 2014, he was convicted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/jury-finds-madoff-guilty-counts-article-1.1732198&lt;/ref&gt; He may be sentenced to a maximum of 77 years in prison if convicted. 

On February 25, 2010, he was freed on a $5 million bond.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.nydailynews.com/2010-02-25/news/27057487_1_madoff-securities-bernie-madoff-madoff-employee Ponzi plot thickens: Ex-operations director of Madoff Securities, Daniel Bonventre, arrested - New York Daily News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 2010, prosecutors sent a letter to Bonventre's defense lawyer, Andrew J. Frisch, demanding that none of the $820,000 given to him to defend the case be used. The reason for this is because the funds would be subject to forfeiture if Bonventre is convicted of criminal charges.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In January 2011, Bonventre filed a suit demanding that the indictment against him be dismissed because the prosecutor had made efforts to seize his defense funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-01-04/news/27086264_1_bernie-madoff-assets-ponzi Madoff aides Annette Bongiorno and Daniel Bonventre sue government for seizing assets - New York Daily News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/04/bernard-madoff-aides-bonventre-bongiorno Bernard Madoff aides demand to be released from jail | Business | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-03/ex-madoff-aide-bonventre-seeks-dismissal-of-charges-cites-asset-seizure.html Ex-Madoff Aide Bonventre Seeks Dismissal of Charges, Cites Asset Seizure - Bloomberg&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Aaker Model===

Aaker is the creator of the Aaker Model, a marketing model that views [[brand equity]] as a combination of [[brand awareness]], [[brand loyalty]], and [[brand]] associations.&lt;ref name=schawbelinterview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.personalbrandingblog.com/personal-branding-interview-david-aaker/ |title=Personal Branding Interview: David Aaker |author=Schawbel, Dan |publisher=PersonalBrandingBlog.com |date=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model outlines the necessity of developing a [[brand identity]], which is a unique set of brand associations representing what the brand stands for and offers to customers an aspiring [[brand image]].&lt;ref name=bsb&gt;{{cite book |last=Aaker |first=David |title=Building Strong Brands |year=1996 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=002900151X |page=400 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaker primarily sees brand identity as consisting of 8–12 elements which fall under four perspectives:
* Brand as Product – consists of [[product (business)|product]] scope, product attributes, quality or value of the product, uses, users and country of origin.
* Brand as Organisation – consists of organizational attributes and local workings versus global activities.
* Brand as Person – consists of brand personality and customer-brand relationships.
* Brand as Symbol – consists of audio and visual imagery, metaphorical [[symbols]] and brand heritage.&lt;ref name=bsb /&gt;

Aaker first introduced the model in his book ''Building Strong Brands'' (1996).

==Publications==
Aaker is the author of more than 100 articles and 14 books on [[marketing]] and [[brand management|branding]].&lt;ref name=advertisingshow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theadvertisingshow.com/en/art/1735/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710071515/http://www.theadvertisingshow.com/en/art/1735/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |title=Author David Aaker Explains How Companies Should Beat Competitors by Making Them Irrelevant |author1=Forsythe, Brad |author2=Schilens, Ray |publisher=The Advertising Show |date=June 15, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=simonschusterprofile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://authors.simonandschuster.com/David-A-Aaker/1451364/books |title=Simon &amp; Schuster Profile |publisher=SimonandSchuster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Decree of the President of the Russian Federation''' ({{lang-ru|Указ Президента Российской Федерации}}; ''Ukaz Prezidenta Rossiyskoy Federatsii'') or '''Executive Order (Decree) of the President of Russia'''&lt;ref&gt;The English term "Executive Order" is also used by official website as equivalent of Russian ''ukaz''.

As normative legal acts, such ''ukazes'' have the status of [[by-law]]s in the hierarchy of legal acts (along with [[Order of the Government of Russia|Decrees of the Government of the Russian Federation]] and instructions and directions of other officials). Presidential decrees may not alter existing laws of higher precedence  - [[:Category:Treaties of Russia|Russia's international agreements]], the [[Constitution of Russia]], [[Federal Constitutional Law (Russia)|Federal Constitutional Law]]s, [[Federal Law]]s and [[laws of Russian regions]] - and may be superseded by any of these laws. For example, because of Article 15 of the Constitution of Russia, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], as an international document, has higher status than any Russian law or presidential executive order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.constitution.kremlin.ru/#article-15-4 "Universally recognized principles and norms of international law as well as international agreements of the Russian Federation should be an integral part of its legal system. If an international agreement of the Russian Federation establishes rules, which differ from those stipulated by law, ''then the rules of the international agreement shall be applied''."]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC''' ('''DCI''') is a joint venture of major motion picture studios, formed to establish a standard [[systems architecture|architecture]] for [[digital cinema]] systems.

The organization was formed in March 2002 by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]],{{Efn | [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] withdrew as a member of DCI in May 2005, prior to the release of the DCI Specification.}} [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Universal Studios]], [[The Walt Disney Company]] and [[Warner Bros.]]

The primary purpose of DCI is to establish and document specifications for an [[open architecture]] for digital cinema that ensures a uniform and high level of technical performance, reliability and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = DCI | type = home page | url = http://www.dcimovies.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By establishing a common set of content requirements, [[film distributor|distributors]], [[production company|studios]], [[movie theater|exhibitors]], d-cinema manufacturers and vendors can be assured of interoperability and compatibility. Because of the relationship of DCI to many of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]'s key studios, conformance to DCI's specifications is considered a requirement by [[software developers]] or equipment manufacturers targeting the digital cinema market.

==Specification==
On July 20, 2005, DCI released Version 1.0 of its "Digital Cinema System Specification", commonly referred to as the "DCI Specification". The document describes overall system requirements and specifications for digital cinema. Between March 28, 2006, and March 21, 2007, DCI issued 148 errata to Version 1.0.

DCI released Version 1.1 of the DCI Specification on April 12, 2007, incorporating the previous 148 errata into the DCI Specification. On April 15, 2007, at the annual NAB Digital Cinema Summit, DCI announced the new version, as well as some future plans. They released a "Stereoscopic Digital Cinema Addendum"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Stereoscopic DC | type = addendum | publisher = DCI | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url = http://www.dcimovies.com/DCI_Stereoscopic_DC_Addendum.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to begin to establish 3-D technical specifications in response to the popularity of [[3-D film|3-D stereoscopic films]]. It was also announced "which studios would take over the leadership roles in DCI after the current leadership term expires at the end of September."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2007/digital/markets-festivals/dci-announces-digital-3-d-specs-1117963138/|title=DCI announces digital, 3-D specs|last=Cohen|first=David S|date=2007-04-15|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-10|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, between August 27, 2007, and February 1, 2008, DCI issued 100 errata to Version 1.1. So, DCI released Version 1.2 of the DCI Specification on March 7, 2008, again incorporating the previous 100 errata into the specification document. An additional 96 errata were issued by August 30, 2012, so a revised Version 1.2 incorporating those additional errata was approved on October 10, 2012. DCI approved DCI Specification Version 1.3 on June 27, 2018, integrating the 45 errata issued to the previous version into a new document. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = DCSS Version 1.3 | date = 2018-06-27 | publisher = DCI | url = http://dcimovies.com/specification/DCI_DCSS_Ver1-3_2018-0627.pdf | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The previous versions are also archived on the DCI web site.

Based on many [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|SMPTE]] and [[International Standards Organization|ISO]] standards, such as [[JPEG 2000]]-compressed image and "broadcast wave" [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]]/[[WAV]] sound, it explains the route to create an entire [[Digital Cinema Package]] (DCP) from a raw collection of files known as the Digital Cinema Distribution Master (DCDM), as well as the specifics of its content protection, [[encryption]], and [[forensic identification|forensic marking]].

The specification also establishes standards for the decoder requirements and the presentation environment itself, such as ambient light levels, [[pixel]] [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect]] and shape, image [[luminance]], [[white point]] [[chromaticity]], and those [[tolerance (engineering)|tolerances]] to be kept.

Even though it specifies what kind of information is required, the DCI Specification does not include specific information about how data within a distribution package is to be formatted. Formatting of this information is defined by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) digital cinema standards and related documents.{{Efn | As of 1 January 2018, the following fifty-six SMPTE engineering guidelines, recommended practices, registered disclosure documents and standards had been adopted and published:  • EG 432-1 Digital Source Processing - Color Processing for D-Cinema • EG 432-2 Digital Source Processing - D-Cinema Low Frequency Effects (LFE) Channel Audio Characteristics • RDD 20 Cinelink 2 Specification • RP 200 Relative and Absolute Sound Pressure Levels for Motion-Picture Multichannel Sound Systems - Applicable for Analog Photographic Film Audio, Digital Photographic Film Audio and D-Cinema • RP 428-4 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Audio File Format and Delivery Constraints • RP 428-5 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Mapping of Images into Constrained Tag Image File • RP 428-6 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Digital Leader • RP 431-2 D-Cinema Quality - Reference Projector and Environment • ST 336 Data Encoding Protocol Using Key-Length-Value • ST 337-1 Material Exchange Format (MXF) - File Format Specification • ST 377-4 MXF Multichannel Audio Labeling Framework • ST 379-1 Material Exchange Format (MXF) - MXF Generic Container • ST 379-2 For Television - Material Exchange Format (MXF) - MXF Constrained Generic Container • ST 382 Material Exchange Format - Mapping AES3 and Broadcast Wave Audio into the MXF Generic Container • ST 390 Material Exchange Format (MXF) - Specialized Operational Pattern ''OP-Atom'' (Simplified Representation of a Single Item) • ST 400 SMPTE Labels Structure • ST 410 Material Exchange Format - Generic Stream Partition • ST 422 Material Exchange Format - Mapping JPEG 2000 Codestreams into the MXF Generic Container • ST 427 Link Encryption for 1.5 Gb/s Serial Digital Interface • ST 428-1 D-Cinema Distribution Master (DCDM) - Image Characteristics • ST 428-2 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Audio Characteristics • ST 428-7 Digital Cinema Distribution Master - Subtitle • ST 428-9 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Image Pixel Structure Level 3 - Serial Digital Interface Signal Formatting • ST 428-10 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Closed Caption and Closed Subtitle • ST 428-11 Additional Frame Rates for D-Cinema • ST 428-12 D-Cinema Distribution Master Common Audio Channels and Soundfield Groups • ST 428-19 D-Cinema Distribution Master - Additional Frame Rates Level AFR2 and Level AFR4 - Serial Digital Interface Signal Formatting • ST 428-21 Archive Frame Rates for D-Cinema • ST 429-2 D-Cinema Packaging - DCP Operational Constraints • ST 429-3 D-Cinema Packaging - Sound and Picture Track File • ST 429-4 D-Cinema Packaging - MXF JPEG 2000 Application • ST 429-5 D-Cinema Packaging - Timed Text Track File • ST 429-6 D-Cinema Packaging - MXF Track File Essence Encryption • ST 429-7 D-Cinema Packaging - Composition Playlist • ST 429-8 D-Cinema Packaging - Packing List • ST 429-9 D-Cinema Packaging - Asset Mapping and File Segmentation • ST 429-10 D-Cinema Packaging - Stereoscopic Picture Track File • ST 429-12 D-Cinema Packaging - Caption and Closed Subtitle • ST 429-13 D-Cinema Packaging - DCP Operational Constraints for Additional Frame Rates • ST 429-14 D-Cinema Packaging - Aux Data Track File • ST 429-16 Additional Composition Metadata and Guidelines • ST 430-1 D-Cinema Operations - Key Delivery Message • ST 430-2 D-Cinema Operations - Digital Certificate • ST 430-3 D-Cinema Operations - Generic Extra-Theater Message Format • ST 430-4 D-Cinema Operations - Log Record Format Specification • ST 430-5 D-Cinema Packaging - Security Log Event Class and Constraints • ST 430-6 D-Cinema Operations - Auditorium Security Messages for Intra-Theater Communications • ST 430-9 D-Cinema Operations - Key Delivery Bundle • ST 430-10 D-Cinema Operations - Auxiliary Content Synchronization Protocol • ST 430-11 D-Cinema Operations - Auxiliary Resource Presentation List • ST 430-12 D-Cinema Operations - FSK Synchronization Signal • ST 430-14 D-Cinema Operations - Digital Sync Signal and Aux Data Transfer Protocol • ST 430-15 D-Cinema Operations - Facility List Message Exchange Protocol • ST 430-16 D-Cinema Operations - Extended Facility List Message • ST 431-1 D-Cinema Quality - Screen Luminance Level, Chromaticity and Uniformity • ST 433 D-Cinema - XML Data Types}}

The idea for DCI was originally mooted in late 1999 by [[Tom McGrath (media executive)|Tom McGrath]], then COO of [[Paramount Pictures]], who applied to the U.S. Department of Justice for anti-trust waivers to allow the joint cooperation of all seven major motion picture studios.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[Universal Pictures]] made one of the first feature-length DCPs created to DCI specifications, using their film ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = DCinemaToday | url = http://www.dcinematoday.com/dc/pr.aspx?newsID=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was not distributed theatrically, it had one public screening on November 7, 2005, at the USC Entertainment Technology Center's Digital Cinema Laboratory in the Pacific Theatre, Hollywood. ''[[Inside Man]]'' was Universal's first DCP commercial release, and, in addition to 35mm film distribution, was delivered via hard drive to 20 theatres in the [[United States]] along with two [[trailer (film)|trailers]].

The Academy Film Archive houses the Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC Collection, which includes film and digital elements from DCI’s Standard Evaluation Material (StEM), a 12-minute production shot on 35mm and 65mm film, created for vendors and standards organizations to test and evaluate image compression and digital projection technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC Collection|url=http://www.oscars.org/film-archive/collections/digital-cinema-initiatives-llc|website=Academy Film Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wielun.JPG|thumb|Vice CEO of the dairy [[cooperative]] (Spółdzielni Dostawców Mleka) from [[Wielun]], [[Bogdan Woźniak]] receives the ''Lider Forum 2008'' certificate from Janusz Górski, editor-in-chief of ''Forum Mleczarskie Handel''.]]

The [[bi-monthly]] '''''Forum Mleczarskie Handel''''' is the oldest [[Poland|Polish]] business magazine about the dairy products trade.&lt;ref&gt;which includes margarine products too&lt;/ref&gt; The title was the forerunner of a new kind of trade magazines focusing on category managers (purchasers and sellers) in the modern [[fast-moving consumer goods]] (FMCG) [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] trade in Poland. The title is quoted frequently by other Polish media.&lt;ref&gt;like in an [http://www.wprost.pl/ar/164415/Polski-rewanz/?O=164415&amp;pg=0 article] in the newsweekly ''[[Wprost]]'', issue 26/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Idea ==
The title was developed as a reaction of the rapidly changing FMCG trade sector in Poland since 1995. Tens of thousands of former small FMCG shops have been replaced by modern [[retail chain]]s, which has been followed by a change of professions in this industry: instead of generalists, specialists now rule the day. Such professions – new for Poland – created a demand for business information sources for the FMCG category. Readers of ''Forum Mleczarskie Handel'' are buyers and sales managers (dairy or fresh products) in headquarters and outlets of wholesale and retail chains like [[Auchan]], [[Biedronka]], [[Carrefour]], [[E.Leclerc]], [[Lidl]], [[MarcPol]], [[Makro|Makro Cash and Carry]], [[Netto (store)|Netto]], [[Real (hypermarket)|Real]], [[Tesco]] and others.

== Main editors ==
First editor-in-chief of the title was Karol Krajewski, a junior professor at [[Gdynia Maritime University]] (Akademia Morska w Gdyni), later head of the consulting department to the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Republic of Poland|Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development]] (Ministerstwo Rolnictwa i Rozwoju Wsi). Since January 2006 Janusz Górski runs the editorial team of all ''Forum Mleczarskie''-titles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kzsm.org.pl/index.php?page= article] at the website of the ''National Dairy Cooperatives Association''&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial advisory board actually has two members: Antoni Pluta, director of the biotechnology department of the [[Warsaw University of Life Science]] (Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie) and Maria Andrzej Faliński, president of the Polish trade organization ''POHID''.

In company law, '''fraudulent trading''' is doing business with intent to defraud [[creditor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 213 of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==
Where during the course of a [[Liquidation|winding-up]], it appears to the liquidator that fraudulent trading has occurred, the liquidator may apply to the court for an order any persons who were knowingly parties to the carrying on of such business are to be made liable to make such contributions (if any) to the company's assets as the court thinks proper.

Conceptually, fraudulent trading is similar to a [[fraudulent conveyance]],&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see section 423 of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt; but the key distinction is that an application to have a transaction set aside as a fraudulent conveyance usually requires to the third party beneficiary to disgorge the benefit of the conveyance to undo the loss to the company's assets, whereas a court order in relation to fraudulent trading it is the responsible parties (usually the [[board of directors|directors]]) who must make up the loss and the third party beneficiaries will usually retain the benefit. However, it is legally possible for a single transaction to be simultaneously fraudulent trading and a fraudulent conveyance, and to be the subject on concurrent applications. Some legal systems permit a director who makes a contribution to the company's assets pursuant to an order for fraudulent trading to [[subrogation|subrogated]] to any claim that the company might have with respect to a fraudulent conveyance.

In practice, applications for orders in respect of fraudulent trading are rare because of the high [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] associated with [[fraud]]. Usually, even where fraudulent trading is suspected, an application is made with respect to an allegation of "[[wrongful trading]]" (or "insolvent trading") where the burden of proof is lower. Where applications are brought for fraudulent trading, it is usually because when the trading occurred, the company was not insolvent at that time (insolvency at the time of the trading is normally a requirement to establish wrongful trading, but not fraudulent trading).

The effect of a successful application for fraudulent trading varies between different legal systems. In some countries, the assets contributed by the directors are treated as general assets which may be taken by any [[secured creditor]]s who may have a [[security interest]] which attaches to all the company's assets (characteristically, a [[floating charge]]). However, some countries have "ring-fenced" payments made for fraudulent trading so that they are made available to the pool of assets for [[unsecured creditor]]s.

Fraudulent trading is entirely separate and distinct from "[[insider trading]]", which focuses purely upon the abuse of inside information in relation to financial markets for personal financial gain, and is wholly unrelated to creditor's rights or insolvency law.

As a simulation, the game and the direction of the company is controlled by the player, following a parallel timeline of the [[video game industry]] and [[History of video games|its history]]. The game was released to positive reviews, with many reviewers focusing on ''Game Dev Story''{{'}}s addictive aspects and its witty references to video game [[popular culture|pop culture]].

== Gameplay ==
[[File:GameDevscreen.png|thumb|upright|left|The menu on the left-hand side of the screen allows the player to control the direction of their game studio, while the bottom menu row shows the sales of their currently released game.]]

The player takes control of a start-up [[video game developer]], with the goal of making hit titles and consoles in order to make money.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; The user controls a number of factors which can help or hinder the quality of the games released, including hiring staff, controlling the direction and speed of development, and using items which give boosts for workers or change their jobs. As the player progresses and earns more money, their building is improved upon and they are allowed to hire more staff, and thus create better games.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;

Games are assigned review scores upon completion of a game ranging from 1–10 with a comment from the associated reviewer with his score. The scores generally affect the sales that go along with the game, and as they are in real life, sales are ranked with a number according to how they sold that week.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;

When the player reaches the Hall of Fame level, they can hire more staff. To reach the Hall of Fame, the player needs to get the critics to give a score of at least 32.

''Game Dev Story'' received positive reviews, praising the addictiveness of its mechanics and its somewhat realistic treatment of video game development. It received an 86/100 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt; ''[[The A.V.

Criticism of the game mostly focused on the end-period of the game.

The '''IT interaction model''' is a [[holistic]] view of [[Management Information Systems]] in the context of the organization. According to [[Mark S. Silver]], the model addresses the interaction of an information system's features with five elements of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

#Its external environment
#Its strategy
#Its structure and culture
#Its business processes
#Its IT infrastructure.

The model considers the consequences of this interaction for system use, for organizational performance, for the organization's personnel, and for the firm's future flexibility. Moreover, the model relates various aspects of the interaction process to the phases of the development and implementation lifecycles.

Tools such as [[Porter's five forces]], value chain analysis and [[SWOT analysis]] can be used to analyze a company's strategy. Information flow diagrams can be used to analyze a company's business processes.

{{Accounting}}
In [[accountancy|accounting]], the '''Inventory turnover''' is a measure of the number of times inventory is sold or used in a time period such as a year. It is calculated to see if a business has an excessive inventory in comparison to its sales level. The [[equation]] for inventory turnover equals the [[cost of goods sold]] divided by the average [[inventory]].  Inventory turnover is also known as '''inventory turns''', '''merchandise turnover''', '''stockturn''', '''stock turns''', '''turns''', and '''stock turnover'''.

==Inventory Turnover Formulas==
The formula for inventory turnover:

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Inventory Turnover}=\frac{\mbox{Net Sales}}{\mbox{Average Inventory}} &lt;/math&gt;

or

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Inventory Turnover}=\frac{\mbox{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\mbox{Average Inventory}} &lt;/math&gt;

or

:: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Inventory Turnover}=\frac{\mbox{Cost of Material − Change in inventories (of 1/2 and 1/1 goods)}}{\mbox{Inventories}} &lt;/math&gt;

The ''most basic'' formula for average inventory:

:: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Average Inventory}=\frac{\mbox{Beginning inventory+Ending inventory}}{\mbox{2}} &lt;/math&gt;

or just

:: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Average Inventory}=\mbox{Ending inventory} &lt;/math&gt;

Multiple data points, for example the average of the monthly averages, will provide a much more representative turn figure.


The average days to sell the inventory is calculated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Weygandt, J. J., Kieso, D. E., &amp; Kell, W. G. (1996). ''Accounting Principles'' (4th ed.). New York, Chichester, Brisbane, Toronto, Singapore: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.  p. 802.&lt;/ref&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Average days to sell the inventory}=\frac{\mbox{365 days}}{\mbox{Inventory Turnover Ratio}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Application in Business ==
A low turnover rate may point to overstocking,&lt;ref&gt;Commercial Loan Analysis: principles and techniques for credit analysts and lenders By Kenneth R. Pirok
 {{ISBN|1-55738-716-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; obsolescence, or deficiencies in the product line or marketing effort. However, in some instances a low rate may be appropriate, such as where higher inventory levels occur in anticipation of rapidly rising prices or expected market shortages.

Conversely a high turnover rate may indicate inadequate inventory levels, which may lead to a loss in business as the inventory is too low. This often can result in stock shortages.

Some compilers of industry data (e.g., [[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]]) use sales as the numerator instead of cost of sales. [[Cost of sales]] yields a more realistic turnover ratio, but it is often necessary to use sales for purposes of comparative analysis. Cost of sales is considered to be more realistic because of the difference in which sales and the cost of sales are recorded.  Sales are generally recorded at market value, i.e. the value at which the marketplace paid for the good or service provided by the firm.  In the event that the firm had an exceptional year and the market paid a premium for the firm's goods and services then the numerator may be an inaccurate measure.  However, cost of sales is recorded by the firm at what the firm actually paid for the materials available for sale.  Additionally, firms may reduce prices to generate sales in an effort to cycle inventory.  In this article, the terms "cost of sales" and "cost of goods sold" are synonymous.

An item whose inventory is sold (turns over) once a year has higher holding cost than one that turns over twice, or three times, or more in that time. Stock turnover also indicates the briskness of the business. The purpose of increasing inventory turns is to reduce inventory for three reasons.
* Increasing inventory turns reduces [[holding cost]]. The organization spends less money on rent, utilities, insurance, theft and other costs of maintaining a stock of good to be sold.
* Reducing [[holding cost]] increases [[net income]] and [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] as long as the [[revenue]] from selling the item remains constant.
* Items that turn over more quickly increase responsiveness to changes in customer requirements while allowing the replacement of obsolete items.  This is a major concern in fashion  industries.
* When making comparison between firms, it's important to take note of the industry, or the comparison will be distorted. Making comparison between a supermarket and a car dealer, will not be appropriate, as supermarket sells fast-moving goods such as sweets, chocolates, soft drinks so the stock turnover will be higher. However, a car dealer will have a low turnover due to the item being a slow moving item. As such only intra-industry comparison will be appropriate.

==Note==
Some computer programs measure the stock turns of an item using the actual number sold.

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Inventory  Turn} = \frac{\text{Number  of  Units  Sold  (Over  a  given  period)}}{\text{Average  Number of  Units  (For  the  period)}}&lt;/math&gt;

The important issue is that any organization should be consistent in the formula that it uses.

'''Dr. Ivo Stern''' (24 December 1889 – 1961) was Croatian lawyer, writer, journalist, director and founder of the "Zagreb Radiostation" (now [[Croatian Radiotelevision]]).&lt;ref name="žz"&gt;{{harvtxt|Snješka Knežević|2011|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nacional2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/14093/zidovi-koji-su-izgradili-moderni-zagreb |title=Židovi koji su izgradili moderni Zagreb |date=15 February 2005 |issue=483 |first1=Robert |last1=Bajruši |first2=Marina |last2=Biluš |first3=Viktor |last3=Zahtila |publisher=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]] |language=Croatian |accessdate=4 July 2012 |trans-title=Jews who built modern Zagreb |archivedate=4 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68u49L46k?url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/14093/zidovi-koji-su-izgradili-moderni-zagreb |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stern was born to a wealthy [[Jew]]ish family on 24 December 1889 in [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="žz"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nacional2/&gt; He studied and graduated at the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Zagreb]] in 1913. After graduation, he practiced the law for a while. After [[World War I]], in which he participated as a soldier in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], Stern lived in [[Vienna]]. In 1926 as the head of the Zagreb group of bankers and industrials, despite the opposition from [[Belgrade]], Stern founded the "Zagreb Radiostation". Stern was first director and major shareholder of the "Zagreb Radiostation". He was also the program editor until 1938. Stern was close friend of Croatian writer [[Milan Begović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Usp. podatke iz radova N. Vončine, nav. u bilj. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Usp.

Distinctly higher in education, polyglot, charming and elegant, financially independent, Stern fraternize with many Croatian writers. His apartment in Jurišićeva street was a place of elegant banquets. He was a member of the Croatian [[Freemasonry]] and founder of the elite "Rotary Club" which had predominantly Masonic membership.&lt;ref name="nb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Nikola Batušić; Neke podatke o Ivi Sternu dugujem svome ocu dr.

Ivani Batušić (1912), koja je sredinom tridesetih godina upoznala Sterna.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stern wrote left pacifist oriented emphatic expressive poetry, which was published in the magazine "Plamen". He also wrote political [[feuilleton]]s. One of his feuilletons was devoted to the problem of the Jewish diaspora in the new post-war Europe, for which he was criticized and accused that he represents the [[Jewish messianism]] of [[Bolshevik]]s, [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Béla Kun]].&lt;ref name="nb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} O smislu lutanja — problem jevrejske rase — politički feljton, br. 9, str. 85 — 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Usp. bilj. br. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eve of [[World War II]], Stern changed his surname to Globnik and moved to Italy where he died in 1961.&lt;ref name="nb"/&gt;

'''José Sulaimán Chagnón''' (May 30, 1931 – January 16, 2014) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[boxing]] official. He was the president of the [[World Boxing Council]].

==Biography==
Sulaimán's father was of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]&lt;ref name=Televisa&gt;[http://televisadeportes.esmas.com/box/678721/muere-don-jose-sulaiman/ Muere Don José Sulaimán]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Excelsior&gt;[http://www.excelsior.com.mx/adrenalina/2014/01/17/938750 José Sulaimán, presidente del CMB, murió a los 82 años de edad]&lt;/ref&gt; descent and his mother of [[Syria]]n&lt;ref name=Televisa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Excelsior/&gt; descent and he was born in [[Ciudad Victoria]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]. Sulaimán boxed as an amateur and had served as a trainer, promoter, referee, and judge. However, he was best known as an administrator for more than three decades. At the age of 16, he was on the boxing commission in [[San Luis Potosí]], Mexico. In 1968, he joined the World Boxing Council (WBC) and quickly moved through the ranks. On December 5, 1975, Sulaiman was unanimously elected president of the WBC and had served in that capacity until the time of his death.

Under Sulaiman's leadership, the WBC had instituted many new rules and regulations regarding boxers' safety and welfare. Among the changes was the reduction of world championship bouts from 15 [[Professional_boxing#Length_of_bouts|rounds]] to 12, the official weigh-in taking place 24 hours prior to each bout, the creation of intermediate [[Boxing weight classes|weight divisions]], the creation of the World Medical Congress, the introduction of the attached [[boxing gloves|thumb glove]] and the funding of brain injury research programs at [[UCLA]]. During Sulaiman's tenure, the WBC sanctioned over 1,100 title bouts and 300 boxers won world titles. Truly a worldwide organization, Sulaiman had expanded the WBC's global reach to include 161 affiliated nations.

Outside of boxing, Sulaiman, who spoke Spanish, English, Arabic, Italian, Portuguese and French, successfully operated a medical supply company in Mexico. 

He was inducted into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] on June 10, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/nonparticipant/sulaiman.html International Boxing Hall of Fame].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/392675.html El Universal]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Sulaiman was also a very controversial figure. Journalist Matthew Hurley wrote,  "How he was ever voted into the International Boxing Hall Of Fame is beyond me." &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130122045818/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/weblog/news.php?p=12576&amp;more=1 ''East Side Boxing'' September 26, 2007].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sulaiman had been accused of corruption numerous times. For example, many in the boxing community had accused the WBC of bending its rules to suit promoter [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]]. The late journalist [[Jack Newfield]] wrote that Sulaiman "became more King's junior partner than his independent regulator." &lt;ref name=Newfield&gt;{{cite book|last=Newfield|first=Jack|title=Only In America|publisher=William &amp; Morrow Co.|year=1995| location= New York, New York|pages=141|isbn=0-688-10123-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another journalist, Peter Heller, echoed that comment, writing, "Sulaiman...became little more than an errand boy for Don King." Heller quoted British promoter [[Mickey Duff]] as saying, "My complaint is that José Sulaimán is not happy his friend Don King is the biggest promoter in boxing. Sulaiman will only be happy when Don King is the ''only'' promoter in boxing." &lt;ref name=Heller&gt;{{cite book|last=Heller|first=Peter|title=Bad Intentions: The Mike Tyson Story| publisher=New American Library|year=1988|location=New York, New York|pages=143|isbn=0-688-10123-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Pernell Whitaker]] lost a controversial decision to [[Jose Luis Ramirez]] in 1988, Whitaker's trainer, [[Lou Duva]], called Sulaiman "a thief" and Whitaker's manager, [[Shelly Finkel]], said, "King and Sulaiman fixed the fight, no question about it." &lt;ref&gt;''Knockout'' magazine (Fall 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/20/sports/sports-of-the-times-holyfield-a-stand-up-champion.html ''The New York Times'' December 20, 1990].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Sulaimán died at the age of 82 in Los Angeles on January 16, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aztecanoticias.com.mx/notas/sociedad-y-medio-ambiente/179981/jose-sulaiman-presidente-del-cmb-murio |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201105957/http://www.aztecanoticias.com.mx/notas/sociedad-y-medio-ambiente/179981/jose-sulaiman-presidente-del-cmb-murio |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in the [[Panteón Francés]] of Mexico City.&lt;ref name=Excelsior /&gt;

'''Johann Ludwig Knoop''' (15 May 1821 in [[Bremen]] - 14 August 1894 in Bremen) was a [[cotton]] merchant and entrepreneur from the city-state [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]], who became one of the richest entrepreneurs in his time. He was created a [[Baron]] by [[Alexander II of Russia]].
 
He studied in Bremen, and learned the cotton business at [[Manchester]] with the Bremen-born cotton exporter Johan Frerichs's company De Jersey &amp; Co. He went to [[Moscow]] as assistant to the firm's agent Franz Holzhauer in 1840. That year he established the first power-driven [[cotton mill]] in [[Russia]].

In 1842, the British ban on the export of cotton machinery, imposed in 1775 to protect the country's [[head start (positioning)|head start]] in technology, was lifted, allowing the manufacture of cotton to expand in Russia.  Knoop used English credit to build and fit out mills with English equipment. The commissioning in 1847 of Morozov's Nikolsk mill at [[Orekhovo-Zuyevo]], Knoop's sixth, was seen as a landmark in the industry's development in Russia.

In 1852, he founded L Knoop &amp; Co, in association with De Jersey and the machinery manufacturer [[Platt Brothers]] of [[Oldham]], [[Lancashire]]. In 1857, he built the largest cotton spinning mill in Europe on the island of [[Kreenholm]] at [[Narva]], [[Estonia]], which employed 4500 people. The [[Krenholm Manufacturing Company]]'s factory in Narva had nearly half a million spindles driven by water-power. It paid low wages, but took its responsibilities to its workforce seriously, introducing a [[health insurance]] scheme and supplying workers with dwellings, kindergartens, and schools.

Eventually, he was responsible for equipping 187 cotton mills on Russian territory. However, Knoop came under attack from the Russian Technical Society for retarding industrial development in the country. This was because he relied exclusively on English machinery and also supplied the factories with English managers, technicians, and supervisors. He was created a baron by [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]] in 1877. 

He died on 16 August 1894 at St Magnus, Bremen, where a city park created from his estate is named after him. His descendants include [[Ernst Albrecht (politician)|Ernst Albrecht]], [[Hans-Holger Albrecht]]  and [[Ursula von der Leyen]].

Strictly speaking, '''matrix management''', which was "introduced in the 1970s in the context of competition"&lt;ref&gt;from Japanese companies
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mat2007&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Matrix Organization Reloaded: Adventures in Team and Project Management
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0275991334   |isbn=0275991334
|author=Marvin R. Gottlieb  |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the practice of managing individuals with more than one reporting line (in a matrix [[organization structure]]), but it is also commonly used to describe managing cross functional, cross business group and other forms of working that cross the traditional vertical business units – often silos – of function and geography.

==What is it?==
It is a type of organizational [[structure]] in which people with similar skills are pooled for work assignments, resulting in more than one manager (sometimes referred to as solid line and dotted line reports, in reference to traditional business [[organization charts]]).


Matrix Management is also referred to as a command – and- control status, in which some of the employees have more than one responsibility or even bosses. These particular employees have to report to one boss for that day (a project manager) so they can perform those specific duties. Then the employee will have to report to another boss at a different department for practical responsibilities. The uses and methods Matrix Management is knowing to have the best requirements for situations that vary from workloads. An example of this would be managing large collaboratives or product development tasks. 


For example, all [[engineer]]s may be in one engineering department and report to an engineering manager, but these same engineers may be assigned to different projects and report to a different engineering manager or a project manager while working on that project.&lt;ref name="Tara"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/successful-organizational-structure-58347.html|title=Successful Organizational Structure|author=Tara Duggan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"employees report to more than one manager... combines both functional and divisional structures."&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, each engineer may have to work under several managers to get his or her job done.

===The matrix for project management===
A lot of the early literature on the matrix comes from the field of cross functional [[project management]] where matrices are described as strong, medium or weak depending on the level of power of the project manager.

While some form of matrix management has become fairly common in certain industries, particularly among companies that have multiple business units and international operations, upon closer inspection, different organizations implement a matrix structure in different ways to support their needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|first1=Kristin M. |last1=Neff |first2=Ralph D. |last2=White
|url=http://www.diaglobal.org/tools/viewer.aspx?type=eopdf&amp;file=/productfiles/17090/08026.pdf
|title=REDEFINING PROJECT MANAGEMENT IN A MATRIX ENVIRONMENT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations fall somewhere between the fully [[functional organization|functional]] and the pure matrix.  These organizations are defined in ''[[A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge]]&lt;ref&gt;Seet, Daniel. [http://www.pmhut.com/power-the-functional-manager-meat-and-project-manager-poison "Power: The Functional Manager’s Meat and Project Manager’s Poison?"], ''PM Hut'', February 6, 2009. Retrieved on March 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;'' as ’composite’.  For example, even a fundamentally functional organization may create a special project team to handle a critical project.

The traditional organisation has some functions that may have names such as design, development, manufacturing, finance, HR, marketing, sales, customer service, etc. The common factor of these functions is that they are bounded, contain specialists and are managed by people who have a specialist outlook. They are a linear hierarchy that, no matter how modern the management thinking is, is fundamentally command and control - now socially modernised. Matrix management cannot be command and control. Today the most successful companies are those where top executives recognise the need to manage the new environmental and competitive demands by focusing on developing the abilities, behaviour and performance of individual managers.The organisation will need leaders and that requires interpersonal communication. Change succeeds only when those assigned to the new trans-functional and interdependent tasks understand the overall goals and are dedicated to achieving them.

==Management advantages and disadvantages==
Key advantages that organizations seek when introducing a matrix include:
* To break business [[information silo]]s - to increase cooperation and communication across the traditional silos and unlock resources and talent that are currently inaccessible to the rest of the organization.  
* To deliver work across the business more effectively – to serve global customers, manage supply chains that extend outside the organization, and run integrated business regions, functions and processes.    
* To be able to respond more flexibly – to reflect the importance of both the global and the local, the business and the function in the structure, and to respond quickly to changes in markets and priorities. 
* To develop broader people capabilities – a matrix helps develop individuals with broader perspectives and skills who can deliver value across the business and manage in a more complex and interconnected environment.

Key disadvantages of matrix organizations include:
*  Mid-level management having multiple supervisors can be confusing, in that competing agendas and emphases can pull employees in different directions, which can lower productivity. 
*  Mid-level management can become frustrated with what appears to be a lack of clarity with priorities.
*  Mid-level management can become over-burdened with the diffusion of priorities. 
*  Supervisory management can find it more difficult to achieve results within their area of expertise with subordinate staff being pulled in different directions.

===Advantages and disadvantages in a project management situation===
The advantages of a matrix for project management can include:
* Individuals can be chosen according to the needs of the project.
* The use of a project team that is dynamic and able to view problems in a different way as specialists have been brought together in a new environment.
* Project managers are directly responsible for completing the project within a specific deadline and budget.
* Is know by many to be one of the more effetive ways to manage the progress of new products and or services. 

The disadvantages for project management can include:
* A conflict of loyalty between line managers and project managers over the allocation of resources.
* Projects can be difficult to monitor if teams have a lot of independence.
* Costs can be increased if more managers (i.e. project managers) are created through the use of project teams.
* Organizational efficiencies are very difficult to identify because benchmarking headcount against revenue (or output) is not possible due to the scattered nature of the support
* Teaxas Insturments well know for making cardiac pacemakers, had stop using the management technique in the eighties. Supportting one of the reasons was due to economic decline.

===In popular culture===

* An example of matrix-style management can be seen when Peter Gibbons messes up his [[TPS report|TPS reports]] in the movie ''[[Office Space]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3000584/9-ways-great-companies-organize-their-teams-success|website=FastCompany.com|title=9 Ways Great Companies Organize Their Teams For Success}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Matrix Management in Practice==
Examples of using Matrix Management:

* [[ABB Group]], formed from a 1988 merger and followed by "an ambitious acquisition program." Guiding this was a corporate structure whereby "local operations were organized within the framework of a two-dimensional matrix."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|first1=William J.   |last1=Kettinger |first2=Donald A. |last2=Marchand |date=February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for why the term is not publicly and formally affiliated with large numbers of corporations, a 2007 book about how "matrix management made a big splash in the 1970s" said that, "for the most part... companies using matrix structures tend to keep quiet about it."&lt;ref name=Mat2007/&gt;

==Current Thinking on Matrix Management==
In 1990 Christopher A. Bartlett and Sumantra Ghoshal writing on matrix management in the [http://hbr.org Harvard Business Review],&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/1990/07/matrix-management-not-a-structure-a-frame-of-mind/ar/1 Matrix management: not a structure, a frame of mind.] Barlett CA, Ghoshal S, Harvard Business Review [1990, 68(4):138-145]&lt;/ref&gt; quoted a line manager saying “The challenge is not so much to build a matrix structure as it is to create a matrix in the minds of our managers”. Despite this, most academic work has focused on structure, where most practitioners seem to struggle with the skills and behaviours needed to make matrix management a success. Most of the disadvantages are about the way people work together, not the structure.

In “Designing Matrix Organizations That Actually Work” [http://www.jaygalbraith.com Jay R. Galbraith]&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith, J.R. (1971). [http://www.jaygalbraith.com/component/rsfiles/download?path=whitepapers%252Fgalbraithmatrix1971.pdf "Matrix Organization Designs: How to combine functional and project forms".] In: ''Business Horizons'', February 1971, 29-40.&lt;/ref&gt; says “Organization structures do not fail, but management fails at implementing them successfully.” He argues that strategy, structure, processes, rewards and people all need to be aligned in a successful matrix implementation.

In “Making the Matrix Work: How Matrix Managers Engage People and Cut through Complexity”, [http://www.global-integration.com/about-us/key-consultants/kevan-hall/ Kevan Hall]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.global-integration.com/matrix-management/making-matrix-work-book/ “Making the Matrix Work: How Matrix Managers Engage People and Cut Through Complexity”], by Kevan Hall {{ISBN|1904838421}} | {{ISBN|978-1904838425}} |&lt;/ref&gt;  identifies a number of specific matrix management challenges in an environment where accountability without control, and influence without authority, become the normal way of working:
* Context - matrix managers need to make sure that people understand the reasoning behind matrix working and change their behaviours accordingly
* Cooperation - a matrix is intended to improve cooperation across the silos, but it can easily lead to an increase in bureaucracy, more meetings and slower decisions where too many people are involved.
* Control - In a matrix managers are often dependent on strangers where they don't have direct control. There are many factors that can undermine trust such as cross cultural differences and communicating through technology and when trust is undermined managers often increase control. Centralization can make the matrix slow and expensive to run with high levels of escalation. Matrix managers need to directly build trust in distributed and diverse teams and to empower people, even though they may rarely get face-to-face.
* Community – the formal structure becomes less important to getting things done in a matrix so managers need to focus on the "soft structure" of networks, communities, teams and groups that need to be set up and maintained to get things done.

Paula K. Martin, in her books [https://www.matrixmanagementinstitute.com/bookstore/mm-20-body-knowledge The Matrix Management 2.0 Body of Knowledge]&lt;ref name="Matrix Management 2.0 Body of Knowledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Paula|title=Matrix Management 2.0™ Body of Knowledge|date=2013|publisher=International Matrix Management Institute|isbn=0988334208|pages=236|edition=1|url=https://www.matrixmanagementinstitute.com/bookstore/mm-20-body-knowledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [https://www.matrixmanagementinstitute.com/getting-started/matrix-management-reinvented-new-game Matrix Management Reinvented – The New Game in Town],&lt;ref name="Matrix Management Reinvented: Book 1 - The New Game In Town"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Paula|title=Matrix Management Reinvented: Book 1 - The New Game in Town|date=2015|publisher=International Matrix Management Institute|isbn=0988334216|pages=97|edition=1|url=https://www.matrixmanagementinstitute.com/getting-started/matrix-management-reinvented-new-game}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of Matrix Management 2.0, an organizational operating System that focuses on running a matrix organization from two dimensions – the horizontal and the vertical.

MM 2.0 is defined in Matrix Management Reinvented – The New Game in Town as “A management operating system specifically designed to make a matrix organization function effectively and efficiently.”&lt;ref name="Matrix Management Reinvented: Book 1 - The New Game In Town" /&gt; This new system updates other organizational operating systems such as Vertical Management 1.0 which is a one-dimensional, authority based system invented in the 1950s, and the Matrix Management (1.0) system that is focused on creating a specific matrix structure and authority based relationships with dual-reporting or dotted-line relationships on an Org Chart.&lt;ref name="Matrix Management Reinvented: Book 1 - The New Game In Town" /&gt;

Matrix Management 2.0 is based on a new set of assumptions that change how we look at the organization as a system and matrix leadership.

MM 2.0 Organizational Assumptions, as defined in Matrix Management Reinvented – The New Game in Town:&lt;ref name="Matrix Management Reinvented: Book 1 - The New Game In Town" /&gt;
* An organization is a system; therefore, the parts (areas and people) are interdependent
* The whole is equal to the product of the interaction of the parts
* Optimization of an organization is best accomplished using cooperation
* Team performance is what is important

MM 2.0 Leadership Assumptions, as defined in Matrix Management Reinvented – The New Game in Town:&lt;ref name="Matrix Management Reinvented: Book 1 - The New Game In Town" /&gt;
* Leaders do not need authority in order to lead and be accountable

The MM 2.0 system is broken up into five SPARC Keys that cover the different aspects organizations address when they apply matrix management – Structure, Productivity, Accountability, Relationship Management and Collaborative Leadership. With MM 2.0, each Key follows the premises and principles based upon the new assumptions.&lt;ref name="Matrix Management Reinvented: Book 1 - The New Game In Town" /&gt;

SPARC Keys, as defined in Matrix Management Reinvented – The New Game in Town:&lt;ref name="Matrix Management Reinvented: Book 1 - The New Game In Town" /&gt;
* S Key – Horizontal &amp; vertical structure
* P Key – Productivity of the team &amp; organization
* A Key – Proactive and commitment-focused accountability system
* R Key – Management of non-authority horizontal relationships
* C Key – Collaborative leadership without authority

==Visual representation==
Representing matrix organizations visually has challenged managers ever since the matrix management structure was invented.  Most organizations use dotted lines to represent secondary relationships between people, and charting software such as Visio and OrgPlus supports this approach.  Until recently, [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) and [[human resource management systems]] (HRMS) software did not support matrix reporting.  Late releases of [[SAP AG|SAP]] software support matrix reporting, and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] eBusiness Suite can also be customized to store matrix information.

==Clarification==
Matrix management should not be confused with "tight matrix". Tight matrix, or co-location, refers to locating offices for a project team in the same room, regardless of management structure.

'''Michael Cherney''' ({{lang-he-n|מיכאל צ'רנוי}}, {{lang-ru|Михаил Чёрный}}, also '''Mikhail Chernoy''', '''Mikhail Chorny''' or '''Mikhail Chernoi'''; born 16 January 1952) is a Uzbekistan-born [[Israel]]i entrepreneur and industrialist. He is known for his significant role in the 1990s Aluminium in Russia, and his business ventures in Israel. He is also the founder of the [[Michael Cherney Foundation]] and a sponsor of [[The Intelligence Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/jacobs010206.html "Kenneth Timmerman's Iranian 'Democracy' and the 'Intelligence' Summit"], Ron Jacobs, February 1, 2006 (Monthly Review Zine website)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "SPT-2007"&gt;{{cite news |author=Meg Laughlin |title=Intelligence conference draws criticism |newspaper=[[The St. Petersburg Times]] |date=6 March 2007 |page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Cherney grew up in [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbek SSR]], in a family whose father was a book-keeper and an engineer, the eldest of three sons. At the age of fourteen, Cherney started working, as he joined his father on moonlighting jobs. After [[high school]], he was drafted into the [[Soviet Army]] and attended a technical college. Later, his athletic pursuits – boxing and football – led to employment in sports administration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In the early 1990s Cherney immigrated to [[Israel]] but kept close ties to Bulgaria, where he had bought a leading newspaper, a top [[association football| football]] team and Bulgaria's only mobile phone company, [[Mobiltel]]. In August 2000 Bulgarian authorities denounced what they said were his ties to foreign criminal rackets and expelled him, saying he could not return to Bulgaria for 10 years.&lt;ref name="NYT-Intrigue"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/03/business/intrigue-derails-a-public-offering-israel-halts-sale-of-phone-company.html |title=Intrigue Derails A Public Offering; Israel Halts Sale of Phone Company |author=William A. Orme Jr. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 April 2001 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the United States has "denied Cherney a visa since 1999 because of alleged ties to the Russian mafia, according to ''[[The St. Petersburg Times]]''".&lt;ref name= "SPT-2007"/&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2014|reason=Impossible citation; the PDF of this paper  http://www.sptimes.ru/archive/pdf/1251.pdf  doesn't have this story!}}

Cherney is wanted on an [[Interpol]] international arrest warrant on allegations of [[money laundering]] and organised crime, but in June 2010 ''The Jerusalem Post'' reported that Cherney is preparing an application to contest it before the European Union Court of Human Rights.&lt;ref name="Interpol"&gt;[http://www.interpol.int/public/Data/Wanted/Notices/Data/2009/42/2009_21842.asp Wanted: CHERNEY, Michael] ''[[Interpol]]''{{dead link|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jpost.com"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jonny Paul |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/British-High-Court-to-decide-Can-Cherney-testify-by-video |title=British High Court to decide: Can Cherney testify by video? |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=23 June 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010 the Israeli TV Channel Two aired a short program about the most expensive and lavish wedding ceremony in Israel until that time, costing 20 million ILS  (about 5 million US dollars). The program revealed that the bride was Cherny's daughter, that the wedding was paid by him and that Israeli ministers and members of parliament (Knesset) of Russian origin attended.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPFj6E-0NKk The most expensive wedding in Israel] (Hebrew, TV Channel 2 Israel account on YouTube)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business interests==

===TWG and founding of the Russian aluminium industry===
Cherney, together with his brother [[Lev Cherney]] and UK metals traders [[David and Simon Reuben]], founded [[Trans-World Group]] (TWG) – the first and largest private company in Russia, which produced [[aluminium]] and sold it on Western markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/03/russia | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=First oligarch claims his due | date=3 June 2007 | accessdate=12 October 2014 | first=Simon | last=Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''BusinessWeek'' reports that the brothers "were known for their rough style of doing business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Grabbing a corner on Russian aluminum |author=Julia Flynn |author2=Patricia Kranz |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |date=15 September 1996 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/1996-09-15/grabbing-a-corner-on-russian-aluminum-intl-edition |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, TWG was drawn into a government inquiry into the theft of more than $US100 million from Russia's central bank by a number of separate criminal groups during the early 1990s. In an article on TWG, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine reported: "That a theft occurred is not in dispute, nor is the fact that the Cherneys ended up with a piece of the stolen money and used it to partially fund Trans World's startup phase in 1992.... The inquiry's objective was to determine whether the Cherneys knew the funds were indeed stolen."&lt;ref name="Fortune200006-12"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/06/12/281972/index.htm |title=Capitalism In A Cold Climate |author=Richard Behar |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=12 June 2000 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to clean up its reputation and refute allegations of questionable business practices, the [[Reuben brothers]] hired [[Mayer Brown|Mayer Brown &amp; Platt]], a US-based law firm. Terrence Burke, an investigator employed by the law firm and former acting head of the DEA, recommended that the Reubens sever their ties with Cherney after the [[FBI]] told him that "it believed Michael himself was an organised crime figure." As a result, Michael was paid $US400 million "just to go away" while his brother Lev remained with the company.&lt;ref name="Fortune200006-12" /&gt;

In August 2001 a ''Fortune'' article notes, "the prosecutor's office in [[Düsseldorf]] notified the [[Reuben brothers]] that it had terminated its probe into alleged money laundering, saying 'I hereby confirm expressly that there is no remaining suspicion of money laundering or any other criminal actions.'" However, the same article states that the Kroll report "doesn't discuss an essential part of the story", nor does it "explore the complex business and financial relationships in Russia between the Reubens and Lev and Michael Chernoy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/06/12/281972/index.htm#update |title=David and Simon Reuben: Update and Clarification |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date=12 July 2004 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SuAl and partnership with Oleg Deripaska===
According to the Financial Times, in 1994, [[Oleg Deripaska]], then an independent metals trader, won the backing of Cherney and TWG to become general manager of Sayansk aluminium plant in Siberia, which lead to formation of SibAl and a partnership between Cherney and Oleg Deripaska in this company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |author=Catherine Belton |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/70a1c458-09ff-11df-8b23-00144feabdc0.html |title=Rusal: A lingering heat |newspaper=[[Financial Times]]}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Catherine Belton |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/36fa2390-7e35-11de-8f8d-00144feabdc0.html |title=Russian tycoon loses legal fight over Rusal |newspaper=[[Financial Times]]}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BulgarTabac===
In 2002, 80% of the capital in the Bulgarian State-owned tobacco company, [[Bulgartabac]], was placed on the market. In April 2002 Cherney put together a three-partner consortium called "Metatabac" to bid for Bulgartabac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ivan Vatahov |url=http://sofiaecho.com/2002/08/22/635474_metatabac-still-in-the-game |title=Metatabac still in the game |newspaper=[[Sofia Echo]] |date=22 August 2002 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership was structured between three groups: the Russian firm Soyuzcontracttabac, which owned 35%, MCG Holdings, a firm owned by Cherney, which owned 35%, and another 30% held by a [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] company named Metacontact Ltd.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Mobiltel===
In 2002 Cherney was involved in the selling-on of the [[Bulgaria]]n mobile provider [[Mobiltel]]. Cherney bought the company together with Austrian business men [[Martin Schlaff]], former minister of the [[Austrian People's Party]] [[Josef Taus]], and financial expert [[Herbert Cordt]]. The 768 million Euro deal was financed by [[BAWAG P.S.K.]]. In 2005 Mobiltel was sold for 1.6 billion euros to [[Mobilkom Austria|Mobilkom Austria Group]] with a huge profit of 830 million Euros.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100621011505/http://www.salzburg.com/sn/06/09/22/artikel/2447799.html Schlaff, Elsner, Birdie und Telekom]&lt;/ref&gt; Critics found it hard to understand "why the state bought an asset for such a high price from someone who was effectively a go-between who stood to pocket a fat profit, rather than directly from the original owner of the company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gidi Weitz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/special-report-the-schlaff-saga/the-schlaff-saga-a-witness-but-not-a-suspect-1.312802 |title=The Schlaff Saga / A witness, but not a suspect |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=7 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917225323/http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/special-report-the-schlaff-saga/the-schlaff-saga-a-witness-but-not-a-suspect-1.312802 |archivedate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Intelligence Summit==
Cherney is the founder and primary sponsor of the Intelligence Summit.&lt;ref name= "SPT-2007"/&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2014|reason=Impossible citation; the PDF of this paper  http://www.sptimes.ru/archive/pdf/1251.pdf  doesn't have this story!}} In February 2006, ''The New York Sun'' reported that [[John Deutch]] and [[James Woolsey]] had resigned from the [[Intelligence Summit]]'s board of advisers after receiving information that the conference's primary sponsor, Cherney, had "alleged ties to the Russian mafia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/furor-erupts-over-recordings-of-saddam/27684/ |title=Furor Erupts Over Recordings of Saddam |author=Eli Lake |newspaper=The New York Sun |date=16 February 2006 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2007/05/03/Outside-View-Fearing-oligarchs-Part-2/UPI-92881178214623/ |title=Outside View: Fearing oligarchs -- Part 2 |author=Sergei Markov |publisher=UPI |date=3 May 2007 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal investigations==

===Invalid passport===
On 21 May 1994, Cherney and his future wife were detained by immigration officers on arrival in [[Heathrow]] from [[Geneva]]. It was discovered that they had attempted to enter the UK on false [[Poland|Polish]] passports and they were deported back to [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="BAILII_1530"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2008/1530.html |title=Cherney v Deripaska, 2008 EWHC 1530 (Comm), |publisher=[[Free_Access_to_Law_Movement#BAILII|BAILII]] |date=3 July 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day they were arrested by the Swiss police on the grounds that they had made use of false identities. Both were searched and found to be in possession of two allegedly invalid Polish driving licences. Cherney gave a statement to the police in which he admitted using a Polish passport in an attempt to enter the UK, which had been successful previously.&lt;ref name="BAILII_1530" /&gt; On 25 October 1994 the Swiss authorities confirmed that they would not be pressing any charges against Cherney. On 20 November 1996 the Swiss Federal Aliens Office confirmed that he was no longer subject to a prohibition order and that there was nothing to prevent his coming into Switzerland.&lt;ref name="BAILII_1530" /&gt;

===Alleged illegal payments to Avigdor Lieberman===
Cherney is a close friend of [[Avigdor Lieberman]] who allegedly received millions of shekels from various entrepreneurs, including Cherney, while serving as member of [[Knesset]]; under Israeli law, MKs are not allowed to receive any payment beyond their salary. One claim is that Cherney paid a company called ''Path to the East'' large amounts of money between the years 1999 and 2006, and that these sums were then allegedly passed on to Lieberman as a bribe. Other allegations concern a company called ''M.L.1'', founded by Lieberman's daughter Michal when she was 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/who-s-the-boss-1.217557 |title=Who's the boss? |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |author=[[Uri Blau]] |date=7 April 2007 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These allegations concern money transferred to M.L.1 from unknown sources outside Israel; the money was later allegedly used for paying salaries to Avigdor and Michal Lieberman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Uri Blau]] |author2=[[Alex Levac]] |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1249131 |script-title=he:הקופה הקטנה והתסריט שכתב יו"ר ישראל ביתנו אביגדור ליברמן |language=he |trans-title=The Small Fund and the Screenplay Written by Israel Beitenu Leader Avigdor Lieberman |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=6 March 2009 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, Israeli police questioned [[Avigdor Lieberman]], Israel's Deputy Prime Minister, on suspicions of illegally financing his 2001 electoral campaign. According to the police, in May 2001, three months after Lieberman was appointed Minister of Infrastructure in [[Ariel Sharon]]'s Cabinet, approximately $US500,000 was transferred to the bank accounts of Lieberman associates through [[Cyprus]]. This money could be traced back to Cherney. Cherney's attorney, Yaakov Weinroth, said the money was transferred by his client "for a totally transparent, legal wine deal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/500-000-funneled-to-lieberman-associates-1.218910 |title=$500,000 funneled to Lieberman associates |author=Gidi Weitz |author2=[[Uri Blau]] |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, [[Haaretz]] reported that the Israeli Attorney General had issued a draft indictment against [[Avigdor Lieberman]] for fraud and money laundering, including allegations against Cherny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tomer Zarchin |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/ag-plans-to-charge-lieberman-with-fraud-and-money-laundering-1.355836 |title=AG plans to charge Lieberman with fraud and money laundering |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second ''[[Haaretz]]'' article detailing the draft indictment reported that a company owned by Cherney had paid $US500,000 to a company owned by [[Avigdor Lieberman]] in May 2001.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;{{cite news |author=Gidi Weitz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/draft-charges-lieberman-made-millions-in-illegal-business-deals-1.365032 |title=Draft charges: Lieberman made millions in illegal business deals |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=31 May 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It added, "Prosecutors say Lieberman then used his government posts to try to restore Chernoy's Israeli passport, which he had been stripped of in 1999, and to assist him in other personal matters."&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt; Cherney was acquitted. Over the years, Cherney's passport was returned by the Israeli authorities.&lt;ref name="globes2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000654092 |title=After a Long Legal Battle: Mikhail Cherney Received an Israeli Passport |work=Globes |author=Yoaz, Yuval |date=June 14, 2011 |accessdate=May 16, 2016 |language=Hebrew |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605025503/http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000654092 |archivedate=5 June 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bezeq affair===
In 1999, businessman [[Gad Zeevi]] purchased shares in the Israeli telecommunications company [[Bezeq]] on behalf of businesses he owned. According to an indictment filed in 2004, Cherney provided the financial guarantee for the purchase—information that Cherney and Zeevi hid from the banks financing the deal, in fear that Cherney's direct involvement would not be approved by the Israeli ministry of communications. In 2015, Cherney, Zeevi and a number of other defendants were cleared of all charges, with the court stating that the information had not in fact been hidden, and the fact that Cherney loaned the necessary funds to Zeevi did not constitute fraud against Bezeq.&lt;ref name="globes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001075168 |title=Bezeq Affair: Full Acquital for Zeevi, Cherney, Ze'ev Rom and Michael Komissar |work=Globes |author=Ma'anit, Hen |date=October 21, 2015 |accessdate=May 16, 2016 |language=Hebrew |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605012224/http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1001075168 |archivedate=5 June 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish allegations and attempted arrest in the United Kingdom===
According to sources cited in the Spanish daily ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', Spanish authorities sought Cherney in connection to "[[Operation Avispa]]", a 2005 investigation that had resulted in the arrest of several prominent Russian mafia figures. The investigators believe that Cherney managed several Spanish businesses, registered in Alicante and Levante, used by the mafia for money laundering of 4 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?story_id=30622&amp;action_id=2 |title=Cherney Faces Travel Problems |newspaper=[[The St. Petersburg Times]] |agency=[[Vedomosti]] |date=19 January 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/07/05/espana/1246812131.html |title=Reino Unido elude detener a un mafioso ruso reclamado por España |language=es |trans-title=UK elude arresting a Russian mobster claimed by Spain |author=Fernando Lázaro |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |date=6 July 2009 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, [[Supreme Court of Spain|Spain's Supreme Court]] issued a detention order against Cherney. Along with his business partners Oleg Deripaska (head of [[RusAl]]) and [[Iskander Makhmudov]] (head of [[UGMK-HOLDING|UGMK]]), Cherney is suspected of laundering money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/papel/2010/03/21/mercados/23228430.html |title=El pulso de los oligarcas rusos en la Audiencia Nacional |language=es |trans-title=The pulse of Russian oligarchs in the High Court |author=Carlos Segovia |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |date=21 March 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish authorities claim they succeeded in tracing the organization's complicated money laundering track, including Deripaska's, Makhmudov's and Cherney's alleged participation. As a result, [[Interpol]] issued an international arrest warrant against Cherney.&lt;ref name="Interpol"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Olga Viniar |agency=[[Calcalist]] |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3835491,00.html |title=Michael Cherney wanted by Interpol |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=18 January 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/08/09MADRID869.html |title=Viewing cable 09MADRID869, Updates in Spain's Investigations of Russian Mafia |publisher=[[WikiLeaks]] |date=31 August 2009 |accessdate=12 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017104556/http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/08/09MADRID869.html |archivedate=17 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }} U.S. diplomatic cable from U.S. Embassy in Madrid released 7 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit against Oleg Deripaska==
On 24 November 2006, Cherney filed a suit against [[Oleg Deripaska]], a Russian billionaire who owns the huge Russian aluminium company, [[RusAl]], in the Commercial Court of London's High Court. Cherney sought a Court declaration affirming that Deripaska holds 20% of the RusAl shares on behalf of Cherney or damages for breach of Deripaska's agreement to dispose of the shares and to account to Cherney for the proceeds. The claims are based on a written agreement between the two businessmen that was signed in a London hotel room in March 2001. Deripaska denies that Cherney owns shares and said in an affidavit that his relationship with Cherney was one of a businessman being extorted by a crime boss. After the 2001 meeting, Deripaska paid Cherney $US250 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Andrew E. Kramer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/23/business/global/23rusal.html |title=Russian Oligarch's Long Road to a Hong Kong I.P.O. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=22 January 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2006 RusAl was in the final stages of negotiating a takeover of domestic rival SuAl and the aluminium assets of [[Glencore]], a major Swiss commodities trader, which could create a new company valued at up to $US30 billion. According to this estimate, Cherney's 20 percent stake in RusAl could be worth as much as $US3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15980235 MSNBC report on lawsuit against Deripaska] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 July 2008, a British judge ruled that Cherney had the right to sue Deripaska for £2 billion. High Court Justice Christopher Clarke ruled that Cherney might be assassinated or held on trumped-up charges if he tried to bring the case in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Peter Graff |date=3 July 2008 |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUKL0355457020080703 |title=High Court allows Cherney lawsuit against Deripaska to proceed in the UK |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a June 2011 case management conference, the judge deferred a decision on whether Cherney would be allowed to give evidence by video link from Israel rather than appear in person as an outstanding Interpol arrest warrant means he would be detained if he visited the UK.&lt;ref name="Interpol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt; In late July 2011, the High Court ruled that Cherney may give evidence at the trial by video link from Israel and set trial for April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23973334-the-gangster-a-billionaire-friend-of-mandelson-and-a-pound-23bn-row.do |title=The 'gangster', a billionaire friend of Mandelson and a £2.3bn row |work=[[London Evening Standard]] |first=Paul |last=Cheston |date=28 July 2011 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222031121/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23973334-the-gangster-a-billionaire-friend-of-mandelson-and-a-pound-23bn-row.do |archivedate=22 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case was settled out of court between Cherney and Deripaska in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/27/deripaska-cherney-surprise-deal | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Luke | last=Harding | title=Deripaska and Cherney make surprise deal out of court | date=27 September 2012 |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illegal wiretaps===
On 13 January 2010, a [[Tel Aviv]] Court handed down its first verdict in the case of [[Surveillance#Telephones_and_mobile_telephones|illegal eavesdropping]] on Cherney. Aviv Mor, a [[private investigator]] was found guilty of illegally gathering information of personal nature - in particular, tapping the phones of Cherney and sentenced to a [[plea bargain]]ed result which handed down a 14-month sentence to Mor. Part of the sentence will be in the form of [[community service]] and the rest will be a [[suspended sentence]]. The [[District attorney]]'s office stated in court that the cases of other suspects in the illegal data collection case "are at an advanced stage and close to [[indictment]] ." In February 2008 Cheney  filed a suit in a Tel Aviv court that alleged the illegal spying was commissioned by a Russian citizen, Alexei Drobashenko who at the time was the head of the External Relations department at Basic Element, a financial and industrial group that belongs to [[Oleg Deripaska]]. Cherney claimed that it was this [[Russian oligarch]], acting through Drobashenko, who had hired Eskin, Pridan and Mor. In his claim, Cherney accused a group of 10 plotters, including Oleg Deripaska, Alexei Drobashenko and the already sentenced Aviv Mor, of illegal wiretapping, hacking the computers of his charity fund, publishing slanderous articles, and harassing him with insulting graffities and leaflets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ca.sys-con.com/node/1256803 |title=Detective Hired by Deripaska's Employee to Wiretap Cherney Sentenced in Tel-Aviv |publisher=Ajaz world magazine |agency=PR Newswire |date=22 January 2010 |accessdate=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Spouse of Michael Cherney is a businesswoman [[Nicole Raidman]]. In 2010 their first daughter was born [[Michelle Raidman]]. and in 2014 their son Richie. Cherney and Raidman live in Herzliya Israel.

'''Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation''' is a Japanese [[pharmaceuticals]] company, a subsidiary of [[Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation]]. {{nihongo|'''Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation'''|三菱ウェルファーマ株式会社|Mitsubishi Werufāma Kabushiki-gaisha}} was formed in 2001 from the merger of [[Mitsubishi-Tokyo Pharmaceuticals]] and [[Welfide Corporation]].  On October 1, 2007 [[Tanabe Seiyaku Co., Ltd.]] merged with Mitsubishi Pharma to form Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mt-pharma.co.jp/shared/show.php?url=../e/company/history.html Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporate History]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mitsubishi Tanaba Pharma is a member of the [[Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group]] (MUFJ) [[keiretsu]].

==History==
Takeda Kasei Co., Ltd. was established in 1940 by Chobei Takeda &amp; Co., Ltd. (present-day [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company]]) and Nippon Kasei Chemical Co. Ltd. (present-day [[Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation]]) and built its first plant in [[Higashi-Yoshitomi-mura]], [[Fukuoka Prefecture]]. The company changed its name in 1952 to Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. in 1946 and listed on Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges in 1949.

The Blood Plasma Corporation of Japan was established in 1950 with head office and plant in [[Osaka]]. This company changed its name to [[Green Cross (Japan)|Green Cross Corporation]] in 1964.

Green Cross Corporation was acquired by Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical in 1998, changing its name to Welfide Corporation in 2000.
The founders of Green Cross Corporation included war criminals such as [[Masaji Kitano|Kitano Masaji]] who performed torture and experimentations on humans in the Japanese military's notorious [[Unit 731]] during World War II.  These crimes were recognized by the UN as extreme "crimes against humanity".

In 1901 [[Motosaburo Tanabe]] established a [[pharmacy]] in [[Tokyo]], which was incorporated in 1921 as Motosaburo Tanabe Shoten, changing its name in 1943 to Tokyo Tanabe Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.

Nippon Tar Industries was established in 1921, becoming Mitsubishi Chemical Industries, Ltd. in 1952. This company established a business alliance with Tokyo Tanabe Pharmaceuticals Co. in 1981, and changed its name to [[Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation]] following the 1984 merger with Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co., Ltd.

Mitsubishi-Tanabe Pharmaceuticals developed the first [[BET inhibitor]] molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=JP |number=2008156311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=JP |number=H0228181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation and Tokyo Tanabe Pharmaceuticals Co. merged formally in 1999 and formed Mitsubishi-Tokyo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to take over the combined pharmaceutical operations of the two companies.

Mitsubishi-Tokyo Pharmaceuticals and Welfide Corporation merged in 2001 to establish Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation, and this company joined again with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation to create [[Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation]] in October 2005.

In August 2014 the company announced it had agreed to collaborate with [[AstraZeneca]] to leverage the pair's strengths, expertise and assets on [[diabetic nephropathy]], in a bid to  develop high quality drugs much quicker than working alone. According to the [[National Institute of Health]], 60% to 70% of diabetic sufferers in the U.S. alone suffered from nerve disorders related to diabetic nephropathy. The three-year research agreement has the objective of creating new treatments to replace expensive and limited options currently in place, mainly being dialysis or kidney transplantation.&lt;ref name="AstraZenecaMTPC"&gt;{{cite news|title=AstraZeneca and MTPC come together for research on diabetic nephropathy drugs|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/astrazeneca-mtpc-partner-to-validate-diabetic-nephropathy-targets/81250258/?kwrd=Medicines%20Company|date=20 August 2014|accessdate=21 August 2014|publisher=''Genetic Engineering News''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, 2017, the company acquired [[Neuroderm]] for $1.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-neuroderm-m-a-mitsub-tanabe-idUKKBN1A90IA&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mitte''' is the first and most central [[boroughs and localities of Berlin|borough]] of [[Berlin]]. The borough consists of six sub-entities: [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte proper]], [[Gesundbrunnen (Berlin)|Gesundbrunnen]], [[Hansaviertel]], [[Moabit]], [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Tiergarten]] and [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]].

It is one of the two boroughs (beside [[Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg]]) which comprises former [[West Berlin|West]] and [[East Berlin]] districts. Mitte encompasses Berlin's historic core and includes some of the most important tourist sites of Berlin like [[Museum Island]], the [[Fernsehturm Berlin|TV tower]], [[Checkpoint Charlie]], [[Brandenburg Gate]], [[Unter den Linden]], [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[Alexanderplatz]], the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] and [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]], most of which were in former East Berlin.

When Berliners refer to ''Mitte'' they usually mean the smaller locality rather than the larger borough.

==Geography==
[[File:Berliner Dom und Fernsehturm, 170117, ako.jpg|left|thumb|[[Berlin Cathedral]] and [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Television Tower]]]]
Mitte ([[German language|German]] for "middle", "centre") is located in the central part of Berlin along the [[Spree]] River. It borders on [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]] in the west, [[Reinickendorf]] in the north, [[Pankow]] in the east, [[Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg]] in the southeast, and [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]] in the southwest.

In the middle of the Spree lies Museum Island (''Museumsinsel'') with its museums and [[Berlin Cathedral]] (''Berliner Dom''). The central square in Mitte is [[Alexanderplatz]] with the prominent [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower), Germany's highest building, and the large railway station with connections to many subway ([[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]), tramway ([[Berlin tram|Straßenbahn]]), city trains ([[S-Bahn Berlin|S-Bahn]]) and buses.

There are some important streets which connect Mitte with the other boroughs, e.g. the boulevard Unter den Linden which connects Alexanderplatz to the west with Brandenburg Gate and runs further as [[Straße des 17. Juni]] to the [[Berlin Victory Column|Victory Column]] and the centre of former West Berlin in [[Charlottenburg]], or [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] from [[Alexanderplatz]] to [[Friedrichshain]] and the eastern suburbs.

==History==
[[File:Berlin - Checkpoint Charlie 1963.jpg|thumb|[[Checkpoint Charlie]],1963]]
The former Mitte district had been established by the 1920 [[Greater Berlin Act]] and comprised large parts of the historic city around [[Alt-Berlin]] and [[Cölln]]. Brandenburg Gate was the western exit at the Berlin city boundary until 1861.

Between 1961 and 1990, Mitte was the central part of East Berlin, however at the same time it was surrounded by the [[Berlin Wall]] at its north, south and west. There were some border control points, the most famous of which was [[Checkpoint Charlie]] between [[Kreuzberg]] and Mitte, which was operated by the [[United States Army]] and its allies and was open to foreigners and diplomats.

Two other checkpoints were at Heinrich-Heine-Straße/[[Prinzenstraße (Berlin U-Bahn)|Prinzenstraße]] east of Checkpoint Charlie, open to citizens of West Germany and West Berlin and on [[Invalidenstraße]] in the north on the border with the West Berlin Tiergarten district (the present-day [[Moabit]] locality).

== Regierungsviertel (Government District) ==
The government district is located in the locality of [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Tiergarten]] around the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag Building.]] Most institutions of the German government have their seat at the Regierungsviertel 
* [[Bundestag]], the German parliament in the old [[Reichstag building|Reichstag Building]]
* [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]], seat of the [[President of Germany|Federal President]] 
* [[German Chancellery]]
* Offices of the [[Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin|Abgeordneten]], members of the parliament, in the ''Paul-Löbe-Haus'' and the ''Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus''
* [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]]

== Tiergarten Park ==
[[Tiergarten (park)|Großer Tiergarten]] is the name of the biggest urban park in Mitte, located in the [[Tiergarten, Berlin|same-named locality]]. The Tiergarten Park was established as a hunting ground in the 16th century by the Prussian kings. Today its enclosed by densely built-up areas by [[Hansaviertel]] and [[Moabit]] in the north, the Government District in the east and the [[City West]] and the Embassy Quarter in the southwest.

Many cultural monuments and memorials are located in the Tiergarten Park, like the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegessäule]], the [[Soviet War Memorial (Tiergarten)|Soviet War Memorial]] and a historic rose garden. The [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]], the biggest victim group of the Nazi-Diktatorship, is located on the east side of the park, near the [[Brandenburg Gate]] and the place where once [[Reich Chancellery|Hitler's New Reich Chancellery]] was.

== Kulturforum ==
[[File:Philharmonie 1a.jpg|thumb|[[Berliner Philharmonie|Philharmonie Berlin]]]]
The Kulturforum was built in the 1950s and 1960s at the edge of [[West Berlin]], after most of the once unified city's cultural assets had been lost behind the [[Berlin Wall]]. The Kulturforum is characterized by its innovative modernist architecture; several buildings are distinguished by the organic designs of [[Hans Scharoun]], and the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] was designed by [[Mies van der Rohe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3398">The '''National Smoker's Alliance''' (NSA) was formed in 1993 to protest against U.S. [[Smoking bans|anti-smoking legislation]].
The NSA was a public relations group created and funded by the tobacco industry, which operated nationally from 1994 to 1999 to advocate for adults using tobacco products without vigorous regulation or increased tobacco taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Givel | first = Michael | title = Consent and counter-mobilization: the case of the national smokers alliance. | journal = Journal of Health Communication | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 339–57 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | location = London | date = Jun 2007 | pmid = 17558787 | issn = 1081-0730 | doi=10.1080/10810730701326002}}&lt;/ref&gt;   An early example of [[astroturfing]], the NSA employed [[stealth marketing]] tactics to give the appearance of [[grassroots]] opposition to anti-smoking laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Beder| first = Sharon | title = Public Relations' Role in Manufacturing Artificial Grass Roots Coalitions | journal = Public Relations Quarterly | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 21–3 | publisher = Public Relations Quarterly | date = Summer 1998 | url = http://www.uow.edu.au/~sharonb/PR.html | accessdate = 23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Freeman | first = Becky | last2 = Chapman | first2 = Simon | title = Is "YouTube" telling or selling you something?

One of the NSA's members included famed talk show host [[Morton Downey, Jr.]];&lt;ref name="McCusker2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerry McCusker|title=Talespin: public relations disasters-inside stories &amp; lessons learnt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3_sqlzml3fcC&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=23 April 2011|year=2005|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|isbn=978-0-7494-4259-0|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he gave up smoking after being diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] in 1996 (and in doing so reversed his smoking stance to an anti-smoking one); he died of the disease in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Talk-Show Pioneer Morton Downey Jr. Dies | publisher = ABC News | date = 13 March 2001 | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=108365&amp;page=1 | accessdate = 23 April 2011 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 tobacco company [[Altria|Philip Morris]] announced that it would withdraw funding after the NSA made an ethics complaint about [[John McCain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55018233.html Philip Morris U.S.A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1233">In [[law]], the '''ordinary course of business''' covers the usual transactions, customs and practices of a certain business and of a certain firm. This term is used particularly to judge the validity of certain transactions.  It is used in several different sections of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] of the United States.

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/article1.htm#s1-201 Section 1-201 of the Uniform Commercial Code] defines a "Buyer in the ordinary course of business" by a four-part test:

# a person that buys goods in [[good faith]],
# without knowledge that the sale violates the rights of another person in the goods &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;e.g. a [[security interest]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
# and in the ordinary course from a person, other than a [[pawnbroker]], '''in the business of selling goods of that kind'''.
# A person buys goods in the ordinary course if the sale to the person '''comports with the usual or customary practices''' in the kind of business in which the seller is engaged or with the seller's own usual or customary practices.

:&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;emphasis added&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Abdull Ghafar Khan''' (born 21 July 1962), better known as '''Phillip Khan''', is a Hong Kong businessman and political activist. A [[Pakistanis in Hong Kong|Pakistani national born and raised in Hong Kong]], Khan's ambitions to stand for election to [[Legislative Council (Hong Kong)|the city's Legislative Council]] reportedly have been blocked by the refusal of the [[Hong Kong Immigration Department]] to consider his application for [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China#Hong Kong|naturalisation as a Chinese national]].&lt;ref name="MingPao20120814"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sina.com.hk/news/3/1/1/2744005/1.html|title=香港仔巴漢申特區護照被拒 (Aberdeen Pakistani man's application for SAR passport refused)|work=[[Ming Pao]]|date=14 August 2012|accessdate=14 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130107210240/http://news.sina.com.hk/news/3/1/1/2744005/1.html|archivedate=7 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Khan concurrently holds [[Pakistani nationality law|Pakistani nationality]] and [[British National (Overseas)]] status. His father came to Hong Kong in 1915, when the city was still [[British Hong Kong|ruled by the British Empire]].&lt;ref name="MingPao20120814"/&gt; His uncle served in the [[Hong Kong Police Force]], and was killed in a bombing in 1944 during [[World War II]]. After the war, his father settled in [[Diamond Hill]], where he ran a dairy farm. Khan himself was born in Hong Kong in 1962 and studied at the former Mansfield College in [[Knutsford Terrace]], [[Tsim Sha Tsui]]; he was the only member of his class not of Chinese ethnicity, and thus became fluent in [[Cantonese]]. He graduated in 1976.&lt;ref name="RTHK20121015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://programme.rthk.org.hk/rthk/tv/programme.php?name=tv/hkcc&amp;p=858&amp;d=2012-10-15&amp;e=193706&amp;m=episode|author=李君萍 (Lee Kwan-ping)|title=身份不明 (Unclear Identities)|work=[[Radio Television Hong Kong]]|date=15 October 2012|accessdate=20 April 2013|post=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, when the [[Waves of mass migrations from Hong Kong#1980s and 1990s|wave of emigration from Hong Kong]] was reaching its peak, Khan made the decision to remain in Hong Kong, stating that he saw it as his home.&lt;ref name="MingPao20120814"/&gt; He runs a trading company, due to which he travels frequently to [[Shenzhen]] for business and speaks [[Mandarin Chinese]] as well.&lt;ref name="RTHK20121015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1013818/businessman-philip-khan-born-hong-kong-cannot-get-passport|first=Simpson|last=Cheung|title=Businessman Phillip Khan born in Hong Kong cannot get passport|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=14 August 2012|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asianewsnet.net/news-38732.html|last=Li|first=Xueying|title=Minorities facing challenges in HK|work=[[The Straits Times]]|date=12 November 2012|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 Minibond protests==
Khan suffered financial losses in the September 2008 [[bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers]] due to his investments in so-called "[[Minibond]]s" – structured financial products similar to [[equity-linked note]]s which were marketed to many members of the Hong Kong public with claims of being a safe and low-risk product. In the aftermath, he became involved in efforts to gain compensation for affected noteholders. In November 2008, Khan organised a protest march from [[Sogo]] Department Store in [[Causeway Bay]] to the [[Central Government Offices]] in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]]; attendees shouted slogans calling for then-Chief Executive of Hong Kong [[Donald Tsang]] to step down and criticising the opacity of the banks' operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://life.mingpao.com/cfm/dailynews3b.cfm?File=20091102/nalgd/gda1.txt|title=網民圍禮賓府被阻截 不滿政府漠視基層 喊特首下台 (Internet users blocked from surrounding Government House; dissatisfied with government's neglect of grassroots, call for Chief Executive to step down)|work=[[Ming Pao]]|date=2 November 2009|accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, when former US president [[Bill Clinton]] visited Hong Kong for the first annual meeting of the [[Clinton Foundation]], Khan organised protests outside of the [[Grand Hyatt Hong Kong]] where Clinton was staying, in an attempt to draw attention to the issue. Roughly 90 people attended the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sina.com.hk/cgi-bin/nw/show.cgi/2/1/1/961103/1.html|title=90苦主向克林頓請願不果 (Ninety debtholders fruitlessly petition Clinton)|work=Oriental Daily News|date=4 December 2008|accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan continued leading protest activities throughout 2009 and 2010. In January 2009, Khan and four fellow protestors collected signatures from over two thousand affected noteholders and set off for neighbouring [[Macau]] to submit a petition to then-[[Vice-President of the People's Republic of China]] [[Xi Jinping]], who was visiting the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/expressnews/20090110/news_20090110_55_551406.htm|title=5名雷曼苦主準備乘船往澳門向習近平表達不滿 (Five Lehman debtholders prepare to board a boat to Macau to express their dissatisfaction to Xi Jinping)|work=[[Radio Television Hong Kong]]|date=10 January 2009|accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, after [[Standard Chartered]] admitted that they had made errors in estimating the risk associated with Minibonds, Khan led a protest outside of the [[Old Supreme Court Building, Hong Kong|Legislative Council Building]], during which he stood in the middle of the street in an attempt to block a Standard Chartered company bus from departing the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.hk.msn.com/local/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3895023|title=渣打高層認錯估雷曼倒閉風險 (Standard Chartered executives admit error in estimating Lehman's risk of collapse)|work=Oriental Daily News|date=8 May 2010|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan has twice attempted to submit applications to the [[Hong Kong Immigration Department]] for naturalisation as a Chinese national; however, each time, the immigration officer on duty refused to accept his papers, stating that he did not have a close relative who was a Chinese national.&lt;ref name="AppleDaily20121213"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20121213/18099692|title=植根港百年 巴漢被拒入籍 入境處原因：沒有近親是中國人 (Rooted in Hong Kong for a hundred years, Pakistani man's naturalisation refused; Immigration Department reason: does not have close Chinese relative)|work=[[Apple Daily]]|date=13 December 2012|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an Immigration Department spokesperson, applications will be taken from all persons submitting them, but under the {{HKOrd|name=Chinese Nationality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance|540|5}}, the Department is not required to inform the applicant of the reason for rejection.&lt;ref name="MingPao20120814"/&gt; His inability to naturalise has also meant he cannot obtain a [[Home Return Permit]] for travel to mainland China; instead, he has to use his passport, waiting in line at immigration control at [[Luohu Port]] for more than half an hour each time and quickly running out of pages for [[passport stamp]]s, requiring him to pay additional fees to add pages to his passport or renew it.&lt;ref name="RTHK20121015"/&gt;

News of Khan's troubles prompted [[Equal Opportunities Commission (Hong Kong)|Equal Opportunities Commission]] Chairman [[Lam Woon-kwong]] to write a letter of concern to the Immigration Department.&lt;ref name="MingPao20120814"/&gt; In December 2012, Khan organised public protests over the issue, marching and holding signs at the [[Central Government Complex, Tamar|Central Government Complex in Tamar]] with roughly twenty other South Asians whose applications for naturalisation had similarly been rejected.&lt;ref name="AppleDaily20121213"/&gt;

==Other activities==
In the early 2000s, Khan participated in a number of Hong Kong political activities, including the [[Hong Kong 1 July marches]] against [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Basic Law Article 23]] security legislation, as well as candlelight vigils in [[Victoria Park, Hong Kong|Victoria Park]] in memory of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].&lt;ref name="MingPao20120814"/&gt; He has also spoken out against the Hong Kong [[Education Bureau]]'s refusal to develop a local Chinese-as-a-second-language curriculum for students from non-Chinese-speaking households.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.now.com/home/local/player?newsId=62775|title=南亞裔港人：不懂中文等如「殘廢」 (Hong Kong South Asian man: not understanding Chinese like being "handicapped")|work=Now News|date=19 March 2013|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States Navy]], '''Refueling and Overhaul (ROH)''' refers to a lengthy process or procedure performed on [[nuclear-power]]ed naval [[ship]]s, which involves replacement of expended [[nuclear fuel]] with new fuel and a general maintenance fix-up, renovation, and often modernization of the entire ship.  In theory, such a process could simply involve only refueling or only an overhaul, but nuclear refueling is usually combined with an overhaul.  An ROH usually takes one to two years for submarines and up to almost three years for an aircraft carrier, performed at a naval [[shipyard]].  Time periods between ROHs on a ship have varied historically from about 5–20 years (for [[submarine]]s) to up to 25 years (for {{Sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|2}}s).  For modern submarines and aircraft carriers, ROHs are typically carried out about midway through their operating lifespan.  There are also shorter maintenance fix-ups called ''availabilities'' for ships periodically at shipyards.  A particularly lengthy refueling, maintenance, and modernization process for a nuclear [[aircraft carrier]] can last up to almost three years and be referred to as a '''Refueling Complex Overhaul (RCOH)'''.

==Process==
At a shipyard, a ship to undergo ROH goes into a [[drydock]], which is then closed off from the sea.  Water is evacuated from the drydock with keel blocks pre positioned under the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]], so the ship's keel area will rest on the blocks as the water is pumped out.  At the end of the ROH, the drydock is refilled with water so the ship can be re-floated and removed from the dock.

To start ROH, operating procedures are used to shut down and cool down the propulsion [[power plant]] to bring it to desired temperatures, pressures, and other conditions.  During the ROH, ship's Navy crew stand shutdown watches, and civilian shipyard workers do much of the repair, maintenance, and installation work.  During an ROH, all personnel in a maintenance work area are commonly required to wear a [[hard hat]].

Land-based [[naval reactor]] prototype plants have also undergone similar refueling and overhauls, not at a shipyard but at whatever facility they are located.

===Refueling===
In a nuclear-powered ship, the nuclear fuel is essentially a solid inside a reactor core which is inside the ship's [[nuclear reactor]].  Once a reactor core has gone critical, meaning it has been used during a reactor operation, highly [[radioactive]] [[nuclear fission products]] have formed in the core, and the core has become highly radioactive.  Refueling involves taking the expended core out of the reactor and putting in a new core with fresh nuclear fuel.  Because it is so radioactive, removing a core with spent nuclear fuel from a reactor requires elaborate radiological handling precautions.  All materials that came in contact with the critical core, including the internal surfaces and [[Nuclear reactor coolant|coolant water]], are considered  [[Radioactive contamination|radioactively contaminated]] and require special radiological handling and disposal precautions.  In addition to radiological training and qualification required for working in radiation areas or with radioactive materials or contamination, [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]] to workers is monitored to ensure maximum exposure limits are not exceeded.

===Overhaul===
The overhaul commonly includes extensive maintenance and renovation work and checks of various systems and equipment aboard the [[ship]].  A&amp;nbsp;major overhaul also typically includes upgrading various systems and equipment to modernize them; for example, old [[Analog electronics|analog electrical]] equipment may be replaced by new [[Digital electronics|digital electronic]] equipment.  The work for such overhauls is typically planned out by [[engineer]]s well in advance and new equipment is obtained for any replacements or installations.

An example of renovation work done during refueling and overhauls of submarines is the conversion of a [[fleet ballistic missile submarine]] (SSBN) to a [[guided missile submarine]] (SSGN).  Such a conversion consists of taking the 24 [[ballistic missile]]s and their silos out of the missile section in the submarine, and replacing them with 154 [[Tomahawk cruise missile]]s and special operations force insertion platforms which can carry up to 66 special operations personnel.  The first four {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|2}}s have undergone such conversions during their midlife refueling and overhauls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cst/csat27.pdf Unmanned Undersea Vehicles And Guided Missile Submarines: Technological and Operational Synergies]&lt;/ref&gt;  For more details, see {{section link|Ohio-class submarine|SSBN/SSGN conversions}}.
[[File:OHIOSSGNCONVERSION.JPG|thumb|center|540px|{{USS|Ohio|SSGN-726|6}} in drydock undergoing conversion to SSGN]]
During an overhaul, an extensive testing program is conducted.  Numerous test procedures that have been written are followed, data is recorded as required, and logs of the testing are kept.  Tests that can be conducted include: [[Industrial radiography|radiography]] to test critical [[Welding|welds]], testing of fluid systems and other pressure boundaries which includes [[hydrostatic test]]ing to detect any [[leak]]s, and testing of electrical and mechanical setpoints for various types of equipment such as sensor input setpoints for various kinds of automatic trips and [[safety valve]] relief pressure setpoints.  At the finish of the ROH, the testing data records are bound and retained as a permanent documentation record resulting from the ROH.

As the ship is readied, toward the end of the ROH, the power plant is warmed or brought back up to the desired [[operating temperature]] and pressure so it can be  started when ready.

==Refueling and Complex Overhaul==
'''Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH)''' is a process for refueling and upgrading [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|nuclear-powered aircraft carrier]]s in the [[United States Navy|US Navy]]. The [[nuclear reactors]] that power some aircraft carriers typically use up their [[nuclear fuel]] about halfway through their desired 50-year life spans. Because carriers can last so long before being retired, they are refueled and refurbished with an RCOH to extend their usable lifetime. At the same time a ship is refueled, it is given a complex overhaul in which broken, worn or obsolete parts are repaired or replaced and systems are modernized. The modernization typically includes an upgrade of ship’s [[combat systems]] and warfighting capabilities, its internal distribution systems are upgraded, and allowance is made for future upgrades over the ship’s remaining operational service life.  Given the size of an aircraft carrier and the number of systems and subsystems it has, an RCOH is extremely complex, costly (several billion dollars), and time-consuming. Each RCOH is planned to take 46 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/cvn-68-mods.htm CVN-68 Nimitz-class Modernization]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/uss-theodore-roosevelt-headed-into-midlife-overhaul-02810/ USS Theodore Roosevelt Headed Into Mid-Life Overhaul]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nn.northropgrumman.com/capabilities/rco.html Refueling and Complex Overhaul]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saul Solomon - Cape Politician and Liberal Activist - Cape Archives.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Saul Solomon, at his seat in the Cape House of Assembly]]'''Saul Solomon''' (25 May 1817 – 16 October 1892) was an influential liberal politician of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]]. A tireless defender of racial and religious equality, Saul Solomon was an important member of the movement for [[responsible government]] and an opponent of [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]]'s disastrous [[Confederation]] scheme.

==Early life and background==
Saul Solomon was born on the island of [[St Helena]] on 25 May 1817 (the nephew of the great St Helena businessman Saul Solomon senior). Although his family were St Helenan, they had close links to Cape Town. Saul spent his first few years at a Jewish children's home in England, where he suffered from the malnutrition and rickets that physically affected him for the rest of his life. He then had a rudimentary formal education in South Africa before beginning work as an apprentice in a printing business. He later acquired the business and built it into the largest printing business in the country, founding the ''[[Cape Argus]]'' newspaper. He was also one of the founders of [[Old Mutual]], today one of the largest insurance firms in South Africa.&lt;ref name="wikispaces1"&gt;[http://1820gw.wikispaces.com/2.3++Saul+Solomon+Family ''1820gw – 2.3 Saul Solomon Family'', accessdate=2012-12-06]&lt;/ref&gt;

As representative for Cape Town, Solomon entered the very first [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope]] (Cape Parliament) when it opened in 1854. He remained an MP for this constituency until his retirement in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hearl|first=Trevor W.|title=In Search of Saul Solomon of St Helena 1776–1852 |url=http://www.archeion.talktalk.net/sthelena/saulsolomon.htm|publisher=The St Helena Institute|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career (1854–1883)==
Saul Solomon's original election promise had been "to give my decided opposition to all legislation tending to introduce distinctions either of class, colour or creed".&lt;ref name=obiog&gt;Stanley Trapido, ‘Solomon, Saul (1817–1892)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51112, accessed 17 Nov 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;
Throughout his political career he strictly adhered to this manifesto – repeatedly turning down both cabinet and ministerial posts so as to be free to vote according to his beliefs.
He thus assumed a unique role in parliament, being a watchdog critic, as well as sometimes the power behind the government, depending on its policies.

Although he was from a [[Jewish]] background and even funded the establishment of the Cape's first synagogue in 1849, Solomon was openly secular in outlook, declaring himself to be "a liberal in politics and a voluntary in religion". In the first Cape parliament in 1854, he presented his "Voluntary bill" (intended to end government subsidies to churches, and to ensure equal treatment of all beliefs) but it was turned down. He proceeded to put it to parliament every year, only for it to be repeatedly rejected, until it was finally passed under the [[John Charles Molteno|Molteno]] government in 1875.

===The Responsible Government Movement (1854–1872)===

The pets shown are Zulu King [[Cetshwayo kaMpande|Cetshwayo]], the Beaufort lion [[John Molteno]] (Cape Prime Minister), and [[John X Merriman]] (shown as a monkey).]]
Solomon joined the movement for [[responsible government]] in the Cape and helped to institute it when it was established in 1872. The leader of the responsible government movement, Prime Minister [[John Charles Molteno]], was an old friend and a great admirer of Saul Solomon's politics. The two men were both businessmen from poor immigrant backgrounds, who had outlooks that were relatively liberal for the times, and saw eye-to-eye on a number of issues. In fact, according to Saul Solomon's official biography, Molteno only accepted the office of Prime Minister after insisting that it first be offered to Solomon, who turned it down however due to his delicate health.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, W. E. C: ''Saul Solomon – the Member for Cape Town''. Cape Town: Oxford University Press, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[R.W. Murray]]: ''South African Reminiscences''. Cape Town:JC Juta &amp; Co. 1894. p.79&lt;/ref&gt;
Solomon went on to give his powerful support to the Molteno Ministry on many occasions in the future, though he characteristically refused all offers of cabinet positions so as to be able to oppose the government if and when his conscience required it.&lt;ref group="note2"&gt;Mr Thompson, MLA for Grahamstown, summed up the situation that "...Molteno would not hold a Ministry together for one week if Mr Solomon was in it; and no cabinet could do without him (Solomon)." ''The Zingari''. 9 June 1871, p.94. Reporting on parliamentary session on 7 June 1871.

The Reader's Digest Association South Africa (Pty) Ltd, 1992. {{ISBN|0-947008-90-X}}. p.129, ''"The Story of Saul Solomon"''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Cape Separatist League (1854–1874)===
{{main|Eastern Cape Separatist League}}
The [[Eastern Cape|eastern part]] of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] had a long-running separatist movement, consisting of a portion of white settlers (the "Easterners"), led by parliamentarian [[John Paterson (Cape politician)|John Paterson]] of [[Port Elizabeth]], who resented the rule of the Cape Town parliament and wanted stricter labour laws to encourage the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] to leave their lands and work on the settlers’ plantations.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmot, A. ''The History of our own Times in South Africa, Volume 1''. J.C. Juta &amp; co., 1899. p.142 &amp; p.227&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with his stated policy that "natives should be allowed to sell their labour as they desired, and that no semblance of coercion should be employed to provide labour for the farmer" and because he detested the Easterners' white supremacist views, Solomon took a strong stance against the separatist movement and for a united, multi-racial Cape.

Famously, when he was addressing parliament about the need to enforce the principles of racial equality that the Cape's constitution called for, the Separatist representatives all stood up and walked out on him. After a second's pause, he reportedly declared: "I would rather address empty benches than empty minds!"&lt;ref name="wikispaces1"/&gt;

In parliament he went on to lead the "Westerners", who backed the [[John Charles Molteno|Molteno–Merriman government]] in successfully crushing the separatist league. Separatist parliamentarians branded him a "negrophile" – an intended insult that he in fact accepted with considerable pride, and he went on to push even further for social reform (for example repealing the discriminatory Contagious Diseases act{{clarify|date=January 2014}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofsouthaf02theauoft/historyofsouthaf02theauoft_djvu.txt |title=History of South Africa, from 1873 to 1884|last1=Theal |first1=George McCall |publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin, Ltd, London|date=1919|accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The imposition of Confederation (1874–1878)===
Starting in 1874, the British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]], having federated Canada, began an ill-fated plan to impose the same system of [[confederation]] on the very different states of southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;''Illustrated History of South Africa'' p.182 "Confederation from the Barrel of a Gun" (1992) The Reader's Digest Association South Africa (Pty) Ltd,  {{ISBN|0-947008-90-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Cape Colony - 1878.jpg|thumb|The Cape Colony in 1878, on the eve of the Confederation wars]]

Although earlier in his career Solomon had been in favour of a form of federated "United States of Southern Africa", he shared with the Cape government concerns about the form and timing of Carnarvon's confederation project. Of particular concern to many liberal politicians were the repressive "native policies" of [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] and the [[Boer republics]] (which would have affected the rights of many Cape citizens). Saul Solomon joined the Cape government in arguing that the Cape's multi-racial constitution might not survive a session of bargaining with the Boer republics. 
Another issue was the fact that some neighbouring states, such as [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] and the [[Transvaal Republic]], would actually require military invasion to be incorporated into the confederation. Consequently, Solomon ended up vigorously opposing Carnarvon's proposal and the "new and impatient imperialism" which motivated it.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan, Mona (1969). ''Sir Henry Barkly, mediator and moderator, 1815–1898''. Balkema: Cape Town. p.259.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative, Solomon proposed a looser system of federation, whereby the Cape could preserve its multi-racial franchise. Another proposed alternative was the "Molteno Plan" of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Government]], which advocated complete union instead of confederation, but with the Cape's constitution (including the multi-racial franchise) extended and imposed on the other states of southern Africa.
Both suggestions were ignored by the British Colonial Office and over the next few years Carnarvon's disastrous confederation scheme unravelled as predicted, leaving a swath of destructive wars across southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;P. A. Molteno (1900) ''The life and times of Sir John Charles Molteno, K. C. M. G., First Premier of Cape Colony, Comprising a History of Representative Institutions and Responsible Government at the Cape'', Smith, Elder &amp; Co., London&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sprigg Government (1878–1881)===
To further the Confederation scheme, the British Governor had appointed a new and more compliant government, under the puppet Prime Minister [[Gordon Sprigg]]. Against the backdrop of the wider "Confederation wars" that now swept southern Africa, Sprigg began to institute a more discriminatory policy towards the Cape's Black African citizens, and this led to revolts and further conflicts like the [[Basuto Gun War]].

Although Saul Solomon had initially agreed to accept Sprigg's new government, its discriminatory policies immediately brought down his strongest criticism, which was voiced through his various media outlets. This culminated in his public campaign against the government for its role in the [[Koegas atrocities]].

Sprigg's retaliation was swift. He ordered a review and cancellation of all government contracts with the Argus and other businesses that were linked to Saul Solomon. These were all given to political allies (though without the equipment to fulfill them and at several times the price). Meanwhile, Sprigg's Attorney-General, Upington, launched a series of high-profile lawsuits (bordering on [[show trial]]s) against Solomon himself.

====The "Pro Bono Publico" trial (1878–79)====
Solomon's editor, the brilliant but contrarian [[Patrick McLoughlin (editor)|Patrick McLoughlin]], had supposedly anonymously written several pieces criticising the Sprigg government and the British colonial establishment, the most imfamous of which was entitled "Pro Bono Publico" ("For the Public Good"). A series of libel lawsuits were launched by the Sprigg government, ultimately targeting Solomon, whom it tried to link the pamphlets too.

Although it was never proven that McLoughlin even authored the pamphlets in question (and Solomon believed he had not), the trial and related pressures caused McLoughlin to resign (he shot himself a few years later). The Sprigg party failed however, to bring Solomon himself down.

====The "Fiat Justitia" trial (1879–80)====
The following year, Solomon's enemies had another opportunity. The Argus printed reports of racism and miscarriage of justice regarding the earlier trials for the [[Koegas atrocities|Koegas murders]], which had been sent to it signed "Fiat Justitia" ("May there be justice").

This generated another round of political trials. These attacked Solomon's new editor, [[Francis Dormer]], for libel but again sought ultimately to damage Solomon himself. 
Once again the editor fell, and once again Solomon survived, in spite of losing the trial. Crucially, he produced letters from the Koegas trial judge asking him to publish the information, and detailing the brutal violence of the murders and the racism which had prevented justice being done.

"Fiat Justitia" ultimately turned out to have been Mr D.P. Faure, who had served as the Koegas court interpreter. Faure was driven from his official career by the Sprigg government, but Solomon later sought out the unemployed Faure and gave him a token translator job with the Argus.

====Aftermath====
Solomon emerged from these attacks financially damaged, but largely victorious. The government, frantically cutting back on core infrastructure to avoid bankruptcy from its war expenses, became increasingly unpopular. When its British backers were recalled to London to face charges of misconduct, the Sprigg government fell.&lt;ref&gt;P.R. Coates: ''Cape Colonial Parliamentary Publications, 1854–1910, with special reference to documents in the Dutch language''. UNISA. 2009. p.&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal details and later life==
[[File:Clarensville House Seapoint - Cape Town.png|thumb|right|Clarensville House in Sea Point]]
Physically, Solomon was partially disabled. Childhood poverty and ill health, aggravated by a bout of [[rickets]], had left him with badly stunted legs. When standing, this made him so short that he needed to stand on a chair to be seen when addressing Parliament. 
His physical condition was particularly drawn attention to by his very high-pitched voice, as well as by the frequent presence by his side of his friend and political ally Molteno, who was unusually tall,&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, D. W. (1971) ''Dictionary of South African Biography'' p.485, Tafelberg Ltd. {{ISBN|0-624-00369-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the image of the two men together was a topic for caricature by the political cartoonists of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Van Heyningen, N &amp; Worden, E &amp; Bickford-Smith, V. (1998) ''Cape Town, the Making of a City'' p.213, Uitgeverij Verloren {{ISBN|90-6550-161-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saul Solomon was nonetheless a famously eloquent and persuasive speaker, with an incredibly sharp mind and a skill for reasoned argument. His proposals were usually painstakingly researched and he characteristically spent long hours studying censuses and other government publications for the precise facts and figures that he believed should inform his opinions. Consequently, he was typically always able to back up his opinions with great quantities of evidence as well as with a clear and sophisticated application of logic. This earned him considerable respect, even from his political opponents.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.samj.org.za/1934%20VOL%20VIII%20Jan-Dec/Articles/03%20March/2.5%20REMINISCENCES%20-%20S.A.%20EXPERIENCES.%20W.%20Darley-Hartley.pdf W. Darley-Hartley (1934) ''Reminiscences – South African Experiences'' Vol.8]&lt;/ref&gt; 
An example is the cautious and guarded homage which writer Stanley Little, a political opponent, later paid to Saul Solomon in his 1887 work on the Cape's political leadership. 
{{Quote
|text= The Honourable Saul Soloman[sic], whom I may call Molteno's ghost, is without doubt the ablest man South Africa has produced. Without his support few Ministers could hold office for long. He is the most remarkable statesman in the Cape. It is he who can pull the wires and bring Jack's house tumbling down about his ears whenever he likes. An able debater, a splendid fighter, an energetic, consistent, upright man, he deserves all honour and praise. He has led a life of steadfast consistency, and has conferred benefits upon the colony, which must earn for his name the unswerving veneration of generations of South Africans yet to come. He secured for the Cape the boon of representative institutions, he stimulated her energies in all matters educational, and that grand educational establishment, the South African College, is vastly his debtor. He has been ever foremost in making every effort to provide for suitable instruction for the people. As to his native policy, he thoroughly believes he is right there. He is animated by noble, generous impulses, but here, if I may make bold to say so, in criticising so great a man, I think his goodness of heart has somewhat thwarted the soundness of his judgment. His whole life has been devoted to preaching the doctrine of the equality of all races and classes. I believe this to be a fallacy, a bitter, mournful fallacy. The French encyclopaedists were all wrong, these ideas are utter nonsense.

His progressive views on equal rights extended to gender relations (for his marriage ceremony he famously asked that his wife should not have to vow to "obey" him), religion (He never officially renounced his [[Judaism]], but he abhorred sectarian attitudes and attended churches as often as synagogues) and class (He asked his employees and household servants to simply call him "Saul").

He lived at Clarensville House in [[Sea Point]], [[Cape Town]] for most of his life. He married [[Georgiana Solomon|Georgiana Margaret Thomson]] at his house on 21 March 1874. She was a head teacher 29 to his age of 56.&lt;ref name=geogiana/&gt; He and Georgiana enjoyed welcoming guests as varied as [[Cetewayo]], King of the [[Zulu people|Zulus]], and the future Kings, [[Edward VII|Princes Edward]] and [[George V|George]]. However, after his daughter tragically drowned near their property in 1881, Solomon's health declined and he withdrew from public life, even handing his business over to his nephews.

He retired from public life completely in 1883 due to poor health and moved to [[Kilcreggan]], Scotland, in 1888. &lt;br&gt;
It was here that he died in 1892, of "Chronic tubular nephritis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancestry24.com/saul-solomon-portrait-of-a-liberal/|publisher=ancestry24.com|accessdate=5 November 2010|title=Saul Solomon.

Saul Solomon's extended family remained deeply involved in politics and law in southern Africa for many years – though they varied greatly in their political allegiance. In particular, his nephews [[Richard Solomon (barrister)|Sir Richard Solomon]] and [[Edward Philip Solomon]] were very influential at the time of the [[Anglo-Boer War|Boer War]] and the lead up to the [[Union of South Africa]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://1820gw.wikispaces.com/2.4++Edward+Solomon+Family |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710192915/http://1820gw.wikispaces.com/2.4++Edward+Solomon+Family |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 July 2012 |title=1820gw – 2.4 Edward Solomon Family |publisher=1820gw.wikispaces.com |date=13 June 1930 |accessdate=2012-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; their brother [[William Henry Solomon|William Henry]] became the Union's [[Chief Justice of South Africa|Chief Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genetika.co.uk/histories/Solomon.pdf|title=Solomon Family of South Africa Biography|last=Bain|first=Margot|date=January 2014|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon's wife [[Georgina Solomon|Georgiana]] survived him by over 40 years, and was an influential suffragette.

''' Takis M. Klerides''' (in Greek ''' Τάκης Κληρίδης '''), born 1951 in [[Nicosia]], is a Greek Cypriot accountant, banker and a politician. He served as a [[List of Minister of Finance of the Republic of Cyprus|Finance Minister of Cyprus]] under president [[Glafcos Clerides]] from 19 March 1999 until 28 February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mof.gov.cy/mof/mof.nsf/page14_en/page14_en?OpenDocument&amp;print |title= Previous Ministers of Finance – Ministry of Finance |publisher=mof.gov.cy|date=1 January 2006|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Takis Klerides was born in Nicosia, Cyprus, in 1951.  He earned his [[Business studies]] degree in England and then qualified as a member of the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA) in England, having completed the examinations in 1974.  He is now a Fellow of ACCA and a member of the [[Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Cyprus]] (ICPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stockwatch.com.cy/nqcontent.cfm?a_name=itrade_view&amp;bodn_id=3126 |title= Insider Trader Clerides Takis – Stockwatch Cyprus|publisher=stockwatch.com.cy|date=16 July 2012|accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduation Kleridis worked for a few years in England and Greece. He returned to Cyprus to join Metaxas Loizides Syrimis &amp; Co (later [[KPMG]] [[Cyprus]]), Accountants, Auditors, Consultants, where he became a partner in 1981.  He left [[KPMG]] in March 1999 when he was appointed Minister of Finance of the Republic of Cyprus, a post he held until February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markets.ft.com/research/Markets/Tearsheets/Directors-and-dealings?s=LOGMEUR:STO |title= Logicom Public Ltd. – Financial Times |publisher=markets.ft.com|date=10 January 2008|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Union==
In his speech to the House of Representatives in November 2002, Klerides outlined that during 2001 and 2002 the [[Economy of Cyprus]] faced an adverse external environment. Nevertheless, as the Minister pointed out, the Government set specific strategic goals and succeeded in achieving them. These include the positive record in macroeconomic stability, manifested in the low [[inflation rate]] and the containment of the [[fiscal deficit]] below 3% of GDP, thus fulfilling the corresponding [[Maastricht Treaty]] criterion, the improvement of the standard of living, the enhancement of competitiveness and the modernisation of the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyprusembassy.net/home/index.php?module=article&amp;id=569 |title= Speech of the Finance Minister, Mr. Takis Klerides, On the Budget – Cyprus Embassy |publisher=cyprusembassy.net|date=10 October 2002|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyprus Stock Market Bubble==
The 1999–2000 [[Cyprus Stock Exchange]] bubble took place while Klerides was serving as finance minister. There have been several calls in the Cypriot media for tighter regulation to prevent [[Financial crimes]] and [[white collar crime]] as investigating authorities attempted to get at the root cause, in which investors lost millions as the result of artificially inflated share prices. In a report released in 2002 by local newspaper [[Cyprus Weekly]], it praised the activities of the Watchdog Committee of the House of Representatives, which investigated the causes of the bubble and called for tighter supervision of auditors, increased powers for regulators and greater public education to ensure that such a situation does not arise again. Likening the 2000 crisis to the aftermath of the collapse of [[Enron]], the newspaper called for new standards to ensure the independence of auditors from CSE activities. The report also called for an increase in the investigative powers of the Cyprus SEC ([[CySEC]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tax-news.com/news/Cyprus_Stock_Market_Bubble_Raises_Awareness_Of_Financial_Fraud____7416.html |title= Cyprus Stock Market Bubble Raises Awareness of Financial Fraud – Tax-News |publisher=tax-news.com|date=25 February 2002|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tax-news.com/news/Transaction_Tax_Gives_Cyprus_Stock_Exchange_New_Stability_Fund____3018.html |title= Transaction Tax Gives Cyprus Stock Exchange New Stability Fund – Tax-News |publisher=tax-news.com|date=6 April 2001|accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/252180 |title= Med sea bubble – The Economist |publisher=Economist.com|date=21 October 1999|accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is notable for his liberal stance, striving for a national [[Constitution]], the full [[rule of law]] and equality before the law. He was also the leader of [[Free Princes Movement]].

Following tradition, Munaiyir became known as Umm Talal, "mother of Talal". However, in 1927, the three-year-old Talal died. In 1931, Talal was born and named in honor of his late brother, following the Bedouin tradition. It is unknown when Abdulaziz divorced his fourth wife and formally wed Munaiyir.

Prince Talal was the full brother of [[Nawwaf bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Prince Nawwaf]]. During the reign of their half brother [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Saud]], they became bitter enemies, to the point of contesting their inheritances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kechichian|first=Joseph A.|title=Succession in Saudi Arabia|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|pages=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=79Fs5bLPgBYC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=succession+in+saudi+arabia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YFljq6DjSQ&amp;sig=jUyMCiI4Fo3DWpozWA8fR6pC9jY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CuZ-T7bEK9Gp0AWAuoGTBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=succession%20in%20saudi%20arabia&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions held==

===Minister of Communications===
Prince Talal became one of the wealthiest young princes but his bureau suffered major corruption problems.&lt;ref name="hertog"/&gt; Prince Talal was made minister of communications when the office was established in 1952.&lt;ref name=mcit&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief History|url=http://www.mcit.gov.sa/english/AboutMCIT/BriefHistory/|publisher=Ministry of Communications and Information Technology|accessdate=31 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718175355/http://mcit.gov.sa/english/AboutMCIT/BriefHistory/|archivedate=18 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, King Abdulaziz created the ministry of air force to prevent all flight-related matters from his administration.&lt;ref name="hertog"/&gt; Because Prince Talal and [[Mishaal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Prince Mishaal]] contended over who controlled the national airlines, Saudi Arabia was to have two separate fleets.&lt;ref name="hertog"/&gt; The dispute ended when Prince Talal resigned in April 1955.&lt;ref name="hertog"&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Hertog|title=Princes Brokers and Bureaucrats Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YNM4vMi7FtcC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=21 July 2013|date=23 February 2011|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-5753-1|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the ministry of communication was merged with the ministry of finance after Prince Talal's resignation.&lt;ref name="hertog"/&gt; This allowed King Saud to skip choosing Talal's successor, which would have caused friction in the royal family no matter who King Saud choose.&lt;ref name="hertog"/&gt;

===Minister of Finance and National Economy===

However, King Saud had no intention or plan to reform the political system. Therefore, he forced Prince Talal to resign from the cabinet.&lt;ref name=nehme94&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nehme|first=Michel G.|title=Saudi Arabia 1950-80: Between Nationalism and Religion|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|date=October 1994|volume=30|issue=4|pages=930–943|jstor=4283682|doi=10.1080/00263209408701030}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Prince Nawwaf succeeded him in the post.&lt;ref name=Oron/&gt;

== Controversy ==

===Free Princes Movement===
After Prince Talal's palaces were searched by the National Guard while he was abroad, he held a press conference in [[Beirut]] on 15 August 1962. His statements caused a stir since he openly criticized and attacked the Saudi regime. As a consequence, his [[Saudi Arabian passport|passport]]  was withdrawn, his property confiscated, and some of his supporters in [[Saudi Arabia]] arrested. Soon the [[North Yemen Civil War]]  began, and one week later, four crews of [[Saudi Arabian Airlines]] defected to [[Egypt]]. Prince Talal adopted the name of the '[[Free Princes]]' in [[Cairo]] on 19 August 1962, and broadcast his progressive views on the [[Radio Cairo]]. Later, he and two of his brothers, [[Fawwaz bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Prince Fawwaz]] and [[Badr bin Abdul Aziz|Prince Badr]],&lt;ref name=shenderson94&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson|first=Simon|title=After King Fahd|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/uploads/Documents/pubs/PP_37_AFTERKINGFAHD.pdf|publisher=Washington Institute|accessdate=2 February 2013|format=Policy Paper|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of his cousins, Prince Saad, began to make statements on behalf of the [[Saudi Liberation Front]]. After four years, during which [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]] offered tremendous financial inducements to the Free Princes, the latter were again reconciled with the royal family.&lt;ref name=nehme94/&gt;

His return to Saudi Arabia and rehabilitation was made possible through the mediation of his mother, Munaiyir. In exile, his own family did not support him and even criticized him for his intensive sympathy with then Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], Saudi Arabia’s foremost enemy. On 8 September 1963, ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' reported that Talal’s mother, Munaiyir, advised her son that he was behaving foolishly while his younger sister Madawi kept asking him to return home. A few days later, Prince Talal returned to Saudi Arabia. [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|King Faisal]] was reported not to forgive Prince Talal but privately assured his mother that his assets would be unfrozen and that he could safely return home.&lt;ref name=stig/&gt;

==Views==
After the [[September 11 attacks]], Prince Talal challenged the "potentially very confusing" claim that rulers and religious scholars should jointly decide affairs of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bronson|first=Rachel|title=Rethinking Religion: The Legacy of the U.S.-Saudi Relationship|journal=The Washington Quarterly|year=2005|volume=28|issue=4|pages=121–137|url=http://www.mafhoum.com/press8/249P5.pdf|doi=10.1162/0163660054798672}}&lt;/ref&gt; He openly stated his support for the establishment of an elected assembly in Saudi Arabia in 2001.&lt;ref name="Eur2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eur|title=The Middle East and North Africa 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4CfBKvsiWeQC&amp;pg=PA949|accessdate=1 September 2012|date=22 November 2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-85743-132-2|pages=952}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, he announced his desire to form a political party to advance his goal of liberalizing the country.&lt;ref name=dotto2010&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi Arabia’s Ailing Gerontocracy|url=http://www.davidottaway.com/?p=15|accessdate=21 July 2013|work=David Ottoway|date=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Prince Talal stated, "King Abdullah is the ruler. If he wills it, it will be done."&lt;ref name=abe30sep&gt;{{cite news|last=Allam|first=Abeer|title=The House of Saud: rulers of modern Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/75aae7ea-cc82-11df-a6c7-00144feab49a.html#axzz2ZnRVkP6q|accessdate=22 July 2013|newspaper=Financial Times|date=30 September 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in March 2009, he called on [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]] to clarify the appointment of [[Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud|Prince Nayef]] as second deputy prime minister.&lt;ref name=reuters2&gt;{{cite news|last=Karam|first=Souhail|title=Saudi prince questions king's deputy appointment|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/28/saudi-government-talal-idUSLS38750520090328|accessdate=1 June 2012|work=Reuters|date=28 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He publicly questioned whether it would make Prince Nayef the next [[crown prince]].&lt;ref name=reuters2/&gt; Prince Nayef was in fact named crown prince in October 2011 following the death of his brother, [[Sultan bin Abdulaziz|Prince Sultan]]. Prince Talal was a member of the [[Allegiance Council]] when the members were named in 2007. He resigned from the Council in November 2011, apparently in protest of late Prince Nayef's appointment as Crown Prince. In April 2012, he said that the "hand of justice" should reach all the corrupt in Saudi Arabia, and called on the National Anti-Corruption Authority (NACA) to reach everyone, regardless of status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Admon|first=Y.|title=First Signs of Protest by Sunnis in Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/6245.htm|accessdate=5 April 2012|publisher=MEMRI|date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his June 2012 ''[[Al Quds Al Arabi]]'' interview, Prince Talal stated that the princes on [[Allegiance Council|the Allegiance Council]] were not consulted on the succession of [[Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Prince Salman]] and that the Council became ineffective.&lt;ref name=islamtimes12&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi Allegiance council ineffective: Saudi prince Talal|url=http://www.islamtimes.org/vdcevx8zpjh8f7i.1kbj.html|accessdate=22 June 2012|work=Islam Times|date=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also called for establishing a [[constitutional monarchy]] in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=islamtimes12 /&gt;

The '''Travelex Confidence Index''' (TCI) is an economic barometer for UK [[international trade]], offering a snapshot of the opinions of UK importers and exporters' views on the international trade situation. It explores the effect fiscal tightening has on importers and exporters and their expectations for business growth over the next 6 to 12 months.

==Sample==
The Travelex Confidence Index is conducted for [[Travelex|Travelex Global Business Payments]] by TNS-RI, the global research company.

200 senior decision makers at UK companies (Financial Directors, Chief Financial Officers, and others) with up to £100m turnover are interviewed each month. All of the companies interviewed are independent of Travelex’s business client base.

The sample is drawn from importers and exporters based across [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] and across a range of industries like manufacturing, construction, retail and wholesale.

==Methodology==

The sample is interviewed each month using the [[Computer-assisted telephone interviewing]], to ensure a thorough interview. The overall confidence index is made up of three indices: the International Trade Index, the Current Situation Index, and the Expectations Index.

==Media coverage==

The Travelex Confidence Index has been widely followed in the media, including the [[BBC]], [[CNBC]], ''The Times'', ''FT Adviser'', ''Interactive Investor'' and the ''Evening Standard''.
