'''ActiveReports''' is a [[.NET Framework|.NET]] reporting tool used by developers of [[WinForms]], [[ASP.NET]], and [[HTML5]] applications. It was originally developed by [[Data Dynamics]], which was then acquired by [[GrapeCity]]. ActiveReports is a set of components and tools that facilitates the production of reports to display data in documents and web-based formats. It is written in managed C# code and allows [[Visual Studio]] programmers to leverage their knowledge of C# or [[Visual Basic.NET]] when programming with ActiveReports.

Among the components included with ActiveReports are exports to file formats such as [[PDF]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]], and [[TIFF]]. The main components are a [[Visual Studio]] integrated report designer, and an API that developers use to create customized reports from a variety of data sources. ActiveReports Standard Edition also includes a Visual Query Designer, a customizable Windows Viewer control, an [[HTML5]] Viewer control, and a [[Windows Presentation Foundation|WPF]] Viewer control.

The integrated report designer handles three types of reports:

* Section Reports with banded sections like the original ActiveReports (reminiscent of [[Microsoft Access]] reports)
* Page Reports with a fixed layout for forms 
* RDL Reports with a continuous page layout like the original Data Dynamics Reports (uses [[Report Definition Language]])

The Professional Edition of ActiveReports includes the Standard Edition tools plus an End-User Report Designer control that developers use to host the report designer in their own Microsoft Windows applications to let end users create and modify reports. It also includes a server-side ASP.NET web viewer with Flash, PDF, and HTML viewer types; ASP.NET HTTP Handlers that export reports to HTML or PDF format without custom code; a [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]] viewer; and advanced PDF encryption and rendering features.

==ActiveReports Server==
ActiveReports Server is a [[Scalability|scalable]] server platform with built in [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]]. It provides a secure and [[Extensibility|extensible]] report server to publish reports designed in ActiveReports. A comprehensive [[Representational state transfer|RESTful API]] enables integration of the [[Responsive web design|responsive]] [[HTML5]] Report Portal for end users to view, schedule and export reports.

==Known Issues==

In the past, ActiveReports was known to be unable to handle large reports.&lt;ref&gt;http://forums.asp.net/p/1454550/3327154.aspx?Re+System+Out+of+Memory+Exception+active+reports+asp+net+C+&lt;/ref&gt; This issue was ongoing across years and versions.&lt;ref&gt;http://arhelp.grapecity.com/groups/topic/approach-to-building-a-large-report/#post-502669&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9365434/pdf-tmp-file-are-not-deleted-and-out-of-memory-exception-when-cachetodisk-is-us&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, development efforts have focused on improving large report handling in every release.

ActiveReports can be used in many ways, so each project can have a number of reasons for consuming memory. In newer versions, CacheToDisk and CacheToDiskLocation properties were added for PDF exports. Some other considerations that may cause too much memory use in section reports include:&lt;ref&gt;http://arhelp.grapecity.com/webhelp/AR10/index.html#OptimizingActiveReports.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* Large or repeated images on every page 
* Subreports in repeating sections instantiated in the wrong event so that many new instances are created instead of one
* Summaries in header sections that delay rendering 
* Report and Document object instances not released from memory

==History==
[[File:Museum Mandiri.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bank Mandiri Museum|Museum Mandiri]], the former building of Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij that was nationalised after the independence period.]]
[[File:Bank Mandiri (1998-2008).svg|thumb|left|The former logo of Bank Mandiri, used until January 2008.]]
Bank Mandiri is the result of the merger made by Indonesian Government from four older government-owned banks that failed in 1998. Those four banks were Bank Bumi Daya (BBD), Bank Dagang Negara (BDN), Bank Expor Impor (Exim), and Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo). During the amalgamation and reorganisation, the government reduced the number of branches by 194 and the number of personnel from 26,600 to 17,620.

*1951: Bank Industri Negara (BIN) was established to finance priority sectors, such as plantations, industry and mining.
*1959: The Indonesia government nationalised [[Nationale Handelsbank]]'s operations in Indonesia and from them created Bank Umum Negara.
*1960: The Indonesia government nationalised the Indonesian operations of two more Dutch banks.  It used [[Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij]]'s operations to create Bank Ekspor Impor Indonesia.  [[List of defunct banks of the Netherlands|Escomptobank]] became Bank Dagang Negara. The government also established the state-owned Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo) and merged BIN into it.  Bapindo specialised in medium and long-term financing of manufacturing, tourism and transportation.
*1964: The Indonesia government nationalised Chartered Bank's operations in Indonesia and merged them into Bank Umum Negara.  [[Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China|Chartered Bank]], a British overseas bank, had first entered Indonesia in 1863 when it opened an agency in Batavia.
*1965: The Indonesia government brought Bank Umum Negara into the [[Bank Negara Indonesia]] group, renaming it Bank Negara Indonesia Unit IV (BNI IV). Similarly, Bank Ekspor Impor Indonesia became Bank Negara Indonesia Unit II (BNI II).
*1968: The Indonesian government again reorganised some banks.  BNI IV became an independent bank with the name Bank Bumi Daya. The government split BNI II into two parts, with the BNI Unit II Export-Import Division becoming BankExim, which specialised in trade finance.
*1986: Bapindo expanded into general commercial banking.
*1999: The government merged Bank Bumi Daya, Bank Dagang Negara, Bank Ekspor Impor Indonesia and Bank Pembangunan Indonesia to create Bank Mandiri.&lt;ref&gt;http://ir.bankmandiri.co.id/phoenix.zhtml?c=146157&amp;p=irol-homeProfile&lt;/ref&gt;
*2004: The bank opened a branch in [[Dili]] ([[East Timor]]), and a representative office in Shanghai (China).

{{Competition law}}

'''Conscious parallelism''' is a term used in [[competition law]] to describe pricing strategies among competitors in an [[oligopoly]] that occurs without an actual agreement between the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eui.eu/RSCAS/Research/Competition/2006(pdf)/200610-COMPed-Allendesalazar.pdf |title=Oligopolies, Conscious Parallelism and Concertatio |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, one competitor will take the lead in raising or lowering prices. The others will then follow suit, raising or lowering their prices by the same amount, with the understanding that greater profits result.

This practice can be harmful to consumers who, if the market power of the firm is used, can be forced to pay monopoly prices for goods that should be selling for only a little more than the cost of production. Nevertheless, it is very hard to prosecute because it may occur without any collusion between the competitors. Courts have held that no violation of the antitrust laws occurs where firms independently raise or lower prices, but that a violation can be shown when "plus factors" occur, such as firms being motivated to collude and taking actions against their own economic interests.&lt;ref&gt;
Kevin Scott Marshall, Stephen H. Kalos, ''The Economics of Antitrust Injury and Firm-specific Damages'' (2008), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used to describe industry-wide assumption of terms other than price. For example, all competitors in an industry might make only long-term leases of products such as heavy machinery, leaving lessors with no opportunity to make a short-term lease of that product from any competitor.

==History==
The term ''school leadership'' came into currency in the late 20th century for several reasons. Demands were made on schools for higher levels of pupil achievement, and schools were expected to improve and reform. These expectations were accompanied by calls for accountability at the school level. Maintenance of the ''status quo'' was no longer considered acceptable. ''Administration'' and ''management'' are terms that connote stability through the exercise of control and supervision. The concept of leadership was favored because it conveys dynamism and pro-activity. The [[Head teacher|principal]] or school head is commonly thought to be the school leader; however, school leadership may include other persons, such as members of a formal leadership team and other persons who contribute toward the aims of the school.

While ''school leadership'' or ''educational leadership'' have become popular as replacements for ''educational administration'' in recent years, ''leadership'' arguably presents only a partial picture of the work of school, division or district, and ministerial or state education agency personnel, not to mention the areas of research explored by [[Faculty (university)|university faculty]] in departments concerned with the operations of schools and educational institutions. For this reason, there may be grounds to question the merits of the term as a catch-all for the field.  Rather, the [[etiology]] of its use may be found in more generally and con-temporarily experienced [[neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] social and economic governance models, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom. On this view, the term is understood as having been borrowed from business.

In the United States, the [[Superintendent (education)|superintendency]], or role of the chief school administrator, has undergone many changes since the creation of the position—which is often attributed to the [[Buffalo Common Council]] that approved a superintendent on June 9, 1837. If history serves us correctly, the superintendency is about 170 years old with four major role changes from the early 19th century through the first half of the 20th century and into the early years of the 21st century. Initially, the superintendent's main function was clerical in nature and focused on assisting the board of education with day-to-day details of running the school. At the turn of the 20th century, states began to develop common [[curriculum]] for public schools with superintendents fulfilling the role of teacher-scholar or master educator who had added an emphasis on curricular and instructional matters to school operations. In the early 20th century, the [[Industrial Revolution]] affected the superintendent's role by shifting the emphasis to expert manager with efficiency in handling non-instructional tasks such as budget, facility, and transportation. The release of ''A Nation at Risk ''in 1983 directly impacted public school accountability and, ultimately, the superintendency. The early 1980s initiated the change that has continued through today with the superintendent viewed as chief executive officer, including the roles of professional adviser to the [[Board of education|board]], leader of reforms, manager of resources and communicator to the public.

==Graduate studies==
The term "educational leadership" is also used to describe programs beyond schools.  Leaders in community colleges, proprietary colleges, community-based programs, and [[University|universities]] are also ''educational leaders''.

Some United States university graduate [[Master's degree|masters]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral]] programs are organized with [[higher education]] and [[adult education]] programs as a part of an educational leadership department.  In these cases, the entire department is charged with educating ''educational leaders'' with specific specialization areas such as university leadership, [[community college]] leadership, and community-based leadership (as well as school leadership). [[Master's degree|Masters of education]] are offered at a number of universities around the United States in traditional and online formats including the [[University of Texas at El Paso]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coe.utep.edu/edlf/|title=College of Education|website=coe.utep.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Massachusetts]], [[Saint Mary's University of Minnesota]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Masters in Educational Leadership|url=http://onlineprograms.smumn.edu/mael/masters-in-educational-leadership|publisher=[[Saint Mary's University of Minnesota]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pepperdine University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsep.pepperdine.edu/masters-educational-leadership-administration/|title=MA in Administrative Services - Master of Arts in Educational Administration Degree Program - Pepperdine University GSEP|website=gsep.pepperdine.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Capella University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capella.edu/online-degrees/masters-leadership-educational-administration/|title=Masters in Educational Leadership &amp; Administration Online - Capella University|website=www.capella.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northcentral University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncu.edu/programs-degrees/education/educational-leadership|title=Educational Leadership}} {{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520032503/https://www.ncu.edu/school-of-education/doctor-of-philosophy-in-education/educational-leadership/|archivedate=2013-05-20|url=https://www.ncu.edu/school-of-education/doctor-of-philosophy-in-education/educational-leadership/|title=Original link}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Scranton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Master of Educational Administration|url=http://www.uscranton.com/online-educational-administration/|publisher=[[University of Scranton]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some United States [[Graduate school|graduate programs]] with a tradition of graduate education in these areas of specialization have separate departments for them. The area of higher education may include areas such as student affairs leadership, academic affairs leadership, community college leadership, community college and university teaching, [[Vocational education|vocational]], adult education and university administration, and educational wings of nongovernmental organizations.

In Europe, similar degrees exist at the [[University of Bath]] and [[Apsley Business School - London]], where the focus is on the management systems of education, especially as British schools move away from state funding to semi-autonomous Free Schools and Academies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2304/rcie.2011.6.2.170|title=Free Choice, Free Schools and the Academisation of Education in England|first=Paul|last=Miller|date=1 June 2011|publisher=|journal=Research in Comparative and International Education|volume=6|issue=2|pages=170–182|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.2304/rcie.2011.6.2.170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apsley.eu/portfolio-view/mba-in-educational-leadership/|title=MBA in Educational Leadership|website=apsley.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact in these schools, the focus is on traditional MBA disciplines, such as HR, Change Management and Finance. The so-called "Academisation" of British education is highly contentious and political issue &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/feb/11/academies-schools-education-policy|title=The headteachers who fought off the academy brokers|first=Rhonda|last=Evans|date=11 February 2013|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many headteachers resisting moves to what they see as forced privatization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schoolsweek.co.uk/schools-requiring-improvement-face-academisation/|title=Schools ‘requiring improvement’ face academisation - Schools Week|date=2 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mainland Europe, Educational Leadership is not taught formally, with senior educationalists having come through academic pathways, not administration &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X021004004|title=Educational Leadership and the Crisis of Democratic Government|first=Henry A.|last=Giroux|date=1 May 1992|publisher=|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=21|issue=4|pages=4–11|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.3102/0013189X021004004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature, research and policy==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
Educational leadership draws upon interdisciplinary literature, generally, but ideally distinguishes itself through its focus on [[pedagogy]], [[epistemology]] and [[Developmental psychology|human development]]. In contemporary practice it borrows from [[political science]] and business. Debate within the field relates to this tension.  Numerous educational leadership theories and perspectives have been presented and explored, such as: (a) [[instructional leadership]]; (b) [[Distributed Leadership|distributed leadership]]; (c) transformational leadership; (d) [[social justice educational leadership|social justice leadership]]; and (e) [[Teacher leadership]].  Researchers have explored how different practices and actions impact student achievement, teacher job satisfaction, or other elements related to school improvement.  Moreover, researchers continue to investigate the methodology and quality of principal preparation programs.

A number of publications and foundations are devoted to studying the particular requirements of leadership in these settings, and educational leadership is taught as an academic discipline at a number of universities.

Several countries now have explicit policies on school leadership, including policies and budgets for the training and development of school leaders.

In the USA, formal "curriculum audits" are becoming common, in which educational leaders and trained auditors evaluate school leadership and the alignment of curriculum with goals and objectives. Curriculum audits and [[curriculum mapping]] were developed by [[Fenwick W. English]] in the late 1970s.  The educational leaders and auditors who conduct the audits are certified by [[Phi Delta Kappa]]. Research shows how educational leadership influences student learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leithwood|first1=Kenneth|title=educational leadership|journal=educational leadership influences student learning|pages=3–36|url=http://www.wallacefoundation.org/knowledge-center/school-leadership/key-research/documents/how-leadership-influences-student-learning.pdf|ref=article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Federal financing for [[small business]]es in [[Canada]]''' is facilitated via a number of programs and agencies. Financing is available in the form of [[grants]] (sometimes called "non-repayable contributions"), [[loans]], [[loan guarantee]]s, [[Income Support|income support]] and [[subsidized]] hiring and/or training programs. The government also provides funding for no-cost or subsidized services to small businesses, including workshops, business plan consulting, education, and federally sponsored trade missions. Financing, and federally funded or subsidized services are available both to established businesses looking to grow or expand into new markets and to [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurs]] seeking to launch a new business.

==Definitions==
*[[Grant (money)|Grants]] – Grants or "non-repayable contributions" are essentially that: funding that does not need to be paid back.
*Loans – Loans may be low- or no-interest contributions.  Financing methods and repayment requirements vary from conventional loan arrangements to situations in which the business fronts the costs, submits the costs to the agency, receives reimbursement for all or a portion of the costs, and then at a pre-determined date, the business begins to pay back the loan.  Unlike most bank loans to small businesses, government loans  may be unsecured.
*Loan guarantees – Under the Canadian Small Business Financing Act,&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/C-10.2/index.html "Canada Small Business Financing Act (S.C. 1998, c. 36)"]. Justice Laws Website. Retrieved March 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; the federal government may guarantee a financial institution's loan to a small business, to a maximum of 85 percent.  If the borrower defaults on a loan, the bank is protected, and therefore more apt to offer small businesses financing.
*Income support – Various programs provide income support to entrepreneurs for fixed periods, often up to a year, so that they are not required to work or seek work while starting their businesses.
*[[Subsidy|Subsidies]] for hiring and training – In order to increase [[employment]] and to create qualified workers, the federal government funds a number of programs that allow employers to hire and/or train youth, unemployed individuals, and other target groups.
*Facilities subsidies – In some cases, facility rental and/or utilities may be subsidized for the small business
*[[Equity (finance)|Equity financing]] – The government may invest in a small business, with the advantage of less stringent demands than those of [[venture capital]]ists or other private investors.
*[[Tax refund]]s or [[tax credit]]s – Tax refunds and credits vary by industry and region.

==Funding Sources==
Funding and supportive services are administered by a variety of central, provincial, regional and local offices, including federal government departments, federal government agencies, non-profit corporations, financial institutions and chartered banks.  Programs may be targeted by industry, region, or other criteria, such as programs for young entrepreneurs or [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] entrepreneurs.  Application requirements for federal grants and loans programs vary, but often include at minimum a completed business plan.

[[File:Fine Chemicals, Commodities and Specialties.jpg|thumb|Definition of Fine Chemicals (as opposed to Commodities and Specialties)]]
'''Fine chemicals''' are complex, single, pure chemical substances, produced in limited quantities in multipurpose plants by multistep batch chemical or biotechnological processes. They are described by exacting specifications, used for further processing within the chemical industry and sold for more than $10/kg (see the comparison of fine chemicals, commodities and specialties). The class of fine chemicals is subdivided either on the basis of the added value (building blocks, [[advanced intermediates]] or [[active ingredients]]), or the type of business transaction, namely standard or exclusive products.

Fine chemicals are produced in limited volumes (&lt; 1000 tons/year) and at relatively high prices (&gt; $10/kg) according to exacting specifications, mainly by traditional [[organic synthesis]] in multipurpose [[chemical plant]]s. [[Biotechnology|Biotechnical]] processes are gaining ground. The global production value is about $85 billion. Fine chemicals are used as starting materials for specialty chemicals, particularly [[pharmaceuticals]], [[biopharmaceuticals]] and [[agrochemicals]]. [[Contract manufacturing organization|Custom manufacturing]] for the [[life science]] industry plays a big role; however, a significant portion of the fine chemicals total production volume is manufactured in house by large users. The industry is fragmented and extends from small, privately owned companies to divisions of big, diversified chemical enterprises. The term "fine chemicals" is used in distinction to "heavy chemicals", which are produced and handled in large lots and are often in a crude state.

Since their inception in the late 1970s, fine chemicals have become an important part of the chemical industry. The total production value of $85 billion is split about 60 / 40 among in-house production by the main consumers, the life science industry, on the one hand, and the fine chemicals industry on the other hand. The latter pursues both a “supply push” strategy, whereby standard products are developed in-house and offered ubiquitously, and a “demand pull” strategy, whereby products or services determined by the customer are provided exclusively on a “one customer / one supplier” basis. The products are mainly used as building blocks for proprietary products. The hardware of the top tier fine chemical companies has become almost identical. The design, lay-out and equipment of the plants and laboratories has become practically the same all over the world. Most chemical reactions performed go back to the days of the dyestuff industry. Numerous regulations determine the way labs and plants have to be operated, thereby contributing to the uniformity.

==History==
The term "fine chemicals" was in use as early as 1908&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last       = Stahl
| first      = A. F.
| date       = 1908

| volume     = 27
| pages      = 956
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the fine chemical industry as a distinct entity dates back to the late 1970s, when the overwhelming success of the histamine H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonists [[Tagamet]] (cimetidine) and [[Zantac]] (ranitidine hydrochloride) created a strong demand for advanced organic chemicals used in their manufacturing processes. As the in-house production capacities of the originators, the pharmaceutical companies Smith, Kline, &amp; French and Glaxo, could not keep pace with the rapidly increasing requirements, both companies (now merged as [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) outsourced part of the manufacturing to chemical companies experienced in producing relatively sophisticated organic molecules. [[Lonza Group|Lonza]], Switzerland, which already had supplied an early intermediate, methyl acetoacetate, during drug development, soon became the main supplier of more and more advanced precursors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pharmaceutical Substances|year=2009|pages=291–292|author1=A. Kleemann |author2=J. Engel |author3=B. Kutscher |author4=D. Reichert |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signature of a first, simple supply contract is generally acknowledged as the historical document marking the beginning of the fine chemical industry.

[[File:Founding document of the fine chemical industry.jpg|thumb|The beginning: supply contract between Smith Kline French and Lonza for cimetidine precursors]]

In the subsequent years, the business developed favorably and Lonza was the first fine chemical company entering in a [[strategic partnership]] with SKF. In a similar way, Fine Organics, UK became the supplier of the thioethyl-N’-methyl-2-nitro-1,1-ethenediamine [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] of ranitidine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pharmaceutical Substances|year=2009|pages=1189–1191|author1=A. Kleemann |author2=J. Engel |author3=B. Kutscher |author4=D. Reichert |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second H2 receptor antagonist, marketed  as Zantac by Glaxo. Other pharmaceutical and agrochemical companies gradually followed suit and also started outsourcing the procurement of fine chemicals. An example in case is [[Fabbrica Italiana Sintetici|F.I.S.]], Italy, which partnered with [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]], Switzerland for custom manufacturing precursors of the [[benzodiazepine]] class of tranquilizers, such as [[Librium]] (chlordiazepoxide HCl) and [[Valium]] (diazepam).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=US 3371085|year=1968 to Hoffmann-LaRoche|author1=E. Reeder |author2=L. H. Sternbach }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing complexity and potency of new pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals requiring production in multipurpose, instead of dedicated plants and, more recently,{{When|date=December 2012}} the advent of biopharmaceuticals had a major impact on the demand for fine chemicals and the evolution of the fine chemical industry as a distinct entity. For many years, however, the life science industry continued considering captive production of the active ingredients of their drugs and agrochemicals as a core competency. [[Outsourcing]] was recurred to only in exceptional cases, such as capacity shortfalls, processes requiring hazardous chemistry or new products, where uncertainties existed about the chance of a successful launch.

==Products==
In terms of molecular structure, one distinguishes first between low-molecular-weight (LMW) and high-molecular-weight (HMW) products. The generally accepted threshold between LMW and HMW is a [[molecular weight]] of about 700. LMW fine chemicals, also designated as small molecules, are produced by traditional chemical synthesis, by microorganisms ([[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] or [[biotransformation]]), or by [[extraction (chemistry)|extraction]] from plants and animals. In the production of modern life science products, total synthesis from petrochemicals prevails. The HMW products, respectively large molecules, are obtained mainly through biotechnology processes. Within LMWs, the N-heterocyclic compounds are the most important category; within HMWs they are the peptides and proteins.

===Small molecules===
As aromatic compounds have been exhausted to a large extent as building blocks for life science products, N-heterocyclic structures prevail nowadays. They are found in many natural products, such as chlorophyll; hemoglobin; and the vitamins [[biotin]], [[folic acid]], [[niacin]] (PP), [[pyridoxine]] (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), [[riboflavin]] (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[thiamine]] (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). In synthetic life science products, N-heterocyclic moieties are widely diffuses both pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. 
Thus, [[β-lactams]] are structural elements of [[penicillin]] and [[cephalosporin]] antibiotics, [[imidazoles]] are found both in modern herbicides, e.g. [[imazapyr|Arsenal]] (imazapyr) and pharmaceuticals, e.g. the antiulcerants Tagamet (cimetidine. see above) and [[Nexium]] (omeprazole), the antimycotics [[Daktarin]] (miconazole), [[Fungarest]] (ketoconazole) and [[Travogen]] ([[isoconazole]]). [[Tetrazoles]] and [[tetrazolidines]] are pivotal parts of the “[[Angiotensin II receptor antagonist|sartan]]” class of [[hypertensives]], e.g. [[Candesartan]] cilexetil (candesartan), [[Avapro]] (irbesartan), [[Cozaar]] (losartan) and [[Diovan]] (valsartan).
[[File:Valsartan.svg|thumb|Chemical Structure of Diovan (valsartan)]]

A vast array of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals are based on [[pyrimidines]], such as Vitamin B1 (thiamine), the sulfonamide antibiotics, e.g. [[Madribon]] (sulfadimethoxime) and –half a century later– the sulfonyl urea herbicides, e.g. [[Eagle]] (amidosulfuron) and [[Londax]] (bensulfuron-methyl). Benzodiazepine derivatives are the pivotal structural elements of breakthrough [[CNS Drugs]], such as Librium (chlordiazepoxide) and Valium (diazepam). Pyridine derivatives are found in both well-known [[Diquat]] and [[Chlorpyrifos]] herbicides, and in modern nicotinoid insecticides, such as [[Imidacloprid]].
Even modern [[pigments]], such as diphenylpyrazolopyrazoles, quinacridones, and engineering plastics, such as polybenzimidazoles, polyimides, and triazine resins, exhibit an N-heterocyclic structure.

===Big molecules===
''Big molecules'', also called ''high molecular weight'', HMW molecules, are mostly oligomers or polymers of small molecules or chains of amino acids. Thus, within pharma sciences, [[peptides]], [[proteins]] and [[oligonucleotides]] constitute the major categories.
''Peptides and proteins'' are oligomers or polycondensates of amino acids linked together by a carboxamide group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Andrew B.|title=Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins in Organic Chemistry|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Hoboken|location=Volumes 1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threshold between the two is as at about 50 amino acids. Because of their unique biological functions, a significant and growing part of new drug discovery and development is focused on this class of biomolecules. Their biological functions are determined by the exact arrangement or sequence of different amino acids in their makeup. For the synthesis of peptides, four categories of fine chemicals, commonly referred to as [[peptide building blocks]] (PBBs), are key, namely [[amino acids]] (=starting materials), protected amino acids, peptide fragments and peptides themselves. Along the way, the molecular weights increase from about 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; up to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and the unit prices from about $100 up to $10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; per kilogram. However, only a small part of the total amino acid production is used for peptide synthesis. In fact, [[L-glutamic acid]], [[D, L-methionine]], [[L-aspartic acid]] and [[L-phenylalanine]] are used in large quantities as food and feed additives. About 50 peptide drugs are commercialized. The number of amino acids that make up a specific peptide varies widely. At the low end are the [[dipeptides]]. The most important drugs with a dipeptide (L-alanyl-L-proline) moiety are the “-pril” [[cardiovascular drugs]], such as [[Alapril]] (lisinopril), [[Captoril]] (captopril), [[Novolac]] (imidapril) and [[Renitec]] (enalapril).  Also the artificial sweetener [[Aspartame]] (N-L-α-Aspartyl-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester) is a dipeptide. At the high end there is the anticoagulant [[hirudin]], MW ≈ 7000, which is composed of 65 amino acids.

Apart from pharmaceuticals, peptides are also used for diagnostics and vaccines. The total production volume (excl. Aspartame) of chemically synthesized, pure peptides is about 1500 kilograms and sales approach $500 million on the active pharmaceutical (API) level and $10 billion on the finished drug level, respectively. The bulk of the production of peptide drugs, which comprise also  the first generation anti-AIDS drugs, the “…navirs”, is outsourced to a few specialized contract manufacturers, such as [[Bachem]], Switzerland; Chengu GT Biochem, China; Chinese Peptide Company, China; Lonza, Switzerland, and [[Polypeptide]], Denmark.

''Proteins'' are “very high-molecular-weight” (MW &gt; 100,000) organic compounds, consisting of amino acid sequences linked by peptide bonds. They are essential to the structure and function of all living cells and viruses and are among the most actively studied molecules in biochemistry. They can be made only by advanced biotechnological processes; primarily [[mammalian cell cultures]]. [[Monoclonal antibodies]] (mAb) prevail among human-made proteins. About a dozen of them are approved as pharmaceuticals. Important modern products are [[Erythropoietin|EPO]] (Binocrit, NeoRecormon, erythropoietin), Enbrel (etanercerpt), [[Remicade]] (infliximab); [[MabThera/Rituxin]] (rituximab), and Herceptin (trastuzumab).
[[PEGylation]] is a big step forward regarding administration of peptide and protein drugs. The method offers the two-fold advantage of substituting injection by oral administration and reducing the dosage, and therefore the cost of the treatment. The pioneer company in this field is [[Prolong Pharmaceuticals]] which has developed a PEGylated erythropoietin (PEG-EPO).

''Oligonucleotides'' are a third category of big molecules. They are oligomers of [[nucleotides]], which in turn are composed of a five-carbon sugar (either [[ribose]] or [[desoxyribose]]), a nitrogenous base (either a pyrimidine or a purine) and 1–3 phosphate groups. The best known representative of a nucleotide is the [[coenzyme ATP]] (=[[Adenosine triphosphate]]), MW 507.2. Oligonucleotides are chemically synthesized from protected [[phosphoramidites]] of natural or chemically modified nucleosides. The oligonucleotide chain assembly proceeds in the direction from 3’- to 5’-terminus by following a procedure referred to as a “[[synthetic cycle]]”. Completion of a single synthetic cycle results in the addition of one nucleotide residue to the growing chain. The maximum length of synthetic oligonucleotides hardly exceeds 200 nucleotide components. From its current range of applications in basic research as well as in drug target validation, drug discovery, and therapeutic development, the potential use of oligonucleotides is foreseen in gene therapy ([[antisense]] drugs), disease prevention and agriculture.
 
''[[Antibody-drug conjugates]] (ADC)'' constitute a combination between small and big molecules. The small molecule parts, up to four different APIs, are highly potent [[cytotoxic]] drugs. They are linked with a monoclonal antibody, a big molecule which is of little or no therapeutic value in itself, but extremely discriminating for its targets, the cancer cells. The first commercialized ADCs were [[Isis]]’s [[Formivirisen]] and, more recently, Pfizer’s (formerly Wyeth) [[Mylotarg]] (gemtuzumab ozogamicin). Examples of ADCs in phase III of development are [[Abbott Laboratories|Abbott]]’s / Isis’s [[Alicaforsen]] and [[Eli Lilly]]’s [[Aprinocarsen]].

==Technologies==
Several key technologies are used for the production of fine chemicals, including
*Chemical synthesis, either from petrochemical starting materials or from natural products extracts
*Biotechnology, for small molecules [[biocatalysis]] (enzymatic methods), [[biosynthesis]] (fermentation), and, for big molecules, cell culture technology
*Extraction from animals, microorganisms, or plants; isolation and purification, used, for example, for alkaloids, [[antibacterials]] (especially penicillins), and steroids
*[[Hydrolysis]] of proteins, especially when combined with ion exchange chromatography, used, for instance, for amino acids
Chemical synthesis and biotechnology are most frequently used; sometimes also in combination.

===Traditional chemical synthesis===
A large toolbox of chemical reactions is available for each step of the synthesis of a fine chemical. The reactions have been developed on laboratory scale by academia over the last two centuries and subsequently adapted to industrial scale, for instance for the manufacture of dyestuffs &amp; pigments. The most comprehensive handbooks describing organic synthetic methods is ''Methods of Molecular Transformations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D. Bellus, S. V. Ley, R. Noyori et al. (Series editors)|title=Science of Synthesis: Houben-Weyl Methods of Molecular Transformations|year=2010|publisher=Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 10% of the 26,000 synthetic methods described therein are currently used on an industrial scale for fine chemicals production. [[Amination]], [[condensation]], [[esterification]], [[Friedel–Crafts]], [[Grignard reaction|Grignard]], [[halogenation]] (esp. chlorination), and [[hydrogenation]], respectively reduction (both catalytic and chemical) are most frequently mentioned on the websites of individual companies. Optically active [[cyanohydrins]], [[cyclopolymerization]], [[ionic liquids]], [[nitrone]]s, oligonucletides, peptide (both liquid- and solid-phase), [[electrochemical reactions]] (e.g., perfluorination) and [[steroid synthesis]] are promoted by only a limited number of companies. With the exception of some [[stereospecific]] reactions, particularly biotechnology, mastering these technologies does not represent a distinct competitive advantage. Most reactions can be carried out in standard multipurpose plants. The very versatile [[organometallic reactions]] (e.g., conversions with lithium aluminum hydride, boronic acids) may require temperatures as low as -100&amp;nbsp;°C, which can be achieved only in special cryogenic reaction units, either by using liquefied nitrogen as coolant or by installing a low-temperature unit. Other reaction-specific equipment, such as filters for the separation of catalysts, [[ozone]] or [[phosgene]] generators, can be purchased in many different sizes. The installation of special equipment generally is not a critical path on the overall project for developing an industrial-scale process of a new molecule.

Since the mid-1990s the commercial importance of ''[[single-enantiomer]]'' fine chemicals has increased steadily.  They constitute about half of both existing and developmental drug APIs. In this context, the ability to synthesize [[chiral]] molecules has become an important competency. Two types of processes are used, namely the physical separation of the enantiomers and the stereo specific synthesis, using chiral catalysts.  Among the latter, enzymes and synthetic [[BINAP]] (2,2´–Bis(diphenylphosphino)–1,1´–binaphthyl) types are used most frequently. Large volume (&gt; 103 mtpa) processes using chiral catalysts include the manufacture of the perfume ingredient [[l-Menthol]] and Syngenta’s [[Metolachlor|Dual]] (metolachlor) as well as BASF’s [[Herbicides|Outlook]] (dimethenamid-P) herbicides. Examples of originator drugs, which apply asymmetric technology, are [[AstraZeneca]]’s [[Nexium]] (esomeprazole) and [[Merck &amp; Co]]’s [[Januvia]] (sitagliptin). The physical separation of chiral mixtures and purification of the desired enantiomer can be achieved either by classical [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallization]] (having a “low-tech” image but still widely used), carried-out in standard multipurpose equipment or by various types of [[chromatographical separation]], such as standard column, [[simulated moving-bed]] (SMB) or [[supercritical fluid]] (SCF) techniques.

For ''peptides'' three main types of methods are used, namely chemical synthesis, extraction from natural substances, and biosynthesis. Chemical synthesis is used for smaller peptides made of up to 30–40 amino acids. One distinguishes between “liquid phase” and “solid phase” synthesis.  In the latter, reagents are incorporated in a resin that is contained in a reactor or column. The synthesis sequence starts by attaching the first amino acid to the reactive group of the resin and then adding the remaining amino acids one after the other. In order to ascertain a full selectivity, the amino groups have to be protected in advance. Most developmental peptides are synthesized by this method, which lends itself to automation. As the intermediate products resulting from individual synthetic steps cannot be purified, a selectivity of effectively 100% is essential for the synthesis of larger-peptide molecules. Even at a selectivity of 99% per reaction step, the purity will drop to less than 75% for a [[dekapeptide]] (30 steps). Therefore, for industrial quantities of peptides not more than 10–15 amino acid peptides can be made using the solid-phase method. For laboratory quantities, up to 40 are possible. In order to prepare larger peptides, individual fragments are first produced, purified, and then combined to the final molecule by liquid phase synthesis. Thus, for the production of Roche’s anti-AIDS drug [[Fuzeon]] (enfuvirtide), three fragments of 10–12 amino acids are first made by solid-phase synthesis and then linked together by liquid-phase synthesis. The preparation of the whole 35 amino acid peptide requires more than 130 individual steps.

[[Microreactor]] ''Technology'' (MRT), making part of “process intensification”,  is a relatively new tool that is being developed at several universities,&lt;ref&gt;Examples: Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETHZ), Switzerland; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), USA; Institut für Mikrotechnik (IMM), Germany; University of Washington (WU), USA; Micro-Chemical ProcessTechnology Research Association (MCPT), Japan.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as leading fine chemical companies, such as [[Bayer Technology Services]], Germany; [[Clariant]], Switzerland; [[Evonik-Degussa]], Germany; [[DSM (company)|DSM]], The Netherlands; [[Lonza Group|Lonza]], Switzerland;  [[PCAS (company)|PCAS]], France,  and [[Sigma-Aldrich]], US. The latter company produces about 50 fine chemicals up to multi-kilogram quantities in microreactors. From a technological point of view, MRT, a.k.a. continuous flow reactors, represents the first breakthrough development in reactor design since the introduction of the stirred-tank reactor, which was used by [[Perkin &amp; Sons]], when they set up a factory on the banks of what was then the Grand Junction Canal in London in 1857 to produce mauveïne, the first-ever synthetic purple dye. For a comprehensive coverage of the subject see ''Micro Process Engineering''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=V. Hessel |author2=A. Renken |author3=J.C. Shouten |author4=J. Yoshida |title=Micro Process Engineering|year=2009|publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag, Weiheim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples for reactions that have worked in microreactors include aromatics oxidations, diazomethane conversions, Grignards, halogenations, hydrogenations, nitrations, and Suzuki couplings. According to experts in the field, 70% of all chemical reactions could be done in microreactors, however only 10-15% are economically justified.

With the exception of some stereospecific reactions, particularly biotechnology, mastering these technologies does not represent a distinct competitive advantage. Most reactions can be carried out in standard multipurpose plants. Reaction-specific equipment, such as ozone or phosgene generators, is readily available.  The installation generally is not a critical path on the overall project for developing an industrial-scale process of a new molecule.
 
Whereas the overall demand for outsourced pharmaceutical fine chemicals is expected to increase moderately (''see'' Chapter 8), the estimated annual growth rates for the above-mentioned niche technologies are much higher. Microreactors and the SMB separation technology are expected to grow at a rate of even 50–100% per year. However, the total size of the accessible market typically does not exceed a few hundred tons per year at best.

===Biotechnology===
''Industrial biotechnology'', also called ''“[[white biotechnology]]”'' is increasingly impacting the chemical industry, enabling both the conversion of [[renewable resources]], such as sugar or vegetable oils, and the more efficient transformation of conventional raw materials into a wide range of commodities (e.g., [[cellulose]],  [[ethanol]] and [[succinic acid]]), fine chemicals (e.g. 6-aminopenicillanic acid), and specialties (e.g., food and feed additives).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wim Soetaert |author2=Erick J. Vandamme |title=), Industrial Biotechnology: Sustainable Growth and Economic Success|year=2010|publisher=J. Wiley &amp; Sons, Hoboken NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As opposed to green and red biotechnology, which relate to agriculture and medicine, respectively, white biotechnology enables the production of existing products in a more economic and sustainable fashion on the one hand, and provides  access to new products, especially biopharmaceuticals, on the other hand. It is expected that revenues from white biotechnology will account for 10%, or $250 billion, of the global chemical market of $2,500 billion by 2013. In ten to 15 years it is expected that most amino acids and vitamins and many specialty chemicals will be produced by means of biotechnology Three very different process technologies -biocatalysis, biosynthesis (microbial fermentation), and cell cultures- are used.

[[Biocatalysis]], a.k.a. [[biotransformation]] and [[bioconversion]], makes use of natural or modified isolated [[enzymes]], enzyme extracts, or [[whole-cell systems]] for enhancing the production of small molecules. It has much to offer compared to traditional organic synthesis. The syntheses are shorter, less energy intensive and generate less waste and hence, are both environmentally and economically more attractive. About 2/3 of chiral products produced on large industrial scale are already made using biocatalysis.  In the manufacture of fine chemicals, enzymes represent the single most important technology for radical cost reductions. This is particularly the case in the synthesis of molecules with chiral centres. Here, it is possible to substitute the formation of a salt with a chiral compound, e.g., [[(+)-α-phenylethylamine]], crystallization, salt breaking and recycling of the chiral auxiliary, resulting in a theoretical yield of not more than 50%, with a one step, high yield reaction under mild conditions and resulting in a product with a very high [[enantiomeric excess]] (ee). An example is [[AstraZeneca]]’s blockbuster drug [[Crestor]] (rosuvastatin), see Chemical / Enzymatic Synthesis of Crestor.

[[File:Synthesis of Crestor (rosuvastatin).jpg|thumb|Chemical / Enzymatic Synthesis of Crestor (rosuvastatin)]]

Further examples of modern drugs, where enzymes are used in the synthesis, are [[Pfizer]]’s [[Lipitor]] (atorvastatin), where the pivotal intermediate R-3-Hydroxy-4-cyanobutyrate is now made with a [[nitrilase]], and Merck &amp; Co.’s [[Singulair]] (montelukast), where the reduction of a ketone to S-alcohol, which had required stoichiometric amounts of expensive and moisture sensitive “[[(-)-DIP chloride]]” is now replaced by a [[ketoreductase]] enzyme catalyst step. Similar rewarding switches from chemical steps to enzymatic ones have also been achieved in steroid synthesis. Thus, it has been possible to reduce the number of steps required for the synthesis of [[Dexamethasone]] from bile from 28 to 15.  Enzymes differ from chemical catalysts particularly with regard to [[stereoselectivity]], [[regioselectivity]], and [[chemoselectivity]]. They can also be modified (“reshuffled”) for specific reactions, for use in chemical synthesis. “[[Immobilized enzymes]]” are those fixed on solid supports. They can be recovered by filtration after completion of the reaction. Conventional plant equipment can be used with no, or only modest, adaptations. The ''International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology'' (IUBMB)&lt;ref&gt;Secretary: Prof. M.P. Walsh. University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada T2N 4N1&lt;/ref&gt;  has developed a classification for enzymes. The main categories are [[Oxidoreductases]], [[Transferases]], [[Hydrolases]], [[Lipases]] (subcategory), [[Lyases]], Isomerases and [[Ligases]], 
Companies specializing in making enzymes are [[Novozymes]], [[Danisco]] (Genencor). [[Codexis]] is the leader in modifying enzymes to specific chemical reactions. 
The highest-volume chemicals made by biocatalysis are [[bio-ethanol]] (70 million metric tons), [[high-fructose corn syrup]] (2 million metric tons); [[acrylamide]], [[6-aminopenicillanic acid]] (APA), [[L-lysine]] and other amino acids, [[citric acid]] and [[niacinamide]] (all more than 10,000 metric tons).

''[[Biosynthesis]]'' i.e. the conversion of organic materials into fine chemicals by microorganisms, is used for the production of both small molecules (using enzymes in whole cell systems) and less complex, non-glycosylated big molecules, including peptides and simpler proteins. The technology has been used for 10,000 years to produce food products, like alcoholic beverages, cheese, yogurt, and vinegar. In contrast to biocatalysis, a biosynthetic process does not depend on chemicals as starting materials, but only on cheap natural feedstock, such as glucose, to serve as nutrient for the cells. The enzyme systems triggered in the particular microorganism strain lead to the excretion of the desired product into the medium, or, in the case of HMW peptides and proteins, to the accumulation within so-called [[inclusion bodies]] in the cells. The key elements of fermentation development are strain selection and optimization, as well as media and process development. Dedicated plants are used for large-scale industrial production. As the volume productivity is low, the bioreactors, called [[fermenters]], are large, with volumes that can exceed 250 m3. Product isolation was previously based on large-volume extraction of the medium containing the product. Modern isolation and membrane technologies, like [[reverse osmosis]], [[ultra]]- and [[nano-filtration]], or [[affinity chromatography]] can help to remove salts and by-products, and to concentrate the solution efficiently and in an environmentally friendly manner under mild conditions. The final purification is often achieved by conventional chemical crystallization processes. In contrast to the isolation of small molecules, the isolation and purification of microbial proteins is tedious and often involves a number of expensive large-scale chromatographic operations.
Examples of large-volume LMW products made by modern industrial microbial biosynthetic processes are [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG), [[vitamin B2]] (riboflavin), and [[vitamin C]] (ascorbic acid). In vitamin B2, riboflavin, the original six- to eight-step synthetic process starting from [[barbituric acid]] has been substituted completely by a microbial one-step process, allowing a 95% waste reduction and an approximately 50% manufacturing cost reduction. In ascorbic acid, the five-step process (yield ≈ 85%) starting from [[D-glucose]], originally invented by [[Tadeus Reichstein]] in 1933, is being gradually substituted by a more straightforward fermentative process with [[2-ketogluconic acid]] as pivotal intermediate. After the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Sir Alexander Fleming from colonies of the bacterium [[Staphylococcus aureus]], it took more than a decade before a powdery form of the medicine was developed. Since then, many more antibiotics and other [[secondary metabolites]] have been isolated and manufactured by microbial fermentation on a large scale. Some important antibiotics besides penicillin are [[cephalosporins]], [[azythromycin]], [[bacitracin]], [[gentamycin]], [[rifamycin]], [[streptomycin]], [[tetracycline]], and [[vancomycin]].

''[[Cell Cultures]]''
Animal or plant cells, removed from tissues, will continue to grow if cultivated under the appropriate nutrients and conditions. When carried out outside the natural habitat, the process is called cell culture. 
''[[Mammalian cell culture]]'' fermentation, also known as [[recombinant DNA technology]], is used mainly for the production of complex big molecule therapeutic proteins, a.k.a. biopharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Victor A. Vinci |author2=Sarad R. Parekh |title=Handbook of Industrial Cell Culture: Mammalian, Microbial, and Plant Cells|year=2010|publisher=Humana Press, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first products made were [[interferon]] (discovered in 1957), [[insulin]], and [[somatropin]]. Commonly used cell lines are [[Chinese hamster ovary]] (CHO) cells or plant cell cultures. The production volumes are very small. They exceed 100&amp;nbsp;kg per year for only three products: [[Rituxan]] ([[Roche-Genentech]]), [[Enbrel]] ([[Amgen]] and [[Merck &amp; Co]]. [formerly Wyeth]), and [[Remicade]] ([[Johnson &amp; Johnson]]). Fine chemical production by mammalian cell culture is a much more demanding operation than conventional biocatalysis and –synthesis. The bioreactor batch requires more stringent controls of operating parameters, since mammalian cells are heat and shear sensitive; in addition the growth rate of mammalian cells is very slow, lasting from days to several months. While there are substantial differences between microbial and mammalian technologies (e.g., the volume / value relationships are 10 $/kg and 100 tons for microbial, 1,000,000 $/kg and 10 kilograms for mammalian technology; the cycle times are 2–4 and 10–20 days, respectively), they are even more pronounced between mammalian and synthetic chemical technology (see Table 1).

The mammalian cell production process, as used for most biopharmaceuticals, is divided into the four main steps: (1) Cultivation, i.e. reproduction of the cells; (2) Fermentation, i.e. the actual production of the protein, typically in 10,000 Liter, or multiples, bioreactors; (3) Purification, i.e. separation of the cells from the culture medium and purification, mostly by chromatography, (4) Formulation, i.e. conversion of the sensitive proteins to a stable form.  All steps are fully automated. The low productivity of the [[animal culture]] makes the technology expensive and vulnerable to contamination. Actually, as a small number of bacteria would soon outgrow a larger population of animal cells. Its main disadvantages are low volume productivity and the animal provenance. It is conceivable that other technologies, particularly [[plant cell production]], will gain importance in future. Given the fundamental differences between the two process technologies, plants for mammalian cell culture technologies have to be built ex novo.

The pro’s and con’s of an involvement of a fine chemical company in cell culture technology are listed below:

Pros:
*Strong growth of demand: Today, biopharmaceuticals account for about $55–$80 billion, or 15% of the total pharmaceutical market. They are growing by 15% per year, i.e. three times faster than LMW drugs and are expected to pass the $150 billion per year threshold by 2015. Whereas just one out of the world’s top ten drugs was a biopharmaceutical in 2001, the number went up to five in 2010 (see table 6) and is expected to increase further to eight by 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expected Top Ten Drugs by 2016|url=http://www.evaluatepharma.com/Default.aspx|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (see Table 2).

*The likelihood of developing a new biopharmaceutical successfully is significantly greater than in traditional drug development.  25% of biopharmaceuticals that enter Phase I of the regulatory process eventually are granted approval. The corresponding figure for conventional drugs is less than 6%.
*The traditionally large share of outsourcing.
*Small number of custom manufacturers with industrial-scale manufacturing capabilities in this demanding technology. In the Western hemisphere, primarily [[Boehringer-Ingelheim]] of  Germany and [[Lonza Group|Lonza]] of Switzerland; in the Eastern hemisphere [[Nicholas Piramal]] of India (through the acquisition of a former Avecia operation)and the joint ventures between [[AutekBio]] and [[Beijing E-Town Harvest International]] in China and between [[Biocon]] in India and [[Celltrion]] in South Korea. 
*Same customer category: life science, especially the pharmaceutical industry.
*Similar business types: custom manufacturing of proprietary drugs; opportunities for generic versions, called [[biosimilars]].
*Similar regulatory environment: FDA regulations, especially GMP.
*Existing infrastructure (utilities, etc.) can be used.

Cons:
*High entry barriers because of demanding technology. The construction of a large-scale plant for the production of biopharmaceuticals by cell culture fermentation costs around $500 million and takes four to six years.
*As the specifications of the plant and process types for biopharmaceuticals differ substantially from traditional chemical synthesis, they cannot be produced in conventional multipurpose fine chemical plants.
*High financial exposure: (1) high capital intensity (‘massive investments are needed at a time when chances of success are still very low’ and (2) risk of batch failures ([[contamination]]).
*Unlike the biopharmaceutical start-ups, the emerging big biopharmaceutical companies are adopting the same opportunistic outsourcing policy as larger pharmaceutical companies. Thus, [[Amgen]], [[Biogen Idec]], [[Eli Lilly]], [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] (J&amp;J), [[Medimmune]], [[Novartis]], [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]]/[[Genentech]] and [[Pfizer]] are investing heavily in in-house manufacturing capacity. With three plants in the US, two in Japan and one each in Germany and Switzerland, Roche has the largest production capacity. 
*New developments in expression systems for mammalian and plant cell technology could reduce capacity requirements substantially. Actually, the titer in large-scale mammalian production, actually 2–3 grams/liter. is expected to double to 5–7 by 2015 and once more to 10 by 2020. Furthermore, the widespread application of ‘[[single-use disposable bioprocessing technology]]’, considered by experts as ‘the hottest buzz in town’. It advantageously substitutes for stainless steel production trains, at least for short production campaigns. 
*New [[transgenic production]] systems are emerging. They (e.g. [[transgenic moss]], [[lemna]], fungal or yeast expression systems, [[transgenic animals]] and plants, such as tobacco plants possess the potential to become economically and industrially successful.
*Legislation and regulation of biotechnology is not well defined yet and leads to differences in interpretation and other uncertainties. In the US, legislation is not yet in place for biosimilars, the generic counterpart of generics in small molecule pharmaceuticals.

The inherent risks of the mammalian cell technology led several companies to opt out of mammalian cell technology or to substantially reduce their stake. Examples are [[Cambrex]] and [[Dowpharma]] in the US, [[Avecia]], [[DSM (company)|DSM]] and Siegfried in Europe and [[WuXi App Tech]] in China.
In conclusion, biocatalysis should be, or become, part of the technology toolbox of any fine chemical company. Mammalian cell culture fermentation, on the other hand, should be considered only by large fine chemical companies with a full war chest and a long-term strategic orientation.

==The industry==
Within the chemical universe, the fine chemical industry is positioned between the commodity, their suppliers, and specialty chemical industries, their customers.  Depending on the services offered, there are two types of fine chemical companies. The ''Fine Chemical Companies'' are active in industrial scale production, both of standard and exclusive products. If the latter prevails, they are referred to as Fine Chemical / ''Custom Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs)''. The main assets of the [[Contract research organization|Contract Research Organizations]] (CROs) are their research laboratories. [[CRAMS]]; [[Contract Research and Manufacturing Organizations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=A. Gosh |author2=S. Ray |author3=G. Jain |author4=A. Arora |title=CRAMS India: Overview &amp; Outlook|year=2011|publisher=ICRA Ltd. Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are hybrids (see section 4.2).

===Fine Chemical / Custom Manufacturing Companies===
''Fine chemical / Custom Manufacturing companies'' in the narrower sense are active in process scale up, pilot plant (trial) production, industrial-scale exclusive and non-exclusive manufacture and marketing. Their product portfolios comprise exclusive products, produced by custom manufacturing, as main activity, non-exclusive products, e.g. API-for Generics, and standard products. Characteristics are high asset intensity, batch production in campaigns in multipurpose plants, above-industry-average R&amp;D expenditures and close, multi-level and multi-functional relationships with industrial customers. The industry is very fragmented. 2000 – 3000 fine chemical companies exist globally, extending from small, “garage-type” outfits in China making just one product, all the way to the big, diversified enterprises, resp. units. The main reason for the fragmentation is the lack of economy of scale (see below).

The industry is subject to a high degree of regulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Samuel L. Tuthill, Norman C. Jamieson, Kirk-Othmer|title=Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|year=2000|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Hoboken NJ|page=857|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;   even more so than the chemical industry as a whole, particularly if pharmaceutical fine chemical production is involved. The most important regulatory authorities are the ''[[(US) Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)'' and ''[[(Chinese) State Food &amp; Drug Administration]] (SFDA)'', respectively. Their main responsibilities comprise formulating comprehensive supervision policies (“[[Good Manufacturing Practice]]”) and control the implementation, to be in charge of drug registration, draw up criteria for marketing authorization and formulate national essential medicines lists. The European correspondent is the ''[[European Medicines Agency]] (EMEA)'', which is manly responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the European Union. The role of [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]] (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) is self-explanatory. The ''[[U.S. Pharmacopeia]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The U.S. Pharmacopeia 34 (USP 34 –NF29)|year=2011|publisher=The U.S Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., Rockville, MD.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  codifies quality standards for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. As these standards are observed worldwide, they contribute also to the emergence of a uniform worldwide set-up of the top tier fine chemical companies.
In terms of size, resources, and complexity of the chemical process technologies mastered, the fine chemical companies can be broadly divided into three segments, each of them accounting for approximately the same turnover, namely about $10 billion.
The top tier, about twenty, has sales in excess of $250 million per year (see Table 3). Most are not pure players but divisions or b.u.’s of large, multinational companies. Their share varies between one percent or less for [[BASF]] and [[Pfizer]], all the way to 100% for [[Cambrex]], USA; [[Divi’s Laboratories]], India, and [[Fabbrica Italiana Sintetici|F.I.S.]] Italy. All have extensive resources in terms of chemists and other specialists, plants, process knowledge, backwards integration, international presence, etc.

The combined revenues of the top 20 fine chemical companies amounted to $10 billion in 2009, representing about 30% of the figure for the whole industry. The leading companies are typically divisions of large, diversified chemical companies. In terms of geography, 9 of the top 20 are located in Europe, which is recognized as the cradle of the fine chemical industry. This is e.g. the case for the world’s #1 company, Lonza, headquartered in Basel. Switzerland. Custom manufacturing prevails in northern Europe; the manufacture of active substances for generics, in southern Europe. The second largest geographic area is Asia, housing 7 of the top 20. With 4 large companies, the US rank last.

Whereas the European and U.S. pharma industry constitutes the main customer base for most fine chemical companies, some have a significant share of products and services for the agrochemical industry. Examples are Archimica, CABB, Saltigo (all Germany), DSM (The Netherlands) and Hikal, India.
Several large pharmaceutical companies market fine chemicals as subsidiary activity to their production for captive use, e.g. [[Abbott Laboratories|Abbott]], USA; [[Bayer Schering Pharma]], [[Boehringer-Ingelheim]], Germany; [[Daiichi-Sankyo]] (after the takeover of [[Ranbaxy]]), Japan; Johnson &amp; Johnson, USA; [[Merck KGaA]], Germany; [[Pfizer]] (formerly Upjohn), US.
Large fine chemical companies, in contrast to mid-sized and small ones, are characterized by
*''A Lack of Economy in Size''. As most fine chemicals are produced in quantities of not more than a few 10 tons per year in multipurpose plants, there is little or no economy of size. The reactor trains of these plants are similar throughout the industry (see production train of a multipurpose plant). Regardless of the size of the companies, their main constituents, the reaction vessels, have a median size of the 4–6 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Various products are made throughout a year in campaigns. Therefore, the unit cost per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per hour does practically not vary with the size of the company.
*''A Dichotomy between Ownership and Management''. The company’s shares are listed on stock exchanges, and their performance is scrutinized by the financial community. Postponement of a single important shipment can affect a quarterly result. In the small and mid-sized companies the owners typically are the major shareholders, often members of the same family. Their shares are not traded publicly and fluctuations in their financial performance are more easily coped with.
*''Complicated Business Processes''. Flexibility and Responsiveness are in jeopardy. Customer complaints, for instance, are difficult to resolve in a straightforward manner. 
*''A Heterogeneous portfolio of small companies, accumulated over time through M&amp;A activities''. The key functions, such as production, R&amp;D, and M&amp;S, are located on different sites, often in different countries.
*''A Cohabitation with Other Units''.
A comprehensive list of about 1400 fine chemical companies (including traders) can be found in the “event catalogue” of the [[CPhI]] exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=CPhI Worldwide, 25-27 October 2011|publisher=Messe Frankfurt, UBM plc., London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''second tier'' consists of several dozens of ''midsized'' companies with sales in the range of $100–$250 million per year. Their portfolios comprise both custom manufacturing and API-for-generics. They include both independents and subsidiaries of major companies. A number of these companies are privately owned and have grown mainly by reinvesting the profits. Examples are [[Bachem]], Switzerland; Dishman, India; [[Fabbrica Italiana Sintetici|F.I.S.]] and [[Poli Industria Chimica]], Italy; [[Hikal]], India, and [[Hovione]], Portugal. Customers prefer to do business with mid-sized companies, because communications are easier —they typically deal directly with the decision maker— and they can better leverage their purchasing power. 
The ''third tier'' includes thousands of ''small independents'' with sales below $100 million per year. Most of them are located in Asia.  They often specialize in niche technologies. The minimum economical size of a fine chemical company depends on the availability of infrastructure. If a company is located in an industrial park, where analytical services; utilities, safety, health, and environmental (SHE) services, and warehousing are readily available, there is practically no lower limit. New fine chemical plants have come on-stream mostly in Far East countries over the past few years. Their annual turnover rate rarely exceeds $25 million.
All big and medium-size fine chemical companies have cGMP-compliant plants that are suitable for the production of pharmaceutical fine chemicals. With the exception of biopharmaceuticals, which are manufactured by only a few selected fine chemical companies, (see section 3.2.2), the technology toolboxes of all these companies are similar. This means that they can carry out practically all types of chemical reactions. They differentiate on the basis of the breadth and quality of the service offering.

===Contract research organizations===
Contract research organizations (CROs) provide services to the life science industries along product development. There are more than 2000 CROs operating worldwide, representing revenues of more than $20 billion. One distinguishes between "Product" and "Patient" CROs. Whereas the production sites of CMOs are multipurpose plants, allowing for the production of tens to hundreds of tons of fine chemicals, the work places of patient CROs are the test persons (volunteers) for the clinical trials and those of the product CROs are the laboratory benches. Major customers for CRO services are the large global pharmaceutical companies. Half a dozen companies ([[Pfizer]], [[GlaxoSmithKline]], [[Sanofi-Aventis]], [[AstraZeneca]], [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], and [[Merck &amp; Co]].) alone absorb about one third of all CRO spending. As for CMOs also for CROs, biotech start-up companies with their dichotomy between ambitious drug development programs and limited resources are the second most promising prospects. Product CROs (chemical CROs) are providing primarily sample preparation, process research and development services. An overlap between the latter and CMOs exists with regard to pilot plants (100&amp;nbsp;kg quantities), which are part of the arsenal of both types of enterprise.
There are more 100 product CROs. Most of them are privately held and have revenues of $10–$20 million per year or less, adding up to a total business in the range of $1.5-$2 billion. Their tasks are described in Chapter 5,
Examples of are:

*In ''North America'': [[Alphora]]; Delmar; NAEJA, all Canada.  [[Albany Molecular Research|AMRI]]; [[Aptuit]]; [[Cambridge Major]]; [[ChemBridge]];  [[Innocentive]]; [[Irix Pharmaceuticals]], [[PharmEco]], all USA.
*In ''Europe''; [[Carbogen-Amcis]], Switzerland; [[Chemcomm]], Germany; [[ChemDiv]], Russia; [[Clauson-Kaas]], Denmark; [[Enamine Ltd]], Ukraine; [[Girindus]], Germany; [[Nerviano Medical Sciences]], Italy; [[Recipharm]], Sweden; [[Serichim]], Italy; [[Solvias]], Switzerland, Netherlands.  
*In ''Asia'': [[BioDuro]], [[Medicilon]], [[Pharmaron]]; [[WuXi AppTec]], all China; [[Acoris (company)|Acoris]]; [[Aptuit Laurus]];  [[Biocon / Syngene]];  [[Chembiotek]]; [[Chempartner]]; [[ProCitius]],  all India;  [[NARD Institute]], [[Riken]], both Japan.
The business of CROs is usually done through a “pay for service” arrangement. Contrary to manufacturing companies, invoicing of CROs is not based on unit product price, but on full-time equivalents (FTEs), that is, the cost of a scientist working one year on a given customer assignment. 
Companies offering both contract research and manufacturing services (CRAMS) combine the activities of CROs and CMOs. Their history is either a forward integration of a CRO, which adds industrial scale capabilities or backwards integration of a CMO. As there are only limited synergies (e.g. &gt; 90% of the projects end at the sample preparation stage). It is questionable, though, whether one-stop shops really fulfil a need. Actually, the large fine chemical companies consider the preparation of samples more as marketing tool (and expense ...) rather than a profit contributor.

The offerings of Patient CROs (Clinical CROs) comprise more than 30 tasks addressing the clinical part of pharmaceutical development at the interface between drugs, physicians, hospitals, and patients, such as the clinical development and selection of lead new drug compounds. As [[clinical trials]] represent the largest expense in pharmaceutical research, the market for patient CROs is larger than for their product counterparts. Thus, the sales of the top tier firms, [[Charles River Laboratories]], [[Covance]], [[Parexel]], [[Pharmaceutical Product Development|PPD]], [[Quintiles Transnational]], all USA, and [[TCG Lifescience]], India; are in the $1–$2 billion range, whereas the largest product CROs have revenues of a few 100 million dollars.

==Research and development==
The overall emphasis of fine chemical R&amp;D is more on development than on research. The main tasks are (1) designing, respectively duplicating and adapting in case of custom manufacture, and developing laboratory procedures for new products or processes; (2) transferring the processes from the laboratory via [[pilot plant]] to the industrial scale (the scale up factor from a 10g sample to a 1-ton batch is 100,000); and (3) to optimize existing processes. At all times during this course of action it has to be ensured that the four critical constraints, namely, economics, timing, safety, ecology and sustainability are observed .
R&amp;D expenditures in the fine chemical industry are higher than in the commodities industry. They represent around 5–10% versus 2–5% of sales. On the business side, product innovation must proceed at a more rapid pace, because life cycles of fine chemicals are shorter than those of commodities. Therefore, there is an ongoing need for substitution of obsolete products. On the technical side, the higher complexity of the products and the more stringent regulatory requirements absorb more resources.
Many economic and technical parameters have been proposed to enable a meaningful assessment of single projects and project portfolios. Examples are attractiveness, strategic fit, innovation, gross/net present value, expected profits, R&amp;D expenditures, development stage, probability of success, technology fit, potential conflicts with other activities of the company and realization time. Most of these parameters cannot be determined quantitatively, at least during the early phases of a project. The best way to take advantage of a project portfolio is to develop and use it in an iterative way. By comparing the entries at regular intervals, for instance, every 3 months, the directions that the projects take can be visualized. If a negative trend persists with one particular project, the project should be put on the watch list.

===Objectives===
R&amp;D has to manage the following functions in order to deliver the requested services:
''[[Literature]] and [[Patent Research]]''. Provisions have to be made for a periodic examination of all acquired research results to safeguard [[Intellectual Property Rights]] (IPR) and to determine whether patent applications are indicated. Patent research is particularly important for evaluation of the feasibility of taking up R&amp;D for new APIs-for-generics.
''[[Process Research]]'' has to design new synthetic routes and sequences. Two approaches are feasible. For simple molecules, the “bottom-up” approach is the method of choice. The researcher converts a commercially available starting material and sequentially adds more reagents until the target molecule is synthesized. For more complex molecules, a “top-down” approach, also known as [[retro synthesis]], or de-construction, is chosen. Key fragments of the target molecule are first identified, then synthesized individually, and finally combined to form the desired molecule through convergent synthesis.
''[[Process Development]]'' focuses on the design of new, efficient, stable, safe, and scalable synthetic routes to a target fine chemical. It represents an essential link between process research and commercial production. The resulting “[[base process]]” description provides the necessary data for the determination of preliminary raw material and [[product specifications]], the manufacture of semi commercial quantities in the pilot plant, the assessment of the ecological impact, the [[regulatory submissions]] and [[technology transfer]] to manufacture at industrial scale, and an estimate of the manufacturing costs in an industrial-scale plant. If the base process is provided by the customer as part of the technology transfer, process, research has to optimize it so that it can be transferred to the bench-scale laboratory or pilot plant. Furthermore, it has to be adapted to the specific characteristics of available production trains. 
''[[Bench-scale Laboratory]], [[kg-lab]] and Pilot Plant Development''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanley H. Nusim|title=Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients: Development, Manufacturing, and Regulation|year=2009|publisher=Taylor&amp;Francis Group, Boca Raton FL|pages=9–91|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the volume requirements, three different types of equipment are used  for process research, development and optimization, namely bench-scale laboratories for gram to 100 gram, kilo-labs for kg to 10&amp;nbsp;kg and pilot plants for 100&amp;nbsp;kg to ton quantities. Particularities of laboratory processes that have to be eliminated include the use of large numbers of [[unit operations]], dilute reaction mixtures, vast quantities of solvents for extraction, evaporation to dryness, drying of solutions with hygroscopic salts. Although modern [[reaction calorimeters]] consent to foresee the effects of these different conditions to a certain extent, a direct transfer of a process from the laboratory to the industrial scale is not recommended, because of the inherent safety, environmental, and economic risks. In development, the viability of the process on a semi commercial scale has to be demonstrated. Trial quantities of the new fine chemical have to be manufactured for market development, clinical tests, and other requirements. The necessary data have to be generated to enable the engineering department to plan the modifications of the industrial-scale plant and in order to calculate production costs for the expected large-volume requirements. Both equipment and plant layout of the pilot plant reflect those of an industrial multipurpose plant, except for the size of reaction vessels (bench-scale laboratory ~10–60 liters; pilot plant ~100–2500 liters) and the degree of process automation. Before the process is ready for transfer to the industrial-scale plant, the following activities have to be completed: Adaptation of the laboratory process to the constraints of a pilot plant, [[hazard and operability]] (HAZOP) analysis, execution of [[demonstration batches]]. The main differences between laboratory synthesis and industrial scale production are shown in Table 4.

In case of cGMP fine chemicals also a [[process validation]] is required. It consists of the three elements [[process design]], [[process qualification]] and [[continued process verification]]. 
''[[Process Optimization]]''.  Once a new chemical process has been introduced successfully on an industrial scale, process optimization is called upon to improve the economics. As a rule of thumb it should be attempted to reduce the [[costs of goods sold]] (COGS) by 10-20%, every time the yearly production quantity has doubled. The task extends from fine tuning the currently used synthetic method all the way to the search for an entirely different second generation process. Specific provisions are the increase of overall yield, the reduction of the number of steps, raw material cost, solvent, catalyst, enzyme consumption, environmental impact.

===Project management===
There are two main sources of new research projects, namely ideas originating from the researchers themselves (“supply push”) and those coming from customers (“demand pull”). Ideas for new processes typically originate from researchers, ideas for new products from customers, respectively customer contacts. Particularly in custom manufacturing, “demand pull” prevails industrial reality. The “new product committee” is the body of choice for evaluating new and monitoring ongoing research activities. It has the assignment to evaluate all new product ideas. It decides whether a new product idea should be taken up in research, reassesses a project at regular intervals and, last but not least decides also about the abandonment of a project, once it becomes evident that the objectives cannot be reached.  In a typical project the overall responsibility for the economic and technical success lies with the [[project champion]]. He is assisted by the [[project manager]], who is responsible for the technical success. In custom manufacturing, a typical project starts with the acceptance of the product idea, which originates mainly from business development, by the new product committee, followed by the preparation of a laboratory process, and ends with the successful completion of demonstration runs on industrial scale and the signature of a multiyear supply contract, respectively. The input from the customer is contained in the “[[technology package]]”.  Its main constituents are (1) reaction scheme, (2) target of project &amp; deliverables (product, quantity, required dates, specifications), (3) list of [[analytical methods]], (4) process development opportunities (stepwise assessment), (5) list of required reports, (6) [[Safety, Health and Environment]] (SHE) issues, (7) materials to be supplied by customer and (8) packaging &amp; shipping information The technical part of a project usually determines its duration. Depending on the quality of the information contained in the “technology package” received from the customer and the complexity of the project as such, particularly the number of steps that have to be performed; it can be any time between 12 and 24 months. Depending on the number of researches involved, the total budget easily amounts to several million US dollars.

==Markets==
Fine chemicals are used as starting materials for specialty chemicals. The latter are obtained either by direct formulation or after chemical/biochemical transformation of intermediates to active substances. Life sciences, primarily pharmaceutical, agrochemical and food and feed industries are the main consumers of fine chemicals.

===Market size===
Fine chemicals account for about 4% of the universe of chemicals. The latter, valued at $2,500 billion, is dominated mainly by oil-, gas-, and mineral-derived commodities (~40%) on one hand and a large variety of specialty chemicals at the interface between industry and the public on the other hand (~55%). The global production value of fine chemicals is estimated at $85 billion, of which about 2/3, or $55 billion are produced captively and $30 billion represent the global revenues of the fine chemical industry. The corresponding figures for the major user, the pharmaceutical industry, are $32 billion and $23 billion, respectively. For a number of reasons, such as the lack of statistical data and the somewhat equivocal definition it is not possible to exactly determine the size of the fine chemical market.

In Table 5, the approximately $85 billion fine chemical market is subdivided into major applications according to their relevance, namely,  fine chemicals for pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialty chemicals outside life sciences. Furthermore, a distinction is made between captive (in-house) production and merchant market. Pharmaceutical fine chemicals (PFCs) account for two-thirds of the total. Out of the PFC value of $55 billion, about $23 billion (~40%) are traded, and $32 billion (~60%) are the production value of the pharma industry’s in-house production. Within life science products, fine chemicals for agro, and —at a distance— for veterinary drugs follow in importance. The production value for fine chemicals used for specialty chemicals other than pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals is estimated at $15 billion. As the leading specialty chemical companies, [[Akzo Nobel]], [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow]], [[Du Pont]], [[Evonik]], [[Chemtura]] and [[Mitsubishi]] are backward-integrated, the share of in-house production is estimated at 75%, leaving a merchant market of approximately $5 billion.

===Target markets===

====Pharmaceuticals====
The pharmaceutical industry constitutes the most important customer base for the fine chemical industry (see Table 4). The largest companies are [[Pfizer]], USA; [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]], Switzerland, [[GlaxoSmithKline]], UK; [[Sanofi Aventis]], France, and [[Novartis]], Switzerland. All are active in R&amp;D, manufacturing and marketing. Pharmaceuticals containing more than 2000 different active ingredients are in commerce today; a sizable number of them are sourced from the fine chemical industry. The industry also has a track record of above-average growth. 
The fine chemical industry has a keen interest in the top-selling or “[[blockbuster drugs]]”, i.e. those with worldwide annual sales in excess of $1 billion. Their number has increased steadily, from 27 in 1999 to 51 in 2001, 76 in 2003, and then levelled off.

Sales of the top 20 blockbuster drugs are reported in Table 6. The APIs of 12 of them are “small” (LMW) molecules. Averaging a MW of 477, they have quite complex structures. They typically show three cyclic moieties. 10 of them exhibit at least one N-heterocyclic moiety. Five of the top 10, up from none in 2005, are biopharmaceuticals. The largest-selling non-proprietary drugs are [[paracetamol]], [[omeprazole]], [[ethinylestradiol]], [[amoxicillin]], [[pyridoxine]], and [[ascorbic acid]].
The innovator pharma companies require mainly custom manufacturing services for their proprietary drug substances. The demand is driven primarily by the number of new drug launches, the volume requirements and the industry’s “make or buy” strategy. A summary of the pro’s and con’s for outsourcing from the pharma industry’s perspective is given in Table 7. As extended studies at the Stern Business School of the New York City University have shown, financial considerations clearly favor the “buy” option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.

[[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]] and [[Sandoz]] are by far the largest ''generics companies'' (see also chapter 6.3.2). They differ from their competitors not only in sales revenues but also because they are strongly backwards integrated and have proprietary drugs in their portfolios. They also vie for the promising biosimilars market.

Several thousand ''smal''l or ''virtual pharma'' companies focus on R&amp;D. albeit on just a few lead compounds. They typically originate mostly from academia. Therefore, their R&amp;D strategy is more focused on the elucidation of the biological roots of diseases rather than developing synthesis methods.

====Agrochemicals====
Agrochemical companies are the second largest users of fine chemicals. Most products have a “pharmaceutical heritage”. As a consequence of an intensive M&amp;A activity over the past 10–20 years, the industry now is more consolidated than the pharmaceutical industry. The top 10 companies, led by [[Syngenta]], Switzerland; [[Bayer Cropsciences]], Germany: [[Monsanto]], USA; [[BASF Crop Protection]], Germany, and [[Dow Agrosciences]], USA have a share of almost 95% of the total 2,000,000 tons / $48.5 billion pesticide output in 2010. Since the 1990s the R&amp;D effort is focused mainly on [[genetically modified crops|gene modified (GM) seeds]]. At both Monsanto and DuPont’s seed subsidiary, [[Pioneer Hi-Bred]], GM seed businesses already account for more than 50% of total sales. 100 new LMW agrochemicals have been launched in the period 2000–2009. However, only 8 products achieved sales in excess of $100 million per year.

Generics play a bigger role in the agro than in the pharma industry. They represent some 70% of the global market. [[China National Chemical Corp]], a.k.a. ChemChina Group, is the world's largest supplier of generic farm chemicals. [[Mahkteshim Agan]], Israel, and [[Cheminova]], Denmark follow on the ranks 2 and 3. Apart from these multibillion-dollar companies, there are hundreds of smaller firms with sales of less than $50 million per year, mainly in India and China. The incidence of the cost of the active ingredient is about 33%; i.e., much higher than in drugs. Depending on the climatic conditions affecting crop yields, consumption and prices of agrochemicals are subject to wide fluctuations from year to year, impacting also the suppliers.

The molecular structures of modern agrochemicals are much more complex than in older products, but lower than of their pharma counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=C.D.S. Tomlin|title=The Pesticide Manual: A World Compendium|year=2011|publisher=BCPC Publications, Alton, Hampshire, UK|edition=15th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average molecular weight of the top 10 is 330, as compared with 477 for the top 10.  In comparison to reagents used in pharmaceutical fine chemical syntheses, hazardous chemicals, e.g. [[sodium azide]], [[halogens]], [[Dimethyl sulfide|methyl sulfide]], [[phosgene]], [[phosphorus chlorides]], are more frequently used. Agrochemical companies sometimes outsource just these steps, which require specialized equipment, on toll conversion deals. With exception of the [[pyrethroids]], which are photostable modifications of naturally occurring pyrethrums, active ingredients of agrochemicals rarely are chiral. Examples within ''[[herbicides]]'' are the world’s longstanding top-selling product, Monsanto’s [[roundup (herbicide)|round-up]] (glyphosate). Syngenta’s cyclohexadione-type [[mesotrione]] and [[paraquat dichloride]].  Within ''[[insecticides]]'', the traditional [[organophosphates]], like [[malathion]], and pyrethroids such as [[Cyhalothrin|γ-cyhalotrin]] are being substituted for by [[neonicotinoids]], like Bayer’s [[imidacloprid]] and Syngenta’s [[thiamethoxam]]  and pyrazoles, such as BASF’s [[fipronil]]. [[Chloranthaniliprole]] is the most important representative of Du Pont’s award-winning anthranilic diamide family of broad spectrum insecticides. Within ''[[fungicides]]'', the [[strobilurins]], a new class, are growing rapidly and already have captured more than 30% of the $10 billion global fungicide market. Syngenta’s [[azoxystrobin]] was the first product launched. Also BASF’s [[F-500]] Series, a.o. [[pyraclostrobin]] and [[kresoxim-methyl]], Bayer CropScience, and Monsanto are developing new compounds in this class. Combination pesticides, such as Monsanto’s [[Genuity (Monsanto brand)|Genuity]] and [[SmartStax]] are more and more frequently used.

====Other specialty chemical industries====
Apart from life sciences, specialty chemicals -and therefore also their active ingredients, commodities or fine chemicals, as the case may be- are used ubiquitously, in both industrial applications, such as [[biocides]] and [[corrosion inhibitors]] in cooling water towers, and consumer applications, such as [[personal care]] and household products. The active ingredients extend from high-price / low-volume fine chemicals, used for [[liquid crystal displays]] to large-volume / low-price amino acids used as [[feed additives]].

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;fine chemicals merchant  market size, growth potential

Examples of applications in eight areas, ranging from [[adhesives]] to [[specialty polymers]], are listed in Table 8.  Overall, the attractiveness for the fine chemical industry is smaller than the life science industry. The total market, expressed in finished product sales, amounts to $150–200 billion, or about one fourth of the pharma market. The embedded fine chemicals account for an estimated $15 billion (see Table 5). Further disadvantages are the backward integration of the big players, e.g.  [[Akzo-Nobel]], Netherlands; [[Ajinomoto]], Japan; [[Danone]], France; [[Everlight Chemical Industrial Corp.]], Taiwan; [[Evonik-Degussa]], Germany; [[Givaudan]] and [[Nestlé]], Switzerland, [[Novozymes]], Denmark, [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], and [[Unilever]] USA. Last but not least, innovation  is rather based on new formulations of existing products, rather than the development of new fine chemicals. It is most likely to happen in application areas unrelated to human health (where NCEs are subject to very extensive testing).

===Target products and services===
Global sales of proprietary drugs are estimated $735 billion in 2010, or almost 90% of the total pharma market. Global sales of generics are about $100 billion, or just over 10% of the total pharma market. Due to the much lower unit price, their market share will be close to 30% on an API volume/volume basis.

====Custom manufacturing====
The products and services offered by the fine chemical industry fall into two broad categories: (1) “Exclusives”, a.k.a. custom manufacturing (CM) and (2) “standard” or “catalogue” products.  “Exclusives”, provided mostly under contract research or [[custom manufacturing]] arrangements, prevail in business with life science companies; “standards” prevail in other target markets. Service-intense custom manufacturing (CM) constitutes the most prominent activity of the fine chemical industry. CM is the antonym of [[outsourcing]]. In custom manufacturing, a specialty-chemicals company outsources the process development, pilot plant, and, finally, industrial-scale production of an active ingredient, or a predecessor thereof, to one, or a few, fine chemical companies. The intellectual property of the product, and generally also the manufacturing process, stay with the customer. The customer-supplier relationship is governed by an exclusive supply agreement. At the beginning of cooperation, the customer provides a “tech package,” which in its simplest version, includes a laboratory synthesis description and SHE recommendations. In this case, the whole scale up, which comprises a factor of about one million (10 gram → 10 ton quantities), is done by the fine chemical company.

====Standard products====
Non-exclusives, ”standard” or “catalogue products” constitute the second most important outlet for fine chemicals after custom manufacturing. [[API-for-Generics]] are the most important sub-category. Because of [[patent expiries]], &gt;60 “top 200 drugs” alone, representing aggregated sales of $140 billion, are expected to fall into the public domain within by 2015.and government incentives, global sales of generics are increasing rapidly.
Asian companies dominate the API-for-Generics business. They have the triple advantage of their low cost basis, their big home markets, and previous manufacturing experience in producing for their domestic and other non-regulated markets.

==Financials==

===Investment costs===
Investment costs for multipurpose plants are high in comparison with product output. However, they vary considerably, depending on the location, size of equipment and degree of sophistication (e.g., automation, containment, quality of equipment, complexity of infrastructure).  An example for a cGMP multipurpose plant built in the US is shown in Table 9. The investment cost of $21 million comprises just the equipment and installation. The building, property and external services are excluded. For comparison purposes, the investment cost per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; reactor volume is used. In this case, it is $0.9 million. The amount includes the cost of the reaction vessel itself plus an equitable part of the ancillary equipment, like feeding tanks, piping, pumps &amp; process control. If larger or smaller reactors were installed, the unit cost per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; would decrease or decrease with the exponent 0.5, respectively. Hence, by increasing the equipment size manufacturing costs on a per kilogram (kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) basis typically decrease substantially. Also, costs for a plant that is used for the production of non regulated intermediates only would be substantially lower. Pharma companies tend to spend up to ten times more for a plant with the same capacity. In contrast, investment costs in developing countries, particularly in India or China, are considerably lower.

===Manufacturing costs===
The raw material consumption and the [[conversion cost]] are the two elements that establish the manufacturing cost for a particular fine chemical. The former is determined primarily by the unit consumption and the purchasing cost of the materials used; the latter, by the throughput in kilograms per day in a given production bay. A precise calculation of the conversion cost is a demanding task. Different products with widely differing throughputs are produced in campaigns in multipurpose plants, occupying the equipment to different extents. Therefore, both the production capacity and the equipment utilization for a specific fine chemical are difficult to determine. Moreover, cost elements such as labor, capital, utilities, maintenance, waste disposal, and quality control cannot be allocated unambiguously.

An approximative calculation can be done by an experienced process development or pilot plant chemist on the basis of (1) the laboratory synthesis procedure and  (2) by breaking down the process into unit operations, the standard costs of which have been determined previously Controlling has to be involved for a more in-depth costing.. The problems it has to address are how to fairly allocate costs for production capacity, which is not used. This can be due to the fact that part of a production bay is idle, because of lack of demand or because e.g., a reactor is not required for a particular process.

Manufacturing costs usually are reported on a per kilogram product basis. For the purpose of benchmarking (both internal and external), the volume x time / output (VTO), as mentioned above, is a useful aid.

An indicative cost structure for a fine chemical company is shown in Table 10. Nowadays, a full 7-day/week operation, consisting of four or five shift teams, each working 8h per day, has become the standard. In terms of production costs, this is the most advantageous scheme. Higher salaries for night work are more than offset by better fixed cost absorption. As part of the budgeting process, standard costs for a production campaign of a particular fine chemical are determined on the basis of past experience. The actual results of the campaign are then compared with the standard. The capability of a fine chemical company to make dependable manufacturing cost forecasts is a distinct competitive advantage.

===Profitability===
The fine chemical industry has undergone several boom and bust phases during its almost 30 years of existence. The biggest boom took place in the late 1990s, when high-dosage, high volume anti-AIDS drugs and COX-2 inhibitors gave a big boost to custom manufacturing. After the end of the “irrational exuberance” in 2000, the industry suffered a first bust in 2003, as a result of capacity expansions, the advent of Asian competitors and a ruinous M&amp;A activity, several billion dollars of shareholder value were destroyed. The most recent –minor- boom is associated with stockpiling of GlaxoSmithKline’s [[Relenza]] (zanamivir) and Roche’s [[Tamiflu]] (oseltamivir phosphate) by many countries in order to prepare for a possible avian flu epidemic. Surprisingly, the main cause for the 2009 slump had not been the general recession, but slow-downs of the growth and, even more so, inventory adjustments by the pharma industry. They resulted in postponements or cancellations of orders. The unfavorable development was in sharp contrast to the very optimistic growth forecasts, which many fine chemical companies, had announced. They had been based on equally promising sector reports from investment banks, which in turn had evolved from forward projections of the preceding boom period. In most cases, these projections have been missed by a large margin. 
 
At the end of the “irrational exuberance” at the turn of the millennium and again in 2009 almost half of the industry achieved a return on sales (ROS) of more than 10%, and less than 10% an ROS below 5%.  In the worst years, 2003 and 2009, almost half of the companies suffered from an ROS of less than 5%. Whereas during the period under review, 2000–2009. the average EBITDA / sales and EBIT / sales ratios of representative companies, resp. divisions were 15% and 7½%, respectively, in the period 2000–2009, the numbers were 20% and 10–13% in the boom, and 10% and 5% in the bust phases. The factor 2 between the high and low numbers reflects the volatility of the industry’s profitability. All in all, the average Western fine-chemical firms have been making a return below the cost of capital, i.e. they are not reinvestment grade.

==Outlook==
Two main trends impinge on the industry. On the ''supply side'', biotechnology is rapidly gaining importance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} In the synthesis of small molecule fine chemicals, the use of biocatalysts and microbial fermentation enable both a more sustainable and economic production than conventional organic chemistry. In the synthesis of big molecules, such as biopharmaceuticals, it is the method of choice. Biopharmaceuticals are expected to grow 15% per year, three times as fast as small molecule drugs. Five of the top ten drugs were biopharmaceuticals in 2010 (see table 6), and this is expected to grow to eight by 2016 (see table 2).

On the ''demand side'', the main customer base for fine chemicals, the pharmaceutical industry, is faced with slower growth of demand, patent expirations of many lucrative blockbuster drugs and stalling new product launches. In order to restrain these challenges, the leading companies are implementing restructuring programs. They comprise a reduction of in-house chemical manufacturing and plant eliminations. Outsourcing is moving up from a purely opportunistic to a strategic approach. It is difficult to make a judgment, whether the positive or negative effects of these initiatives will prevail. In a worst-case scenario, a condition could develop, whereby even top-tier mid-sized, family-owned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guy Villax|title=Family owned businesses|journal=Chimica Oggi / chemistry today|date=Nov–Dec 2008|volume=26|issue=6|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; fine-chemical companies with state-of-the-art plants and processes could be relegated to producing small quantities of fine chemicals for new life-science products in late stage of development. In agro fine chemicals, the active ingredients become more sophisticated and performing. Therefore, they require multipurpose instead of dedicated plants prevailing in the industry so far. At the same token, outsourcing is gaining ground.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}
 
''Globalization'' results in a shift of fine chemical production from the industrialized to developing countries. The latter benefit not only from a “low cost / high skill” advantage, but also from a rapidly rising domestic demand for Western medicine. Despite the mantras of Western industry leaders, the cost advantage of the Asian producers is going to persist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=P. Pollak |author2=A. Badrot |author3=R. Dach |author4=A. Swadi |title=Costs of Asian Fine Chemical Producers close-up to European Levels – Facts or Fiction?|publisher=Contract Pharma|date=Nov–Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the pharmemerging countries mainly use generics, their market share continues to grow to the detriment of originator pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. This is also the case for biosimilars, the generic versions of biopharmaceuticals. 
As a consequence of the harsh business climate, many Western fine chemical companies or divisions created during the “irrational exuberance” at the end of the 20th century already have exited from the sector.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Others will follow suit or will be acquired by private equity firms. Survival strategies include implementation of lean production principles originally developed by the automotive industry and extending the business model to include also contract research at the beginning and active drug formulation towards the end of the added value chain. This latter strategy, however, is not finding unanimous approval by industry experts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Although the demand for fine chemicals on the merchant market has not grown to the extent originally anticipated, fine chemicals still provide attractive opportunities for well-run companies, which are fostering the critical success factors, namely running fine chemicals as a core business, pursuing niche technologies—primarily biotechnology—and taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the Asian market.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

'''George Speight''' (['speːt]; born 1957{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}), occasionally known as '''Ilikini Naitini''', is a [[Fiji]]an businessman. He was the leader of the [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|Fiji coup of 2000]], in which he and an elite unit of Fiji's military detained thirty-six members of parliament and held them hostage from May 19, 2000 to July 13, 2000. He is serving [[life imprisonment]] for his role in the coup.

== Fiji coup of 2000 ==

{{main|2000 Fijian coup d'état}}

On May 19, 2000, a disparate gang led by Speight stormed the [[Parliament of Fiji|parliamentary]] complex and kidnapped [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]] [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] and 35 other parliamentarians for the i Taukei (indigenous) rights, including several [[Cabinet of Fiji|cabinet ministers]]. Announcing that he had deposed both the government and the President, Speight swore in serving ruling government member Timoci Silatolu as [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]], and proclaimed [[Jope Seniloli]] president in place of [[Kamisese Mara]]. Seniloli has since been convicted of [[treason]] for aiding and abetting the coup. President Mara tried to resist Speight's takeover, but was abruptly removed himself on 29 May by [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]], the Commander of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military]] who subsequently abrogated the constitution, made himself Prime Minister and swore in his own President, Ratu Epeli Nailatikau (Ratu Jope Seniloli's cousin).

The overthrow of the government saw support for Speight's cause as outbreaks of violence occurred in [[Suva]], [[Levuka]], Naitasiri, Tailevu, Ra, Nadi, Yasawa, Serua, Namosi, and on July 7 an army base on [[Vanua Levu]] Island was overrun by his supporters.

Fifteen soldiers and two of their officers defected to the rebels and George Speight built up a strong private army. On June 9, Speight announced that he had abolished Fiji's multi-racial [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|Constitution]]. Three days later, Speight's car was sprayed with gunfire, but the army denied that soldiers were involved in an operation to kill him. On June 25, four female hostages were released. On July 13, Chaudhry was released following an agreement between the rebels and the military administration of Commodore Bainimarama. Claiming that he had signed the agreement "under duress," Bainimarama promptly rescinded it. On 27 July, Speight was arrested with 369 of his followers and charged with treason.

== Motives for the coup ==

Speight claimed to be a Fijian nationalist and a champion of indigenous rights. He attracted support from elements of the Fijian population who were angered by the results of the 1999 [[Fijian general election, 1999|election]], which had swept away a government dominated by [[Fijians|ethnic Fijians]] and brought to power a [[multiracial]] government led by Mahendra Chaudhry, who became Fiji's first-ever [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijian]] Prime Minister. Hints that the Chaudhry government might institute some form of [[land reform]] also generated considerable resentment among sections of the indigenous population, despite [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|constitutional]] guarantees that ethnic Fijian ownership of 83 percent of the land could not be changed without the support of 9 of the 14 [[Senate of Fiji|senators]] appointed by the [[Great Council of Chiefs]], a wholly indigenous body. The lead-up to the coup had seen politicians and other public figures play upon this resentment and foster public fear that native land might be alienated. Speight thus found a sizeable number of sympathizers when he launched the coup on 19 May.

Speight's partner, [[Torika Rawlinson]], told the student newspaper Wansolwara that the original intention had been to execute members of the deposed government the night before the coup actually took place. She denied others' reports that Indo-Fijian businessmen had been involved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051109051946/http://www.usp.ac.fj/journ/docs/wansol/7102/7102torika.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elected to and expelled from Parliament ==

In August 2001, democracy was restored and in [[Fijian general election, 2001|the subsequent election]] Speight was elected to the [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]] using the name of Ilikimi Naitini. He was elected as a Representative for the [[Tailevu North (Fijian Communal Constituency, Fiji)|Tailevu North Fijian Communal]] constituency as a candidate of the [[Conservative Alliance-Matanitu Vanua|Conservative Alliance Matanitu Vanua Party]] despite his confinement on Nukulau Island. Speight was prevented by the speaker of the Fiji parliament, [[Epeli Nailatikau]], from taking up his seat in Parliament. That December he was expelled from Parliament for non-attendance.

==Sentence ==
On 18 February 2002, Speight was sentenced to death after pleading guilty to a charge of [[treason]]. However, the government of the Prime Minister [[Laisenia Qarase]] had abolished the death sentence in the House of Representatives on the day that Speight was sentenced. [[President of Fiji|President]] [[Josefa Iloilo]], who had replaced Mara following the coup, followed the advice of the Prime Minister and commuted Speight's sentence to [[life imprisonment]]. Speight started serving his sentence on [[Nukulau|Nukulau Island]] where he had been living in exile. Following the decision of the military government to close the Nukulau facility, Speight was transferred on 20 December 2006. He is currently serving his sentence at the Naboro Maximum Security Prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=53891 | title=Speight off Nukulau, now in Naboro | date=21 December 2006 | agency=[[The Fiji Times]] | accessdate=6 August 2013 | location=Suva, Fiji}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purported change of heart ==
On 15 September 2004, a source close to the Fijian government revealed that Speight had renewed his faith in [[Christianity]] during his imprisonment. {{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} According to the source, Speight's faith had led to a change of heart towards the Indo-Fijian community, and that he wished to participate in the upcoming [[Fiji Week, 2004|Fiji Week]], a series of prayer meetings and multicultural programmes aimed at reconciling Fiji's ethnic communities, planned for the week of 4 October through 11 October. "He now feels inspired by the word of God and would like to take part in the week of reconciliation," the source told the [[Australian Associated Press]].{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} This request for permission to leave his island prison to take part in the observances was refused, however. A spokesman for deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry said that he would be prepared to meet with Speight in principle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaudhry calls on Speight to come clean|url=http://pidp.eastwestcenter.org/pireport/2004/October/10-12-06.htm|website=Pacific Islands Report|publisher=Fiji Sun|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash;provided that he reveal the identities of the persons who had planned and financed the coup.

The [[Fiji Village]] news service reported on 29 January 2006 that Speight and his associates had indicated his willingness to face the government's proposed [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill|Reconciliation and Unity Commission]] and reveal what they knew about the planning, financing, and execution of the coup. This was an apparent reversal of his earlier vow to remain silent.

''Fiji Live'' quoted Speight as alleging that the real reason for the strident opposition of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|military]] to the legislation establishing the proposed Commission was that their and, in particular, Bainimarama's own role in the coup plot would be in danger of being revealed. The latest information revealed by some of the CRW troops arrested with Speight suggest that Bainimarama may have been the real coup leader after giving the go-ahead at the last security council meeting on Friday May 12, 2000 at Valelevu. Bainimara's subsequent departure for Norway ensured that he was free from coup conspiracy. On his return not long after the takeover he sent a delegation made up of military spokesmen Colonel Filipo Tarakinikini, Colonel [[Etueni Caucau]] and acting Commander Colonel Tuatoko to express his full support for Speight and ex SAS Warrant Officer, Ilisoni Ligairi. Both men were unaware of the pre-coup arrangements set up by Bainimarama. A dispute arose, though, as to who should be in the caretaker government as Bainimarama expected to run the country with a few of his close advisers such as Colonel Jerry Waqanisau, Colonel Kacisolomoni, Colonel Paul Manueli and others. This conflict led to a 56-day rule by Bainimarama after which he was forced to step down by Speight and to return the office of the Presidency to civilian rule. Inside sources allege that Bainimarama manipulated his oblivious officers to finally achieve his pre-May 19, 2000 objectives of ruling the country. {{fact|date=August 2018}}

The [[University of the South Pacific]] journalism school in [[Fiji]] provided coverage of the upheaval on its website [[Pacific Journalism Online]] and newspaper [[Wansolwara]] until its website was temporarily shut down on May 29 during the martial law period. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiapac.org.fj/PJR/issues/next/2001frontline.html][https://web.archive.org/web/20060503012846/http://journalism.uts.edu.au/archive/fiji_coup/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The students' coverage archive is at the [[University of Technology, Sydney]], Australia. &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060425084156/http://journalism.uts.edu.au/archive/coup.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
George Speight hails from [[Naivicula]], about ten kilometers from [[Korovou]] in [[Tailevu Province]]. He is the son of [[Sam Speight]] (sometimes known as Savenaca Tokainavo), a prosperous farmer of [[Fijians|ethnic Fijian]] and European descent. The elder Speight is a war veteran who served in the successful Malayan campaign.{{clarify|date=August 2018}} He subsequently served as a backbencher in Rabuka's governments throughout the 1990s. By the time his son attempted his coup in 2000, however, Sam Speight was an opposition member of [[Parliament of Fiji|Parliament]], his [[Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei]] having lost power to the Indo-Fijian-led [[Fiji Labour Party|Labour Party]] of [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] in the [[Fijian general election, 1999|elections]] of 1999.

Speight has a son, Ely (born 1998) with Torika Rawlinson.

Speight graduated with [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]] and [[Master's degree|Master's]] degrees in [[Business]] from [[Michigan]]'s [[Andrews University]]. He subsequently settled in [[Australia]], where he worked as a sales representative for the Computer Orchard, a Brisbane-based Apple [[Computer]] dealer, and later as a branch manager for Metway Bank before returning to Fiji in 1996. He then became chairman of [[Fiji Pine, Ltd.]] and of [[Fiji Hardwood Corporation, Ltd.]]. He also became a manager of [[Heath Fiji, Ltd.]] but resigned due to shareholder personality conflicts.

The Gold Coast [[central business district]] (CBD) is the planned main commercial centre of the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. The area encompasses an eastern portion of the [[Southport, Queensland|Southport]] suburb. Its north–south axis runs from [[North Street, Gold Coast|North Street]] in the north to Brighton Parade in the south. Its east–west axis runs from [[Gold Coast Broadwater|Broadwater]] in the east to the [[High Street, Gold Coast|High Street]] in the west.

==History==
{{further|History of Gold Coast, Queensland}}
Archaeological evidence suggests [[Indigenous Australians]] inhabited the area for more than ten thousand years before European settlement. The Indigenous tribe that lived in the area were known as the [[Kombumerri Clan|Kombumerri people]] and spoke the [[Yugambeh dialect|Yugambeh language]]. The Kombumerri people named the area Goo-een.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The early settlement of the Logan and Albert districts|url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/data/UQ_207601/s18378366_1935_2_5_208.pdf?Expires=1511243814&amp;Signature=g~6A2FH2gmsAaQvJEtu6DdXMmvRKZmqAziLf699dqoea5JOB48zUR-LXhLFRMDeVVCs3bsZhxiIN6klrYVRoc2Db3mNKyLEoKiIpeuyVbQVJrFQ2QUCaEH5hKoFv86SGu1~u8Z2124740~8O7dLfKd8cpk5OtPO5Nj4AbdB3AjBTHPmmLH3r8Oh7OEONQURpbrKokmGq~bbN4X0Vwv4cAYzmI8Mv0FbFnF87MhBkq-Ag5MMZXoFjuidPWRpZrBic6HIAdxopeRMlb-G7Ksrqgz-AAeDkYXsqDndgjvKLBP0knU77MHCPQFoQqWFS5KXAx0-gy1LoJxZ42r8WZinM9Q__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJKNBJ4MJBJNC6NLQ|publication-date=November 1935|author1=Hanlon, W. E|journal=Journal of the Historical Society of Queensland|volume=2|issue=5|pages=208–262|issn=1837-8366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, Richard Gardiner became the first European to settle in the area, which was known as Nerang Creek Heads at the time. Gardiner built a house and wharf on the river end of Queen Street which later led to the Loder family and several others following his lead and building in the area. The settlement was surveyed in 1874 and the area was renamed [[Town of Southport|Southport]] because it was the southernmost port of the colony of Queensland and took inspiration from the [[Southport|English seaside town]]. In 1877 [[Germans|German]] immigrant [[Johan Meyer]] acquired James Beattie's land at [[Narrow Neck, Queensland|Narrow Neck]] and started a private [[ferry]] service that transported Southport residents to the beachside area that was named [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland|Elston]] shortly after. Meyer's Ferry operated just south of Queen Street on [[Ferry Road, Gold Coast|Meyer's Ferry Road]] and would take travelers across the [[Nerang River]] to [[Cavill Avenue|Elston's Meyer's Ferry Road]]. In 1878 Richard Gardner opened the Southport Hotel, the town's first pub.

[[File:Southport Pier 1910 Photographer unknown.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The [[Southport Pier, Gold Coast|Southport Pier]] in 1910.]]

On 28 November 1883 the [[Southport Pier, Gold Coast|Southport Pier]] was opened in the sheltered [[Gold Coast Broadwater|Broadwater]]. The newly created pier allowed steamboats to unload cargo and passengers. As a result, the coastal area of Southport gained the reputation of being a fashionable seaside resort for [[Brisbane]]'s wealthy and influential but was only accessible by boat for the most part. In 1885 then [[Governor of Queensland]] [[Anthony Musgrave]] built a seaside house in Southport, further affirming the town's reputation as a destination for Queensland's wealthy and influential. A railway extension to the Southport township opened in 1889 and numerous hotels were soon established along the coastline. In 1901 the residents of Southport celebrated [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] and had grown to a permanent population of 1230. In 1922 the [[Government of Queensland|Queensland State Government]] purchased a Nerang Street site for £1737 and opened the [[Gold Coast Hospital]] shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/special-features/years-our-top-news-moments-101/story-fnpon9hl-1227543911971 130 years: Our top news moments 101]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November 1925, the township of Southport had existed for 50 years. The day was declared a public holiday as the town began jubilee celebrations. The first event of the day saw the [[Governor of Queensland#List of Lieutenant-Governors of Queensland|Queensland Lieutenant-Governor]] [[William Lennon]] officially open the [[Jubilee Bridge, Southport|Jubilee Bridge]] which extended from Queen Street, Southport to Main Beach Parade, [[Main Beach, Queensland|Main Beach]].&lt;ref name=geo&gt;{{cite web|title=Jubilee Bridge (South Side)|url=http://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC49R52_jubilee-bridge-south-side?guid=d42e50f7-e2ae-4e02-b23d-45a73b13cd4a|website=Geocaching|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge provided easy access to a beach for Southport residents and the connecting suburb was consequently named Main Beach.

The [[Southport Town Hall, Queensland|Southport Town Hall]] was constructed in 1935 on the corner of Davenport and Nerang Streets by the [[Town of Southport|Southport Town Council]]. On 9 December 1948, a major reorganisation of local government in [[South East Queensland]] saw the towns of Southport and [[Town of Coolangatta|Coolangatta]] amalgamate to create the [[Town of South Coast]]. Most locals felt the new name did not represent the area well and pushed for a change. The town was nicknamed ''Gold Coast'' in the 1950s and on 23 October 1958 the Town of South Coast officially changed its name to [[Town of Gold Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite QSA Agency|2476|Gold Coast Town Council|9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May 1959 it became [[City of Gold Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite QSA Agency|10379|Gold Coast Town Council|9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the city had experienced several name changes and extending of boundaries by the 1960s, Southport was still considered to be the major hub for businesses on the Gold Coast.

===CBD status recognition===
The CBD area was officially declared a priority development area on 4 October 2013 by the Queensland Minister for Economic Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2013/10/4/southport-declared-a-priority-development-area|title=Southport declared a Priority Development Area|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the announcement, many high rises began springing up inside the CBD boundaries as the revitalisation of the area began to take shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/realestate/tale-of-new-city-revival-of-gold-coasts-oldest-suburb-southport/news-story/bcc15277e52ba3417da0eee778716895|title=Tale of new city: Southport revival|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-2014, Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate claimed that Southport had always been the traditional central business district of the Gold Coast and believed more than 15% of Gold Coast residents would work inside the CBD boundaries in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/gold-coast-city-plan-provides-for-southport-cbd-20140617-zsaz6.html Gold Coast City Plan provides for Southport CBD]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revitalisation===
In July 2015, Gold Coast City Council figures showed $2.5 billion of developments had been submitted towards the revitalisation of the CBD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/new-city-council-figures-show-southport-is-at-the-centre-of-a-25-billion-development-boom/story-fnj94hf2-1227464536128|title=City’s $2.5 billion building boom|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recently completed [[Sundale Apartments|Sundale Tower]] is the tallest building in the CBD at 55-stories. A 104-storey tower known as Imperial City has been proposed inside the CBD boundaries but is yet to be approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/gold-coast/proposed-104-storey-southport-tower-poised-to-steal-q1s-crown-of-southern-hemispheres-tallest-residential-high-rise/story-fnj94idh-1226952671929|title=Is the Gold Coast ready for Q2?|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tower would be the tallest residential building in the southern hemisphere should it be approved.

In August 2017, it was revealed Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate had submitted a proposal to the Queensland Government to allow a tender process to build a casino resort on a seven hectare CBD site on the corners of Queen and Scarborough Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-18/gold-coast-southport-casino-under-consideration-following-spit/8819058|title=Second casino under consideration for Gold Coast|date=18 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2017, City of Gold Coast announced a new CBD Program that aimed to revitalise the area by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cbd.wearegoldcoast.com.au/southport-projects/cbd-program-2025/|title=CBD Program 2025 - Gold Coast CBD|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The Gold Coast CBD is located in an eastern portion of the suburb of Southport. It is bordered by High Street to the west and extends as far north as North Street. To the east it is bordered by the Broadwater and extends as far south as Brighton Parade. Nerang Street is considered to be the [[Main Street]] or the primary business street of the CBD.
[[Image:Southport Town Hall, Southport, Queensland.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Town Hall on Nerang Street in 2015.]]

==Governance==
Administratively, the Gold Coast CBD falls under the authority of the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of [[City of Gold Coast]]. The [[Mayor of the Gold Coast]] is based at the [[Southport Town Hall, Queensland|Southport Town Hall]] along Nerang Street inside the CBD boundaries. The [[Government of Queensland|Queensland state government]] also has authority over some aspects of the CBD. Hinze Street is considered the legal district of the CBD as it houses the [[Southport Courthouse]], the Southport Police Station and the Southport Watch House as well as the city's official legal aid office.

==Culture==
===Broadwater Parklands===
[[Image:Southbank Broadwater Parklands, Southport, Queensland.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Broadwater Parklands in 2015.]]
In November 1928 the [[Southport Broadwater Parklands|Parklands]] along the [[Gold Coast Broadwater|Southport Broadwater]] were declared public space. The area featured public baths and a pier at the time but most aspects were eventually removed. The addition of the [[Gold Coast Aquatic Centre|Southport Pool]] in the 1960s further drew visitors to the area. The [[Queensland Government]] and [[City of Gold Coast|Gold Coast City Council]] began consultation for the redevelopment of the parklands in 2005. By late 2007 the final master plan was released and it was revealed that the stage 1 redevelopment would cost $42 million. Construction of stage 1 began in March 2008 and the finished product opened to the public on 23 August 2009.&lt;ref name="Parklands fight looms"&gt;{{cite news|last=Killoran|first=Matthew|title=Parklands fight looms|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2009/08/24/111101_gold-coast-top-story.html|accessdate=18 November 2011|newspaper=Gold Coast Bulletin|date=24 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of stage 2 began shortly after the opening of stage 1 and was completed in December 2010 at a cost of $17 million. After a few years break, construction of stage 3 began in January 2015 and will cost $10.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/gold-coast/council-begins-105-million-stage-3-of-southport-broadwater-parklands-set-to-open-in-june/story-fnj94idh-1227190005425|title=Southport’s $10.5m face lift|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third stage was opened to the public on 28 February 2016.

===Chinatown===
[[File:Confucius statue, Chinatown, Southport, Queensland.jpg|thumb|left|[[Confucius]] statue in [[Chinatown, Gold Coast|Chinatown]].]]
[[Chinatown, Gold Coast|Gold Coast's Chinatown]] is located in the CBD, focused on Davenport Street and Young Street, and includes the block boundaries of Nerang, Scarborough and Garden Streets. Gold Coast Chinatown is a unique and modern precinct that provides a place for the Gold Coast to celebrate its diversity through culture, design, people and food.  The precinct is continuously evolving with new Asian-inspired businesses, restaurants, cultural embellishments, and offers something different on the first Saturday of every month when its streets come alive with a range of exciting events such as free films, popup bars, multicultural celebrations and the much loved Chinatown Street Markets.

===Education===
[[St Hilda's School]] is the only non-tertiary educational institution located inside the CBD boundaries. St Hilda's opened in 1912 and is a p-12, independent, all girls school located on High Street. Other schools located just outside the CBD boundaries include [[The Southport School]] (TSS), Keebra Park State High School, Southport State School and [[Southport State High School]]. St Hilda's and TSS are members of the prestigious [[Great Public Schools Association of Queensland Inc.|Great Public Schools Association]] and [[Queensland Girls' Secondary Schools Sports Association]] with the top Brisbane schools.

Tertiary education inside the CBD boundaries is provided by Evocca College, [[TAFE Queensland Gold Coast|Gold Coast Institute of TAFE]] and [[Central Queensland University]].

===Religion===
There are two major religious institutions inside the CBD boundaries and both are a denomination of the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith. The Guardian Angels [[Catholicism|Catholic]] Church was established in 1882 along Scarborough Street and is the oldest church in the CBD. Shortly after St. Peter's [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] Church was built in 1887 on the corner of High Street and Nerang Street.

===Theatre===

In 1882, the Southport School of Arts was erected on the corner of Lawson and Scarborough Streets. The school included for 200 people, a stage, dressing rooms and a library. By the early 1900s, the residents of Southport had established a strong interest in the arts and cinematography. Three theatres were built inside the modern day CBD boundaries and were owned by the Thams Brothers. The Regent Theatre, located on Davenport Street, opened in 1912 and was the Gold Coast's first cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/lifestyle/cienna-development-to-be-built-on-site-of-old-regent-cinema-southport-which-opened-in-1912/story-fnsl101z-1227432636992|title=Flashback: Moving on from movies|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to demand, the theatre was expanded between 1918-1920 and increased its capacity to 1000 seats. Further demand saw the Pier Theatre open in 1926 which sat over the Broadwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2009/01/22/41655_gold-coast-news.html|title=Southport jetty to rekindle memories|author=Townsend|first=Melissa|date=22 January 2009|work=goldcoast.com.au|accessdate=31 May 2012|archive-url=http://archive.li/Rgkgw|archive-date=30 Dec 2012|dead-url=yes|publisher=News Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pier Theatre quickly became a very popular venue for pastimes in Southport. A third cinema, Savoy Theatre, was also opened shortly after on the eastern side of Nerang Street.

In December 1938, President Norman Woodroffe handed over the keys of the Southport School of Arts to the [[Returned and Services League of Australia|Returned Servicemen's League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rslclubsouthport.com.au/club-info/our-history/|title=Our History - RSL Club Southport|website=rslclubsouthport.com.au|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 the Gold Coast Little Theatre was formed and moved into their current Scarborough Street premises in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gclt.com.au/history.htm|title=--Dolphin Awards --  Gold Coast Little Theatre, Queensland, Australia|website=www.gclt.com.au|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gold Coast Little Theatre is the only remaining theatre in the CBD.

===Heritage Walk===
The Gold Coast City Council developed a Southport CBD Heritage Walk in 2008 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/thegoldcoast/gold-coast-history-heritage-71.html|title=Gold Coast history and heritage|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Gold Coast City Council]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120055939/http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/thegoldcoast/gold-coast-history-heritage-71.html|archive-date=20 November 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information was gathered by a "Call for Stories" competition with the community. The CBD loop takes 30 minutes and passes the Town Hall, the Catholic Church and the former railway station among other historical sites.

The Sundale Shopping Centre, which opened on 26 March 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/gold-coast/retail-mecca-take-a-look-back-at-the-gold-coasts-iconic-shopping-centres/story-fnj94idh-1226781484184|title=Our first true retail mecca|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first of its kind on the Gold Coast costing a record $7.5M but closed in 1989 after the larger Australia Fair Shopping Centre opened nearby. It was located on {{convert|12|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} of prime real estate facing the Broadwater which was previously the site of the popular Southport Hotel. As well as providing panoramic views of the [[Nerang River]] from the upper floor, it was home to Queensland's first [[Big W]] department store as well as a cinema, restaurants, 45 speciality stores and a 7,000-vehicle car park. It was proposed as a location for the building of the [[Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre|Gold Coast Convention Centre]]. Such a development would have rejuvenated the old administrative centre of the Gold Coast. However, it lost its bid to [[Broadbeach, Queensland|Broadbeach]], in part because of a lack of tourist accommodation in Southport. The site hosted weekly markets throughout the 1990s for several years after its closure, until its eventual demolition in 2003, at which time a time capsule was buried where the popular mall once stood. The area is now home to the [[Meriton]] Brighton on Broadwater development, a mix of high and low rise buildings together with trendy eateries and some retail outlets. In more recent years another a time capsule was discovered on the Sundale site which was buried when the mall was originally constructed. It was originally meant to be opened in the 2000s and was filled with notes and items which were meant to predict what the 21st century would be like. It is now located in the Gold Coast City Council Local Studies Library. In 1983 Scarborough Fair, now known as [[Australia Fair Shopping Centre|Australia Fair]], was opened on Scarborough Street.

==Sport==
Sports facilities located inside the Gold Coast CBD boundaries include the [[Gold Coast Aquatic Centre]], the Gold Coast Sport Fishing Club, James Overall Park, the [[Tennis Gold Coast|Queens Park Tennis Centre]], the Southport Bowls Club and the Southport Croquet Club. The Aquatic Centre and Fishing Club are both located inside the [[Southport Broadwater Parklands]] precinct overlooking the [[Gold Coast Broadwater|Broadwater]]. James Overall Park is located at the southern tip of the CBD boundary along Brighton Parade and houses the Eagles Rugby Union Club. The Tennis Centre and Croquet Club are located at the eastern end of Queen Street and are by far the oldest sports clubs in the CBD. The Queens Park Tennis Centre, established in 1911 as the Logan and Albert Tennis Association and based in [[Beenleigh, Queensland|Beenleigh]], moved to its current headquarters on Queen Street in 1928&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/lifestyle/gold-coast-history-queens-park-tennis-club/news-story/6c8869b0b4096b0882afef8a301c0d00|title=Flashback: Queens Park holds court|publisher=|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the longest running sporting associations on the Gold Coast. Queens Park hosts the prestigious Rose Bowl Championships each year and held exhibition matches with the [[Australia Davis Cup Team|Australian Davis Cup team]] in the late 1950s. Winners of the Rose Bowl include tennis legends such as [[Rod Laver]] and [[Pat Cash]]. In recent years, the club has produced professional top 10 tennis players such as [[Samantha Stosur]] and [[Bernard Tomic]].

[[File:Southport SLSC front.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Southport Surf Lifesaving Club in 2013.]]
Sports facilities located just outside the CBD boundaries include Owen Park, the Southport Surf Life Saving Club and the Southport Yacht Club. Owen Park is located just beyond the western tip of the CBD boundary on Queen Street. In 1883, the Southport Cricket Club, then known as the Wharehouse Cricket Association, was established and set up base at Owen Park. The Southport Harness and Greyhound Racing Club later set up base at Owen Park and shared tenancy with the Cricket Club. In 1962, the [[Southport Sharks]] Australian rules football team, then known as the Southport Magpies, established itself and played out of Owen Park during the cricket off season over the winter months. In 1972, Owen Park was extended when the Southport landfill was built on by the [[Southport Tigers]] and a rugby league field was added to the park. In March 1982, the Gold Coast Australian Football League pulled off a major coup by arranging a [[Australian Football League|VFL]] exhibition match between [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]] and [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] at Owen Park. In 1987, the Sharks and Cricket Club submitted plans to relocate to west Southport and build an oval more suited to their needs. The [[Gold Coast Parklands]] racing facilities were built in 1988 and by 1989 Owen Park was left one sports tenant, the Southport Tigers. In 1999, the Gold Coast Sporting Hall of Fame opened at Owen Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Golden day for elite sports people|date=3 November 2013|url=http://www.southportstar.net/local-athletes-honoured.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224731/http://www.southportstar.net/local-athletes-honoured.html|deadurl=yes|work=Southport Star|location=Queensland|editor=Ian McDougall|accessdate=20 November 2017|archivedate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Southport Surf Life Saving Club and Southport Yacht Club are located over the Broadwater in the bordering suburb of [[Main Beach, Queensland|Main Beach]]. Woodroffe Park, located in the centre of the CBD on Lawson Street, offers public basketball courts and grass areas. It is located next to the Southport Community Centre and is often presumed to be one and the same thing. The Southport Sharks, who were once based just outside the CBD boundaries at Owen Park but now reside 3 kilometres west of the Broadwater Parklands northern tip, have a long history of producing [[Australian Football League|AFL]] players, the most notable being [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] legend [[Nick Riewoldt]], the first and only Queenslander to be taken with the number 1 pick in the [[Australian Football League draft|AFL draft]].

Several schools inside and just outside the CBD boundaries run very successful sports excellence programs. The Southport School has a long history of producing [[Australian Schoolboys rugby union team|Australian rugby schoolboy representatives]] and is a strong competitor in Queensland's premier GPS rugby competition. Keebra Park State High School runs an extremely successful rugby league program and has won several [[GIO Schoolboy Cup|national schoolboy rugby league titles]] in recent years. Both schools have had many students move into the professional leagues of either respective sport following graduation.

==Transport==
[[File:Gold Coast Highway Bridge crossing Nerang River, Southport, Queensland in January 2017.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The [[Sundale Bridge]] connects the Gold Coast CBD to popular tourist destinations [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland|Surfers Paradise]] and [[Main Beach, Queensland|Main Beach]].]]
In 1887, German immigrant [[Johan Meyer]] provided a private ferry service, known as Meyer's Ferry, to residents that connected Southport to modern day Main Beach and Surfers Paradise. The [[South Coast railway line, Queensland|South Coast railway line]] was opened in 1889, which was a 42&amp;nbsp;km extension of the [[Beenleigh railway line]] to the township of [[Town of Southport|Southport]]. The Southport Railway Station was located on the northern end of the CBD along Scarborough Street. In 1964, the South Coast railway line was closed due to the increasing popularity of the motor car and financial losses. The last existing remnant of the site is an east–west road that was laid next to the station, known as Railway Street.
[[File:GCLR Set 1 at Southport South 2014-09-28.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The Southport South [[G:link]] station.]]
Rail transport returned to the CBD in 2014 when the first stage of the [[G:link|Gold Coast light rail]] line opened. The line included four stations inside the CBD boundaries.

Three major roads on the Gold Coast lead into the CBD which come from the south-east/north-east, south-central and the west. The [[Gold Coast Highway]] enters the CBD from Main Beach in south-east and the [[Sundale Bridge]] signifies the southern entrance into the city. The Gold Coast Highway also enters the CBD from [[Labrador, Queensland|Labrador]] in the north-east and [[Loders Creek]] Bridge signifies the northern entrance into the city. [[Ferry Road, Gold Coast|Ferry Road]] enters the CBD from the south-central and officially enters the area as the road intersects with Queen Street. The [[Smith Street Motorway, Gold Coast|Smith Street Motorway]] enters the CBD from the west and officially enters the area as the road intersects High Street and becomes North Street.

'''HeadBlade''' is a [[head shaving]] [[razor]] brand produced by '''The HeadBlade Company'''. Founded by Todd Greene, a 1989 graduate of [[Bowdoin College]], HeadBlade is headquartered in Gardena, California.

== Products ==

HeadBlade’s first commercial product was the HeadBlade Classic, introduced in 1999. The unorthodox design of the Classic was made as a response to the difficulties of head shaving with a regular razor.

The HeadBlade Classic went on to win the IDSA Silver Award for Design Excellence, as well as a spot in [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine’s]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,91439,00.html|title=Best Design 2000|date=2000-12-10|work=Time|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Ten Best Designs of 2000.” In 2005, the Classic was also added to the Permanent Collection at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/89541|title=Todd Greene. "HeadBlade" Razor. 1997-99 {{!}} MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the company began to grow, HeadBlade expanded into a variety of hair care products, including HeadSlick, a specially designed shaving cream, HeadShed Scrub, an exfoliating solution and HeadLube, a scalp moisturizing lotion. Greene also continued improving on the design of his original product.
[[File:Headblade moto.jpg|thumb|The HeadBlade MOTO]]
In 2006, seven years after first introducing the Classic, HeadBlade released the HeadBlade Sport. The Sport kept the same general shape and function as the classic, but added an improved rubber grip to the finger ring and upper pad. Inspired by sport car design, it also added hardened rubber wheels and an improved axel to increase the mobility of the razor. 

In 2012, HeadBlade came out with the HeadBlade ATX. With a design inspired by an all terrain vehicle, the ATX changed the position of the blade to the back of the razor, encouraging action by “pulling” the blade along the head rather than “pushing” it. This was done in order to reduce the learning curve for people who were accustomed to regular razors.

The latest HeadBlade model is the HeadBlade MOTO, which was released in late 2016. The MOTO was awarded a [[Red Dot Design Award]] in 2017 for it’s industrial design and it’s ease of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.headblade.com/blog/headblade-wins-coveted-red-dot-2017-award/|title=HeadBlade Wins coveted Red Dot 2017 Award!!|date=2017-04-05|work=HeadBlade|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[GQ (magazine)|''GQ'' magazine ]] named Todd Greene to the 2010 Bald 100.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gq.com/entertainment/celebrities/201010/bald-100#slide=60]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Heinrich Gattineau''' (6 January 1905 – 27 April 1985) was a [[Germany|German]] [[economist]], [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA) leader, director of [[IG Farben]] and defendant during the [[Nuremberg trials]].

==Early years==
Gattineau was born in [[Bucharest]], the son of Julius Gattineau, a German dentist who had established a practice in [[Romania]].&lt;ref name="memo"&gt;[http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/en/heinrich_gattineau_19051985 Heinrich Gattineau (1905–1985)]&lt;/ref&gt; The young Gattineau was initially educated in [[Switzerland]] before being sent to high school in [[Munich]], ultimately studying economics at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]], completing his doctorate in 1929.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt; He took a minor role in local politics, serving with the right-wing [[Bund Oberland]] in 1923.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt; He married Dr. Wera Fritzsche, with whom he had five children, in 1929.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt;

==Dealing with the Nazi Party==
Gattineau was employed by IG Farben from 1928, becoming head of commercial policy and public relations at the firm in 1931.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt; During the growth of the [[Nazi Party]] it was not uncommon for [[Adolf Hitler]] to attack IG Farben in his speeches due to the presence of some Jewish executives in prominent positions. Fearing the growth of Hitler and the potential ramifications for the business [[Carl Duisberg]] called upon Gattineau, his press secretary at the time, to open contact with the Nazis. Gattineau enlisted the aid of [[Karl Haushofer]], under whom he had studied at university for a time, and after Haushofer vouched for the German credentials of the IG Farben leaders to Hitler the attacks ceased for around a year.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, pp. 135-136&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1932 Gattineau, along with [[Heinrich Bütefisch]], had held a meeting with Hitler at which they discussed the issue of producing synthetic oil, something Hitler felt crucial to end German energy dependence and to ensure his plans for secret rearmament would remain secret were he to be elected. By this time [[Carl Bosch]] was already providing the Nazi Party with funding.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Gattineau's role within IG Farben had grown significantly as in 1932 he had been appointed as head of the newly established Department of Economic Policy (Wipo), an arm of the finance section of IG Farben the purpose of which was to monitor legal, foreign policy and taxation issues that might impact on the relationship between the company and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under the Nazis==
As soon as Hitler came to power Gattineau applied for Nazi Party membership but he was told he would have to wait as the party was unwilling, initially at least, to accept a rush of business executives whom it felt were only seeking membership for reasons of expediency. Nonetheless Gattineau took up a part-time role with the SA in an attempt to prove his Nazi credentials.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; He rose swiftly through the ranks, already holding the role of [[Standartenführer]] by 1934 and being recognised as one of [[Ernst Röhm]]'s main advisers on economic issues.&lt;ref name="Jeff167"&gt;Jeffreys, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

Gattineau's closeness to Röhm almost proved his undoing and as the [[Night of the Long Knives]] got under way on 30 June 1934 he was dragged from his bed and taken into [[Gestapo]] custody under the trumped up charges that he had diverted money from IG Farben to Röhm in order to fund the supposed plot that was used as justification for the massacre of SA members that ensued.&lt;ref name="Jeff167"/&gt; He was interrogated for several hours and feared execution but then was surprisingly released from custody. The reason for his release is uncertain; [[Max Ilgner]] later claimed to have used his influence to secure Gattineau's freedom. Equally it may have simply been the case that Gattineau, as an SA hobbyist, was not considered important enough for the executioners.&lt;ref name="Jeff167"/&gt;

Gattineau immediately resigned from the SA but faced anger at IG Farben where his superior [[Erwin Selck]] attempted to secure his dismissal or deployment away from the company's main [[Unter den Linden]] [[Berlin]] offices to the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, pp. 167-168&lt;/ref&gt; Bosch rejected this move but, in order to reduce Gattineau's public role, made his Wipo subordinate to Ilgner's operations and before long Gattineau also answered to Ilgner with his press duties.&lt;ref name="Jeff168"&gt;Jeffreys, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Despite seemingly coming close to being executed Gattineau was admitted to full membership of the Nazi Party in 1935.&lt;ref name="Jeff168"/&gt;

He spent much of the [[Second World War]] in [[Bratislava]] as a director of Dynamit-Nobel-Fabrik and other [[Czechoslovakia]]n chemical companies that had been brought under the IG Farben umbrella by the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Jutta Günther, Dagmara Jajesniak-Quast: ''Willkommene Investoren oder nationaler Ausverkauf?

BWV, 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-8305-1186-1}}, p. 155, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war==
In 1947 Gattineau was one of 24 executives indicted for war crimes by the [[United States]] as part of what became known as the [[IG Farben trial]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; He was however acquitted of all charges and released.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; He secured a number of boardroom positions in the corporate world following the trial.&lt;ref name="memo"/&gt;

==Economic role==
Businesses that produce household goods are categorized as [[Procyclical|Cyclical]] [[Consumer Products]] by the [[Thomson Reuters Business Classification]] and are organized into three sub-categories:
*[[Consumer electronics|Consumer Electronics]],
*[[Home appliance|Appliances]], [[Tool]]s &amp; Housewares, and
*Home Furnishings (such as [[furniture]]).

Household goods are a significant part of a country's economy, with their purchase the topic of magazines such as ''[[Consumer Reports]]'', their relocation handled by [[Moving company|moving companies]], and their disposal or redistribution facilitated by companies like [[Goodwill Industries]], services like [[classified advertising]] and [[Craigslist]], and events such as [[garage sale]]s and [[car boot sale]]s.

Their safety is often regulated by governments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emsd.gov.hk/emsd/eng/pps/electricity_pub_epsr.shtml Outline of Electrical Products (Safety) Regulation] from a [[Government of Hong Kong]] website &lt;/ref&gt; which also promote and facilitate their import and export.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?r.s=sc&amp;r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.lc=en&amp;r.l3=1078151046&amp;r.l2=1077717231&amp;type=RESOURCES&amp;itemId=1078151097 Household goods, furniture and furnishings] from a [[HM Revenue and Customs]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hussein Shire''' ({{lang-so|Xuseen Shire}}, {{lang-ar|حسين شاير}}) was a [[Somali people|Somali]] entrepreneur. He was the owner and CEO of the Gateway Bus Company.

==Personal life==
Shire was born between 1928 and 1929 in [[Galkaio]], [[Somalia]] to ethnic Somali parents. He comes from a middle-class background,[3] and belongs to the [[Shekhal]] [[Hawiye]] clan.[4].&lt;ref name=MONITORRISE /&gt;

He was married to Mariam Hussein, with whom he had nine children; five girls and four boys.&lt;ref name=NEWVISDEATH&gt;{{cite web|title=Gateway bus founder dies in South Africa|url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/657075-gateway-proprietor-hussein-shiire-dies-in-south-africa.html|website=New Vision|accessdate=1 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714143810/http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/657075-gateway-proprietor-hussein-shiire-dies-in-south-africa.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shire spent much of his life running his business empire. On 28 June 2014, he died in a hospital in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]] after undergoing knee surgery. According to relatives, he had also been battling a number of kidney-related ailments. Shire was 85 years old.&lt;ref name=NEWVISDEATH /&gt;

==Career==
Shire started his career in the transport industry, ferrying passengers in a blue Peugeot 504 car. He also owned a grocery shop, and would sell sodas and ice to travellers.&lt;ref name=MONITORRISE&gt;{{cite web|title=The rise, fall and rise of Uganda’s rich|url=https://www.mail-archive.com/ugandanet@kym.net/msg11004.html|website=Sunday Monitor|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his son, Abdullahi Shire, Hussein Shire was among a handful of entrepreneurs to start businesses in the area during the 1950s.&lt;ref name=NEWVISDEATH /&gt;

With profits from his shop and the Peugeot business, Shire bought a minibus and a trailer. In the 1980s, he established the Gateway Bus Company, his first large firm.&lt;ref name=MONITORRISE /&gt;&lt;ref name=NEWVISDEATH /&gt;

Serving as the its owner and CEO, Gateway grew into one of the largest bus companies in Uganda, with more than 100 buses operating all over the country. Gateway now also operates routes to Kenya and South Sudan.&lt;ref name=MONITORRISE /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uganda's booming border town|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6129568.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides that firm, Shire also owned a number of other businesses. Among these were Shire Petroleum, real estate, Hussein Stores, a shop located along Tagore Road in Tororo, and a 2,000 acre sugarcane plantation that supplied Kakira Sugar Works and Mayuge Sugar Works.&lt;ref name=NEWVISDEATH /&gt;

'''Hydrogenation''' – meaning, to treat with [[hydrogen]] – is a [[chemical reaction]] between molecular hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and another compound or element, usually in the presence of a [[Catalysis|catalyst]] such as [[nickel]], [[palladium]] or [[platinum]]. The process is commonly employed to [[redox|reduce]] or [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturate]] [[organic compound]]s. Hydrogenation typically constitutes the addition of pairs of [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s to a molecule, often an [[alkene]]. [[Catalyst]]s are required for the reaction to be usable; non-catalytic hydrogenation takes place only at very high temperatures. Hydrogenation reduces [[Double bond|double]] and [[Triple bond|triple]] bonds in [[hydrocarbon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudlický|first=Miloš|title=Reductions in Organic Chemistry|publisher=[[American Chemical Society]]|year=1996|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=429|isbn=0-8412-3344-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
It has three components, the [[saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] substrate, the hydrogen (or hydrogen source) and, invariably, a catalyst. The [[redox|reduction]] reaction is carried out at different temperatures and pressures depending upon the substrate and the activity of the catalyst.

===Related or competing reactions===
The same catalysts and conditions that are used for hydrogenation reactions can also lead to isomerization of the alkenes from cis to trans.  This process is of great interest because hydrogenation technology generates most of the [[trans fat]] in foods (see {{section link||Food industry}} below). A reaction where bonds are broken while hydrogen is added is called [[hydrogenolysis]], a reaction that may occur to carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom ([[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]] or [[halogen]]) bonds.  Some hydrogenations of polar bonds are accompanied by hydrogenolysis.

===Hydrogen sources===
For hydrogenation, the obvious source of hydrogen is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas itself, which is typically available commercially within the storage medium of a pressurized cylinder. The hydrogenation process often uses greater than 1 atmosphere of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, usually conveyed from the cylinders and sometimes augmented by "booster pumps". Gaseous hydrogen is produced industrially from hydrocarbons by the process known as [[steam reforming]].&lt;ref name=Rylander&gt;Paul N. Rylander, "Hydrogenation and Dehydrogenation" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a13_487}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For many applications, hydrogen is transferred from donor molecules such as formic acid, isopropanol, and dihydroanthracene. These hydrogen donors undergo [[dehydrogenation]] to, respectively, carbon dioxide, acetone, and anthracene.  These processes are called [[transfer hydrogenation]]s.

===Substrates===
An important characteristic of alkene and alkyne hydrogenations, both the homogeneously and heterogeneously catalyzed versions, is that hydrogen addition occurs with "[[syn addition]]", with hydrogen entering from the least hindered side.&lt;ref&gt;''Advanced Organic Chemistry'' Jerry March 2nd Edition&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction can be performed on a variety of different [[functional group]]s.

===Catalysts===
With rare exceptions, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is unreactive toward organic compounds in the absence of metal catalysts. The unsaturated substrate is [[chemisorption|chemisorbed]] onto the catalyst, with most sites covered by the substrate. In heterogeneous catalysts, hydrogen forms surface hydrides (M-H) from which hydrogens can be transferred to the chemisorbed substrate. Platinum, palladium, [[Rhodium-catalyzed hydrogenation|rhodium]], and ruthenium form highly active catalysts, which operate at lower temperatures and lower pressures of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Non-precious metal catalysts, especially those based on nickel (such as [[Raney nickel]] and [[Urushibara nickel]]) have also been developed as economical alternatives, but they are often slower or require higher temperatures. The trade-off is activity (speed of reaction) vs. cost of the catalyst and cost of the apparatus required for use of high pressures. Notice that the Raney-nickel catalysed hydrogenations require high pressures:&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|author=C. F. H. Allen and James VanAllan|title=m-Toylybenzylamine|collvol=3|collvolpages=827|year=1955 |prep=CV3P0827}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|author=A. B. Mekler, S. Ramachandran, S. Swaminathan, and Melvin S. Newman|title=2-Methyl-1,3-Cyclohexanedione|collvol=5|collvolpages=743|year=1973|prep=CV5P0743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catalysts are usually classified into two broad classes: [[homogeneous catalyst]]s and [[heterogeneous catalyst]]s. Homogeneous catalysts dissolve in the solvent that contains the unsaturated substrate. Heterogeneous catalysts are solids that are suspended in the same solvent with the substrate or are treated with gaseous substrate.

====Homogeneous catalysts====
Some well known homogeneous catalysts are indicated below.  These are [[coordination complex]]es that activate both the unsaturated substrate and the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Most typically, these complexes contain platinum group metals, especially Rh and Ir.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Homogeneous catalysts are also used in asymmetric synthesis by the hydrogenation of prochiral substrates.  An early demonstration of this approach was the Rh-catalyzed hydrogenation of enamides as precursors to the drug L-DOPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knowles|first1=W. S.|title=Application of organometallic catalysis to the commercial production of L-DOPA|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|date=March 1986|volume=63|issue=3|pages=222|doi=10.1021/ed063p222|bibcode=1986JChEd..63..222K}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve asymmetric reduction, these catalyst are made chiral by use of chiral diphosphine ligands.&lt;ref name="Textbook" /&gt; Rhodium catalyzed hydrogenation has also been used in the herbicide production of S-metolachlor, which uses a Josiphos type ligand (called Xyliphos).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaser|first1=Hans-Ulrich|last2=Pugin|first2=Benoît|last3=Spindler|first3=Felix|last4=Thommen|first4=Marc|title=From a Chiral Switch to a Ligand Portfolio for Asymmetric Catalysis|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|date=December 2007|volume=40|issue=12|pages=1240–1250|doi=10.1021/ar7001057}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In principle asymmetric hydrogenation can be catalyzed by chiral heterogeneous catalysts,&lt;ref name=Mallet&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cr0683663 | title = Asymmetric Catalysis at Chiral Metal Surfaces | year = 2007 | last1 = Mallat | first1 = T. | last2 = Orglmeister | first2 = E. | last3 = Baiker | first3 = A. | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 107 | issue = 11 | pages = 4863–90 | pmid = 17927256}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this approach remains more of a curiosity than a useful technology.

====Heterogeneous catalysts====
Heterogeneous catalysts for hydrogenation are more common industrially. In industry, precious metal hydrogenation catalysts are deposited from solution as a fine powder on the support, which is a cheap, bulky, porous, usually granular material, such as [[activated carbon]], [[alumina]], [[calcium carbonate]] or [[barium sulfate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alfa.com/en/platinum-heterogeneous-catalysts/|title=Platinum Heterogeneous Catalysts - Alfa Aesar|author=|date=|website=www.alfa.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118181608/https://www.alfa.com/en/platinum-heterogeneous-catalysts/|archivedate=18 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, platinum on carbon is produced by reduction of [[chloroplatinic acid]] ''in situ'' in carbon. Examples of these catalysts are 5% [[ruthenium]] on [[activated carbon]], or 1% [[platinum]] on [[alumina]]. Base metal catalysts, such as [[Raney nickel]], are typically much cheaper and do not need a support. Also, in the laboratory, unsupported (massive) precious metal catalysts such as [[platinum black]] are still used, despite the cost.

As in homogeneous catalysts, the activity is adjusted through changes in the environment around the metal, i.e. the [[coordination sphere]]. Different [[miller index|faces]] of a crystalline heterogeneous catalyst display distinct activities, for example. This can be modified by mixing metals or using different preparation techniques. Similarly, heterogeneous catalysts are affected by their supports.

In many cases, highly empirical modifications involve selective "poisons". Thus, a carefully chosen catalyst can be used to hydrogenate some functional groups without affecting others, such as the hydrogenation of alkenes without touching aromatic rings, or the selective hydrogenation of [[alkynes]] to alkenes using [[Lindlar catalyst|Lindlar's catalyst]]. For example, when the catalyst [[palladium]] is placed on [[barium sulfate]] and then treated with [[quinoline]], the resulting catalyst reduces alkynes only as far as alkenes. The Lindlar catalyst has been applied to the conversion of [[phenylacetylene]] to [[styrene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|author=H. Lindlar and R.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Transfer hydrogenation===
[[File:THintermed.png|thumb|300px|right|The [[transition state]] of two transfer-hydrogenation reactions from ruthenium-hydride complexes onto carbonyls]]
[[Transfer hydrogenation]] uses other hydrogen donor molecules in place of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; itself. These reactants, which can also serve as [[solvent]]s for the reaction, include [[hydrazine]], [[Dialin|dihydronaphthalene]], dihydroanthracene, [[isopropanol]], and [[formic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;van Es, T.; Staskun, B. "Aldehydes from Aromatic Nitriles: 4-Formylbenzenesulfonamide" ''[[Org. Synth.]]'', Coll. Vol. 6, p. 631 (1988). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv6p0631 Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223200/http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv6p0631 |date=2007-09-27 }})&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction involves an outer-sphere mechanism.

In [[organic synthesis]], transfer hydrogenation is useful for the asymmetric reduction of polar unsaturated substrates, such as [[ketone]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, and [[imine]]s. The hydrogenation of polar substrates such as ketones and aldehydes typically requires transfer hydrogenation, at least reactions that use [[homogeneous catalyst]]s.  These catalysts are readily generated in chiral forms, which is the basis of asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones.

===Electrolytic hydrogenation===
[[Chemical polarity|Polar]] substrates such as [[nitriles]] can be hydrogenated [[electrosynthesis#Cathodic reductions|electrochemically]], using [[protic solvent]]s and reducing equivalents as the source of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ed081p1350 | title = Catalytic Hydrogenation of Organic Compounds without H2 Supply: An Electrochemical System | year = 2004 | last1 = Navarro | first1 = Daniela Maria do Amaral Ferraz | last2 = Navarro | first2 = Marcelo | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | volume = 81 | issue = 9 | pages = 1350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermodynamics and mechanism==
The addition of hydrogen to double or triple bonds in [[hydrocarbons]] is a type of [[redox]] reaction that can be thermodynamically favorable. For example, the addition of hydrogen to an alkene has a [[Gibbs free energy]] change of -101 kJ·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Textbook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|title=Shriver &amp; Atkins' inorganic chemistry.|date=2010|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Co.|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4292-1820-7|page=696|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the reaction rate for most hydrogenation reactions is negligible in the absence of catalysts.
Hydrogenation is a strongly [[exothermic]] reaction. In the hydrogenation of vegetable oils and fatty acids, for example, the heat released is about 25 kcal per mole (105 kJ/mol), sufficient to raise the temperature of the oil by 1.6–1.7&amp;nbsp;°C per [[iodine number]] drop. The [[reaction mechanism|mechanism]] of metal-catalyzed hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes has been extensively studied.&lt;ref&gt;Kubas, G. J., "Metal Dihydrogen and σ-Bond Complexes", Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers: New York, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; First of all [[isotope labeling]] using [[deuterium]] confirms the [[regiochemistry]] of the addition:
:RCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → RCHDCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D

===Heterogeneous catalysis===
On solids, the accepted mechanism is the Horiuti-[[Michael Polanyi|Polanyi]] mechanism:&lt;ref&gt;Gallezot, Pierre. "Hydrogenation - Heterogeneous" in Encyclopedia of Catalysis, Volume 4, ed. Horvath, I.T., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1039/TF9343001164 | title = Exchange reactions of hydrogen on metallic catalysts | year = 1934 | last1 = Horiuti | first1 = Iurô | last2 = Polanyi | first2 = M. | journal = Transactions of the Faraday Society | volume = 30 | pages = 1164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Binding of the unsaturated bond, and hydrogen dissociation into atomic hydrogen onto the catalyst
# Addition of one atom of hydrogen; this step is reversible
# Addition of the second atom; effectively irreversible under hydrogenating conditions.

In the second step, the metallointermediate formed is a saturated compound that can rotate and then break down, again detaching the alkene from the catalyst. Consequently, contact with a hydrogenation catalyst necessarily causes ''cis-trans''-isomerization, because the isomerization is thermodynamically favorable. This is a problem in partial hydrogenation, while in complete hydrogenation the produced ''trans''-alkene is eventually hydrogenated.

For aromatic substrates, the first bond is hardest to hydrogenate because of the free energy penalty for breaking the aromatic system. The product of this is a cyclohexadiene, which is extremely active and cannot be isolated; in conditions reducing enough to break the aromatization, it is immediately reduced to a cyclohexene. The [[cyclohexene]] is ordinarily reduced immediately to a fully saturated cyclohexane, but special modifications to the catalysts (such as the use of the anti-solvent water on ruthenium) can preserve some of the cyclohexene, if that is a desired product.

===Homogeneous catalysis===
In many homogeneous hydrogenation processes,&lt;ref&gt;Johannes G. de Vries, Cornelis J. Elsevier, eds. The Handbook of Homogeneous Hydrogenation Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2007. {{ISBN|978-3-527-31161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the metal binds to both components to give an intermediate alkene-metal(H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex. The general sequence of reactions is assumed to be as follows or a related sequence of steps:
* binding of the hydrogen to give a dihydride complex via [[oxidative addition]] (preceding the oxidative addition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the formation of a [[dihydrogen complex]]):
:L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;M + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;MH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
* binding of alkene:
:L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;M(η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CHR → L&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;MH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CHR) + L
* transfer of one hydrogen atom from the metal to carbon (migratory insertion)
:L&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;MH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CHR) → L&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;M(H)(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R)
* transfer of the second hydrogen atom from the metal to the alkyl group with simultaneous dissociation of the alkane ("reductive elimination")
:L&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;M(H)(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) → L&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;M + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R

==Inorganic substrates==
The hydrogenation of nitrogen to give ammonia is conducted on a vast scale by the [[Haber-Bosch]] process, consuming an estimated 1% of the [[World energy consumption|world's energy supply]].
:&lt;chem title="Hydrogenation of nitrogen"&gt;
\underset{nitrogen}{N{\equiv}N} + \underset{hydrogen\atop (200 atm)}{3H2} -&gt;[\ce{Fe\ catalyst}][350-550^\circ\ce C] \underset{ammonia}{2NH3}
&lt;/chem&gt;
Oxygen can be partially hydrogenated to give [[hydrogen peroxide]], although this process has not been commercialized

==Industrial applications==
Catalytic hydrogenation has diverse industrial uses. Most frequently, industrial hydrogenation relies on heterogeneous catalysts.&lt;ref name=Rylander/&gt;

===Food industry{{anchor|In_the_food_industry}}===
{{fats}}
The largest scale application of hydrogenation is for the processing of [[vegetable oil]]s.&lt;ref name=Rylander/&gt; Typical vegetable oils are derived from [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s (containing more than one carbon-carbon [[double bond]]). Their partial hydrogenation reduces most, but not all, of these carbon-carbon double bonds. The degree of hydrogenation is controlled by restricting the amount of hydrogen, reaction temperature and time, and the catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;Ian P. Freeman "Margarines and Shortenings" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a16_145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[File:H2forMargerin.png|thumb|320px|Partial hydrogenation of a typical plant oil to a typical component of margarine. Most of the C=C double bonds are removed in this process, which elevates the melting point of the product.]]

Hydrogenation converts liquid [[vegetable oil]]s into solid or semi-solid fats, such as those present in [[margarine]]. Changing the degree of saturation of the fat changes some important physical properties, such as the melting range, which is why liquid oils become semi-solid. Solid or semi-solid fats are preferred for baking because the way the fat mixes with flour produces a more desirable texture in the baked product. Because partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are cheaper than animal fats, are available in a wide range of consistencies, and have other desirable characteristics (such as increased oxidative [[chemical stability|stability]] and longer [[shelf life]]), they are the predominant fats used as [[shortening]] in most commercial baked goods.

A side effect of incomplete hydrogenation having implications for human health is the [[isomerization]] of some of the remaining unsaturated carbon bonds to their [[trans isomer]]s. [[Trans fat]]s (resulting from partial hydrogenation) have been implicated in circulatory diseases including [[heart disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Teresa Tarrago-Trani | first1 = Maria | last2 = Phillips | first2 = Katherine M. | last3 = Lemar | first3 = Linda E. | last4 = Holden | first4 = Joanne M. | year = 2006 | title = New and Existing Oils and Fats Used in Products with Reduced Trans-Fatty Acid Content | url = https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Articles/JADA106_867-880.pdf| journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 106 | issue = | pages = 867–880 | doi = 10.1016/j.jada.2006.03.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion from cis to trans bonds is favored because the trans configuration has lower energy than the natural cis one. At equilibrium, the trans/cis isomer ratio is about 2:1. Many countries and regions have introduced mandatory labeling of trans fats on food products and appealed to the industry for voluntary reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/healthy-living/deadly-fats-why-are-we-still-eating-them-843400.html|title=Deadly fats: why are we still eating them?|date=2008-06-10|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2008-06-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614071803/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/healthy-living/deadly-fats-why-are-we-still-eating-them-843400.html|archivedate=2008-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16051436/|title=New York City passes trans fat ban|date=2006-12-05|publisher=[[msnbc]]|accessdate=2010-01-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106041324/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16051436/|archivedate=2010-01-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/health/fda-gives-food-industry-three-years-eliminate-trans-fats.html|title=F.D.A.

===Petrochemical industry===
In petrochemical processes, hydrogenation is used to convert alkenes and aromatics into saturated alkanes (paraffins) and cycloalkanes (naphthenes), which are less toxic and less reactive. Relevant to liquid fuels that are stored sometimes for long periods in air, saturated hydrocarbons exhibit superior storage properties.  On the other hand, alkene tend to form [[hydroperoxide]]s, which can form gums that interfere with fuel handing equipment.  For example, [[mineral turpentine]] is usually hydrogenated. [[Hydrocracking]] of heavy residues into diesel is another application. In [[isomerization]] and [[catalytic reforming]] processes, some hydrogen pressure is maintained to [[Hydrogenolysis|hydrogenolyze]] [[Petroleum coke|coke]] formed on the catalyst and prevent its accumulation.

===Organic chemistry===
Hydrogenation is a useful means for converting unsaturated compounds into saturated derivatives.  Substrates include not only alkenes and alkynes, but also aldehydes, imines, and nitriles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Werkmeister|first1=Svenja|last2=Junge|first2=Kathrin|last3=Beller|first3=Matthias|title=Catalytic Hydrogenation of Carboxylic Acid Esters, Amides, and Nitriles with Homogeneous Catalysts|journal=Organic Process Research &amp; Development|date=2 February 2014|volume=18|issue=2|pages=289–302|doi=10.1021/op4003278}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are converted into the corresponding saturated compounds, i.e. alcohols and amines.  Thus, alkyl aldehydes, which can be synthesized with the [[oxo process]] from [[carbon monoxide]] and an alkene, can be converted to alcohols. E.g. [[1-propanol]] is produced from propionaldehyde, produced from ethene and carbon monoxide. [[Xylitol]], a [[polyol]], is produced by hydrogenation of the sugar [[xylose]], an aldehyde. Primary amines can be synthesized by [[Nitrile reduction|hydrogenation of nitriles]], while nitriles are readily synthesized from cyanide and a suitable electrophile. For example, isophorone diamine, a precursor to the [[polyurethane]] monomer [[isophorone diisocyanate]], is produced from isophorone nitrile by a tandem nitrile hydrogenation/reductive amination by ammonia, wherein hydrogenation converts both the nitrile into an amine and the imine formed from the aldehyde and ammonia into another amine.

==History==

===Heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation===
The earliest hydrogenation is that of [[platinum]] [[catalysis|catalyzed]] addition of hydrogen to oxygen in the [[Döbereiner's lamp]], a device commercialized as early as 1823. The French chemist [[Paul Sabatier (chemist)|Paul Sabatier]] is considered the father of the hydrogenation process. In 1897, building on the earlier work of [[James F. Boyce, Sr.|James Boyce]], an American chemist working in the manufacture of soap products, he discovered that traces of nickel catalyzed the addition of hydrogen to molecules of gaseous hydrocarbons in what is now known as the [[Sabatier process]]. For this work, Sabatier shared the 1912 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. [[Wilhelm Normann]] was awarded a patent in Germany in 1902 and in Britain in 1903 for the hydrogenation of liquid oils, which was the beginning of what is now a worldwide industry. The commercially important [[Haber–Bosch process]], first described in 1905, involves hydrogenation of nitrogen. In the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]], reported in 1922 carbon monoxide, which is easily derived from coal, is hydrogenated to liquid fuels.

In 1922, Voorhees and Adams described an apparatus for performing hydrogenation under pressures above one atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jacsat/1922/44/i06/f-pdf/f_ja01427a021.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910124034/http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jacsat/1922/44/i06/f-pdf/f_ja01427a021.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parr shaker, the first product to allow hydrogenation using elevated pressures and temperatures, was commercialized in 1926 based on Voorhees and Adams' research and remains in widespread use. In 1924 [[Murray Raney]] developed a finely powdered form of nickel, which is widely used to catalyze hydrogenation reactions such as conversion of nitriles to amines or the production of margarine.

===Homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation===
In the 1930s, Calvin discovered that copper(II) complexes oxidized H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The 1960s witnessed the development of well defined [[homogeneous catalyst]]s using transition metal complexes, e.g., [[Wilkinson's catalyst]] (RhCl(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Soon thereafter cationic Rh and Ir were found catalyze the hydrogenation of alkenes and carbonyls.&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schrock|first1=Richard R.|last2=Osborn|first2=John A.|title=Catalytic hydrogenation using cationic rhodium complexes.

Pettinari, F. Marchetti, D. Martini "Metal Complexes as Hydrogenation Catalysts" Comprehensive Coordination Chemistry II, 2004, volume 9. pp. 75–139. {{DOI|10.1016/B0-08-043748-6/09125-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of homogeneous hydrogenation was influenced by work started in the 1930s and 1940s on the [[oxo process]] and [[Ziegler–Natta polymerization]].

==Metal-free hydrogenation==
For most practical purposes, hydrogenation requires a metal catalyst. Hydrogenation can, however, proceed from some hydrogen donors without catalysts, illustrative hydrogen donors being [[diimide]] and [[aluminium isopropoxide]], the latter illustrated by the [[Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction]].  Some metal-free catalytic systems have been investigated in academic research. One such system for reduction of [[ketone]]s consists of [[Tert-Butanol|''tert''-butanol]] and [[potassium tert-butoxide]] and very high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01072a028 | title = Homogeneous Hydrogenation in the Absence of Transition-Metal Catalysts | year = 1964 | last1 = Walling | first1 = Cheves. | last2 = Bollyky | first2 = Laszlo. | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 86 | issue = 18 | pages = 3750}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction depicted below describes the hydrogenation of [[benzophenone]]:

Another system for metal-free hydrogenation is based on the [[phosphine]]-[[borane]], compound '''1''', which has been called a ''[[frustrated Lewis pair]]''. It reversibly accepts dihydrogen at relatively low temperatures to form the [[phosphonium]] [[borate]] '''2''' which can reduce simple hindered [[imine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/anie.200702908 | title = Metal-Free Catalytic Hydrogenation | year = 2007 | last1 = Chase | first1 = Preston A. | last2 = Welch | first2 = Gregory C. | last3 = Jurca | first3 = Titel | last4 = Stephan | first4 = Douglas W. | journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition | volume = 46 | issue = 42 | pages = 8050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[File:MetalfreehydrogenationPhosphineBorane.svg|400px|Metal free hydrogenation Phosphine Borane]]

The reduction of [[nitrobenzene]] to [[aniline]] has been reported to be catalysed by [[fullerene]], its mono-anion, atmospheric hydrogen and UV light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja9061097 | title = A Nonmetal Catalyst for Molecular Hydrogen Activation with Comparable Catalytic Hydrogenation Capability to Noble Metal Catalyst | year = 2009 | last1 = Li | first1 = Baojun | last2 = Xu | first2 = Zheng | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 131 | issue = 45 | pages = 16380–2 | pmid = 19845383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment used for hydrogenation==
Today's bench chemist has three main choices of hydrogenation equipment:
* Batch hydrogenation under atmospheric conditions
* Batch hydrogenation at elevated temperature and/or pressure&lt;ref name=Apparatus&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Roger|last2=Voorhees|first2=V.|title=Apparatus for catalytic reduction|journal=Organic Syntheses|date=1928|volume=8|page=10|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.008.0010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flow hydrogenation

===Batch hydrogenation under atmospheric conditions===
The original and still a commonly practised form of hydrogenation in teaching laboratories, this process is usually effected by adding solid catalyst to a [[round bottom flask]] of dissolved reactant which has been evacuated using [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]] gas and sealing the mixture with a penetrable rubber seal. Hydrogen gas is then supplied from a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-filled [[balloon]]. The resulting three phase mixture is agitated to promote mixing. Hydrogen uptake can be monitored, which can be useful for monitoring progress of a hydrogenation. This is achieved by either using a graduated tube containing a coloured liquid, usually aqueous [[copper sulfate]] or with [[Sight glass|gauges]] for each reaction vessel.

===Batch hydrogenation at elevated temperature and/or pressure===
Since many hydrogenation reactions such as [[hydrogenolysis]] of [[protecting groups]] and the reduction of [[aromatic]] systems proceed extremely sluggishly at atmospheric temperature and pressure, pressurised systems are popular. In these cases, catalyst is added to a solution of reactant under an inert atmosphere in a [[pressure vessel]]. Hydrogen is added directly from a cylinder or built in laboratory hydrogen source, and the pressurized slurry is mechanically rocked to provide agitation, or a spinning basket is used.&lt;ref name=Apparatus /&gt; Heat may also be used, as the pressure compensates for the associated reduction in gas solubility.

===Flow hydrogenation===
Flow hydrogenation has become a popular technique at the bench and increasingly the process scale. This technique involves continuously flowing a dilute stream of dissolved reactant over a fixed bed catalyst in the presence of hydrogen. Using established [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] technology, this technique allows the application of pressures from atmospheric to {{convert|1450|psi|bar|abbr=on}}. Elevated temperatures may also be used. At the bench scale, systems use a range of pre-packed catalysts which eliminates the need for weighing and filtering [[pyrophoric]] catalysts.

===Industrial reactors===
Catalytic hydrogenation is done in a [[Plug flow reactor model|tubular plug-flow reactor]] (PFR) packed with a supported catalyst. The pressures and temperatures are typically high, although this depends on the catalyst. Catalyst loading is typically much lower than in laboratory batch hydrogenation, and various promoters are added to the metal, or mixed metals are used, to improve activity, selectivity and catalyst stability. The use of nickel is common despite its low activity, due to its low cost compared to precious metals.

Gas Liquid Induction Reactors (Hydrogenator) are also used for carrying out catalytic hydrogenation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0009-2509(82)80171-1 | title = Mechanically agitated gas–liquid reactors | year = 1982 | last1 = Joshi | first1 = J.B. | last2 = Pandit | first2 = A.B. | last3 = Sharma | first3 = M.M. | journal = Chemical Engineering Science | volume = 37 | issue = 6 | pages = 813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jakob Christof Rad''', born March 25, 1799 in [[Rheinfelden]] (present day Switzerland), died October 13, 1871 in [[Vienna]] (present day Austria), was a [[Swiss]]-born physician and industrial manager. Sometimes appearing as the Anglicised, ''Jacob Christoph,'' Rad, among many other professional activities, was a director of a sugar factory in [[Dačice|Datschitz]] in [[Moravia]] in 1843, and invented the process and associated machinery for cutting large block sugar into manageable uniform pieces (and so is credited with "invention" of the [[Sugar#Cubes|sugar cubes]]).

He had a sweet tooth growing up.

==Professional life==
{{expand section|other significant areas of his professional life, with reliable sourcing, including his medical and other industrial management activities, so that this article does not remain, just of further retelling of the apocryphal, largely trivial story of the "discovery" of sugar cubes|small=no|date=July 2015}}

===Invention of the sugar-cutting process===
The idea to produce sugar in cube form came from his wife, who cut herself while paring down the standard large, commercial sugar loaf into smaller parts for use in the home. Rad had become involved with management of a sugar factory in 1840 (in Datschitz, present day Dačice, in [[Moravia]], a part of the [[Habsburg empire]]).  He began work on a machine for transforming sugar into cube form, leading to a five-year [[patent]] for the cube press he invented, granted on January 23, 1843.

==Personal life==
Rad was father of 16 children. He died in 1871 in Vienna.

'''Johannes Amsinck''' (23 March 1792 in [[Hamburg]] &amp;ndash; 8 September 1879 in Hamburg) was a German businessman and philanthropist.

A member of the Dutch-origined [[Amsinck family]], he was a son of Hamburg mayor [[Wilhelm Amsinck]]. In 1815 he became a co-owner of the firm ''Johannes Schuback &amp; Söhne'', which had been founded by his maternal grandfather, and became the sole owner in 1837. The firm focused on the trade with [[South America]], and Amsinck played a major role in the establishment of the shipping companies [[HAPAG]] and [[Hamburg Süd]].&lt;ref&gt;Renate Hauschild-Thiessen: "Amsinck, Johannes."

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in New York City, John Elkann is the first son of [[Alain Elkann]], a New York-born journalist and writer of [[French Jewish]] and [[Italian Jewish]] background,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2010/06/13/news-opinion/world/noted-italian-writer-appeals-for-israel Jewish Telegraph Agency: "Noted Italian writer appeals for Israel" By Ruth Ellen Gruber] June 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and his then wife Italian [[Margherita Agnelli]]. His parents divorced in 1981 and both have remarried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cinquantamila.it/storyTellerThread.php?threadId=GRECO%20Rosi |title= Biografia di Rosi Greco |website= www.cinquantamila.it |date=2010-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thepeerage.com/p16329.htm |title= Margherita Agnelli |website= www.thepeerage.com |date= 2005-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elkann's maternal grandparents were the industrialist [[Gianni Agnelli]] and the Italian socialite [[Marella Agnelli]] (born Donna Marella [[Caracciolo]] di Castagneto). His paternal great-grand-uncle was the banker [[Ettore Ovazza]].

He has a brother, [[Lapo Elkann|Lapo]], and a sister, [[Ginevra Elkann|Ginevra]], as well as five half-siblings from his mother's second marriage, as Margherita Agnelli de Pahlen, to Serge de Pahlen. His younger half-siblings are: Maria (born 1983), Pierre (born 1986), twins Sophie and Anna (born 1988) and Tatiana (born 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneall.net/I/per_page.php?id=122757 |title= Margherita Agnelli, * 1955 |publisher= Geneall.net |date= |accessdate=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p16329.htm#i163290 |title= Person Page 16329 |publisher= Thepeerage.com |date= |accessdate= 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geneagraphie.com/getperson.php?personID=I97223&amp;tree=1 |title=Edoardo Agnelli b. 2 Jan 1892 Verona d. 1935: Geneagraphie - Families all over the world |publisher= Geneagraphie |date= |accessdate=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elkann attended primary school in the United Kingdom and Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/business/industrialist-heir-to-the-fiat-dynasty-charts-his-course.html?mcubz=3 |title= Industrialist Heir to the Fiat Dynasty Chart His Course |work= www.nytimes.com |date= 2015-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before his family moved to Paris, where he obtained a [[baccalauréat scientifique]] at the State School [[Lycée Victor-Duruy]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alumni.polito.it/testimonial_elkann |title=Testimonial - John Elkann, Presidente di FCA ed EXOR |publisher=Politecnico di Torino}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year, he moved to Italy to attend the [[Politecnico di Torino]] (Turin), where he graduated with a degree in management engineering in 2000.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; As a result of his international upbringing, he is fluent in four languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0693507a-4830-11e0-b323-00144feab49a.html#axzz1GZU7VVRA|title=Unlikely heir who saved the family jewels|newspaper=Financial Times|date=2 March 2011}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
While pursuing a degree in engineering, Elkann gained work experience through several internships: headlight plant in [[Birmingham]], England (1996), production line in [[Tychy]], Poland (1997), car dealership in [[Lille]], France (1998) and also at GE's CIG (corporate initiatives group) where he worked on a thesis on e-auctions (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.exor.com/data/board/John-Elkann/cv_enBinary/JE_cv_eng.pdf |title= John Elkann |website= www.exor.com |date= 2017-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1997, Elkann was selected by his grandfather Gianni Agnelli to take the place in the family business of [[:it:Giovanni Alberto Agnelli|Giovanni Alberto Agnelli]], the son of Gianni's younger brother, [[Umberto Agnelli|Umberto]], who had died at the age of 33. He was appointed to the Fiat board at the age of 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fcagroup.com/en-US/group/governance/board_of_directors/FiatDocuments/CDA/john_elkann.pdf|title=John Elkann|work=www.fcagroup.com |date=2017-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, after graduating in Engineering from [[Politecnico di Torino]], he joined General Electric's Corporate Audit program. He left General Electric two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.repubblica.it/2004/e/sezioni/economia/agnumb/schedaelkann/schedaelkann.html |title= Elkann nel Cda Fiat a 22 anni |newspaper= La Repubblica |date= 8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved back to Turin to be closer to his ageing grandfather, as well as be closer to the family business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mastersofscale.com/john-elkann-how-to-build-your-company-to-last/|title=John Elkann: How to build a company to last {{!}} Masters of Scale podcast|work=WaitWhat|access-date=2018-03-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''management accounting''' or '''managerial accounting,''' managers use the provisions of [[accounting]] information in order to better inform themselves before they decide matters within their organizations, which aids their management and performance of control functions.

==Definition==
[[Image:IFAC Definition of MA.jpg|thumb|450px|IFAC Definition of enterprise financial management concerning three broad areas: cost accounting; performance evaluation and analysis; planning and decision support. Managerial accounting is associated with  higher value, more predictive information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Evaluating and Improving Costing in Organizations (International Good Practice Guidance) |author=Professional Accountants in Business Committee |publisher=International Federation of Accountants |year=2009 |page=7 c|isbn=9781608150373 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Copyright July 2009, International Federation of Accountants'']]
One simple definition of management accounting is the provision of financial and non-financial decision-making information to managers.&lt;ref&gt;(Burns, Quinn, Warren &amp; Oliveira, ''Management Accounting'', McGraw-Hill, London, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Institute of Management Accountants]] (IMA): "Management accounting is a profession that involves partnering in management decision making, devising planning and performance management systems, and providing expertise in financial reporting and control to assist management in the formulation and implementation of an organization's strategy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of Management Accounting |publisher=Institute of Management Accountants |year=2008 |url=http://www.imanet.org/PDFs/Public/Research/SMA/Definition%20of%20Mangement%20Accounting.pdf |accessdate=4 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020120432/http://www.imanet.org/PDFs/Public/Research/SMA/Definition%20of%20Mangement%20Accounting.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Management accountants (also called managerial accountants) look at the events that happen in and around a business while considering the needs of the business. From this, data and estimates emerge. Cost accounting is the process of translating these estimates and data into knowledge that will ultimately be used to guide decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myaccountingcourse.com/accounting-dictionary/management-accounting|title=What is Management Accounting? - Definition - Meaning - Example|author=|date=|website=myaccountingcourse.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006162414/https://www.myaccountingcourse.com/accounting-dictionary/management-accounting|archivedate=6 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), the largest management accounting institute with over 100,000 members describes "Management accounting as analysing information to advise business strategy and drive sustainable business success".

==Scope, practice, and application==
The Association of International Certified Professional Accountants (AICPA) states that management accounting as practice extends to the following three areas:
* [[Strategic management]] — advancing the role of the management accountant as a strategic partner in the organization
* [[Performance management]] — developing the practice of business decision-making and managing the performance of the organization
* [[Risk management]] — contributing to frameworks and practices for identifying, measuring, managing and reporting risks to the achievement of the objectives of the organization

The Institute of Certified Management Accountants (CMA) states, "A management accountant applies his or her professional knowledge and skill in the preparation and presentation of financial and other decision oriented information in such a way as to assist management in the formulation of policies and in the planning and control of the operation of the undertaking".

Management accountants are seen as the "value-creators" amongst the accountants. They are more concerned with forward looking and taking decisions that will affect the future of the organization, than in the historical recording and compliance (score keeping) aspects of the profession. Management accounting knowledge and experience can be obtained from varied fields and functions within an organization, such as information management, treasury, efficiency auditing, marketing, valuation, pricing and logistics. In 2014 CIMA created the Global Management Accounting Principles (GMAPs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgma.org/Resources/Reports/Pages/GlobalManagementAccountingPrinciples.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423144019/http://www.cgma.org/Resources/Reports/Pages/GlobalManagementAccountingPrinciples.aspx |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of research from across 20 countries in five continents, the principles aim to guide best practice in the discipline.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=I.|title=New set of accounting principles can help drive sustainable success|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0b595a98-59fa-11e4-8771-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk#axzz3Q8Lp1OP9|publisher=ft.com|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between financial accountancy and management accounting==
{{Refimprove|date=March 2017}}
Management accounting information differs from [[financial accountancy]] information in several ways:
* while shareholders, creditors, and public regulators use publicly reported financial accountancy, information, only managers within the organization use the normally confidential management accounting information
* while financial accountancy information is historical, management accounting information is primarily forward-looking;
* while financial accountancy information is case-based, management accounting information is model-based with a degree of abstraction in order to support generic decision making;
* while financial accountancy information is computed by reference to general financial accounting standards, management accounting information is computed by reference to the needs of managers, often using [[management information system]]s.
Focus:  
* Financial accounting focuses on the company as a whole.
* Management accounting provides detailed and disaggregated information about products, individual activities, divisions, plants, operations and tasks.

==Traditional versus innovative practices==
[[Image:Managerial Costing Timeline.jpg|thumb|left|500px|Managerial costing time line&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Presentation at IMA's annual conference - Managerial Costing Conceptual Framework Session |first=Anton |last=van der Merwe |date=7 September 2011 |place=Orlando, FL |publisher=Unpublished}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Used with permission by the author A. van der Merwe. Copyright 2011. All Rights Reserved.'']]

The distinction between '''traditional''' and '''innovative''' accounting practices is illustrated with the visual timeline ''(see sidebar)'' of managerial costing approaches presented at the [[Institute of Management Accountants]] 2011 Annual Conference.

[[Traditional standard costing]] (TSC), used in [[cost accounting]], dates back to the 1920s and is a central method in management accounting practiced today because it is used for financial statement reporting for the valuation of income statement and balance sheet line items such as [[cost of goods sold]] (COGS) and inventory valuation.  Traditional [[standard costing]] must comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP US) and actually aligns itself more with answering financial accounting requirements rather than providing solutions for management accountants.  Traditional approaches limit themselves by defining cost behavior only in terms of production or sales volume.

In the late 1980s, accounting practitioners and educators were heavily criticized on the grounds that management accounting practices (and, even more so, the curriculum taught to accounting students) had changed little over the preceding 60 years, despite radical changes in the business environment. In 1993, the Accounting Education Change Commission Statement Number 4&lt;ref name=AECC&gt;{{cite web|title=Positions and Issues|url=http://www.aaahq.org/AECC/PositionsandIssues/issues4.htm|work=Issues Statement Number 4: Improving the Early Employment Experience of Accountants|publisher=American Accounting Association|accessdate=2 November 2011|author=Accounting Education Change Commission|location=Sarasota, FL|year=1993|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427214402/http://aaahq.org/AECC/PositionsandIssues/issues4.htm|archivedate=27 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; calls for faculty members to expand their knowledge about the actual practice of accounting in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Clinton, B.D. |author2=Matuszewski, L. |author3=Tidrick, D. |title=Escaping Professional Dominance?|journal=Cost Management|year=2011|issue=Sep/Oct|publisher=Thomas Reuters RIA Group|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional accounting institutes, perhaps fearing that management accountants would increasingly be seen as superfluous in business organizations, subsequently devoted considerable resources to the development of a more innovative skills set for management accountants.

[[Variance (accounting)|Variance analysis]] is a systematic approach to the comparison of the actual and budgeted costs of the raw materials and labour used during a production period.  While some form of variance analysis is still used by most manufacturing firms, it nowadays tends to be used in conjunction with innovative techniques such as ''[[Whole-life cost|life cycle cost analysis]]'' and ''activity-based costing'', which are designed with specific aspects of the modern business environment in mind. ''Life-cycle costing'' recognizes that managers' ability to influence the cost of manufacturing a product is at its greatest when the product is still at the design stage of its product life-cycle (i.e., before the design has been finalized and production commenced), since small changes to the product design may lead to significant savings in the cost of manufacturing the products.

[[Activity-based costing]] (ABC) recognizes that, in modern factories, most manufacturing costs are determined by the amount of 'activities' (e.g., the number of production runs per month, and the amount of production equipment idle time) and that the key to effective cost control is therefore optimizing the efficiency of these activities.  Both lifecycle costing and activity-based costing recognize that, in the typical modern factory, the avoidance of disruptive events (such as machine breakdowns and quality control failures) is of far greater importance than (for example) reducing the costs of raw materials. Activity-based costing also de-emphasizes direct labor as a cost driver and concentrates instead on activities that drive costs, as the provision of a service or the production of a product component.

Other approach is the German [[Grenzplankostenrechnung]] (GPK) costing methodology. Although it has been in practiced in Europe for more than 50 years, neither GPK nor the proper treatment of 'unused capacity' is widely practiced in the U.S.&lt;ref name=MA_ATMP&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Clinton, B.D. |author2=Van der Merwe, Anton |title=Management Accounting - Approaches, Techniques, and Management Processes|journal=Cost Management|year=2006|issue=May/Jun|publisher=Thomas Reuters RIA Group|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another accounting practice available today is [[resource consumption accounting]] (RCA).  RCA has been recognized by the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC) as a "sophisticated approach at the upper levels of the continuum of costing techniques"&lt;ref name=IGPG_Eval&gt;{{cite journal|author=Professional Accountants In Business Committee|title=International Good Practice Guidance: Evaluating and Improving Costing in Organizations|url=http://www.ifac.org/publications-resources/evaluating-and-improving-costing-organizations-0|date=July 2009|accessdate=10 November 2011|page=24|publisher=International Federation of Accountants|location=New York|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404144149/http://www.ifac.org/publications-resources/evaluating-and-improving-costing-organizations-0|archivedate=4 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach provides the ability to derive costs directly from operational resource data or to isolate and measure unused capacity costs.  RCA was derived by taking costing characteristics of GPK, and combining the use of activity-based drivers when needed, such as those used in activity-based costing.&lt;ref name=IGPG_Eval /&gt;

A modern approach to close accounting is continuous accounting, which focuses on achieving a point-in-time close, where accounting processes typically performed at period-end are distributed evenly throughout the period.

==Role within a corporation==
Consistent with other roles in modern corporations, management accountants have a dual reporting relationship. As a strategic partner and provider of decision based financial and operational information, management accountants are responsible for managing the business team and at the same time having to report relationships and responsibilities to the corporation's finance organization and finance of an organization.

The activities management accountants provide inclusive of forecasting and planning, performing variance analysis, reviewing and monitoring costs inherent in the business are ones that have dual accountability to both finance and the business team. Examples of tasks where accountability may be more meaningful to the business management team vs. the corporate finance department are the development of new product costing, [[operations research]], business driver metrics, sales management scorecarding, and client profitability analysis. (See [[financial modeling]].) Conversely, the preparation of certain financial reports, reconciliations of the financial data to source systems, risk and regulatory reporting will be more useful to the corporate finance team as they are charged with aggregating certain financial information from all segments of the corporation.

In corporations that derive much of their profits from the [[information economy]], such as banks, publishing houses, telecommunications companies and defence contractors, IT costs are a significant source of uncontrollable spending, which in size is often the greatest corporate cost after total compensation costs and property related costs. A function of management accounting in such organizations is to work closely with the IT department to provide [[IT cost transparency]].&lt;ref&gt;* "Taking Control of IT Costs". Nokes, Sebastian. London (Financial Times / Prentice Hall): March 20, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-273-64943-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the above, one view of the progression of the accounting and finance career path is that financial accounting is a stepping stone to management accounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cima P1 Exam Questions|url=http://www.cimapastpapers.com/how-to-pass-cima-p1-exam|accessdate=14 Nov 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114235651/http://www.cimapastpapers.com/how-to-pass-cima-p1-exam|archivedate=2016-11-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the notion of value creation, management accountants help drive the success of the business while strict financial accounting is more of a compliance and historical endeavor.

==Specific methodologies==

===Activity-based costing (ABC)===
Activity-based costing was first clearly defined in 1987 by Robert S. Kaplan and W. Bruns as a chapter in their book Accounting and Management: A Field Study Perspective. They initially focused on the manufacturing industry, where increasing technology and productivity improvements have reduced the relative proportion of the direct costs of labor and materials, but have increased relative proportion of indirect costs. For example, increased automation has reduced labor, which is a direct cost, but has increased depreciation, which is an indirect cost.

===Grenzplankostenrechnung (GPK)===
{{Undue weight section|date=August 2018}}
{{main article|Grenzplankostenrechnung (GPK)}}
Grenzplankostenrechnung is a German costing methodology, developed in the late 1940s and 1960s, designed to provide a consistent and accurate application of how managerial costs are calculated and assigned to a product or service. The term Grenzplankostenrechnung, often referred to as GPK, has best been translated as either ''marginal planned cost accounting''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedl|first=Gunther|author2=Hans-Ulrich Kupper |author3= Burkhard Pedell|title=Relevance Added: Combining ABC with German Cost Accounting|journal=Strategic Finance|issue=June|pages=56–61|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''flexible analytic cost planning and accounting''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharman|first=Paul A.|title=Bring On German Cost Accounting|journal=Strategic Finance|issue=December|pages=2–9|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of GPK are credited to Hans Georg Plaut, an automotive engineer, and Wolfgang Kilger, an academic, working towards the mutual goal of identifying and delivering a sustained methodology designed to correct and enhance cost accounting information. GPK is published in cost accounting textbooks, notably ''Flexible Plankostenrechnung und Deckungsbeitragsrechnung''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kilger|first=Wolfgang|others=Updated by Kurt Vikas and Jochen Pampel|title=Flexible Plankostenrechnung and Deckungsbeitragsrechnung|edition=12th|publisher=Gabler GmbH|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught at German-speaking universities.

===Lean accounting (accounting for lean enterprise)===
{{main article|Lean accounting}}
In the mid- to late-1990s several books were written about accounting in the lean enterprise (companies implementing elements of the [[Toyota Production System]]). The term ''lean accounting'' was coined during that period. These books contest that traditional accounting methods are better suited for mass production and do not support or measure good business practices in just-in-time manufacturing and services. The movement reached a tipping point during the 2005 Lean Accounting Summit in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], [[Michigan]], United States. 320 individuals attended and discussed the advantages of a new approach to accounting in the lean enterprise. 520 individuals attended the 2nd annual conference in 2006 and it has varied between 250 and 600 attendees since that time.

===Resource consumption accounting (RCA)===
{{main article|Resource Consumption Accounting}}
Resource consumption accounting (RCA) is formally defined as a dynamic, fully integrated, principle-based, and comprehensive management accounting approach that provides managers with decision support information for enterprise optimization. RCA emerged as a management accounting approach around 2000 and was subsequently developed at CAM-I,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.CAM-I.org|title=Consortium for Advanced Management International CAM-I|author=|date=|website=www.cam-i.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007163858/http://www.cam-i.org/|archivedate=7 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Consortium for Advanced Manufacturing–International, in a Cost Management Section ''RCA interest group''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam-i.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=30 Cost Management Section ''RCA interest group''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207190442/http://www.cam-i.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=30 |date=2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2001.

===Throughput accounting===
{{main article|Throughput accounting}}
The most significant recent direction in managerial accounting is throughput accounting; which recognizes the interdependencies of modern production processes. For any given product, customer or supplier, it is a tool to measure the contribution per unit of constrained resource.

===Transfer pricing===
{{main article|Transfer pricing}}
Management accounting is an applied discipline used in various industries. The specific functions and principles followed can vary based on the industry. Management accounting principles in banking are specialized but do have some common fundamental concepts used whether the industry is manufacturing-based or service-oriented. For example, transfer pricing is a concept used in manufacturing but is also applied in banking. It is a fundamental principle used in assigning value and revenue attribution to the various business units. Essentially, transfer pricing in banking is the method of assigning the interest rate risk of the bank to the various funding sources and uses of the enterprise. Thus, the bank's corporate treasury department will assign funding charges to the business units for their use of the bank's resources when they make loans to clients. The treasury department will also assign funding credit to business units who bring in deposits (resources) to the bank. Although the [[funds transfer pricing]] process is primarily applicable to the loans and deposits of the various banking units, this proactive is applied to all assets and liabilities of the business segment. Once transfer pricing is applied and any other management accounting entries or adjustments are posted to the ledger (which are usually memo accounts and are not included in the legal entity results), the business units are able to produce segment financial results which are used by both internal and external users to evaluate performance.

==Resources and continuous learning==
There are a variety of ways to keep current and continue to build one's knowledge base in the field of management accounting. [[Certified Management Accountants]] (CMAs) are required to achieve continuing education hours every year, similar to a Certified Public Accountant. A company may also have research and training materials available for use in a corporate owned library. This is more common in [[Fortune 500]] companies who have the resources to fund this type of training medium.

There are also journals, online articles and blogs available.  The journal ''Cost Management'' ({{ISSN|1092-8057}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ria.thomsonreuters.com/estore/printdetail.aspx?ID=ZMCMP |title=Cost Management |publisher=Thomson Reuters |year=2011 |accessdate=November 12, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421063935/http://ria.thomsonreuters.com/estore/printdetail.aspx?ID=ZMCMP |archivedate=April 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Institute of Management Accounting (IMA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imanet.org/publications_maq.asp Institute of Management Accounting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207160120/http://www.imanet.org/publications_maq.asp |date=2007-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; site are sources which include ''[[Management Accounting Quarterly]]'' and ''Strategic Finance'' publications.

'''Martin Kratochvíl''' (born May 22, 1946 in [[Prague]]) is a [[jazz]] and [[jazz rock]] musician and a businessman from former [[Czechoslovakia]], now [[Czech Republic]]. 

In 1964 he co-founded the [[jazz band]] [[Jazz Q]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muzikus.cz/publicistika/Martin-Kratochvil-Hudebni-hodokvas-s-Jazz-Q~16~leden~2008/ "Martin Kratochvíl - Hudební hodokvas s Jazz Q"] {{cs icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a successful musician both in the former communist country and abroad, he amassed enough money so that when the communist regime was liquidated, he became a successful businessman, an owner of an [[airport]], several factories and other investments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.radio.cz/listings/jazz.html  "Jazz Music Groups of the Czech Republic"], archive of the Czech Radio&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 he founded a [[record label]] [[Bonton Music|Bonton]]. In January 1992 he became a board member of the investment privatization fund TREND.&lt;ref&gt;Commercial register at justice.cz, Identification number (IČO) 45245177&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microdispensing''' is the technique of producing liquid media dosages in volumes of less than one microlitre. The continuing miniaturization in almost all technical areas creates constant challenges for industry, development and research facilities. Microdispensing is one of those challenges. Ever smaller amounts of adhesive, liquid, oil, grease and a multitude of other media must be dispensed reliably and accurately in dosage and placement with short cycle times.  The precise positioning and quantity of fluids such as glue, reagents or any other substance has a great influence on the overall quality of a medical device. A few examples are:
* Micro-dosing systems with a quantity as small as 50 picolitres
* Volumetric systems for use with adhesives and spraying systems for silicone coating needles and other surfaces

Microdispensing is also used in non-medical applications, like on-demand soda flavoring (the [[Coca-Cola Freestyle]] and [[Pepsi Spire]]), [[inkjet printing]], and [[3-D printing]].

==Dispensing techniques==
There are two basic types of dispensing techniques: classic contact dispensing and non-contact dispensing.

===Contact dispensing===
In contact dispensing, the drop forms at the exit of a nozzle, and is deposited by contact, while the drop is still on the nozzle. The technique is as old as the wish to divide a medium, stored in a big container, into smaller amounts. A good example for this is applying adhesive with a tube: To apply the adhesive requires contact between the tip of the tube and the part for the bead of adhesive to be transferred. This method has disadvantages:
* Slow dispensing
* Part has to be touched
* Part could be damaged
* Adhesive forms threads
* Adhesive is not in the expected place
* Adhesive amounts are difficult to reproduce

Despite all of these disadvantages, contact dispensing is still used in the majority of automated processes today, because  of:
* A lack of knowledge regarding non-contact dispensing systems
* Few manufacturers for non-contact dispensing systems
* No direct access to dispensing area (e.g. undercuts)
* Medium can not be dispensed without contact
* Dispensing without stress to Medium is possible
* More precise dispensing especially at bead dispensing
* Simple to clean in most cases

===Typical technologies for contact dispensing===
Gear pump
* high-frequency pulsation
* high performance
* always valves
* no solids possible 
Pressure-time systems
* many components
* pragmatic evaluation of quantity and control
* add. power source: air
* volume flow depends on pressure, time and temperature

===Non-contact dispensing (Jetting)===

In non-contact dispensing, the drop also forms at the end of a nozzle, but far enough away from the target area that the drop separates from the nozzle before it hits. This, too, is a very old technique, as old as squirting liquid from a tube.

Because of increasing requirements in regards to cycle time and accuracy in almost all areas of production, non-contact dispensing is constantly gaining importance. A good example for this is the attachment of very small electronic parts (SMD parts) onto printed circuit boards and substrates. For this, the part carrier only needs to be positioned in one plane - after that the adhesive can be transferred without contact. The following examples show the advantages of non-contact dispensing:
* Removal of a feed motion to the part
* Time saving through ejection of adhesive
* No contact with part (no damage)
* Even spread of adhesive topography independent of part topography and surface structure

Non-contact dispensing can be divided in two different methods:
* Jet-forming dispensing
* Dynamic drop dispensing

==Jet-forming dispensing==
&lt;br /&gt;Jet-forming dispensing exists when the flow velocity of a medium at the nozzle exit is high enough that the effects of gravitation and surface tension on the separation of the fluid from the nozzle are of secondary importance. This state is characterized by the [[Weber number]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{We} = \frac{\rho v^2 D}{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

where
{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;||: Fluid [[density]] ([[kilogram|kg]]/[[meter|m]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;||: Jet [[velocity]] (m/[[second|s]])
|-
|&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;||: Nozzle diameter (m)
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;||: [[Surface tension]] ([[newton (unit)|N]]/m)
|}
The physical border line between drop- and jet-forming is around a Weber-number of 8. At this point the dynamic pressure of the flowing medium exceeds the pressure from the surface tension of the drop, which therefore sticks to the nozzle. This transitional stage can be demonstrated at a water tap by gradually increasing the flow, going from the dropping status until a continuous water jet has formed. The Weber-number in this case is, however, clearly above 8, because of the jet exit conditions of the nozzle.

By using the Weber-number, the theoretical lower limit of the mass flow can be found for the jet-forming conditions. In actual applications, to assure a safe dispensing process, the real Weber-numbers chosen should be between 20 and 50.

For a calculated estimation of the fluid flow velocity in the nozzle, for fluids with Newtonian flow behavior, the formula for capillary fluid flow according to the [[Hagen–Poiseuille law]] has been proven.

:&lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{\Delta P \pi r^4}{8 \mu L}&lt;/math&gt;
{|
|&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;||: Volumetric flow rate
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Delta P&lt;/math&gt;||: Pressure difference between nozzle entrance and nozzle exit
|-
|&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;||: Nozzle radius
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;||: Dynamic viscosity
|-
|&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;||: Length of the nozzle
|}
To avoid atomizing of the fluid at the nozzle exit, the fluid flow in the nozzle must be laminar, which is the case as long as the [[Reynolds number]] (Re) of the nozzle is smaller than the [[Reynolds number#Transition and turbulent flow|critical Reynolds-number]] of the nozzle:

: &lt;math&gt;Re &lt; Re_{crit}&lt;/math&gt;

Reynolds-number of the nozzle:
: &lt;math&gt; Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;
{|
|&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;||: Dynamic viscosity
|}

Critical Reynolds-number of the nozzle:
: &lt;math&gt;1800 \lessapprox Re_{crit} \lessapprox 2400&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the theoretical range of the jet-forming dispension is enclosed at its lower limit by the Weber-number and at its upper limit by the critical Reynolds-number. For practical applications, a high kinetic energy in the fluid jet is not desirable, because the jet probably would burst and spatter tiny droplets around the target point. Jet-forming dispensing systems are therefore usually operated in the area of lower Weber-numbers.

In practice, the calculation of the Weber-number becomes more complicated when fluids with additives are used, which demonstrate a non-Newtonian (i.e. thixotropic) flow behavior and therefore the viscosity during the flow through the nozzle is different.

==Dynamic drop dispensing==
&lt;br&gt;Dynamic drop dispensing is characterised by separation of a drop from the nozzle exit through a dynamic process, because the static pressure of the liquid medium is insufficient for forming a fluid jet.

A well-known example is [[inkjet printing]]. In this application, the volume of a small dispensing chamber with adjoining nozzle becomes reduced through a short impulse, whereby the ink is ejected through the nozzle. Nozzle chamber, nozzle and ink reservoir are hereby fluidically connected without any valve in between. During the dispensing process, some of the medium is also flowing in the reverse direction (back into the reservoir). The surface tension of the fluid at the nozzle exit prevents air being sucked in and fluid from exiting the nozzle when the dispensing chamber is filled up again. The principle of this process is only useful for low-viscosity fluids and this principle is not applicable with higher fluid pressures.

Ink-jet systems have the following inherent properties:

•	Very small single-drop volumes are achievable (8 picolitres)&lt;br /&gt;
•	High dispensing frequencies can be realised (some kHz)&lt;br /&gt;
•	Low costs for mass production&lt;br /&gt;
•	Only certain low-viscosity media are dispensable (i.e. no volatile media)&lt;br /&gt;
•	Principally not leak-proof

For industrial production, the dispensing amounts and the range of viscosity spectra of ink-jet systems for most applications are too small.&lt;!--I'm just guessing at what this originally nonsensical sentence was supposed to mean --&gt; In these fields of production, specially-designed valves with tappet drives of high dynamic are used instead. These microdispensing systems are characterised by the following properties:

•	Single drop volumes from 10 to 200 nanolitres&lt;br /&gt;
•	Dispensing frequencies up to 100&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;br /&gt;
•	Dispensing accuracy &lt; 1%&lt;br /&gt;
•	Media viscosities up to 200 Pa·s (thixotropic)&lt;!-- originally "200.000 mPas" which I took to mean 200000 milli-Pascal-seconds since the source appears to be European --&gt;

'''Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden''' ({{lang-ar|محمد بن عوض بن لادن}}; 1908 – 3 September 1967) was a multi-millionaire Saudi businessman working primarily in the [[construction industry]].  He founded what is today the [[Saudi Binladin Group]] and became the wealthiest non-royal Saudi, establishing the wealth and prestige of the [[Bin Laden family]].  He was the father of [[Osama bin Laden]].

==Life==
Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden was born on the [[Hadhramaut]] coast of south [[Yemen]] in 1908 to Awad bin Aboud bin Laden, a [[Kindah|Kindite]] [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]] tribesman from al-Rubat, a village in Wadi Doan; Mohammed's paternal grandfather was Aboud bin Laden, the son of Ali bin Laden, one of four brothers (the others being Ahmed, Mansour, and Zaid) from whom the four [[bin Laden family|bin Laden]] clans trace their ancestry. His son [[Osama bin Laden]] was the notorious founder of [[al-Qaeda]], the [[Sunni]] [[militant Islamist]] organization.

Poor and uneducated, Mohammed emigrated to [[Tihamah]] before [[World War I]], initially working as a porter in [[Jeddah]]. In 1930, he started his own construction business and after coming to the attention of [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud]], first monarch of [[Saudi Arabia]], he eventually achieved such success that his family became known as "the wealthiest non-royal family in the kingdom."

Mohammed bin Laden's enormous financial success was ascribed to a shrewd business sense, fealty to Saudi Arabia's rulers, reliability and a willingness to offer the lowest bid on construction contracts.

As the "royal builder," Mohammed bin Laden forged close relationships with the royal family, particularly [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Prince Faisal]] of Saudi Arabia. In 1964, Prince Faisal deposed his half-brother, [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Saud]], and began rebuilding the kingdom after the wasteful excesses of the Saud era. King Faisal accepted Mohammed bin Laden's offer of financial assistance to support the national economy and as a reward, King Faisal issued a royal decree awarding all future construction projects to bin Laden's construction company. As a result, bin Laden's company eventually amassed assets in excess of US$5 billion.
He made his initial fortune from exclusive rights to all mosque and other religious building construction in Saudi Arabia and several other Arab countries.  Until 1967, Mohammed bin Laden held exclusive responsibility for restorations at the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in [[Jerusalem]].

Despite his royal associations and great wealth, Mohammed bin Laden lived a relatively simple and devout life compared to many wealthy Saudis, demanding that his children observe a strict religious and moral code.  In his later years, the bin Laden corporate network diversified its activities beyond construction, largely in foreign investment and oil.

== Wives and children ==
He fathered a total of 56 children by 22 wives. Mohammed never had more than four wives at a time—divorcing older wives and marrying new ones as needed to limit the number of current wives to four and stay within the letter of [[Polygyny in Islam|Sunni Islam marriage law]]. According to [[Carmen bin Ladin]], Mohammed was planning to wed a 23rd wife the night he died, and was heading there when his plane crashed.&lt;ref name=CBLpp65-66&gt;{{Citation

Osama bin Ladin’s mother, [[Hamida al-Attas]], was born and raised in Syria before marrying Bin Laden and moving to Saudi Arabia. She was Mohammed’s 11th wife.

== Death ==
On 3 September 1967, Mohammed bin Laden was killed when his company airplane, a [[Beechcraft]], crashed during landing in Oom, [['Asir Province]], in southwest Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;The Bin Ladens – Steve Coll (Penguin, 2008), pp. 118–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Following Mohammed bin Laden's death, his eldest sons, principally [[Salem bin Laden]], renamed the organization, "Binladen Brothers for Contracting and Industry" and continued to expand their late father's company until it employed more than 40,000 people. Salem bin Laden was killed in the United States in 1988 when his ultralight aircraft collided with power lines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rags to riches story of the bin Laden family is woven with tragedy|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/01/rags-to-riches-story-of-the-bin-laden-family-is-woven-with-tragedy|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-06|first = Jason|last = Burke}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of the Bin Laden family have moved away from Saudi Arabia and settled in Europe and the US.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In May 1990, the company was renamed the Saudi Binladin Group under the leadership of [[Bakr bin Laden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden|url = http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=mohammed_bin_awad_bin_laden_1|website = www.historycommons.org|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Saudi Binladin Group]] as it is now known, is involved in construction, engineering, manufacturing, and telecommunications. Construction projects include airports, housing complexes, tunnels, and bridges. The group is also involved in city planning and real estate development. The Saudi Binladin Group is Egypt's largest private foreign company and negotiated with the Lebanese government to rebuild part of central Beirut under a US $50 million contract.

In 2009, the Bin Laden family was listed as the 5th wealthiest Saudi family by [[Forbes|Forbes magazine]], with a reported net worth of $7 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Five Richest Saudis|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2009/08/31/the-five-richest-saudis/|website = WSJ Blogs - The Wealth Report|date = 2009-08-31|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nevenka Bečić''' (born March 5, 1958 in Radunić (near [[Muć]]), [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]]) is a [[Croatia]]n [[entrepreneur]] and [[politician]]. She was president of the [[Split (city)|Split]] city council from 2009 to 2013 and a member of the Croatian parliament. She is mostly recognized as the sister of [[Željko Kerum]] and his right hand when it comes to politics and business.&lt;ref name="'sabor.hr"&gt;http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?sec=4984/&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevenka Bečić graduated from the high school of economy in [[Split (city)|Split]]. She joined her brother [[Željko Kerum]] and worked on expanding his company ''Kerum'', a major supermarket chain in [[Croatia]]. She became second in the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] and was credited for the company's success over the years. Her brother attracted the public spotlight with his lifestyle while she was always in the shadows.

In 2009, Kerum and Bečić decided to run in the Split local elections. Kerum won the [[Split local elections, 2009]] and became mayor of Split. He appointed Bečić in October 2009 as president of the Split city council.&lt;ref name="'index.hr"&gt;http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/kerumovi-zavladali-splitom-sestra-nevenka-zasjela-u-fotelju-predsjednice-gradskog-vijeca/455172.aspx/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, she and her brother Željko Kerum became candidates in the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2011]] on the electoral list of the [[Croatian Democratic Union]]. They managed both to get in the parliament but remained in opposition to the winning [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.poslovni.hr/vijesti/hdz-predao-izborne-liste-kosor-prva-u-petoj-jedinici-190541.aspx | language = Croatian | title = HDZ predao izborne liste, Kosor prva u petoj jedinici | newspaper = [[Poslovni dnevnik]] | date = 2011-11-14 | accessdate = 2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Croatian local elections, 2013]] Kerum won only 18.57% of the popular vote while re-running for mayor, which did not qualify him to the second round of the elections. Also, Kerum's and Bečić's [[Croatian Civic Party]] won only 12.41% of the popular votes for the city council of Split. Bečić failed to win the 2013 county presidential elections in the [[Split-Dalmatia County]] and finished 3rd. She managed to become a member of the Split-Dalmatia assembly nevertheless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/bandic-pobjednik-kerum-porazen-milanovic-ponizen/678557.aspx | title = Bandić pobjednik, Kerum poražen, Milanović ponižen | language = Croatian | date = 20 May 2013 | accessdate = 4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2015]], the Croatian civic party won only 2234 votes in the two Dalmatian constituencies and resulted in losing the parliament seat for Kerum and Bečić.

==Company==
His father thought he was reading too much, so he said to his son that he should go and play tennis. Pieter listened to the advice of his father, but he generally saw the economical aspect of tennis. He borrowed money from his family and built a tennis court near Kralingen with it.

Later on, Pieter had the idea to sell his tennis court and start a sport store "Sporthuis-centrum" or translated to English "Sporthouse-centre". He bought a tent factory in North Brabant. Due to the increase of economical welfare the public's demand for bigger and better tents was increasing. Pieter came to the idea to rent full accommodated tents on a piece of land near Reuver. This was a great success, so the tents were rapidly replaced by bungalows. In 1978 Pieter decided to sell his sports store concern. He did this so he could fully concentrate himself on the company "Sporthuis Centrum".[2] He even built a house for himself on park "De Kempervennen" near Eindhoven. He did this because he believed it was better to see your company work, and also to stay closer to your customers

'''Policy analysis''' is a technique used in [[public administration]] to enable [[civil servant]]s, [[Activism|activists]], and others to examine and evaluate the available options to implement the goals of laws and elected officials. The process is also used in the administration of large organizations with complex policies. It has been defined as the process of "determining which of various [[Policy|policies]] will achieve a given set of goals in light of the relations between the policies and the goals."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s.

==Approaches==
Various approaches to policy analysis exist. The analysis ''for'' policy (and analysis ''of'' policy) is the central approach in [[social science]] and educational policy studies. It is linked to two different traditions of policy analysis and research frameworks. The approach of analysis ''for'' policy refers to research conducted for actual policy development, often commissioned by policymakers inside the bureaucracy (e.g., senior civil servants) within which the policy is developed. Analysis ''of'' policy is more of an academic exercise, conducted by academic researchers, professors and [[think tank]] researchers, who are often seeking to understand why a particular policy was developed at a particular time and assess the effects, intended or otherwise, of that policy when it was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Khorsandi Taskoh, Ali. [http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3340&amp;context=etd A Critical Policy Analysis of Internationalization in Postsecondary Education: An Ontario Case Study], ''The University of Western Ontario'', October 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three approaches that can be distinguished: the analysis-centric, the policy process, and the meta-policy approach.&lt;ref name="Bührs93"/&gt;

===Analysis-centric===
The analysis-centric (or "analycentric") approach focuses on individual problems and their solutions. Its scope is the micro-scale and its problem interpretation or problem resolution usually involves a technical solution. The primary aim is to identify the most effective and efficient solution in technical and economic terms (e.g. the most efficient allocation of resources).

===Policy process===
The policy process approach puts its focal point onto political processes and involved [[stakeholder analysis|stakeholders]]; its scope is the broader meso-scale and it interprets problems using a political lens (i.e., the interests and goals of elected officials). It aims at determining what processes, means and policy instruments (e.g., [[regulation]], [[legislation]], [[subsidy]]) are used. As well, it tries to explain the role and influence of stakeholders within the policy process &lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2015).  Making policy connections across scales using nexus analysis. In F.M. Hult &amp; D.C Johnson (Eds.), &lt;i&gt;Research methods in language policy and planning: A practical guide&lt;/i&gt; (pp. 217-231). Malden, MA: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;. In the 2010s, ''stakeholders'' is defined broadly to include citizens, community groups, non-governmental organizations, businesses and even opposing political parties. By changing the relative power and influence of certain groups (e.g., enhancing public participation and consultation), solutions to problems may be identified that have more "buy in" from a wider group. One way of doing this followed a [[heuristic]] model called the ''[[Policy#Policy cycle|policy cycle]]''. In its simplest form, the policy cycle, which is often depicted visually as a loop or circle, starts with the identification of the problem, proceeds to an examination of the different policy tools that could be used to respond to that problem, then goes on to the implementation stage, in which one or more policies are put into practice (e.g., a new regulation or subsidy is set in place), and then finally, once the policy has been implemented and run for a certain period, the policy is evaluated. A number of different viewpoints can be used during evaluation, including looking at a policy's effectiveness, [[cost-effectiveness]], value for money, outcomes or outputs.

===Meta-policy===
The meta-policy approach is a systems and context approach; i.e., its scope is the macro-scale and its problem interpretation is usually of a structural nature. It aims at explaining the contextual factors of the policy process; i.e., what the political, economic and socio-cultural factors are that influence it. As problems may result because of structural factors (e.g., a certain economic system or political institution), solutions may entail changing the structure itself.

==Methodology==
Policy analysis uses both [[qualitative methods]] and [[quantitative methods]]. Qualitative research includes [[case studies]] and interviews with community members. Quantitative research includes [[survey research]], [[statistical analysis]] (also called ''data analysis'') and [[model building]]. A common practice is to define the problem and evaluation criteria; identify and evaluate alternatives; and recommend a certain policy accordingly. Promotion of the best agendas are the product of careful "back-room" analysis of policies by ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' assessment and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' evaluation.

===Dimensions for analyzing policies===
There are six dimensions to policy analysis categorized as the effects and implementation of the policy across a period of time. Also collectively known as "Durability" of the policy, which means the capacity in content of the policy to produce visible effective compatible change or results over time with robustness.&lt;ref&gt;Salamon, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Effects'''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Effectiveness''' || What effects does the policy have on the targeted problem?
|-
| '''Unintended effects'''&lt;ref&gt;Rychetnik et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt; || What are the [[unintended effects]] of this policy?
|-
| '''Equity'''&lt;ref&gt;Potvin et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; || What are the effects of this policy on different population groups?
|}

'''Implementation'''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Cost''' || What is the financial cost of this policy (some analysts also include [[tax credit]]s in this analysis)?
|-
| '''Feasibility''' || Is the policy technically feasible?
|-
| '''Acceptability'''&lt;ref&gt;Peters, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; || Do the relevant policy stakeholders view the policy as acceptable?
|}

The strategic effects dimensions can pose certain limitations due to data collection. However the analytical dimensions of effects directly influences acceptability. The degree of acceptability is based upon the plausible definitions of actors involved in feasibility. If the feasibility dimension is compromised, it will put the implementation at risk, which will entail additional costs. Finally, implementation dimensions collectively influence a policy's ability to produce results or impacts.

===Five-E approach===
One model of policy analysis is the "five-E approach", which consists of examining a policy in terms of:&lt;ref name="Kirst-Ashman"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bHQcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |series=Empowerment Series |title=Introduction to Social Work &amp; Social Welfare: Critical Thinking Perspectives |first=Karen K. |last=Kirst-Ashman |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=January 1, 2016 |pages=234–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Effectiveness: How well does it work (or how well will it be predicted to work)?
;Efficiency: How much work does or will it entail? Are there significant costs associated with this solution, and are they worth it?
;[[Ethics|Ethical]] considerations: Is it ethically and morally sound?  Are there [[unintended consequences]]?
;Evaluations of alternatives: How good is it compared to other approaches?  Have all the relevant other approaches been considered?
;Establishment of recommendations for positive change: What can actually be implemented? Is it better to amend, replace, remove, or add a policy?

===Framework===
Policies are considered as frameworks that can optimize the general well-being. These are commonly analyzed by legislative bodies and lobbyists. Every policy analysis is intended to bring an evaluative outcome. A systemic policy analysis is meant for in depth study for addressing a social problem. Following are steps in a policy analysis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jillian Jimenez|author2=Eileen Mayers Pasztor|author3=Ruth M. Chambers |author4=Cheryl Pearlman Fujii |title=Social Policy and Social Change: Toward the Creation of Social and Economic Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hU0XBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|date=2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4833-2415-9|pages=25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Defining the problem assessed by the policy.
# Assessing policy objectives and its target populations.
# Studying effects of the policy.
# Policy implications: distribution of resources, changes in services rights and statuses, tangible benefits. 
# Alternative policies: surveying existing and possible policy models that could have addressed the problem better or parts of it which could make it effective.

==Evidence based models==
Many models exist to analyze the development and implementation of [[public policy]]. Analysts use these models to identify important aspects of policy, as well as explain and predict policy and its consequences. Each of these models are based upon the types of policies.

===Types===
* Government (e.g. federal, provincial, municipal)
* Policies adopted within public institutions (e.g. hospitals, child care centers, schools)
* Workplace (e.g. policies that govern employees and employee-manager relations)&lt;ref&gt;Kim Bergeron, Florence Morestin et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidence supported models are:

===Governments===

Public policy is determined by a range of political institutions, which give policy [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] to policy measures. In general, the government applies policy to all citizens and monopolizes the use of force in applying or implementing policy (through government control of [[law enforcement]], [[court]] systems, [[imprisonment]] and [[armed forces]]). The [[legislature]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[judicial]] branches of government are examples of institutions that give policy legitimacy. Many countries also have independent, quasi-independent or [[arm's length]] bodies which, while funded by government, are independent from elected officials and political leaders. These organizations may include government [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]s, [[tribunal]]s, [[regulation|regulatory agencies]] and electoral commissions.

====Process model====
{{See also|Policy#Policy cycle|l1=Policy cycle}}

Policy creation is a process that typically follows a sequence of steps or stages:
* Identification of a problem (also called "problem definition") and demand for government action. Different stakeholders may define the same issue as different problems. For example, if [[homelessness|homeless people]] are using [[illegal drug]]s such as [[heroin]] in a city park, some stakeholders may define this as a [[law enforcement]] issue (which, in their view, could be best solved if police presence in the park is stepped up and if the individuals using illegal drugs are arrested and punished); on the other hand, other stakeholders may view this as a [[poverty]] and [[public health]] issue (which, in their view, could be best solved if [[public health nurse]]s and government [[medical doctor]]s and [[substance abuse]] counsellors were sent to the park to do [[outreach]] with the drug-using individuals, and encourage them to voluntarily enter "[[detoxification]]" or [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] programs).
* Agenda setting
* Formulation of policy proposals by various parties (e.g., citizen groups, congressional committees, [[think tank]]s, [[interest group]]s, [[lobby group]]s, [[non-governmental organization]]s).
* Policy selection/adoption and legal enactment of a selected policy by elected officials and/or houses of representatives. At this stage, '''policy legitimation''' is conferred upon the selected policy solution(s).
* Policy implementation, which involves [[civil servant]]s putting the selected policy option into practice. Depending on the choice made by the executive or legislative branch, this could involve creating new [[regulation]] (or [[Deregulation|removing existing regulations]]), creating new laws, creating a new government program or service, creating a new [[subsidy]] or [[grant (money)|grant]], etc.
* Policy [[evaluation]]. After the policy has been in place for a year or several years, [[civil servant]]s or an independent [[consulting firm]] assesses the policy, to see if the goals were achieved, if the policy was implemented effectively, etc.

This model, however, has been criticized for being overly linear and simplistic.&lt;ref&gt;Young, John and Enrique Mendizabal. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1127&amp;title=become-policy-entrepreneur-roma Helping researchers become policy entrepreneurs], [[Overseas Development Institute]], London, September 2009. &lt;!--accessed 07 October 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, stages of the policy process may overlap or never happen. Also, this model fails to take into account the multiple factors attempting to influence the process itself as well as each other, and the complexity this entails.

===For public institutions===

One of the most widely used model for public institutions are of [[Herbert A. Simon]], the father of rational models. It is also used by private corporations. However, many criticise the model due to characteristics of the model being impractical and relying on unrealistic assumptions. For instance, it is a difficult model to apply in the public sector because social problems can be very complex, ill-defined and interdependent. The problem lies in the thinking procedure implied by the model which is linear and can face difficulties in extraordinary problems or social problems which have no sequences of happenings.

====Rational model====
:''See [[Rational planning model]] for a fuller discussion''

The rational model of decision-making is a process for making sound decisions in policy-making in the public sector. Rationality is defined as “a style of behavior that is appropriate to the achievement of given goals, within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Herbert, Simon |title=[[Administrative Behavior]] |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |year=1976 |edition=3rd |isbn=0-684-83582-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note the model makes a series of assumptions, such as: 'The model must be applied in a system that is stable'; 'The government is a rational and unitary actor and that its actions are perceived as rational choices'; 'The policy problem is unambiguous'; 'There are no limitations of time or cost'.

Furthermore, in the context of the public sector policy models are intended to achieve maximum social gain. Simon identifies an outline of a step by step mode of analysis to achieve rational decisions. Ian Thomas describes Simon's steps as follows:

#Intelligence gathering — A comprehensive organization of data; potential problems and opportunities are identified, collected and analyzed.
#Identifying problems — Accounting for relevant factors.
#Assessing the consequences of all options — Listing possible consequences and alternatives that could resolve the problem and ranking the probability that each potential factor could materialize in order to give a correct priority to said factor in the analysis.
#Relating consequences to values — With all policies there will be a set of relevant dimensional values (for example, economic feasibility and environmental protection) and a set of criteria for appropriateness, against which performance (or consequences) of each option being responsive can be judged.
#Choosing the preferred option — The policy is brought through from fully understanding the problems, opportunities, all the consequences &amp; the criteria of the tentative options and by selecting an optimal alternative with consensus of involved actors.&lt;ref name=Thomas07&gt;{{cite book |editor=Thomas, Ian |title=Environmental Policy: Australian Practice in the Context of Theory |publisher=Federation Press |location=Sydney |year=2007 |isbn=1-86287-603-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model of rational decision-making has also proven to be very useful to several decision making processes in industries outside the public sphere. Nonetheless, there are some who criticize the rational model due to the major problems which can be faced &amp; which tend to arise in practice because social and environmental values can be difficult to quantify and forge consensus around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1005469411776 |author1=Morgan M.G. |author2=Kandlikar M. |author3=Risbey J. |author4=Dowlatabadi H. |title=Why Conventional Tools for Policy Analysis Are Often Inadequate for Problems of Global Change |journal=Climatic Change |volume=41 |issue=3-4 |pages=271–281 |date=19 March 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the assumptions stated by Simon are never fully valid in a real world context.

Further criticism of the rational model include: leaving a gap between planning and implementation, ignoring of the role of people, entrepreneurs, leadership, etc., the insufficiency of technical competence (i.e. ignoring the human factor), reflecting too mechanical an approach (i.e. the organic nature of organizations), requiring of multidimensional and complex models, generation of predictions which are often wrong (i.e. simple solutions may be overlooked), &amp; incurring of cost (i.e. costs of rational-comprehensive planning may outweigh the cost savings of the policy).

However, Thomas R. Dye, the president of the Lincoln Center for Public Service, states the rational model provides a good perspective since in modern society rationality plays a central role and everything that is rational tends to be prized. Thus, it does not seem strange that “we ought to be trying for rational decision-making”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dye, Thomas R. |title=Understanding Public Policy |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=12th |year=2007 |isbn=0-13-936948-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Incremental policy====
{{More|Incrementalism}}
An incremental policy model relies on features of incremental decision-making such as: satisfying, organizational drift, bounded rationality, and limited cognition, among others. Such policies are often called "muddling through" &amp; represent a conservative tendency: new policies are only slightly different from old policies. Policy-makers are too short on time, resources, and brains to make totally new policies; as such, past policies are accepted as having some legitimacy. When existing policies have sunk costs which discourage innovation, incrementalism is an easier approach than rationalism, and the policies are more politically expedient because they don't necessitate any radical redistribution of values. Such models necessarily struggle to improve the acceptability of public policy.

Criticisms of such a policy approach include: challenges to bargaining (i.e. not successful with limited resources), downplaying useful quantitative information, obscuring real relationships between political entities, an anti-intellectual approach to problems (i.e. the preclusion of imagination), and a bias towards conservatism (i.e. bias against far-reaching solutions).

===For workplaces===
There are many contemporary policies relevant to gender and workplace issues. Actors analyze contemporary gender-related employment issues ranging from parental leave and maternity programs, sexual harassment, and work/life balance to gender mainstreaming. It is by the juxtaposition of a variety of research methodologies focused on a common theme the richness of understanding is gained. This integrates what are usually separate bodies of evaluation on the role of gender in welfare state developments, employment transformations, workplace policies, and work experience.

====Group model====
This policy is formed as a result of forces and pressures from influential groups. Pressure groups are informally co-opted into the policy making process. Regulatory agencies are captured by those they are supposed to regulate. No one group is dominant all the time on all issues. The group is the bridge between the individual and the administration. The executive is thus pressured by interest groups.

The task of the system is to:
* Establish the rules of the game
* Arrange compromises and balance interests
* Enact compromises in policy
* Enforce these compromises.

==Evaluation==
The success of a policy can be measured by changes in the behavior of the target population and active support from various actors and institutions involved. A public policy is an authoritative communication prescribing an unambiguous course of action for specified individuals or groups in certain situations. There must be an authority or leader charged with the implementation and monitoring of the policy with a sound social theory underlying the program and the target group. Evaluations can help estimate what effects will be produced by program objectives/alternatives.  However, [[Correlation does not imply causation|claims of causality]] can only be made with [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized control trials]] in which the policy change is applied to one group and not applied to a control group and individuals are randomly assigned to these groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Social and Behavioral Sciences Team 2016 Annual Report|journal=Executive Office of the President National Science and Technology Council|date=2016|url=https://sbst.gov/download/2016%20SBST%20Annual%20Report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haynes|first1=Laura|title=Test, Learn, Adapt: Developing Public Policy with Randomized Controlled Trials|journal=United Kingdom Cabinet Office Behavioral Insights Team|date=2012|url=http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/201256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Randomized Control Trials to Evaluate Public Policy|url=https://innovation.govspace.gov.au/using-randomised-control-trials-evaluate-public-policy|publisher=Australian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To obtain compliance of the actors involved, the government can resort to positive sanctions, such as favorable publicity, price supports, tax credits, grants-in-aid, direct services or benefits; declarations; rewards; voluntary standards; mediation; education; demonstration programs; training, contracts; subsidies; loans; general expenditures; informal procedures, bargaining; franchises; sole-source provider awards...etc.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle A. Saint-Germain, California State University&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steps for conducting a policy evaluation===
Policy evaluation is used to examine content, implementation or impact of the policy, which helps to understand the merit, worth and the utility of the policy. Following are National Collaborating Centre for Healthy Public Policy's (NCCHPP) 10 steps:&lt;ref&gt;Morestin, F. and Castonguay, J. (2013).

; Planning:
* Clarify the policy
* Engage stakeholders
* Assess resources and evaluability
* Determine your evaluation questions
* Determine methods and procedures
* Develop evaluation plan

; Implementation:
* Collect data
* Process data and analyze results

; Utilization:
* Interpret and disseminate the results

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3388">A '''professional conference organiser''', '''professional congress organiser''' ('''PCO''') or '''conference company''' is a company which specialises in the organisation and management of congresses, conferences, seminars and similar events.

==Role==
PCOs can typically work as consultants for academic and professional associations. They usually provide full service management for conferences including conference design, [[abstract_management|abstract management software]], program development, registration, site and venue selection and booking, audiovisuals, IT support, logistics, leisure management, marketing, printing and web services, sourcing speakers, funding,  sponsorship and exhibitor sales, financial management and budget control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uKDnKFv3v0YC&amp;pg=PT322&amp;lpg=PT322&amp;dq=pco+conferences&amp;source=web&amp;ots=44eHJG8Ei5&amp;sig=ZQTKIwLhEwzOlMiEjG8Fx2b0y-4#PPT321,M1 Conferences and Conventions: A Global Industry By Tony Rogers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other companies offer related services including travel agents and public relations companies. They tend to focus on limited areas such as destination management.

==Size of market sector==
Recent surveys of UK conference venues have found that a third of conference bookings were made by PCOs or venue-finding agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/doc/Perceptions_of_south_and_west_London_business_toursim_30_Jan_2007_1207121.DOC Information drawn from the British Conference Venues Survey 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728100649/http://www.lda.gov.uk/upload/doc/Perceptions_of_south_and_west_London_business_toursim_30_Jan_2007_1207121.DOC |date=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitscotland.org/british_20_conference.pdf Survey of Conferences in Scotland in 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411070507/http://www.visitscotland.org/british_20_conference.pdf |date=April 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4999685/Service-quality-strengths-and-weaknesses.html Paid report in the Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management (first part free)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207013830/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4999685/Service-quality-strengths-and-weaknesses.html |date=December 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 UK-based conferences generated £7.6 billion in direct sales giving PCOs a central role in some £2.5 billion of revenue generation. The UK is ranked second behind the US for global market share of conferences. Thus, although there is no one source of global statistics for the conference market it appears that PCOs play a central role in several billion dollars' worth of revenue generation worldwide.

'''Roland "Roel" Pieper''' (born 1956) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] IT-[[entrepreneur]].

==Early life and education==
Pieper was born (April 13, 1956) in [[Vlaardingen]], son of an [[engineer]] at a car manufacturer. His father died when Pieper was 20, and on his 18th birthday he suffered a motoring accident which destroyed his sporting career as a player of the [[Juventus Schiedam]] [[basketball]] team. According to Pieper, both of these experiences instilled him with a certain toughness. Pieper obtained his [[MSc - Ir - degree]] from the [[Delft University of Technology]], 1980, in [[computer science]].

==Career in the United States==
After graduation, he worked for ten years for [[Software AG]] (both in [[Germany]] and in the [[United States]]), where he became Chief Technology Officer for the US branch. After leaving Software AG he was selected to be the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for [[Unix System Laboratories]] in the United States, a division of Bell Laboratories of  [[AT&amp;T]]. In 1993, after the resignation of co-founder [[Ralph Ungermann]], Roel became the president and CEO of [[Ungermann-Bass]].  Ungermann was tied to [[Tandem]] by an earlier [[White knight (business)|White Knight]] deal and Ungermann resigned after his required term. Roel renamed the company [[UB Networks]] while it was a subsidiary of [[Tandem Computers]]. Roel restructured [[UB Networks]] research investments into [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode|ATM]] technology, which was popular at the time, instead of continuing Ralph Ungermann's earlier successful investments and leadership in Ethernet technology.  Ungermann-Bass developed the first Virtual Network Architecture (VNA) in 1993. The ATM business was subsequently sold by Roel to Cisco. UB Networks itself was sold to Newbridge Networks successfully in 1996 after Pieper joined Tandem Computers as CEO. In 1996 Pieper became president and CEO of Tandem Computers where he was instrumental in repositioning the company. Under Pieper's leadership Tandem was sold to [[Compaq]] in 1997, and Pieper became a member of the executive board of Compaq. During his time in the US, Pieper gained a reputation as a successful restructurer. Under Pieper's leadership, USL, UB and Tandem Computer were successfully restructured and sold to strategic players in the industry.

==Career in the Netherlands==
Pieper returned to the Netherlands in 1998. For one year he was board member of the Dutch electronics giant [[Philips]] by invitation of [[Cor Boonstra]], then Philips' president. This involvement ended abruptly in May 1999 when Pieper got involved in the claimed coding technology of [[Jan Sloot]], a connection Pieper made on behalf of Philips. Philips officially decided not to use the technology. Pieper then decided to support the invention as a private investor and later also as board member, though Sloot's claimed huge compression is mathematically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ticc.uvt.nl/~pspronck/sloot.html |title=The Stick of Jan Sloot |publisher=Ticc.uvt.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inventor died of a heart attack shortly after he demonstrated his technology to a group of 20 investors and technology companies in the summer of 1999. After one year, Pieper ended his employment at Philips with a severance package of undisclosed value.

In 1998, together with ex-minister of economy [[Hans Wijers]], Pieper set up Twinning, an incubator for starting entrepreneurs, particularly in the IT and especially the Internet sector. The project received ninety Million [[Guilder]]s of government subsidy, and as the [[Dot-com bubble]] burst, the ministry decided to sell Twinning to a group of private investors. Of the fifty companies that Twinning started, more than 35 are still operating and some very successfully.

Pieper also independently took part in more than 30 IT businesses all as investor and or adviser. On 1 September 1999 Pieper was appointed as a professor of Electronic Commerce, a newly created chair at the faculty of informatics and technology management of the [[University of Twente]]. Pieper ended as a professor of business administration and corporate governance at the university of Twente in 2013.

At the end of 1999, Pieper founded [[Insight Capital Partners Europe]], a private investment fund for IT-businesses, later operating under the name of Favonius Ventures, particularly in the field of e-commerce. In November 2000 he became Chairman of the Board of [[Lernout &amp; Hauspie]], a Flemish company specializing in speech recognition technology. Pieper was instrumental in uncovering a financial scandal at this company, which took place in the period 1996-1999, before he joined the company. In cooperation with the Belgian authorities, Pieper helped to secure information that ultimately led to the formal charging of the founders Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie. Pieper left as Chairman of the board after the shareholders decided to appoint a new CEO and board.

In 2001, Pieper entered into the board of advisors of Nearshore IT services company, [[Levi9 Global Sourcing]] and conducted a study requested by minister [[Tineke Netelenbos]] for setting up a system for road pricing, called ''Mobimiles''.  Later that year he became president of [[Connekt]], an organisation for addressing road tolling issues in the Netherlands. He presided as Chairman for seven years.

==Eclipse Aviation==
In 2003, Pieper started a new venture involving Very Light Jets ([[VLJ]]), in cooperation with Albuquerque, New Mexico-based [[Eclipse Aviation Corporation]].

Pieper, together with a Russian businessman Daniel Bolotin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoominfo.com/Search/ReferencesView.aspx?PersonID=1179760532 ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; started the joint venture investment business creating a Netherlands-based company called European Technology and Investment Research Center, or ETIRC BV.

The main project of ETIRC was ETIRC Aviation, which sought to establish an [[Air Taxi]] network for Europe, Turkey and Russia and a second manufacturing location for the Eclipse 500 jet in Russia for the European market. In July 2008, the Luxembourg-based ETIRC Aviation, which by then had become Eclipse Aviation's largest shareholder, ousted Eclipse Aviation founder Vern Raburn from his position as CEO.  Pieper then took over the job of acting CEO for Eclipse Corporation at the request of the shareholders and bondholders.

In the autumn of 2008, after Pieper had decided to raise the price of the Eclipse 500 aircraft substantially, several Eclipse customers sued Eclipse for the return of their deposits, claiming they had waited years for the delivery of their Eclipse 500 jets. After the collapse of the financial markets in autumn of 2008, the company Eclipse needed to be restructured and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, with the stated plan that a new company, headed by Pieper, would buy the assets of Eclipse and continue manufacturing. Pieper attempted to secure the necessary funds for this acquisition, but was unsuccessful largely due to the economic downturn, which led to several potential investors bowing out at the last moment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Eclipse Aviation ran out of money in mid-February 2009, ceased operations, and laid off its remaining 850 employees. On February 25, a group of creditors petitioned the Delaware bankruptcy court to convert Eclipse's bankruptcy to Chapter 7 liquidation. Soon thereafter, the board of directors (including Pieper) acknowledged the company had no other options but to file for Chapter 7, effectively ending the company's 10-year run, during which it spent an estimated $2 billion in investments and loans. Various reports following the Chapter 7 filing of the company insinuated financial problems for Pieper including an email from Pieper himself &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprout.nl/74/6955/nieuws/roel-pieper-nadert-faillissement.html |title=Roel Pieper nadert faillissement - Nieuws - Sprout, Inspireert ondernemers |publisher=Sprout.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2009, following the Chapter 7 filing of Eclipse Aviation, ETIRC BV in the Netherlands also declared bankruptcy. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] newspaper ''[[de Volkskrant]]'' reported that Pieper had invested US$146 million in Eclipse through ETIRC.&lt;ref name="Marsh16Apr09"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.aopa.org/aircraft/articles/2009/090416etirc.html|title = Investor who tried to save Eclipse is bankrupt|accessdate = 2009-04-13|last = Marsh|first = Alton K.|authorlink = |date = April 2009|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090425134245/http://www.aopa.org/aircraft/articles/2009/090416etirc.html|archivedate = 2009-04-25|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roel Pieper has two lawsuits pending on the demise of ETIRC BV. The first case led by a group of consultants who claim to not have been paid for six months was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quotenet.nl/biz/roel-pieper-verliest-wederom-rechtszaak.php |title=Roel Pieper verliest nog een rechtszaak en moet consultants Etirc €430.000 betalen - Quotenet - de website van Quote |publisher=Quotenet.nl |date=2010-12-06 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archief.nrc.nl/index.php/2010/December/4/Economie/17/Pieper+verliest+rechtszaak/check=Y |title=Pieper verliest rechtszaak |publisher=Archief.nrc.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401215415/http://archief.nrc.nl/index.php/2010/December/4/Economie/17/Pieper+verliest+rechtszaak/check=Y |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including a delay and review of a case by a legal firm that specialises in take-overs and bankruptcy claims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.depers.nl/economie/466586/Iedereen-wil-geld-van-Pieper.html |title=Iedereen wil geld van Pieper |publisher=DePers.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216231359/http://www.depers.nl/economie/466586/Iedereen-wil-geld-van-Pieper.html |archivedate=2012-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Al Mann, who had Roel Pieper sign a 10 million collateral before he would invest 20 million in Eclipse. Al Mann and Roel Pieper have subsequently settled out of court &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=leagle.com |url=http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=In%20NYCO%2020101019285.xml&amp;docbase=CSLWAR3-2007-CURR |title=ALFRED E. MANN v. ETIRC - Decided October 19, 2010 |publisher=Leagle.com |date=2010-10-19 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in a court case of 2016 there were still outstanding issues with Mann &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.quotenet.nl/Nieuws/Wereldwijd-beslag-gelegd-op-bezit-zwangere!-Roel-Pieper-169731|title='Wereldwijd beslag gelegd op bezit (zwangere!) Roel Pieper'|work=Quote|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

This investment was done with non-collateral US$150 million credit of Russian "Sviaz-bank". The Russian newspaper ''[[Vedomosti]]'' reported that this credit became later an object of an investigation in Russia, of which Pieper was not a part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article/2010/07/08/239926 |title=ВЕДОМОСТИ - Крупным планом: Как раздать миллиард |publisher=Vedomosti.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time he was fighting to save Eclipse, Pieper was investing tens of millions of dollars in a Russian technology to extract diesel fuel from coal. The Coal to Liquid project is on hold and will restart when oil prices have reached prices again above 100 dollars per barrel.

==Failures and successes==
Any venture capital investor is expected to have some of its investments fail, and Pieper has been able to keep a good set of results between failures and successes. Various successful companies include Veritas Software, Netwise, Quokka Sports, Google, TiVo, Netscape, General Instrument, Lost Boys, and various others. Some failures include a magazine, ''Opinio'', much older projects such as a web site, Tradingcars.com, and the telecommunications company Stonehenge. Efforts to start MyGuide, a company specializing in GPS navigation units and meant to compete with TomTom, also failed. Roel Pieper has been held accountable by the receivership of MyGuide for the lack of an administration, a coherent strategy and inferior products. There is currently a claim of 2 million Euros pending, which Pieper claims to be erroneous. At the trial it was noted that he maintained bad bookkeeping but due to the nature of the laws was unable to be held personally accountable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quotenet.nl/Nieuws/Uitspraak-in-zaak-My-Guide-en-Roel-Pieper-zet-deur-open-voor-wanbeleid-en-fraude-103759&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, all cases around MyGuide have been closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quotenet.nl/biz/curator-roel-pieper-moet-2-miljoen-betalen.php |title=Curator MyGuide stelt Roel Pieper aansprakelijk voor ruim €2 miljoen - Quotenet - de website van Quote |publisher=Quotenet.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015 Roel Pieper had a court case pending regarding outstanding legal fees from Goodwin Procter &lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/24845365/__Familie_Pieper_voor_rechter__.html&lt;/ref&gt; which as of 2016 has been ruled in favour of goodwin procer. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.quotenet.nl/Nieuws/Roel-Pieper-verliest-weer-rechtszaak-en-moet-eindelijk-1-3-miljoen-neertellen-173595&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2016 the Goodwin Proctor lawsuit was settled out of court in a mutual agreement between all parties. 

==Pursuit Dynamics==
In 2009 Pieper was appointed CEO of UK-based production technology firm, Pursuit Dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=200909010700212682Y |title=FE Investegate &amp;#124;Pursuit Dynamics PLC Announcements &amp;#124; Pursuit Dynamics PLC: Appointment of new CEO |publisher=Investegate.co.uk |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently left the firm on 15 December 2011 as a result of a conflict with some shareholders who forced a rights issue which was announced after the company failed to meet revenue targets. Pieper resigned after the board of directors decided to support the rights issue strategy demanded by one group of shareholders.  The company subsequently was unable to return to its full potential as the rights issue created a period of high volatility and uncertainty. The company in fact never survived that decision and was unable to attract any substantial new business. The company sold its assets and was effectively liquidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/tag/roel-pieper/ |title=FT Alphaville » Roel Pieper |publisher=Ftalphaville.ft.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdx.biz/company/company-regulatory-news/the-resignation-of-ceo-roel-pieper |title=The resignation of CEO Roel Pieper |publisher=Pdx.biz |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RiRo Ventures==
Since 2002 the Pieper family has invested in a number of high tech ventures. The investments are not limited to a geography or to a specific sector. In a number of these ventures the strategic direction of the investments becomes evident. New energy, engines, propulsion and a number of unique IT technologies such as the Antenna Company which was founded and funded together with Marcel Boekhoorn who is a long term business partner and friend of the family. Since the failure of Eclipse Aviation due to the financial crisis in 2009, most of Pieper's activities have been related to the RiRo Ventures main investments. A new website describing these activities has been created recently named after the successor company BJMD Ventures. Both RiRO Ventures and BJMD Ventures are part of a family fund structure created to support investments globally.

==Personal life==
In May 2003, Pieper was target of an attack by a confused deranged man who broke into his house in [[Aerdenhout]], and stabbed his wife who made a full recovery. Pieper publicly blamed the Dutch police as the attacker was caught trespassing on the property, including with video proof, on previous occasions. The Dutch police refused to act until the attack almost killed Pieper's wife. The man who stabbed Pieper's wife was convicted and sentenced to [[compulsory psychiatric treatment]] in a closed judicial institute ([[Terbeschikkingstelling]] in the Dutch language). He then was granted a temporary leave in 2007. The man has since been reinstated into supervised custody.
Pieper emigrated to Monaco in March 2008. The stated reason being that he was not informed, or was informed far too late, by the police or [[Ministry of Justice (Netherlands)|Ministry of Justice]] of this temporary leave of the attacker, although the government officials had promised to do so in writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtl.nl/(/actueel/rtlnieuws/binnenland/articleview/)/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/2008/04_april/02/binnenland/0402_0715_Piper_uit_Nederland_om_tbs-er.xml |title=Tbs'er jaagt Pieper naar Frankrijk |language=nl |publisher=Rtl.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fd.nl/csFdArtikelen/WEB-HFD/y2008/m04/d02/roelpieper?t=Roel_Pieper_verlaat_Nederland_ Roel Pieper verlaat Nederland - Het Financieele Dagblad] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404060251/http://www.fd.nl/csFdArtikelen/WEB-HFD/y2008/m04/d02/roelpieper?t=Roel_Pieper_verlaat_Nederland_ |date=April 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2007, Pieper became one of the major stakeholders of the [[Amsterdam]] Basketball Club and was also working with the city of Amsterdam on a new youth project for integration and education focuses on sports. After Pieper emigrated in March 2008, Pieper no longer was involved with Amsterdam Basketball which closed its doors in April 2011 after it was unable to attract new sponsors to remain in the first league of basketball in the Netherlands. The club BC Apollo has since been revived to become the largest basketball club in the Netherlands with plans to return to the first (ere-) division of basketball after winning the championship in the second division. In the years after, the BC Apollo has returned successfully to first premier league of basketball in the Netherlands.   

In the summer of 2008, Pieper was helmsman on the Favonius yacht (Swan 82) and he successfully claimed the Swan World Cup in Porto Cervo, Italy. Together with his longtime associate and navigator Roy Heiner, Pieper finally won this event after various attempts. The hobby of sailing and regattas were given to Pieper by his father who taught him sailing and racing at a very young age. Pieper's father bought a small yacht called Favonius in 1974 and as a remembrance Pieper always tried to use that name as part of his memories of his father. In 2013 Pieper has assisted in creating the K3 Foundation in Portland, Oregon, USA. The target of the foundation is to restore and maintain the globally well known sailing yacht Kialoa III. The yacht has successfully returned to the racing scene in 2015. 

In the years after 2014, Pieper has been active in Ukraine in a number of investment projects. One of the projects is related to establishing the bio ethanol market based on the huge supply of corn in the Ukraine. In addition, several high tech agricultural projects have been started to determine if a cooperation between the Netherlands and Ukraine could be established successfully. One of the projects Agri Cooperative Europe has been created in 2017.

Pieper had three sons in his first marriage, three sons in his second marriage and currently lives with his third family in Kiev, Ukraine. His 7th son Roland Pieper Jr, was born in August 2017, in Kiev.

'''Scott Picken''' is a [[South Africa]]n-born [[real estate]] investor and entrepreneur. He is the co-founder of [[Wealth Migrate]], a fintech company that offers  [[real estate]] investments on its online marketplace through [[crowdfunding]]. He began offering real estate investment solutions at the age of 26 when he founded International Property Solutions. ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' named [[Wealth Migrate]] as one of the top 60 real estate crowdfunding solutions in the [[United States]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-drake/advancing-forward-the-top_b_6373984.html|title=Advancing Forward: The Top 60 US Real Estate Crowdfunding Platforms|last=Journalist|first=David Drake|last2=Group|first2=The Soho Loft Media|date=2014-12-24|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picken is the author of ''Property Going Global''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/Money/Property/Buying-property-overseas-is-like-buying-a-boat-expert-20150518|title=Buying property overseas is like buying a boat - expert|access-date=2016-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Picken grew up in [[South Africa]], before he moved to [[London]] to study. In 1998, Picken wrote his dissertation on how he expected technology to change the way we invest in property. He moved to [[London]] to continue his education. Picken graduated in 2001 with a [[masters degree]], also studying the effect of technology on [[real estate]] investing.&lt;ref name=crowdfund&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alois|first1=JD|title=Global Real Estate Crowdfunding Site Wealth Migrate Looks to Asia for Rapid Expansion|url=http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2015/08/72221-global-real-estate-crowdfunding-site-wealth-migrate-looks-to-asia-for-rapid-expansion/|publisher=Crowdfund Insider|date=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After leaving [[University]], Picken setup International Property Solutions (IPS) at the age of 26. The company assisted people with overseas investments in his native [[South Africa]]. During the next few years, Picken helped thousands of people invest in property on four different continents.&lt;ref name=crowdfund /&gt;

During an interview, Picken recalled the opportunity to invest in property after the 2008 financial crisis hit. He stated that there were incredible buying opportunities in [[Wimbledon, London]] at the time. In order to capitalize on these opportunities, he required £10 million but didn't have the time to raise the funds. He decided that after missing the buying opportunity, he would be interested in creating a vehicle that allowed investors to have quick access to buying power.&lt;ref name=crowdfund /&gt;

Following the development of the idea, Picken co-founded [[Wealth Migrate]] with Hennie Bezuidenhoudt as his co-founder. The company was launched to assist people to invest in real estate assets, through various partnerships.&lt;ref name=fin24&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Glenda|title=Driving access to the global property market|url=http://www.fin24.com/Finweek/Entrepreneurs/Driving-access-to-the-global-property-market-20151015|publisher=Fin24|date=October 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Picken took the step of using a number of existing partners to launch the [[crowdfunding]] platform. Picken was interviewed in the media on a regular basis following the launch of the innovative company. The platform allowed individuals to invest in property around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewberry|first1=Lisa|title=Real-estate crowdfunding is unchartered territory in SA|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/decor/property/2015/11/13/Real-estate-crowdfunding-is-unchartered-territory-in-SA|publisher=[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)]]|date=November 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was further developed by Picken after he studied the figures behind small investments made in real estate. Using equity companies as an example, they would often invest a small percentage of their funds into [[real estate]]. Serious investors would likely use a middleman for these transactions, which would dramatically affect the [[return on investment]]. [[Wealth Migrate]]'s margins were not only lower than traditional charges, but it also made larger projects more accessible to the common real estate investor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benjamin|first1=Jeff|title=Real estate crowdfunding trend presents new challenges, opportunities for financial advisers|url=http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20150713/FREE/150719980/real-estate-crowdfunding-trend-presents-new-challenges-opportunities|publisher=InvestmentNews|date=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picken stated in an interview with [[CNBC]] that investors could make both residential and commercial [[investments]]. Individual investors would normally struggle to invest in larger projects, as they would have to either find the partners themselves or find other ways to raise the full capital amount.&lt;ref name=cnbcafrica&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wealth Within the Property Sector|url=http://www.cnbcafrica.com/video/?bctid=4277034994001|publisher=[[CNBC Africa]]|date=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wealth Migrate would allow capital investments as low as $10,000 for investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Few Minutes With … Scott Picken of Wealth Migrate|url=https://www.financialpoise.com/accreditedinvestormarkets/a-few-minutes-with-scott-picken/|publisher=Financial Poise|date=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was launched in [[South Africa]], before expanding abroad.&lt;ref name=fin24 /&gt;

After five years in operation, [[Wealth Migrate]] was selected by [[The Huffington Post]] as one of the top United States Real Estate Crowdfunding Platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drake|first1=David|title=Advancing Forward: The Top 60 US Real Estate Crowdfunding Platforms|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-drake/advancing-forward-the-top_b_6373984.html|publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=December 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The selection likely came off the back of the growth of the real estate crowdfunding market, which grew to $2.5 billion in transactions in a single year in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowenstein|first1=Andie|title=A Secret Behind the Booming Real Estate Industry|url=https://www.multihousingnews.com/post/a-secret-behind-the-booming-real-estate-industry/|publisher=MultiHousing News|date=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picken featured in the news during 2015, discussing how he felt [[crowdfunding]] would radically change the way [[real estate]] transactions take place globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEO’s 2015 Prediction on Real Estate Crowdfunding|url=http://crowdfundbeat.com/2014/12/21/ceos-2015-prediction-on-real-estate-crowdfunding/|publisher=CrowdfundBeat}}&lt;/ref&gt; He raised $4 million in capital for [[Wealth Migrate]] for further expansion in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wealth Migrate Raises Nearly $4 Million to Expand Global Real Estate Investment Platform|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/wealth-migrate-raises-nearly-4-million-expand-global-real-estate-investment-platform-2055437.htm|publisher=MarketWired|date=September 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wealth Migrate brand expanded its operations to Asia in 2015, under the leadership of Picken.&lt;ref name=crowdfund /&gt;

==Investments==
During an interview with [[CNBC]], Picken discussed his investment strategy for [[Wealth Migrate]] in the [[London]]-area. The commercial [[real estate]] opportunity was based on converting abandoned pubs in the [[United Kingdom]] into convenience stores. The moves received coverage in the British media, as many [[supermarket]] chains used this as a method to open convenience stores in the country in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smithers|first1=Rebecca|title=Supermarkets targeting pubs to exploit legal loophole, says Camra|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/19/supermarkets-target-pubs-loophole-camra|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picken suggested in an interview with [[GQ magazine|GQ (magazine)]] that investments made by his firm are 70% commercial and 30% residential. The platform was developed to give serious investors the opportunity to make alternative commercial investments when compared to more traditional routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sephton|first1=Paul|title=World of Potential|publisher=[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major examples that were quoted on [[CNBC Africa]], was the investment made in the medical market. Picken stated that [[Wealth Migrate]] invested close to hospitals geographically, which allowed a steady return on the investment.&lt;ref name=cnbcafrica /&gt; Another example given was the investment and purchasing of [[commercial property]] around [[London]], where they would then rent the property to a convenience store company once it had been purchased.&lt;ref name=cnbcafrica /&gt;

Picken is the author of the book, Property Going Global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official website|url=http://propertygoingglobal.com|publisher=Property Going Global}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shakir Khan Durrani''' (also known as "Shakir K. Durrani.", and also transliterated as "Shakir'ullah") ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|شاکر اللہ درانی}}}})
(3 March 1928 – 20 November 2009) was a Pakistani banker and entrepreneur of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] origin whose most notable positions were that of managing director of [[Pakistan International Airlines]] and [[Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan|Governor]] of the [[State Bank of Pakistan]].

==Background==
Durrani served for three years as an officer in the Pakistani Army.&lt;ref name=FlightIntl1969&gt;{{cite news |last=Fricker |first=John |date=May 29, 1969 |title=PIA Looks Ahead |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200960.html |newspaper=[[Flight International]] |page=866 |location= |access-date=2015-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
After leaving military service Durrani started on a banking career.&lt;ref name=FlightIntl1969 /&gt; After some years in England, Durrani returned home to be appointed Deputy Managing Director of [[Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation]] (PICIC) in 1962.&lt;ref name=Dawn2009&gt;{{cite news |last=Idris |first=Kunwar |date=November 21, 2009 |title=From Subaltern to SBP Governor: Durrani |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/876265/from-subaltern-to-sbp-governor-durrani |newspaper=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |location=[[Karachi]] |access-date=2015-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/02/21/000178830_98101901580358/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt  |title=APPRAISAL OF PAKISTAN INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTMENT CORPORATION, LIMITED |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=February 5, 1963 |publisher=[[World Bank]] |access-date=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1966 the Pakistani government established the [[Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan|Investment Corporation of Pakistan]] (ICP), a government-owned [[mutual fund]] with the objective of enlarging the investor base and developing the capital markets in Pakistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://commerceplus.blogspot.com/2010/07/project-report-on-investment.html  |title=Investment Corporation of Pakistan |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Durrani was appointed its first managing director.&lt;ref name=FlightIntl1969 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawn2009 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sechistorical.org/museum/galleries/imp/imp05b.php  |title=The Imperial SEC? – Foreign Policy and the Internationalization of the Securities Markets, 1934–1990 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |quote=In 1966, USAID introduced the SEC to a Pakistani who was the managing director of the Investment Corporation of Pakistan and close to the president of Pakistan |website= |publisher= |access-date=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1969 the Pakistani government nationalized [[Pakistan International Airlines]] and appointed Durrani&lt;ref name=FlightIntl1969 /&gt; as its new managing director.&lt;ref name=Dawn2009 /&gt;

In July 1971 he was appointed [[Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan]]&lt;ref name=TheNewsIntl&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=SU Durrani passes away |url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=209702&amp;Cat=7&amp;dt=11/26/2009 |newspaper=[[The News International]] |location=[[Karachi]] |date=November 26, 2009 |access-date=2015-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but when the Pakistani military government lost [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|a disastrous war against India]] in December, SU Durrani's meteoric rise was over.  When [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] became President and Chief Martial Law Administrator of Pakistan in December 1971, Durrani was put under house arrest and later sent to prison. No charges were brought against Durrani.&lt;ref name=Dawn2009 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1973ISLAMA07854_b.html |title=BHUTTO VISIT – PRIVATE VISIT OF S.U.

After his release from prison, Durrani resumed his banking career. In the 1970s [[Bankers Equity Limited]] (BEL) arranged a joint venture between him and a large Japanese leasing company --- Orient Leasing (later [[ORIX]]),&lt;ref name=Dawn2009 /&gt; one of largest commercial aircraft lessors.  BEL took 25% of the equity; the Japanese took 40%; Durrani's business partner took 4% with Durrani taking the rest (31%). SU Durrani was appointed Chairman of the Orient Leasing Pakistan Limited (OLP) with [[Humayun Murad]] as General Manager and his nominee. The Japanese managed the company till 1990, when the company went public. The Japanese directors took up assignments in Europe with the 43-year-old Humayun Murad appointed as Managing Director and Durrani remained as Vice Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=DUBAI MAJID AL FUTTAIM, JAPAN ORIX IN LEASING JV |url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/fr/547602/replies?c=22 |newspaper=[[Khaleej Times]] |location=[[Dubai]] |date=June 12, 2001 |access-date=2015-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durrani later took on a number of projects in his home district, Charsadda, aimed at helping Pashtuns and Pakistanis, including job creation and funding humanitarian projects, development and charities.  These projects included a fructose factory and [[Frontier Ceramics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://121.52.153.178:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/8830/Annual%20Report%202000.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y  |title=Annual Report 2000 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Frontier Ceramics |access-date=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the largest in output of Italian style tiles and functional ceramics in Asia (at the time).

[[International finance|International financial transactions]] are based on several [[financing]] philosophies, whose application is affected by the course of [[economic growth]] and [[Economic development|development]] within an individual [[national economy]]. This is demonstrated  by the evolution of the financing technique known as International '''structured trade &amp; commodity finance''' ('''STCF''').&lt;ref&gt;Dr Kirchmayr Rudolf, "International Structured Trade &amp; Commodity Finance. The Circle of Opportunity", 2007, Linz: Freya Verlag KG, {{ISBN|978-3-902540-39-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

STCF is "[[cross-border trade]] finance in [[emerging markets]] where the intention is to get repaid by the [[liquidation]] of a flow of commodities."&lt;ref&gt;MacNamara John, "Structured Trade and Commodity Finance in Emerging Markets: What Can Go Wrong and How to Avoid It", 2001, Cambridge: Woodhead Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-85573-544-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modular system==

To better understand the various STCF financing constructions and techniques, which are to be found with greater frequency in actual financing situations, a STCF modular system can be used. The STCF modular system consists in several levels, which identify the typical stages of each STCF transaction:  a pre-export financing, a [[warehouse]] and [[transport]] financing, a tolling financing and an accounts receivables financing.

When considering a STCF financing technique, in addition to defining and categorizing the [[commodity]] type and its trading practices, a detailed analysis of the specific risks involved, including the allocation of risk and the mitigation and avoidance of such risk, as these risks might be specifically applicable and appropriate to STCF financing techniques and [[Financial transaction|transactions]], shall be considered.

==Aspects of risk==

The concentration on all aspects of risk leads to the specific STCF relevant risk themes, such as performance risk analysis, commodity hedging as well as collateral evaluation, assessment and development of an appropriate risk [[early warning system]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Kirchmayr Rudolf, "International Structured Trade &amp; Commodity Finance. The Circle of Opportunity", 2007, Linz: Freya Verlag KG, {{ISBN|978-3-902540-39-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sulaiman Saleh Olayan'''  ({{lang-ar|سليمان العليان}}) (November 5, 1918–July 4, 2002) was among [[Saudi Arabia]]'s wealthiest businessmen.

==Life and Achievements==
Orphaned at the age of six, Olayan had more humble beginnings than most of his business counterparts from the Kingdom. Olayan's rise to great wealth reflected his acumen, an ability to cross cultural barriers, as well as extraordinary timing.

Initially working for [[ARAMCO]] from 1937 to 1947, he left to start his own trucking company, the first of over 50 companies he would create or own.  Over a 55-year career as an independent businessman, he served as entrepreneur, investor and philanthropist. Under his guidance and leadership, the [[Olayan Group]] became both a leading diversified enterprise in [[Saudi Arabia]] and a major participant in global investing.&lt;ref name="Ali"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Al-Naimi |first1=Ali |title=Out of the Desert |date=2016 |publisher=Portfolio Penguin |location=Great Britain |isbn=9780241279250 |pages=96-97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of his entrepreneurial journey begins in the town of Unayzah in north central Saudi Arabia. For centuries, the town had been a haven for caravans venturing across the Najd, Saudi Arabia's heartland. The merchant families of Unayzah had developed important trading links with the world outside central Arabia - the cities on the Red Sea and [[Persian Gulf]] coast, which had ties to Africa and Asia.

In 1918, Suliman Olayan was born into one of these merchant families. His father, Saleh, had recently returned from Medina, where he had been a spice trader. Suliman spent the first years of his life in his family's ancestral hometown.

Suliman's mother died just a few months after he was born, and his father died when he was still a child. When he was about 10 years old, Suliman traveled with his older brother by camel to the Persian Gulf coast and then by boat to Bahrain. In Bahrain, at the dawn of the age of oil in that part of the Persian Gulf, Suliman attended the American school, where he learned English, and then the Al-Khalifa and Al-Jafariya schools. He proved to be an exceptional student with a prodigious memory and an uncanny ability to see things not just as they were but as they could be.
After leaving school in 1936, he went to work for The Bahrain Petroleum Company. A year later, he returned to Saudi Arabia to take a job with the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, the forerunner of the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco). By 1947, Suliman had risen from transportation dispatcher to storehouse supervisor to a position in Government Relations. During King Abdul Aziz Al Saud's historic visit to Dhahran in April of that year, Suliman served as a company translator.

In the wake of World War II, the oil industry was expanding rapidly. Sensing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Suliman set out on his own in the summer of 1947. With a personal loan secured on his home, he established General Contracting Company (GCC).

GCC's first customer was Bechtel, which was under contract to Aramco to manage the construction of the Trans-Arabian Pipe Line (Tapline), a mammoth project designed to link the oil wells in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province to a terminal in Lebanon on the Mediterranean Sea. GCC handled transportation and related services for the historic project.

Buoyed by GCC's success and with his entrepreneurial instincts and drive now in high gear, Suliman undertook a series of trailblazing projects in the 1950s. He played a key role in developing Saudi Arabia's earliest electrical power companies, founding the country's first public utility, the National Gas Company.

In 1954, he launched General Trading Company (GTC), the Group's food and consumer products distribution business. Also in 1954, Suliman was instrumental in introducing commercial insurance to Saudi Arabia, founding Arab Commercial Enterprises (ACE), which went on to become the largest insurance and reinsurance broker in the Middle East.

In the 1960s, Suliman turned to international equity investing, an activity which would eventually establish the Group as an influential participant in global capital markets.

Meanwhile, Suliman was also developing business alliances, pioneering in Saudi Arabia the concept of strategic partnerships and strengthening his relationship to Bechtel. Moreover, through GTC and GCC he acquired exclusive distributorships for Kimberly-Clark, General Foods, Pillsbury, Hunt Wesson, Cummins Engine, Kenworth and Atlas Copco. In 1969, the Group obtained a license from Kimberly-Clark to construct the first paper tissue converting plant in Saudi Arabia. The same year, GTC established one of the first cold storage and meat processing plants in the Kingdom, and the Group played a leading role with other Saudi and foreign investors to establish a large factory for manufacturing plastic pipe and fittings. Other joint manufacturing ventures with major multinationals followed.

Beginning in the late 1980s, the Group embarked on a series of new activities in Saudi Arabia, focusing on light manufacturing and franchising, reaching beyond the Kingdom to other Persian Gulf countries and the [[greater Middle East]]. At the same time, it consolidated and strengthened existing operations, a process that continues to this day.

He is survived by his son Khaled Olayan, his three daughters, Hayat Olayan, Hutham Olayan, [[Lubna Olayan]], and his wife Mary.

'''The Outies,''' formally known as the "Out &amp; Equal Workplace Awards", is an annual awards gala hosted by [[Out &amp; Equal]] Workplace Advocates. The Outies honor individuals and organizations that are leaders in advancing [[Egalitarianism|equality]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Raeburn|first=Nicole Christine|title=Changing corporate America from inside out: lesbian and gay workplace rights By |year=2004|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-3999-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2rdnDOqAagC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=outies+lgbt+award&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WdyGTLyyMYagsQPlqsiNCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 September 2010|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender ([[LGBT]]) employees in America’s workplaces. Through these awards, Out &amp; Equal provides the business and LGBT communities with examples of innovative approaches and proven successes to help create safe and equitable workplaces. The awards are presented annually at the [[Out &amp; Equal Workplace Summit]], a nationwide conference addressing LGBT issues in the workplace.

Outie Awards are given in five different categories, with two recognizing individuals and three recognizing organizations. To win an Outie, recipients must have taken significant action to create more equitable workplaces for members of the LGBT community.

==Award Categories==
The Workplace Excellence Award recognizes any employer that has an historic and ongoing commitment to pursuing and executing workplace equality for LGBT employees in their own workplace. This employer has a history of continually raising the bar of workplace equality for others to follow.&lt;ref name="outandequal.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outandequal.org/outie-awards |title=Overview &amp;#124; Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates |publisher=Outandequal.org |date=2012-11-01 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trailblazer Award recognizes an LGBT person who has made a significant contribution to advancing workplace equality. This individual’s activities will have made a marked improvement in their own workplace and/or have contributed to equality nationally.

The Champion Award recognizes any LGBTQ person or ally who has made a significant contribution to advancing workplace equality. The Champion Award winner will have shown a unique commitment to LGBTQ workplace rights and will have used their talents to further that cause, even if at some risk..

The LGBT ERG of the Year Award recognizes a particular employee resource group (ERG), sometimes referred to as a business group or network, that has a proven track record of success in advocating for LGBT equal rights in its own workplace.

The Regional Affiliate of the Year Award recognizes an Out &amp; Equal regional affiliate that has demonstrated commitment to the Out &amp; Equal mission through exceptional programming and sound organizational practices.

The Significant Achievement Award recognizes any employer that has made significant strides in the past year in advancing a fair and equitable workplace for its LGBT employees, such as: announcing domestic partner health insurance, including gender identity diversity training, or initiating a unique general advertising campaign that includes LGBT people.

==Selection Process==
All Outie nominations are read by the Out &amp; Equal awards committee and judging panel, which is made up of a diverse cross-section of leaders in the movement for LGBT workplace equality. Awards Committee members and judges change each year and are expected to opt out of voting if their own affiliations may bias their votes.

Nominees are evaluated on originality, duplicability of initiatives, leadership, results, and other criteria. Organizations are evaluated based on the aforementioned criteria, plus the degree to which they have incorporated the 20 Steps to an Out &amp; Equal Workplace. The previous year’s awardees are not considered for the same award for the following two years. Additionally, companies or organizations may only submit one nomination in the organization award categories and one nomination in the individual award categories, for a maximum possible total of two nominations from any one company or organization.&lt;ref name="outandequal.org"/&gt;

==Outie Award Winners==

=== Workplace Excellence Award ===

'''Thomas Haffa''' (born 18 April 1952 in [[Kressbronn am Bodensee]]) is a [[Germany|German]] businessman who founded [[EM.TV]], a German Media Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2001/01/18/0118faces.html |title=Forbes Faces: Thomas Haffa |accessdate=2009-04-10 | date=2001-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haffa became known as [[CEO]] of EM.TV, one of the companies with a very spectacular rise and a very deep fall at the stock exchange segment [[Neuer Markt]]. In 2010 Haffa took the 229th place in the list of richest Germans with an estimated fortune of 200 to 300 million euros.&lt;ref name="SZ2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/unternehmergeist-haffa-macht-hobby-zum-geschaeft-1.823456 |title=Haffa macht Hobby zum Geschäft |publisher=Süddeutsche.de |date=2010-05-17 |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2003, he was fined 1.2 million [[euro]]s for misleading [[shareholder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manager-magazin.de/magazin/artikel/0,2828,292229,00.html |title=Was macht eigentlich Thomas Haffa? |accessdate=2009-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
After leaving school, Haffa, who grew up in [[Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm|Pfaffenhofen]], started his apprenticeship as a wholesaler and salesman with a [[BMW]] dealer, then worked as a sales assistant at [[IBM]] from 1973 onwards. At the beginning of the 1980s, Haffa started with the [[Kirch Group]] and started to build the video game [[Taurus Video]]. Over the next few years, he has worked as a director of merchandising and music publishing companies.

In 1989, Haffa became self-employed and, together with his brother Florian and TV mogul [[Haim Saban]], founded the ''EM-Entertainment Munich, Merchandising, Film und Fernseh GmbH'' ([[EM.TV]]). Marketing objects from this period are [[Tabaluga]], the [[Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles]] and the rights of the [[Expo 2000]].

With the stock exchanges on October 30, 1997, a spectacular rise from EM.TV began: the share price of 0.38 euros followed a record high after the other, also by the establishment of ''Junior TV'' at the end of 1998 together with the troubled [[Kirch Group]]. In the wake of the [[New Economy]], Haffa made another spectacular acquisition, such as a 50% share of the marketing rights of the [[Formula 1]] in 2000 (for about 3.3 billion euros) and the parent company of the [[Muppet Show]] EM.TV into a global media company. There were added the worldwide rights to well-known cartoon characters such as [[Maya the Honey Bee]], [[The Flintstones]] and [[Alfred J. Kwak]]. The shares of EM.TV recorded a record high of 110 Euros in March 2000.

In the autumn of 2000, Thomas Haffa and his brother Florian, who worked as a financial director at EM.TV, had to correct the company's winners' expectations several times downwards. The share price then broke down and fell below 20 euros.

The brothers Thomas and Florian Haffa had sold a large part of their EM.TV shares in good time before announcement of the negative news and the strong price decline. Thomas Haffa had even violated the holding period when he sold shares at the price level in February 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Volker H. Peemöller, Stefan Hofmann: ''Bilanzskandale: Delikte und Gegenmaßnahmen'', Erich Schmidt Verlag, Berlin 2005, {{ISBN|978-3-503-09031-0}}, S. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Haffa retired on 25 July 2001 as Chairman of the Board of EM.TV. He was sentenced to a fine of 1.2 million euros on 8 April 2003, his brother Florian to 240,000 euros because of misrepresentation of the company relations. The [[Federal Court of Justice]] confirmed this judgment at the end of 2004, the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] rejected a complaint from the Haffa brothers as "unfounded" in 2006. Thus, they were finally sentenced to criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/management/strategie/ex-em-tv-vorstaende-verfassungrichter-weisen-haffa-brueder-ab/2654456.html |title=Verfassungsrichter weisen Haffa-Brüder ab |publisher=Handelsblatt |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both brothers had to submit to hundreds of court cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/geld/die-haffas-gescheitert-am-neuen-markt-die-boersen-blender-1.21556|title=Die Börsen-Blender|publisher=Süddeutsche.de|date=2010-03-10 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a ruling by the Federal Court of Justice in favor of injured shareholders, many of EM.TV's shareholders were not successful in their claims for damages because the required evidence of a direct link between the erroneous company reports and the decision of purchasing shares was difficult to provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/management/strategie/olg-muenchen-em-tv-anleger-unterliegen-vor-gericht/2571812.html |title=EM.TV-Anleger unterliegen vor Gericht |publisher=Handelsblatt |date=2005-11-03|accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, an investor group within Thomas Haffa, transferred the operative business of the insolvent commercial vehicle company [[Kögel Trailer]] in [[Ulm]]. Kögel had to file for insolvency again in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manager-magazin.de/unternehmen/industrie/a-800331.html |title=Insolvenzverwalter Schneider gilt als "Erhalter" |publisher=manager-magazin.de |author=Cornelia Knust |date=2011-11-28 |accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Haffa is the managing director of Munich-based ''Air Independence''. In the spring of 2010, he acquired the majority of the teleshopping channel [[Channel 21 (Germany)|Channel 21]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/management/koepfe/thomas-haffa-der-zauberlehrling-bricht-seinen-schwur-seite-all/3449982-all.html |title=Der Zauberlehrling bricht seinen Schwur |publisher=Handelsblatt |author=Hans-Peter Siebenhaar |date=2010-06-01|accessdate=2013-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, he and his wife Gabriele bought the shipping company ''Dahm International'', which is one of the world's largest yacht dealers.&lt;ref name="SZ2010" /&gt;

''[[The Myanmar Times]]'' began publishing in 2000. Ross Dunkley had 49% of the company and Sonny Swe, an associate of General [[Khin Nyunt]] owned 40%.
General Khin Nyunt was arrested and Sonny Swe was also temporarily detained in November 2004.&lt;ref name=Phanida20110215/&gt;
Sonny Swe's stake in ''The Myanmar Times'' was transferred to his wife, Yamin Htin Aung, who continued to hold the local share with another investor, Pyone Maung Maung, for almost a year.&lt;ref name=ir&gt;[http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=4979 Uncertainty Surrounds Myanmar Times] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812080910/http://irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=4979 |date=2010-08-12 }} ''The Irrawaddy'', September 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, she was forced by the Ministry of Information to sell her stake to Dr Tin Tun Oo.&lt;ref name="ir"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mizzima&gt;[http://www.rebound88.net/05/sep/15.html Myanmar Times on the Rocks after Share-Holder Pullout] ''Mizzima'', September 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Tin Tun Oo was vice-chairman of the [[Myanmar Writers and Journalists Association]] (MWJA).
Under the MWJA constitution, as an independent association no members could belong to a political party.
In August 2010 Tin Tun Oo and other senior members of the executive resigned so that they could compete in the national elections.&lt;ref name=Htun20100912&gt;{{cite web

'''Trade barriers''' are government-induced restrictions on [[international trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/trade-barrier.html |title=What is trade barrier? definition and meaning |work=BusinessDictionary.com  |accessdate=May 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Most trade barriers work on the same principle: the imposition of some sort of cost (money, time, bureaucracy, quota) on trade that raises the price or availability of the traded [[product (business)|products]]. If two or more nations repeatedly use trade barriers against each other, then a [[trade war]] results.

Economists generally agree that trade barriers are detrimental and decrease overall [[efficiency (economics)|economic efficiency]]; this can be explained by the [[comparative advantage|theory of comparative advantage]]. In theory, [[free trade]] involves the removal of all such barriers, except perhaps those considered necessary for health or national security. In practice, however, even those countries promoting free trade heavily subsidize certain industries, such as [[agriculture]] and [[steel]].

==Overview==
High income countries tend to have less trade barriers than middle income countries which, in turn, tend to have less trade barriers than low income countries.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214312216300151|title=Handbook of Commercial Policy|last=Bown|first=C.

According to Chad Bown and Meredith Crowley, world trade is "probably" vastly more liberal in current times than was the case historically.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Ronald Findlay and Kevin H. O’Rourke, "for the nineteenth and twentieth centuries trade barriers and transport costs were the most important barriers to trade".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c9585.pdf|title=Commodity Market Integration, 1500–2000|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also write, "during the mercantilist era price gaps were as likely to be due to trade monopolies, pirates, and wars as to transport costs and tariffs, which are more easily quantifiable."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Georgetown University]] Professor Marc L. Busch and [[McGill University]] Professor Krzysztof J. Pelc note that modern trade deals are long and complex because they often tackle [[non-tariff barriers to trade]], such as different standards and regulations, in addition to [[tariff]]s. Due to steadily decreasing tariff barriers since WWII, countries have become increasingly likely to enact trade barriers in the form of non-tariff barriers. National firms often lobby their own governments to enact regulations that are designed to keep out foreign firms, and modern trade deals are one way to do away with such regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/02/yes-the-tpp-agreement-is-over-5000-pages-long-heres-why-thats-a-good-thing/|title=Yes, the TPP agreement is over 5,000 pages long. Here’s why that’s a good thing|website=Washington Post|access-date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The barriers can take many forms, including the following:

* [[Tariff]]s
* [[Non-tariff barriers to trade]] include:
** [[Import license]]s
** Export licenses
** [[Import quota]]s
** [[Subsidies]]
** [[Voluntary Export Restraints]]
** Local content requirements
** [[Embargo]]
** [[Devaluation|Currency devaluation]]&lt;ref&gt;The Wall Street Journal of Europe, October. 11, 2011 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Trade restriction]]

==Impacts of trade barriers on business==

Trade barriers are often criticized for the effect they have on the developing world.  Because rich-country players call most of the shots and set trade policies, goods such as crops that developing countries are best at producing still face high barriers.  Trade barriers such as taxes on food imports or subsidies for farmers in developed economies lead to overproduction and dumping on world markets, thus lowering prices and hurting poor-country farmers.  Tariffs also tend to be anti-poor, with low rates for raw commodities and high rates for labor-intensive processed goods. The [[Commitment to Development Index]] measures the effect that rich country trade policies actually have on the developing world.

Trade barriers are mostly a combination of conformity and per-shipment requirements requested abroad, and weak inspection or certification procedures at home. The impact of trade barriers on companies and countries is highly uneven. One particular study showed that small firms are most affected (over 50%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Invisible Barriers to Traded|year=2015|publisher=International Trade Center|location=Geneva, Switzerland|url=http://www.intracen.org/publication/The-Invisible-Barriers-to-Trade---How-Businesses-Experience-Non-Tariff-Measures/|ref=MAR-15-326.E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another negative aspect of trade barriers is that they result in a limited choice of products and would therefore force customers to pay higher prices and accept inferior quality.&lt;ref&gt;Bleacher Hans; Lee Dahringer; Helmet Leis, ''International Marketing: A Global Perspective'', 1999: p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade barriers obstruct free trade. Before exporting or importing to other countries, firstly, they must be aware of restrictions that the government imposes on the trade. Subsequently, they need to make sure that they are not violating the restrictions by checking related regulations on tax or duty, and finally they probably need a license in order to ensure a smooth export or import business and reduce the risk of penalty or violation.  Sometimes the situation becomes even more complicated with the changing of policy and restrictions of a country.

==Examples of free trade areas==
* [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA)
* [[South Asia Free Trade Agreement]] (SAFTA)
* [[European Free Trade Association]]
* [[Union of South American Nations]]
* [[New West Partnership]] (An internal free-trade zone in Canada between Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan)
* [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Cooperation Council common market]]

[[File:Original Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy.jpg|right|thumb|The original trophy, awarded from 1948 to 2009]]
The '''Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy''' was established by the [[National Aeronautic Association]] (NAA) in 1948 after a trust fund was created in 1936 by [[Godfrey Lowell Cabot]] of Boston, a former president of the NAA. It is awarded to a living American for "significant public service of enduring value to aviation in the United States."&lt;ref name=about/&gt; The presentation of the award is made annually at the Aero Club of Washington, as close as possible to December 17 each year,&lt;ref name=aero/&gt; the day on which, in 1903, the [[Wright brothers]] made the first flight in an airplane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/17_December | title = 17 December | publisher = [[European Space Agency]] | dead-url = no | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171211124506/http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/17_December | archive-date = December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural recipient of the trophy was [[William F.

'''Yehuda Talit''' ({{lang-he|יהודה טלית}}, born on 2 December 1944) is an [[Israel]]i [[businessman]], [[record producer]] and [[talent agent]].

==Biography==

===Childhood, teenage years and early career stages===

Talit was born in [[Tel Aviv]] where he studied at [[Gymnasia Balfour|Balfour]] Elementary School and later at the Agricultural High School at [[Mikve Israel]]. He first stepped into the business world with the production, promotion and selling of key chains with celebrity portraits imprinted on them, which were very popular during the 60’s.

===A producer and an agent===
In 1966 Talit met [[Haim Saban]] who was a member of “The Lions” band. Talit offered Saban to sell key chains with The Lions’ portraits, a move which was their first business partnership. The two of them went on and established a company that represented The Lions and other known Israeli performers of that time like Arik Einstein and The Churchills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=יאיר מנדלסון |url=http://www.themarker.com/advertising/1.278862 |title=מהפחון בבת ים לווילה בהוליווד TheMarker |publisher=Themarker.com |date=2011-06-23 |accessdate=2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 Talit founded “Talit Productions”. During the 1980s the company produced large concerts and brought international artists to Israel such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Dire Straits]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Boy George]], [[Bryan Adams]], [[Joe Cocker]], [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Duran Duran]], [[David Bowie]], [[The Eurythmics]] and many others. The company also initiated a line of Opera productions, Musicals, theater shows and sport events. The most prominent of them were The Bolshoy Theater, [[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]], [[Walt Disney]]’s [[World on Ice]] and the [[Harlem Globetrotters]].

Among other things Talit was also responsible for the Night of Love performance which was held in Tzemach, on the banks of the Sea of Galilee, The Magician, a musical based on The [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]], which ran since 1994 and had more than 600 shows. During the past few years, Talit has been responsible in a joint production with the Beit Lesin Theater in Israel, for the hit one man show starring [[Avi Kushnir]], Returning the Cave Man.

At the same time, the company has represented many artists and Israeli performers from Kaveret and Shalom Hanoch to Avi Kushnir and Danny Sanderson. Some of them still represented by the agency until this day.

===The TV business===
In 1997 Talit expanded his company when he got into the television business and founded “Talit Communications”, which later became “Talit Productions” founder. At the same time, he joined a business partnership with Ron Isaac and founded "Iguana Productions". In 1998, a year later, Talit added the broadcast rights for FTV. In 1999, together with Tamira Yardeni and Haim Slotzki, he founded “Synergy Communications”, which went on to win the rights to operate the Israeli Satellite Channel of [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]]. Talit also started a co partnership with EM.TV, the German content giant, which brought to the Israeli television children’s classics like Maya the Bee, The Muppet Show, Marco, Pinocchio, Niles Holgerson and Pippee Long stocking.

Although Talit sold half of the Talit group to the same German Company a few years later he bought back all of it from EM. TV.

In 2000 Talit created yet another partnership with Jim Hanson’s production company and reserved the Israeli rights for The Muppet Show. A year later, Talit went into sports with his Group Channel that broadcast the games of [[Maccabi Haifa]] and [[Manchester United]].

In 2003 Talit got the rights of representation for the French channel, TV5, and established the baby channel, [[Baby TV]]. In 2007 [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] purchased 50% of the ownership of the baby channel from the European firm holding the rights to the channel. Two years later Talit received the broadcast rights for the National Geographic Channel in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://b.walla.co.il/?w=/3050/1624735 |title=ערוצי נשיונל ג'אוגרפיק ייוצגו בישראל ע"י טלית תקשורת |publisher=B.walla.co.il |date= |accessdate=2011-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today “Talit Communications” owns and represents 20 channels broadcast in Israel.
