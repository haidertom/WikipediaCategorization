      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3788">'''Active ageing''' ('''active aging''' in the [[United States of America|US]]) is a concept recently deployed by the [[European Commission]], the [[World Health Organization]], and used also in [[Human Resource Management]]. This concept evokes the idea of longer activity, with a higher retirement age and working practices adapted to the age of the employee. It also extends to the social engagement of the elderly in the collectivity.
[[File:Egypte louvre 105.jpg|thumbnail|Two men practicing [[Tahtib]], one of them lost his hair, indicating advanced age, on an [[ostraca]] from [[ancient Egypt]], [[Louvre]]]]

== Demographic changes ==
Europeans demography shifts towards an elder population with lower [[birth rates]]. This will have repercussions on the European economy as less and less active people will support the social costs of health-care and pension of those who stopped working.
The EU-Commission has fixed 2 targets for 2010:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euractiv.com/fr/europe-sociale/vieillissement-actif-travailleurs-emettent-reserves/article-164437{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Euractiv.com&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Stockholm targets of 2001, which intend to reach 50% higher employment of elder people between 55 and 64.
# The Barcelona targets of 2002, which intend to progressively augment of 5 years the age of retirement in order to prolong the professional life of elder people.

== Theoretical background ==
The concept of active ageing was originally inspired by the work of Robert Havighurst on [[activity theory]], according to which elders' well-being relies on them staying active in later life; from this point of view, staying active is key to successfully ageing.&lt;ref&gt;Silke van Dyk, Stephan Lessenich, Tina Denninger et Anna Richter (2014). The Many Meanings of “Active Ageing”. Confronting Public Discourse with Older People’s Stories, Recherches sociologiques et anthropologiques 44(1): 97-115&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current understandings ==
At the end of the 20th century organizations such as the OECD and the International Labour Organization used the concept to address the challenges faced by the labour market: lengthening of retirement, maintaining the elderly in employment, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Thibauld Moulaert, Sylvie Carbonnelle et Laurent Nisen (2014). Le vieillissement actif dans tous ses éclats, Presses Universitaires de Louvain.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the World Health Organization (WHO) gave a new twist to the concept by emphasising the prevention of health problems.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2002). Active Ageing: A policy framework, http://www.who.int/ageing/publications/active_ageing/en/&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] platforms are in the process of being developed. &lt;ref&gt;Sammon, David, et al. "Special issue on IS/IT Applications for the Support of Older People." International journal of medical informatics 82.11 (2013): 1035-1036.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was then extended to elders being engaged in their communities (e.g. through volunteering) and their family. From this point of view an elder should optimize his or her health in order to benefit his or her own life as much as enrich the collectivity. Critics condemn the normativity of this model as [[Successful ageing|"successfully" ageing]] in which elders have to stay active and be involved in activities recognized as beneficial without taking into account their heterogeneous life courses.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Katz (2013). Active and Successful Aging. Lifestyle as a Gerontological Idea, Recherches sociologiques et anthropologiques 44(1): 33-49&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposes the "never-ending process, devouring millions of dollars and years of time on costly, redundant studies, conflicting requirements and wasteful litigation."  As of March 8, 2006, it was asking members to write a letter with these talking points:

*NEPA does not impose deadlines for evaluating [[Environmental Impact]] Studies, causing "[[paralysis by analysis]]."
*The mining industry relies heavily on federal land to produce  minerals and meet market demands. "Since 1980, the number of plans for new mining projects filed with the [[U.S. Bureau of Land Management]] has fallen steeply" and the industry is "throttled when projects never materialize and jobs are sent offshore."
*Congress must "gain a better understanding of the [[economic impact]]s of NEPA on the mining industry and American economy."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitolconnect.com/nma/letter.aspx?AlertID=116 {{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Amicus acquired competitor Callidus Biopharma for its enzyme replacement therapy treatment for [[Pompe disease]].&lt;ref name="10K2014" /&gt;{{rp|3,12}}

In September 2015, the company acquired [[Scioderm]] for $229 million in cash and stock, with potentially $618 million more in [[biodollar]]s. Scioderm had a drug in Phase III trials for [[epidermolysis bullosa]]; additionally, if the drug was approved the FDA would give its owner a [[priority review voucher]], which itself can be sold to another company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fidler|first1=Ben|title=Xconomy: With $229M Deal, Amicus Gets a New Drug And Perhaps a Voucher|url=https://www.xconomy.com/new-york/2015/08/31/with-229m-deal-amicus-gets-a-new-drug-and-maybe-a-voucher/?single_page=true|work=Xconomy|date=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That drug failed its Phase III trial in 2017 and Amicus abandoned it.

In 2016 Amicus acquired MiaMed which was working on drugs to treat [[CDKL5]] deficiency; Amicus paid $1.8M in cash and around $4.7M in stock, with $83M in biodollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Ben|title=Amicus spends $90M on MiaMed; gains rare disease preclinical program|url=https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/amicus-spends-90m-miamed-gains-rare-disease-preclinical-program|work=FierceBiotech|date=July 7, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Scott Gottlieb]] became FDA commissioner in 2017, the CEO of Amicus began lobbying him directly for the FDA to accept the NDA and in February 2018 the FDA accepted it and promised a response by August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carroll|first1=John|title=Once rejected, FDA now rolls out a short red carpet for Amicus’ migalastat|url=https://endpts.com/once-rejected-fda-now-rolls-out-a-short-red-carpet-for-amicus-migalastat/|work=Endpoints|date=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antonio Cando Halili''' (February 8, 1946 – July 2, 2018) was a [[Philippines|Filipino]] politician who served as the [[Mayor]] of [[Tanauan, Batangas]] from 2013 until his death in 2018. His term as Mayor was controversial due to his methods of dealing with crime and illegal drugs in his city. On July 2, 2018, he was killed during a ceremony after being shot through the chest by an unknown gunman.&lt;ref name="aljazeera.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/philippine-mayor-antonio-halili-assassinated-ceremony-180702054409964.html|title=Philippine Mayor Antonio Halili assassinated during ceremony|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/philippines-mayor-antonio-halili-tanauan-shot-sniper-drug-suspects-walks-shame/|title=Mayor known for humiliating drug suspects killed by sniper|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Prior to pursuing a political career, Antonio Halili was a businessman. He established ANC Halili Group of Companies (ANC HGC), a fully Filipino-owned [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] with subsidiaries participating involved in the real Estate, information technology, and private emission &amp; drug industries. ANC HGC runs 60 emission testing centers in Luzon alone.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Political career==
===Mayor of Tanauan===
Halili became mayor of [[Tanauan, Batangas|Tanauan]], a city in the province of [[Batangas]] in the [[Philippines]], in 2013. During his term as Mayor, he gained notoriety for his treatment of suspected criminals, namely those involved in drug-related crimes. In 2016, Halili became the center of newfound attention after he ordered drug suspects to be paraded around the city, in a campaign that was dubbed the ‘walk of shame’. Suspected criminals were forced to wear cardboard signs that read, “I'm a pusher, don't emulate me”. His campaign was criticized by human rights groups and other politicians. Later on in his term, Halili himself would be accused of having drug related ties, an accusation he denied. In October 2017, he had his supervisory powers over the local police stripped from him.&lt;ref name="aljazeera.com"/&gt;

==Assassination==
{{main|Assassination of Antonio Halili}}
On July 2, 2018, during a flag raising ceremony, Halili was shot by an unidentified sniper. The bullet hit a mobile phone in Halili’s pocket and pierced his chest. Halili’s bodyguards fired back towards a hill where the bullet appeared to have come from. The police searched the hill but failed to find anyone. Bystanders were shocked, and began panicking and taking cover. Halili was driven to the Reyes Memorial Hospital and was declared dead less than an hour after the bullet was fired. Philippine National Police Chief Director General [[Oscar Albayalde]] said that a regional special task group had been convened to investigate the killing, and was considering the suspect parades a motive. One day later, another Philippine Mayor, Ferdinand Bote of [[General Tinio, Nueva Ecija]], was also shot.&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aljazeera.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www-m.cnn.com/2018/07/01/asia/philippines-mayor-halili-tanuan-shot-intl/index.html?rm=1|title=Philippines mayor shot dead by sniper, police chief says|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/ferdinand-bote-killed-assassinated-philippines-mayor-nueva-ecija-antonio-halili-a8429121.html|title=Philippine mayor assassinated one day after another was shot dead|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Baxter International was founded in 1931 by Donald Baxter, a [[Los Angeles]]-based [[Physician|medical doctor]], as a manufacturer and distributor of [[intravenous therapy]] solutions.&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt; Seeing a need for products closer to the Midwest, the company opened a manufacturing plant in [[Glenview, Illinois]], in 1933.&lt;ref name = "history"/&gt; Baxter's interest was bought out in 1935 by Ralph Falk, who established a [[research and development]] function.  In 1939 the company developed a vacuum-type collection container, extending the [[shelf life]] of blood from hours to weeks.  In 1954, the company expanded operations outside of the United States by opening an office in [[Belgium]]. In 1956 Baxter International introduced the first functioning [[artificial kidney]], and in 1971 became a member of the [[Fortune 500]].

In 1971, Baxter built a major manufacturing plant in [[Ashdod, Israel]], and as a result, the company was placed on the [[Arab League boycott of Israel|Arab League boycott list]] in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=boycott&gt;{{cite book|last=Feiler|first=Gil|title=From Boycott to Economic Cooperation: The Political Economy of the Arab Boycott of Israel|publisher=Frank Cass Publishers|year=2005|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the company expanded to deliver a wider variety of products and services (including vaccines, a greater variety of blood products) through acquisitions of various companies.  Sales and production facilities also expanded throughout the world.&lt;ref name = history&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.baxter.com/about_baxter/company_profile/sub/history.html | title=History | publisher=Baxter International | access-date=July 8, 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602055413/http://www.baxter.com/about_baxter/company_profile/sub/history.html | archivedate=June 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Baxter acquired Medcom, Inc., a New York-based firm founded by [[Richard Fuisz]] and his brother, that had large markets in the United States and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name=tribune90&gt;{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Steven|title=Baxter Told To Pay Firm $15 Million|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=|date=March 17, 1990|url=

In 1991, Baxter's home infusion subsidiary, [[CVS Health|Caremark]], "was accused by the government of paying doctors to steer patients to its intravenous drug service"&lt;ref name="chicagotribune_1995"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-06-19/business/9506190063_1_baxter-international-million-settlement-bear-stearns | title=Caremark Wounds Not Deep Penalty Could Have Been More Damaging| publisher=Chicago Tribune | date=June 19, 1995 | access-date=October 17, 2015 | author=Yates, Ronald E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 Caremark spun off from Baxter International.&lt;ref name="chicagotribune_1995" /&gt; Caremark was fined $160 million for the "four-year-long federal mail-fraud and kickback" scheme in which the "home-infusion business unit made weekly payments to scores of doctors that averaged about $75 per patient for referring those patients to its services. Some doctors earned as much as $80,000 a year from the kickbacks, according to government documents."&lt;ref name="chicagotribune_1995" /&gt;

==Environmental activities==
In 1997, a report produced by the company indicated that changes made to reduce environmental impacts generated savings that exceeded their cost, producing a net profit.

===Corporate governance===
In 1953 William Graham became the company's [[Chief executive officer|CEO]].  Vernon Loucks became [[President#Non-governmental presidents|president]] and CEO in 1980.

{{quote|"In January, as Baxter International Inc.'s Vernon Loucks relinquished his CEO duties after 18 years, directors handed him a special stock-option grant of 950,000 shares "for the specific purposes of motivating" him "to implement a smooth transition of his responsibilities." If Mr. Loucks sells all the 400,000 shares he can exercise at year end and Baxter's stock price remains at its current level, he will make more than $4 million."|The Wall Street April 29, 1999}}

Loucks was succeeded by Harry Kraemer, who was succeeded by Robert Parkinson, who took the CEO position in 2004.&lt;ref name = history/&gt;

==H1N1 vaccine==
In June 2009, Baxter International announced it expected to have the first commercial [[vaccine]] for the [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1 ("swine flu") influenza]] as early as July of the same year. The company has been one of several working with the [[World Health Organization]] and United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] on the vaccine, and uses a [[cell (biology)|cell]]-based rather than [[egg (food)|egg]]-based technology that allows a shorter production time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2009/06/13/Baxter-to-release-flu-vaccine-in-July/UPI-41571244908860/ | title = Baxter to release flu vaccine in July | publisher=[[United Press International]] | date = June 13, 2009 | access-date = July 2, 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090616050354/http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2009/06/13/Baxter-to-release-flu-vaccine-in-July/UPI-41571244908860/| archivedate= June 16, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===1975 Hemofil hepatitis B outbreak===
In August 1975, Baxter / Travenol withdrew a clotting factor product Hemofil after the product was associated with an outbreak of hepatitis B.&lt;ref&gt;http://health.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Tribunal-of-Inquiry-into-the-Infection-with-HIV-and-Hep-C-of-persons-with-Haemophilia-and-Related-Matters.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===1983 prison plasma collection===
Baxter, unknown to the FDA, continued to use prison plasma in factor concentrate production until October 1983, despite having entered into an agreement with the FDA (11 months earlier) that they would no longer use US prison plasma, which posed a high risk of virus transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Class Action Complaint (2004) Case No. C032572 PJH. Page 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996 Japanese haemophiliac [[HIV]] lawsuit===
It was announced in quarter 1 of 1996 that Baxter had agreed to settle a lawsuit involving 200 Japanese haemophilia patients who had become infected with HIV as a result of using [[Contaminated haemophilia blood products|contaminated haemophilia products]] which were unheated. The Japanese courts ordered for each victim to receive $411,460 by March 29 that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Letter|first1=The Pharma|date=|title=Baxter Agrees To Settle Japan HIV Lawsuit|url=http://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/baxter-agrees-to-settle-japan-hiv-lawsuit|website=www.ThePharmaLetter.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2001 Althane disaster===
{{Main article|Baxter Althane disaster}}
The Baxter Althane disaster in autumn 2001 was a series of 56 sudden deaths of [[renal failure]] patients in Spain, Croatia, Italy, Germany, Taiwan, Colombia and the USA (mainly Nebraska and Texas). All had received hospital treatment with Althane [[hemodialysis]] equipment, a product range manufactured by Baxter International, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=|title=Baxter Dialyzer Recall|url=http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BI108/BI108_2007_Groups/group05/pages/baxter.html|work=Major Recalls of Organ Replacement Devices|access-date=October 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012151427/http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BI108/BI108_2007_Groups/group05/pages/baxter.html|archive-date=October 12, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baxter Faces Suit On Dialysis Deaths|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/business/baxter-faces-suit-on-dialysis-deaths.html|access-date=October 12, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 14, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 Chinese heparin adulteration===
{{Main article|2008 Chinese heparin adulteration}}
In 2008, the quality of blood thinning products produced by Baxter was brought into question when they were linked to 19 deaths in the United States.&lt;ref name=time1&gt;{{cite news |title=Heparin's Deadly Side Effects |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1858870,00.html |work=Time magazine |access-date=November 16, 2008 |date=November 13, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121194220/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1858870%2C00.html |archivedate=November 21, 2008 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon inspection, one of the raw ingredients used by Baxter was found to be contaminated – between 5 and 20 percent – with a substance that was similar, but not identical, to the ingredient itself. The company initiated a voluntary recall, temporarily suspended the manufacture of [[heparin]], and launched an investigation.

The investigation into the contamination has focused on raw heparin produced by Changzhou Scientific Protein Laboratories, a China-based branch of [[Scientific Protein Laboratories]], based in [[Waunakee, Wisconsin]]. Due to procedural errors, Changzhou SPL's facilities were never subjected to inspection by US FDA officials, as required by FDA regulations. In addition, Changzhou SPL's products were also never certified as safe for use in pharmaceutical products by Chinese FDA officials, due to Changzhou SPL's registration as a chemical company rather than a pharmaceutical manufacturer.&lt;ref name=wp1&gt;"Contaminant Found in Blood Thinner", ''Washington Post'' (Online edition), March 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters1&gt;"Baxter probe focuses on US-owned China plant – WSJ", Reuters, February 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj1&gt;"China Washes Hands on Heparin Purity", ''Wall Street Journal'' (Online edition) February 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Though Baxter was first to recall heparin because of increased adverse reactions, after the contaminant was identified and testing protocols were shared with other manufacturers globally, over a dozen other companies in nearly a dozen countries issued recalls, which linked back to certain supply points in China.

===2009 Avian flu contamination===
In early 2009, samples of viral material supplied by Baxter International to a series of European laboratories were found to be contaminated with live Avian flu virus ([[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aTo3LbhcA75I | title = Baxter Sent Bird Flu Virus to European Labs by Error | date = February 24, 2009 | access-date = August 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Samples of the less harmful seasonal flu virus (subtype H3N2) were found to be mixed with the deadly H5N1 strain after a vaccine made from the material killed test animals in a lab in the [[Czech Republic]].

===2009 drug cost inflation===
On July 2, 2009, [[Kentucky]] Attorney General [[Jack Conway (politician)|Jack Conway]] announced a settlement between the state and Baxter Healthcare Corporation, a subsidiary of Baxter International, worth $2 million. The company had been inflating the cost of the [[intravenous therapy|intravenous drugs]] sold to Kentucky Medicaid, at times as much as 1300%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.kypost.com/content/news/commonwealth/story/Conway-Announces-Multi-Million-Dollar-Settlement/srxPJ5GaiU2gqFfhozY9-g.cspx | title = Conway Announces Multi-Million Dollar Settlement With Drug Company  | last = Tracy | first  = B | work=[[The Cincinnati Post|Kentucky Post]] | publisher=[[E.

===2010 hepatitis C infections===
In 2010, a jury in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], ordered Baxter and Teva Pharmaceuticals to pay $144 million to patients who had been infected with [[hepatitis C]] after doctors wrongly reused dirty medical supplies to administer [[propofol]] to patients, although the label for propofol clearly states that it is for single-patient use only and that aseptic procedures should be used at all times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-05-08/teva-baxter-will-fight-500-million-in-damages-over-propofol.html "Teva, Baxter Will Fight $500 Million in Damages Over Propofol", ''Business Week'', May 8, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Per a 2009 indemnity agreement between Teva (the manufacturer) and Baxter (acting as a distributor on behalf of Teva), the litigation and related settlements were defended and paid by Teva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.baxter.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=86121&amp;p=irol-reportsannual;|title=2011 annual report, page 87|author=|date=|website=Baxter.com|access-date=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 infusion pump recall===
In 2010, Baxter was ordered by the FDA to recall all of their Colleague infusion pumps from the market due to 87 recalls and deaths associated with the pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FDA Issues Statement on Baxter's Recall of Colleague Infusion Pumps|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm210664.htm|access-date=May 3, 2010|agency=FDA|publisher=FDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008–2010 tax avoidance===
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization [[Public Campaign#Reports|Public Campaign]] criticized Baxter for spending $10.45 million on [[lobbying]] and not paying any taxes during 2008–2010, instead getting $66 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $926 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Portero |first=Ashley |title=30 Major U.S. Corporations Paid More to Lobby Congress Than Income Taxes, 2008–2010 |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/264481/20111209/30-major-u-s-corporations-paid-lobby.htm |publisher=[[International Business Times]] |access-date=December 26, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64D9GyQG0?url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/264481/20111209/30-major-u-s-corporations-paid-lobby.htm |archivedate=December 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, eastbound and westbound speed records are reckoned separately, as the more difficult westbound record voyage, against the [[Gulf Stream]] and the prevailing weather systems, typically results in lower average speeds.

Of the 35 Atlantic liners to hold the Blue Riband, 25 were British, followed by five German, three American, as well as one each from Italy and France. Thirteen were [[Cunard Line|Cunarders]] (plus [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']] of Cunard White Star), 5 by [[White Star Line|White Star]], with 4 owned by [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]], 2 by [[Collins Line|Collins]], 2 by [[Inman Line|Inman]] and 2 by [[Guion Line|Guion]], and one each by [[British and American Steam Navigation Company|British American]], [[Great Western Steamship Company|Great Western]], [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg-America]], the [[Italian Line]], [[Compagnie Générale Transatlantique]] and finally the [[United States Lines]].&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;
The record set by ''[[SS United States|United States]]'' in 1952 remains unbroken by any passenger liner.  The next longest period through which the Blue Riband was retained was 19 years, held from 1909 to 1929 by ''Mauretania''. The shortest period was 6 weeks, by ''Bremen'' from July to August 1933.

Many of these ships were built with substantial government subsidies and were designed with military considerations in mind.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  [[Winston Churchill]] estimated that the two Cunard Queens helped shorten the Second World War by a year.&lt;ref name=graham /&gt;  The last Atlantic liner to hold the Blue Riband, the [[SS United States|SS ''United States'']], was designed for her potential use as a troopship as well as her service as a commercial passenger liner.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

There was no formal award until 1935, when [[Harold Hales|Harold K. Hales]]  donated the [[Hales Trophy]]; though the rules for the Hales Trophy were different from the traditional rules for the Blue Riband (for example, the [[Hales Trophy]] was originally only awarded for westbound records&lt;ref name="Kludas p17"&gt;Kludas p17&lt;/ref&gt;) and changed several times thereafter. It was awarded to just three Blue Riband holders during the express liner era. The trophy continues to be awarded, though many people believe the ''United States'' remains as the holder of the Blue Riband because no subsequent record breaker was in Atlantic passenger service.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

The [[Ocean rowing|Ocean Rowing]] Society inspired by The Blue Riband concept created Blue Riband Trophy of Ocean Rowing awarded to the fastest crew to cross the Atlantic Ocean in an unsupported row boat. Presently it is the most sought after trophy of ocean rowing.&lt;ref name="oceanrowing.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oceanrowing.com/statistics/record_standard.htm|title=ocean rowing world records blue riband trophy|website=www.oceanrowing.com|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The first well-documented crossing of the North Atlantic, though [[List of crossings of the Atlantic Ocean|not the earliest]], was that of [[John Cabot]]'s ship [[Matthew (ship)|''Matthew'']] in the summer of 1497. ''Matthew'' crossed from [[Bristol]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 35 days, returning the following month in just 17 days.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Firstbrook (1997) ''The Voyage of the Matthew'' p118  BBC Books {{ISBN|0 563 38764 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the next three centuries countless vessels (merchant ships and warships, fast and slow, in peace and war) crossed back and forth over the North Atlantic, all subject to the vagaries of wind and weather.  They arrived at port when they could, dependent on the wind, and left when they were loaded, frequently visiting other ports to complete their cargo. During this period eastbound passages of 30 and 45 days were not uncommon, while westward passages of 65 to 90 days excited no attention. It was the advent of the steam ship, with its independence from wind power, which offered the possibility of regular, scheduled Atlantic crossings, in periods of two to three weeks, that opened a new era of transatlantic travel and competition.&lt;ref&gt;Kludas  p33&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term “Blue Riband of the Atlantic” did not come into use until the 1890s, and the history of the trans-Atlantic competition, which was compiled retrospectively, was regarded as starting with the crossings by the steamships [[SS Sirius (1837)|''Sirius'']] and [[SS Great Western|''Great Western'']] in 1838. Although not the first steamships to cross the Atlantic ([[SS Savannah|''Savannah'']] had crossed in 1819, and [[SS Royal William|''Royal William'']] in 1831) nor the fastest to make the crossing (the [[Packet boat|packet]] sailing ship ''Columbia'' crossed west to east in 15 days 23 hours in 1830,&lt;ref&gt;Carl Cutler (1984) ''Greyhounds of the Sea|'' US Naval Institute {{ISBN|978-0850597288}}&lt;/ref&gt; and crossings by sail packets of 16 and 17 days were not unheard of) the ''Sirius'' and ''Great Western'' were the first steamships offering a regular, scheduled trans-Atlantic service; and crucially, they were involved in a race.&lt;ref&gt;Kludas p36-37&lt;/ref&gt; Cunard refused officially to recognise the title because racing vessels was not in line with the company's safety policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Transatlantic Liners|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/archive/rtf/Ships-Great%20Transatlantic%20Liners%2C%20The%20no8.rtf|website=Maritime Archives|publisher=Merseyside Maritime Museum|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paddlers (1838–72)===

[[File:SS Sirius (1837).jpg|thumb|''Sirius'' is considered the first Atlantic record-holder for her 1838 voyage to New York at {{convert|8.03|kn|km/h}}.]]
[[File:Great Western maiden voyage.jpg|thumb|In 1843, ''Great Western'' recorded a record-breaking voyage of {{convert|10.03|kn|km/h}}.]]
The idea of building a line of transatlantic steamships was mooted in 1832 by Junius Smith, American lawyer turned London merchant. The idea came to him during an Atlantic crossing which took 57 days, a not unusual occurrence,&lt;ref&gt;Kludas p36&lt;/ref&gt; and it was published in the ''American Rail Road Journal''.&lt;ref name=pond&gt;{{cite book | last = Pond | first = Edgar LeRoy | coauthors = | title = Janius Smith | location =  | publisher=| year = 1927 | oclc = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving no support for several years, his plan gained credibility when Scottish shipbuilder, [[Macgregor Laird]] became an investor.&lt;ref name=fox /&gt;  Smith, who is often considered the ''Father of the Atlantic Liner'', formed the [[British and American Steam Navigation Company]] to operate a London-New York service. About the same time, the question of Atlantic steamships was discussed at an 1835 director's meeting of the newly formed Great Western Railway when the line’s chief engineer, [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] supposedly joked that the line could be made longer by building a steamship to run between Bristol and New York. The necessary investors were recruited by Brunel's friend, Thomas Guppy, a Bristol engineer and businessman.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite book | last = American Heritage | first =  | title = The Annihilation of Time and Space | location =  | publisher=| year = 1991 | oclc = | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next year, the [[Great Western Steamship Company]] was established, even though the rail line was still years from completion.&lt;ref name=corlett&gt;{{cite book | last = Corlett | first = Ewan | title = The Iron Ship: the Story of Brunel's ss Great Britain | location =  | publisher=Conway | year = 1975 | oclc = | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By spring 1838, Brunel’s {{SS|Great Western||2}} was ready for sea, but Smith’s first ship was still without engines. When Great Western scheduled its initial sailing, Laird suggested that British and American charter the Irish Sea steamer {{SS|Sirius|1837|2}} from the St. George Steam Packet Company for two voyages to beat Great Western.&lt;ref name=heritage /&gt;  While the ''Sirius'' left [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Ireland four days before ''Great Western'' departed [[Avonmouth]], ''Great Western'' still came within a day of overtaking ''Sirius'' to New York.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  To complete the voyage, ''Sirius'' was forced to burn spars when coal ran low.&lt;ref name=heritage /&gt;  With her westbound crossing at  8.03 [[Knots (speed)|knots]] (14.87 [[km/h]]), ''Sirius'' is often considered the first record holder even though the notion would not be used for several generations.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  ''Great Western'' herself became the prototype for all successful wooden paddlers and made a record-breaking voyage at {{convert|10.03|kn|km/h}} as late as 1843.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

[[File:RMS Europa.jpg|thumb|right|''Europa'' of 1848 set the record with a voyage of {{convert|11.79|kn|km/h}}. This is one of the earliest known photos of an Atlantic steamship.]]
The [[Cunard Line]] started its Liverpool-Halifax-Boston service in 1840 with the four ships that were slightly reduced versions of ''Great Western'' with about the same speed. Ultimately Cunard built nine additional wood paddlers. By 1846, Cunard was the only original steamship line that survived, largely because of its subsidy from the British [[Admiralty]] to carry the mails&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt; and its emphasis on safety.&lt;ref name=graham&gt;{{cite book | last = Maxtone-Graham | first = John | title = The Only Way To Cross | location =  | publisher=Collier | year = 1972 | oclc = | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until 1850, the record passed between various Cunarders, finally reaching {{convert|12.25|kn|km/h}} for an 8-day Liverpool-Halifax crossing by ''Asia''.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  Record voyages during this period were often the result of using sails to gain extra speed from a following gale.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

Cunard's first serious competition for the record came from the American-owned [[Collins Line]].&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  The American Government supplied Collins with a substantial subsidy to operate four wooden paddlers that were superior to Cunard's best.&lt;ref name=fry&gt;{{cite book | last = Fry | first = Henry | title = The History of North Atlantic Steam Navigation with Some Account of Early Ships and Shipowners| location = London | publisher=Sampson, Low &amp; Marston | year = 1896 | oclc = 271397492 | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first year, 1850, the {{SS|Pacific|1849|2}} set the record at {{convert|12.46|kn|km/h}} on a 10-day run from Liverpool to New York. Unfortunately, Collins suffered a setback when its {{SS|Arctic||2}} foundered with heavy loss of life.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  The next year, Cunard put further pressure on Collins by commissioning its first iron-hulled paddler, the [[RMS Persia|''Persia'']], which set a new record with a 9-day, 16-hour Liverpool-New York voyage at {{convert|13.11|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  During the [[Crimean War]], Cunard supplied eleven of its ships for war service and suspended all routes except the Liverpool-Halifax-Boston service.&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;  While the Collins' fortunes improved because of the lack of competition during the war, Collins collapsed in 1858 after the loss of two additional steamers.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  Cunard emerged as the leading carrier of first class passengers and in 1862 commissioned the [[RMS Scotia|''Scotia'']], the last paddle steamer to set a record with a Queenstown-New York voyage at {{convert|14.46|kn|km/h}}.  ''Scotia'' was the final significant paddler ordered for the Atlantic because under the terms of Cunard's mail contract with the Admiralty, it was still required to supply paddle steamers when needed for military service.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

===Single screw steamers (1872–89)===
[[File:Adriatic (1871).jpg|thumb|White Star's ''Adriatic'' by George Parker Greenwood. She was the first successful screw liner with an 1872 run at {{convert|14.65|kn|km/h}}]]
[[File:RMS Etruria.jpg|thumb|Cunard's ''Etruria'' of 1885, averaged {{convert|19.56|kn|km/h}} on a record-breaking 1888 crossing]]

In 1845, Brunel’s {{SS|Great Britain||2}} became the first iron-hulled screw liner on the Atlantic. Starting in 1850, the [[Inman Line]] built numerous reduced versions for the [[steerage (deck)|steerage]] trade. In 1866, Inman started to commission single screw express liners that were the equal of ''Scotia''.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  The Admiralty allowed Cunard to order its first screw express liner, the ''Russia''.&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;  In 1871 both companies faced a new rival when the [[White Star Line]] commissioned [[RMS Oceanic (1870)|''Oceanic'']] and her five sisters. The following year, White Star’s ''Adriatic'' finally surpassed ''Scotia'' with a voyage at {{convert|14.65|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  The new White Star record breakers were especially economical because of their use of compound engines, but their high ratio of length to beam (10:1 compared to the previous norm of 8:1) increased vibration. To counter this, White Star placed the dining saloon midships and made their ships more luxurious. Inman rebuilt its express fleet to the new standard, but Cunard lagged behind both of its rivals.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  In 1875, Inman’s new [[SS City of Berlin|''City of Berlin'']] averaged {{convert|15.21|kn|km/h}} on its record-breaking voyage.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

During the five-year [[Panic of 1873|shipping depression]] that began in 1873, William Pearce, the controlling partner of the [[Fairfield Shipbuilding|John Elder shipyard]], became convinced that a crack steamer that carried only passengers and light freight could be profitable because she would attract more passengers and spend less time in port.&lt;ref name=fox /&gt;  He proposed a ship that crammed the most powerful machinery possible into the hull, sacrificing everything to speed.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  When Cunard rejected his proposal, Pearce offered his idea to the [[Guion Line]], a firm primarily engaged in the steerage trade. The first ship Pearce built for Guion, the [[SS Arizona|''Arizona'']] was described as a "souped up transatlantic hot rod" by one nautical historian.&lt;ref name=fox /&gt;  While she only won the eastbound record,&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;  two years later, Guion took delivery of the even faster ''Alaska'' that set the record at {{convert|16.07|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  To continue the program, Pearce offered Guion favourable terms on a third unit, the [[SS Oregon (1883)|''Oregon'']], which raised the record to {{convert|18.56|kn|km/h}} in 1884.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  These ships were uncomfortable and their excessive coal consumption made them uneconomic.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  However, for a while they were popular with American clients because of their American ownership.&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;

After being out of the contest for a decade, Cunard finally started to rebuild. In 1884, Cunard purchased ''Oregon'' from the Guion line when that firm defaulted on payments to the shipyard. Later that year, Cunard commissioned the first steel-hulled record-breakers, [[RMS Umbria|''Umbria'']] and [[RMS Etruria|''Etruria'']].&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;  ''Etruria'', the faster of the pair, raised the record to {{convert|19.56|kn|km/h}} on a 6-day, 2-hour run from Queenstown to Sandy Hook in 1888. However, ''Etruria'' and her sister represented the limit of single screw technology.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

===Double screw steamers (1889–1907)===
[[File:City of paris.jpg|thumb|Inman's ''City of Paris'' set a record of {{convert|20.01|kn|km/h}} in 1889.]]
[[File:Kaiser wilhelm der grosse 01.jpg|thumb|NDL's ''Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse'' raised the record to {{convert|22.29|kn|km/h}} in 1898]]
The Inman line fell on hard times after their intended record-breaker, ''City of Rome'' failed to meet expectations and was returned to her builders in 1882. Inman directors agreed to voluntary liquidation so that the largest creditor, the Philadelphia-based [[International Navigation Company]] could purchase Inman's assets.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  The new owners provided the capital to build two outstanding record breakers, the twin screw {{SS|City of New York||2}} and the {{SS|City of Paris|1888|2}}. Starting in 1889, the later ship set the record on four occasions, including a voyage at {{convert|20.7|kn|km/h}} in 1892. White Star, which had not built an express liner since the {{SS|Germanic|1875|2}} of 1875, commissioned the record-breaker, {{SS|Teutonic|1889|2}} of 1889 and {{SS|Majestic|1890|2}} of 1890 after receiving a subsidy from the [[Admiralty]] to make the pair available as merchant cruisers in the event of hostilities. Cunard countered with two even faster ships, the [[RMS Campania|''Campania'']] and the [[RMS Lucania|''Lucania'']] of 1893.&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;  The next year, ''Lucania'' recorded a voyage at {{convert|21.81|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  Inman became the [[American Line]] and ordered two additional express liners from American yards, but no attempt was made to best the new Cunarders. In 1894, Guion ceased sailing as its ships were now hopelessly outdated.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

No sooner had Cunard reestablished its supremacy than new rivals emerged. Beginning in the late 1860s, several German firms commissioned liners that were almost as fast as the British mail steamers working from Liverpool.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  In 1889, the [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg-America Line]] commissioned four double screw steamers capable of {{convert|18.00|kn|km/h}}. Its rival, [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] (NDL) lagged behind until 1895 when it ordered two ships intended to take the record. In 1898, the {{SS|Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse||2}} raised the record to {{convert|22.29|kn|km/h}}, while the other liner, ''Kaiser Friedrich'' failed to achieve her contract speed and was returned to her builders. Hamburg America ordered the even more powerful {{SS|Deutschland|1900|2}} that reached {{convert|23.06|kn|km/h}} on one of her record-breaking 1900 voyages. However, Hamburg America quickly learned that these high powered double screw liners had vibration problems. ''Deutschland'' had the unpleasant nickname, "cocktail shaker" and actually lost part of her stern in 1902 because of the constant vibration.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

Rather than match the new German speedsters, White Star decided to drop out of the competition and commission the four large ''Celtic''-class luxury liners of more moderate speed. White Star realised that passengers preferred comfort even if this means spending an extra day at sea. In 1902, White Star joined the well capitalised American combine, the [[International Mercantile Marine Co.]] (IMM) that owned the American Line and others. IMM also had trade agreements with Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. After its bad experience with the ''Deutschland'', Hamburg America also dropped out of the race and commissioned large luxury liners based on the ''Celtic''. However, NDL completed building a fleet of four additional express liners modelled on ''Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse''.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

===Ships of state (1907–69)===
[[File:RMS Mauretania.jpg|thumb|Cunard's ''Mauretania'' held the Blue Riband from 1909 to 1929 at {{convert|26.06|kn|km/h}}]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-11081, Schnelldamper "Bremen".jpg|thumb|NDL's ''Bremen'' finally broke ''Mauretania'''s record in 1929 by averaging {{convert|27.83|kn|km/h}}]]
[[File:B-17s flyby Rex.jpg|thumb|The Italian ''Rex'' joined the Blue Riband club with a 1933 voyage of {{convert|28.92|kn|km/h}}]]
[[File:SS-Normandie side01 NYC.jpg|thumb|CGT's ''Normandie'' won the Blue Riband at {{convert|30.58|kn|km/h}} in 1937.]]
[[File:Rms queen mary 2008.jpg|thumb|Cunard White Star's ''Queen Mary'' regained the Blue Riband at {{convert|30.99|kn|km/h}} in 1938.]]
[[File:SS United States postcard.jpg|thumb|''United States'' won the Blue Riband at {{convert|34.51|kn|km/h}} in 1952. Formally, she still holds the title.]]
After 1902, only the Cunard Line and the French [[Compagnie Générale Transatlantique]] (CGT) were independent of the IMM combine. British prestige was at stake, and the Government provided Cunard with an annual subsidy of £150,000 plus a low interest loan of £2.5&amp;nbsp;million to pay for the construction of the two [[Superliner (passenger ship)|superliners]], [[RMS Lusitania|''Lusitania'']] and [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|''Mauretania'']] under the condition that they be available for conversion to armed cruisers when needed by the navy.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  Starting in 1907, both ships won the Blue Riband and ''Mauretania’s'' 1909 record of {{convert|26.06|kn|km/h}} stood for 20 years.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  However, these ships paid a price for speed and lacked many of the amenities found in the new White Star and Hamburg American luxury liners. Both Cunard rivals ordered a trio of even bigger luxury liners, the White Star [[Olympic class ocean liner|''Olympic''-class]] capable of {{convert|21.5|kn|km/h}} and Hapag [[SS Imperator|''Imperator''-class]] capable of {{convert|22.5|kn|km/h}}. Even Cunard chose this approach when it ordered its third superliner, the [[RMS Aquitania|''Aquitania'']].&lt;ref name=graham /&gt;

There is a persistent rumor that {{RMS|Titanic}} was attempting to win the Blue Riband and that such effort resulted in excessive speed and collision with the iceberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maltin|first1=Tim|last2=Aston|first2=Eloise|title=101 things you thought you knew about the Titanic-- but didn't!|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0143119098|pages=43-47}}Chapter 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a rumor is undoubtedly false, as the Titanic was built for luxury not speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanic-titanic.com/titanic_myths.shtml|title=Titanic Myths|author=|date=|website=www.titanic-titanic.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the war, Hamburg American and Norddeutscher Lloyd lost their premier units. In 1926, the U.S. Government awarded Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL) $27&amp;nbsp;million in compensation for its confiscated liners. By this time, improvements in turbine technology and hull form along with the use of fuel oil instead of coal made it possible to build more civilised record breakers. Using these funds, NDL ordered two ships designed to cross the Atlantic in five days, the {{SS|Bremen|1929|2}} and {{SS|Europa|1930|2}}. However, the American government netted the award against debts owed by the German Government and Berlin was forced to directly subsidise NDL to continue the project.  ''Bremen'' recorded {{convert|27.83|kn|km/h}} on her 1929 Blue Riband voyage and ''Europa'' increased the Blue Riband to {{convert|27.92|kn|km/h}} in 1933.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

In 1928, as Britain's response to the German {{SS|Bremen|1929|2}} and {{SS|Europa|1930|2}}, the [[White Star Line]] ordered a new Diesel-electric 1000-ft long ocean liner to be named [[Oceanic (unfinished ship)|''Oceanic'']] capable of  200,000 SHP. Construction started June 28, 1928. However, White Star did not have the funds to complete the liner. Oceanic's construction was put on hold until 1931 when her keel was silently scrapped. Oceanic's ahead-of-their-time engines would have been powerful enough to enable her to possibly win the Blue Riband.

In 1929, two lines from Italy each ordered a ship based on the German pair. Just as these ships were being completed, the Italian government nationalised the shipping industry, creating the [[Italian Line]]. While both superliners were successful, only the {{SS|Rex||2}} won the Blue Riband, with a 1933 voyage at {{convert|28.92|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

CGT also ordered a new superliner in 1929. The next year, Cunard started construction on an 80,000 ton liner that was to be the first of two record breakers fast enough to fit into a two ship weekly Southampton-New York service.&lt;ref name=graham /&gt; Consequently, CGT altered its plans to make its new liner even bigger.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  However, as the 1929 shipping depression intensified, construction on Cunard’s hull 534 was halted while work on the heavily subsidised French ship continued. By 1934, both Cunard and White Star lines were failing and the British Government was concerned about potential job losses. Therefore, the government agreed to give Cunard a loan of £3&amp;nbsp;million to complete hull 534 as the {{RMS|Queen Mary||2}} and an additional £5&amp;nbsp;million to build a second ship, the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth||2}} only if Cunard merged with White Star.&lt;ref name=graham /&gt;

CGT's {{SS|Normandie||2}} entered service in 1935 and won the Blue Riband at {{convert|29.98|kn|km/h}}.  ''Queen Mary'' was commissioned the next year, and after a few break-in voyages, took the Blue Riband to {{convert|30.14|kn|km/h}}. The two liners were operated a pair and traded the Blue Riband again, with the Cunard White Star Liner ultimately posting {{convert|30.99|kn|km/h}} in 1938.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt; ''Queen Mary’s'' consort, ''Queen Elizabeth'', was commissioned after war was declared and was never allowed to attempt the record.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

In 1935, [[Harold Hales|Harold K. Hales]] (1868–1942), a member of the UK Parliament and owner of a shipping company, commissioned [[Hales Trophy|a large trophy]] to be presented to the fastest ship crossing the Atlantic, in order to formalize the rules surrounding the trans Atlantic competition. The rules for the trophy did not correspond to the traditional rules for the Blue Riband in that the trophy was to be awarded only to surface passenger ship achieving the fastest speed in the westbound direction.&lt;ref name="Kludas p17"/&gt; Other rule changes further complicated the situation, and eventually the trophy was awarded to just three Blue Riband holders; ''Rex'', in 1935, ''Normandie'' in 1936, and ''United States'' in 1952.

Of the ships of state, only ''Queen Mary'', ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Europa'' survived the war. ''Europa'' became CGT's ''Liberte'' and no attempt was made to retain her former speed when she was reconstructed.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  However, the United States government was impressed by the large numbers of troops carried by the Queens during the war, and ordered a superliner that was as much a troop carrier as an express liner. On her maiden voyage in 1952, the [[SS United States|''United States'']] upped the Blue Riband to {{convert|34.51|kn|km/h}}. In 1958, the transatlantic airlines put jet transports into service and the days of the record breakers were numbered.

With the success of ''United States'' in 1952 and Cunard's decision not to challenge the new record the Blue Riband contest again subsided. There was a growing recognition that the era of fast crossings by express liners was becoming a thing of the past, and that the contest for fast transatlantic travel was shifting to the air.&lt;ref name=Times8752&gt;[http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/newspaperRetrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=DateAscend&amp;tabID=T003&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchId=R1&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=13&amp;qrySerId=Locale%28en%2C%2C%29%3AFQE%3D%28tx%2CNone%2C11%29Blue+Riband%3AAnd%3ALQE%3D%28da%2CNone%2C23%2901%2F01%2F1952+-+12%2F31%2F1952%3AAnd%3ALQE%3D%28MB%2CNone%2C8%29%22TTDA-1%22%24&amp;retrieveFormat=MULTIPAGE_DOCUMENT&amp;userGroupName=livlibtda&amp;inPS=true&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;&amp;docId=&amp;docLevel=FASCIMILE&amp;workId=&amp;relevancePageBatch=CS117919464&amp;contentSet=UDVIN&amp;callistoContentSet=UDVIN&amp;docPage=article&amp;hilite=y The Blue Riband]: Editorial, 8 July 1952, [[The Times]]; retrieved 31 July 12017&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, air travel was already competing with the express liners for fast Atlantic crossings; in 1936 the German company DELAG commenced an airship service to New York, their [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|''Hindenburg'']] crossing from Europe to America in times ranging from 53 to 78 hours, and the following year, while  experimenting with a flying boat service, Empire Airways [[Short Empire#Operational history|''Caledonia'']] reduced this to 15 hours.
In the post-war period times were reduced again by  the advent of land based airliners, such as the [[Lockheed Constellation]]. Hopes in 1952 were expressed for the new [[de Havilland Comet]] jetliner,&lt;ref name=Times8752/&gt; though these were dashed by [[de Havilland Comet#Early hull losses|the succession of crashes]] that halted the Comet programme. A regular jetliner service was finally introduced in 1958 with the [[Boeing 707]] and the [[Douglas DC-8|DC 8]], cutting the crossing to 7 hours. The final step in the quest for trans-Atlantic speed was the [[BAC Concorde]], which set a record in 1996 of a second under two hours 53 minutes, at an average speed of 1250&amp;nbsp;mph (Mach 1.9),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/60at60/2015/8/1996-fastest-flight-across-the-atlantic-in-a-commercial-aircraft-392882 1996: Fastest flight across the Atlantic in a commercial aircraft] at [[Guinness World Records]], retrieved 30 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; but by this time airlines were aware that cost and comfort were more important to passengers than speed, and the emphasis shifted to aircraft like the [[Boeing 747]], with a sleeper capacity for business passengers.

At sea ''United States'' record stood until 1986, when it was challenged by British entrepreneur [[Richard Branson]], and his  high-speed motor vessel, ''Virgin Atlantic Challenger''. Despite having to stop to refuel on several occasions, Branson shaved two hours off the record, increasing the average speed to 36.4 knots. However, as '' Virgin Atlantic Challenger'' was not a passenger vessel the New York Maritime Museum refused to part with the Hales Trophy, so Branson inaugurated the [[Virgin Atlantic Challenge Trophy]], for the fastest unqualified Atlantic crossing, open to all challengers. Three years later this was won by Tom Gentry, whose ''Gentry Eagle'' slashed the record, crossing in 62 hours at an average 47.4 knots. 
In 1992 the Virgin Atlantic Challenge was again won, by the [[Aga Khan]]'s ''[[Destriero]]'' crossing in 58 hour 34 minutes and averaging 53.09 knots. She also made a record-breaking return journey, winning the [[Columbus Atlantic Trophy]], posted by the yacht club in response to the Virgin Atlantic Challenge for the fastest two-way voyage i.e. a single crossing and return voyage within a specified time.

Meanwhile, [[Incat]], builders of fast catamaran ferries, and therefore indisputably commercial vessels, decided to make an attempt to win the Hales Trophy, for which the record was still that of  ''United States''. This was achieved in 1990 by ''[[Hoverspeed Great Britain]]'', with a non-stop crossing of 79 hours 54 minutes, averaging 36.6 knots and Incat were awarded the trophy by the Hales Trophy Committee. Eight years later this record was broken by another Incat vessel, ''[[Catalonia (ship)|Catalonia]]'' and again the following month by ''[[Cat-Link V]]''.

The [[Ocean rowing|Ocean Rowing]] Society inspired by The Blue Riband concept created Blue Riband Trophy of Ocean Rowing awarded to the fastest crew to cross the Atlantic Ocean in an unsupported row boat. Presently it is the most sought after trophy of Ocean Rowing.&lt;ref name="oceanrowing.com"/&gt;

With the end of the express liners era the Blue Riband has become an item of largely historical interest, with some authors regarding the ''United States'' as the last holder of the accolade;&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt; meanwhile the goal of the fastest Atlantic crossings remains a physical and technological challenge and at least three awards for the feat remain in play.

==List of record breakers==
The following is the latest consensus list of the research to date. Because there was no sanctioning body for the Blue Riband, researchers are limited to surviving shipping company archives and press reports to develop the list of Blue Riband winners. These lists are retrospective, and limited to steamships only. Therefore, most lists feature ''Sirius'', in her race with ''Great Western'' in 1838, as the first record-holder, although her crossing was not as fast as some sail packet ships of the period. Early writers including Arthur Maginnus (1892), Henry Frey (1896), Charles Lee (1931) and C. R. Benstead (1936) were the standard sources until the 1950s. Since then, C. R. Vernon Gibbs (1952),&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt; and Noel Bonsor (1975) added to the body of knowledge, with additional detail about the German ships provided by Arnold Kludas.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

Over the years, the lists have not agreed. For example, Gibbs credits Inman's ''City of Paris'' with an 1866 Blue Riband voyage, and Cunard's ''Russia'' with an eastbound record the following year because he considered as dubious ''Scotia's'' Blue Riband claim of {{convert|14.46|kn|km/h}}, supposedly based on a very long track.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  Later writers have included the ''Scotia'' claim.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  Gibbs also includes the claimed Blue Riband voyage at {{convert|17.6|kn|km/h}} of the National Line's ''America'' of 1884&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt; that was not confirmed by later researchers.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

'''CNN Business Traveller''' is a monthly television program on [[CNN International]] hosted by [[Richard Quest]].

The program was launched in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jun/22/richard-quest-cnn-means-business|title='I can't turn the clock back' |work=The Guardian|date=22 June 2009|accessdate=18 June 2016|first=Gareth|last=McLean}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the program investigates various topics related to business related travel, including [[airlines]], [[airport lounge]]s, [[frequent-flyer program]]s, hotels and the travelling lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btnews.co.uk/article/9848|title=Article from BTNews 1 FEBRUARY 2016|date=1 February 2016|accessdate=18 June 2016|work=BTN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hmhhotelgroup.com/pressandmedia/article/248|title=HMH CEO LAURENT A. VOIVENEL ON THE CNN BUSINESS TRAVELLER SHOW|work=HMH Hotel Group|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Williams was also a producer and occasional presenter on the program, before being given his own CNN program in 2016 titled ''[[In 24 Hours]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2016/03/dream-job-for-cnns-james-williams.html|title=Dream job for CNN’s James Williams|work=[[TV Tonight]]|first=David|last=Knox|date=1 March 2016|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://enter.hermesawards.com/entry/cnn-business-traveller-concur-interview/|title=CNN Business Traveller Concur Interview|work=Grayling|accessdate=18 June 2016|dead-url=no|archivedate=18 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618024135/https://enter.hermesawards.com/entry/cnn-business-traveller-concur-interview/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the program attempted a stunt to fly around the world travelling only on [[low cost carriers]], comparing experiences on each airline and interviewing executives from the carriers over two episodes of ''CNN Business Traveller''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2016/05/cnn-business-traveller-visits-sydney.html|title=CNN Business Traveller visits Sydney|date=8 May 2016|accessdate=18 June 2016|work=[[TV Tonight]]|first=David|last=Knox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quest travelled on 10 airlines, through 9 countries across 8 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiantvawards.com/2016/04/cnn-business-traveller-goes-round-the-world-with-richard-quest/|title=CNN Business Traveller goes round the world with Richard Quest|date=11 April 2016|accessdate=18 June 2016|work=Asian Television Awards|first=James|last=Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crumar''' was an Italian electronic musical instrument manufacturer established by Mario Crucianelli in the late 1960s,&lt;ref name=bassi&gt;{{citation |last=Bassi |first=Enrico |year=2005/2007 |title=Crumar Museum |url=http://www.enricobassi.it/crumar.htm |language=Italian |accessdate=3 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003003628/http://www.enricobassi.it/crumar.htm |archivedate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which manufactured [[synthesizer]]s and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] during the 70s and 80s. Its name stands for "'''CRU'''cianelli and '''MAR'''chetti", the names of Crucianelli and business partner Marchetti.&lt;ref name=bassi/&gt;  The company appears to have grown out of the Crucianelli accordion company and also continued to manufacture accordions under both names.

== History and products ==
Crumar started out manufacturing [[electronic piano]]s and string synthesizers, such as the Compac-piano (1972/1973), Compac-string (1973), Pianoman (1974) and Stringman (1974), the functions of which were combined  in 1975 with the Multiman (also known as the Orchestrator), and in 1977 with the Multiman-S.&lt;ref name="bassi" /&gt; The company was also known for "clonewheel" organs made in the 70's and 80's, such as the Organizer (1974), Organizer T1 (1978) and T1/C (1981), T2 (1978), and T3 (1981).&lt;ref name="bassi" /&gt;

In 1978, Crumar released their first full-fledged synthesizer, the DS-2, which had one of the earliest [[digitally controlled oscillator]]s (DCO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bassi |first=Enrico |title=Crumar DS-2 Reverse Engineering |url=http://www.enricobassi.it/crumar_ds_2.htm |publisher=Ebax Sinthy Production |accessdate=3 January 2014 |language=Italian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229191901/http://www.enricobassi.it/crumar_ds_2.htm |archivedate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Crumar [[synthesizer]]s are comparable and contemporaneous to [[Moog synthesizer]]s and other [[analog synthesizer]]s; in fact, the Crumar Spirit synthesizer (1983) was designed by [[Bob Moog]] himself, along with [[Minimoog]] co-designer Jim Scott and Tom Rhea (who wrote Moog manuals).&lt;ref name="sos2001"&gt;{{citation |last=Reid |first=Gordon |year=2001 |title=Spiritual Enlightenment &amp;ndash; Crumar Spirit Analogue Monosynth (retro) |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul01/articles/retrocrumer.asp |journal=Sound On Sound |issue=July 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225101431/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul01/articles/retrocrumer.asp |archivedate=2011-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984,&lt;ref name="bassi" /&gt; Crumar began producing polyphonic synthesizers utilizing DCOs under the Bit name (Unique in the US)''.''&lt;ref name="sos2001" /&gt;  The Performer is a polyphonic analog Strings and Brass machine produced at the end of the 1970s and is slightly compact with just 49 keys and is fully polyphonic (can play all 49 notes simultaneously). Programming is simple and clearly laid-out with just 15 sliders and a few buttons. A solid black chassis and wood end-cheeks round out this classic and often overlooked string machine.  The Performer is best remembered for its Strings more so than its Brass and was used by [[Duran Duran]].

In the early '80's, Crumar formed a design/distribution collaborative with New York-based Music Technology (MT) in an effort to commercialize the [[Bell Labs Digital Synthesizer]]. Crumar and the MT designers worked in conjunction with some respected names in electronic music to produce the Crumar [[Bell Labs Digital Synthesizer#Influence|GDS]] (General Development System)&lt;ref name="gds"&gt;{{citation |title=CRUMAR/DKI GDS SYSTEM &amp; SYNERGY |url=http://www.synthony.com/vintage/dkigds.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970115154934/http://www.synthony.com/vintage/dkigds.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1997-01-15 |work=Synthony.com |accessdate=2014-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1980, and the Digital keyboards [[Bell Labs Digital Synthesizer#Influence|Synergy]]&lt;ref name="synergy"&gt;{{citation |author=Aaron Lanterman |title=Digital Keyboards Synergy Preservation Page |url=http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~lanterma/synergy/ |accessdate=2014-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1981. These synthesizers, which used [[additive synthesis]] technology and [[phase modulation]], were bulky and cumbersome, but were state-of-the-art at the time. The complexity of this project, along with Japanese competition (notably from the [[Yamaha DX7]]) contributed to the company's eventual downfall.

Crumar ceased trading in 1987, just as they were about to launch a high-quality sampler at the lower end of the market.

In 2008 the Crumar brand was acquired by a new Italian company that soon began producing new keyboards under the Crumar name, including the Baby Grand piano (introduced at the 2008 [[Musikmesse]]), Bassman bass synth, and Mojo clonewheel organ.

In 2018 a digital electric piano called Seven was introduced. It featured modern day technology in a wooden vintage 1970's style case.

'''Dimensional modeling''' (DM) is part of the ''Business Dimensional Lifecycle'' methodology developed by [[Ralph Kimball]] which includes a set of methods, techniques and concepts for use in [[data warehouse]] design.&lt;ref name="ConBegg9"/&gt;{{rp|1258-1260}}&lt;ref name="MoodyKokink-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neumann.hec.ca/sites/cours/6-060-00/MK_entreprise.pdf|title=From Enterprise Models to Dimensional Models: A Methodology for Data Warehouse and Data Mart Design|id=Dimensional Modelling|access-date=3 July 2018|first1=Daniel L.|last1=Moody|first2=Mark A.R.|last2=Kortink|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517164505/http://neumann.hec.ca/sites/cours/6-060-00/MK_entreprise.pdf|archive-date=17 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The approach focuses on identifying the key business processes within a business and modelling and implementing these first before adding additional business processes, a bottom-up approach.&lt;ref name="ConBegg9"/&gt;{{rp|1258-1260}}  An alternative approach from [[Bill Inmon|Inmon]] advocates a top down design of the model of all the enterprise data using tools such as [[entity-relationship model]]ing (ER).&lt;ref name="ConBegg9"&gt;{{cite book|title=Database Systems - A Practical Approach to Design, Implementation and Management|first1=Thomas|last1=Connolly|first2=Carolyn|last2=Begg|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-1-292-06118-4|edition=6th|at=Part 9 Business Intellence|date=26 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1258-1260}}

==Description==

Dimensional modeling always uses the concepts of facts (measures), and dimensions (context). Facts are typically (but not always) numeric values that can be aggregated, and dimensions are groups of hierarchies and descriptors that define the facts. For example, sales amount is a fact; timestamp, product, register#, store#, etc. are elements of dimensions. Dimensional models are built by business process area, e.g. store sales, inventory, claims, etc. Because the different business process areas share some but not all dimensions, efficiency in design, operation, and consistency, is achieved using [[Dimension (data warehouse)#Types|conformed dimensions]], i.e. using one copy of the shared dimension across subject areas.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Dimensional modeling does not necessarily involve a relational database. The same modeling approach, at the logical level, can be used for any physical form, such as multidimensional database or even flat files.  It is oriented around understandability and performance.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Design method==

&lt;!-- ==Dimensional modeling process== --&gt;

=== Designing the model ===

The dimensional model is built on a [[star schema|star-like schema]] or [[snowflake schema]], with dimensions surrounding the fact table.&lt;ref name="lifecycle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Golfarelli"/&gt; To build the schema, the following design model is used:

#Choose the business process
#Declare the grain
#Identify the dimensions
#Identify the fact

;Choose the business process:
The process of dimensional modeling builds on a 4-step design method that helps to ensure the usability of the dimensional model and the use of the [[data warehouse]]. The basics in the design build on the actual business process which the [[data warehouse]] should cover. Therefore, the first step in the model is to describe the business process which the model builds on. This could for instance be a sales situation in a retail store. To describe the business process, one can choose to do this in plain text or use basic Business Process Modeling Notation ([[BPMN]]) or other design guides like the Unified Modeling Language ([[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]).

;Declare the grain:
After describing the business process, the next step in the design is to declare the grain of the model. The grain of the model is the exact description of what the dimensional model should be focusing on. This could for instance be “An individual line item on a customer slip from a retail store”. To clarify  what the grain means,  you should pick the central process and describe it with one sentence. Furthermore, the grain (sentence) is what you are going to build your dimensions and fact table from. You might find it necessary to go back to this step to alter the grain due to new information gained on what your model is supposed to be able to deliver.

;Identify the dimensions:
The third step in the design process is to define the dimensions of the model. The dimensions must be defined within the grain from the second step of the 4-step process. Dimensions are the foundation of the fact table, and is where the data for the fact table is collected. Typically dimensions are nouns like date, store, inventory etc. These dimensions are where all the data is stored. For example, the date dimension could contain data such as year, month and weekday.

;Identify the facts:
After defining the dimensions, the next step in the process is to make keys for the fact table. This step is to identify the numeric facts that will populate each fact table row. This step is closely related to the business users of the system, since this is where they get access to data stored in the [[data warehouse]]. Therefore, most of the fact table rows are numerical, additive figures such as quantity or cost per unit, etc.

=== Dimension Normalization ===
{{NPOV section|date=June 2018}}
Dimensional normalization or snowflaking removes redundant attributes, which are known in the normal flatten de-normalized dimensions. Dimensions are strictly joined together in sub dimensions. 
 
Snowflaking has an influence on the data structure that differs from many philosophies of data warehouses.&lt;ref name="Golfarelli"/&gt;
Single data (fact) table surrounded by multiple descriptive (dimension) tables

Developers often don't normalize dimensions due to several reasons:&lt;ref name= "refname4"/&gt;

#Normalization makes the data structure more complex
#Performance can be slower, due to the many joins between tables
#The space savings are minimal
#[[Bitmap index]]es can't be used
#Query performance. [[Third normal form|3NF databases]] suffer from performance problems when aggregating or retrieving many dimensional values that may require analysis. If you are only going to do operational reports then you may be able to get by with 3NF because your operational user will be looking for very fine grain data.

There are some arguments on why normalization can be useful.&lt;ref name="Golfarelli"/&gt; It can be an advantage when part of hierarchy is common to more than one dimension. For example, a geographic dimension may be reusable because both the customer and supplier dimensions use it.

== Benefits of dimensional modeling ==
{{third-party|section|date=June 2018}}
Benefits of the dimensional model are the following:&lt;ref name="refname5"/&gt;
* Understandability. Compared to the normalized model, the dimensional model is easier to understand and more intuitive. In dimensional models, information is grouped into coherent business categories or dimensions, making it easier to read and interpret. Simplicity also allows software to navigate databases efficiently.  In normalized models, data is divided into many discrete entities and even a simple business process might result in dozens of tables joined together in a complex way. 
* Query performance. Dimensional models are more denormalized and optimized for data querying, while normalized models seek to eliminate data redundancies and are optimized for transaction loading and updating.  The predictable framework of a dimensional model allows the database to make strong assumptions about the data which may have a positive impact on performance.  Each dimension is an equivalent entry point into the fact table, and this symmetrical structure allows effective handling of complex queries.  Query optimization for star-joined databases is simple, predictable, and controllable.
* Extensibility. Dimensional models are scalable and easily accommodate unexpected new data.  Existing tables can be changed in place either by simply adding new data rows into the table or executing SQL alter table commands. No queries or applications that sit on top of the data warehouse need to be reprogrammed to accommodate changes. Old queries and applications continue to run without yielding different results. But in normalized models each modification should be considered carefully, because of the complex dependencies between database tables.

== Dimensional Models, Hadoop, and Big Data ==
{{NPOV section|date=June 2018}}
We still get the benefits of dimensional models on [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]] and similar big data frameworks. However, some features of Hadoop require us to slightly adapt the standard approach to dimensional modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sonra.io/2017/05/15/dimensional-modeling-and-kimball-data-marts-in-the-age-of-big-data-and-hadoop/|title=Dimensional Modeling and Kimball Data Marts in the Age of Big Data and Hadoop|last=Uli|first=Bethke|date=2017-05-15|website=Sonra|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Apache Hadoop#HDFS|Hadoop File System]] is [[Immutable object|immutable]]. We can only add but not update data. As a result we can only append records to dimension tables. [[Slowly changing dimension|Slowly Changing Dimensions]] on Hadoop become the default behavior. In order to get the latest and most up to date record in a dimension table we have three options. First, we can create a [[View (SQL)|View]] that retrieves the latest record using [[Select (SQL)#Window function|windowing functions]]. Second, we can have a compaction service running in the background that recreates the latest state. Third, we can store our dimension tables in mutable storage, e.g. HBase and federate queries across the two types of storage.
* The way data is distributed across HDFS makes it expensive to join data. In a distributed relational database ([[Massively parallel|MPP]]) we can co-locate records with the same primary and foreign keys on the same node in a cluster. This makes it relatively cheap to join very large tables. No data needs to travel across the network to perform the join. This is very different on Hadoop and HDFS. On HDFS tables are split into big chunks and distributed across the nodes on our cluster. We don’t have any control on how individual records and their keys are spread across the cluster. As a result joins on Hadoop for two very large tables are quite expensive as data has to travel across the network. We should avoid joins where possible. For a large fact and dimension table we can de-normalize the dimension table directly into the fact table. For two very large transaction tables we can nest the records of the child table inside the parent table and flatten out the data at run time.

'''Employee of the Month''' is a talk show hosted by [[Catie Lazarus]] that features guests with jobs of interest, ranging from television personalities and musicians to comedians and puppeteers. It began as a live show in 2010 and became a podcast&lt;ref name="itunes.apple"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/employee-of-the-month/id487274151|title=EMPLOYEE of the MONTH|publisher=iTunes|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012. Lazarus has hosted live tapings at [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theater]] in [[New York City]], [[92nd Street Y|92 Y]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.92y.org/index.php/weblog/item/employee_of_the_month_catie_lazarus/|title=Employee of the Month Catie Lazarus|publisher=92 Y Online|accessdate=July 7, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126174623/http://blog.92y.org/index.php/weblog/item/employee_of_the_month_catie_lazarus/|archivedate=January 26, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Los Angeles]] and [[The Bell House (New York)|The Bell House]] in [[Brooklyn]]. It has been syndicated for airing on [[Sirius XM Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.employeeofthemonthshow.com/about/|title=About: EMPLOYEE of the MONTH|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is currently performed and taped live at [[Joe's Pub]] in New York City monthly.&lt;ref name="itunes.apple"/&gt;

Lazarus hatched the idea for the podcast when she was frustrated with her own attempt at finding a job, which led her to approach successful people to talk about their work and how they had landed their dream jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/jobs/search_terms_fVBGy8zvQIh7axOalg611H|title=Job seeker’s futile efforts lead to career ‘talk show’|publisher=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon Stewart]] chose ''Employee of the Month'' to give his first interview after announcing his decision to retire from the [[Daily Show]] in February, 2015.  Stewart follows many of his Daily Show collaborators, including Aasif Mandvi, Dave Attell, Wyatt Cenac, Buck Henry, Mo Rocca, David Wain, and Lewis Black as guests on the show; in turn, Lazarus herself appeared in the Daily Show in a sketch about a prequel to Hot Tub Time Machine. Stewart discussed some of his future plans, assuring fans that he was not retiring. Though he plans to spend more time with his family, he suggested that he would continue writing – to which Lazarus later responded by giving him a notebook as a parting gift - and even that he could return to stand-up comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/jon-stewart-is-ready-for-next-iteration-of-the-daily-show-20150220|title=Jon Stewart Is Ready for 'Next Iteration' of 'Daily Show' - Rolling Stone|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enrique Sarasola Lerchundi''' (24 August 1937 – 2 November 2002) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[business magnate|industrialist]], a major figure in his country's transition to [[democracy]],{{cn|date=October 2015}} and an owner and [[horse breeding|breeder]] of [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorses]].
 
A native of [[Donostia|San Sebastian]], [[Spain]], at age twenty, Sarasola emigrated to [[Colombia]] as an [[audit|auditor]] with [[Price Waterhouse]]. He married Cecilia Marulanda, from a wealthy family, and eventually went into business for himself. Highly successful, in 1970 he returned to his native Spain where he became active in politics. Working behind the scenes where political opposition was suppressed by the government of [[General Franco]], Sarasola used his wealth to help the then illegal [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) headed by [[Felipe Gonzalez]]. After Gonzalez was elected [[Prime Ministers of the Spanish government|Prime Minister of the Spanish government]] in 1982, Enrique Sarasola became a powerful figure during Gonzalez' fourteen years in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.transicionestructural.net/index.php?topic=709.0 La Gran Cloaca (II).

Enrique Sarasola owned a number of successful racehorses, the best known of which was [[Helissio]], winner of the 1996 [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]] and [[Cartier Racing Award|European Horse of the Year]]. From 1992 until its closure in 1996, Sarasola was the owner of Hipodromo de la Zarzuela [[race track]], just west of Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jockeysroom.com/msg20.htm La Zarzuela Racetrack, Spain]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{es}} {{cite web|url=http://actualidad.orange.es/nacional/herederos-sarasola-tendran-que-pagar-34-millones-al-grupo-torras.html|title=Los herederos de Enrique Sarasola Lerchundi tendrán que pagar 34 millones al Grupo Torras noticias Nacional actualidad|accessdate=2 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602183452/http://actualidad.orange.es/nacional/herederos-sarasola-tendran-que-pagar-34-millones-al-grupo-torras.html|archive-date=2 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4685">'''European Works Councils''' (EWC) are information and consultation bodies representing employees in European [[multinational corporation|multinational]] companies.

== Purpose ==
The rationale behind the establishment of European Works Councils is related to the economic and political integration of the [[European Union]]. As companies became more transnational, the local information and consultation bodies (such as [[works council]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) lacked a direct link to the level on which the real decisions are taken. As EWCs bring employee representatives of all over Europe together with the European management, they have an opportunity to be informed and consulted on the transnational companies strategy and status.

== Legal basis ==
European Works Councils are regulated by two European [[Directive (European Union)|directives]]. The first EWC directive was adopted in 1994 ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31994L0045 94/45/EC]) and a revised [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] was adopted in 2009 ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32009L0038 2009/38/EC]). These directives are transposed into national legislation in all [[European Union]] and [[European Economic Area]] countries.

The adoption of the EWC Recast Directive came after a long period of discussion on the desirability of giving these councils extra rights and putting an extra burden on companies. In the end, the EWC Recast Directive adopted in 2009 contained some important changes regarding the definitions of information, consultation and transnational issues, included a right to training for employee representative and provided some more requirements for EWC agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0959680116685948|author=De Spiegelaere, S., &amp; Waddington, J.|title= Has the recast made a difference? An examination of the content of European Works Council agreements | doi=10.1177/0959680116685948 | journal=European Journal of Industrial Relations|page=095968011668594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Companies ==
European Works Councils can be established in multinationals operative in more than two EEA countries if they pass a certain threshold of number of employees. Currently, the company (or the group of companies) needs to employ at least 1000 employees in the EEA and at least 150 employees in two member states. If a company passes these thresholds, an initiative can be taken by the employer or the employees to establish a European Works Council.

After such an initiative, a Special Negotiation Body enters into negotiation on the practicalities of the European Works Council: the composition, the competences, the amount of meeting, the need for translation and interpretation in the meetings and much more. This negotiation results in an EWC agreement which forms the basis for all EWC functioning.

== Current situation ==
Since the first Directive on European Works Councils was adopted, over a 1000 EWCs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ewcdb.eu/stats-and-graphs|title = STATS &amp; GRAPHS|website = ewcdb.eu|access-date = 2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been created. According to estimations, they would cover an estimated amount of 19 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/netuf/2015/12/18/european-works-councils-progress-and-a-long-road-ahead/|title = European Works Councils: progress and a long road ahead|date = 2015-12-18|website = NETUF|language = en-US|access-date = 2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; employees in the EEA. Most EWCs are established in companies from the metal, chemical and services industries. Geographically, most EWCs are established in companies headquartered in Germany, the US, France and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etui.org/Publications2/Books/European-Works-Councils-and-SE-Works-Councils-in-2015.-Facts-and-figures|title=De Spiegelaere, S., &amp; Jagodzinski, R., (2015). European Works Councils and SE Works Councils in 2015. Facts and figures|website=www.etui.org|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the EWC Recast Directive, the implementation of the Directive was to be evaluated no later than 5 June 2016. This evaluation was however postponed to the end of 2016 and further postponed to 2017. In the meantime, several evaluation studies have been published from the [https://www.etuc.org/sites/www.etuc.org/files/publication/files/europeanworks_councils_ces_01.pdf ETUC], the [https://soc.kuleuven.be/ceso/wo/erlm/files/permewc-final-report-eng Leuven University] and the [http://www.etui.org/Publications2/Reports/Too-little-too-late-Evaluating-the-European-Works-Councils-Recast-Directive ETUI].

'''Fibre modification''' is a research field in which researchers aim at developing and applying technologies to impart new properties to natural fibres such as those in [[paper]], in order to increase their functionality. Research areas in this field include many different technologies, amongst which the chemical modifications of fibres are widely used. One important sector of application of the chemical modifications is the treatment of [[wood]] for giving it enhanced properties such as higher mechanical properties, water impermeability, less [[hygroscopic]]ity, bacterial and fungal resistance. Transferring and adapting the technical knowledge on fibre modification available for the wood sector to the recycled paper sector is an innovative use of these chemical treatments which has been the subject of studies that have been carried out within an EU co-funded project called Fibre+.&lt;ref&gt;7th Framework Program – SME-AGs funding scheme – Grant Agreement n° 315633 – http://www.fibreplus.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The project Consortium included members representing Paper and Packaging European Associations ([[Confederation of European Paper Industries|CEPI]], FEFCO), and research institutes specialized in the wood and paper for [[packaging industry|packaging sector]] and paper and packaging companies. The focus of the project was on chemical modification of the paper made recycled fibres, investigating the possibility to transfer wood fibre modifications technique from the wood sector to paper and packaging sector. The aim was to enhance the properties of papers and of the packaging, as the recycling process causes the deterioration of fibres.

The chemical modification of recycled fibres aimed at the creation of a new generation of packaging papers characterized for being more recyclable, less hygroscopic, stiff and durable. The high [[recycling]] rate of papers in Europe (which is at the level of 72%) and the consequent importance that recycling has for the circular economy, were at the basis of this study. Paper products form part of an integrated carbon cycle based on the [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] conversion of water, [[carbon dioxide]], nutrients and solar energy into renewable wood-based [[biomass]]. Once consumed, paper may be recovered and used again either as a source of secondary fibres, to produce recycled paper or as [[bio-fuel]]. Fibre packages or corrugated containers made from [[corrugated board]] were the ones that were dealt with in the project, as they are considered as being the most prominent structural application of paper.

==Chemical modification attempts==

Fibre modification with chemicals or [[enzyme]]s had been investigated in the production of [[fibreboard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Krzysik, A.M., J.A. Youngquist, R.M. Rowell, J.H. Muehl, P. Chow and S.R. Shook|year= 1993|title=Feasibility of using recycled newspapers as a fiber source for dry-process hardboards|journal=For. Prod. J.|volume=43|pages=53–58|url=https://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/6276892}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gomez-Bueso et al. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller et al. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Fibre modification applying steam (steam-exploded wood) has been proved an efficient pre-treatment method in producing [[thermoplastic]] composites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Takatani, M., Itoh, H,. Ohsugi, S,. Kitayama, T., Saegusa, M., Kawai, S. and Okamoto, T.|year=2000|title=Effect of lignocellulosic material on the properties of thermoplastic polymer/wood composites,
|journal=Holzforschung 
|volume=54
|pages=197–200
|doi=10.1515/HF.2000.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Current theories for interfibre bonding during papermaking process are based on general recognition of the [[hydrogen bonding]] model. Consequently, all effort for boosting fibre strength is connected to mechanical beating of fibres in order to generate more flexible and fragmented fibres for increased bonding areas. As a consequence, significant drawbacks are obtained in terms of water retention ratio resulting in poor dewatering behaviour and high energy consumption. New mechanisms for interpretation and control of interfibre bonding are still upcoming. One way to overcome these drawbacks could be the molecular coating of [[cellulose]] fibres using [[polymer]]s targeted on [[entropy]] controlled mixing of polymers and cellulose gel resulting in higher bonding forces. Theoretical results as well as experimental data on how application of polymeric layers (e.g. [[carboxymethyl cellulose]]) and enzymes on cellulose fibres can lead to sheets of high bonding strength without any mechanical beating have been already presented.&lt;ref&gt;Laine at al. 2002, Gustavsson 2003, Danielsson 2006, Erhard 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these attempts were still far from any industrial implementation and their application would have been costly and would not solve the problem of raw material availability.

==Objective==

Based on this state-of-the-art, the objective of the project was to modify and thus improve the characteristics of different types of recovered fibres used for the production of a variety of packaging grade papers used as linerboard and corrugating medium for corrugated board manufacturing in Europe. Information on the actual furnish characteristics and composition of packaging materials is expected to help European packaging industry to evaluate its sources of supply and to adopt suitable methods and processes to improve the available resources in an optimal manner. In the case of packaging, scientific technical knowledge of practical industrial relations between fibre characteristics, paper properties and corrugated board properties also is needed.

From wood fibre modification to paper technology chemical wood modification aims at altering the structure of the cell wall matrix. Wood
properties are improved considerably by converting [[hydrophilic]] OH-groups into larger more [[hydrophobic]] groups. Also the physical fixation of modifying chemicals in the cell wall matrix can considerably change the wood properties. In addition to a hydrophobing effect, the treatments reduce the volume of [[cell wall]] nano-pores and thus decrease the incorporation of water molecules into the cell wall matrix. On a macroscopic scale, wood modification can change important properties of the wood including biological durability (resistance against fungi), dimensional stability, [[hardness]] and [[UV-stability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hill CAS|year=2006|title=Wood modification. Chemical, thermal and other processes|publisher=Wiley, Chichester|isbn=978-0-470-02172-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since paper is produced from wood fibres, it was possible to transfer some of the developments achieved in wood technology to paper technology. Several technologies (e.g. chemical modification, nano-scale celluloses, [[polyelectrolyte]]s, functional polymers based on cellulose, [[hemicellulose]]s and [[starch]]) were researched and used by different research groups around Europe (e.g. PTS and [[University of Goettingen]], Germany; [[Kungliga Tekniska högskolan]] (KTH), Sweden.) There is already well established knowledge on chemical fibre modification of recycled fibres. Adamopoulos and Mai (2011) modified recycled fibres with N-methylol compounds and [[glutaraldehyde]] with significant improvement on fibre characteristics and paper sheet performance.&lt;ref&gt;Adamopoulos and Mai (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory sheets manufactured with a variety of chemically modified recycled fibres were found to be superior in stiffness and hygroscopic properties than these manufactured from unmodified ones.&lt;ref&gt;Adamopoulos et al. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The intention of the Fibre+ project is to build on the existing knowledge on fibre modification for adapting, implementing and disseminating this innovative technology in European paper SMEs.

==Biography==

===2005-2008: Career Beginnings===
Wexler got his start as an A&amp;R intern for [[Sony Music]] where he pitched an unknown artist, Stefani Germonatta, as “the next Madonna.” Germonatta, whose early demos Wexler recorded, went on to become [[Lady Gaga]]. Soon after, Wexler landed his own record deal with [[Virgin Records]] where he enjoyed a brief stint as an artist himself, sharing stages with bands like [[Maroon 5]], [[Good Charlotte]], and [[Simple Plan]]. From there, he wrote and produced full-time for other artists and inked a contract with EMI Music Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popculturemadness.com/interview/2010/Freddy-And-The-Dials.php |title=Celebrity Interviews - Celebrities, Actors, Musicians, Authors, Artists, TV, Film |website=Popculturemadness.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wexler's first commercial success was as a producer on a single for singer [[Marion Raven]] (of Norwegian pop duo M2M) which he coproduced with Nikki Sixx of [[Mötley Crüe]]. He went on to write songs for a host of recording artists and also wrote the promo-theme songs for the hit TV-shows "[[Dancing with the Stars]]" and "[[The Bachelorette]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsle.com/article/0/26009302/ |title=News About Your Network |website=Newsle.com |date=2014-07-14 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008-2009: [[Kidd Kraddick in the Morning]]===
While attending college, Wexler received an ON-AIR phone call from celebrity morning show host [[Kidd Kraddick]] (whose show boasts the largest drive-time audience in America). Kraddick proposed a challenge—to drive from Philadelphia to Texas, playing shows along the way. Wexler accepted and embarked on what stations across the country promoted as the “Freddy Needs Gas Tour.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturefeast.com/kidd-kraddick-launches-the-gas-money-tour |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 30, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119155847/http://www.culturefeast.com/kidd-kraddick-launches-the-gas-money-tour/ |archivedate=January 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received nearly $10,000 of fan donations in just four days, which he donated to Kraddick's charity: Kidd's Kids.
The positive response to Wexler's music lead to his move to Dallas, where he became a cohost on "Kidd Kraddick in the Morning," the then-largest syndicated music morning show in America. Based out of Texas, and stretching across 75 cities across the country, Wexler became a poster-child for independent pop music, performing on major television morning shows and sharing the stage with acts like [[Maroon 5]], [[Good Charlotte]], [[Paramore]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Forever the Sickest Kids]], The New Temptations, [[Gym Class Heroes]], [[Simple Plan]], [[Ryan Cabrera]], and [[Colbie Caillat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popculturemadness.com/interview/2010/Freddy.html |title=Celebrity Interviews - Celebrities, Actors, Musicians, Authors, Artists, TV, Film |website=Popculturemadness.com |date=2008-05-09 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 4, Wexler headlined a show in Frisco TX and sold over 22,000 tickets.

===2009-2010: The Brain House===
In 2010, Wexler returned to Philadelphia and graduated summa cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christina Cook |url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/2014-05-01/latest-news/writers-house-makes-room-state-art-recording-studio |title=Writers House makes room for state-of-the-art recording studio &amp;#124; Penn Current |website=Upenn.edu |date=2014-05-01 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started a music management company, where he represented several recording artists including Rachel Platten &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rachelplatten.com/bio/ |title=Bio |publisher=Rachel Platten |date= |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (singer of the Top 10 hit "Fight Song"), as well as a handful of established models. The following year, Wexler built The Brain House, a modern-day songwriting commune in the Hollywood Hills where he invited a group of writers, musicians, and artists to live and work together under one roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=* |url=http://anthemmagazine.com/this-girls-got-moxie-2/ |title=This Girl's Got Moxie! |publisher=Anthem Magazine |date=2014-07-07 |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012-present: The Brain Music===
In February 2012, Wexler founded The Brain Music, a cross-platform record label, artist management company, and publishing company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrainmusic.com/about/ |title=About - THE BRAIN |website=Thebrainmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10561">'''Fundamental breach''' of [[contract]]&lt;ref&gt;sometimes known as a '''repudiatory breach'''&lt;/ref&gt; is a controversial concept within the [[common law]] of [[Law of contract|contract]].  

Although the concept caused some excitement in the 1950s and 1960s, the concept has been regarded as flawed and wrongheaded{{by who|date=November 2018}} and has been effectively "laid to rest" in [[English Law|England]] and Canada.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Background – the law of deviation==
{{Contract law}}
The origins of the idea of fundamental [[breach of contract|breach]]  may be traced to early cases on the  doctrine of [[Deviation (law)|deviation]]. In ''Davis v. Garrett'' &lt;ref&gt; Case report [http://www.lawandsea.net/List_of_Cases/D/Davis_v_Garrett_1830_6_Bing_716.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Tindal C.J. stated that a carrier's deviation from the agreed voyage route amounted also to a deviation from the terms of the contract, including its exceptions or limitation clauses provided by such a contract. This view was adopted in the leading cases of ''[[Deviation (law)|Glynn v Margetson]]'' &lt;ref&gt;''Glynn v Margetson''[1893] AC 351 [1907] 1 KB 660&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;case report [http://www.lawandsea.net/List_of_Cases/G/Glynn_v_Margetson_1893_AC_351.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Deviation (law)|Leduc v Ward]]''.&lt;ref&gt; ''Leduc v Ward'' (1888) 20 QBD 475&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Case report [http://www.lawandsea.net/List_of_Cases/L/Leduc_v_Ward_1888_20_QBD475.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Glynn v Margetson'' (1893) &lt;ref&gt;[1893] AC 351 [1907] 1 KB 660&lt;/ref&gt;  a vessel carrying Seville oranges from Malaga to Liverpool deviated from the agreed route, by heading first to Burriana (near Valencia). This deviation caused delay and deterioration of the perishable cargo. The carrier relied on a 'liberty clause' in the [[bill of lading]] which purported to allow the vessel 'liberty to visit any port in any order'. In the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], Lord Herschell LC declared the liberty clause to be an [[exemption clause]] in disguise, adding "The main object of this bill of lading is the carriage of oranges from Malaga to Liverpool". He thus established the '''"main purpose rule"''', holding that no exclusion clause would be allowed to cut into the main purpose of any contract. 

Similarly, in ''Leduc v Ward'' (1888) a vessel bound from Fiume&lt;ref&gt; Fiume is modern day Rijeka&lt;/ref&gt; to Dunkirk headed instead towards Glasgow, sinking in a storm in the Clyde estuary. The court held that even though the shipper may have known of the planned deviation, the [[parol evidence rule]] meant that the route described in the bill of lading was conclusive, and that the deviation was actionable, preventing the carrier from invoking the protection of the "[[perils of the sea]]" exemption.

''[[Tate &amp; Lyle v Hain Steamship Company]]''&lt;ref&gt;iLaw[https://i-law.com/ilaw/doc/view.htm?id=142321]&lt;/ref&gt; was a further deviation case following this approach.

==Adoption of fundamental breach within contract law==
Although the 19th century cases were maritime cases, the idea of the "main purpose" caught on in the general [[English contract law|law of contract]] after Lord Greene [[Master of the Rolls|MR]], in ''[[Alderslade v. Hendon Laundry Ltd.]]''(1945) &lt;ref&gt;[1945] KB, 189 at p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;, labelled the fundamental term as ‘the hard core of the contract'. 

In ''[[Karsales (Harrow) Ltd. v. Wallis|Karsales  v Wallis]]'' [1956] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1956/4.html EWCA Civ 4] a buyer inspected a car dealer's used Buick car and agreed to buy it. The car was later delivered at night, and had been towed. When the buyer inspected the car in the morning, it would not work and it was clear it had been involved in an accident, and there were other changes: its tyres had been replaced by old ones, body parts were missing, and the engine's cylinder head was detached, revealing burnt valves. This was a serious breach, but the dealer sought to rely on a clause in the contract: "No condition or warranty that the vehicle is roadworthy or as to its age, condition or fitness for any purpose is given by the owner or implied herein."

Although the clause was clear and well drafted, the [[English Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] declared that a "car" was a "vehicle capable of self-propulsion", and accordingly this Buick was not a proper car. Following ''Glynn v Margetson'' and using its "main purpose" concept, the court held that the dealer was "in breach of a fundamental obligation" and so could not rely on any exclusion clause.

This decision was clearly fair to the buyer, and ''Karsales v Wallis'' soon became the leading case on "fundamental breach". As a matter of law, under the doctrine of fundamental breach of contract, exclusion clauses were deemed not to be available to a party in fundamental breach of the contract. However, all was not well, as business people felt alarmed that an agreed contract term could be set aside by a court; there seemed to be no "certainty".{{fact|date=November 2018}}

Also, there arose some confusion as to what "fundamental breach" actually was. Some alleged it was a breach that went to "the root of the contract", a breach so fundamental it would permit the distressed party to [[anticipatory repudiation|repudiate]] the contract and claim damages. However, since both common law&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bettini v Gye]]'' (1876)&lt;/ref&gt; and statute&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[The Sale of Goods Act 1893]]&lt;/ref&gt; already recognised that while that breach of warranty entitled a claimant only to damages, any breach of condition would entitle a claimant both repudiation and damages, it seemed that fundamental breach offered nothing new.&lt;ref&gt;In other words, fundamental breach was not some kind of "super breach of condition".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resolution – the ''Suisse Atlantique''==
The matter came to a head in 1966 in the House of Lords decision ''[[Suisse Atlantique Societe d'Armement Maritime S.A. v. N.V. Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale|Suisse Atlantique]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1966] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 529&lt;/ref&gt;. The case involved a two-year [[time charter]] to export coal, the shipowners to be paid [[freight rate|freight]] dependant on tonnage of cargo carried. If [[laytime]]{{efn|"Laytime" is the allowable period for the charterer to arrange loading and unloading}} were exceeded, the charterers were to pay [[demurrage]] of $1,000 per day. The charterers caused huge delays and few round trips were made. Demurrage totalled only $150,000, so the owners claimed damages for their full losses, saying they should not be limited to the demurrage terms because the charterer's gross delays amounted to fundamental breach.

The House of Lords boldly held that ''Karsales v Wallis'' had overstated the law, and that whether or not a fundamental breach extinguishes any protection that the defendant might rely on was a "question of construction" and not a "question of law".{{efn|i.e not automatic}} Although the demurrage clause was so absurdly low that it amounted to an exemption clause, nevertheless its existence plainly showed that the parties had contemplated the possibility of delay, so delays would not amount to fundamental breach.

After the ''Suisse Atlantique'' decision, there was a series of cases where the [[Court of Appeal]] patently ignored the House of Lords' findings. One such case was ''[[Harbutt's "Plasticine" Ltd v Wayne Tank and Pump Co Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1970] 1 QB 447&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Lords was less than amused, and in the 1980  ''[[Photo Production Ltd. v. Securicor Transport Ltd|Photo Productions]]'' case they emphatically reaffirmed their decision in the ''Suisse Atlantique''.  [[Lord Wilberforce]] effectively overturned the "rule of law" doctrine of ''Karsales v Wallis'' and instead maintained a strict "[[rule of construction]]" approach whereby a fundamental breach is determined by examining the full circumstances, such as the parties' intentions at the time of the contract.

These two cases (the ''Suisse Atlantique'' and ''Photo Productions'') thus form the definitive statement of the law up to the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]].{{efn|as amended by the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]]}}

More recently, this law was successfully applied in two cases related to carriage of goods by sea and application of limitation clauses under the [[Hague-Visby Rules]]: ''[[Daewoo Heavy Industries Ltd. v. Klipriver Shipping Ltd.]]''&lt;ref&gt;Also, ''The Kapitan Petko Voivoda'' [2003] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 1&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Happy Ranger''&lt;ref&gt;[2002] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Suisse Atlantique'' case has taken the sting out of the fundamental breach idea, in deviation itself little has changed. ''Glynn v Margetson'' still holds, so that not only may deviating carriers be denied the protection of exemption clauses expressly in the contract, they will also be denied the protection of implicit exemptions such as Article IV of the [[Hague-Visby Rules]]. However, given the general move in the [[common law]] away from [[strict liability]] to a standard of "[[reasonable care]]" (or "[[due diligence]]"),&lt;ref&gt;''viz'' ''[[Re Polemis]]'' &amp; ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''viz'' ''[[The Glenfruin]]'' (1885) 10 PD 103 &amp; ''[[McFadden v Blue Star Line]]'' [1905] 1 KB 697&lt;/ref&gt; this may change in due course.

{{notelist}}

==Canada==
The doctrine of fundamental breach has been “laid to rest”&lt;ref&gt;2010 SCC 4, para. 81&lt;/ref&gt; by the Supreme Court of Canada in ''[[Tercon Contractors Ltd. v. British Columbia (Transportation and Highways)]].''&lt;ref&gt;2010 SCC 4&lt;/ref&gt; In its place, the court has created a three-step test to evaluate the application of exclusion clauses. The first step is to evaluate the exclusion clause in the factual context of each case to determine if it applies to the material circumstances. The second step is to evaluate if the exclusion clause was unconscionable at the time of incorporation. The final step is to evaluate whether the exclusion clause should not be enforced on public policy grounds.

Gilbert Facchinetti was born in [[Lausanne, Switzerland]] &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.letemps.ch/sport/gilbert-facchinetti|title=Gilbert Facchinetti|date=16 February 2007|work=Le Temps}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a family from [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.letemps.ch/sport/neuchatel-xamax-change-fief-patriarche|title=Neuchâtel Xamax changes de fief de patriarche|date=16 February 2007|work=Le Temps}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a butcher's apprenticeship, he played at [[Servette FC]] and later received an offer from [[Genoa Cricket and Football Club|Genoa]], with a salary of 6,000 Swiss francs per month. When his uncle died, Facchinetti was pushed by his father to enter the family business, which was an architectural firm. He played one last match in the national league in 1969 with FC Cantonal Neuchâtel.&lt;ref name=":0"  /&gt;
Ten years later, in 1979, he took over the management of Neuchâtel Xamax, a club created by the merger between FC Cantonal Neuchâtel and FC Xamax. A true patriarch, he took his club to two Swiss championship titles in 1987 and 1988. Knowing how to mobilize the economic fabric of Neuchâtel to the point that "when a tunnel was digging in town, it meant, basically, that a new striker was going to sign with the club," he signed players like [[Heinz Hermann]], [[Uli Stielike]], [[Hossam Hassan]], [[Lajos Detári]], or coach [[Gilbert Gress]].&lt;ref name=":1"  /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lematin.ch/sports/football/Je-ne-lcherai-jamais-rien-jirai-jusquau-bout/story/22387652|title=NE Xamax: "Je ne lâcherai jamais rien, j’irai jusqu’au bout"|date=8 January 2012|work=Le Matin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A man of speech, Facchinetti signed his contracts with a handshake until two players ask him for large sums without respecting the handshake.

He left the executive director position of his club in 2003 to Alain Pedretti, having spent twenty-four years as the head.&lt;ref name=":1"  /&gt; He remained nevertheless the honorary president of the club until his death. In 2012, he officially rejoined the club following a bankruptcy.

Facchinetti died on July 6, 2018, in Neuchâtel, shortly after having seen the promotion of his club of heart in Swiss first division.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rts.ch/sport/football/suisse/super-league/9698151-neuchatel-xamax-gilbert-facchinetti-est-decede.html|title=Neuchâtel Xamax: Gilbert Facchinetti est décédé|date=6 July 2018|work=RTS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://epaper.nzz.ch/index.cfm/epaper/1.0/share/email?defId=8&amp;publicationDate=2018-07-08&amp;newspaperName=NZZ%20am%20Sonntag&amp;pageNo=21&amp;articleId=233187637&amp;signature=7dafe83ccf3ea9d17d0d0475a27f448da739b264|title=Gilbert Facchinetti, 82|work=NZZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[common law]] jurisdictions, an '''implied warranty''' is a [[contract law]] term for certain assurances that are presumed to be made in the sale of products or [[real property]], due to the circumstances of the sale. These assurances are characterized as [[warranty|warranties]] irrespective of whether the seller has expressly promised them orally or in writing. They include an implied warranty of '''fitness for a particular purpose''', an implied warranty of '''merchantability''' for products, implied warranty of '''workmanlike quality''' for services, and an implied warranty of '''habitability''' for a home.

The '''warranty of merchantability''' is implied, unless expressly disclaimed by name, or the sale is identified with the phrase "[[as is]]" or "with all faults." To be "merchantable", the goods must reasonably conform to an ordinary buyer's expectations, i.e., they are what they say they are. For example, a fruit that looks and smells good but has hidden defects would violate the implied warranty of merchantability if its quality does not meet the standards for such fruit "as passes ordinarily in the trade". In [[Massachusetts]] [[consumer protection]] law, it is illegal to disclaim this warranty on household goods sold to consumers.

The '''warranty of fitness for a particular purpose''' is implied when a buyer relies upon the seller to select the goods to fit a specific request. For example, this warranty is violated when a buyer asks a mechanic to provide snow tires and receives tires that are unsafe to use in snow. This implied warranty can also be expressly disclaimed by name, thereby shifting the risk of unfitness back to the buyer.

Another implied warranty is the '''warranty of title''', which implies that the seller of goods has the right to sell them (e.g., they are not stolen, or patent infringements, or already sold to someone else). Theoretically, this saves a buyer from having to "pay twice" for a product, if it is confiscated by the rightful owner, but only if the seller can be found and makes restitution.

==Fitness for a particular purpose==
An '''implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose''' is a warranty implied by law that ''if'' a seller knows or has reason to know of a ''particular purpose'' for which some item is being purchased by the buyer, the seller is guaranteeing that the item is fit for that particular purpose.&lt;ref name=Primack&gt;Primack MA.

''Jones Day Publications''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International sales law===
In international sales law, the obligation is found in Article 35(2)(b) of the [[United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods]].

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the obligation is in section 55 of Schedule 2 ("The Australian Consumer Law") of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth).

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the obligation is in Article 2, Section 315 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]]. The warranty of fitness applies to all sellers, unlike warranty of merchantability which applies only to professional merchants.  In the United States, this warranty is sometimes referred to simply as a '''warranty of fitness'''.

==Merchantability==
An '''implied warranty of merchantability''' is a warranty implied by law that goods are reasonably fit for the general purpose for which they are sold.

===International sales law===
In international sales law, merchantability forms part of the ordinary purpose of the goods. According to Article 35(2)(a) of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, a seller must provide goods fit for their ordinary purpose.

===Australia===
In Australia, the obligation is in section 54 of Schedule 2 ("The Australian Consumer Law") of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth). Each State and Territory now applies the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) as the law of the state. This has created a uniform consumer protection law across the entire country.

===United Kingdom===
The [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] states that in a contract for the sale of goods it is an implied condition that the goods supplied are of merchantable quality. The implied condition is excluded if any defects are drawn to the buyer's attention before the contract is concluded or if the buyer examines the goods before the contract is concluded and finds, or ought to have found, a defect.&lt;ref&gt;Sale of Goods Act 1979, sect. 14(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the obligation is in Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC). This warranty will apply to a merchant (that is, a person who makes an occupation of selling things) who regularly deals in the type of merchandise sold.

Under US law, goods are 'merchantable' if they meet the following conditions:
#The goods must conform to the standards of the trade as applicable to the contract for sale.
#They must be fit for the purposes such goods are ordinarily used, even if the buyer ordered them for use otherwise.
#They must be uniform as to quality and quantity, within tolerances of the contract for sale.
#They must be packed and labeled per the contract for sale.
#They must meet the specifications on the package labels, even if not so specified by the contract for sale.

If the merchandise is sold with an express "guarantee", the terms of the implied warranty of merchantability will fill the gaps left by that guarantee. If the terms of the express guarantee are not specified, they will be considered to be the terms of the implied warranty of merchantability. The UCC allows sellers to [[disclaimer|disclaim]] the implied warranty of merchantability, provided the disclaimer is made conspicuously and the disclaimer explicitly uses the term "merchantability" in the disclaimer.&lt;ref&gt;U.C.C. § 2-316(2)&lt;/ref&gt; Some states, however, have implemented the UCC such that this can not be disclaimed.

==Habitability==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}

An implied warranty of habitability, generally, is a warranty implied by law that by leasing or buying a residential property, the lessor or seller is promising that the property is suitable to be lived in. The warranty of habitability can be breached if there is no heat, hot water, or other essential services. Also, safety issues like no smoke alarm or other fire code issues can be considered to make a dwelling uninhabitable. Also, if the municipality in which the property is located prohibits habitation without a certificate of occupancy but has not issued such a certificate with respect to the property, the unlawfulness of that habitation renders the property uninhabitable as a matter of law. The breach of the implied warranty of habitability can be used to legally break a lease. If the factors have been created or are controllable by the landlord and he or she has not fixed them despite ample written notification, this situation can also be considered constructive eviction, which allows the tenant to break the lease, but also may allow the tenant to sue for damages in some jurisdictions.

==Disclaimer of an implied warranty==
In some jurisdictions, an implied warranty in a sales [[contract]] can be expressly disclaimed by the use of specific language, such as the words, "[[as is]]" or "with all faults". The term is used in the [[Antiquarian book trade in the United States|antiquarian]] and [[Used bookstore|second-hand]] book trades to describe a volume in less than ideal condition.

===United States===
In the United States, a disclaimer must be conspicuous in the contract, e.g., in a different kind of print or font that makes it stand out. On the other hand, [[express warranty]], that is, any affirmation of fact or promise to the buyer, or description of the good, oral or written, can be negated or limited only if such disclaimers are not unreasonable. ([[Uniform Commercial Code]], Section 2-316 (1)).

Some jurisdictions, however, limit the ability of sellers or manufacturers to disclaim the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness, such as Massachusetts. ([[Massachusetts General Laws]], Chapter 106: Section 2-316A). Furthermore, the warranty of habitability is generally not able to be disclaimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dutenhaver|first1=Katheryn M.|title=Non-Waiver of the Implied Warranty of Habitability in Residential Leases|journal=Loyola University of Chicago Law Journal|date=1978|volume=10|page=41|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/luclj10&amp;div=10&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=Frona M.|title=Disclaimers of Implied Warranty in the Sale of New Homes|journal=Villanova Law Review|date=1989|volume=34|pages=1132-1153|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/vllalr34&amp;div=53&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contractual language can also limit the remedies available for breach of an implied warranty - for example, capping recoverable damages or limiting the [[legal remedy|remedy]] to a replacement of a defective item. However, such a term can be found to be [[unconscionability|unconscionable]]. For example, if a defective product causes a personal injury, a contractual provision limiting recovery in such a case will be deemed ''[[prima facie]]'' unconscionable. (Uniform Commercial Code, §2-719(3).)

[[PepsiCo]] has produced a number of variations on its primary [[cola]], [[Pepsi]], over the years, including the following:

==Sodas==
{{Repetition|date=August 2008}}
*'''[[Pepsi]]''': [[PepsiCo]]'s signature cola flavor and its namesake cola.
*'''[[Caffeine-Free Pepsi|Pepsi Free]]''': Introduced in 1982 by PepsiCo as the first major-brand caffeine-free cola and is today sold as [[Caffeine-Free Pepsi]] and [[Caffeine-Free Pepsi|Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi]].
*'''[[Pepsi Wild Cherry]]''': Introduced in 1988, it is cherry flavored cola. Known as Wild Cherry Pepsi until 2005. It was named Wild Cherry to not be confused with Coke's Cherry variation. Available nationally in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Russia]].
*'''[[Crystal Pepsi]]''': the Clear version of cola; introduced in 1992 and sold until 1993, it returned in 2015 as part of a limited sweepstakes promotion, and has been re-released several times since.
**'''Crystal from Pepsi''': Discontinued citrus/cola hybrid; reformulation of Crystal Pepsi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adage.com/article/news/pepsi-sees-citrus-appeal-crystal/90890/|title=PEPSI SEES CITRUS APPEAL IN ITS CRYSTAL|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''Pepsi Clear''': Clear Pepsi released in Mexico as a limited edition during Christmas 2005, the Mexican equivalent of Crystal Pepsi.
*'''Pepsi AM''': Contains more [[caffeine]] than a regular Pepsi and marketed as a morning drink. Introduced in 1989 and discontinued in 1990.
*'''Pepsi Fresh''': Made only for summer 2007.{{Specify|date=March 2010}}
*'''Pepsi X''' - 2012 release (Dragon Fruit Cola) Marketed from X Factor television show.
*'''Pepsi Candy''': Sold in [[Canada]] in 1999 in the Spring as a sweeter version with a fruity taste.
*'''[[Pepsi Raw]]''': "a new cola made with only natural ingredients", released in select markets in 2009 and discontinued along with its variant Pepsi Raw in 2011.
*'''[[Pepsi Blue]]''': A blue colored fruity soda (described as a "Berry Cola Fusion"). Given a huge marketing push, often considered a major flop on the order of [[New Coke]]. No longer produced. In Iceland, Pepsi Blue was sold for a brief period of time during the winter of 2003/2004, and in India during the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. It was sold for a longer period in [[Austria]], and is still available in some parts of [[Mexico]]. It is also still available in [[Indonesia]]. It was also sold in the Philippines for a limited time only, usually, it appears during Christmas season. Likewise, it was sold for a limited time in Australia, [[Bulgaria]], [[Poland]], [[Finland]], and [[Romania]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
*'''Pepsi Gold''': Limited edition gold colored variant as part of a [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and [[ICC Cricket World Cup 2007]] promotion. It had a hint of ginger, but nowhere near the spice level of Pepsi Red, and was sold in Southeast Asia, Central Europe, Finland, Russia, [[Turkey]], and The Middle East. Re-released as Pepsi Cheer for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

== Biography and Career ==
He grew up in various orphanages, the longest in a house run by nuns in [[Szamotuły]]. He graduated from a 2-year vocational school in plumbing.

In the 80s he traded at the [[Poznań]] trade fair, at the end of the 1980s he specialized in coffee making and then in computer hardware distribution.

In 1987, he founded [[Elektromis]], an enterprise importing [[confectionery]], radio and television equipment, beer and spirits. Within 2 years, it transformed into a huge holding. Some of his companies back then were registered and ran by his friends from the orphanages. In 1992, [[Elektromis]] owned 50 warehouses throughout [[Poland]] and PLN 168 million of profit per year.

In 1993, he transformed Elektromis into [[Eurocash]], which became the largest grocery wholesale chain in [[Poland]]. In 1995 he sold it to [[Jerónimo Martins]]. In 1995, he founded the discount chain [[Biedronka]], which he sold (243 branches) in 1998 also to [[Jerónimo Martins]].

He was the owner of the weekly ''Miliarder''. He helped [[Jerzy Urban]] in setting up the weekly "''Nie''". He founded the Posnania bank, which, however, in 1995 closed down.

In 1998, he founded [[Żabka (convenience store)|Żabka]], whose shares in 2000 were bought by the AIG fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/12/Artykul/307770,EBRD-to-invest-in-Polandbased-grocery-retailer-Zabka|title=EBRD to invest in Poland-based grocery retailer Żabka|work=Polskie Radio dla Zagranicy|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, he launched the "Sowiniec FIZ" fund investing in real estate. It owns land between [[Puszczykowo]] near [[Poznań]] and [[Sowiniec, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Sowiniec]]. At the end of the 1990s, he also bought plots in Poznań, in the [[Stare Miasto, Poznań|Naramowice]] housing estate.

In December 2010, the Poznań-based company [[Świtalski &amp; Synowie]] changed its name to Czerwona Torebka SA. In 2013, he created the discount chain store Czerwony Torebka. In April 2015, the management of the company Dyskont Czerwona Torebka SA decided to liquidate the company. In July of the same year, all stores were closed, and the company Czerwona Naporeka ceased to exist.

As of 2015, he was the 40th richest person in Poland as named by [[Wprost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rankingi.wprost.pl/100-najbogatszych-polakow/2015|title=100 Najbogatszych Polaków 2015|website=Rankingi Wprost|language=pl|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Master of Science in [[Marketing]]''' (or '''MS Marketing''') is a [[graduate degree]] that prepares the student to work in [[middle-management]]-and-above marketing positions.  The specific field within marketing will depend on the student, their program, and the firm with which they will work.  Fields may include [[brand management]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauschnabel|first=Philipp A.|last2=Krey|first2=Nina|last3=Babin|first3=Barry J.|last4=Ivens|first4=Bjoern S.|date=2016-08-01|title=Brand management in higher education: The University Brand Personality Scale|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296316000369|journal=Journal of Business Research|volume=69|issue=8|pages=3077–3086|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.01.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[digital marketing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wymbs|first=Cliff|year=2011|title=Digital Marketing: The Time for a New "Academic Major" Has Arrived|url=|journal=Journal of Marketing Education|volume=1–14|pages=14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; integrated marketing communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/036381119190020L?via=ihub|title=Integrated marketing communications: A new master's degree concept |language=en|access-date=2017-03-29|doi=10.1016/0363-8111(91)90020-L|volume=17|journal=Public Relations Review|pages=237–244 | last1 = Caywood | first1 = Clarke}}&lt;/ref&gt; marketing [[analytics]] and [[research]], [[marketing strategy]], [[pricing strategy]] and many others.
 
The key difference between the MS Marketing degree and the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) degree is the required number of marketing courses in the degree.  Typically the MBA degree may have a concentration in marketing or other fields of 4-6 courses.  The MS Marketing degree will usually have 10-12 marketing courses.  The MBA will offer courses in [[accounting]], [[finance]], [[business]] strategy, marketing, organizational behavior and other general business courses in much less depth than a specialized degree&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laud|first=Robert L.|last2=Johnson|first2=Matthew S.|date=2013-03-01|title=Progress and Regress in the MBA Curriculum: The Career and Practice Skills Gap|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15416518.2013.781398|journal=Organization Management Journal|volume=10|issue=1|pages=24–35|doi=10.1080/15416518.2013.781398}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the MS Marketing degree that requires marketing courses, supplemented with perhaps a few [[electives]] in other areas such as analytics.

The '''McGill Executive Institute''' is the corporate education and management development unit of the [[McGill University]] [[Desautels Faculty of Management]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. It provides a variety of public business seminars as well as custom [[executive education]] and coaching for all levels of management.

Founded in 1956,&lt;ref name="computers"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QokxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=naUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=mcgill%20executive-development&amp;pg=1308%2C2644596 McGill Management Institute teaches the unusual...it’s where executives go to learn about computers], The Montreal Gazette, Aug 18, 1984, Retrieved on August 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the Institute has a full-time staff of learning design and program managers working with professors at McGill’s Faculties of Management, Law, Arts, Education and Medicine, external guest experts in specific fields, as well as visiting professors from universities worldwide. The Institute’s clientele includes businesses, not-for-profit organizations and government/public sector services.

==History==

Concurrent to business seminars offered by McGill, the Executive Development Institute, a private business education organization, began to offer the Executive Development Course (EDC) in 1949, in affiliation with the [[Montreal Board of Trade]]. It was developed with support from the Graduate School of Business at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vJgtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kZ0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=executive-development-institute%20board-of-trade&amp;pg=3255%2C552133 Executive Development Institute, 12th Annual EDC], The Montreal Gazette - Sep 5, 1961, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aMItAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=d54FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=montreal%20board-of-trade%20seminar%20institute%20executive&amp;pg=4026%2C1105140 Executive Development Institute, 13th Annual EDC], The Montreal Gazette - Sep 7, 1962, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W8MtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_Z4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=executive-development-institute%20board-of-trade&amp;pg=1953%2C316811 Executive Development Institute, 15th Annual EDC], The Montreal Gazette - Aug 3, 1964, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A precursor to the existence of many MBA and later EMBA programs, the EDC was designed to provide a comprehensive look at management practices in strategy, human resources, marketing, negotiations and financial acumen.&lt;ref name="computers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kZMtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j54FAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=executive-development-institute%20board-of-trade&amp;pg=3272%2C1782776 To Help the Executive Grow], The Montreal Gazette - Jul 11, 1963, Retrieved on August 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1984, the McGill Management Institute was offering 70 day-time seminars and 20 evening courses each year, in addition to the EDC.&lt;ref name="computers" /&gt;

In 1993, the McGill Management Institute was renamed the McGill International Executive Institute. It took its current name, the McGill Executive Institute, in 2002. It is a division of the [[Desautels Faculty of Management]].

==Philosophy==

The McGill Executive Institute has been noted for its approach to action-based learning,&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf Executive Education in Canadian Firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210412/https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, Bruce Gordon R. Fowler, University of Calgary, 2009, pg 213, Retrieved on September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for its international dimension. In his 2009 work, ''Executive Education in Canadian Firms'', Bruce Gordon R. Fowler states the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The executive programs at this Institute recognize better than most schools, even among the other eight illustrious institutions discussed here, the need for international diversity and content. Indeed, McGill has been recognized as having an international dimension unsurpassed in North America for diversity among students and faculty, and for program style and content. The scope of McGill's global outlook is certainly equal to that of Harvard and INSEAD, also featured here as giants of international connectivity, which simply must be part of any program involving  executives of international or multinational firms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf Executive Education in Canadian Firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210412/https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, Bruce Gordon R. Fowler, University of Calgary, 2009, pg 138, Retrieved on September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Products and Services==
Each year, the McGill Executive Institute provides approximately 20 to 40 open enrolment seminars addressing a number of business topics. The Institute’s longest running program is the Executive Development Course which was launched in 1949. The EDC has been expanded over the years, and is currently offered in three successive modules: the Executive Development Course, the Advanced Management Course, and Integrated Management Thinking. Together, these are referred to by the Institute as the [[Mini-MBA]] Series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://executive.mcgill.ca/seminars List of Seminars available from McGill Executive Institute website], Retrieved on September 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The McGill Executive Institute also designs and delivers customized learning solutions specifically for an organization’s team of managers or executives.  Services range from short workshops delivered in English, French or bilingual formats to global initiatives with delivery of modules to participants across management levels over several years.

The McGill Executive Institute also offers an International Masters in Practicing Management (IMPM), as well as the Advanced Leadership Program (ALP). These longer, global programs occur over several modules and across multiple international locations, in conjunction with other universities: The Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore, India; Lancaster University in the UK; Korea Development Institute School of Public Policy and Management in Seoul, Korea; and INSEAD in France. Both the ALP and the IMPM were co-founded and are co-directed by Professor [[Henry Mintzberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf Executive Education in Canadian Firms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706210412/https://dspace1.acs.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/47681/1/Fowler_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-06 }}, Bruce Gordon R.

The IISMI was the first integrated steel mill to be built in Southeast Asia.In 1962, NASSCO was completely sold to the Jacinto family. The Macapagal government guaranteed the Eximbank loan of $62.3 million, plus a peso loan of P30 million (Henares, 2006). On September 21, 1972, martial law was declared, and on October 14, Marcos directed to take over IISMI (LOI 27). This time Marcos extended the assistance he denied the Jacintos: tariff protection (PD 34, dated October 29). Unfortunately, even though the corporate name included “Integrated”, IISMI was nowhere backward integration.

The '''National Steel Corporation''' or '''NSC''' (1951 – 2004) was a Filipino [[steel]]-making company, the largest in the Philippines. It had headquarters in, [[Iligan City]], in the Philippines. The company was founded as '''National Shipyards &amp; Steel Corporation''' in 1951. It was sold in 1962 to Jacinto &amp; Son, a private Filipino company, and was later renamed '''Iligan Integrated Steel Mills'''.

'''Norwegian Competition Authority''' ({{lang-no|Konkurransetilsynet}}) is [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[etat|Government agency]] responsible for managing the ''Competition Act'' of 2004, including [[regulation]]s imposed through the [[European Economic Community]]. This includes regulating [[cooperation]] that hinders [[competition]], misuse of a dominant market position and control of [[buy-out]]s and [[merger]]s. The authority is based in [[Bergen]].

==History==
Competition regulation in Norway dates back to the break-out of [[World War I]] when merchants made large profits maximizing the price of necessary goods. To counter this, the authorities regulated the price and availability of food through [[ration]]s. On July 21, 1917 the '''Norwegian Price Directorate''' was created to regulate the Norwegian market. The present name came in 1994 when a new ''Competition Act'' was passed and the authority restructured.

In 2003, the agency was moved from Oslo to [[Bergen]], along with six other directorates and inspectorates which were moveed out of Oslo, in a program initialized by [[Victor Norman]], [[Minister of Government Administration and Reform (Norway)|Minister of Government Administration and Reform]] of the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]]. It cost 729 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK) to move the seven agencies. An official report from 2009 concluded that the agencies had lost 75 to 90% of their employees, mostly those with long seniority, and that for a while critical functions for society were dysfunctional. No costs reductions had been made, there was no significant impact on the target area, and there was little impact on the communication between the agencies and the ministries. In a 2010 report, Professor Jarle Trondal concluded that none of the agencies had become more independent after the move, despite this being one of the main arguments from the minister. Norman successor, [[Heidi Grande Røys]] of the [[Socialist Left Party (Norway)|Socialist Left Party]], stated that the moving had had an important symbolic effect on the target areas, and that she did not see the lack of advantages as a reason to not move similar agencies later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/politikkSamfunn/article1689821.ece |title=Svekket av flytting |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=17 June 2009 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 January 2011 |archivedate=12 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vgc62Ypn?url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/politikkSamfunn/article1689821.ece |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/politikkSamfunn/article2058623.ece |title=Flytting av tilsyn ut av Oslo ga null effekt |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=12 January 2011 |language=Norwegian |accessdate=12 January 2011 |archivedate=12 January 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vgcD6t6S?url=http://www.dn.no/forsiden/politikkSamfunn/article2058623.ece |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
On 2 November 1924, [[Harold Frederick Pitcairn|Harold Pitcairn]] founded the [[Eastern Airlines|Pitcairn Flying School and Passenger Service]].

Rebranded [[Eastern Air Lines]] in 1926, it flourished for decades after the 1950s until acquired by [[Frank Lorenzo|Franz Lorenzo]] in 1985 amidst indebtment and labour dispute in the new [[Airline Deregulation Act]] market. Management decisions (e.g. asset transfer to [[Continental Airlines]]) combined with further labour unrest against [[International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers|IAM]], [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] and [[Air Line Pilots Association, International|ALPA]] during the [[List of strikes|1989 Easter Airline strike]] led to the company liquidation in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Grounded: Frank Lorenzo and the Destruction of Eastern Air Lines.|last=Bernstein|first=Aaron|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1990|isbn=9780671695385|location=New York|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Thomas L. Cooper, one of its former [[Boeing 727]] captain who flew during the [[List of strikes|1989 strike]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://file.wikileaks.org/file/airline-pilot-scab-list-2004.pdf|title=This is the US master pilot scablist - The unionist's edition|last=|first=|date=5 June 2004|website=WikiLeaks.org|publisher=WikiLeaks|page=14|access-date=18 July 2016|quote="Cooper, Thomas L, EAL 89, 17392, 10/62, Owner Gulfstream Airlines"}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched a small charter company named [[Gulfstream International Airlines]] (GIA) offering flights around South Florida, the Bahamas and Cuba in [[Cessna 402]]s. Early on, Captain candidates paid $15,000 up front starting in 1992 with intermediary business Avtar International doing the recruiting and advertising, selling multi-engine time in [[Cessna 402]]s with the assurance from the Miami Flight Standard District Office that this time was loggable. At the time, captains received compensation only following successful completion of Initial Operating Experience (IOE), First Officers would continue to fly without pay for between 150–200 hours.  They were often able to continue flying without purchasing additional hours if replacements didn't come in quickly enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cockpitseeker.com/2014/p1-faa-pilots-p2f/|title=USA: P2F origins (part 1)|last=|first=|date=7 October 2014|website=CockpitSeeker|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aforementioned regulation reduced the scope of 'pay-to-fly' among FAA licensees by raising minimum standards.&lt;ref name=bloom /&gt; Indeed, to serve as SIC (Second In Command or First Officer) :

"A pilot may be eligible if he or she was a military-trained pilot; a graduate of a four-year bachelor degree program with an aviation major; a graduate of a two-year associate degree program with 
an aviation major; or has 1,500 hours total time as a pilot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Table 5.

===Switzerland===
According to [[Federal Office of Civil Aviation|FOCA]] vice director Marcel Zuckschwerdt:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marcel Zuckschwerdt nouveau sous-directeur à l'OFAC|url=http://www.bazl.admin.ch/aktuell/medieninformation/00024/index.html?lang=fr&amp;msg-id=2217|website=www.bazl.admin.ch/index.html?lang=en|publisher=OFAC/FOCA|language=French|date=November 30, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"There is no regulation that would prohibit from doing this [pay-to-fly], it is absolutely possible. One can wonder of course, is it safe? Is it acceptable in terms of safety?
And when we examined the matter, we reached the conclusion that, in the end, it's the pilot motivation that is the argument to say it is satisfying in terms of safety" &lt;ref name="rts" /&gt; (at 9':50")

===France===
'Pay-to-fly' is illegal per social regulation as a work contract can be established on demand by a judge as long as:
# there's a proven subordination relationship between the service provider and the party benefiting from said service;
# the moral or physical person benefiting from the service enforces a framework to which the service provider abides.
Legal action can be taken in case of violation, and sanctions can amount from 45,000 to 220,000 euros in fines and 3 years of prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contrat de travail|url=http://contrat-de-travail.comprendrechoisir.com/comprendre/requalification-contrat-de-travail|website=contrat-de-travail.comprendrechoisir.com/|publisher=ComprendreChoisir|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the French [[Directorate General for Civil Aviation (France)|DGAC]], "pay-to-fly is not used among carriers operated under the French flag" &lt;ref name="france-info" /&gt; which doesn't prevent French pilots from suffering from it.&lt;ref name="france-info" /&gt;&lt;ref name=france-2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=slate /&gt;

In 2013, 1,739 French pilots were registed in [[Pôle emploi]], a 43% rise as per the three preceding years.&lt;ref name=france-info /&gt;
In December 2014, graduate student pilots from the [[École nationale de l'aviation civile|ENAC]] (French Civil Aviation University) alone, reported under the AGEPAC association that, from 2006 to 2011 concerning a sample of 319 pilots:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STATISTIQUES DES ELEVES PILOTES DE LIGNE PROMOTIONS 2006 - 2011|url=http://www.agepac.org/fichiers/files/AGEPAC_Suivi-EPL_Dec2014.pdf|website=www.agepac.org/|publisher=AGEPAC (Association Générale des Elèves Pilotes de l’Aviation Civile)|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
The [[Civil Aviation Authority of Norway|Civil Aviation Authority]], responsible for aviation safety in Norway, is not concerned.

According to Frode Lenning, head of Fleet Operation Section, [[Civil Aviation Authority of Norway|CAA]]: “Pilots have been trained within commercial companies for years. However, it is new that some companies ask money to train pilots within their own company [...] We have been training cadet pilots in the cockpit for years, at different levels. What is new here, is the social aspect, and this is not part of the aviation safety regulatory system” &lt;ref name=nrk /&gt;".

However, during the pilots' strike of [[Norwegian Air Shuttle|Norwegian]] in March 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norwegian Pilots End Strike After Deal Reached With Airline|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/norwegian-pilots-end-strike-deal-reached-airline-29534937|publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures|date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'pay-to-fly' airline [[Small Planet Airlines]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Small Planet Airline p2f setup with Pilot Management Services (Cyprus)|url=http://www.cockpitseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/goodies/p2f/small-planet-airline/|website=www.smallplanet.aero/|publisher=Small Planet Airlines}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed 50 [[Norwegian Air Shuttle|NAS]] slots under [[wet lease]],&lt;ref name=nrk /&gt; establishing a workforce that pay to work while at the same time breaking their colleagues' strike.

===Netherlands===
[[File:Persfoto Wilma Mansveld 03.jpg|thumb|right|''"Given the fact that EASA tackles this issue appropriately and also given the fact that the Dutch aviation sector to the extent known is currently not using these contracts on a large scale, from a safety point of view there is as yet no reason to intervene at a national level."''&lt;ref name=dutch-a/&gt; _[[Wilma Mansveld]]]] Since 2008 the job market for pilots has deteriorated rapidly. Most pilots that have been trained at a Dutch flight school have to look for a job abroad. According to VNV-DALPA the job market for ab initio pilots is poor. "Some companies outside the Netherlands do hire pilots, but these are so-called pay to fly-schemes.

* Some airlines require the pilot to pay for a [[type rating]] in full before commencing training, usually at a cost – about £18,000 to £35,000.&lt;ref name=balpa-ng-booklet /&gt;
* It is possible to complete the [[type rating]] and line training without having employment. Some agencies and FTOs will charge you to put you through your [[type rating]] and place you with an airline to operate as a First Officer until completion of your line training. You would receive no salary during hours-building, so arguably you are paying the airline to work for them.&lt;ref name=balpa-ng-booklet /&gt;
* The cost of this varies depending upon the company, and often does not usually come with any guaranteed job offer at the end of the line training or hours-building.&lt;ref name=balpa-ng-booklet /&gt;
* The risk to consider here is that you are rating yourself on one particular aircraft, and therefore in the event that you do not continue with that airline, it makes you more attractive only to other airlines operating that type, and can be a waste of money if you land a job with the operator of a different type. This airline may then require you to fund another type rating which might be beyond you financially once you’ve funded the first rating.&lt;ref name=balpa-ng-booklet /&gt;
"[[BALPA]] does not recommend funding type ratings unless absolutely necessary".&lt;ref name=balpa-ng-booklet /&gt;

On April 10, 2014, Senator [[Éric Bocquet]] released an Information Report on behalf of the European Affairs Commission on social dumping in European transport.&lt;ref name="senat2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/rap/r13-450/r13-4501.pdf|title=RAPPORT D´INFORMATION FAIT au nom de la commission des affaires européennes sur le dumping social dans les transports européens|last=|first=|date=April 10, 2014|editor-link=Éric Bocquet|website=Senat.fr|publisher=Sénat (french Senate)|pages=41|language=French|access-date=|quote="La compagnie luxembourgeoise Strategic avait, quant à elle, mis en place un système dit de pay to fly, les jeunes pilotes devant payer pour voler et ainsi acquérir des heures de vol."|last1=BOCQUET|first1=Éric|issue=450}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aviation sector specifically (chapter II), subpart B (frauds), Senator Bocquet acknowledged "[[Strategic Airlines Luxembourg]] had, for all intents and purposes, set up a system of pay-to-fly, young pilots having to pay in order to fly and thus acquire flight hours".&lt;ref name="senat2" /&gt;

=== Ghent University study ===
Co-financed by the [[European Commission]] and carried out across 11 countries by the [[Ghent University]] on behalf of the European [http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=480&amp;langId=en&amp;intPageId=1829 Sectoral Social Dialogue Committee for Civil Aviation] (notably the [[Association of European Airlines|AEA]], the [[European Cockpit Association|ECA]] and the [[Fédération européenne des travailleurs des transports|ETF]]), the study on "Atypical Employment in Aviation" was presented during the High-Level Atypical Employment conference in Paris on 12 and 13 February 2015.&lt;ref name="atypicalEMPL" /&gt;

Accounting for policy options, the study concluded:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A mandatory internship for newly licensed cadets should be considered. Pilots fresh from school are in an extremely weak labour market position often only finding jobs at deplorable conditions or even having to resort to pay-to-fly schemes in order to clock up the flight experience required by airlines offering better conditions. [...] It is our strong opinion that pay-to-fly schemes should be prohibited, not only in the European Union, but globally".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/6852830/file/6853379.pdf|title=Atypical Employment in Aviation - Final Report|last=|first=|date=February 2015|website=Universiteit Gent|publisher=UGent|page=296|access-date=11 July 2016|quote="A mandatory internship for newly licensed cadets should be considered.

=== French National Assembly report ===
On June 28, 2016, deputy member of the Assemblée Nationale [[Gilles Savary]] presented an Information Report&lt;ref name="assembnat"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Gilles SAVARY|title=RAPPORT D’INFORMATION DÉPOSÉ  PAR LA COMMISSION DES AFFAIRES EUROPÉENNES  sur la stratégie européenne pour l’aviation présentée par la Commission européenne le 7 décembre 2015 (COM(2015) 613 final)|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/pdf/europe/rap-info/i3887.pdf|website=assemblee-nationale.fr|publisher=Commission des affaires européennes|accessdate=13 February 2017|page=66|language=French|date=28 June 2016|quote=...la législation sociale dans le secteur aérien n’est pas seulement mal appliquée, elle est aussi insuffisante, les formes de travail atypiques (contrats zéro heures, système « pay-to-fly », faux indépendants et sociétés boîtes aux lettres) ne relevant pas d’une interprétation divergente des règles mais bien des lacunes de ces dernières.}}&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of the commission for European Affairs and focused on the european strategy for aviation issued by the [[European Commission]] on December 7, 2015.
Paragraph II.C.1. asserts that Senator [[Éric Bocquet|Bocquet]]'s [[Pay to fly#French Senate report|report]] "published little more than two years ago established an enlighting overview on social dumping associated with applicable right in the air transport, which remains fully relevant to this day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Gilles SAVARY|title=RAPPORT D’INFORMATION DÉPOSÉ  PAR LA COMMISSION DES AFFAIRES EUROPÉENNES  sur la stratégie européenne pour l’aviation présentée par la Commission européenne le 7 décembre 2015 (COM(2015) 613 final)|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/pdf/europe/rap-info/i3887.pdf|website=assemblee-nationale.fr|publisher=Commission des affaires européennes|accessdate=13 February 2017|page=65|language=French|date=28 June 2016|quote=.Le rapport d’information de M.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Representative stakeholder organizations heard by the rapporteur brought an important nuance [...]: labour law in the [aviation] sector is not only poorly applied but also insufficient. Atypical employment forms (zero hours contracts, «pay-to-fly» scheme, fake self-employment and mailbox companies) aren't to blame on diverging rule interpretation but truly on their loopholes".&lt;ref name="assembnat" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== MyTravel Airways ===
On 5 July 2007, a [[First Officer (civil aviation)|First Officer]] who was not an employee but was paying [[MyTravel Airways|MyTravel]] to gain flight experience on their aircraft (pay-to-fly), landed an Airbus A320 heavily at Kos airport in Greece causing substantial damage to the main landing gear.&lt;ref name="AAIB-mytravel" /&gt; The report was critical of both the pilots training record and non-employees paying airlines to gain experience.

In February the same year, MyTravel Group plc agreed on a merger with [[Thomas Cook AG]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/a5c4380a-ba34-11db-89c8-0000779e2340|title=MyTravel agrees merger with Thomas Cook|last=Spikes|first=Sarah|last2=Blitz|first2=Roger|date=February 12, 2007|website=ft.com/|publisher=Financial Times|access-date=December 16, 2016|quote=MyTravel, the £1.1bn UK holiday company, and Thomas Cook, its privately-owned Germany-based rival, on Monday agreed a merger of equals that would create a global powerhouse of tour operators.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that became effective in June.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thomascookairlinesuk-newsroom.condor.com/en/int/about-us/history/|title=Thomas Cook Airlines' history|last=|first=|date=|website=thomascookairlinesuk|publisher=Thomas Cook Airlines UK|access-date=December 16, 2016|quote=Following the merger between Thomas Cook AG and MyTravel Group plc in June 2007, the new Thomas Cook Airlines (amalgamating Thomas Cook Airlines UK Ltd and MyTravel Airways) is launched at Gatwick on 30th March 2008.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the accident occurred under the common umbrella of [[Thomas Cook Group|Thomas Cook Group plc]] (as listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]]), with [[MyTravel Airways]] and Thomas Cook Airlines UK Ltd fusing into [[Thomas Cook Airlines]] on 30 March 2008.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Pros===
Defending the 'pay-to-fly' model, a Cockpit4u spokeswoman stated: "It opens up career starters opportunities that are currently not offered on the European market. Abroad such training programs have been common for years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Deckstein Dinah|title=Prekariat am Himmel (Precarity in the sky)|journal=Der Spiegel|date=March 30, 2013|volume=14|page=61|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-91768500.html|language=German|quote=Es eröffne Berufseinsteigern "Chancen, die sich im europäischen Markt derzeit nicht bieten". Derartige Trainingsprogramme seien im Ausland schon seit Jahren üblich.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baltic Aviation Academy]]'s view: When employed regularly, one "will most likely sign an agreement which indicates some sort of liabilities [...] and concessions for the company" that will "commit [oneself] to fly for a few years with that airline" with a "salary deduction from your monthly payment" in order to reimburse the airline's investment on the pilot whereas, one can "choose paid Line Training" to gain "independence" and avoid being "absolutely in [an airline's] service", to "gain the 'luxury' of choosing the airline which you would love to work for and ability to focus on the job which will bring you everyday pleasure" &lt;ref name=baa-st&gt;{{cite web|title=Line Training: to pay or not to pay?|url=http://www.balticaa.com/line-training-to-pay-or-not-to-pay/|website=www.balticaa.com/|publisher=Baltic Aviation Academy|date=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Independence" comes at 19,500 euros the [[type rating]], to which a line training opportunity can be added that "can vary from 46,000 to 55,000 euros" &lt;ref name=baa-tr-lt-1 /&gt;

[[Avia Solutions Group|AviationCV]] reckons: "Line training price depends on the type of aircraft [...] line training A320 might cost around 40 000 – 50 000€ [...]. Usually cadets are asked to pay around 60% of payment before the program and rest of it after. It is important to mention that when obtaining for line training, pilots are not being paid."&lt;ref name=aviationcv-go-p2f&gt;{{cite web|author1=AviationCV.com|title=Line training for pilot: everything you need to know|url=http://www.aviationcv.com/aviation-blog/2015/line-training-for-pilot-everything-you-need-to-know|website=www.aviationcv.com/|publisher=AviationCV|accessdate=23 July 2015|archiveurl=http://www.cockpitseeker.com/wp-content/uploads/posts/AviationCV_Line-training-for-pilot_everything-you-need-to-know.pdf|archivedate=July 14, 2015|date=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding:
"Despite the opinion that line training destroys the airline pilot industry (“Pay to fly”), line training is in itself necessary [...]. For sure, there was a time when airline pilot training was sponsored by the airline hiring a pilot. However, the situation has changed and only few airlines still apply this policy [...]. In order to start your pilot’s career, you need to invest."&lt;ref name=aviationcv-go-p2f /&gt;
{{col-break}}

===Cons===
Since the beginning of the [[Great Recession|recession]] “pay to fly” contracts have been introduced by some carriers. These contracts are designed to provide flexibility to the carrier and usually involve all the training costs being met by the applicant.&lt;ref name=balpa-ng-booklet /&gt; Unfortunately at present, due to the economic situation and the surplus of pilots, this appears to be becoming an increasing trend and arguably results in individuals having limited loyalty and moving on to another airline which offers better careers, contracts/benefits/pay and long-term permanent employment at the earliest opportunity. In order to remain competitive many other carriers are seeing this as an attractive option resulting in potentially this type of contract being more common in the future. According to [[BALPA]], "this is shortsighted and will ultimately deter some potentially good pilots from entering the industry",&lt;ref name=balpa-ng-booklet /&gt; adding the Association is "concerned by the implications long-term".&lt;ref name=balpa-ng-booklet /&gt;

The spreading of the practice is also linked to the rise of pilot generations "slowly strangled by their debt"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Groenendijk-Feenstra|first1=Nienke|url=https://werklozevliegers.wordpress.com/2015/02/19/interview-met-airobserver/|publisher=AirObserver|date=October 18, 2013|title=Pilots are slowly strangled by their debt}}&lt;/ref&gt; where, pilot unions warn, "only the wealthiest, rather than the best, candidates will become pilots, because growing numbers of airlines are having their cadets pay to fly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Even the pilots pay on some low-cost flights|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/even-the-pilots-pay-on-some-lowcost-flights-9028635.html|website=www.independent.co.uk|publisher=The Independent|date=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Cockpit Association|ECA]] considers pay-to-fly as being "flexible contractual set-ups that are often at the edge of what is legal and what is necessary to guarantee flight safety".&lt;ref name=eca&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair Competition in aviation is a must!|url=https://www.eurocockpit.be/pages/fair-competition-in-aviation-is-a-must|website=www.eurocockpit.be/|publisher=European Cockpit Association|quote=[...] making use of fake work bases in non-European countries, and ‘pay-to-fly’ (P2F) programs (whereby newly graduated pilots have to pay their airline for gaining flying experience on an aircraft)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"These set-ups force employees into temporary contract relationships, fake self-employment (e.g. requiring air crew to set up their own limited liability company that offers its services though agencies to the airline), and/or making use of fake work bases in non-European countries, and ‘pay to fly’ (P2F) programs (whereby newly graduated pilots have to pay their airline for gaining flying experience on an aircraft)" &lt;ref name=eca /&gt;

Aside from a French senator report of information in the name of European commission affairs on [[social dumping]] in transports&lt;ref name=senat /&gt; and a European petition supported by the [[European Cockpit Association|ECA]], as far as 'pay-to-fly' is concerned, no regulation and no legislation have been proposed so far.

'''Process optimization''' is the discipline of adjusting a process so as to optimize some specified set of parameters without violating some constraint.  The most common goals are minimizing cost and maximizing throughput and/or efficiency.  This is one of the major [[quantitative property|quantitative]] tools in industrial [[decision theory|decision making]].

When [[optimization|optimizing]] a process, the goal is to maximize one or more of the process specifications, while keeping all others within their constraints. This can be done by using a [[process mining]] tool, discovering the critical activities and bottlenecks, and acting only on them.

Fundamentally, there are three parameters that can be adjusted to affect optimal performance.  They are:
* Equipment optimization
The first step is to verify that the existing equipment is being used to its fullest advantage by examining operating data to identify equipment bottlenecks.

* Operating procedures
Operating procedures may vary widely from person-to-person or from shift-to-shift.  Automation of the plant can help significantly.  But automation will be of no help if the operators take control and run the plant in manual.

* Control optimization
In a typical processing plant, such as a [[chemical plant]] or [[oil refinery]], there are hundreds or even thousands of control loops.  Each control loop is responsible for controlling one part of the process, such as maintaining a temperature, level, or flow.

If the [[control loop]] is not properly designed and tuned, the process runs below its optimum.  The process will be more expensive to operate, and equipment will wear out prematurely.  For each control loop to run optimally, identification of sensor, valve, and tuning problems is important.  It has been well documented that over 35% of control loops typically have problems.{{Fact|date=June 2008}}

The process of continuously monitoring and optimizing the entire plant is sometimes called performance supervision.

{{Portal|Organized labour}}
A '''side letter''' or '''side agreement''' is a [[collective bargaining]] agreement that is not part of the underlying or primary [[collective bargaining agreement]] (CBA) which the parties to the [[contract]] use to reach agreement on issues the CBA does not cover, to clarify issues in the CBA, or to modify the CBA (permanently or temporarily).  One may distinguish side letters from "side settlements" or "settlement agreements", which settle a dispute arising from the underlying CBA.&lt;ref name="CooperTire"&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/6th/054641p.pdf ''United Steelworkers of America v. Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Company],'' [[case citation|474 F.3d 271]] (6th Cir. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In rare cases, bargaining parties may use a side letter to adjust the focus of the contract if the parties are not yet ready or willing to adapt the contract formally.&lt;ref&gt;Kaboolian, Linda, and Sutherland, Paul. ''Win-Win Labor-Management Collaboration in Education: Breakthrough Practices to Benefit Students, Teachers, and Administrators.'' Bethesda, Maryland: Education Week Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-9674795-4-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the law of contracts, a side letter has the same force as the underlying contract.&lt;ref name="CooperTire" /&gt; However, the courts may invalidate side letters in conflict with the main collective bargaining agreement.&lt;ref&gt;"Eighth Circuit Invalidates Side Letter Agreement Conflicting With Collective Bargaining Agreement". ''Benefits &amp; Compensation Legal &amp; Legislative Reporter.'' October 2004; ''Trustees of the Graphic Communication International Union, Local 1B Health and Welfare Fund "A" v. Tension Envelope Corporation,'' [[case citation|374 F.3d 633]] (8th Cir. 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The terms of the CBA govern interpretation of side letters.  In the United States, several [[United States courts of appeals|appellate courts]] have held that in disputes where side letters do not contain [[conflict resolution]] procedures, the parties must use the underlying collective bargaining agreement's dispute resolution mechanism (in these cases, [[arbitration]]) to resolve the dispute.&lt;ref name="CooperTire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca7.uscourts.gov/tmp/FH0OGU6E.pdf ''United Steelworkers v. Trimas Corporation]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},'' No. 07-1688 (7th Cir. July 3, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dube"&gt;Dube, Lawrence E. "Court Orders Arbitration on Neutrality Pact, But Says NLRB May Have to Decide Legality". ''Daily Labor Report.'' September 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of issues side letters covers is wide. In some cases, side letters have driven national [[labour law]] policy. For example, in the United States, a side letter guaranteeing employer neutrality during union elections in newly acquired plants, subsidiaries, or divisions led to a federal lawsuit over the legality of the agreement in 2002 and a major decision by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] revising federal labour policy in 2007.&lt;ref name="Dube" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Int'l Union v. Dana Corp.,'' [[case citation|278 F.3d 548]] (6th Cir. 2002); Gross, Jared S. "Recent Developments: International Union v. Dana Corp." ''Ohio State Journal on Dispute Resolution.'' 2003; Moody, Kim. [http://www.labornotes.org/node/1485 "'Card Check' Takes a Hit"]. ''Labor Notes.'' January 2008; Barker, Joseph A. "Keeping Neutrality Agreements Neutral". ''Michigan Bar Journal.'' August 2005; McGolrick, Susan J. "Attorneys for Dana Corp., Unions Criticize NLRB Decision on Voluntary Recognition". ''Human Resources Report.'' March 3, 2008; "NLRB 3-2 Modifies Recognition Bar". ''U.S. Law Week.'' October 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], side letters are becoming increasingly common due to the changes in federal labour law the [[WorkChoices]] Act created. WorkChoices limits the collective bargaining agreements that parties can register for eligibility for workplace tribunals enforcement, and also requires CBAs be strictly limited to work-related issues. The inclusion of even minor non-workplace-related clauses (such as dues check-off) can render a CBA unenforceable. In response, many unions and employers are using side letters to reach agreement on non-workplace-related matters, and not registering these side-letters with the federal government—relying on [[common law]] to enforce the side letters.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Andrew and Riley, Joellen.

The history of the '''[[Tejo Power Station]]''', operating from 1908 to 1975 in the [[Belém (Lisbon)|Belém district]] of [[Lisbon]], Portugal. 

==Introduction==
As the latter 19th century advanced, Lisbon's rate of urbanisation and electricity consumption was outgrowing existing power generation stations. The two power stations that supplied the city with electricity were the ''Avenida Power Station'' (1889) and the ''Boavista Power Station'' (1903). Their names were intimately connected to their locations. It was for this same reason that during the Tejo Power Station's initial stages, toponymy remained in use and it was originally named the ''Junqueira Power Station'', being located in the Junqueira district. Despite everything, this name didn’t last long since, once construction was concluded, official documents and the plant's facade took on the name of the [[Tagus River|Tagus River (Rio Tejo)]] it was built on, as the [[Tejo Power Station]].

== The original Tejo Power Station ==
The small power plants that existed in the capital (Avenida and Boavista Power Stations) became obsolete due to the increasing demand for [[electric power]]. Furthermore, they were located in heavily urbanised neighbourhoods, thereby exerting a strong environmental impact on the residents and presenting a lack of space for the more than predictable expansions that the new electricity industry was going to require.
For these reasons, at the beginning of 1908, the company that held the concession to produce and distribute electric power in Lisbon, the ''Companhias Reunidas de Gás e Electricidade'' ([[CRGE]] - United Gas and Electric Companies) undertook construction of a new [[Thermal power station|thermoelectric power station]] in Lisbon. In the operating license, they asked for permission to install a “new power generating station”, located in a manufacturing district that went from the Navy Dockyard to Pedrouços beach, in the western part of the city.

The chosen location was situated halfway between the [[Belém Palace]] and the [[Junqueira National Rope Factory]], which still exist today. Thus, after raising the capital to finance the new thermoelectric power station, in March 1908 construction began on the plant that would provide Lisbon and the surrounding area with electricity for more than six decades.

The final technical project was created by engineer [[Lucien Neu]], who made the most of all the usable space by placing the turbines in the central area and the boilers on either side. This project underwent several alterations, with the construction work extending for longer than had initially been programmed. The company responsible for constructing the buildings was [[Vieillard &amp; Touzet]], who maintained approximately 50 workers on the site.
In the summer of 1909, the Tejo Power Station was officially inaugurated despite undergoing important alterations in its interior until 1910, such as the acquisition of new [[Alternator|turbo-alternators]] or the expansion of the boiler room, which involved building a new 36 meter-high chimney in the shape of an inverted pyramidal stem.

From its construction up to 1912, the Junqueira Power Station acquired new machinery to increase its production. In 1908 it started off with two alternators from the Boavista Power Station, each with a 1 MW output, and six Delaunay – Belleville boilers. The 1910 expansion involved the installation of three new [[Brown Boveri &amp; Cª.]] turbo-alternators that raised the total output to 7.75 MW, as well as four boilers at a first stage, later joined by five more boilers with greater vaporisation capacity.
Thus, in 1912, when all this equipment was in place, the original Tejo Power Station had fifteen small Belleville boilers and five generating sets that supplied the city of Lisbon's electric grid.

Regarding the exterior, the building that accommodated this extensive set of machinery displayed an architectural style typical of the small power stations at the end of the 19th century, the then called “electricity factories”. Its plan was of a longitudinal nave covered on two sides, and three transversally adjacent pavilions on the western side. Between them, two slim chimneys doubled the height of the plant's body and “overlooked” the area. The North-South facades displayed the inscription ''1909 / Cªs Reunidas Gás e Electricidade / Estação Eléctrica Central Tejo'' (United Gas and Electric Companies / Tejo Electric Power Station).

This original Tejo Power Station was planned to operate for six years (1908–1914) until the CRGE managed the necessary means to build a larger plant with greater capacity. However, due to the outbreak of [[World War I]] in that final year, the Tejo Power Station's original phase was extended and remained operational until 1921. The production and distribution of electricity began to take place under very precarious conditions since, among other aspects, the fuels used were of poor quality, and as a consequence the boilers suffered constant breakdowns, which led to a significant reduction in the rate of expansion and development of electricity in the city.

Despite these setbacks, construction work on the low pressure boiler building continued, and at the end of 1916 the plant started receiving steam from the first two low pressure boilers installed in the new building that was still under construction but nonetheless guaranteed the necessary conditions to reinforce the supply to the existing generating sets.

In 1921, once the Low Pressure building was constructed and made fully operational, the original Tejo Power Station was deactivated and dismantled, with a set of workshops and warehouses taking its place. Some years later, in 1938, the need to build a new High Pressure boiler building led to the demolition of the naves from the station's original phase, leaving no trace behind.

== The current Tejo Power Station ==
The need to build a new power station to satisfy the growing demand for electricity, and the precarious conditions under which the original Tejo Power Station was operating, led in 1914 to the construction of new buildings and the installation of more efficient machinery. This was a time of growth and modernisation that only ended with the installation of the 15th and final boiler in 1951.

Generally speaking, there were two main construction periods:
* The first, from 1914 to 1930, involved the Low Pressure facility and consisted of building and expanding the low pressure boiler room and the machinery room.
* The second took place between 1938 and 1951, and involved setting up High Pressure production. From the end of this period to this day, the architectural ensemble has remained unaltered, with the high pressure boiler building standing out from the rest of the complex.

=== Low Pressure ===
With the construction of the low pressure boiler building and the new machinery room, the Tejo Power Station began to consolidate itself both in terms of production and on an architectural level, with the use of [[brick]] on the visible facades of the entire industrial complex.

Once again, it is possible to separate this low pressure period into three construction phases:
* The first, from 1914 to 1921, included beginning construction of the boiler building, the coal distributor and the machinery room.
* The second phase lasted from 1924 to 1928. It stands out from the first expansion due to the construction of a manufacturing body to house the new boilers and another coal distributor, identical to the existing ones, a new generating set and the docks to the cooling system and its respective channels.
* Finally, the third phase, which took place between 1928 and 1930, involved expansion of the machinery room and the final expansion of the boiler room, due to the purchase of furnaces that were larger than the previous ones.

==== The First Phase (1914-1921) ====
Construction on the low pressure and machinery buildings began in 1914. The project included several manufacturing bodies: two longitudinal naves covered on both sides, each one to accommodate six [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] low pressure [[boiler]]s; one machinery room with a capacity for two German [[AEG]] 8MW [[Alternator|turbo-alternators]]; as well as a smaller control and substation building. Construction began from north to south and east to west, and aside from the above, the possibility of later expanding on the southern side to the edge of the [[Tagus]] river was also immediately plotted.

Shortly after beginning the construction work, [[World War I]] broke out, causing delays in established deadlines and problems receiving the two turbo-alternators ordered from [[Germany]], which remained detained until the end of the conflict. Nonetheless, in 1916 the first two low pressure boilers were installed (which in the project were assigned numbers 5 and 6) in order to supply the generators from the original power station.

During the two years that followed, two new boilers were installed (numbers 3 and 4) which, along with 5 and 6, exceeded the output that the old generators from the original Tejo Power Station could withstand. The CRGE concluded that it was necessary that another turbo-alternator be purchased to add to the two generators ordered years before from the German supplier and which were still held up, thus moving forward with the construction of one part of the machinery room to accommodate this new generator. In 1919, the new Swiss [[Escher Wyss &amp; Cie]] 7500&amp;nbsp;kW turbo-alternator began operating.

The next year, the remaining boilers (numbers 1 and 2) were installed, and with the war over, the two German AEG sets were finally received, beginning operation in 1921. With the permanent installation of these 6 boilers and three generating sets, production stabilised and it was possible to dismantle the outdated equipment from the Junqueira Power Station.

==== Second Phase (1924-1928) ====
Gradually, due to the increase in consumption, it was once again necessary to carry out new and important work on the power station in order to expand and complete the low pressure boiler room. The program created by the CRGE consisted in expanding one industrial nave that would accommodate three new low pressure boilers and purchasing one new generating set.

Thus, throughout 1922 a study was conducted regarding the installation of boilers number 7 and 9, and the possibility of these operating with pulverised [[coal]], which ended up proving unsuccessful, since in boiler number 6 the tests carried out to implement this process produced unsatisfactory results. Nonetheless, pulverised coal would still be used in boiler number 11.

The “new boiler room”, as it was called, grew southward, toward the [[Tagus]] River, with the facade facing the river and remaining unfinished, temporarily closed off with a sheet of [[zinc]] and a metallic structure imitating the bay windows on the opposite side. This because a third and final expansion was anticipated for this low pressure boiler room. Boilers 7 and 9, both [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]], were the first to be installed in this new space in 1924 and 1925 respectively. The third, boiler 11 – a Humboldt – was installed in 1928; since it used pulverised coal, it had its own coal mill.

The machinery room didn’t undergo any change in size but inside,  an 8MW generating set – number 4, a [[Stal-Asea]] – was installed in 1925. The channels and two [[siphon]]s on the cooling system's new [[Dock (maritime)|docks]] were also built, which carried water from the river to the power station's interior.

==== Third Phase (1928-1930) ====

It was in the third building phase of the Tejo Power Station's first period that construction on the industrial naves was completed, both on the boiler rooms and machinery room. In 1928, the same year boiler 11 was installed, it was decided to go ahead with the purchase of the final two low pressure boilers, numbers 8 and 10, from the most frequent supplier, Babcock &amp; Wilcox, due to the delays on the installation of the Humboldt boiler. However, their permanent installation was only concluded at the end of 1930.

The new manufacturing body that accommodated them maintained the same aesthetic lines as the previous structures, although with greater dimensions. For this, the temporary [[zinc]] sheet facade was removed and the building was built toward the river, acquiring the facade that remains today.

Regarding the machinery room, it was also necessary to pull down the existing southern facade in order to expand the plant's area toward the river, thus aligning it with the boiler room in order to allow the installation of the new and final Escher Wyss/Thompson [[Electrical generator|generating set]] (which, following the sequence used until then, was assigned the number 5), as well as creating a space on the lower floor for unloading and managing [[turbine]]s, alternators and other material. The reinforcement of the machinery's capacity also implied the expansion of the cooling water channelling facility, leading to the construction of two new [[siphon]]s, one for water intake and another for elimination, thereby bringing the total to four siphons.

After approximately fifteen years undergoing construction and expansion, in its Low Pressure phase, the Tejo Power Station finally had three large manufacturing areas: [[boiler]]s, machinery and [[Electrical substation|substation]], located parallel to the river. The boiler room consisted of four large industrial naves that created a free space in the interior for housing eleven low pressure boilers, ten [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] (British technology) and one Humboldt (German origin). The machinery room is a longitudinal and also open space, perpendicular to the boiler room, accommodating five generating sets of varying capacities and brands: [[Escher Wyss &amp; Cie]], [[AEG]], [[Stal-Asea]] and Escher Wyss/Thompson.

=== High Pressure ===
Despite having concentrated work on low pressure during the period between 1930 and 1938, a series of construction work was carried out in order to prepare the Tejo Power Station for future high pressure production, which implied constructing a new building.

The location chosen for this new building was plotted where the original Tejo Power Station still stood. Despite being made up of a combination of workshops and warehouses, before demolishing it, a new location had to be found to accommodate these roles that were complementary but indispensable to the plant's operation. Thus the decision was made to purchase the property and buildings where the old sugar refinery [[Senna Sugar Estates, Ltd.]] (owned by the "Companhia de Açúcar de Moçambique" - Mozambique Sugar Company¬) used to lie, located on the power station's east side.

From the beginning of that decade, [[AEG]] [[Alternator|turbo-alternators]] 2 and 3 began to cause problems and break down constantly, and in 1934 a request was issued to purchase and license the installation of two generators of the same brand but with double the capacity. It was the end of 1935 when the new turbo-alternator number 2 was installed and inaugurated; it was also at this time that installation of the new voltage transformation equipment was concluded, allowing the Tejo Power Station's [[Electrical substation|substation]] to supply the [[Lisbon]] and [[Lisbon District|Tejo Valley region]] all the way to [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]]. At the end of the following year, [[Electrical generator|generator]] number 3 was also replaced.

The installation of new generating sets with greater capacity made it almost mandatory to set up the first high pressure [[boiler]]s (numbers 12, 13 and 14) in order to use the capacity provided by the turbo-alternator sets more efficiently due to the greater power the steam from the new boilers produced. The boilers were once again ordered from manufacturer [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]], and their large size dictated the construction of the largest building in the industrial complex, the High Pressure Boiler Building.

In 1938, dismantled and without use, demolition began on what remained of the old original power plant to build in its place the new Tejo Power Station manufacturing space. Building was contracted out to several companies: for the coal mixer and increase in coal elevation, the [[Societé des Pieux Franki]] was selected, beginning work in September of that year. The metallic structure and construction work was given to Portuguese company [[Vulcano &amp; Colares]], beginning work on the first elements for the structure and the boilers in March 1939.
What was noteworthy about this new building was that its structure was entirely built in [[iron]], with the finishing following the same lines as the low pressure building, in other words, [[brick]] on the visible facades. The difference lay in the [[Ornament (architecture)|trimming]], which contrary to the rest of the complex, presented a markedly classicist character of renaissance palace influence.

During the time in which the High Pressure building began to take shape, work was also taking place on a new building of much smaller proportions destined for the Low Pressure Auxiliary equipment; in other words, to accommodate the water purification and treatment machinery. This annex also served to free up space in the boiler room since an Auxiliary High Pressure room was to be built at a later date. The auxiliary low pressure facility was completed in 1939 and adjoined the main building, next to boilers 8 and 10.

Once again the war, this time [[World War II]], caused delays in the assembly and installation of the high pressure building. The three boilers planned to begin operating in 1940 only began to work a year later when their facilities were finally in working condition; boiler 12 in March, boiler 13 the following month and boiler 14 in August 1941.

However, the boilers couldn’t reach a high output because they were operating under low pressure; the High Pressure auxiliary equipment had to be built and the turbines adapted. The auxiliary building grew within the low pressure boiler room, making it necessary to dismantle boilers 1 and 2 in 1943. On the other hand, making the turbines in sets 2 and 3 compatible with a  high pressure process was complicated, since the order placed with the German manufacturer encountered the commercial blockade that spread all over the [[Europe|European continent]] as a consequence of World War II.
The equipment finally arrived in 1942, allowing High Pressure [[electric power production]] to begin the following year. In 1943, boilers 12 and 13 began to supply [[Alternator|turbo-alternator]] number 2, and in 1944, boiler 14 began supplying turbo-alternator 3.

Because of the war, during the years of conflict the price of [[coal]] increased progressively while its quality dropped. Consequently, the rise in prices quadrupled in only six years (between 1939 and 1945). On the other hand, electricity production also rose progressively, reaching maximum rates year after year, peaking in 1950 at a record rate of 52 200&amp;nbsp;kW and 216 million kWh produced.

In 1948, due to the escalating price of coal, the three high pressure boilers were slightly altered to adapt them to burn [[naphtha]] (fuel oil), a petroleum by-product that at the time was cheaper than coal. It was also necessary to build an 8 000m3 reservoir near the ''Praça de Carvão'' (Coal Square) to store this flammable liquid.

==== Boiler 15 ====
Throughout the year of 1944, the [[CRGE]] made plans to replace the old alternators and boilers with equipment better suited to the reality of those times, a consequence of technological evolution. Later, and due to the increase in electricity consumption, that project evolved into an expansion plan to create a new production centre, in other words, a new thermoelectric power station. That same year the National Electrification Law was approved, indicating a turning point in Portuguese electric power policy, making [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric systems]] an absolute priority for power production. This meant that a project for a new [[Thermal power station|thermoelectric power station]] would be denied, since it opposed the law. After making several appeals to the government, in 1948 the CRGE were finally granted permission to proceed with a minimal expansion of the Tejo Power Station, which meant the acquisition and installation of a new [[boiler]], boiler number 15.

Once again supplied by [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]], it was installed beside boiler 12. In order to accomplish this, the existing facade had to be demolished, the new area cemented, and the metallic structure covered in brick built, always with the same technique and look. Construction work began at the beginning of 1950 and the boiler began operating when construction was concluded in mid-1951, a time when the power station was already acting as a reserve.

The almost ten-year difference between the installation of the first high pressure boilers and this final one results in differences between them. For instance, boiler 15 already came equipped with naphtha injectors (in the others, these were added progressively), the conveyor belt is lower, the control table is more advanced in registering and reading the boiler's operational data, the boiler dust (ash) pan has six coal hoppers to expel boiler dust and coal (in the other there were only three), and it is also slightly larger in size.

=== Integration into the National Electric Grid ===
The '''National Electrification Law''' made producing hydroelectric power an absolute priority, as was standardising electricity in the country through a national transport network. For those reasons, since 1950 the Tejo Power Station was classified as a reserve power station, occupying a secondary position to support the electric power production sector, inevitably beginning its decline.

Indeed, on 21 January 1951 the [[Castelo do Bode Power Station]] was officially inaugurated, the first of several large scale hydroelectric power plants that the National Electrification Law established in its project to supply [[electric power]] to the large consumption centres, such as [[Lisbon]] and [[Porto]]. From that moment on, the Tejo Power Station became a reserve plant, limiting its operation to years of drought or complicated water situations, and as a support system for the national electric grid. However, it continued to produce power, although operating only one turbo set and two high pressure boilers.

From 1951 to 1968, it worked every year except in 1961. 1953 was an especially difficult year due to a lack of water supply, which meant the Tejo Power Station had to work for almost the entire year, often overburdened in order to satisfy demand not only from its own distribution network but also to support the national grid. It was also during the 1960s that all the low pressure equipment was shut down and dismantled.

The last record of the power station's operation dates 14 August 1972, and is related to the movement opposing the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|political regime]] in government at the time. On 9 August, the high voltage lines that supplied Lisbon with electricity were sabotaged and the city was left without power. The Tejo Power Station was called upon for one week to overcome the problem and produce electricity to supply Lisbon's distribution network. The power station's former workers that had been summoned, some already retired, with all their knowledge and experience, got the Tejo Power Station working once again, feeding coal into boiler number 15 for the last time. 1 200 678 kWh were produced, a residual value that only represented one fifth of the daily consumption demands on the CRGE grid. That is the record that marks the final day of the Tejo Power Station. The noise and vibrations that characterised the operation of this power plant for several generations, were permanently stilled.

Officially, the Tejo Power Station was shut down and declassified in 1975.

== The Electricity Museum ==
{{see also|Electricity Museum (Lisbon)}}
After nationalising the Portuguese electricity sector in 1975, the CRGE's assets were integrated into the new company established in 1976, [[Energias de Portugal|EDP – Electricidade de Portugal]], and the question arose regarding what to do with the old Tejo Power Station, where there was still a large amount of machinery tied to the impressive structure. The proposal was clear: reopen the space as a [[science]] and [[industrial archaeology]] museum.

In the same year the site was declared an '''Asset of Public Interest''', in 1986, the future Electricity Museum's founding team got to work, opening its doors to the general public for the first time in 1990.
The Museum's permanent exhibits tell the story of the Tejo Power Station's process, history and work, as well as relevant aspects in the evolution of [[electric power production]], from the first discoveries to current new forms of producing electricity. The Museum also has a Documentation Centre, a specialised library and a research and conservation service pertaining to a great variety of electricity-related equipment, thus consolidating the historic study of electricity in [[Portugal]] and perpetuating its memories and facts.

Between 2001 and 2005, as a response to its declining state of [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]], the power station underwent restoration work. Its facades and interiors were cleaned, its iron structure reinforced, thousands of bricks were replaced and the [[Museology|museographic]] content was altered, as is visible today and can be confirmed by visiting the space, the old Tejo Power Station, now an Electricity Museum.

'''United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS)''' is a student organization founded in 1998 with chapters at over 250 colleges and universities in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. In April 2000, USAS founded the [[Worker Rights Consortium]] (WRC), an independent monitoring organization that investigates labor conditions in factories that produce collegiate apparel all over the world. The WRC exacts an annual membership fee from participating universities, which is used to fund its monitoring work.

The WRC works with [[NGO]]s, [[human rights]] groups, and local labor unions or federations, in countries where collegiate apparel is produced. At present over 180 universities and colleges have affiliated with the WRC. USAS is also proposing that universities sign on to the [[Designated Suppliers Program]], or DSP, which would act to source collegiate apparel from factories that respect workers' rights to form unions and be paid living wages.

In 2000, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and other major clothing corporations renamed the Apparel Industry Partnership (AIP) the [[Fair Labor Association]] (FLA), in large part to compete with the WRC. The AIP, an initiative of the Clinton Administration, had become a discredited organization, because all non-profit organizations and unions that had initially supported it, withdrew from it, with the exception of the International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF), who subsequently withdrew their institutional membership on the FLA Board soon afterwards.

United Students Against Sweatshops is widely viewed as the largest [[anti-sweatshop]] community group in the United States and Canada. It was formed in 1997 as part of a broader [[anti-sweatshop movement]] increasingly popular in [[North America]].  This movement exhibited a great degree of skepticism of [[free trade]] practices, such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) or the proposed [[Free Trade Agreement of the Americas]] (FTAA).

Focusing on domestic as well as international [[sweatshops]], the group has built coalitions of students, labor groups, workers, and community members that focus on a range of campaigns:

*requesting that [[Russell Brands]] Athletic Brand significantly alter its labor policies in Central America&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.lib.washington.edu/findingaids/view?docId=BrandResponsiblityProject5683.xml Brand Responsibility Project Records] 2004-2012.0.84 cubic feet (2 boxes) of textual materials plus 83.8 GB of digital files.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*supporting an anti-sweatshop policy called the [[Designated Suppliers Program]], which would source collegiate apparel from factories that respect workers' rights to form unions and be paid living wages
*supporting the [[Coalition of Immokalee Workers]]' campaign against [[Taco Bell]] to win higher wages for farm laborers ("Boot the Bell")
*protesting sweatshop working conditions at [[New Balance]] in New York and [[Forever 21]] in San Francisco
*[[living wage]] campaigns for campus workers
*organizing student labor solidarity groups in high schools
*protesting [[Coca-Cola]]'s repression of [[Trade unions in Colombia|union organizers in Colombia]]
*supporting [[trade union|labor]] campaigns in local communities
*increased [[minimum wage]] campaigns in several states and localities
*protesting against [[Jessica Matthews]], board member of [[Hanes]] and president of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], in relation to sweatshop conditions for Hanes workers in the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref name="georgetown_JMatthews"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mahoney |first=Jack |authorlink= |title=TOS Workers' Protest Hanes Boardmember Jessica Matthews |work= |publisher=Georgetown Solidarity Committee |date=2008-03-13 |url=http://www.georgetownsolidarity.org/node/109 |format= |doi= |accessdate=2008-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820000221/http://georgetownsolidarity.org/node/109 |archivedate=August 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

I cannot say I gained something for my business thanks to politics or that I had any political advantages thanks to business”.&lt;ref name=StPTimes/&gt;

==Biography==
Khoroshkovsky completed a postgraduate economics study at Taras Shevchenko [[National Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv|Kyiv State University]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=StPTimes/&gt;

===Business career===
In 1994 Khoroshkovsky started a [[Gurzhos Vadym|metal trading business in partnership with Vadym Gurzhos]] which he disbanded in 1995 to become active in banking.&lt;ref name=StPTimes/&gt; Since then Khoroshkovsky has been active in the furniture retail and trading business and has had stakes in dairy, soda, machinery and bus factories. In 2004 Khoroshkovsky sold his stake in [[Ukrsotsbank]] to Ukraine's second-richest businessman [[Viktor Pinchuk]] for an estimated [[US dollar|$]]200 million.&lt;ref name=StPTimes/&gt;

After Khoroshkovsky's resignation as Economics Minister in January 2004 he was appointed vice president of steel giant [[Evraz]], becoming its head in April 2006 either because of his connections or his 13-year friendship with [[Alexander Abramov]].&lt;ref name=StPTimes/&gt; In December 2006 Khoroshkovsky resigned as Chief Executive Officer of Evraz because of his appointment as the First Deputy Secretary of the [[National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2005 Khoroshkovsky paid about $250 million for a 61% stake in [[Inter TV]], one of Ukraine's biggest television channels.&lt;ref name=StPTimes/&gt; In June 2007 he expanded his [[U.A.

In June 2010 both [[Kanal 5 (Ukraine)|Kanal 5]] and [[TVI (channel)|TVi]] accused Khoroshkovsky of abusing his power and influence to preserve monopoly control of Ukraine's media airwaves and limit objective news reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4821c038-730d-11df-9161-00144feabdc0.html|title=Ukraine channels cry foul as frequencies pulled|newspaper=[[The Financial Times]]|date=June 8, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khoroshkovsky replied (early June 2010) that he was ready to sell his media business to a willing buyer.&lt;ref name=sell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/70071/|title=Khoroshkovsky has his say on conflicts|newspaper=[[Kyiv Post]]|date=June 17, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2010|author=Peter Byrne|agency=[[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency|UNIAN]]|deadurl=no|archivedate=May 22, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522231510/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/70071/|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SBU opened its [[Ukrainian SSR|Soviet Ukrainian]] archives in January 2009. Khoroshkovsky believes that the SBU should reduce public access to its archives and concentrate on its main task of being a secret service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Kyiv Post]]|agency=Interfax-Ukraine|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/opinion/op_ed/detail/62062/|title=Opening KGB-era archives was major step forward for nation|author=Volodymyr Vyatrovych|date=March 19, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204225746/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/opinion/op_ed/detail/62062/|archivedate=February 4, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Member of the European Parliament]] [[Elmar Brok]] (who met Khoroshkovsky when Khoroshkovsky hosted a luxurious dinner for MEPs in [[Brussels]] in November 2010) "he doesn't seem to understand that threatening the independence of the judiciary is one of biggest mistakes you can make when you are trying to build a new state, he doesn't seem to understand what are the proper limits of his mandate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://euobserver.com/9/31232|title=Ukrainian spy-master invites MEPs to dinner|work=[[EUObserver.com]]|date=November 9, 2010|accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Yanukovych conferred a rank of [[general]] to Khoroshkovsky in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/111699/|title=SBU Chief Khoroshkovsky awarded rank of general (updated)|newspaper=[[Kyiv Post]]|agency=Interfax-Ukraine|date=August 26, 2011|accessdate=August 27, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920213537/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/111699/|archivedate=September 20, 2011|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
