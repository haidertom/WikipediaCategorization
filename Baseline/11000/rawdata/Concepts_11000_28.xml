An '''abstention doctrine''' is any of several doctrines that a United States court may (or in some cases must) apply to refuse to hear a case if hearing the case would potentially intrude upon the powers of another court. Such doctrines are usually invoked where [[lawsuit]]s involving the same issues are brought in two different court systems at the same time (such as federal and state courts).

The United States has a federal court system with limitations on the cases that it can hear, while each state has its own individual court system. In some instances, the jurisdiction of these courts overlap, so a lawsuit between two parties may be brought in either or both courts. The latter circumstance can lead to confusion, waste resources, as well as cause the appearance that one court is disrespecting the other. Both federal and state courts have developed rules determining when one court will defer to another's jurisdiction over a particular case.

==Federal abstention doctrines==
The various abstention doctrines applied by federal courts are named for the [[United States Supreme Court]] cases in which they were enunciated.

===''Pullman'' abstention===
''Pullman'' abstention was the first "doctrine of abstention" to be announced by the Court, and is named for ''[[Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co.]]'', 312 U.S. 496 (1941). Concisely, the doctrine holds that "the federal courts should not adjudicate the constitutionality of state enactments fairly open to interpretation until the state courts have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to pass on them."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1986/1986_85_1513/argument/&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine permits a federal court to stay a plaintiff's claim that a state law violates the [[United States Constitution]] until the state's judiciary has had an opportunity to apply the law to the plaintiff's particular case. The hope is to avoid a federal constitutional ruling by allowing the state courts to construe the law in a way that eliminates the constitutional problem or to rule it void under the state's own constitution.

For ''Pullman'' abstention to be invoked, three conditions must be apparent:
#  The case presents both state grounds and federal constitutional grounds for relief;
#  The proper resolution of the state ground for the decision is unclear; and
#  The disposition of the state ground could obviate adjudication of the federal constitutional ground.

Under ''Pullman'' abstention, the federal court retains [[jurisdiction]] to hear the constitutional issues in the case if the state court's resolution is still constitutionally suspect. In ''[[Government and Civil Employees Organizing Committee, CIO v. Windsor]]'', 353 U.S. 364 (1957), the Supreme Court held that litigants must ''inform'' the state court that they are contending that the state law violates a federal constitutional provision, so that the state court may take that into consideration when interpreting the state statute. However, in ''[[England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners]]'', 375 U.S. 411 (1964), the Supreme Court noted that the litigants must not ask the state court to ''resolve'' the constitutional issue itself, or the federal court would be bound by ''[[res judicata]]'' to follow the decision of the state court. In such a case, the litigant seeking a judgment that the law is unconstitutional must usually appeal to the higher courts of the state, rather than seeking review in a federal court.

===''Younger'' abstention===
''Younger'' abstention, named for ''[[Younger v. Harris]]'', 401 U.S. 37 (1971), is less permissive to the federal courts, barring them from hearing [[civil rights]] [[tort]] claims brought by a person who is currently being prosecuted for a matter arising from that claim in state court. For example, if an individual who was charged with drug possession under a state law believes that the search was illegal, and in violation of their [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights, that person may have a [[cause of action]] to sue the state for illegally searching him. However, a federal court will not hear the case until the person is convicted of the crime. The doctrine has been extended to state civil proceedings in aid of and closely related to state criminal statutes,&lt;ref&gt;''Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd.'', 420 U.S. 592, 43 L.Ed.2d 482, 95 S.Ct. 1200 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; administrative proceedings initiated by a state agency,&lt;ref&gt;''Ohio Civil Rights Comm'n v. Dayton Christian Sch., Inc.'', 477 U.S. 619, 627 n.2, 91 L. Ed. 2d 512, 106 S. Ct. 2718 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; or situations where the State has jailed a person for [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref&gt;Judice v. Vail, 430 U.S. 327 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine applies even where the state does not bring an action until after the person has filed a lawsuit in federal court, provided that the federal court has not yet undergone proceedings of substance on the merits of the federal suit.&lt;ref&gt;''Hicks v. Miranda'', 422 U.S. 332, 45 L.Ed.2d 223, 95 S.Ct. 2281 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three exceptions to ''Younger'' abstention:
# Where the prosecution is in bad faith (i.e. the state knows the person to be innocent); or
# Where the prosecution is part of some pattern of harassment against an individual; or
# Where the law being enforced is utterly and irredeemably unconstitutional (e.g., if the state were to pass a law making it a crime to say anything negative about its governor under any circumstances).

===''Burford'' abstention and ''Thibodaux'' abstention===
''Burford'' abstention, derived from ''[[Burford v. Sun Oil Co.]]'', 319 U.S. 315 (1943), allows a federal court sitting in [[diversity jurisdiction]] to abstain where the state courts likely have greater expertise in a particularly complex area of state law (the case itself dealt with the regulation of oil drilling operations in Texas). ''Burford'' allows a federal court to dismiss a case only if:

# The case presents "difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case then at bar," or 
# The adjudication of the case in a federal forum "would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern."&lt;ref&gt;''Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co'', 517 U.S. 706, 727 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Burford'' abstention is closely related to ''Thibodaux'' abstention, derived from ''[[Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux]]'', 360 U.S. 25 (1959), which occurs when a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction chooses to allow a state to decide issues of state law that are of great public importance to that state, to the extent that a federal determination would infringe on state sovereignty. 

Unlike the abstention doctrines raised in federal question cases, there is a strong presumption that federal courts should ''not'' apply ''Burford'' or ''Thibodaux'' Abstention.

===''Colorado River'' abstention===
Finally, ''Colorado River'' abstention, from ''[[Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States]]'', 424 U.S. 800 (1976) comes into play where [[parallel litigation]] is being carried out, particularly where federal and state court proceedings are simultaneously being carried out to determine the rights of parties with respect to the same questions of law. Under such circumstances, it makes little sense for two courts to expend the time and effort to achieve a resolution of the question.

Unlike other abstention doctrines, application of the ''Colorado River'' doctrine is prudential and discretionary, and is based less on [[comity]] or respect between different court systems than on the desire to avoid wasteful duplication of litigation. The classification of the doctrine as a form of abstention has been disputed, with some courts simply calling it a "doctrine of exceptional circumstances". Each of the various federal circuits has come up with its own list of factors to weigh in determining whether a federal court should abstain from hearing a case under this doctrine. Typically, such factors include:
* the order in which the courts assumed jurisdiction over property
* the order in which the courts assumed jurisdiction over the parties
* the relative inconvenience of the fora
* the relative progress of the two actions (added by ''[[Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp.]]'' in 1983)
* the desire to avoid piecemeal litigation
* whether federal law provides the rule of decision
* whether the state court will adequately protect the rights of all parties
* whether the federal filing was vexatious (intended to harass the other party) or reactive (in response to adverse rulings in the state court).

===Note on the ''Rooker-Feldman'' doctrine===
The [[Rooker-Feldman doctrine|''Rooker-Feldman'' doctrine]] has some characteristics of an abstention doctrine, because it prohibits federal court review of state court actions. However, it does not require federal courts to abstain from hearing cases pending action in the state court, but instead deems that federal courts lack [[jurisdiction]] to hear cases already fully decided in state courts. The doctrine is not a judicially created exception to federal jurisdiction. Rather, the Rooker and Feldman cases simply recognized the fact that Congress has not granted the federal district or appeals courts statutory jurisdiction to consider appeals of state court decisions, only the [[US Supreme Court]] via a [[writ of certiorari|writ of ''certiorari'']]). It is an open question whether Congress could grant such jurisdiction.

==State court abstention doctrines==
No national rule requires state courts to abstain from hearing cases brought in federal courts or in courts of other states, though the [[All Writs Act]] permits federal courts to enjoin state courts from hearing matters if necessary to preserve the jurisdiction of the federal court. But every state has some doctrine that lets its courts stay actions to avoid duplicative litigation.

Some states have doctrines that let state courts abstain from hearing cases already pending in other kinds of tribunals. For example, in ''Gavle v. Little Six, Inc.,'' 555 N.W.2d 284 (Minn. 1996), the [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] upheld abstention where the state court might "undermine the authority of the tribal courts over Reservation affairs" or "infringe on the right of Indians to govern themselves".

{{Platonism}}

The '''Analogy of the Divided Line''' ({{lang-grc-gre|γραμμὴ δίχα τετμημένη}}) is presented by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] in the  ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (509d–511e). It is written as a dialogue between [[Glaucon]] and [[Socrates]], in which the latter further elaborates upon the immediately preceding [[Analogy of the Sun]] at the former's request. Socrates asks Glaucon to not only envision this unequally bisected line but to imagine further bisecting each of the two segments. Socrates explains that the four resulting segments represent four separate 'affections' (παθήματα) of the psyche. The lower two sections are said to represent the [[sense|visible]] while the higher two are said to represent the [[Intelligibility (philosophy)#Usage|intelligible]]. These affections are described in succession as corresponding to increasing levels of reality and truth from conjecture ([[Eikasia|εἰκασία]]) to belief ([[:Wiktionary:πίστις|πίστις]]) to thought ([[Dianoia|διάνοια]]) and finally to understanding ([[:Wiktionary:νόησις|νόησις]]). Furthermore, this analogy not only elaborates a theory of the psyche but also presents metaphysical and epistemological views.

This analogy is immediately followed by the [[Analogy of the Cave]] at 514a. Socrates returns once more to the elements of the divided line (533d-534a) as he summarizes his dialectic.

== Description ==
[[Image:DividedLine.svg|frame|left|The Divided Line – ('''AC''') is generally taken as representing the visible world and ('''CE''') as representing the intelligible world.&lt;ref name="CDP"&gt;"divided line," ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-521-63722-8}}, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{clear|left}}

In ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'' (509d–510a), Plato describes the Divided Line this way:

{{quotation|Now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts, and divide each of them again in the same proportion,&lt;ref name="unequal"&gt;Older Greek texts do not differentiate unequal from an equal (ανίσα, αν ίσα)&lt;/ref&gt; and suppose the two main divisions to answer, one to the visible and the other to the intelligible, and then compare the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and want of clearness, and you will find that the first section in the sphere of the visible consists of images. And by images I mean, in the first place, shadows, and in the second place, reflections in water and in solid, smooth and polished bodies and the like: Do you understand?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, I understand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine, now, the other section, of which this is only the resemblance, to include the animals which we see, and everything that grows or is made.&lt;ref name="Republic"&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'', Book 6, translated by [[Benjamin Jowett]], [http://www.filepedia.org/files/Plato%20-%20The%20Republic.pdf online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418215659/http://www.filepedia.org/files/Plato%20-%20The%20Republic.pdf |date=18 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

== The visible world ==
Thus '''AB''' represents shadows and reflections of physical things, and '''BC''' the physical things themselves.  These correspond to two kinds of [[Platonic epistemology|knowledge]], the '''illusion''' (εἰκασία ''[[eikasia]]'') of our ordinary, everyday experience, and '''[[belief]]''' (πίστις ''pistis'') about discrete physical objects which cast their shadows.&lt;ref name="PenguinNotes"&gt;Desmond Lee and Rachana Kamtekar, ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'', Notes to Book 6, Penguin, 1987, {{ISBN|0-14-044914-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', the category of illusion includes all the "opinions of which the minds of ordinary people are full," while the natural sciences are included in the category of belief.&lt;ref name="PenguinNotes" /&gt;

== The intelligible world ==
According to some translations,&lt;ref name="unequal" /&gt; the segment '''CE''', representing the intelligible world, is divided into the same ratio as '''AC''', giving the subdivisions '''CD''' and '''DE''' (it can be readily verified that '''CD''' must have the same length as '''BC''':&lt;ref&gt;Let the length of '''AE''' be equal to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 1&lt;/math&gt; and that of '''AC''' equal to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 0 &lt; x &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; (following Socrates, however, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 0 &lt; x &lt; 1/2&lt;/math&gt;; insofar as the equality of the lengths of '''BC''' and '''CD''' is concerned, the latter restriction is of no significance). The length of '''CE''' is thus equal to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 1-x&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that the length of '''BC''' must be equal to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x - x \times x \equiv (1-x)\times x&lt;/math&gt;, which is seen to be equal to the length of '''CD'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|There are two subdivisions, in the lower of which the soul uses the figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry can only be hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle descends to the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes out of hypotheses, and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses, making no use of images as in the former case, but proceeding only in and through the ideas themselves (510b).&lt;ref name="Republic" /&gt;}}

Plato describes '''CD''', the "lower" of these, as involving '''mathematical reasoning''' (διάνοια ''[[dianoia]]''),&lt;ref name="PenguinNotes" /&gt; where abstract [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|mathematical objects]] such as [[Line (geometry)|geometric lines]] are discussed.  Such objects are outside the physical world (and are not to be confused with the ''drawings'' of those lines, which fall within the physical world '''BC''').  However, they are less important to Plato than the subjects of philosophical '''understanding''' (νόησις ''[[noesis]]''), the "higher" of these two subdivisions ('''DE'''):

{{quotation|And when I speak of the other division of the intelligible, you will understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason herself attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as first principles, but only as hypotheses — that is to say, as steps and points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses, in order that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole (511b).&lt;ref name="Republic" /&gt;}}

Plato here is using the familiar relationship between ordinary objects and their shadows or reflections in order to illustrate the relationship between the physical world as a whole and the world of [[Theory of Forms|Ideas (Forms)]] as a whole.  The former is made up of a series of passing reflections of the latter, which is eternal, more real and "true."  Moreover, the knowledge that we have of the Ideas – when indeed we do have it – is of a higher order than knowledge of the mere physical world.  In particular, knowledge of the forms leads to a knowledge of the [[Form of the Good|Idea (Form) of the Good]].&lt;ref name="CDP" /&gt;

== Metaphysical importance ==
The Allegory of the Divided Line is the cornerstone of Plato's metaphysical framework. This structure, well hidden in the middle of the ''[[Plato's Republic|Republic]]'', a complex, multi-layered dialogue, illustrates the grand picture of Plato's metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics, all in one. It is not enough for the philosopher to understand the Ideas (Forms), he must also understand the relation of Ideas to all four levels of the structure to be able to know anything at all.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Fine, ''Knowledge and Belief in Republic V-VII'', in G. Fine (ed.) ''Plato I'' (1990), also in S. Everson (ed.) ''Cambridge Companions to Ancient Thought I: Epistemology'' (Cambridge University Press: New York, 1990), pp. 85-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Denyer, ''Sun and line: the role of the Good'', in G. R. F. Ferrari (ed.) The Cambridge Companion to Plato's Republic (Cambridge University Press: New York, 2007), pp. 284–309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Republic'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D7%3Asection%3D520c 520c]: "For once habituated ... you will know what each of the ‘idols’ is and whereof it is a semblance, because you have seen the reality of the beautiful, the just and the good."&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Republic'', the philosopher must understand the Idea of Justice to live a just life or to organize and govern a just state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rachelsingpurwalla.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/platos-defense-of-justice.pdf Rachel G.K. Singpurwalla, ''Plato’s Defense of Justice in the Republic''] "justice is a virtue appropriate to both cities and individuals, and the nature or form of justice is the same in both (''Republic'', 435a)."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Divided Line also serves as our guide for most past and future metaphysics. The lowest level, which represents "the world of becoming and passing away" (''Republic'', 508d), is the metaphysical model for a Heraclitean philosophy of constant flux and for Protagorean philosophy of appearance and opinion. The second level, a world of fixed physical objects,&lt;ref name="Danaher"&gt;[http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/lawsofthought.htm James Danaher, ''The Laws of Thought''] "The restrictions Plato places on the laws of thought (i.e., "in the same respect," and "at the same time,") are an attempt to isolate the object of thought by removing it from all other time but the present and all respects but one."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cratylus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Crat.+439d&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0172 439d-e] "For if it is ''ever'' in the same state, then obviously ''at that time'' it is not changing (Plato's realism); and if it is ''always'' in the same state and is always the same, how can it ever change or move without relinquishing its own form (Aristotle's realism)"&lt;/ref&gt; also became Aristotle's metaphysical model. The third level might be a Pythagorean level of mathematics. The fourth level is Plato's ideal Parmenidean reality, the world of highest level Ideas.

== Epistemological meaning ==
Plato holds a very strict notion of knowledge. For example, he does not accept expertise about a subject, nor direct perception (see ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''), nor true belief about the physical world (the ''[[Meno]]'') as knowledge. It is not enough for the philosopher to understand the Ideas (Forms), he must also understand the relation of Ideas to all four levels of the structure to be able to know anything at all.&lt;ref&gt;''Republic'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D7%3Apage%3D520 520c] "For once habituated you will discern them infinitely better than the dwellers there, and you will ''know'' what each of the ‘idols’ is and whereof it is a semblance, because you have seen the reality of the beautiful, the just and the good."&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, in most of the "earlier Socratic" dialogues, Socrates denies knowledge both to himself and others.

For the first level, "the world of becoming and passing away," Plato expressly denies the possibility of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Cratylus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Crat.+439d&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0172 439d-e] "How, then, can that which is never in the same state be anything? ... nor can it be known by anyone."&lt;/ref&gt; Constant change never stays the same, therefore, properties of objects must refer to different Ideas at different times. Note that for knowledge to be possible, which Plato believed, the other three levels must be unchanging. The third and fourth level, mathematics and Ideas, are already eternal and unchanging. However, to ensure that the second level, the objective, physical world, is also unchanging, Plato, in the ''Republic'', Book 4&lt;ref&gt;''Republic'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D4%3Asection%3D436b 4.436b] "It is obvious that the same thing will never do or suffer opposites in the same respect in relation to the same thing and at the same time"&lt;/ref&gt; introduces empirically derived&lt;ref&gt;''Republic'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D4%3Asection%3D437a 4.437a] "let us proceed on the ''hypothesis'' that this is so, with the understanding that, if it ever appear otherwise, everything that results from the assumption shall be invalidated"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see the ''Timaeus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0180%3Atext%3DTim.%3Asection%3D29c 29c] on empirical "likelihood"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is interesting to note that  modern logical analysis claims to prove that the potentially falsifiable "empirical content of a theory is exactly captured by ... axiomatization ... that uses axioms which are universal negations of conjunctions of atomic formulas" [http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~fede/wp/empirical.pdf (C. Chambers, ''The Axiomatic Structure of Empirical Content'')] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627005606/http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~fede/wp/empirical.pdf |date=27 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[axiom]]atic restrictions that prohibit both motion and shifting perspectives.&lt;ref name="Danaher" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato's [[Principle of Non-Contradiction]] (''Republic'', 4.436b) for the objective, physical world is presented with three ''axiomatic'' restrictions: The same thing ... cannot act or be acted upon ... in contrary ways ... (1) in the same part (2) in relation to the same thing (3) at the same time.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avoidance speech''' is a group of sociolinguistic phenomena in which a special restricted speech style must be used in the presence of or in reference to certain relatives. Avoidance speech is found in many [[Australian Aboriginal languages]]&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, R.M.W. (1980). "Speech and song styles: Avoidance styles". In ''The languages of Australia'' (Sections 3.3–3.4, pp. 58–68). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Austronesian languages]]&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Gary. 1982. Word taboo and comparative Austronesian linguistics. ''Pacific Linguistics'' C–76:157–226.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some [[North American languages]], [[Highland East Cushitic languages]]&lt;ref&gt;Treis, Yvonne. 2005. Avoiding their names, avoiding their eyes: How Kambaata women respect their in-laws. ''Anthrolological Linguistics'' 47.3:292–320&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bantu languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, Robert K. 1990. ''Hlonipha'' and the Ambiguous Woman. ''Anthropos'' 85:455–473.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avoidance speech styles tend to have the same [[phonology]] and [[grammar]] as the standard language they are a part of. The [[lexicon]], however, tends to be smaller than in normal speech since the styles are only used for limited communication.

==Australia==
Avoidance speech in [[Australian Aboriginal languages]] is closely tied to elaborate tribal kinship systems in which certain relatives are considered [[taboo]]. Avoidance relations differ from tribe to tribe in terms of strictness and to whom they apply. Typically, there is an avoidance relationship between a man and his mother-in-law, usually between a woman and her father-in-law, and sometimes between any person and their parent-in-law of the same sex. For some tribes, avoidance relationships are extended to other family members, such as the mother-in-law's brother in [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] or [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross-cousins]] in [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]]. All relations are [[classificatory kinship|classificatory]] – more people may fall into the "mother-in-law" category than just a man's wife's mother.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1980: 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

Avoidance speech styles used with taboo relatives are often called '''mother-in-law languages''', although they are not actually separate languages but separate [[lexical set]]s with the same [[grammar]] and [[phonology]]. Typically, the taboo lexical set has a one-to-many correspondence with the everyday set. For example, in Dyirbal the avoidance style has one word, ''jijan'', for all lizards and iguanas while the everyday style differentiates many varieties. In [[Guugu Yimithirr language|Guugu Yimidhirr]] the avoidance speech verb ''bali-l'' "travel" covers several everyday verbs meaning "go", "walk", "crawl", "paddle", "float, sail, drift", and "limp along". Corresponding avoidance and everyday words are generally not linguistically related. Avoidance forms tend to be longer than everyday forms.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1980:  61–64&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, the avoidance style is used by both members of the avoidance relationship; in others the older member may talk to the younger in everyday style. Behavior associated with avoidance speech is a continuum and varies between tribes. For the Dyirbal people, a man and his mother-in-law may not make eye contact, face one another or directly talk to each other. Rather, they must address a third person or even a nearby object. For slightly less restricted relationships, such as between a man and his father-in-law, avoidance style is used and must be spoken in a slow, soft voice. An extreme case of avoidance behavior is found in the [[Umpila language|Umpila]], in which a man and his mother-in-law may not speak at all in each other’s presence.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1980: 59–60&lt;/ref&gt;

Children in these cultures acquire avoidance speech forms as part of their normal language development, learning with whom to use them at a fairly young age.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1980: 60&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a few languages have another style, called a "secret language" or "mystic language", that is taught to boys as part of initiation rituals, and is only used between men.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1980: 65–68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
A special system of avoidance vocabulary is traditionally used by married women speaking [[Highland East Cushitic languages]] in southwestern Ethiopia. In [[Kambaata language|Kambaata]] and [[Sidamo language|Sidamo]], this system is called ''ballishsha'', and includes physical and linguistic avoidance of parents-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;Anbessa Tefera. 1987. Ballissha : Women's Speech Among the Sidama, ''Journal of Ethiopian Studies'', vol. XX, pp. 44–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Women who practice ''ballishsha'' do not pronounce any words beginning with the same syllable as the name of their husband’s mother or father.&lt;ref&gt;Treis 2005: 292–294&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they may use [[paraphrase]], synonyms or semantically similar words, antonyms, or [[loanword|borrowings]] from other languages.&lt;ref&gt;Treis 2005: 295&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hlonipha'', or ''isihlonipho'', is a traditional system of avoidance speech in [[Nguni languages|Nguni Bantu languages]] of southern Africa including [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Swazi language|Swazi]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert 1990: 456&lt;/ref&gt; This special speech style and correlating respectful behaviors may be used in many contexts, but is most strongly associated with married women in respect to their father-in-law and other senior male relatives. Women who practice ''hlonipha'' may not say the names of these men or any words with the same [[Root (linguistics)|root]] as their names.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert 1990:457–459&lt;/ref&gt; They avoid the taboo words phonologically (substituting sounds) or lexically (substituting words with synonyms, etc.). The ''hlonipha'' system also includes avoidance of the names of certain relatives by all speakers and physical avoidance of certain relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert 1990: 460–461&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking a [[behavior informatics]] perspective, a behavior consists of behavior actor, operation, interactions, and their properties. A behavior can be represented as a behavior vector.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cao|first=Longbing|date=|year=2010|title=In-depth Behavior Understanding and Use: the Behavior Informatics Approach|url=|journal=Information Science|volume=180|issue=17|pages=3067–3085|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==

===Biology===
{{Main|Behavioral ecology}}

Although there is some disagreement as to how to precisely define behavior in a biological context, one common interpretation based on a meta-analysis of scientific literature states that "behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levitis|first=Daniel |author2=William Z. Lidicker, Jr |author3=Glenn Freund|title=Behavioural biologists do not agree on what constitutes behaviour|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=June 2009|volume=78|pages=103–10|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2009.03.018 |url=http://academic.reed.edu/biology/courses/bio342/2010_syllabus/2010_readings/levitis_etal_2009.pdf|pmc=2760923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broader definition of behavior, applicable to plants and other organisms, is similar to the concept of [[phenotypic plasticity]]. It describes behavior as a response to an event or environment change during the course of the lifetime of an individual, differing from other physiological or biochemical changes that occurs more rapidly, and excluding changes that are result of development ([[ontogeny]]).&lt;ref&gt;Karban, R. (2008). Plant behaviour and communication. ''Ecology Letters'' 11 (7): 727–739, [http://169.237.77.3/news/PlantBehavior.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004074635/http://169.237.77.3/news/PlantBehavior.pdf |date=4 October 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karban, R. (2015). Plant Behavior and Communication. In: ''Plant Sensing and Communication''. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, pp. 1-8, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8HOeCQAAQBAJ].&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviors can be either [[innate]] or learned from the environment.

Behavior can be regarded as any action of an organism that changes its relationship to its environment. Behavior provides outputs from the organism to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Dusenbery, David B. (2009). ''Living at Micro Scale'', p. 124. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts {{ISBN|978-0-674-03116-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human behavior===
{{Main|Human behavior}}

Human behavior is believed to be influenced by the [[endocrine system]] and the [[nervous system]]. It is most commonly believed that complexity in the behavior of an organism is correlated to the complexity of its nervous system. Generally, organisms with more complex nervous systems have a greater capacity to [[learn]] new responses and thus adjust their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Book of Alan: A Universal Order|last=Gregory|first=Alan|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=978-1-5144-2053-9|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer behavior==

'''Consumers behavior'''

[[Consumer behavior]] refers to the processes consumers go through, and reactions they have towards products or services&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dowhan|first=David|date=June 1, 2013|title=Hitting Your Target|url=Retrieved from http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=f98b06cd-8924-4f6d-89f8-245bde9615f8%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=124|journal=Marketing Insights|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-03-30}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Dowhan, 2013). It is to do with consumption, and the processes consumers go through around purchasing and consuming goods and services&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szwacka-Mokrzycka|first=Joanna|date=2015|title=TRENDS IN CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR CHANGES. OVERVIEW OF CONCEPTS.|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=83b2b7c5-d287-4702-8baf-b8b9d6665410%40sessionmgr4004&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl&amp;preview=false#AN=112782281&amp;db=bth|journal=Acta Scientiarum Polonorum. Oeconomia|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-03-30}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Szwacka-Mokrzycka, 2015).  Consumers recognise needs or wants, and go through a process to satisfy these needs. Consumer behavior is the process they go through as customers, which includes types of products purchased, amount spent, frequency of purchases and what influences them to make the purchase decision or not. There is a lot that influences consumer behavior, with contributions from both internal and external factors&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Szwacka-Mokrzycka, 2015). Internal factors include attitudes, needs, motives, preferences and perceptual processes, whilst external factors include marketing activities, social and economic factors, and cultural aspects&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Szwacka-Mokrzycka, 2015). Doctor Lars Perner of the University of Southern California claims that there are also physical factors that influence consumer behavior, for example if a consumer is hungry, then this physical feeling of hunger will influence them so that they go and purchase a sandwich to satisfy the hunger&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerpsychologist.com/intro_Consumer_Behavior.html|title=Consumer Behaviour|last=Perner|first=Lars|date=2008|website=Consumer Psychologist|publisher=|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Perner, 2008).

'''Consumer decision making'''

There is a model described by Lars Perner which illustrates the decision making process with regards to consumer behavior. It begins with recognition of a problem, the consumer recognises a need or want which has not been satisfied. This leads the consumer to search for information, if it is a low involvement product then the search will be internal, identifying alternatives purely from memory. If the product is high involvement then the search be more thorough, such as reading reviews or reports or asking friends. The consumer will then evaluate his or her alternatives, comparing price, quality, doing trade-offs between products and narrowing down the choice by eliminating the less appealing products until there is one left. After this has been identified, the consumer will purchase the product. Finally the consumer will evaluate the purchase decision, and the purchased product, bringing in factors such as value for money, quality of goods and purchase experience&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (Model taken from Perner, 2008).

'''How the 4P's influence consumer behavior'''

The [[Marketing mix|4 P's]] are a marketing tool, and stand for Price, Promotion, Product and Place or Product Placement&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clemons|first=Eric|date=2008|title=How Information Changes Consumer Behavior and How Consumer Behavior Determines Corporate Strategy|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=32c58928-1d36-4594-90d4-e5f7569a77f1%40sessionmgr198&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=116&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl&amp;preview=false#AN=34879420&amp;db=bth|journal=Journal of Management Information Systems|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Clemons, 2008).  Consumer behavior is influenced greatly by business to consumer marketing, so being a prominent marketing tool, the 4 P's will have an effect on consumer's behavior. The price of a good or service is largely determined by the market, as businesses will set their prices to be similar to that of other business so as to remain competitive whilst making a profit&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (Clemons, 2008). When market prices for a product are high, it will cause consumers to purchase less and use purchased goods for longer periods of time, meaning they are purchasing the product less often. Alternatively, when market prices for a product are low, consumers are more likely to purchase more of the product, and more often. The way that promotion influences consumer behavior has changed over time. In the past, large promotional campaigns and lots of advertising would convert into sales for a business, but nowadays businesses can have success on products with little or no advertising&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (Clemons, 2008). This is due to the internet, and in particular social media. They rely on word of mouth from consumers using social media, and as products trend online, so sales increase as products effectively promote themselves&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (Clemons, 2008). Thus, promotion by businesses does not necessarily result in consumer behavior trending towards purchasing products.  The way that product influences consumer behavior is through consumer willingness to pay, and consumer preferences&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (Clemons, 2008). This means that even if a company were to have a long history of products in the market, consumers will still pick a cheaper product over the company in question's product if it means they will pay less for something that is very similar&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (Clemons, 2008). This is due to consumer willingness to pay, or their willingness to part with their money they have earned. Product also influences consumer behavior through customer preferences. For example, take Pepsi vs Coca-Cola, a Pepsi drinker is less likely to purchase Coca-Cola, even if it is cheaper and more convenient. This is due to the preference of the consumer, and no matter how hard the opposing company tries they will not be able to force the customer to change their mind. Product placement in the modern era has little influence on consumer behavior, due to the availability of goods online&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; (Clemons, 2008). If a customer can purchase a good from the comfort of their home instead of purchasing in-store, then the placement of products is not going to influence their purchase decision.

==In management==

'''Behavior outside of psychology includes''':

===Organizational===

In management, behaviors are associated with desired or undesired focuses.  Managers generally note what the desired outcome is, but behavioral patterns can take over.  These patterns are the reference to how often the desired behavior actually occurs.  Before a behavior actually occurs, antecedents focus on the stimuli that influence the behavior that is about to happen.  After the behavior occurs, consequences fall into place.  Consequences consist of rewards or punishments.

==Health==

{{See also|Health belief model|Theory of planned behavior|Transtheoretical model|Self-efficacy}}
Health behavior refers to a person's beliefs and actions regarding their health and [[well-being]]. Health behaviors are direct factors in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Health behaviors are influenced by the social, cultural and physical environments in which we live and work. They are shaped by individual choices and external constraints. Positive behaviors help promote health and prevent disease, while the opposite is true for risk behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-229-x/2009001/deter/int3-eng.htm|title=Health behaviours|author=|date=11 January 2010|work=statcan.gc.ca|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health behaviors are early indicators of population health. Because of the time lag that often occurs between certain behaviors and the development of disease, these indicators may foreshadow the future burdens and benefits of health-risk and health-promoting behaviors. Health behaviors do not occur in isolation—they are influenced and constrained by social and cultural norms.

===Correlates===

A variety of studies have examined the relationship between health behaviors and health outcomes (e.g., Blaxter 1990) and have demonstrated their role in both morbidity and mortality.

These studies have identified seven features of lifestyle which were associated with lower morbidity and higher subsequent long-term survival (Belloc and Breslow 1972):
* Avoiding snacks
* Eating  breakfast regularly
* Exercising regularly
* Maintaining a desirable body weight
* Moderate alcohol intake
* Not smoking
* Sleeping 7–8h per night

Health behaviors impact upon individuals' quality of life, by delaying the onset of chronic disease and extending active lifespan. Smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, gaps in primary care services and low screening uptake are all significant determinants of poor health, and changing such behaviors should lead to improved health.
For example, in USA, Healthy People 2000, [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (USDHHS), lists increased physical activity, changes in nutrition and reductions in tobacco, alcohol and drug use as important for health promotion and disease prevention.

===Treatment approach===

Any interventions done are matched with the needs of each individual in an ethical and respected manner. [[Health belief model|HBM]] encourages increasing individuals' perceived susceptibility to negative health outcomes and making individuals aware of the severity of such negative health behavior outcomes. E.g. through health promotion messages. In addition, the HBM suggests the need to focus on the benefits of health behaviors and the fact that barriers to action are easily overcome. The [[theory of planned behavior]] (TPB) suggests using persuasive messages for tackling behavioral beliefs to increase the readiness to perform a behavior, called ''intentions''. TPB advocates the need to tackle normative beliefs and control beliefs in any attempt to change behavior. Challenging the normative beliefs isn't enough but to follow through the ''intention'' with self-efficacy from individual's mastery in problem solving and task completion is important to bring about a positive change.&lt;ref&gt;Gollwitzer 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Self efficacy is often cemented through standard persuasive techniques.

'''Betsy Graves Reyneau''' (1888–1964) was an [[United States|American]] painter, best known for a series of portraits of prominent [[African American]]s once owned by the [[Harmon Foundation]]. [[Mary McLeod Bethune]], [[George Washington Carver]], [[Joe Louis]], and [[Thurgood Marshall]] were among her sitters.

== Early life ==
Reyneau was raised in [[Detroit]], and although discouraged by her father from becoming an artist on the grounds that it was inappropriate for a woman, she broke ties with the family to pursue that career, and as a young woman attended the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]. She later lived in France for a time before returning to the United States and becoming active in civil rights causes. She was later selected by the Circuit Court of Detroit, unbeknownst to her family, to paint a portrait of her grandfather, Michigan Supreme Court Justice [[Benjamin F. Graves]]. Reyneau was also a [[suffragette]]; she became, in 1917, one of the first woman to be arrested and imprisoned for protesting [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s stance on women's voting rights.&lt;ref name="Fifteen"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyaxYvSG6gAC|title=After the Vote Was Won: The Later Achievements of Fifteen Suffragists|last=Adams|first=Katherine H.|last2=Keene|first2=Michael L.|publisher=McFarland|year=2010|isbn=9780786456475|location=|pages=57–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Many of Reyneau's portraits are currently in the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.67.81|title=Aaron Douglas|last=|first=|date=|website=National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.67.77|title=Richmond Barthe|last=|first=|date=|website=National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was inducted into the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]].

'''Chakravarti''' ([[Sanskrit]] [http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?tran_input=cakravartin&amp;direct=se&amp;script=hk&amp;link=yes&amp;mode=3 चक्रवर्तिन्] ''cakravartin'', [[Pali]] ''cakkavattin'') {{bo|t=འཁོར་ལོས་སྒྱུར་བའི་རྒྱལ་པོ་ |w=khor los bsgyur ba'i rgyal po}},  is a [[Sanskrit]] term used to refer to an ideal universal ruler&lt;ref name=Madan&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 81|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; who rules ethically and benevolently over the entire world.
{{Indo-Persian royal and noble ranks}}
Such a ruler's reign is called ''sarvabhauma''. The word is a [[bahuvrihi|bahuvrīhi]] compound word, figuratively meaning "whose wheels are moving", in the sense of "whose chariot is rolling everywhere without obstruction". It can also be analysed as an 'instrumental bahuvrīhi: "through whom the wheel is moving" in the meaning of "through whom the [[Dharmachakra]] ("Wheel of the [[Dharma]]) is turning" (most commonly used in Buddhism). The Tibetan word translates "monarch who controls by means of a wheel".

[[File:Indian_relief_from_Amaravati,_Guntur._Preserved_in_Guimet_Museum.jpg|thumb|Possibly [[Ashoka]] of [[Mauryan Empire]] at [[Guimet Museum]].]]
The first references to a ''Chakravala Chakravartin'' appear in monuments from the time of the [[Maurya Empire]] (322–185 BCE), dedicated to [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and his grandson [[Ashoka]]. In Buddhism, the Chakravarti came to be considered the secular counterpart of a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]. In general, the term applies to temporal as well as spiritual kingship and leadership, particularly in [[Buddhist kingship|Buddhism]] and Jainism. In [[Hinduism]], the term generally denotes a powerful ruler whose dominion extended to the entire earth.

== Hindu tradition ==

New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt; a concept associated with the [[Bhagavata]] [[Puranas]], a religious sanction traceable to the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period,&lt;ref&gt;Śrīrāma Goyala, (1967). A history of the Imperial Guptas, p.137. Central Book Depot.&lt;/ref&gt; which also led to the Chakravartin Concept.&lt;ref name=begley65&gt;Wayne Edison Begley (1973). Viṣṇu's flaming wheel: the iconography of the Sudarśana-cakra, p.65. Volume 27 of Monographs on archaeology and fine arts. New York University Press&lt;/ref&gt; There are relatively few examples of chakravartins in both northern and southern India.

In Southern India, the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava period]] beginning with Simhavishnu (575 CE{{Dash}}900 CE) was a transitional stage in southern Indian society with monument building, establishment of (bhakti) sects of [[Alvars]] and [[Nayanars]], flowering of rural Brahmanical institutions of Sanskrit learning, and the establishment of ''Chakravartin'' model of kingship over a territory of diverse people; which ended the pre-Pallavan era of territorially segmented people, each with their culture, under a tribal chieftain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Burton Stein|title=Peasant state and society in medieval South India |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1980|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] period extolled ranked relationships based on ritual purity as enjoined by the ''shastras''.&lt;ref name=stein&gt;{{cite book|author=Burton Stein|title=Peasant state and society in medieval South India |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1980|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burton distinguishes between the ''Chakravatin'' model and the ''[[Kshatriya]]'' model, and likens kshatriyas to locally based warriors with ritual status sufficiently high enough to share with ''[[Brahmin]]s''; and states that in south India the kshatriya model did not emerge.&lt;ref name=stein/&gt; As per Burton, South India was aware of the Indo-Aryan ''Varna'' organized society in which decisive secular authority was vested in the ''Kshatriyas''; but apart from the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]], [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] and [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] line of warriors which claimed ''Chakravartin'' status, only few locality warrior families achieved the prestigious kin-linked organization of northern warrior groups.&lt;ref name=stein/&gt;

==Jain tradition==
{{Main|Salakapurusa}}

[[File:14 Ratna of Chakravartin.png|thumb|14 Ratnas of Chakravartin]]
During the each motion of the half-cycle of the wheel of time, 63 Salakapurusa or 63 illustrious men, consisting of the 12 Chakravartin regularly appear.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=}}{{sfn|Doniger|1999|p=550}} The [[Jain cosmology]] or legendary history is basically a compilation of the deeds of these illustrious men. As per Jain cosmology, Chakravartins are ''Universal Monarchs'' or ''World Conquerors''. Golden in complexion, they all belonged to the ''[[Kasyapa]]'' [[gotra]]. The mother of a Chakravartin sees some dreams at the time of conception. A chakravartin is considered an ideal human being endowed with thirty-two major signs of excellence and many minor signs of excellence.

The list of 12 chakravartin of ''Avasarpini'' as per [[Jainism]] is as follows&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Jagmanderlal |last=Jaini |title=Outlines of Jainism |editor=F.W. Thomas}} appendix III.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, a Chakravartin Samrat was characterised by his possession of ''Saptaratna'', or "Seven Jewels":{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
#Ratna-Chakra, a miraculous diamond serrated discus that never misses its target
#Empress
#Divine Jewellery
#Immense Wealth

Some lists cite [[navaratna]] or "nine jewels" instead, adding "[[Prime Minister]]" and "[[Son]]".{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==The Cakravarti King in Buddhism==
[[File:Mandala of the Six Chakravartins.JPG|thumb|Tibetan [[mandala]] of the six chakravartis]]
The concept of the cakravarti existed in Buddhism as well as in Jainism. The [[Early Buddhism|Buddhist]] ''[[Mahāvastu]]'' (1.259f) and the ''[[Divyavadana|Divyāvadāna]]'', as well as the [[Theravada|Theravadin]] [[Milinda Panha|Milindapañha]], describe the marks of the cakravarti as ruler: {{IAST|[[Ushnisha|''uṣṇīṣa'']]}}, [[chhatra]] "parasol", "horn jewel" or [[vajra]], [[whisk]] and [[sandal]]s. These were the marks of the [[kshatriya]]. Plastic art of early [[Mahayana]] Buddhism illustrates [[bodhisattva]]s in a form called {{IAST|''uṣṇīṣin''}} "wearing a turban/hair binding", wielding the mudras for "nonviolent cakravarti rule".&lt;ref name=Falk&gt;Falk, Harry, "Small-Scale Buddhism" in {{cite book|editor1-last=Voegeli|editor1-first=François|editor2-last=Eltschinger|editor2-first=Vincent|editor3-last=Candotti|editor3-first=Maria Piera|editor4-last=Diaconescu|editor4-first=Bogdan|editor5-last=Kulkarni|editor5-first=Malhar|title=Devadattīyam : Johannes Bronkhorst felicitation volume|date=2012|publisher=Peter Lang|location=Bern|isbn=9783034306829}}, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt;

A Cakravarti King is a king who rules all of the great continents (Pubbavideha, Jambudipa, 
Aparagoyana, Uttarakuru) of earth. The King wins all of the continents with peace. Since he's virtuous, seven miracle treasures appear including a large wheel spinning (Chakraratnaya) in the sky. King and his army can travel anywhere with that spinning wheel in the sky. He travels over the world and teaches all kings how to rule with peace [[Dasavidha-rājadhamma]]. He can travel to the lower heaven realms with the power of Chakraratnaya if he wants. Cakravarti king only appears when humans are virtuous and long lived. [[Jataka tales]] a part of the [[Pali Canon]] describe Buddhist Cakravarti Kings.

'''Communal reinforcement''' is a [[Socialization|social phenomenon]] in which a concept or idea is repeatedly asserted in a [[community]], regardless of whether sufficient [[empirical evidence]] has been presented to support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=6FPqDFx40vYC |page=80 |title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the concept or idea is reinforced to become a strong [[belief]] in many people's minds, and may be regarded by the members of the community as fact. Often, the concept or idea may be further reinforced by publications in the [[mass media]], [[literature|books]], or other means of communication.  The phrase "millions of people can't all be wrong" is indicative of the common tendency to accept a communally reinforced idea without question, which often aids in the widespread acceptance of [[factoids]]. A very similar term to this term is '''community-reinforcement''', which is a [[behavioral]] method to stop drug addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=yhWB-JOQMUgC |page=149 |title=Introduction to Addictive Behaviors }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community-reinforcement (behaviourism)==
The community-reinforcement approach (CRA) is an [[alcoholism]] [[therapy|treatment]] approach that aims to achieve abstinence by eliminating [[positive reinforcement]] for drinking and enhancing positive reinforcement for sobriety. CRA integrates several treatment components, including building the client's motivation to quit drinking, helping the client initiate sobriety, analyzing the client's drinking pattern, increasing positive reinforcement, learning new coping behaviors, and involving significant others in the recovery process. These components can be adjusted to the individual client's needs to achieve optimal treatment outcome. In addition, treatment outcome can be influenced by factors such as therapist style and initial treatment intensity. Several studies have provided evidence for CRA's effectiveness in achieving abstinence. Furthermore, CRA has been successfully integrated with a variety of other treatment approaches, such as family therapy and motivational interviewing, and has been tested in the treatment of other drug abuse.&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh23-2/116-121.pdf.html{{dead link|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chris Stout (psychologist)|Chris E. Stout]]'s book ''The Psychology of Terrorism: Theoretical Understandings and Perspective'', Stout explains how community reinforcement is present in the psychotic state of [[terrorists]]. "The individual would feel less charged, validated, courageous, sanctified, and zealous, and would feel exposed as an individual." It is believed that the group mentality of a [[terrorist organization]] solidifies the mission of the group through communal reinforcement. Members are more likely to stay dedicated and follow through with the event of terror if they receive support from fellow terrorist members. An individual might abandon the mission in terror, but with the reinforcement of his peers, a member is more likely to stay involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=5BHgVzlHGYUC |page=131 |title=The Psychology of Terrorism: Theoretical Understandings and Perspectives }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In applied mathematics, '''complementary sequences''' ('''CS''') are pairs of [[sequence]]s with the useful property that their out-of-phase aperiodic [[autocorrelation]] coefficients sum to zero. Binary complementary sequences were first introduced by [[Marcel J. E. Golay]] in 1949. In 1961–1962 Golay gave several methods for constructing sequences of length 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; and gave examples of complementary sequences of lengths 10 and 26.  In 1974 R. J. Turyn gave a method for constructing sequences of length ''mn'' from sequences of lengths ''m'' and ''n'' which allows the construction of sequences of any length of the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;''K''&lt;/sup&gt;26&lt;sup&gt;''M''&lt;/sup&gt;.

Later the theory of complementary sequences was generalized by other authors to polyphase complementary sequences, multilevel complementary sequences, and arbitrary complex complementary sequences. '''Complementary sets''' have also been considered; these can contain more than two sequences.

== Definition ==

Let (''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;) be a pair of bipolar sequences, meaning that ''a''(''k'') and ''b''(''k'') have values +1 or &amp;minus;1. Let the aperiodic [[autocorrelation function]] of the sequence '''x''' be defined by

:&lt;math&gt;R_x(k)=\sum_{j=0}^{N-k-1} x_jx_{j+k}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then the pair of sequences ''a'' and ''b'' is complementary if:

:&lt;math&gt;R_a(k) + R_b(k) = 0,\, &lt;/math&gt;

for ''k'' = 1, ..., ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

Or using [[Kronecker delta]] we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;R_a(k) + R_b(k) = 2N\delta(k),\, &lt;/math&gt;

So we can say that the sum of autocorrelation functions of complementary sequences is a delta function, which is an ideal autocorrelation for many applications like [[radar]] [[pulse compression]] and [[spread spectrum]] [[telecommunications]].

== Examples ==

* As the simplest example we have sequences of length 2: (+1,&amp;nbsp;+1) and (+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1). Their autocorrelation functions are (2,&amp;nbsp;1) and (2,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1), which add up to (4,&amp;nbsp;0).
* As the next example (sequences of length 4), we have (+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1) and (+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1). Their autocorrelation functions are (4,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1) and (4,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1), which add up to (8,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0).
* One example of length 8 is (+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1) and (+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1). Their autocorrelation functions are (8,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1) and (8,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;3,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1).
* An example of length 10 given by Golay is (+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1) and (+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;+1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1). Their autocorrelation functions are (10,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;3,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;minus;2,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;1) and (10,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;2,&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1).

== Properties of complementary pairs of sequences ==

* Complementary [[sequences]] have complementary spectra. As the autocorrelation function and the power spectra form a Fourier pair, complementary sequences also have complementary spectra. But as the Fourier transform of a delta function is a constant, we can write

:: &lt;math&gt;S_a + S_b = C_S,&lt;/math&gt;

: where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; is a constant.

: ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; are defined as a squared magnitude of the [[Fourier transform]] of the sequences. The Fourier transform can be a direct DFT of the sequences, it can be a DFT of zero padded sequences or it can be a continuous Fourier transform of the sequences which is equivalent to the [[Z transform]] for {{math|1=''Z'' = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''j''ω&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

* CS spectra is upper bounded. As ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; are non-negative values we can write

:: &lt;math&gt;S_a = C_S - S_b &lt; C_S,&lt;/math&gt;

: also

:: &lt;math&gt;S_b &lt; C_S.&lt;/math&gt;

* If either of the sequences of the CS pair is inverted (multiplied by −1) they remain complementary. More generally if any of the sequences is multiplied by ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''j''φ&lt;/sup&gt; they remain complementary;
* If either of the sequences is reversed they remain complementary;
* If either of the sequences is delayed they remain complementary;
* If the sequences are interchanged they remain complementary;
* If both sequences are multiplied by the same constant (real or complex) they remain complementary;
* If both sequences are decimated in time by ''K'' they remain complementary. More precisely if from a complementary pair (''a''(''k''), ''b''(''k'')) we form a new pair (''a''(''Nk''), ''b''(''Nk'')) with skipped samples discarded then the new sequences are complementary.
* If alternating bits of both sequences are inverted they remain complementary. In general for arbitrary complex sequences if both sequences are multiplied by ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&amp;pi;''kn''/''N''&lt;/sup&gt; (where ''k'' is a constant and ''n'' is the time index) they remain complementary;
* A new pair of complementary sequences can be formed as [''a'' ''b''] and [''a''&amp;nbsp;−''b''] where [..] denotes concatenation and ''a'' and ''b'' are a pair of CS;
* A new pair of sequences can be formed as {''a'' ''b''} and {''a''&amp;nbsp;−''b''} where {..} denotes [[Interleave sequence|interleaving]] of sequences.
* A new pair of sequences can be formed as ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'' and ''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b''.

==Golay pair==
A complementary pair ''a'', ''b'' may be encoded as polynomials ''A''(''z'') = ''a''(0) + ''a''(1)''z'' + ... + ''a''(''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)''z''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; and similarly for ''B''(''z'').  The complementarity property of the sequences is equivalent to the condition

:&lt;math&gt;\vert A(z) \vert^2 + \vert B(z) \vert^2 = 2N \, &lt;/math&gt;

for all ''z'' on the unit circle, that is, |''z''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  If so, ''A'' and ''B'' form a '''Golay pair''' of polynomials.  Examples include the [[Shapiro polynomials]], which give rise to complementary sequences of length a power of&amp;nbsp;2.

'''Conceptual graphs''' ('''CGs''') are a formalism for [[knowledge representation]]. In the first published paper on CGs, [[John F. Sowa]] {{harv|Sowa|1976}} used them to represent the [[conceptual schema]]s used in [[database system]]s. The first book on CGs {{harv|Sowa|1984}} applied them to a wide range of topics in [[artificial intelligence]], [[computer science]], and [[cognitive science]].

== Since 1984, the model has been developed along three main directions: ==

=== A graphical interface for first-order logic ===
[[Image:Cat-on-mat.svg|thumb|left|250px|Elsie the cat is sitting on a mat]]
In this approach, a formula in [[first-order logic]] (predicate calculus) is represented by a labeled graph.

A linear notation, called the Conceptual Graph Interchange Format (CGIF), has been standardized in the [[ISO standard]] for [[common logic]].

The diagram above is an example of the ''display form'' for a conceptual graph. Each box is called a ''concept node'', and each oval is called a ''relation node''. In CGIF, this CG would be represented by the following statement:

{{code|[Cat Elsie] [Sitting *x] [Mat *y] (agent ?x Elsie) (location ?x ?y)}}

In CGIF, brackets enclose the information inside the concept nodes, and parentheses enclose the information inside the relation nodes. The letters x and y, which are called ''coreference labels'', show how the concept and relation nodes are connected. In CLIF, those letters are mapped to variables, as in the following statement:

{{code|(exists ((x Sitting) (y Mat)) (and (Cat Elsie) (agent x Elsie) (location x y)))}}

As this example shows, the asterisks on the coreference labels {{code|*x}} and {{code|*y}} in CGIF map to existentially quantified variables in CLIF, and the question marks on {{code|?x}} and {{code|?y}} map to bound variables in CLIF. A universal quantifier, represented {{code|@every*z}} in CGIF, would be represented {{code|forall (z)}} in CLIF.

Reasoning can be done by translating graphs into logical formulas, then applying a logical inference engine.

=== Diagrammatic calculus of logics ===
Another research branch continues the work on [[existential graph]]s of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], which were one of the origins of conceptual graphs as proposed by Sowa. In this approach, developed in particular by Dau {{harv|Dau|2003}}, conceptual graphs are conceptual [[diagram]]s rather than graphs in the sense of [[graph theory]], and reasoning operations are performed by operations on these diagrams.

=== Graph-based knowledge representation and reasoning model ===
Key features of GBKR, the graph-based knowledge representation and reasoning model developed by Chein and Mugnier and the Montpellier group {{harv|Chein|Mugnier|2009}}, can be summarized as follows:

* All kinds of knowledge (ontology, rules, constraints and facts) are labeled graphs, which provide an intuitive and easily understandable means to represent knowledge.
* Reasoning mechanisms are based on graph notions, basically the classical notion of [[graph homomorphism]]; this allows, in particular, to link basic reasoning problems to other fundamental problems in computer science (problems concerning [[Conjunctive query|conjunctive queries]] in [[relational database]]s, [[constraint satisfaction problem]], etc.
* The formalism is logically founded, i.e., it has a semantics in [[first-order logic]] and the inference mechanisms are sound and complete with respect to deduction in first-order logic.
* From a computational viewpoint, the graph homomorphism notion was recognized in the 1990s as a central notion, and complexity results and efficient algorithms have been obtained in several domains.

COGITANT and COGUI are tools that implement the GBKR model. COGITANT is a library of [[C++]] classes that implement most of the GBKR notions and reasoning mechanisms. COGUI is a graphical user interface dedicated to the construction of a GBKR knowledge base (it integrates COGITANT and, among numerous functionalities, it contains a translator from GBKR to [[RDF Schema|RDF/S]] and conversely).

==== Sentence generalization and generalization diagrams ====
Sentence [[generalization]] and generalization diagrams can be defined as a special sort of conceptual graphs which can be constructed automatically from syntactic [[parse tree]]s and support semantic classification task {{harv|Galitsky et al|2010}}. Similarity measure between syntactic parse trees can be done as a generalization operation on the lists of sub-trees of these trees. The diagrams are representation of mapping between the [[syntax]] generalization level and [[semantics]] generalization level (anti-unification of [[logic forms]]). Generalization diagrams are intended to be more accurate semantic representation than conventional conceptual graphs for individual sentences because only syntactic commonalities are represented at semantic level.

TANENBAUM|publisher=PRENTICE HALL|year=|isbn=0-13-212695-8|location=|pages=131–132|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It displays the signal as a two-dimensional [[Cartesian plane|''xy''-plane]] [[scatter diagram]] in the [[complex plane]] at [[Symbol (data)|symbol]] sampling instants.  The angle of a point, measured counterclockwise from the horizontal axis, represents the [[phase shift]] of the carrier wave from a reference phase.  The distance of a point from the origin represents a measure of the [[amplitude]] or power of the signal.  

In a [[digital modulation]] system, information is transmitted as a series of [[sampling (signal processing)|samples]], each occupying a uniform time slot.  During each sample the carrier wave has a constant [[amplitude]] and [[phase (waves)|phase]] which is restricted to one of a finite number of values, so each sample encodes one of a finite number of "symbols", which in turn represent one or more [[binary digit]]s (bits) of information.  Each symbol is encoded as a different combination of amplitude and phase of the carrier, so each symbol is represented by a point on the constellation diagram, called a ''constellation point''.  The constellation diagram shows all the possible symbols that can be transmitted by the system as a collection of points.  In a [[frequency modulation|frequency]] or [[phase modulation|phase modulated]] signal, the signal amplitude is constant, so the points lie on a circle around the origin.    

The carrier representing each symbol can be created by adding together different amounts of a [[cosine]] wave representing the "I" or ''in-phase'' carrier, and a  [[sine]] wave, shifted by 90° from the I carrier called the "Q" or ''quadrature'' carrier.  Thus each symbol can be represented by a [[complex number]], and the constellation diagram can be regarded as a [[complex plane]], with the horizontal real [[coordinate axis|axis]] representing the I component and the vertical [[imaginary number|imaginary]] [[coordinate axis|axis]] representing the Q component. A [[coherent detector]] is able to independently demodulate these carriers. This principle of using two independently modulated carriers is the foundation of [[quadrature modulation]]. In pure [[Phase-shift keying|phase modulation]], the phase of the modulating symbol is the phase of the carrier itself and this is the best representation of the modulated signal.

A 'signal space diagram' is an ideal constellation diagram showing the correct position of the point representing each symbol.  After passing through a [[communication channel]], due to [[electronic noise]] or [[distortion]]  added to the signal the amplitude and phase received by the demodulator may differ from the correct value for the symbol.  When plotted on a constellation diagram the point representing that received sample will be offset from the correct position for that symbol.   An [[electronic test instrument]] called a [[vector signal analyzer]] can display the constellation diagram of a digital signal by sampling the signal and plotting each received symbol as a point.  The result is a 'ball' or 'cloud' of points surrounding each symbol position.  Measured constellation diagrams can be used to recognize the type of interference and distortion in a signal.

==Interpretation==
[[Image:16QAM Gray Coded.svg|200px|thumb|right|A constellation diagram for rectangular 16-[[Quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]].]]

The number of constellation points in a diagram gives the size of the "alphabet" of symbols that can be transmitted by each sample, and so determines the number of bits transmitted per sample.  It is usually a power of 2.   A diagram with four points, for example, represents a modulation scheme that can separately encode all 4 combinations of two bits: 00, 01, 10, and 11 and so can transmit two bits per sample.  Thus in general a modulation with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; constellation points transmits &lt;math&gt;\log_2 N&lt;/math&gt; bits per sample.     

After passing through the communication channel the signal is decoded by a [[demodulator]].  The function of the demodulator is to classify each sample as a symbol.  The set of sample values which the demodulator classifies as a given symbol can be represented by a region in the plane drawn around each constellation point.  If noise causes the point representing a sample to stray into the region representing another symbol, the demodulator will misidentify that sample as the other symbol, resulting in a symbol error.   Most demodulators choose, as its estimate of what was actually transmitted, the constellation point which is closest (in a [[Euclidean distance]] sense) to that of the received sample; this is called [[maximum likelihood]] detection.  On the constellation diagram these detection regions can be easily represented by dividing the plane by lines equidistant from each adjacent pair of points.  

One half the distance between each pair of neighboring points is the amplitude of additive noise or distortion required to cause one of the points to be misidentified as the other, and thus cause a symbol error.  Therefore the further the points are separated from one another, the greater the noise immunity of the modulation.   Practical modulation systems are designed to maximize the minimum noise needed to cause a symbol error; on the constellation diagram this means that the distance between each pair of adjacent points is equal. 

The received signal quality can be analyzed by displaying the constellation diagram of the signal at the receiver on a [[vector signal analyzer]].  Some types of distortion show up as characteristic patterns on the diagram:
* [[Gaussian noise]] causes the samples to land in a random ball about each constellation point
* Non-coherent single frequency interference shows as samples making circles about each constellation point
* [[Phase noise]] shows as constellation points spreading into arcs centered on the origin
* Amplifier compression causes the corner points to move towards the center

A constellation diagram visualises phenomena similar to those an [[eye pattern]] does for one-dimensional signals.  The [[eye pattern]] can be used to see timing [[jitter]] in one dimension of modulation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30766">'''Constructivist epistemology''' is a branch in [[philosophy of science]] maintaining that scientific knowledge is constructed by the scientific community, who seek to measure and construct models of the natural world. [[Natural science]] therefore consists of mental constructs that aim to explain sensory experience and measurements.

According to constructivists, the world is independent of human minds, but knowledge of the world is always a human and social construction.&lt;ref&gt;Crotty, M. 1998. ''The Foundations of Social Science Research: Meaning and Perspective in the Research Process'', Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Constructivism opposes the philosophy of [[Objectivity (philosophy)#Objectivism|objectivism]], embracing the belief that a human can come to know the truth about the natural world not mediated by scientific approximations with different degrees of [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] and [[accuracy]].

According to constructivists there is no single valid methodology in science, but rather a diversity of useful methods.&lt;ref&gt;(Schofield, n.d.) [http://www.ihrcs.ch/?p=92 Critical Theory and Constructivism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222335/http://www.ihrcs.ch/?p=92 |date=2016-03-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
The term originates from [[Constructivism (psychological school)|psychology]], [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|education]], and [[social constructivism]].  The expression "constructivist epistemology" was first used by [[Jean Piaget]], 1967, with plural form in the famous article from the "Encyclopédie de la Pléiade" ''Logique et connaissance scientifique'' or "Logic and Scientific knowledge", an important text for [[epistemology]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} He refers directly to the mathematician [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]] and his ''radical constructivism''.

The terms ''Constructionism'' and ''constructivism'' are often, but should not be, used interchangeably.  Constructionism is an approach to learning that was developed by Papert; the approach was greatly influenced by his work with Piaget, but it is very different. Constructionism involves the creation of a product to show learning.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation. [http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=8751190 Award Abstract #8751190, ''Constructionism: A New Opportunity for Elementary Science Education'']&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[gender]], as well as tables, chairs and atoms are [[social construction|socially constructed]]. [[Marx]] was among the first to suggest such an ambitious expansion of the power of ideas to inform the material realities of people's lives.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==History==
Constructivism stems from a number of philosophies. For instance, early development can be attributed to the thought of Greek philosophers such as [[Heraclitus]] (''Everything flows, nothing stands still''), [[Protagoras]] (''Man is the measure of all things''). Protagoras is clearly represented by Plato and hence the tradition as a relativist. The Pyrrhonist sceptics have also been so interpreted. (Although this is more contentious.){{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Following the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], with the phenomenology and the event, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] gives a decisive contradiction to Cartesians' epistemology that has grown since Descartes despite [[Giambattista Vico]] calling in ''Scienza nuova'' ("New Science") in 1725 that "the norm of the truth is to have made it". The Enlightenment's claim of the universality of [[Reason]] as the only true source of knowledge generated a Romantic reaction involving an emphasis on the separate natures of races, species, sexes and types of human.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

* [[Gaston Bachelard]], who is known for his physics psychoanalysis and the definition of an "epistemologic obstacle" that can disturb a changing of scientific paradigm as the one that occurred between classical mechanics and Einstein's relativism, opens the teleological way with "The meditation on the object takes the form of the project". In the following famous saying, he insists that the ways in which questions are posed determines the trajectory of scientific movement, before summarizing "nothing is given, all is constructed" : "And, irrespective of what one might assume, in the life of a science, problems do not arise by themselves. It is precisely this that marks out a problem as being of the true scientific spirit: all knowledge is in response to a question. If there  were no question, there would be no scientific knowledge. Nothing proceeds from itself. Nothing is given. All is constructed.", Gaston Bachelard (''La formation de l'esprit scientifique'', 1934). While quantum mechanics is starting to grow, Gaston Bachelard makes a call for a new science in ''Le nouvel esprit scientifique'' (The New Scientific Spirit).
* [[Paul Valéry]], French poet (20th century) reminds us of the importance of representations and action: "We have always sought explanations when it was only representations that we could seek to invent", "My hand feels touched as well as it touches; reality says this, and nothing more".
* This link with action, which could be called a "philosophy of action", was well represented by Spanish poet [[Antonio Machado]]: ''Caminante, no hay camino, se hace camino al andar''.
* [[Ludwik Fleck]] establishes scientific constructivism by introducing the notions of ''thought collective'' (''Denkkollektiv''), and ''thought style'' (''Denkstil''), through which the evolution of science is much more understandable, because the research objects can be described in terms of the assumptions (thought style) that are shared for practical but also inherently social reasons, or just because any thought collective tends to preserve itself. These notions have been drawn upon by [[Thomas Kuhn]].

* [[Jean Piaget]], after the creation in 1955 of the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva, first uses the expression "constructivist epistemologies" (see above). According to [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]], Jean Piaget is "the great pioneer of the constructivist theory of knowing" (in ''An Exposition of Constructivism: Why Some Like it Radical'', 1990) and "the most prolific constructivist in our century" (in ''Aspects of Radical Constructivism'', 1996).
* [[J. L. Austin]] is associated with the view that [[speech]] is not only passively describing a given reality, but it can change the (social) reality to which it is applied through [[speech act]]s.
* [[Herbert A. Simon]] called "the sciences of the artificial" these new sciences (cybernetics, cognitive sciences, decision and organisation sciences) that, because of the abstraction of their object (information, communication, decision), cannot match with the classical epistemology and its experimental method and refutability.

==Constructivism and sciences==
===Social constructivism in sociology===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[International relations]] --&gt;
{{Main|Social constructivism}}
One version of ''social constructivism'' contends that categories of knowledge and reality are actively created by social relationships and interactions. These interactions also alter the way in which scientific episteme is organized.

Social activity presupposes human beings inhabiting shared forms of life, and in the case of social construction, utilizing [[semiotic]] resources ([[meaning-making]] and signifying) with reference to social structures and institutions. Several traditions use the term ''Social Constructivism'': [[psychology]] (after [[Lev Vygotsky]]), [[sociology]] (after  [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]], themselves influenced by [[Alfred Schütz]]), [[sociology of knowledge]] ([[David Bloor]]), [[sociology]] of [[mathematics]] ([[Sal Restivo]]), [[philosophy of mathematics]] ([[Paul Ernest]]). [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy can be seen as a foundation for ''social constructivism'', with its key theoretical concepts of ''language games'' embedded in ''forms of life''.

===Constructivism in philosophy of science===
[[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that changes in scientists' views of reality not only contain subjective elements, but result from group dynamics, "revolutions" in scientific practice and changes in [[Paradigm shift|"paradigms"]].&lt;ref name=Kuhn2&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions |url=http://turkpsikiyatri.org/arsiv/kuhn-ssr-2nded.pdf |author=Thomas S Kuhn |year=1966 |isbn=0226458121 |edition=2nd&lt;!--the 2nd edition is "enlarged" from the 1st, by addition of a postscript--&gt; |publisher=University of Chicago Press |quote=A paradigm governs, in the first instance, not a subject matter but rather a group of practitioners. Any study ... must begin by locating the responsible group or groups. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328173641/http://turkpsikiyatri.org/arsiv/kuhn-ssr-2nded.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-28 |df= }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, Kuhn suggested that the Sun-centric [[Copernican Revolution|Copernican "revolution"]] replaced the Earth-centric views of Ptolemy not because of empirical failures, but because of a new "paradigm" that exerted control over what scientists felt to be the more fruitful way to pursue their goals.
{{quote|"But paradigm debates are not really about relative problem-solving ability, though for good reasons they are usually couched in those terms. Instead, the issue is which paradigm should in future guide research on problems many of which neither competitor can yet claim to resolve completely. A decision between alternate ways of practicing science is called for, and in the circumstances that decision must be based less on past achievement than on future promise. ... A decision of that kind can only be made on faith."|Thomas Kuhn|''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', pp 157-8}}

The view of reality as accessible only through models was called [[model-dependent realism]] by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Leonard Mlodinow]].&lt;ref name=Koonin&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Logic of Chance: The Nature and Origin of Biological Evolution |author=Eugene V. Koonin |publisher=FT Press Science, a division of Pearson Education, Inc |isbn=013262317X |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvmv2kU6PrYC&amp;pg=PA427|page=427}}
&lt;/ref&gt; While not rejecting an independent reality, model-dependent  realism says that we can know only an approximation of it provided by the intermediary of models.&lt;ref name=Mlodinow&gt;
{{Cite book |quote=We shall adopt an approach that we call model-dependent realism. It is based on the idea that our brains interpret the input from our sensory organs by making a model of the world. When such a model is successful at explaining events, we tend to attribute to it, and to the elements and concepts that constitute it, the quality of reality or absolute truth. But there may be different ways in which one could model the same physical situation, with each employing different fundamental elements and concepts. If two such ...theories or models accurately predict the same events, one cannot be said to be more real than the other; rather we are free to use whichever model is the most convenient. |title=The Grand Design |author=Stephen Hawking, Leonard Mlodinow |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoO9jkV-yzIC&amp;pg=PA8 |isbn=0553907077 |page=8 |year=2011 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
These models evolve over time as guided by scientific inspiration and experiment.

In the field of the social sciences, constructivism as an epistemology urges that researchers reflect upon the paradigms that may be underpinning their research, and in the light of this that they become more open to consider other ways of interpreting any results of the research. Furthermore, the focus is on presenting results as negotiable constructs rather than as models that aim to "represent" social realities more or less accurately. Norma Romm in her book Accountability in Social Research (2001) argues that social researchers can earn trust from participants and wider audiences insofar as they adopt this orientation and invite inputs from others regarding their inquiry practices and the results thereof.

===Constructivism and psychology===
{{Main|Constructivism (psychological school)}}
In [[psychology]], constructivism refers to many schools of thought that, though extraordinarily different in their techniques (applied in fields such as [[education]] and [[psychotherapy]]), are all connected by a common critique of previous standard approaches, and by shared assumptions about the active constructive nature of human knowledge. In particular, the critique is aimed at the "associationist" postulate of empiricism, "by which the mind is conceived as a passive system that gathers its contents from its environment and, through the act of knowing, produces a copy of the order of reality."&lt;ref name="Balbi"&gt;{{cite web |last=Balbi |first=Juan |date=2008 |title=Epistemological and theoretical foundations of constructivist cognitive therapies: post-rationalist developments |journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=15–27 |url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A08-01-6.pdf |accessdate=2010-10-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708205138/http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A08-01-6.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}

In contrast, "constructivism is an epistemological premise grounded on the assertion that, in the act of knowing, it is the human mind that actively gives meaning and order to that reality to which it is responding".&lt;ref name="Balbi"/&gt;{{rp|16}}
The constructivist psychologies theorize about and investigate how human beings create systems for meaningfully understanding their worlds and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Raskin |first=Jonathan D. |date=Spring 2002 |title=Constructivism in psychology: personal construct psychology, radical constructivism, and social constructionism |journal=American Communication Journal |volume=5 |issue=3 |url=http://ac-journal.org/journal/vol5/iss3/special/raskin.pdf |accessdate=2009-02-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20090209035603/http://ac-journal.org/journal/vol5/iss3/special/raskin.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructivism and education===
{{Main|Constructivism (philosophy of education)}}

[[Joe L. Kincheloe]] has published numerous social and educational books on critical constructivism (2001, 2005, 2008), a version of constructivist epistemology that places emphasis on the exaggerated influence of political and cultural power in the construction of knowledge, consciousness, and views of reality. In the contemporary mediated electronic era, Kincheloe argues, dominant modes of power have never exerted such influence on human affairs. Coming from a [[critical pedagogy|critical pedagogical]] perspective, Kincheloe argues that understanding a critical constructivist epistemology is central to becoming an educated person and to the institution of just social change.

Kincheloe's characteristics of critical constructivism:

*Knowledge is socially constructed: World and information co-construct one another
*Consciousness is a social construction
*Political struggles: Power plays an exaggerated role in the production of knowledge and consciousness
*The necessity of understanding consciousness—even though it does not lend itself to traditional reductionistic modes of measurability
*The importance of uniting logic and emotion in the process of knowledge and producing knowledge
*The inseparability of the knower and the known
*The centrality of the perspectives of oppressed peoples—the value of the insights of those who have suffered as the result of existing social arrangements
*The existence of multiple realities: Making sense of a world far more complex that we originally imagined
*Becoming humble knowledge workers: Understanding our location in the tangled web of reality
*Standpoint epistemology: Locating ourselves in the web of reality, we are better equipped to produce our own knowledges
*Constructing practical knowledge for critical social action
*Complexity: Overcoming reductionism
*Knowledge is always entrenched in a larger process
*The centrality of interpretation: Critical hermeneutics
*The new frontier of classroom knowledge: Personal experiences intersecting with pluriversal information
*Constructing new ways of being human: Critical ontology

===Constructivism and postmodernism===
For some{{who?|date=October 2017}} [[social constructionism]] has been described as a source of the [[postmodern movement]], and has been influential in the field of cultural studies. Some have gone so far as to attribute the rise of cultural studies (the cultural turn) to [[social constructionism]].

From a realist's point of view, both [[postmodernism]] and constructivism can be interpreted as [[relativism|relativist]] theories.

==Constructivist trends==

===Cultural constructivism===
Cultural constructivism asserts that knowledge and reality are a product of their cultural context, meaning that two independent cultures will likely form different observational methodologies.

===Radical constructivism===
{{See also|Francisco Varela|Humberto Maturana|Heinz von Foerster}}
[[Ernst von Glasersfeld]] was a prominent proponent of radical constructivism. This claims that knowledge is not a commodity which is transported from one mind into another. Rather, it is up to the individual to "link up" specific interpretations of experiences and ideas with their own reference of what is possible and viable. That is, the process of constructing knowledge, of understanding, is dependent on the individual's subjective interpretation of their active experience, not what "actually" occurs. Understanding and acting are seen by radical constructivists not as dualistic processes, but "circularly conjoined".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalconstructivism.com|title=Radical Constructivism|author=|date=|website=www.radicalconstructivism.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419043612/http://radicalconstructivism.com/|archivedate=19 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Constructivist Foundations]]'' is a free online journal publishing peer reviewed articles on radical constructivism by researchers from multiple domains.

===Relational constructivism===
{{main|Relational constructivism}}
[[Relational constructivism]] can be perceived as a relational consequence of the radical constructivism. In contrary to social constructivism, it picks up the epistemological threads and maintains the radical constructivist idea that humans cannot overcome their limited conditions of reception (i.e. ''self referentially operating cognition''). Therefore, humans are not able to come to objective conclusions about the world.

In spite of the subjectivity of human constructions of reality, relational constructivism focusses on the relational conditions applying to human perceptional processes. [[Björn Kraus]] puts it in a nutshell:

{{Zitat|„It is substantial for relational constructivism that it basically originates from an epistemological point of view, thus from the subject and its construction processes. Coming from this perspective it then focusses on the (not only social, but also material) relations under which these cognitive construction processes are performed. Consequently, it‘s not only about social construction processes, but about cognitive construction processes performed under certain relational conditions.“&lt;ref&gt;Björn Kraus: Plädoyer für den Relationalen Konstruktivismus und eine Relationale Soziale Arbeit. in Forum Sozial (2017) 1 pp. 29-35, {{cite web |url=http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/51948 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015044520/http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/51948 |archivedate=2017-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Critical constructivism===
A series of articles published in the journal ''Critical Inquiry'' (1991) served as a manifesto for the movement of critical constructivism in various disciplines, including the [[natural science]]s.   Not only truth and reality, but also "[[evidence]]", "[[document]]", "[[experience]]", "[[fact]]", "proof", and other central categories of empirical research (in [[physics]], [[biology]], [[statistics]], [[history]], [[law]], etc.) reveal their contingent character as a social and ideological construction. Thus, a "realist" or "rationalist" interpretation is subjected to criticism.  Kincheloe's political and pedagogical notion (above) has emerged as a central articulation of the concept.

While recognizing the constructedness of reality, many representatives of this critical paradigm deny philosophy the task of the creative construction of reality.  They eagerly criticize realistic judgments, but they do not move beyond analytic procedures based on subtle [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]].  They thus remain in the critical paradigm and consider it to be a standard of scientific philosophy per se.

===Genetic epistemology===
{{main|Genetic epistemology}}
[[James Mark Baldwin]] invented this expression, which was later popularized by [[Jean Piaget]]. From 1955 to 1980, Piaget was Director of the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva.

==Criticisms==
Numerous criticisms have been leveled at Constructivist epistemology. The most common one is that it either explicitly advocates or implicitly reduces to [[relativism]]. This is because it takes the concept of truth to be a socially "constructed" (and thereby socially relative) one. This leads to the charge of [[Self-refuting idea|self-refutation]]: if what is to be regarded as "true" is relative to a particular social formation, then this very conception of [[truth]] must itself be only regarded as being "true" in this society. In another social formation, it may well be false. If so, then social constructivism itself would be false in that social formation. Further, one could then say that social constructivism could be both true and false simultaneously.

Another criticism of constructivism is that it holds that the concepts of two different social formations be entirely different and incommensurate. This being the case, it is impossible to make comparative judgements about statements made according to each worldview. This is because the criteria of judgement will themselves have to be based on some worldview or other. If this is the case, then it brings into question how communication between them about the truth or falsity of any given statement could be established.

Social Constructivists{{Who|date=July 2009}} often argue that constructivism is liberating because it either (1) enables oppressed groups to reconstruct "the World" in accordance with their own interests rather than according to the interests of dominant groups in society, or (2) compels people to respect the alternative worldviews of oppressed groups because there is no way of judging them to be inferior to dominant worldviews. As the [[Wittgenstein]]ian philosopher [[Gavin Kitching]]&lt;ref&gt;Kitching, G. 2008. ''The Trouble with Theory: The Educational Costs of Postmodernism''. Penn State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; argues, however, constructivists usually implicitly presuppose a [[deterministic]] view of language which severely constrains the minds and use of words by members of societies: they are not just "constructed" by language on this view, but are literally "determined" by it. Kitching notes the contradiction here: somehow the advocate of constructivism is not similarly constrained. While other individuals are controlled by the dominant concepts of society, the advocate of constructivism can transcend these concepts and see through them.

In [[computer science]], '''corecursion''' is a type of operation that is [[Dual (category theory)|dual]] to [[recursion (computer science)|recursion]]. Whereas recursion works analytically, starting on data further from a base case and breaking it down into smaller data and repeating until one reaches a base case, corecursion works synthetically, starting from a base case and building it up, iteratively producing data further removed from a base case. Put simply, corecursive algorithms use the data that they themselves produce, bit by bit, as they become available, and needed, to produce further bits of data. A similar but distinct concept is ''[[Generative_recursion#Structural_versus_generative_recursion|generative recursion]]'' which may lack a definite "direction" inherent in corecursion and recursion.

Where recursion allows programs to operate on arbitrarily complex data, so long as they can be reduced to simple data (base cases), corecursion allows programs to produce arbitrarily complex and potentially infinite data structures, such as [[stream (computing)|stream]]s, so long as it can be produced from simple data (base cases) in a sequence of ''finite'' steps. Where recursion may not terminate, never reaching a base state, corecursion starts from a base state, and thus produces subsequent steps deterministically, though it may proceed indefinitely (and thus not terminate under strict evaluation), or it may consume more than it produces and thus become non-''productive''. Many functions that are traditionally analyzed as recursive can alternatively, and arguably more naturally, be interpreted as corecursive functions that are terminated at a given stage, for example [[recurrence relation]]s such as the factorial.

Corecursion can produce both [[Finite set|finite]] and [[Infinite set|infinite]] [[data structure]]s as results, and may employ [[self-reference|self-referential]] data structures. Corecursion is often used in conjunction with [[lazy evaluation]], to produce only a finite subset of a potentially infinite structure (rather than trying to produce an entire infinite structure at once). Corecursion is a particularly important concept in [[functional programming]], where corecursion and [[codata (computer science)|codata]] allow [[total language]]s to work with infinite data structures.

== Examples ==
Corecursion can be understood by contrast with recursion, which is more familiar. While corecursion is primarily of interest in functional programming, it can be illustrated using imperative programming, which is done below using the [[Generator (computer programming)|generator]] facility in Python. In these examples local variables are used, and [[Assignment (computer science)|assigned values]] imperatively (destructively), though these are not necessary in corecursion in pure functional programming. In pure functional programming, rather than assigning to local variables, these computed values form an invariable sequence, and prior values are accessed by self-reference (later values in the sequence reference earlier values in the sequence to be computed). The assignments simply express this in the imperative paradigm and explicitly specify where the computations happen, which serves to clarify the exposition.

=== Factorial ===
A classic example of recursion is computing the [[factorial]], which is defined recursively by ''0! := 1'' and ''n! := n × (n - 1)!''.

To ''recursively'' compute its result on a given input, a recursive function calls (a copy of) ''itself'' with a different ("smaller" in some way) input and uses the result of this call to construct its result. The recursive call does the same, unless the ''base case'' has been reached. Thus a [[call stack]] develops in the process. For example, to compute ''fac(3)'', this recursively calls in turn ''fac(2)'', ''fac(1)'', ''fac(0)'' ("winding up" the stack), at which point recursion terminates with ''fac(0) = 1'', and then the stack unwinds in reverse order and the results are calculated on the way back along the call stack to the initial call frame ''fac(3)'' that uses the result of ''fac(2) = 2'' to calculate the final result as ''3 × 2 = 3 × fac(2) =: fac(3)'' and finally return ''fac(3) = 6''. In this example a function returns a single value.

This stack unwinding can be explicated, defining the factorial ''corecursively'', as an [[Iteration|iterator]], where one ''starts'' with the case of &lt;math&gt;1 =: 0!&lt;/math&gt;, then from this starting value constructs factorial values for increasing numbers ''1, 2, 3...'' as in the above recursive definition with "time arrow" reversed, as it were, by reading it ''backwards'' as {{nobreak|&lt;math&gt;n! \times (n+1) =: (n+1)!&lt;/math&gt;.}} The corecursive algorithm thus defined produces a ''stream'' of ''all'' factorials. This may be concretely implemented as a [[Generator (computer programming)|generator]]. Symbolically, noting that computing next factorial value requires keeping track of both ''n'' and ''f'' (a previous factorial value), this can be represented as:
:&lt;math&gt;n, f = (0, 1) : (n + 1, f \times (n+1))&lt;/math&gt;
or in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], 
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
  (\(n,f) -&gt; (n+1, f*(n+1))) `iterate` (0,1)
&lt;/source&gt;
meaning, "starting from &lt;math&gt;n, f = 0, 1&lt;/math&gt;, on each step the next values are calculated as &lt;math&gt;n+1, f \times (n+1)&lt;/math&gt;". This is mathematically equivalent and almost identical to the recursive definition, but the &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; emphasizes that the factorial values are being built ''up'', going forwards from the starting case, rather than being computed after first going backwards, ''down'' to the base case, with a &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; decrement. Note also that the direct output of the corecursive function does not simply contain the factorial &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt; values, but also includes for each value the auxiliary data of its index ''n'' in the sequence, so that any one specific result can be selected among them all, as and when needed.

Note the connection with [[denotational semantics]], where the [[Denotational semantics#Denotations of recursive programs|denotations of recursive programs]] is built up corecursively in this way.

In Python, a recursive factorial function can be defined as:{{efn|Not validating input data.}}
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
This could then be called for example as &lt;code&gt;factorial(5)&lt;/code&gt; to compute ''5!''.

A corresponding corecursive generator can be defined as:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def factorials():
    n, f = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield f
        n, f = n + 1, f * (n + 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
This generates an infinite stream of factorials in order; a finite portion of it can be produced by:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def n_factorials(k):
    n, f = 0, 1
    while n &lt;= k:
        yield f
        n, f = n + 1, f * (n + 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
This could then be called to produce the factorials up to ''5!'' via:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
for f in n_factorials(5):
    print(f)
&lt;/source&gt;
If we're only interested in a certain factorial, just the last value can be taken, or we can fuse the production and the access into one function,
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def nth_factorial(k):
    n, f = 0, 1
    while n &lt; k:
        n, f = n + 1, f * (n + 1)
    yield f
&lt;/source&gt;
As can be readily seen here, this is practically equivalent (just by substituting &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; for the only &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; there) to the accumulator argument technique for [[tail call|tail recursion]], unwound into an explicit loop. Thus it can be said that the concept of corecursion is an explication of the embodiment of iterative computation processes by recursive definitions, where applicable.

=== Fibonacci sequence ===
In the same way, the [[Fibonacci sequence]] can be represented as:
:&lt;math&gt;a, b = (0, 1) : (b, a+b)&lt;/math&gt;
Note that because the Fibonacci sequence is a [[recurrence relation]] of order 2, the corecursive relation must track two successive terms, with the &lt;math&gt;(b, -)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to shift forward by one step, and the &lt;math&gt;(-, a+b)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to computing the next term. This can then be implemented as follows (using [[parallel assignment]]):
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def fibonacci_sequence():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b
&lt;/source&gt;
In Haskell, &lt;source lang=haskell&gt; map fst ( (\(a,b) -&gt; (b,a+b)) `iterate` (0,1) )&lt;/source&gt;

=== Tree traversal ===
[[Tree traversal]] via a [[depth-first]] approach is a classic example of recursion. Dually, [[breadth-first]] traversal can very naturally be implemented via corecursion.

Without using recursion or corecursion specifically, one may traverse a tree by starting at the root node, placing its child nodes in a data structure, then iterating by removing node after node from the data structure while placing each removed node's children back into that data structure.{{efn|More elegantly, one can start by placing the root node itself in the data structure and then starting the process.}} If the data structure is a [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]] (LIFO), this yields depth-first traversal, and  if the data structure is a [[Queue (abstract data type)|queue]] (FIFO), this yields breadth-first traversal.

Using recursion, a (post-order){{efn|Post-order is to make "leaf node is base case" explicit for exposition, but the same analysis works for pre-order or in-order.}} depth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node and recursively traversing each child subtree in turn (the subtree based at each child node) – the second child subtree does not start processing until the first child subtree is finished. Once a leaf node is reached or the children of a branch node have been exhausted, the node itself is visited (e.g., the value of the node itself is outputted). In this case, the call stack (of the recursive functions) acts as the stack that is iterated over.

Using corecursion, a breadth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node, outputting its value,{{efn|Breadth-first traversal, unlike depth-first, is unambiguous, and visits a node value before processing children.}} then breadth-first traversing the subtrees – i.e., passing on the ''whole list'' of subtrees to the next step (not a single subtree, as in the recursive approach) – at the next step outputting the value of all of their root nodes, then passing on their child subtrees, etc.{{efn|Technically, one may define a breadth-first traversal on an ordered, disconnected set of trees – first the root node of each tree, then the children of each tree in turn, then the grandchildren in turn, etc.}} In this case the generator function, indeed the output sequence itself, acts as the queue. As in the factorial example (above), where the auxiliary information of the index (which step one was at, ''n'') was pushed forward, in addition to the actual output of ''n''!, in this case the auxiliary information of the remaining subtrees is pushed forward, in addition to the actual output. Symbolically:
:&lt;math&gt;v, t = ([], FullTree) : (RootValues, ChildTrees)&lt;/math&gt;
meaning that at each step, one outputs the list of values of root nodes, then proceeds to the child subtrees. Generating just the node values from this sequence simply requires discarding the auxiliary child tree data, then flattening the list of lists (values are initially grouped by level (depth); flattening (ungrouping) yields a flat linear list). In Haskell, 
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt; concatMap fst ( (\(v, t) -&gt; (rootValues t, childTrees t)) `iterate` ([], fullTree) )&lt;/source&gt;

These can be compared as follows. The recursive traversal handles a ''leaf node'' (at the ''bottom'') as the base case (when there are no children, just output the value), and ''analyzes'' a tree into subtrees, traversing each in turn, eventually resulting in just leaf nodes – actual leaf nodes, and branch nodes whose children have already been dealt with (cut off ''below''). By contrast, the corecursive traversal handles a ''root node'' (at the ''top'') as the base case (given a node, first output the value), treats a tree as being ''synthesized'' of a root node and its children, then produces as auxiliary output a list of subtrees at each step, which are then the input for the next step – the child nodes of the original root are the root nodes at the next step, as their parents have already been dealt with (cut off ''above''). Note also that in the recursive traversal there is a distinction between leaf nodes and branch nodes, while in the corecursive traversal there is no distinction, as each node is treated as the root node of the subtree it defines.

Notably, given an infinite tree,{{efn|Assume fixed [[branching factor]] (e.g., binary), or at least bounded, and balanced (infinite in every direction).}} the corecursive breadth-first traversal will traverse all nodes, just as for a finite tree, while the recursive depth-first traversal will go down one branch and not traverse all nodes, and indeed if traversing post-order, as in this example (or in-order), it will visit no nodes at all, because it never reaches a leaf. This shows the usefulness of corecursion rather than recursion for dealing with infinite data structures.

In Python, this can be implemented as follows.{{efn|First defining a tree class, say via:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
class Tree:
    def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left  = left
        self.right = right

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value)
&lt;/source&gt;
and initializing a tree, say via:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
t = Tree(1, Tree(2, Tree(4), Tree(5)), Tree(3, Tree(6), Tree(7)))
&lt;/source&gt;
In this example nodes are labeled in breadth-first order:
     1
  2     3
 4 5   6 7
}}
The usual post-order depth-first traversal can be defined as:{{efn|Intuitively, the function iterates over subtrees (possibly empty), then once these are finished, all that is left is the node itself, whose value is then returned; this corresponds to treating a leaf node as basic.}}
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def df(node):
    if node is not None:
        df(node.left)
        df(node.right)
        print(node.value)
&lt;/source&gt;
This can then be called by &lt;code&gt;df(t)&lt;/code&gt; to print the values of the nodes of the tree in post-order depth-first order.

The breadth-first corecursive generator can be defined as:{{efn|1=Here the argument (and loop variable) is considered as a whole, possible infinite tree, represented by (identified with) its root node (tree = root node), rather than as a potential leaf node, hence the choice of variable name.}}
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
def bf(tree):
    tree_list = [tree]
    while tree_list:
        new_tree_list = []
        for tree in tree_list:
            if tree is not None:
                yield tree.value
                new_tree_list.append(tree.left)
                new_tree_list.append(tree.right)
        tree_list = new_tree_list
&lt;/source&gt;
This can then be called to print the values of the nodes of the tree in breadth-first order:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
for i in bf(t):
    print(i)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Definition==
{{technical|section|date=November 2010}}
[[Initial and terminal objects|Initial data type]]s can be defined as being the [[least fixpoint]] ([[up to isomorphism]]) of some type equation; the [[isomorphism]] is then given by an [[Initial algebra|initial]] [[F-algebra|algebra]]. Dually, final (or terminal) data types can be defined as being the [[greatest fixpoint]] of a type equation; the isomorphism is then given by a final [[F-coalgebra|coalgebra]].

If the domain of discourse is the [[category of sets]] and total functions, then final data types may contain infinite, [[Non-well-founded set theory|non-wellfounded]] values, whereas initial types do not.&lt;ref&gt;Barwise and Moss 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moss and Danner 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, if the domain of discourse is the category of [[complete partial order]]s and [[Scott continuity|continuous functions]], which corresponds roughly to the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] programming language, then final types coincide with initial types, and the corresponding final coalgebra and initial algebra form an isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth and Plotkin 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corecursion is then a technique for recursively defining functions whose range (codomain) is a final data type, dual to the way that ordinary [[recursion]] recursively defines functions whose domain is an initial data type.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons and Hutton 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--G&amp;H ascribe this definition to Barwise and Moss--&gt;

The discussion below provides several examples in Haskell that distinguish corecursion. Roughly speaking, if one were to port these definitions to the category of sets, they would still be corecursive. This informal usage is consistent with existing textbooks about Haskell.&lt;ref&gt;Doets and van Eijck 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Also note that the examples used in this article predate the attempts to define corecursion and explain what it is.

==Discussion==
{{cleanup|section|reason=mix of discussion, examples, and related concepts|date=July 2012}}
{{Expert needed|Computer science|2=section|date=November 2010}}
The rule for ''primitive corecursion'' on [[codata (computer science)|codata]] is the dual to that for [[primitive recursion]] on data. Instead of descending on the argument by [[pattern-matching]] on its constructors (that ''were called up before'', somewhere, so we receive a ready-made datum and get at its constituent sub-parts, i.e. "fields"), we ascend on the result by filling-in its "destructors" (or "observers", that ''will be called afterwards'', somewhere - so we're actually calling a constructor, creating another bit of the result to be observed later on). Thus corecursion ''creates'' (potentially infinite) codata, whereas ordinary recursion ''analyses'' (necessarily finite) data.  Ordinary recursion might not be applicable to the codata because it might not terminate.  Conversely, corecursion is not strictly necessary if the result type is data, because data must be finite.

In "Programming with streams in Coq: a case study: the Sieve of Eratosthenes"&lt;ref&gt;Leclerc and Paulin-Mohring, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; we find
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
hd (conc a s) = a               
tl (conc a s) = s

(sieve p s) = if div p (hd s) then sieve p (tl s)
              else conc (hd s) (sieve p (tl s))

hd (primes s) = (hd s)          
tl (primes s) = primes (sieve (hd s) (tl s))
&lt;/source&gt;
where primes "are obtained by applying the primes operation to the stream (Enu 2)". Following the above notation, the sequence of primes (with a throwaway 0 prefixed to it) and numbers streams being progressively sieved, can be represented as 
:&lt;math&gt;p, s = (0, [2..]) : (hd(s), sieve(hd(s),tl(s)))&lt;/math&gt;
or in Haskell, 
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
(\(p, s@(h:t)) -&gt; (h, sieve h t)) `iterate` (0, [2..])
&lt;/source&gt;
The authors discuss how the definition of &lt;code&gt;sieve&lt;/code&gt; is not guaranteed always to be ''productive'', and could become stuck e.g. if called with &lt;code&gt;[5,10..]&lt;/code&gt; as the initial stream.

Here is another example in Haskell. The following definition produces the list of [[Fibonacci numbers]] in linear time:
&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
&lt;/source&gt;

This infinite list depends on lazy evaluation;  elements are computed on an as-needed basis, and only finite prefixes are ever explicitly represented in memory. This feature allows algorithms on parts of codata to terminate; such techniques are an important part of Haskell programming.

This can be done in Python as well:&lt;ref&gt;Hettinger 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
from itertools import tee, chain, islice, imap

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def fibonacci():
    def deferred_output():
        for i in output:
            yield i
    result, c1, c2 = tee(deferred_output(), 3)
    paired = imap(add, c1, islice(c2, 1, None))
    output = chain([0, 1], paired)
    return result

for i in islice(fibonacci(), 20):
    print(i)
&lt;/source&gt;

The definition of &lt;code&gt;zipWith&lt;/code&gt; can be inlined, leading to this:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
fibs = 0 : 1 : next fibs
  where
    next (a: t@(b:_)) = (a+b):next t
&lt;/source&gt;

This example employs a self-referential ''data structure''.   Ordinary recursion makes use of self-referential ''functions'',   but does not accommodate self-referential data.   However,  this is not essential to the Fibonacci example.    It can be rewritten as follows:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
fibs = fibgen (0,1)
fibgen (x,y) = x : fibgen (y,x+y) 
&lt;/source&gt;

This employs only self-referential ''function'' to construct the result. If it were used with strict list constructor it would be an example of runaway recursion, but with [[lazy evaluation|non-strict]] list constructor this guarded recursion gradually produces an indefinitely defined list.

{{anchor|corecursive queue breadth-first tree traversal}}Corecursion need not produce an infinite object; a corecursive queue&lt;ref&gt;Allison 1989; Smith 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; is a particularly good example of this phenomenon.   The following definition produces a [[Breadth-first search|breadth-first traversal]] of a binary tree in linear time:

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
data Tree a b = Leaf a  |  Branch b (Tree a b) (Tree a b)

bftrav :: Tree a b -&gt; [Tree a b]
bftrav tree = queue
  where
    queue = tree : gen 1 queue

    gen  0   p                 =         []           
    gen len (Leaf   _     : s) =         gen (len-1) s 
    gen len (Branch _ l r : s) = l : r : gen (len+1) s  
&lt;/source&gt;

This definition takes an initial tree and produces a list of subtrees.   This list serves dual purpose as both the queue and the result (&lt;small&gt;''&lt;code&gt;gen len p&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/small&gt; produces its output &lt;small&gt;''&lt;code&gt;len&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/small&gt; notches after its input back-pointer, &lt;small&gt;''&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/small&gt;, along the &lt;small&gt;''&lt;code&gt;queue&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/small&gt;).  It is finite if and only if the initial tree is finite.  The length of the queue must be explicitly tracked in order to ensure termination;  this can safely be elided if this definition is applied only to infinite trees.  &lt;!-- Even if the result is finite, this example depends on lazy evaluation due to the use of self-referential data structures.

why the above was removed: it isn't true: the Haskell code can be translated into Prolog quite straightforwardly. Prolog is not a lazy language. But it does have tail recursion modulo cons. Which is emulatable in Scheme, C, etc.

bftrav(Tree,Q):- Q=[Tree|R], bfgen(1,Q,R).
bfgen(0,_,[]):- !.
bfgen(N,[leaf(_)        |P], R       ):- N2 is N-1, bfgen(N2,P,R).
bfgen(N,[branch(_,Lt,Rt)|P],[Lt,Rt|R]):- N2 is N+1, bfgen(N2,P,R).
--&gt;

Another particularly good example gives a solution to the problem of breadth-first labeling.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Gibbons 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The function &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; visits every node in a binary tree in a breadth first fashion,  and replaces each label with an integer,  each subsequent integer is bigger than the last by one.   This solution employs a self-referential data structure,  and the binary tree can be finite or infinite.

&lt;source lang=haskell&gt;
label :: Tree a b -&gt; Tree Int Int 
label t = t′
    where
    (t′, ns) = go t (1:ns)

    go :: Tree a b    -&gt; [Int]  -&gt; (Tree Int Int, [Int])
    go   (Leaf   _    ) (n:ns) = (Leaf   n       , n+1 : ns  )
    go   (Branch _ l r) (n:ns) = (Branch n l′ r′ , n+1 : ns′′)
                                where
                                  (l′, ns′ ) = go l ns
                                  (r′, ns′′) = go r ns′
&lt;/source&gt;

An [[apomorphism]] (such as an [[anamorphism]], such as [[Unfold (higher-order function)|unfold]]) is a form of corecursion in the same way that a [[paramorphism]] (such as a [[catamorphism]], such as [[Fold (higher-order function)|fold]]) is a form of recursion.

The [[Coq]] proof assistant supports corecursion and [[coinduction]] using the CoFixpoint command.

== History ==
Corecursion, referred to as ''circular programming,'' dates at least to {{Harv|Bird|1984}}, who credits [[John Hughes (computer scientist)|John Hughes]] and [[Philip Wadler]]; more general forms were developed in {{Harv|Allison|1989}}. The original motivations included producing more efficient algorithms (allowing 1 pass over data in some cases, instead of requiring multiple passes) and implementing classical data structures, such as doubly linked lists and queues, in functional languages.

In [[physics]], a '''covariance group''' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] of [[Coordinate system#Transformations|coordinate transformations]] between [[Frame of reference|frames of reference]] (see for example Ryckman (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Ryckman 2005, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;). A frame of reference provides a set of coordinates for an observer moving with that frame to make measurements and define physical quantities. The [[covariance principle]] states the [[laws of physics]] should transform from one frame to another covariantly, that is, according to a [[Group representation|representation]] of the covariance group.

[[Special relativity]] considers observers in [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frames]], and the covariance group consists of [[Rotation group SO(3)|rotations]], [[Lorentz transformation|velocity boosts]], and the [[Parity (physics)|parity transformation]]. It is denoted as [[Generalized orthogonal group|O(1,3)]] and is often referred to as [[Lorentz group]].

For example, the [[Maxwell equation#Covariant formulation of Maxwell.27s equations|Maxwell equation]] with sources,

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu}=4\pi j^\nu\,,&lt;/math&gt;

transforms as a [[four-vector]], that is, under the [[Representations of the Lorentz group#Common reps|(1/2,1/2)]] representation of the O(1,3) group.

The [[Dirac equation#Covariant form and relativistic invariance|Dirac equation]],

:&lt;math&gt;(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu-m)\psi=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

transforms as a [[bispinor]], that is, under the (1/2,0)&amp;oplus;(0,1/2) representation of the O(1,3) group.

The covariance principle, unlike the [[Principle of relativity|relativity principle]], does not imply that the equations are [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under transformations from the covariance group. In practice the equations for [[Electromagnetic force|electromagnetic]] and [[strong interaction|strong]] interactions ''are'' invariant, while the [[weak interaction]] is not invariant under the parity transformation. For example, the Maxwell equation ''is'' invariant, while the corresponding equation for the [[Standard model (basic details)#The Gauge Field Lagrangian|weak field]] explicitly contains [[Standard model (basic details)#The charged and neutral current couplings|left currents]] and thus is not invariant under the parity transformation.

In [[general relativity]] the covariance group consists of all arbitrary ([[invertible]] and [[Differentiable function|differentiable]]) coordinate transformations.

'''Deep ecology''' is an [[ecology|ecological]] and [[environmental philosophy]] promoting the inherent worth of living beings regardless of their instrumental utility to human needs, plus a radical restructuring of modern human societies in accordance with such ideas. 

Deep ecology argues that the natural world is a subtle balance of complex inter-relationships in which the existence of organisms is dependent on the existence of others within [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ecosystems are also considered to be dependent on other ecosystems within the [[biosphere]].&lt;/ref&gt; Human interference with or destruction of the natural world poses a threat therefore not only to humans but to all organisms constituting the natural order.

Deep ecology's core principle is the belief that the living environment as a whole should be respected and regarded as having certain inalienable legal [[rights]] to live and flourish, independent of its instrumental benefits for human use. Deep ecology is often framed in terms of the idea of a much broader sociality; it recognizes diverse communities of life on Earth that are composed not only through biotic factors but also, where applicable, through ethical relations, that is, the valuing of other beings as more than just resources. It describes itself as "deep" because it regards itself as looking more deeply into the actual reality of humanity's relationship with the natural world arriving at philosophically more profound conclusions than that of the prevailing view of ecology as a branch of biology.&lt;ref name="Smith2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Mick |date=2014 |title=Deep Ecology: What is Said and (to be) Done? |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/1378/1660 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=141–156 |issn=0832-6193 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement does not subscribe to [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] environmentalism (which is concerned with conservation of the environment only for exploitation by and for human purposes) since deep ecology is grounded in a quite different set of philosophical assumptions. Deep ecology takes a more [[holistic view]] of the world human beings live in and seeks to apply to life the understanding that the separate parts of the ecosystem (including humans) function as a whole. This philosophy provides a foundation for the [[environmental movement|environmental]], [[ecology movement|ecology]], and [[green movement]]s and has fostered a new system of [[environmental ethics]] advocating [[wilderness]] preservation, [[human population control]], and [[simple living]].&lt;ref name=barry&gt;{{cite book |title=International Encyclopedia of Environmental Politics|author=John Barry|author2=E. Gene Frankland|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|page=161|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTB4OMgsxIEC&amp;pg=PA161|isbn=9780415202855}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Origins ==
In his original 1972/73 deep ecology paper, [[Arne Næss]] claims the deep ecology movement arose from scientists – ecologists – who were out in the field studying the biodiversity and wild ecosystems throughout the world. They were also doing the work of philosophers, laying the foundations for the Age of Ecology and a new ecological worldview to replace the anthropocentric, mastery of Nature, and modernist worldview arising in the 17th and 18th centuries. Three of the most influential ecological spokespersons of the 1960s were [[Rachel Carson]], [[David Brower]], and [[Paul R. Ehrlich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sessions |first=George |date=2014 |title=Deep Ecology, New Conservation, and the Anthropocene Worldview |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/1404/1658 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=106–114 |issn=0832-6193 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider the publication of Rachel Carson's book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) as the beginning of the contemporary, long-range deep ecology movement. When her book appeared there was a long-standing movement for conservation of land and resources, as well as support for creating parks and other areas devoted to preserving wilderness and spectacular nature. Carson's writings were especially influential because they clearly showed how human well-being depends on the condition of whole biotic communities. She explained in practical terms how living beings are interrelated within ecosystems. She explained how pesticides used to control mosquitoes and other insects led to declines in some bird populations. ''Silent Spring'' helped show how complex food webs and networks of biotic relationships function. Since humans are at the top of many food chains, exposure to chemicals becomes more concentrated as these move up the chains. The chemicals also can be stored in human tissues and gradually accumulate over time, adversely affecting health. Carson showed the need for deep changes in human practices and ways of living.

The 1960s was a decade of vigorous social [[activism]] in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Australia. Some activism focused on war and peace and the issue of nuclear weapons. A well-known early environmental organization started with a focus on nuclear tests and their environmental hazards. Some people in British Columbia, Canada, were opposed to the test of a nuclear weapon by the US government on Amchitka Island. They hired a fishing vessel and sailed towards the nuclear test site in protest. This action led to the founding of [[Greenpeace]], which became more identified with environmental issues as time went by. These great movements were further catalyzed by the now iconic images of the whole Earth floating in space taken during the return of the Apollo space missions from their journey to the moon. Among the astronauts that witnessed seeing the whole Earth firsthand was [[Edgar D. Mitchell]], who in 1971, during the return mission of Apollo 14, had an epiphany that what is needed to solve the eco-crisis "is a transformation of consciousness".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Alan |last1=Drengson |first2=Bill |last2=Devall |first3=Mark A. |last3=Schroll |date=2011 |title=The Deep Ecology Movement: Origins, Development, and Future Prospects (Toward a Transpersonal Ecosophy) |journal=International Journal of Transpersonal Studies |volume=30 |issue=1–2 |pages=101–117 |doi=10.24972/ijts.2011.30.1-2.101 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==

Proponents of deep ecology believe that the world does not exist as a [[natural resource|resource]] to be freely [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploited]] by humans. If material goods do not guarantee happiness beyond a very moderate level, and over-consumption is endangering the biosphere, defining a new non-consumptive paradigm of well-being seems primordial, such a paradigm would be non-acquisitive/non-consumerist and non-hierarchical in relation to our place on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Tom|last2=Guyas|first2=Anniina Suominen|title=Earth Education, Interbeing, and Deep Ecology|journal=Studies in Art Education|volume=53|issue=3|year=2015|pages=223–245|issn=0039-3541|doi=10.1080/00393541.2012.11518865}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethics of deep ecology hold that the survival of any part is dependent upon the well-being of the whole. Proponents of deep ecology offer an eight-tier platform to elucidate their claims:

{{quotation|
*The well-being and flourishing of human and nonhuman life on Earth have value in themselves. These values are independent of the usefulness of the nonhuman world for human purposes.
*Richness and [[diversity of life]] forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in themselves
*Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital human needs
*The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease of the [[human population]]. The flourishing of nonhuman life requires such a decrease.
*Present human interference with the nonhuman world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening
*Policies must therefore be changed. These policies affect basic economic, technological, and ideological structures. The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different from the present.
*The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating [[life quality]] (dwelling in situations of inherent value) rather than adhering to an increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the difference between ''big'' and ''great''.
*Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation directly or indirectly to try to implement the necessary changes.

==Development==
The phrase "deep ecology" was coined by the Norwegian philosopher [[Arne Næss]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="Naess1973"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Næss|first1=Arne|title=The shallow and the deep, long‐range ecology movement. A summary|journal=Inquiry|volume=16|issue=1–4|year=1973|pages=95–100|issn=0020-174X|doi=10.1080/00201747308601682|url=http://wildsreprisal.com/PDF's/Cascadia%20Rising/The%20shallow%20and%20the%20deep,%20long-range%20ecology%20movement.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Næss rejected the idea that beings can be ranked according to their relative value. For example, judgments on whether an animal has an eternal [[soul]], whether it uses [[reason]] or whether it has [[consciousness]] (or indeed [[higher consciousness]]) have all been used to justify the ranking of the [[human|human animal]] as superior to other animals. Næss states that from an ecological point of view "the right of all forms [of life] to live is a universal right which cannot be quantified. No single species of living being has more of this particular right to live and unfold than any other species."{{fact|date=November 2018}}

This [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] idea is elucidated in [[Warwick Fox]]'s claim that humanity and all other beings are "aspects of a single unfolding reality".&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Warwick, (1990) ''Towards a Transpersonal Ecology'' (Shambhala Books)&lt;/ref&gt;  As such deep ecology would support the view of [[Aldo Leopold]] in his book  ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' that humans are "plain members of the biotic community". They also would support [[Land ethic#Aldo Leopold's land ethic|Leopold's land ethic]]: "a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability and beauty of the [[biocoenosis|biotic community]]. It is wrong when it tends otherwise."  Daniel Quinn, in his novel ''[[Ishmael (novel)|Ishmael]]'', showed that an anthropocentric myth underlies our current view of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Daniel (1995), "Ishmael: An Adventure of the Mind and Spirit" (Bantam)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecological problems faced by the world today are partly due to the loss of traditional knowledge, values, and ethics of behavior that celebrate the intrinsic value and sacredness of the natural world and that give the preservation of Nature prime importance. Correspondingly, the assumption of human superiority to other life forms, as if we were granted royalty status over Nature - the idea that Nature is mainly here to serve human will and purpose - receives a radical critique in deep ecology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Deep ecology developed a response to the anthropocentric view and several different actors played an important historical role in its development. Prominent among them was [[Joseph W. Meeker]], who in 1973 told [[George Sessions]] about Arne Næss, whom Meeker knew personally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Merle|title=Sustainable development and deep ecology: An analysis of competing traditions|journal=Environmental Management|language=en|volume=18|issue=4|pages=477–488|doi=10.1007/BF02400853|issn=0364-152X|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Warwick Fox related, "One of the things that initially interested Sessions about Næss was Næss's strong interest in, and innovative approach to, the work of Spinoza. Sessions says that he had himself 'arrived at Spinoza as the answer to the process of teaching history of philosophy by about 1972 and independently of being in contact with Næss.'"{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Sessions therefore wrote to Næss at this time, beginning a lifelong association. Meeker's (1972, 1997) book ''The Comedy of Survival: Studies in Literary Ecology'' emerged through the work of scholars seeking an environmental ethic. That book represents Meeker's founding work in literary ecology and [[ecocriticism]], which demonstrates the relationship between the literary arts and scientific ecology, especially humankind's consideration of comedy and tragedy. It reminds readers that adaptive behaviors (comedy) promote survival, whereas tragedy estranges from other life forms. This thesis rests on Meeker's study of comparative literature, his work with biologist [[Konrad Lorenz]], and his work as a field ecologist in the National Park service in Alaska, Oregon, and California.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Deep ecology offers a philosophical basis for environmental advocacy which may, in turn, guide human activity against perceived self-destruction. Deep ecology and [[environmentalism]] hold that the science of ecology [[History of ecology|shows]] that [[ecosystem]]s can absorb only limited change by humans or other dissonant influences. Further, both hold that the actions of modern civilization threaten global ecological well-being. Ecologists have described change and stability in ecological systems in various ways, including [[homeostasis]], [[dynamic equilibrium]], and "flux of nature".&lt;ref&gt;Botkin, Daniel B. (1990). ''Discordant Harmonies: A New Ecology for the Twenty-First Century.'' Oxford Univ. Press, NY, NY. {{ISBN|0-19-507469-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of which model is most accurate, [[environmentalism|environmentalists]] {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} contend that massive human economic activity has pushed the [[biosphere]] far from its "natural" state through reduction of [[biodiversity#Ecological role of biodiversity|biodiversity]], [[climate change]], and other influences. As a consequence, civilization is causing [[Extinction event|mass extinction]] at a rate between 100 species a day and possibly 140,000 species a year, which is 10,000 times the background rate of extinction. Deep ecologists hope to influence social and political change through their philosophy. Næss has proposed, as [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] writes, "that the earth’s human population should be reduced to about 100 million."&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke1998"/&gt;

== Environmental education ==
Ecology in the narrow sense refers to the biological science of [[ecology]]. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms have to do with the way we approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. Human ecology, e.g., must certainly take account of the role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as well as our biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes.&lt;ref name="Smith2014" /&gt; Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriate because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to be the best way to start. Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their interconnectedness with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally and intellectually in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for learners to engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure to care about the natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and civic responsibility, active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.

Ecopedagogy calls for the remaking of capitalist practices and seeks to re-engage democracy to include multispecies interests in the face of our current global ecological crisis. It does so by using different ideas that challenge the way we see education.  In Critical Pedagogy, Ecoliteracy and Planetary Crisis: The Ecopedagogy Movement, Richard Kahn (2010) reformulates Herbert Marcuse’s critical theories of society, and supports the kind of education that seizes the power of radical environmental activists and supports the earth democracy in which multispecies interests are represented. The destruction of habitats and threats to biodiversity resulting from expansion of human population and consumption is rarely addressed in a way that confronts students with the necessity to consider moral implications of such destruction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kopnina|first=Helen|date=2015-03-01|title=If a Tree Falls and Everybody Hears the Sound: Teaching Deep Ecology to Business Students|url=http://jsd.sagepub.com/content/9/1/101|journal=Journal of Education for Sustainable Development|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=101–116|doi=10.1177/0973408215569119|issn=0973-4082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pedagogically, a return to education associated with significant life experiences, such as hiking in wilderness areas as a youth; as well as strategically significant education, action competence, social learning, and variations and combinations of those and many other pedagogical approaches developed in the past 40 years. Some of these pedagogical approaches have been disputed—for example, the belief that experiencing environment first hand is an essential component of engaging people in conservation has been disputed by arguments that these education efforts have been informed by behaviorist socio-psychology models that assumed a linear causality between education experience and pro-environmental behavior.&lt;ref name="Misiaszek2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Misiaszek|first1=Greg William|title=Ecopedagogy and Citizenship in the Age of Globalisation: connections between environmental and global citizenship education to save the planet|journal=European Journal of Education|volume=50|issue=3|year=2015|pages=280–292|issn=01418211|doi=10.1111/ejed.12138}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather, the critics have argued that people’s environmental behaviors are too complex and contextually dependent to be captured by a simple casual model. The process of environmental education of schoolchildren has the following methodological characteristics:

* Goal-setting as the projected results reflects a model of environmentally responsible personality, taking into account trends in the development of key elements of education system; all natural sciences are involved in the development of basic ecological concepts.

* The introduction of interactive training methods takes place at the high school level in teaching self-reflection, hypothesizing, predicting; school natural science education is rebuilt on the basis of system approach in accordance with the planned ecologization results. Implementation of relevant methodology will promote successful development of environmentally responsible personality in high school graduates.&lt;ref name="Misiaszek2015" /&gt;

In higher education, the analysis of students’ individual writing assignments after viewing films/documentaries presents an interesting case of using radical ‘messages’ within the aims of environmental education in order to trigger both student’s engagement and critical thinking. The case study “If a Tree Falls and Everybody Hears the Sound” provides an example of how environmental advocacy and the objective of pluralistic education can be combined as mutually supportive means of achieving both democratic learning in which students’ individual opinions are seen as extremely valuable, and simultaneously provide an example of the type of ecopedagogy that supports learning for environmental sustainability. The role of environmental advocacy can be crucially important if the interests of all planetary citizens—and not just one species—are to be taken seriously.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In her book ''Wild Children — Domesticated Dreams: Civilization and the Birth of Education'', [[Layla AbdelRahim]] argues that the current institutions responsible for the construction and transmission of civilized epistemology are driven by the destructive premises at the foundation of civilization and human predatory culture.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wild children--domesticated dreams : civilization and the birth of education|last=Layla.|first=AbdelRahim|date=2013|publisher=Fernwood Pub|isbn=9781552665480|location=Winnipeg|oclc=829422058}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to return to a viable socio-environmental culture, AbdelRahim calls for the rewilding of our anthropology (i.e. our place among other species) and of pedagogical culture, which in civilization is based on the same domestication methods of other animals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children's literature, domestication, and social foundation : narratives of civilization and wilderness|last=1964-|first=AbdelRahim, Layla|isbn=9780415661102|location=New York|oclc=897810261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==

===Scientific===
[[File:Biogradska suma.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Old-growth forest]] in [[Biogradska Gora National Park]], [[Montenegro]]]]
Næss and Fox do not claim to use [[logic]] or [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] to derive the philosophy directly from scientific ecology&lt;ref name="Naess1973" /&gt; but rather hold that scientific ecology directly implies the metaphysics of deep ecology, including its ideas about the self and further, that deep ecology finds scientific underpinnings in the fields of [[ecology]] and [[system dynamics]].

In their 1985 book ''Deep Ecology'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Devall and George Sessions describe a series of sources of deep ecology.  They include the science of ecology itself, and cite its major contribution as the rediscovery in a modern context that "everything is connected to everything else."  They point out that some ecologists and natural historians, in addition to their scientific viewpoint, have developed a deep ecological consciousness—for some a [[political consciousness]] and at times a [[spiritual consciousness]].  This is a perspective beyond the strictly human viewpoint, beyond [[anthropocentrism]].  Among the scientists they mention specifically are [[Rachel Carson]], [[Aldo Leopold]], [[John Livingston (naturalist)|John Livingston]], [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and [[Barry Commoner]], together with [[Frank Fraser Darling]], [[Charles Sutherland Elton]], [[Eugene Odum]] and [[Paul Sears]].

A further scientific source for deep ecology adduced by Devall and Sessions is the "new physics", which they describe as shattering [[René Descartes|Descartes]]'s and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s vision of the universe as a machine explainable in terms of simple [[linear]] cause and effect. They propose that Nature is in a state of constant flux and reject the idea of observers as existing independent of their environment.  They refer to [[Fritjof Capra]]'s ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' and ''[[The Turning Point (book)|The Turning Point]]'' for their characterisation of how the new physics leads to metaphysical and ecological views of interrelatedness, which, according to Capra, should make deep ecology a framework for future human societies. Devall and Sessions also credit the American poet and social critic [[Gary Snyder]]—with his devotion to [[Buddhism]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] studies, the outdoors, and alternative social movements—as a major voice of wisdom in the evolution of their ideas.

The [[Gaia hypothesis]] was also an influence on the deep ecology movement.&lt;ref&gt;David Landis Barnhill, Roger S. Gottlieb (eds.), ''Deep Ecology and World Religions: New Essays on Sacred Ground'', SUNY Press, 2010, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritual===
The central spiritual tenet of deep ecology is that the human species is a part of the Earth, not separate from it, and as such human existence is dependent on the diverse organisms within the natural world each playing a role in the natural economy of the biosphere. Coming to an awareness of this reality involves a transformation of an outlook that presupposes humanity's superiority over the natural world. This self-realisation or "re-earthing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Deep Ecology &amp; re-earthing ~ Q&amp;A|url=http://www.users.on.net/~arachne/deepeco.html|work=users.on.net/~arachne/index.html|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used for an individual to intuitively gain an ecocentric perspective. The notion is based on the idea that the more we ''expand the self'' to identify with "others" (people, animals, ecosystems), the more we realize ourselves.  [[Transpersonal psychology]] has been used by [[Warwick Fox]] to support this idea.  Deep ecology has influenced the development of contemporary [[ecospirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aburrow|first=Yvonne|title=Eco-spirituality and theology|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/sermonsfromthemound/2013/01/eco-spirituality-and-theology/|work=Sermons from the Mound|publisher=Patheos|accessdate=7 January 2014|date=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of spiritual and philosophical traditions including [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], Buddhist and [[Jainism|Jain]] are drawn upon in a continuing critique of the philosophical assumptions of the modern European mind which has enabled and led to what is seen as an increasingly unsustainable level of disregard towards the rights and needs of the natural world and its ability to continue to support human life. In relation to the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition, Næss offers the following criticism: "The arrogance of stewardship [as found in the [[Bible]]] consists in the idea of superiority which underlies the thought that we exist to watch over nature like a highly respected middleman between the [[God|Creator]] and Creation."&lt;ref&gt;Næss, Arne. (1989). ''Ecology, Community and Lifestyle: Outline of an Ecosophy''. p. 187. {{ISBN|0-521-34873-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This theme had been expounded in [[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.]]'s 1967 article "The Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Næss' further criticizes the reformation's view of creation as property to be put into maximum productive use: a view used frequently in the past to exploit and dispossess native populations.  Many Protestant sects today regard the Bible's call for man to have stewardship of the earth as a call for the care for creation, rather than for exploitation.

The original Christian teachings on property support the Franciscan/stewardship interpretation of the Bible. Against this view, Martin Luther condemned church ownership of lands because "they did not want to use that property in an economically productive fashion. At best they used it to produce prayers. Luther, and other Reformation leaders insisted that it should be used, not to relieve men from the necessity of working, but as a tool for making more goods. The attitude of the Reformation was practically, "not prayers, but production." And production, not for consumption, but for more production." This justification was offered to support secular takings of church endowments and properties.&lt;ref&gt;Schlatter, Richard (1951). Private Property: the History of an Idea. (Rutgers Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist [[Layla AbdelRahim]] sees the root of the anthropogenic degradation of the biosphere in the anthropology that constructs the human animal as the supreme predator. The ontological explanation offered for Human Supremacy by both science and religion, she says, alienate the human being from the community of life and allow for an immoral control and destruction of the wilderness, which, according to her contains the spirit and intelligence of life.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Philosophical roots ===

==== Spinoza ====
[[Arne Næss]], who first wrote about the idea of deep ecology, from the early days of developing this outlook conceived [[Baruch Spinoza]] as a philosophical source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Naess | first1 = A. | doi = 10.1007/BF02379991 | title = Spinoza and ecology | journal = Philosophia | volume = 7 | pages = 45–54 | year = 1977 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have followed Næss' inquiry, including Eccy de Jonge, in ''Spinoza and Deep Ecology: Challenging Traditional Approaches to Environmentalism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de Jonge |first=Eccy |date=April 28, 2004 |title=Spinoza and Deep Ecology: Challenging Traditional Approaches to Environmentalism (Ashgate New Critical Thinking in Philosophy)  |url= |location= |publisher=Routledge |page= |isbn=978-0754633273}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brenden MacDonald, in ''Spinoza, Deep Ecology, and Human Diversity—Realization of Eco-Literacies''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacDonald|first=Brenden James|date=2012-05-14|title=Spinoza, Deep Ecology, and Human Diversity -- Schizophrenics and Others Who Could Heal the Earth If Society Realized Eco-Literacy|url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/view/1229|journal=Trumpeter|language=en|volume=28|issue=1|pages=89–101|issn=1705-9429}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;!--http://www.environment-ecology.com/deep-ecology/63-deep-ecology.html mentions it --&gt;.

One of the topical centres of inquiry connecting Spinoza to Deep Ecology is "self-realization."  See Arne Næss in ''The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology movement'' and ''Spinoza and the Deep Ecology Movement'' for discussion on the role of Spinoza's conception of self-realization and its link to deep ecology.

==Criticism, debate, and response==

===Knowledge of non-human interests===
Animal rights activists state that for an entity to require rights and protection [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsically]], it must have interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep ecology is criticised for assuming that living things such as plants, for example, have their own interests as they are manifested by the plant's behavior—for instance, self-preservation being considered an expression of a will to live. Deep ecologists claim to ''identify'' with non-human nature, and in doing so, deny those who claim that non-human (or non-sentient) lifeforms' needs or interests are nonexistent or unknowable. The criticism is that the interests that a deep ecologist attributes to non-human organisms such as survival, reproduction, growth, and prosperity are really human interests. This is sometimes construed as a [[pathetic fallacy]] or [[anthropomorphism]], in which "the earth is endowed with 'wisdom', wilderness equates with 'freedom', and life forms are said to emit 'moral' qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==="Deepness"===
Deep ecology is criticised for its claim to being ''deeper'' than alternative theories, which by implication are ''shallow''. When [[Arne Næss]] coined the term ''deep ecology'', he compared it favourably with ''shallow environmentalism'' which he criticized for its [[utilitarian]] and [[anthropocentric]] attitude to nature and for its [[economic materialism|materialist]] and [[consumerism|consumer-oriented]] outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| author=Great River Earth Institute
| url=http://www.greatriv.org/de.htm
| title=Deep Ecology: Environmentalism as if all beings mattered
| accessdate=2006-04-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against this is [[Arne Næss]]'s own view that the "depth" of deep ecology resides in the persistence of its penetrative questioning, particularly in asking "Why?" when faced with initial answers.

Writer William D. Grey believes that developing a non-anthropocentric set of values is "a hopeless quest". He seeks an improved "shallow" view, writing, "What's wrong with shallow views is not their concern about the well-being of humans, but that they do not really consider enough in what that well-being consists. We need to develop an enriched, fortified anthropocentric notion of human interest to replace the dominant short-term, sectional and self-regarding conception."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uq.edu.au/~pdwgrey/pubs/anthropocentrism.html Anthropocentrism and Deep Ecology by William Grey]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bookchin's criticisms===
Some critics, particularly [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecologist]] [[Murray Bookchin]], have interpreted deep ecology as being [[misanthropic|hateful toward humanity]], due in part to the characterization of humanity by some deep ecologists, such as [[David Foreman]] of [[Earth First!]], as a pathological infestation on the Earth.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke1998"&gt;[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] (1998). ''[[Hitler's Priestess]]: Savitri Devi, the Hindu-Aryan Myth, and Neo-Nazism''. NY: New York University Press, {{ISBN|0-8147-3110-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bookchin&lt;ref name="Bookchin 1987"&gt;{{cite web

therefore asserts that "deep ecology, formulated largely by privileged male white academics, has managed to bring sincere naturalists like Paul Shepard into the same company as patently antihumanist and macho mountain men like David Foreman who preach a gospel that humanity is some kind of cancer in the world of life."&lt;ref name="Bookchin 1987"/&gt; Bookchin mentions that some, like Foreman, defend seemingly anti-human measures, such as severe population control and the claim regarding the Third World that "the best thing would be to just let nature seek its own balance, to let the people there just starve".&lt;ref name="Bookchin 1987"/&gt; However, Bookchin himself later admitted that "statements made by Earth First! activists are not to be confused with those made by deep ecology theorists".&lt;ref name="Zimmerman 1993"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecophilosopher [[Warwick Fox]] similarly "warns critics not to commit the fallacy of 'misplaced misanthropy.' That is, just because deep ecology criticizes an arrogant anthropocentrism does ''not'' mean that deep ecology is misanthropic."&lt;ref name="Zimmerman 1993"/&gt; Likewise, ''The Deep Ecology Movement: An Introductory Anthology'' attempts to clarify that "deep ecologists have been the strongest critics of [[anthropocentrism]], so much so that they have often been accused of a mean-spirited misanthropy"; however, "deep ecology is actually vitally concerned with humans realizing their best potential" and "is explicit in offering a vision of an alternative way of living that is joyous and enlivening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Deep Ecology Movement|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, CA|year=1995|editor=Alan Drengson and Yuichi Inoue|page=262|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5M4SwWkKLZ4C&amp;printsec=onepage&amp;q=262|isbn=9781556431982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookchin's second major criticism is that deep ecology fails to link environmental crises with [[authoritarianism]] and [[hierarchy]]. Social ecologists like him believe that environmental problems are firmly rooted in the manner of human social interaction, and suggest that deep ecologists fail to recognise the potential for human beings to solve environmental issues through a change of cultural attitudes. According to Bookchin, it is a social reconstruction alone that "can spare the biosphere from virtual destruction."&lt;ref name="Bookchin 1987"/&gt; Though some deep ecologists may reject the argument that ecological behavior is rooted in the social paradigm (which, according to their view, would be an anthropocentric fallacy), others in fact embrace this argument, such as the adherents to the deep ecologist movement [[Deep Green Resistance]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; has likened deep ecology to its antithesis, the [[wise use]] movement, when he says that they both "misunderstand scientific information and then arrive at conclusions based on their misunderstanding, which are in turn used as justification for their ideologies. Both begin with an ideology and are political and social in focus." Elsewhere, though, he asserts that deep ecology must be taken seriously in the debate about the relationship between humans and nature because it challenges the fundamental assumptions of [[Western philosophy]]. Botkin has also criticized Næss's restatement and reliance upon the balance of nature idea and the perceived contradiction between his argument that all species are morally equal and his disparaging description of [[pioneering species]].

=== Response ===
Some writers have misunderstood Næss, taking his ecosophy T, with its self-realization norm, as something meant to characterize the whole deep ecology movement as part of a single philosophy called "deep ecology". Næss was not doing either of these. He emphasized that movements cannot be precisely defined, but only roughly characterized by very general statements. They are often united internationally by means of such principles as found in the United Nations (UN) Earth Charter (1980), and in UN documents about basic human rights. Næss was doing something more subtle than many thought. He was not putting forth a single worldview and philosophy of life that everyone should adhere to in support of the international ecology movement. Instead, he was making an empirical claim based on overwhelming evidence that global social movements, from the grass roots up, consist of people with very diverse religious, philosophical, cultural, and personal orientations. Nonetheless, they can agree on certain courses of action and certain broad principles, especially at the international level. As supporters of a given movement, they can treat one another with mutual respect. Because of these misunderstandings Næss introduced an apron diagram to clearly illustrate his subtle distinctions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The apron diagram is meant to illustrate logical, as distinct from genetic, relations between views and their connection with social movements, policies and practical actions. By "logical relations" this means verbally articulated relations between the premises and conclusions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is collective cooperation on global concerns, and yet a great variety of ultimate premises from which each person or group acts locally. Within global movements there is diversity at the local level because each place and community is different and must adapt to its unique setting. Thus, Næss stressed that his ecosophy T is not meant to hold for everyone, since it is tailored to his very modest lifestyle suitable to a place such as Tvergastein. The ultimate premises for his whole view might be conceptually incompatible with those in someone else's whole views. But even if this is true, they could both support the platform principles of the deep ecology movement and other social-political global movements, such as for peace and social justice. In recognizing the principle that all living beings have intrinsic worth, there is an acknowledgement that they are good for their own sake. This does not mean committing to biocentric equality or egalitarianism between species. Within the vast diversity of living beings, there are complex relationships the range of which is predation, competition, cooperation, and symbiosis. Many think that symbiosis and complementarity are important values to embrace as they are consistent with global cooperation, community life, and support for the deep ecology movement platform.

==Ecofeminist response==
Ecofeminism and deep ecology have been in dialogue for some time now, and while the debate between them has been very fruitful over the years, the exploration of their relationship remains important. As valuable as our individually reconnecting with the natural world may be, and as much as such experiences should be encouraged, [[weasel words|some]] have questioned whether this approach is sufficient, given the magnitude of the threat that human encroachment poses to the nonhuman world. With this in mind, the call has been made for a broader challenge to the dominant culture than deep ecological experience may offer. This call has come most forcefully from another school of environmental ethics: ecofeminism. While sharing with deep ecologists a general concern for biocentrism and an appreciation for personal interaction with nonhuman reality, ecofeminists have also offered some harsh criticism of Leopold, Callicott, and advocates of the deep ecological approach, as well as extensionists like Singer and Regan.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Diehm |first=Christian |date=2003 |title=The Self of Stars and Stone: Ecofeminism, Deep Ecology, and the Ecological Self |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/79/79 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=31–45 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like deep ecology, ecofeminism is not a singular theory, and covers a broad range of thought; in rough terms, its criticism of other forms of nature ethics is grounded in an attempt to synthesize the insights of environmental ethics and animal advocacy with a feminist analysis of Western ethics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Booth |first=Annie |date=2000 |title=Ways of Knowing: Acceptable Understandings Within Bioregionalism, Deep Ecology, Ecofeminism, and Native American Cultures |url=http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/viewFile/145/170 |journal=The Trumpeter |volume=16 |issue=1 |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting attempt to rethink our relationship to the animal and nature casts speciesism and anthropocentrism as symptoms of a deeper patriarchy in the Western tradition that needs to be deconstructed before a successful animal ethic can be produced. As Josephine Donovan details, there is evidence to suggest a strong emotional and philosophical affinity among Anglo-American antivivisectionists and suffragettes, who viewed their causes as common responses to Enlightenment rationalism and scientism, and jointly sought a “feminizing” of culture that would liberate human and animal alike.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ecological feminism began as a critique and rejection of the western cultural worldview with its overemphasis on rationality, and linearity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fellenz|first=Marc R.|title=The Moral Menagerie|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/611905|language=English|isbn=9780252091186|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argued against a Cartesian science which elevated the material and objective above the spiritual and the subjective as appropriate ways of knowing the world. Like deep ecology, ecological feminism stresses the importance of experience, and personal experience at that. However, the ecofeminists seem to be talking about experience in a sense more related to bioregionalism than deep ecology.

Both [[ecofeminism]] and deep ecology put forward a new conceptualization of the self. Some ecofeminists, such as [[Marti Kheel]],&lt;ref&gt;Kheel, Marti. (1990): ''Ecofeminism and Deep Ecology; reflections on identity and difference'' from: Diamond, Irene. Orenstein. Gloria (editors), ''Reweaving the World; The emergence of ecofeminism''. Sierra Club Books. San Francisco. pp 128-137. {{ISBN|0-87156-623-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that self-realization and identification with all nature places too much emphasis on the whole, at the expense of the independent being. Similarly, some ecofeminists place more emphasis on the problem of [[androcentrism]] rather than [[anthropocentrism]]. To others, like [[Karen J. Warren]], the domination of women is tethered conceptually and historically to the domination of nature. Ecofeminism denies abstract [[individualism]] and embraces the interconnectedness of the living world; relationships, including our relationship with non-human nature, are not extrinsic to our identity and are essential in defining what it means to be human. Warren argues that hierarchical classifications in general, such as [[racism]] or [[speciesism]], are all forms of [[discrimination]] and are no different from [[sexism]]. Thus, [[anthropocentrism]] is simply another form of discrimination as a result of our flawed [[value system|value structure]] and should be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Warren|first=Karen J.|authorlink=Karen J.

Experiential deep ecologist [[Joanna Macy]] has attempted to avoid these conflicts and criticisms through her [[Work that Reconnects]].  By focussing deep ecology on the experience of the consciousness of personal depth within the participant, she speaks of "the greening of the self", which is part of the epochal journey of our times from an [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]ic or [[egotistical]] self to an ecological self.

==Links with other philosophies==
Parallels have been drawn between deep ecology and other philosophies, in particular those of the [[animal rights]] movement, [[Earth First!]], [[Deep Green Resistance]], and [[anarcho-primitivism]].

[[Peter Singer]]'s 1975 book ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' critiqued anthropocentrism and put the case for animals to be given moral consideration. This can be seen as a part of a process of expanding the prevailing system of ethics to wider groupings. However, Singer has disagreed with deep ecology's belief in the intrinsic value of nature separate from questions of suffering, taking a more utilitarian stance.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, Gillian (May 2011 ). [http://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/425/the_greater_good The Greater Good: Peter Singer On How To Live An Ethical Life]. ''Sun Magazine'', The Sun Interview, Issue 425. Retrieved on: 2011-12-02&lt;/ref&gt; The [[feminism|feminist]] and [[civil rights movement]]s also brought about expansion of the ethical system for their particular domains. Likewise deep ecology brought the whole of nature under moral consideration.&lt;ref name="Zimmermann"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The links with [[animal rights]] are perhaps the strongest, as "proponents of such ideas argue that 'All life has intrinsic value'".&lt;ref name="Wall"&gt;{{cite book

Many in the radical environmental direct-action movement [[Earth First!]] claim to follow deep ecology, as indicated by one of their slogans ''No compromise in defence of mother earth''. In particular, [[David Foreman]], the co-founder of the movement, has also been a strong advocate for deep ecology, and engaged in a public debate with [[Murray Bookchin]] on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judi Bari]] was another prominent Earth Firster who espoused deep ecology. Many Earth First! actions have a distinct deep ecological theme; often these actions will be to save an area of [[old growth forest]], the habitat of a snail or an owl, even individual trees. Actions are often symbolic or have other political aims. At one point Arne Næss also engaged in environmental direct action, though not under the Earth First! banner, when he chained himself to rocks in front of [[Mardalsfossen]], a waterfall in a Norwegian [[fjord]], in a successful protest against the building of a dam.&lt;ref&gt;J. Seed, J. Macy, P. Flemming, A. Næss, ''Thinking like a mountain: towards a council of all beings'', Heretic Books (1988), {{ISBN|0-946097-26-7}}, {{ISBN|0-86571-133-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also [[anarchism|anarchist]] currents in the movement, especially in the United Kingdom. For example, [[Robert Hart (horticulturist)|Robert Hart]], pioneer of [[forest gardening]] in temperate climates, wrote the essay "Can Life Survive?" in ''Deep Ecology &amp; Anarchism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Deep Ecology &amp; Anarchism|publisher=Freedom Press|year=1993|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Various_Authors__Deep_Ecology___Anarchism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27652">In [[mathematics]], specifically [[multilinear algebra]], a '''dyadic''' or '''dyadic tensor''' is a second [[Tensor (intrinsic definition)#Definition via tensor products of vector spaces|order]] [[tensor]], written in a notation that fits in with [[vector algebra]].

There are numerous ways to multiply two [[Euclidean vector]]s. The [[dot product]] takes in two vectors and returns a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]], while the [[cross product]] returns a [[pseudovector]]. Both of these have various significant geometric interpretations and are widely used in mathematics, [[physics]], and [[engineering]]. The '''dyadic product''' takes in two vectors and returns a second order tensor called a ''dyadic'' in this context. A dyadic can be used to contain physical or geometric information, although in general there is no direct way of geometrically interpreting it.

The dyadic product is [[distributive property|distributive]] over [[vector addition]], and [[associative]] with [[scalar multiplication]]. Therefore, the dyadic product is [[linear]] in both of its operands. In general, two dyadics can be added to get another dyadic, and [[scalar multiplication|multiplied]] by numbers to scale the dyadic. However, the product is not [[commutative]]; changing the order of the vectors results in a different dyadic.

The formalism of '''dyadic algebra''' is an extension of vector algebra to include the dyadic product of vectors. The dyadic product is also associative with the dot and cross products with other vectors, which allows the dot, cross, and dyadic products to be combined together to obtain other scalars, vectors, or dyadics.

It also has some aspects of [[matrix algebra]], as the numerical components of vectors can be arranged into [[row and column vectors]], and those of second order tensors in [[square matrix|square matrices]]. Also, the dot, cross, and dyadic products can all be expressed in matrix form. Dyadic expressions may closely resemble the matrix equivalents.

The dot product of a dyadic with a vector gives another vector, and taking the dot product of this result gives a scalar derived from the dyadic. The effect that a given dyadic has on other vectors can provide indirect physical or geometric interpretations.

Dyadic notation was first established by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] in 1884. The notation and terminology are relatively obsolete today. Its uses in physics include [[continuum mechanics]] and [[electromagnetism]].

In this article, upper-case bold variables denote dyadics (including dyads) whereas lower-case bold variables denote vectors. An alternative notation uses respectively double and single over- or underbars.

==Definitions and terminology==

===Dyadic, outer, and tensor products===

A ''dyad'' is a [[tensor]] of [[Tensor order|order]] two and [[Tensor rank|rank]] one, and is the result of the dyadic product of two [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s ([[complex vector]]s in general), whereas a ''dyadic'' is a general [[tensor]] of [[Tensor order|order]] two (which may be full rank or not).

There are several equivalent terms and notations for this product:
*the '''dyadic product''' of two vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; (no symbol; no multiplication signs, crosses, dots etc.)
*the '''[[outer product]]''' of two [[column vector]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; is denoted and defined as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} \otimes \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\mathbf{b}^T&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; means [[transpose]],
*the '''[[tensor product]]''' of two vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} \otimes \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;,

In the dyadic context they all have the same definition and meaning, and are used synonymously, although the '''tensor product''' is an instance of the more general and abstract use of the term.

Dirac's [[bra–ket notation]] makes the use of dyads and dyadics intuitively clear, see [[#Cahill|Cahill (2013)]].

====Three-dimensional Euclidean space====

To illustrate the equivalent usage, consider [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]], letting:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = a_1 \mathbf{i} + a_2 \mathbf{j} + a_3 \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b} = b_1 \mathbf{i} + b_2 \mathbf{j} + b_3 \mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;

be two vectors where '''i''', '''j''', '''k''' (also denoted '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are the standard [[basis vectors]] in this [[vector space]] (see also [[Cartesian coordinates]]). Then the dyadic product of '''a''' and '''b''' can be represented as a sum:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{llll}
\mathbf{ab} = &amp; a_1 b_1 \mathbf{i i} &amp; + a_1 b_2 \mathbf{i j} &amp; + a_1 b_3 \mathbf{i k} \\
&amp;+ a_2 b_1 \mathbf{j i} &amp; + a_2 b_2 \mathbf{j j} &amp; + a_2 b_3 \mathbf{j k}\\
&amp;+ a_3 b_1 \mathbf{k i} &amp; + a_3 b_2 \mathbf{k j} &amp; + a_3 b_3 \mathbf{k k}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

or by extension from row and column vectors, a 3&amp;times;3 matrix (also the result of the outer product or tensor product of '''a''' and '''b'''):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a b} \equiv \mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b} \equiv \mathbf{a b}^\mathrm{T} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
 a_1 \\
 a_2 \\
 a_3
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
 b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; b_3
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
 a_1b_1 &amp; a_1b_2 &amp; a_1b_3 \\
 a_2b_1 &amp; a_2b_2 &amp; a_2b_3 \\
 a_3b_1 &amp; a_3b_2 &amp; a_3b_3
\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

A ''dyad'' is a component of the dyadic (a [[monomial]] of the sum or equivalently an entry of the matrix) — the dyadic product of a pair of [[basis vector]]s [[scalar multiplication|scalar multiplied]] by a number.

Just as the standard basis (and unit) vectors '''i''', '''j''', '''k''', have the representations:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i} = \begin{pmatrix}
 1 \\
 0 \\
 0
\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{j} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 \\
 1 \\
 0
\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 \\
 0 \\
 1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

(which can be transposed), the ''standard basis (and unit) dyads'' have the representation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{ii} = \begin{pmatrix}
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{ik} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix} 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{ji} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{jj} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{jk} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix} 
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{ki} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{kj} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{kk} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix} 
&lt;/math&gt;

For a simple numerical example in the standard basis:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{A} &amp; = 2\mathbf{ij} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\mathbf{ji} - 8\pi \mathbf{jk} + \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} \mathbf{kk} \\
&amp; = 2 \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\

 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====''N''-dimensional Euclidean space====

If the Euclidean space is ''N''-[[dimension]]al, and

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a} = \sum_{i=1}^N a_i\mathbf{e}_i = a_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + a_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + \cdots a_N \mathbf{e}_N&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b} = \sum_{j=1}^N b_j\mathbf{e}_j  = b_1 \mathbf{e}_1 + b_2 \mathbf{e}_2 + \cdots b_N \mathbf{e}_N&lt;/math&gt;

where '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[standard basis]] vectors in ''N''-dimensions (the index ''i'' on '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; selects a specific vector, not a component of the vector as in ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''), then in algebraic form their dyadic product is:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{ab} = \sum _{j=1}^N\sum_{i=1}^N a_ib_j{\mathbf{e}}_i\mathbf{e}_j.&lt;/math&gt;

This is known as the ''nonion form'' of the dyadic. Their outer/tensor product in matrix form is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{ab} = \mathbf{ab}^\mathrm{T} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
 a_1 \\
 a_2 \\
 \vdots \\
 a_N
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}
 b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; b_N
\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}
 a_1b_1 &amp; a_1b_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_1b_N \\
 a_2b_1 &amp; a_2b_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_2b_N \\
 \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
 a_Nb_1 &amp; a_Nb_2 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_Nb_N
\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

A ''dyadic polynomial'' '''A''', otherwise known as a dyadic, is formed from multiple vectors '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} = \sum_i\mathbf{a}_i\mathbf{b}_i = \mathbf{a}_1\mathbf{b}_1+\mathbf{a}_2\mathbf{b}_2+\mathbf{a}_3\mathbf{b}_3+\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

A dyadic which cannot be reduced to a sum of less than ''N'' dyads is said to be complete. In this case, the forming vectors are non-coplanar,{{Dubious|date=October 2012}} see [[#Chen|Chen (1983)]].

== Dyadic algebra ==

|}

==== Double-dot product ====

There are two ways to define the double dot product, one must be careful when deciding which convention to use. As there are no analogous matrix operations for the remaining dyadic products, no ambiguities in their definitions appear.

The double-dot product is [[commutative]] due to commutativity of the normal dot-product:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} \colon \! \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{B} \colon \! \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;

There is a special double dot product with a [[transpose]]

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} \colon \! \mathbf{B}^\mathrm{T} = \mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T} \colon \! \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt;

Another identity is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\colon\mathbf{B}=\left(\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{B}^\mathrm{T}\right)\colon \mathbf{I}
=\left(\mathbf{B}\cdot\mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T}\right)\colon \mathbf{I} &lt;/math&gt;

==== Double-cross product ====

We can see that, for any dyad formed from two vectors '''a''' and '''b''', its double cross product is zero.

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\mathbf{ab}\right)
\!\!\!\begin{array}{c}
 _\times  \\
 ^\times 
\end{array}\!\!\!
\left(\mathbf{ab}\right)=\left(\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{a}\right)\left(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{b}\right)= 0&lt;/math&gt;

However, by definition, a dyadic double-cross product on itself will generally be non-zero. For example, a dyadic '''A''' composed of six different vectors

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}=\sum _{i=1}^3 \mathbf{a}_i\mathbf{b}_i &lt;/math&gt;

has a non-zero self-double-cross product of

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A}
\!\!\!\begin{array}{c}
 _\times  \\
 ^\times 
\end{array}\!\!\!
\mathbf{A} = 2 \left[\left(\mathbf{a}_1\times \mathbf{a}_2\right)\left(\mathbf{b}_1\times \mathbf{b}_2\right)+\left(\mathbf{a}_2\times \mathbf{a}_3\right)\left(\mathbf{b}_2\times \mathbf{b}_3\right)+\left(\mathbf{a}_3\times \mathbf{a}_1\right)\left(\mathbf{b}_3\times \mathbf{b}_1\right)\right] &lt;/math&gt;

====Tensor contraction====

{{main|Tensor contraction}}

The ''spur'' or ''expansion factor'' arises from the formal expansion of the dyadic in a coordinate basis by replacing each dyadic product by a dot product of vectors:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{llll}
|\mathbf{A}| &amp; = A_{11} \mathbf{i}\cdot\mathbf{i} + A_{12} \mathbf{i}\cdot\mathbf{j} + A_{13} \mathbf{i}\cdot\mathbf{k} \\
&amp; + A_{21} \mathbf{j}\cdot\mathbf{i} + A_{22} \mathbf{j}\cdot\mathbf{j} + A_{23} \mathbf{j}\cdot\mathbf{k}\\
&amp; + A_{31} \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{i} + A_{32} \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{j} + A_{33} \mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{k} \\
\\
&amp; = A_{11} + A_{22} + A_{33} \\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

in index notation this is the contraction of indices on the dyadic:

:&lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{A}| = \sum_i A_i{}^i&lt;/math&gt;

In three dimensions only, the ''rotation factor'' arises by replacing every dyadic product by a [[cross product]]

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{array}{llll}
\langle\mathbf{A}\rangle &amp; = A_{11} \mathbf{i}\times\mathbf{i} + A_{12} \mathbf{i}\times\mathbf{j} + A_{13} \mathbf{i}\times\mathbf{k} \\
&amp; + A_{21} \mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{i} + A_{22} \mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{j} + A_{23} \mathbf{j}\times\mathbf{k}\\
&amp; + A_{31} \mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{i} + A_{32} \mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{j} + A_{33} \mathbf{k}\times\mathbf{k} \\
\\
&amp; = A_{12} \mathbf{k} - A_{13} \mathbf{j} - A_{21} \mathbf{k} \\
&amp; + A_{23} \mathbf{i} + A_{31} \mathbf{j} - A_{32} \mathbf{i} \\
\\
&amp; = (A_{23}-A_{32})\mathbf{i} + (A_{31}-A_{13})\mathbf{j} + (A_{12}-A_{21})\mathbf{k}\\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

In index notation this is the contraction of '''A''' with the [[Levi-Civita tensor]]
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbf{A}\rangle=\sum_{jk}{\epsilon_i}^{jk}A_{jk}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Unit dyadic==

There exists a unit dyadic, denoted by '''I''', such that, for any vector '''a''',

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{I}\cdot\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{I}= \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

for any vector '''a'''.

Given a basis of 3 vectors '''a''', '''b''' and '''c''', with [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] basis &lt;math&gt;\hat{{\mathbf{a}}}, \hat{\mathbf{b}}, \hat{\mathbf{c}}&lt;/math&gt;, the unit dyadic is expressed by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I} = \mathbf{a}\hat{\mathbf{a}} + \mathbf{b}\hat{\mathbf{b}} + \mathbf{c}\hat{\mathbf{c}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the standard basis,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{I} = \mathbf{ii} + \mathbf{jj} + \mathbf{kk} &lt;/math&gt;

Explicitly, the dot product to the right of the unit dyadic is

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\mathbf{I} \cdot \mathbf{a} &amp; = (\mathbf{i}\mathbf{i} + \mathbf{j}\mathbf{j} + \mathbf{k}\mathbf{k})\cdot \mathbf{a} \\
&amp; = \mathbf{i}(\mathbf{i} \cdot \mathbf{a}) + \mathbf{j}(\mathbf{j} \cdot \mathbf{a}) + \mathbf{k} (\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{a}) \\
&amp; = \mathbf{i} a_x + \mathbf{j} a_y + \mathbf{k} a_z \\
&amp; = \mathbf{a} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and to the left

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{I} &amp; = \mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{i}\mathbf{i} + \mathbf{j}\mathbf{j} + \mathbf{k}\mathbf{k})\\
&amp; = (\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{i})\mathbf{i} + (\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{j})\mathbf{j} + (\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{k})\mathbf{k} \\
&amp; = a_x \mathbf{i} + a_y \mathbf{j} + a_z \mathbf{k}  \\
&amp; = \mathbf{a} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding matrix is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}=\begin{pmatrix}
 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This can be put on more careful foundations (explaining what the logical content of "juxtaposing notation" could possibly mean) using the language of tensor products.  If ''V'' is a finite-dimensional [[vector space]], a dyadic tensor on ''V'' is an elementary tensor in the tensor product of ''V'' with its [[dual space]].

The tensor product of ''V'' and its dual space is [[isomorphic]] to the space of [[linear map]]s from ''V'' to ''V'': a dyadic tensor ''vf'' is simply the linear map sending any ''w'' in ''V'' to ''f''(''w'')''v''. When ''V'' is Euclidean ''n''-space, we can use the [[inner product]] to identify the dual space with ''V'' itself, making a dyadic tensor an elementary tensor product of two vectors in Euclidean space.

In this sense, the unit dyadic '''ij''' is the function from 3-space to itself sending ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''i''' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''j''' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''k''' to ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''i''', and '''jj''' sends this sum to ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''j'''. Now it is revealed in what (precise) sense  '''ii''' + '''jj''' + '''kk''' is the identity:  it sends ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''i''' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''j''' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''k''' to itself because its effect is to sum each unit vector in the standard basis scaled by the coefficient of the vector in that basis.

;Properties of unit dyadics

:&lt;math&gt; \left(\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{I}\right)\cdot\left(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{I}\right)= \mathbf{ab}-\left(\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}\right)\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}
\!\!\begin{array}{c}
 _\times  \\
 ^\cdot
\end{array}\!\!\!
\left(\mathbf{ab}\right)=\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{I}
\!\!\begin{array}{c}
 _\times  \\
 ^\times 
\end{array}\!\!
\mathbf{A}=(\mathbf{A}
\!\!\begin{array}{c}
 \colon \!
\end{array}\!\!
\mathbf{I})\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A}^\mathrm{T}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{I}\;\colon\left(\mathbf{ab}\right) = \left(\mathbf{I}\cdot\mathbf{a}\right)\cdot\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} = \mathrm{tr}\left(\mathbf{ab}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where "tr" denotes the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]].

==Examples==

===Vector projection and rejection===

A nonzero vector '''a''' can always be split two perpendicular components, one parallel (‖) to the direction of a [[unit vector]] '''n''', and one perpendicular (⊥) to it;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{a}_\parallel + \mathbf{a}_\perp &lt;/math&gt;

The parallel component is found by [[vector projection]], which is equivalent to the dot product of '''a''' with the dyadic '''nn''',

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_\parallel = \mathbf{n}(\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{a}) = (\mathbf{nn})\cdot\mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

and the perpendicular component is found from [[vector rejection]], which is equivalent to the dot product of '''a''' with the dyadic {{nowrap|'''I''' − '''nn'''}},

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_\perp = \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{n}(\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{a}) = (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{nn})\cdot\mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

===Rotation dyadic===

{{Further|Axis–angle representation}}

====2d rotations====

The dyadic

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J} = \mathbf{ji} - \mathbf{ij} = \begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; -1 \\
 1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

is a 90° anticlockwise [[Rotation operator (vector space)|rotation operator]] in 2d. It can be left-dotted with a vector '''r''' = ''x'''''i''' + ''y'''''j''' to produce the vector,

:&lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{j i} - \mathbf{i j}) \cdot (x \mathbf{i} + y \mathbf{j}) =
x \mathbf{j i} \cdot \mathbf{i} - x \mathbf{i j} \cdot \mathbf{i} + y \mathbf{j i} \cdot \mathbf{j} - y \mathbf{i j} \cdot \mathbf{j} = 
-y \mathbf{i} + x \mathbf{j},&lt;/math&gt;

in summary

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{J}\cdot\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{rot} &lt;/math&gt;

or in matrix notation

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
 0 &amp; -1 \\
 1 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
 x \\
 y
\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}
-y \\
 x
\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

For any angle ''θ'', the 2d rotation dyadic for a rotation anti-clockwise in the plane is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{I}\cos\theta + \mathbf{J}\sin\theta = (\mathbf{ii}+\mathbf{jj})\cos\theta + (\mathbf{ji}-\mathbf{ij})\sin\theta = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\theta &amp;-\sin\theta \\
\sin\theta &amp;\;\cos\theta 
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''I''' and '''J''' are as above, and the rotation of any 2d vector '''a''' = ''a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'''''i''' + ''a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'''''j''' is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{rot} = \mathbf{R}\cdot\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;

====3d rotations====

A general 3d rotation of a vector '''a''', about an axis in the direction of a [[unit vector]] '''ω''' and anticlockwise through angle ''θ'', can be performed using [[Rodrigues' rotation formula]] in the dyadic form

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}_\mathrm{rot} = \mathbf{R} \cdot \mathbf{a} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where the rotation dyadic is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{I} \cos\theta + \sin\theta \boldsymbol{\Omega} +  (1 - \cos\theta) \boldsymbol{\omega\omega} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and the Cartesian entries of '''ω''' also form those of the dyadic

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega} = \omega_x( \mathbf{kj} -\mathbf{jk} ) + \omega_y( \mathbf{ik} -\mathbf{ki} ) + \omega_z( \mathbf{ji} - \mathbf{ij} ) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

The effect of '''Ω''' on '''a''' is the cross product

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega}\cdot\mathbf{a} = \boldsymbol{\omega}\times \mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

which is the dyadic form the [[cross product matrix]] with a column vector.

===Lorentz transformation===

In [[special relativity]], the [[Lorentz boost]] with speed ''v'' in the direction of a unit vector '''n''' can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;t' = \gamma\left(t - \frac{v\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{r}}{c^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}' = [\mathbf{I}  + (\gamma-1) \mathbf{nn}]\cdot \mathbf{r} - \gamma v \mathbf{n}t &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\dfrac{v^2}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Lorentz factor]].

'''Equiveillance''' is a state of equilibrium, or a desire to attain a state of equilibrium, between [[surveillance]] and [[sousveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;Manders, C. (2013, June).

IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes confused with [[The Transparent Society|transparency]].  This balance (equilibrium) allows the individual to construct their own case from evidence they gather themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wearcam.org/anonequiveillance.htm |title=Exporing Equiveillance |publisher=Wearcam.org |date=2003-07-17 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than merely having access to surveillance data that could possibly incriminate them.

Sousveillance, in addition to transparency, can be used to preserve the contextual integrity of surveillance data. For example, a lifelong capture of personal experience could provide "best evidence" over external surveillance data, to prevent the surveillance-only data from being taken out of context.

==Ubiquitous computing==
Equiveillance represents a situation where all parties of a society or economy are empowered to be able to use the tools of accountability to make beneficial decisions.  Humanity has always sought to establish authority relationships: the increasing trend to record information from our environment, and of ourselves creates the need to delineate the relationships between privacy, surveillance, and sousveillance.

The emphasis on [[ubiquitous computing]] is to be contrasted with [[wearable computing]]. As personal cell phones store more information and have the capacity to share it, wearable and mobile computing will make manifest the ability for an individual, or small group of individuals, to monitor larger institutional systems with the goal of developing systems of transparency and accountability. For just as large institutions, such as governments or corporations, store information about the buying habits of the public through an integrated surveillance highway that has a ubiquitous computing infrastructure, individuals can act as consumer activists though a system of inverse surveillance that is based upon a wearable computing infrastructure that assists in maximizing personal privacy and alerting one of information being recorded about the self. Such actions could lead to an equiveillant state, as power and respect are shared.

Panoptic surveillance was described by [[Michel Foucault]] in the context of a prison in which prisoners were isolated from each other but visible at all times by guards. Surveillance tends to isolate individuals from one another while setting forth a one-way visibility to authority figures. This isolation leads to social fragmentation.

Sousveillance has a community-based origin, such as a personal electronic diary (or we[[blog]]), made public on the World Wide Web. Sousveillance tends to bring together individuals, by influencing a large city to function more like a small town: with the pitfalls of gossip, but also the benefits of a sense of community participation. There is a greater degree of responsibility in a sousveillance environment.

Ubiquitous computing ("ubicomp"), also known as pervasive computing ("pervcomp"), is the integration of computers with the environment. Ubiquitous computing tends to rely on cooperation of the immediate infrastructure in the environment, but also has a tendency to centralize information, and hence, centralize authority structures. It also creates segregation, and has implications for social rights such as education and healthcare. Individuals are sorted and classified within a ubiquitous computing environment, leading to a new form of segregation. Ubiquitous computing also places emphasis on [[copyright law]] and undermines creative environments due to the controlling tendencies of authority.

Wearable computing ("wearcomp") refers to portable, wearable computing technologies. Wearcomp doesn't require any special infrastructure in the environment, as the computer is self-contained and self-reliant. With sousveillant computing, it is possible for the focus of control to be more distributed rather than centralized.

A free society is one which places emphasis on respect and the balance of power: in a democratic society, respect and power are shared and well distributed, whereas in a despotic community, respect and power are not shared and are restricted to the few. Increasingly, our society is confronted with the realization of a [[ubiquitous computing]] environment, with the infrastructure predicated upon sensor and surveillance systems to function despite efforts to stop such expansions. How we participate in sharing respect and power will converge with how our society conducts surveillance of its citizens, and how citizens conduct sousveillance. Equiveillance represents a harmonious balance that maximizes human freedom, individual rights as well as communal democracy. The field of personal [[cybernetics]] will converge with the fields of personal imaging and glogging ([[CyborgLog]]ging), as individuals store and archive information for personal use and as a form of self-defense.

To have a society within which personal freedoms and justice are equally distributed, transparency is needed. Transparency increasingly will require dealing with the issues of ubiquitous computing and wearable computing, and maintaining a balance between surveillance and inverse surveillance while maximizing personal privacy.

==Equiveillance table==
Equiveillance establishes a social balance between surveillance and sousveillance, as outlined in a general series of comparisons that is known in the published literature as the "equiveillance table".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyetap.org/papers/docs/acmmm2004sousveillance_p620-mann |title=Proceedings of the Association of Computing Machinery Multimedia (MM) 2004, page 620-627 |publisher=Eyetap.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two kinds of situations that occur when this social balance does not exist: inequiveillance, in which there is a one-sided nature to surveillance (this is the most common situation), and disequiveillance, which is when the balance is not provably one-sided, but, rather, is unequal but not clearly in one or the other direction.

==Inequiveillance (disequiveillance)==
Equiveillance represents a balance of the power relationships that surveillance and sousveillance touch upon. When there is an imbalance, social consequences can range from loss of privacy, to social reactions that in the aggregate lead to unrest and political instability. The idea of disequiveillance is described by [[Paul Virilio]] in his treatise on Dromology and the possibility of freedom loss as an accident of our modern world and how it relates to terrorism and war. In this context, the lack of equiveillance (disequiveillance) refers to the anthropological consequences of a world filled with continuous recording devices that encourage a despotic form of government with a tendency to intrude upon the lives of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bronitt | first1 = Simon | last2 = Michael | first2 = Katina | year = 2012 | title = Human rights, regulation, and national security | url = http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9875&amp;context=infopapers | journal = IEEE Technol. Soc. Mag. | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 15–16 | doi=10.1109/mts.2012.2188704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolving field of sousveillance, stems in part from recent research on the topic of surveillance and inverse-surveillance, shedding light on how media technology is changing our sense of privacy and human freedom. Privacy becomes increasingly a measure of freedom and its control central to personal autonomy.

Increasingly, remembering is influenced by both personal and public search engines, as computing is becoming increasingly dependent upon the [[human–computer interaction]]. The issue of being able to control the amount of personal information that escapes and is recorded in the many machines that make up evolving ubiquitous computing world stresses the importance of equiveillance. The impact of surveillance will be increasingly related to the impact of increasing [[computer storage]] space and data mining processing speed.

A 2005 article by Margaret Papandreou entitled "Is nothing Sacred" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stefanospantagis.net/journal/archives/2005/12/is_nothing_sacr.html |accessdate=December 26, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317173758/http://stefanospantagis.net/journal/archives/2005/12/is_nothing_sacr.html |archivedate=March 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also highlights the issue of disequiveillance and how the theft of personal communications with her son undermined her [[freedom of thought]]. Mrs Papandreou's [[personal computer]] was entered by [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] with malicious intent, with multiple [[emails]], and personal information downloaded and eventually published in book form. The issue of [[freedom of the press]], vs [[theft]] of personal property and [[electronic trespassing]], developed into a subsequent legal action against the journalist and member of the Greek Parliament, [[Liana Kanelli]]. The issue of public vs. private space comes into the debate. The practice of spying as a [[political]] technique creates a flashback to how previous Greek politicians where undermined via covert [[eavesdropping]] and a subsequent outcome from the previous decades of the [[Greek Civil War]]. The complexity of this case becomes twofold when the person surveillanced is a concerned citizen, and not a politician. Furthermore, the issue of taking personal electronic communication out of context for political and financial gain creates the issue of disequiveillance. This can happen on a personal level, or on a larger social, or institutional level.

"The correspondence, which included e-mails, was published in late 2000 and early 2001, in the [[Nemesis magazine]], which was run by journalist and MP Liana Kanelli. It was unclear how Kanelli laid hands on the letters, in which the US-born Papandreou advised the FM on his political career, urging him to make use of non-governmental organizations such as the Andreas Papandreou Foundation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agp.gr/agp/content/Document.aspx?d=7&amp;rd=5499005&amp;f=1427&amp;rf=-2011937565&amp;m=4816&amp;rm=6427264&amp;l=1 |title=/ Andreas G.

Development Studies (ISTAME).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istame-apapandreou.gr/en/profile/history.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218175632/http://www.istame-apapandreou.gr/en/profile/history.htm |date=December 18, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istame-apapandreou.gr/en/goals/specific.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213105540/http://www.istame-apapandreou.gr/en/goals/specific.htm |date=December 13, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nemesis claimed Papandreou had been trying to influence Greek politics." &lt;ref&gt;http://lists.sae.gr/pipermail/neolea/2004-January/000164.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundations of human [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] also are rooted in the idea of [[social contract]]. Biased comments from the conclusion of documents obtained without a [[search warrant]], and against the principles of legal procedure create an unfair forum for judging and condemnation and expose some of the problems of how electronic freedom can be misused towards a systemic persecution and misrepresentation. It also exposes how social instability can rapidly cause a society to evolve into a prison state. Order is maintained in systematic dissolvement of freedom towards a government that operates more like a prison rather than a body of persons made up of "free individuals" with an overemphasis of everyone watching everyone, with anyone becoming an informant for whatever side that may be competing for power.

Unbalanced surveillance, and disequiveillance can rapidly deevolve society towards the en-masse phenomena such as [[racism]], [[scapegoating]] and even mob reactions towards an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leymann.se/English/frame.html |title=The Mobbing Encyclopaedia |publisher=Leymann.se |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927110132/http://leymann.se/English/frame.html |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also of importance to realize that [[justice]] is not rooted in [[Revenge|vengeance]], but rather, the [[law]].

The Margaret Papandreou case highlights the issue of victimization through use of the media as a form of [[propaganda]]. The social emphasis of a big brother society is rapidly transitioning [[Balkan]] nations via the prevalence of &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1886998.stm |title=TV AND RADIO &amp;#124; Ban on Greek Big Brother overturned |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-03-22 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/greek/ana/2001/01-03-03.ana.html#16 |title=Athens News Agency: Daily News Bulletin in English, 01-03-03 |publisher=Hri.org |date=2001-03-05 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; media support of such systems with an increasingly legal disregard for individual privacy.

The issue of privacy as part of freedom is in conflict with an absolutely [[The Transparent Society|transparent society]] where all things become recorded and available. The ability to mediate ones visibility increasingly intersects with the concept of [[wearable computing]], as a form of sheltering the individual from a world filled with recorders and sensors. The ability of controlling ones personal information is increasingly part of how one is to maintain ones personal and free space. Hence protecting ones privacy also intersects with the concept of [[sousveillance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2311">In mathematics and physics, a '''global mode''' of a system is one in which the system executes coherent [[oscillation]]s in time. Suppose a quantity &lt;math&gt;y(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; which depends on space &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is governed by some [[partial differential equation]] which does not have an explicit dependence on &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Then a global mode is a solution of this PDE of the form &lt;math&gt;y(x,t) = \hat{y}(x) e^{i\omega t}&lt;/math&gt;, for some [[frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is complex, then the imaginary part corresponds to the mode exhibiting [[exponential growth]] or [[exponential decay]].

The concept of a global mode can be compared to that of a [[normal mode]]; the PDE may be thought of as a [[dynamical system]] of infinitely many equations coupled together. Global modes are used in the [[stability theory|stability analysis]] of [[hydrodynamics|hydrodynamical systems]]. [[Philip Drazin]] introduced the concept of a global mode in his 1974 paper, and gave a technique for finding the normal modes of a linear PDE problem in which the coefficients or geometry vary slowly in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. This technique is based on the [[WKBJ approximation]], which is a special case of [[multiple-scale analysis]].&lt;ref name="drazin-1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drazin|first1=Philip|title=On a model of instability of a slowly-varying flow|journal=Q J Mechanics Appl Math|date=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; His method extends the [[Briggs–Bers technique]], which gives a stability analysis for linear PDEs with constant coefficients.&lt;ref name="huerre-monkewitz-1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huerre|first1=Patrick|last2=Monkewitz|first2=Peter|title=Local and global instabilities in spatially developing flows.|journal=Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech.|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
Since Drazin's 1974 paper, other authors have studied more realistic problems in fluid dynamics using a global mode analysis. Such problems are often highly [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]], and attempts to analyse them have often relied on laboratory or numerical experiment.&lt;ref name="huerre-monkewitz-1990"/&gt; Examples of global modes in practice include the oscillatory [[wake]]s produced when fluid flows past an object, such as a [[vortex street]].

[[File:The Great Conversation, spine.jpg|thumb|upright|right]]
The '''Great Conversation''' is the ongoing process of writers and thinkers referencing, building on, and refining the work of their predecessors. This process is characterized by writers in the [[Western canon]] making comparisons and allusions to the works of earlier writers. As such it is a name used in the promotion of the ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]'' published by [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] in 1952. It is also the title of (i) the first volume of the first edition of this set of books,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/greatconversatio030336mbp|title=The Great Conversation Vol I|first=Robert M.|last=Hutchins|date=1 April 2018|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc.|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_great_conversation.html?id=gWANAQAAMAAJ|title=The great conversation: the substance of a liberal education|first=Robert Maynard|last=Hutchins|date=1 April 2018|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=1 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Robert Hutchins|Robert Maynard Hutchins]], and (ii) an accessory volume to the second edition (1990), written by [[Mortimer Adler]]. 

According to Hutchins, "The tradition of the West is embodied in the Great Conversation that began in the dawn of history and that continues to the present day".&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Conversation'', Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; Adler said, &lt;blockquote&gt;What binds the authors together in an intellectual community is the great conversation in which they are engaged. In the works that come later in the sequence of years, we find authors listening to what their predecessors have had to say about this idea or that, this topic or that. They not only harken to the thought of their predecessors, they also respond to it by commenting on it in a variety of ways.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer Adler: "The Great Conversation Revisited," in ''The Great Conversation: A Peoples Guide to Great Books of the Western World'', Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., Chicago, 1990, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4407">'''Hypocognition''', in [[cognitive linguistics]], means missing and being unable to communicate cognitive and linguistic representations because there are no words for particular concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hollan |first=Douglas |title=Constructivist Models of Mind, Contemporary Psychoanalysis, and the Development of Culture Theory |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=538–550, See p. 541 |year=2000 |doi=10.1525/aa.2000.102.3.538 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.2000.102.3.538/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

The word hypocognition (and its opposite, [[hypercognition]]) was coined by American [[psychiatrist]] and [[anthropologist]] [[Robert I. Levy|Robert Levy]] in his 1973 book ''Tahitians: Mind and Experience in the Society Islands''. After 26 months of studying them, Levy described [[Tahitians]] as having no words to describe sorrow or guilt, resulting in people who had suffered personal losses describing themselves as feeling sick or strange instead of sad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Robert I.|title=Tahitians: mind and experience in the Society Islands|year=1975|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226476073|page=324|edition=Pbk. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Richard A. |editor-last=Shweder |title=Culture theory: essays on mind, self, and emotion |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521318319 |pages=227–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levy believed the Tahitians' lack of frames for thinking about and expressing grief contributed to their high suicide rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ottenheimer|first=Harriet Joseph|title=The anthropology of language: an introduction to linguistic anthropology|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=0495508845|page=41|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed that a balance between hypercognition and hypocognition was culturally most desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferrara|first=Nadia|title=Emotional expression among Cree Indians: the role of pictorial representations in the assessment of psychological mindedness|year=1998|publisher=Jessica Kingsley|location=London|isbn=1853026565|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

Hypocognition is a phrase commonly used in linguistics. In 2004 [[George Lakoff]] used it to describe political [[progressives]] in the United States, saying that relative to conservatives they suffer from "massive hypocognition," which he described as the lack of having a progressive philosophy framed around the progressive core values of empathy and responsibility such as "effective government" versus "less government" or "broader prosperity" versus "free markets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakoff|first=George|title=Don't think of an elephant!: know your values and frame the debate: the essential guide for progressives|year=2004|publisher=Chelsea Green |location=White River Junction VT|isbn=1931498717|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
Hypocognition has been blamed for preventing the practical application of [[evidence-based medicine]] in areas where [[Framing (social sciences)|frames]] (contextual and presentational influences on perceptions of reality) obscure facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance'''(also called the "Necessary and Proportionate Principles" or just "the Principles") is a document which attempts to "clarify how international human rights law applies in the current [[digital environment]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], at Preface, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
Communications Surveillance([[Mass Surveillance]] of [[Communication]]) conflicts with a number of [[International Human Rights]], mainly that of [[Right to Privacy|Privacy]]. As a result,Communications Surveillance may only occur when prescribed by [[law]] necessary to achieve legitimate aim, and proportionate to the aim used.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 29; General Comment No. 27, Adopted by The Human Rights Committee Under Article 40, Paragraph 4, Of The International Covenant On Civil And Political Rights, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.9, November 2, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism," 2009, A/HRC/17/34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank La Rue, "Report of the Special Rapporteur to the Human Rights Council on the implications of States' surveillance of communications on the exercise of the human rights to privacy and to freedom of opinion and expression", 2013, A.HRC.23.40 EN&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The document consists of 13 principles developed to provide society groups, [[industry]], [[governments]], and others with a framework to assess whether current and proposed surveillance laws or statutes conflict with International Human Rights law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengovguide.com/standards-and-guidance/international-principles-application-human-rights-communications-surveillance|Open Government Guide on the International Principles on the application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The inception of the principles occurred as a result of a meeting between over 40 experts in [[privacy]] and [[security]] in [[Brussels]], October 2012. After the initial consultation, a second meeting in [[Rio de Janeiro]] took place in December 2012 with the participation of the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]].&lt;ref&gt;UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression, Frank La Rue, A/HRC/23/40, at para 10&lt;/ref&gt; Global consultation followed via conference calls every month between January and May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2013/09/22/surveillance-and-human-rights-principles-are-launched-at-the-24th-hrc&lt;/ref&gt;
The drafting process, led by [[Accessnow.org|Access Now]], [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] and [[Privacy International]], along with several [[Non-Governmental Organisations|NGO's]], Criminal [[Lawyers]], Human rights advocates and privacy advocates were finalized and published for the first time on 10 July 2013 online at www.necessaryandproportionate.org.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Privacy/ElectronicFrontierFoundation.pdf EFF, Necessary and Proportionate], article 19, May 2014 at 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013 at the 24th session of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] in [[Geneva]], they were launched officially.

The principles have now been adopted globally by more than 400 [[organizations]]. The [[globe|global]] adoption necessitated a number of primarily superficial textual changes in the [[language]] of the document for the purposes of [[translation]]. This occurred between March and May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], at Insert, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect and intention of the principles remained the same, and the final and authoritative version of the document was then launched in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance] at Insert, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Support Prior to the Publication of the Principles==

The initial release followed a report from the United Nations Special Rapporteur on [[Freedom of Expression]] and [[Opinion]] in April 2013, which highlights the widespread practice of states surveying communications, stating that such surveillance severely undermines citizens' ability to enjoy a private life, freely express themselves and enjoy their other fundamental human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.40_EN.pdf Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression] 10 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], emphasized the importance of applying human right standards and democratic safeguards to surveillance and law enforcement activities:"While concerns about national security and criminal activity may justify the exceptional and narrowly-tailored use of surveillance programmes, surveillance without adequate safeguards to protect the right to privacy actually risk impacting negatively on the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=13534&amp;  Mass surveillance:Pillay urges respect for right to privacy and protection of individuals revealing human rights violations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

The purpose of the principles was to provide civil society groups, [[Sovereign state|states]], the [[courts]], legislative and regulatory bodies, industry and others with a framework to evaluate whether current or proposed surveillance laws comply with International Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Privacy/ElectronicFrontierFoundation.pdf EFF, Necessary and Proportionate], article 19, May 2014 at 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The concern was that key protections to [[privacy]] had been eroded away with technological advancements, therefore needed robust support in some areas to raise international human rights to the standards which had developed in the pre-digital age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Privacy/ElectronicFrontierFoundation.pdf EFF, Necessary and Proportionate], article 19, May 2014 at 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Principles==

The following is a summary of the document containing the principles. All below is source from the actual document itself, except where noted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preamble===

The preamble of the document recognizes that Communications Surveillance interferes with the [[Right to privacy]], therefore can only be used when it is prescribed by law, necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, and proportionate to the aim pursued.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 29; General Comment No. 27, Adopted by The Human Rights Committee Under Article 40, Paragraph 4, Of The International Covenant On Civil And Political Rights, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.9, November 2, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism," 2009, A/HRC/17/34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank La Rue, "Report of the Special Rapporteur to the Human Rights Council on the implications of States' surveillance of communications on the exercise of the human rights to privacy and to freedom of opinion and expression", 2013, A.HRC.23.40 EN&lt;/ref&gt; The view of the document is that existing human rights law has not kept up with the progression of [[technology]]. The preamble states that the threat to these rights combined with the increase in popularity of using communications content and [[metadata]] that states are not placing "sufficient restrictions on how they can be subsequently used by States".&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles#preamble International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], Preamble, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/12/2013-year-review-principled-fight-against-global-mass-surveillance |title=2013 Year in Review: A Principled Fight Against Global Mass Surveillance &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2013-12-30 |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scope of Application===

To get the correct scope and purpose of application for the document, it is required to be read and interpreted as part of a larger framework rather than as individual principles.
Application of this document is to apply both within states and extra territorially, regardless of purpose.

It is to apply for protection of the individual from the state, and also states there is an obligation of states to protect individuals from [[non-state actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles#scope-of-application International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], at Scope of Application, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The document states that unless the principles are applied this way, a State conducting Communications Surveillance may not meet International Human Rights obligations. The principles are stated to "articulate the duties and obligations of States when engaging in Communications Surveillance".&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles#scope-of-application International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], at Scope of Application, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing Definitions and Technology===

This section of the document is dedicated to the interpretation of certain terms found throughout the document, and highlighting that some of the legal definitions used may not have effectively kept pace with technological change, and require reiteration. 
The principles state that the because of the increased ability of communications surveillance, the existing legal framework which currently distinguishes between 'content' and 'non-content' is no longer appropriate, and protection from all types of surveillance should be given a higher legal priority.

===The Principles===

====Legality====
Any limitation imposed on an International Human Rights must be prescribed by law. Sufficient notice should be given if a proposed law is going to limit one of these rights. The law should be clear, and given periodic review to ensure it remains effective given the speed of technological development.

====Legitimate Aim====
Communications surveillance should only be used by permitted [[State (polity)|state]] [[Authority|authorities]] where necessary in a [[democratic society]]. Any situation where discrimination arises should not be used.

====Necessity====
Surveillance laws should be limited to those which are necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, or where there are multiple means but Communications Surveillance is the least intrusive method on International Human Rights. The onus of establishing necessity should remain with the state&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/principles#the-principles International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance], at Principle of Necessity, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adequacy====
Any communications surveillance authorized by law must be appropriate for the legitimate aim it is fulfilling.

====Proportionality====
Communications Surveillance is regarded as a highly intrusive act, and therefore must consider the sensitivity and severity of the situation. The state should establish the following prior to conducting communications surveillance:
*There is a high chance of serious crime or specific threat
*There is a high degree of probability that relevant evidence will be obtained. 
*Other less invasive techniques have been exhausted, such that communications surveillance is the least intrusive method
*[[Information]] collected will be confined to only which is relevant
*Excess information obtained will be returned or destroyed
*The information accesses will be used by the specific authority for the purpose the authority was given
*The requested authority to use communications surveillance does not undermine the purpose of the right to privacy or other fundamental freedoms.

====Competent Judicial Authority====
The authority determining the validity of the communications surveillance must be independent of those conducting the surveillance, and be competent when making these decisions.

====Due Process====
That everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by a competent judicial authority. Due process can be used interchangeably with "[[procedural fairness]]" and "[[natural justice]]"&lt;ref&gt;European Convention for Human Rights, Article 6(1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The American Convention on Human Rights,Article 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====User Notification====
Those subjects of Communication Surveillance should be given the opportunity to challenge the decision when a decision authorizing Surveillance has been issued. The materials presented in support of the application should be available for those subjects. Delay in notification is acceptable where notification would frustrate the purpose of communication surveillance and authorization is granted by a competent judicial authority.

====Transparency====
Information about use and amount of Communication Surveillance should be available to those who request it. States should provide the requestor with information sufficient to ascertain the nature of the request and determine the size of both the request and those who will be affected by it. Records of requests for communications surveyed should also be published.

====Public Oversight====
States should establish an independent position to oversee the use of Communications Surveillance and to ensure transparency and accountability. The person(s) in this position would have sufficient authority to access all potentially relevant information, to assess whether the State is making legitimate use of its lawful capabilities, to evaluate whether the State has met its transparency obligations, and to make public determinations as to the lawfulness of those actions. The document in this instance makes reference to the United Kingdom's [[Interception of Communications Commissioner]] as an example of such an independent oversight mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iocco-uk.info/sections.asp?sectionID=2&amp;type=top Interception of Communications Commissioner's Office]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrity of communication and systems====
States should not require those service providers or software/hardware vendors to build surveillance/monitoring capability into their systems. People have a right to express themselves anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session23/A.HRC.23.40_EN.pdf Report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression] 10 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Safeguards for International Cooperation====
Where a state has entered into a [[mutual legal assistance treaty]](MLAT) or other multi-jurisdictional agreement where more than one legal jurisdiction overlaps, the laws that apply are those which have the higher level of protection for the individual. MLAT's should also be transparent, publicly available and subject to guarantees of procedural fairness

====Safeguards against illegitimate access and right to effective remedy====
Communications surveillance by third parties should be prohibited with sufficient penalties. Protection for [[whistle-blowers]] should be enacted. Any information obtained by means not consistent with these principles should be inadmissible as evidence. Once information collected by communications surveillance has been used for the purpose for which it was collected it should be promptly destroyed or returned.

==Response==

In October 2013, The Principles were promoted in a brief filed before the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies. They claim that "In a world of ever more complex technology, it is increasingly unclear whether the distinction between "meta-data" and other information carries much weight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2014/01/24/verizon-report-bolsters-calls-to-reform-metadata-protections |title=Blog &amp;#124; Access |publisher=Accessnow.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/pdf/ReviewGroupReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Center for Democracy and Technology]] released a report noting overlap between the Principles and a December 9, 2013 proposal by tech groups such as [[AOL]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Facebook]], [[Google]], [[Linkedin]], [[Microsoft]], [[Twitter]], and [[Yahoo!]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdt.org/paper/common-ground-between-company-and-civil-society-surveillance-reform-principles |title=Common Ground Between Company and Civil Society Surveillance Reform Principles &amp;#124; Center for Democracy &amp; Technology |publisher=Cdt.org |date=2014-01-15 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, the principles have over 400 organizations from across the world supporting the principles along with over 40 [[Experts]], [[Academics]] and prominent individuals from over 17 countries, and 6 [[elected officials]] or [[political parties]] from 5 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://necessaryandproportionate.org/sign List of Signatories]&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles are now being used as model for reform of surveillance law and policy around the world and to provide a benchmark for measuring whether a State's surveillance practices comply with International Human Rights Law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/document/13-international-principles-application-human-rights-communication-surveillance 13 International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communication Surveillance]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kalki''', also called '''Kalkin''' or '''Karki'''&lt;ref name="Brockington1998p287"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. L. Brockington|title=The Sanskrit Epics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HR-_LK5kl18C&amp;pg=PA287 |year=1998|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-10260-4|pages=287–288 with footnotes 126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is the tenth [[avatar]] of Hindu god [[Vishnu]] to end the [[Kali Yuga]], one of the four periods in endless cycle of existence (''krita'') in [[Vaishnavism]] cosmology. He is described in the Puranas as the avatar who rejuvenates existence by ending the darkest and destructive period to remove [[adharma]] and ushering in the [[Satya Yuga]], while riding a white horse with a fiery sword.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p188"/&gt; The description and details of Kalki are inconsistent among the Puranic texts. He is, for example, only an invisible force destroying evil and chaos in some texts, while an actual person who kills those who persecute others, and portrayed as someone leading an army of Brahmin warriors in some. His mythology has been compared to the concepts of [[Messiah]], [[Apocalypse]], [[Frashokereti]] and [[Maitreya]] in other religions.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p188"&gt;{{harvnb|Dalal|2014|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger1999p629"&gt;{{cite book| author1=Wendy Doniger|author2=Merriam-Webster, Inc|title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;pg=PA629 |year=1999|publisher=Merriam-Webster|isbn=978-0-87779-044-0|page=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalki is also found in Buddhist texts. In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the ''[[Kalachakra]]-Tantra'' describes 25 rulers, each named Kalki who rule from the heavenly [[Shambhala]]. The last Kalki of Shambhala destroys a barbarian Muslim army, after which Buddhism flourishes. This text is dated to about 10th-century CE.&lt;ref name="Lopez2015p202"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2017p220"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dahla2006p90"/&gt;
However, some Muslims also claim that the prophet Muhammed was the Kalki avatar, because of his association with a flying white horse, and his father's name is similar in meaning to that of Vishnuyasha, the Father of Kalki.  Some prophecies of Kalki say that he will kill the sinful people and atheists by the millions. The Kalki Purana is the main cannon text about Lord Kalki. In the Kalki Purana Kalki is described as the Supreme Being, source and end of all other beings, and ruler of the universe and gods.

==Etymology==
The name Kalki means "white horse", "destroyer of filth", and "eternity".  &lt;ref name="Klostermaier2006p75"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K. Klostermaier|title=Mythologies and Philosophies of Salvation in the Theistic Traditions of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFQ9DgAAQBAJ |year=2006|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|isbn=978-0-88920-743-1|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars such as Otto Schrader to suggest that the original term may have been ''karki'' (white horse knight, from the horse) which morphed into Kalki. This proposal is supported by two versions of ''Mahabharata'' manuscripts (e.g. the G3.6 manuscript) that have been found, where the Sanskrit verses name the avatar to be "karki", rather than "kalki".&lt;ref name="Brockington1998p287"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. L. Brockington|title=The Sanskrit Epics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HR-_LK5kl18C&amp;pg=PA287 |year=1998|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-10260-4|pages=287–288 with footnotes 126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{Vaishnavism}}
Kalki is an avatara of Vishnu. Avatara means "descent" and refers to a descent of the divine into the material realm of human existence. The [[Garuda Purana]] lists [[Dasavatara of Vishnu#List|ten avatars]], with Kalki being the tenth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 73|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is described as the avatar who appears at the end of the Kali Yuga. He ends the darkest, degenerating and chaotic stage of the Kali ''Yuga'' (period) to remove [[adharma]] and ushers in the [[Satya Yuga]], while riding a white horse with a fiery sword.&lt;ref name="Dalal2010p188"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger1999p629"/&gt; He restarts a new cycle of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ludo Rocher|editor=Ralph M.

===Wheel of Time Tantra===
In the Buddhist text ''Kalachakra Tantra'', the righteous kings are called Kalki (Kalkin, lit. chieftain) living in Sambhala. There are many Kalki in this text, each fighting barbarism, persecution and chaos. The last Kalki is called "Cakrin" and is predicted to end the chaos and degeneration by assembling a large army to eradicate the "forces of Islam".&lt;ref name="Lopez2015p202"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2017p220"/&gt; A great war and Armageddon will destroy the barbaric Muslim forces, states the text.&lt;ref name="Lopez2015p202"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2017p220"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dahla2006p90"&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Björn Dahla|title=Exercising Power: The Role of Religions in Concord and Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_rWAAAAMAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Donner Institute for Research in Religious and Cultural History|isbn=978-952-12-1811-8|pages=90–91}}, '''Quote:''' "(...) the Shambala-bodhisattva-king [Cakravartin Kalkin] and his army will defeat and destroy the enemy army, the barbarian Muslim army and their religion, in a kind of Buddhist Armadgeddon.

==Development==
Kalki is mentioned in several hindu texts including the Agni Purana and Ramayana and Mahabartha. &lt;ref name=academy81&gt;{{cite book|title=Tattvadīpaḥ: Journal of Academy of Sanskrit Research, Volume 5|page=81|publisher=The Academy|year=2001|quote=Kalki, as an incarnation of Visnu, is not found in the Vedic literature. But some of the features of that concept, viz., the fearful elements, the epithet Kalmallkinam (brilliant, remover of darkness) of Rudra, prompt us to admit him as the forerunner of Kalki.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rabiprasad Mishra|title=Theory of Incarnation: Its Origin and Development in the Light of Vedic and Purāṇic References|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XvXAAAAMAAJ |year=2000|publisher=Pratibha |isbn=978-81-7702-021-2|page=146}}, Quote: "Kalki as an incarnation of Visnu is not mentioned in the Vedic literature."&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet "Kalmallkinam", meaning "brilliant remover of darkness", is found in the Vedic literature for [[Rudra]] (later Shiva), which has been interpreted to be "forerunner of Kalki".&lt;ref name=academy81/&gt;

Kalki appears for the first time in the great war epic ''Mahabharata''.&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel2011p104"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alf Hiltebeitel|title=Reading the Fifth Veda: Studies on the Mahābhārata - Essays by Alf Hiltebeitel|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lLfHSOWKB-sC&amp;pg=PA531|year=2011|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-18566-6|pages=89–110, 530–531}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mention of Kalki in the ''Mahabharata'' occurs only once, over the verses 3.188.85–3.189.6.&lt;ref name="Brockington1998p287"/&gt; The Kalki avatar is found in the Maha-Puranas such as ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Horace |authorlink=Horace Hayman Wilson |title=Vishnu Purana |year=2001 |publisher=Ganesha Publishing |isbn=1-86210-016-0 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Matsya Purana]]'', and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theory of Avatāra and Divinity of Chaitanya|first=Janmajit|last=Roy|page=39 |publisher = Atlantic Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myths and Gods of India: The Classic Work on Hindu Polytheism from the Princeton Bollingen Series|first=Alain|last=Daniélou|page=181|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the details relating the Kalki mythologies are divergent between the Epic and the Puranas, as well as within the Puranas.&lt;ref name="Mitchiner2000p68"&gt;{{cite book|author=John E. Mitchiner|title=Traditions Of The Seven Rsis|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=phGzVwTTp_gC|year= 2000|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass |isbn= 978-81-208-1324-3|pages= 68–69 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel2011p104"/&gt;

In the ''Mahabharata'', according to Hiltebeitel, Kalki is an extension of the [[Parasurama]] avatar legend where a Brahmin warrior destroys Kshatriyas who were abusing their power to spread chaos, evil and persecution of the powerless. The Epic character of Kalki restores dharma, restores justice in the world, but does not end the cycle of existence.&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel2011p104"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel2011p288"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alf Hiltebeitel|title=Dharma: Its Early History in Law, Religion, and Narrative|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4NF8pYxdvIC |year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-539423-8|pages=288–292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kalkin section in the ''Mahabharata'' occurs in the Markandeya section. There, states Luis Reimann, can "hardly be any doubt that the Markandeya section is a late addition to the Epic. Making Yudhisthira ask a question about conditions at the end of Kali and the beginning of Krta — something far removed from his own situation — is merely a device for justifying the inclusion of this subject matter in the Epic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Luis González Reimann|title=The Mahābhārata and the Yugas: India's Great Epic Poem and the Hindu System of World Ages|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nXrXAAAAMAAJ|year =2002|publisher= Peter Lang|isbn= 978-0-8204-5530-3|pages= 89–99, quote is on page 97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Dimmitt2012p63"/&gt; The coverage of Kalki in these Hindu texts is scant, in contrast to the legends of Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana and Krishna, all of which are repeatedly and extensively described. According to Dimmitt, this was likely because just like the concept of the Buddha as a Vishnu avatar, the concept of Kalki was "somewhat in flux" when the major Puranas were being compiled. This is because Kalki is a future avatar, prophesied in the past and predicted thousands of years ago. However, many Hindu people worship Lord Kalki and he has several temples in India.&lt;ref name="Dimmitt2012p63"&gt;{{harvnb|Dimmitt|van Buitenen|2012|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This myth may have developed in the Hindu texts both as a reaction to the invasions of the Indian subcontinent by various armies over the centuries from its northwest, and the mythologies these invaders brought with them.&lt;ref name="Brockington1998p287"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doniger2004p235"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Hindu Myths: A Sourcebook Translated from the Sanskrit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQ4IMQAACAAJ |year=2004 |publisher =Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-044990-7|pages=235–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Mitchiner, the Kalki concept was likely borrowed "in some measure from similar Jewish, Zoroastrian and other religions".&lt;ref name="Mitchiner2000p75"&gt;{{cite book|author=John E. Mitchiner|title=Traditions Of The Seven Rsis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phGzVwTTp_gC |year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1324-3|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchiner states that some Puranas such as the Yuga Purana do not mention Kalki and offer a different cosmology than the other Puranas. The Yuga Purana mythologizes in greater details the post-Maurya era Indo-Greek and Saka era, while the Manvantara theme containing the Kalki idea is mythologized greater in other Puranas.&lt;ref name="Mitchiner2000p69"&gt;{{cite book|author=John E. Mitchiner|title=Traditions Of The Seven Rsis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=phGzVwTTp_gC |year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1324-3|pages=69–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel2011p104"/&gt; Luis Gonzales-Reimann concurs with Mitchiner, stating that the Yuga Purana does not mention Kalki.&lt;ref name="Reimann2002p95"&gt;{{cite book|author=Luis González-Reimann|title=The Mahābhārata and the Yugas: India's Great Epic Poem and the Hindu System of World Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nXrXAAAAMAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-0-8204-5530-3|pages=95–99 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other texts such as the sections 2.36 and 2.37 of the Vayu Purana, states Reimann, it is not Kalkin who ends the Kali Yuga, but a different character named Pramiti.&lt;ref name="Reimann2002p112"&gt;{{cite book|author=Luis González Reimann|title=The Mahābhārata and the Yugas: India's Great Epic Poem and the Hindu System of World Ages|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nXrXAAAAMAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-0-8204-5530-3|pages=112–113 note 39}}; Note: Reimann mentions some attempts to "identify both Pramiti and Kalkin with historical rulers".&lt;/ref&gt; Most historians, states Arvind Sharma, link the development of Kalki mythology in Hinduism to the suffering caused by foreign invasions.&lt;ref name="Sharma2012p244"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=Religious Studies and Comparative Methodology: The Case for Reciprocal Illumination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CfZ9y5-FGPgC |year=2012|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8325-1|pages=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kalki Purana===
A  text named [[Kalki Purana]] is a relatively recent text, likely composed in [[Bengal]]. Its dating [[floruit]] is the 18th-century.{{sfn|Rocher|1986|p=183 with footnotes}} Wendy Doniger dates the Kalki mythology containing ''Kalki Purana'' to between 1500 and 1700 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger|title=Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtZRAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA5 |year=1988|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-1867-1|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Kalki Purana'', Kalki marries princess Padmavati, the daughter of Brhadratha of Simhala.{{sfn|Rocher|1986|p=183 with footnotes}} He fights an evil army and many wars, ends evil but does not end existence. Kalki returns to Sambhala, inaugurates a new ''[[yuga]]'' for the good and then goes to [[Vaikuntha]] after ruling the world for 1000 years.{{sfn|Rocher|1986|p=183 with footnotes}}

The Kalki Purana states that Kalki will kill all the atheists and will have many powerful divine weapons obtained from Lord Shiva.  It is said that Kalki will obtain these after training under Lord Parasurama.  

The Kalki Purana describes Lord Kalki as the supreme deity even above Brahma and Shiva, and that he will kill all the sinful kings who have corrupted the world, and restore the dharma.

[Lord [[Shiva]] said to Lord Kalki:] "This '''horse''' was manifested from [[Garuda]], and it can go anywhere at will and assume many different forms. Here also is a '''parrot''' [ [[Shuka]] ] that knows everything - past, present, and future. I would like to offer You both the horse and the parrot and so please accept them. By the influence of this horse and parrot, the people of the world will know You as a learned scholar of all scriptures who is a master of the art of releasing arrows, and thus the conqueror of all. I would also like to present You this sharp, strong '''sword''' and so please accept it. The handle of this sword is bedecked with jewels, and it is extremely powerful.

==Predictions about birth and arrival==

In the cyclic concept of time (''Puranic Kalpa''), [[Kaliyuga]] is variously estimated to last between 400,000 and 432,000 years. In some Vaishnava texts, Kalki is forecasted to appear on a white horse, at the end of Kaliyuga, to end the age of degeneration and to restore virtue and world order.&lt;ref name="coulter2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements, Volume 2|author1=James R.

Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park is an [[industrial symbiosis]] network located in [[Kalundborg]], [[Denmark]], in which companies in the region collaborate to use each other's by-products and otherwise share resources.

The Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park is the first full realization of industrial symbiosis.&lt;ref name=Chertow2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chertow|first=Marian|title=Industrial symbiosis: literature and taxonomy|journal=Annual Review of Energy and the Environment|year=2000|volume=25|pages=313–337|doi=10.1146/annurev.energy.25.1.313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collaboration and its environmental implications arose unintentionally through private initiatives, as opposed to government planning, making it a model for private planning of eco-industrial parks.&lt;ref name=Desrochers /&gt; At the center of the exchange network is the [[Asnæs Power Station]], a 1500MW [[Coal power plant|coal-fired power plant]], which has material and energy links with the community and several other companies.  [[Waste heat|Surplus heat]] from this power plant is used to heat 3500 local homes in addition to a nearby [[fish farm]], whose [[sludge]] is then sold as a [[fertilizer]].  [[Steam]] from the power plant is sold to [[Novo Nordisk]], a [[pharmaceutical]] and [[enzyme]] manufacturer, in addition to [[Statoil]] power plant.  This reuse of [[Waste heat|heat]] reduces the amount [[thermal pollution]] discharged to a nearby [[fjord]].  Additionally, a by-product from the power plant's [[sulfur dioxide]] [[scrubber]] contains [[gypsum]], which is sold to a [[wallboard]] manufacturer.  Almost all of the manufacturer's [[gypsum]] needs are met this way, which reduces the amount of [[open-pit mining]] needed.  Furthermore, [[fly ash]] and [[Clinker (waste)|clinker]] from the power plant is used for road building and [[cement]] production.&lt;ref name="Ehrenfeld"/&gt; These exchanges of waste, water and materials have greatly increased environmental and economic efficiency, as well as created other less tangible benefits for these actors, including sharing of personnel, equipment, and information.&lt;ref name=Chertow2 /&gt;

==History==
The Kalundborg Industrial Park was not originally planned for industrial symbiosis. Its current state of waste heat and materials sharing developed over a period of 20 years. Early sharing at Kalundborg tended to involve the sale of waste products without significant pretreatment.&lt;ref name="Ehrenfeld" /&gt;  Each further link in the system was negotiated as an independent business deal, and was established only if it was expected to be economically beneficial.&lt;ref name="Ehrenfeld" /&gt;

The park began in 1959 with the start up of the [[Asnæs Power Station]]. The first episode of sharing between two entities was in 1972 when Gyproc, a plaster-board manufacturing plant, established a pipeline to supply gas from [[Tidewater Petroleum|Tidewater Oil Company]]. In 1981 the Kalundborg municipality completed a district heating distribution network within the city of Kalundborg, which utilized waste heat from the power plant.&lt;ref name="Industrial Green Book" &gt;National Research Council (1998). The Ecology of Industry: Sector and Linkages. Washington DC: The National Academies Press. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the facilities in Kalundborg have been expanding, and have been sharing a variety of materials and waste products, some for the purpose of industrial symbiosis and some out of necessity, for example,  freshwater scarcity in the area has led to water reuse schemes. In particular, 700,000 cubic meters per year of cooling water is piped from Statoil to Asnaes per year.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt;

A timeline of the creation of the industrial park:
* 1959 The [[Asnæs Power Station]] was started up
* 1961 Tidewater Oil Company constructed a pipeline from [[Tissø|Lake Tissø]] to provide water for its operation
* 1963 Tidewater Oil Company's oil refinery is taken over by [[Esso]]
* 1972 Gyproc establishes plaster-board manufacturing plant. A pipeline from the refinery to the Gyproc facility is constructed to supply excess refinery gas
* 1973 The [[Asnæs Power Station]] is expanded. A connection is built to the Lake Tissø-Statoil pipeline
* 1976 [[Novo Nordisk]] starts delivering biological sludge to neighboring farms
* 1979 [[Asnæs Power Station]] starts supplying [[fly ash]] to cement manufacturers in northern [[Denmark]]
* 1981 the Kalundborg municipality completes a district heating distribution network within the city that utilizes waste heat from the power plant
* 1982 [[Novo Nordisk]] and the [[Statoil]] refinery complete construction of steam supply pipelines from the power plant. By purchasing process steam from the power plant, the companies are able to shut down inefficient steam boilers
* 1987 The [[Statoil]] refinery completes a pipeline to supply its [[effluent]] cooling water to the power plant for use as raw boiler feed water.
* 1989 The power plant starts using waste heat from its salt cooling water to produce trout and turbot at its local fish farm
* 1989 [[Novo Nordisk]] enters into agreement with Kalundborg municipality, the power plant, and the refinery to connect to the water supply grid from Lake Tissø
* 1990 The [[Statoil]] refinery completes construction of a sulphur recovery plant. The recovered sulphur is sold as raw material to a sulfuric acid manufacturer in [[Fredericia]]
* 1991 The [[Statoil]] refinery commissions the building of a pipeline to supply biologically treated refinery [[effluent]] water to the power plant for cleaning purposes, and for [[fly ash]] stabilization
* 1992 The [[Statoil]] refinery commissions the building of a pipeline to supply [[flare gas]] to the power plant as a supplementary fuel
* 1993 The power plant completes a stack [[flue gas]] desulfurization project. The resulting calcium sulphate is sold to Gyproc, where it replaces imported natural [[gypsum]]&lt;ref name="Industrial Green Book" /&gt;

== The Symbiosis ==
The relationships among the firms comprising the Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park form an [[industrial symbiosis]]. Generally speaking, the actors involved in the symbiosis at Kalundborg exchange material wastes, energy, water, and information.&lt;ref name="Domenech &amp; Davies"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Domenech|first=Teresa|author2=Michael Davies|title=Structure and morphology of industrial symbiosis networks: The case of Kalundborg|journal=Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences|year=2011|volume=10|pages=79–89|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.01.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kalundborg network involves a number of actors, including a power station, two big energy firms, a plaster board company, and a soil remediation company. Other actors include farmers, recycling facilities, and fish factories that use some of the material flows.&lt;ref name="Domenech &amp; Davies" /&gt;  [http://www.kalundborg.dk/Erhverv/Erhvervsudvikling/%20Kalundborg_EU-kontor.aspx Kalundborg Municipality] plays an active role. Additionally, other actors, such as Novoren, a recycling and urban land field firm, are formally part of the network but do not contribute
tangibly in the exchange.&lt;ref name="Domenech &amp; Davies" /&gt;

=== Partners ===
[[File:Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park Symbiosis Map.jpg|thumb|A flowchart to show the material sharing between entities in the Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park]]
The Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park today includes nine private and public enterprises, some of which are some of the largest enterprises in Denmark.&lt;ref name="Kalundborg Symbiosis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kalundborg Symbiosis|title=Partners|url=http://www.symbiosis.dk/en/partnere|accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enterprises are:
* [[Novo Nordisk]] - Danish company and largest producer of insulin in the world
* [[Novozymes]] - Danish company and largest enzyme producer in the world
* [http://www.gyproc.ie/ Gyproc] - French producer of gypsum board
* [http://www.kalundborg.dk/Forside.aspx Kalundborg Municipality]
* [[DONG Energy|Dong Energy]] - owner of Asnaes Power Station, the largest power plant in Denmark
* [http://www.rgs90.dk/ RGS 90] - Danish soil remediation and recovery company
* [[Statoil]] - Norwegian company which owns Denmark's largest oil refinery
* [http://www.karanoveren.dk/ Kara/Novoren] - Danish waste treatment company
* [http://www.kalundborgforsyning.dk/ Kalundborg Forsyning A/S] - water and heat supplier, as well as waste disposer, for Kalundborg citizens&lt;ref name="Kalundborg Symbiosis" /&gt;

=== Material Exchanges ===
[[File:Matrix of Kalundborg Exchanges.jpg|thumb|This matrix shows which actors in the Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park interact with each other.]]
There are currently over thirty exchanges of materials among the actors of Kalundborg.&lt;ref name=Municipality&gt;{{cite web|last=Kalundborg Municipality|title=Kalundborg Symbiosis|url= http://www.kalundborg.dk/Erhverv/Erhvervsudvikling/Kalundborg_Symbiosis.aspx |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Asnaes Power Station is at the heart of the network.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehrenfeld|first=John |author2=Nicholas Gertler|title=Industrial Ecology in Practice:  The Evolution of Interdependence at Kalundborg|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|year=1997|volume=1|pages=67–79 |doi=10.1162/jiec.1997.1.1.67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power company gives its steam residuals to the Statoil Refinery, meeting 40% of its steam requirements,&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt; in exchange for waste gas from the refinery. The power plant creates electricity and steam from this gas.&lt;ref name=Desrochers /&gt;  These products are sent to a fish farm and Novo Nordisk, who receive all of their required steam from Asnaes,&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt; and a heating system that supplies 3500 homes.&lt;ref name=Desrochers /&gt; These homeowners pay for the underground piping that supplies their heat, but receive the heat reliably and at a low price.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt; Fly ash from Asnaes is sent to a cement company, and gypsum from its desulfurization process is sent to Gyproc for use in gypsum board.&lt;ref name=Desrochers /&gt; Two-thirds of Gyproc's gypsum needs are met by Asnaes.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt;  Statoil Refinery removes sulfur from its natural gas and sells it to a sulfuric acid manufacturer, Kemira.&lt;ref name=Desrochers /&gt; The fish farm sells sludge from its ponds as fertilizer to nearby farms, and Novo Nordisk gives away its own sludge, of which it produces 3,000 cubic meters per day.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt; The sludge is to be refined for biogas for the power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://ing.dk/artikel/cirkulaer-oekonomi-restaffaldet-enzym-insulinproduktion-skal-baade-bruges-biogas-goedning |title=Restaffaldet fra enzym- og insulinproduktion skal både bruges til biogas og gødning |date=24 March 2017|publisher=[[Ingeniøren]] |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water reuse schemes have also been developed within Kalundborg. Statoil pipes 700,000 cubic meters of cooling water per year to Asnaes, which purifies it and uses it as "boiler feed-water."&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt; Asnaes also uses approximately 200,000 cubic meters of Statoil's treated wastewater per year for cleaning.&lt;ref name=Ehrenfeld /&gt; The 90&amp;nbsp;°C residual heat from the refinery is not used for district heating due to taxes. Instead, [[heat pump]]s are used with the 24&amp;nbsp;°C waste water as a heat reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://ing.dk/artikel/professor-kalundborg-kombiner-spildvarme-varmpepumper-192757 |title=Professor til Kalundborg: Kombinér spildvarme og varmpepumper |date=27 January 2017|publisher=[[Ingeniøren]] |accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Savings and Environmental Impacts==
[[File:Wastes avoided at Kalundborg.jpg|thumbnail|right|Annual wastes avoided in Kalundborg as of 1997]]
[[File:Savings from Kalundborg.jpg|thumbnail|right|Annual resource savings in Kalundborg as of 1997]]

Since its start over 25 years ago, Kalundborg has been operating successfully as an eco-industrial park. One of the main goals of industrial symbiosis is to make goods and services that use the least-cost combination of inputs. These relationships were formed on an economic and environmental basis.&lt;ref name="Desrochers"&gt;Desrochers, Pierre (2001). "Cities and Industrial Symbiosis: Some Historical Perspectives and Policy Implications." Journal of Industrial Ecology 5.4 : 29-44. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, there are over thirty exchanges occurring in Kalundborg. While Kalundborg does operate using trades between various firms in the vicinity, it itself is not self-sufficient or contained to the industrial park. There are many trades that occur with companies outside of this park region.&lt;ref name="Desrochers" /&gt;

All of these exchanges have contributed to water savings, and savings in fuel and input chemicals. Wastes were also avoided through these interchanges. For example, in 1997, Asnaes (the power station) saved 30,000 tons of coal (~2% of throughput) by using Statoil (large oil refinery) fuel gas. And 200,000 tons of fly ash and clinker were avoided from Asnaes landfill.&lt;ref name="Ehrenfeld" /&gt; These resources savings and waste avoidances, documented before 1997, are illustrated in the tables to the right.

A study in 2002 showed that these exchanges also contributed to more than 95% of the total water supply to the power plant. This is up from 70% in 1990.  So, the system is becoming more comprehensive in its ability to save groundwater, however, there is still room for improvement. Out of the 1.2 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of wastewater discharged from Statoil (the refinery), only 9000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; were reused at the power plant.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen"&gt;Jacobsen, Noel Brings (2006). "Industrial Symbiosis in Kalundborg, Denmark: A Quantitative Assessment of Economic and Environmental Aspects." Journal of Industrial Ecology 10.1-2: 239-55. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent numbers show a vast improvement, when comparing to the numbers from 1997, in resource savings. Data from around 2004 show annual savings of 2.9 million cubic meters of ground water, and 1 million cubic meters of surface water. Gypsum savings are estimated around 170,000 tons, and sulfur dioxide waste avoidance is estimated around 53 Tn. These numbers are mostly estimations. Aspects of the eco-industrial park have changed, and there are many levels to consider when doing these calculations. All together though, these interchanges have shown annual savings of up to $15 million (US), with investments around $78.5 million (US). The total accumulated savings is estimated around $310 million (US).&lt;ref name="Domenech &amp; Davies"/&gt;

==As a Model==
Kalundborg was the first example of separate industries grouping together to gain competitive advantage by material exchange, energy exchange, information exchange, and/or product exchange. The very term,  [[Industrial symbiosis|Industrial Symbiosis]] (IS) was first defined by a station manager in Kalundborg as "a cooperation between different industries by which the presence of each…increases the viability of the others, and by which the demands of society for resource savings and environmental protection are considered" .&lt;ref&gt;Chertow, Marian R (2007). ""Uncovering" Industrial Symbiosis." Journal of Industrial Ecology 11.1: 11-30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalundborg's success helped generate interest in industrial symbiosis. Developed nations such as the United States began to formulate incentives for corporations to implement materials exchange with other corporations. Industrial and political circles began to look into the implementation of [[eco-industrial park]]s  (EIPs). Specifically, the United States worked to put into service several planned EIPs. The U.S President's Council on Sustainable Development in 1996 proposed fifteen eco-industrial parks to pursue the idea of industrial symbiosis. These parks were created by grouping diverse stakeholders with common material flows together, with added governmental incentives to encourage materials exchange. The goal of these planned EIPs was to test if the industrial symbiosis that worked so well in Kalundborg could be replicated. The Council on Sustainable Development also defined 5 major characteristics of a successful EIP to help guide EIP development. These characteristics include: (1) some form of material exchange between multiple separate entities, (2) industries within close proximity to each other, (3) cooperation between plant management of the different corporations, (4) an existing infrastructure for material sharing that does not require much retooling, and (5) "anchor" tenants (large corporation with resources to support early implementation). Devens Regional Enterprise Zone is a good example of a successful EIP in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Lowitt, Peter C (2008). "Devens Redevelopment: Emergence of a Successful Eco-Industrial Park in the United States." Journal of Industrial Ecology 12.4: 497-500. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalundborg became an attractive topic in academia as well because of the obvious sustainability advantages of industrial symbiosis. Research conducted on planning and implementation of eco-industrial parks revealed interesting results. Experts argued over the idea of "planned parks" versus "self organized parks". Research showed systematic failure of forced or planned EIPs. Most successful EIPs originate from industrial symbiosis that occurs naturally during industry life, much like the Kalundborg case. This conclusion served to deflate the momentum that the success of Kalundborg generated. Organizations began to recognize the difficulties associated with forcing eco-industrial parks to coalesce and abandoned the idea.

Accessed 10 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- note to English reviewers - the name is not a hoax, see citation provided. --&gt; Kang's activism in civil rights (religious and political freedoms) began in 2003 when he was a student. Kang went on a hunger strike from 11 August to 25 September and from 16 October to 25 October 2004. In 2008, Kang joined a [[peace movement]] and in August 2008, staged a naked protest at the Armed Forces Day of [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/05/117_88230.html "Two conscientious objectors convicted."] ''[[The Korea Times]]'' 2 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Kang became a [[conscientious objector]].

== Biography ==
Kang was born in [[Dongdaemun]] in [[Seoul]], [[Republic of Korea]]. He was educated at the Sungil middle school and the Daekwang high school. Kang was enrolled in the [[Seoul National University]] school of law from March 2005 to 2007 but did not complete his studies.&lt;ref name="Hosik (2011)"/&gt;

== Student activism ==
In 2004, Kang refused to attend his high school chapel services, preferring private worship. On 8 July 2004, Kang was expelled. From 11 August to 25 September 2004, Kang went on an hunger strike, receiving support from some teachers, civic groups and 32 congressmen. Kang returned to school in October 2004 but held a further hunger strike from 17 to 21 October. This won religious rights for students and in taking legal action against his school and the government of [[Seoul]] Kang was compensated.&lt;ref name="Hosik (2011)"/&gt;

As a student of law, Kang promoted the rights of student minorities and on 1 October 2008, made a nude protest against compulsory military service at the 60th Armed Forces Day anniversary parade on Teheran road, Samseong-dongin, Seoul. He ran naked into the parade carrying a gun shaped cookie. He blew on the cookie before eating it. He said,
:"Being nude is a symbol of peace and disarmament. It represents being actively involved in a nonviolent movement for peace. The distribution of gun-shaped cookies implies that a world without arms is sweet and peace is delicious...It would only cost $1.5 trillion to solve worldwide poverty and cure all diseases. We are spending over $1.7 trillion in Korea for our military budget. It caused the killing of innocent citizens in Geochang, Gwangju, and Jeju, and the overthrow of the democratic government of Korea at the same time. Recent military actions include depriving citizens of their homes and taking violent action against candlelit rallies...First I thought recruiting soldiers could be okay. But later I thought we do not need a military system at all."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2013/07/117_32016.html "Activist detained for streaking at military parade."] ''[[The Korea Times]]'' 1 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kang was detained by police and taken to Suseo police station.

=== Conscientious objector ===
In December 2010, Kang received a notice to appear for military duty from the Military Manpower Administration. He refused to attend and was charged with refusing to perform mandatory military duty. Kang commented,
:"Whatever ruling the court comes out with, I have no plan to appeal the decision to a higher court. If it rules against me, I will go to prison and do my time. I think it is worthwhile contemplating what I am going to do after serving my sentence, rather than wasting time by filing an appeal to a higher court...I would like to spend my time in a productive manner. From now on, I will only think about what I am going to do after getting out of jail.”&lt;ref name="Hosik (2011)"/&gt;

Kwon Ki-moon, a judge of the Seoul central district court sentenced Kang to eighteen months in prison for violating the conscription law. Kang was taken to prison immediately after the ruling with his mother watching in the courtroom. The judge said,
:"With the military confrontation between the two Koreas in place, the freedom of conscience can be restricted for the sake of national security.

== Felonious criminal ==
On June 2008, Kang committed a felony over heads and other body parts of policemen and their bus. The Seoul Central District Court ordered a heavy penalty including a heavy fine.&lt;ref name="촛불집회서 `거친 행동' 강의석씨 벌금 600만원"/&gt;

== Prison activist ==
On 14 September and 27 January 2011, Kang began periods of hunger strike of seven days to promote the rights of prisoners. His efforts were interrupted on 8 February 2011 by fainting and hospital admissions.

'''''Lactobacillus delbrueckii'' subsp. ''bulgaricus''''' (until 2014 known as '''''Lactobacillus bulgaricus''''') is the main [[bacteria]] used for the production of [[yogurt]]. It is also found in other naturally fermented products.  First identified in 1905 by the [[Bulgarian people|Bulgarian]] doctor [[Stamen Grigorov]], the bacterium feeds on [[lactose]] to produce [[lactic acid]], which is used to preserve milk.

''Lactobacillus delbrueckii'' subsp. ''bulgaricus'' can be found naturally in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals living in Bulgaria, but one specific strain, [[Lactobacillus bulgaricus GLB44|''Lactobacillus bulgaricus'' GLB44]], is extracted from the leaves of the ''[[Galanthus nivalis]]'' (snowdrop flower) in Bulgaria as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The bacterium is also grown artificially in many other countries.

It is a [[gram-positive]] rod that may appear long and filamentous. It is [[motility|non-motile]] and does not form spores. It is regarded as aciduric or [[Acidophile (organisms)|acidophilic]], since it requires a low [[pH]] (around 5.4–4.6) to grow effectively. The bacterium has complex nutritional requirements.

On October 18, 2012, during the International Conference on "Biodiversity Conservation and Education for Sustainable Development - Learning to Conserve Biodiversity in a Rapidly Changing World" held at Hyderabad during CoP-11, [[Jayanthi Natarajan]], India's Minister of State for Environment and Forests, announced it as the National Microbe for India. The microbe was selected by children who had visited the [[Science Express]] Biodiversity Special, a train which has been visiting various stations across the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://southasia.oneworld.net/news/now-india-has-a-national-microbe&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in industry ==

''Lactobacillus delbrueckii ''subsp.'' bulgaricus'' is commonly used alongside  ''[[Streptococcus thermophilus]]''&lt;ref name="courtin"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Courtin | first1 = P. | last2 = Rul | first2 = F.

The two species work in synergy, with ''L. d. bulgaricus'' producing amino acids from milk proteins, which are then used by ''S. thermophilus''.&lt;ref name="courtin" /&gt; Both species produce [[lactic acid]],&lt;ref name="courtin" /&gt; which gives yogurt its tart flavor and acts as a preservative. The resulting decrease in pH also partially coagulates the milk proteins, such as casein, resulting in yogurt's thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicinalfoodnews.com/vol01/issue5/kalab.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220050730/http://medicinalfoodnews.com/vol01/issue5/kalab.htm |archivedate=2010-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zourari"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zourari | first1 = A. | last2 = Accolas | first2 = J.

Some of the biggest importers&lt;!-- (from where?) --&gt; of the bacterium are [[Japan]], the [[United States]], and the [[European Union]].

It has also been considered a contaminant of beer due to its homofermentative production of lactic acid, an off-flavor in many styles of beer. In other styles of beer, however, lactic acid bacteria can contribute to the overall appearance, aroma, taste, and/or mouthfeel, and generally produce an otherwise pleasing sourness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Priest|first=FG|title=Brewing Microbiology|year=2002|publisher=Springer|pages=185–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|History of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus}} History ==

''Lactobacillus delbrueckii'' subsp. ''bulgaricus'' was first identified in 1905 by [[Stamen Grigorov]], who named it ''Bacillus bulgaricus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stamengrigorov.org/?current=science&amp;lang=en&amp;id_sess=0ed3jl08q0028tbboq1imdmta1 | title = Dr Stamen Grigorov Foundation | accessdate = 2013-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ilya Metchnikoff]], a professor at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Paris, researched the relationship between the longevity of [[Bulgarians]] and their consumption of yogurt. He had the idea that aging is caused by putrefactive activity, or [[proteolysis]], by microbes that produce toxic substances in the intestine.

Proteolytic bacteria such as [[clostridia]], which are part of the normal intestinal flora, produce toxic substances including [[phenols]], [[ammonia]] and [[indol]]s by digestion of [[protein]]s. These compounds are responsible for what Metchnikoff called ''intestinal auto-intoxication'', which, according to him, was the cause of the physical changes associated with old age, a concept that has no scientific basis. It was already known at that time that fermentation with [[lactic acid bacteria]] inhibits the deterioration of milk because of its low [[pH]].

Metchnikoff's research also noted that rural populations in [[Southeastern Europe]] and the Russian steppes daily consume milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and live relatively longer than other populations. Based on these data Metchnikoff proposed that consumption of fermented milk seeds the intestine with harmless lactic acid bacteria increasing intestinal acidity and suppressing the growth of proteolytic bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mail.successmakers.com/uploads/Probiotics_-_100_years_after_Elie_Metchnikoff_PhDs_Obsevations.pdf |title=Probiotics: 100 years (1907–2007) after Elie Metchnikoff's Observation |accessdate=2013-01-08 |first=Kingsley C. |last=Anukam |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004072755/http://mail.successmakers.com/uploads/Probiotics_-_100_years_after_Elie_Metchnikoff_PhDs_Obsevations.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14336">In [[psychology]] ''and'' [[cognitive science]], a '''memory bias''' is a [[cognitive bias]] that either enhances or impairs the recall of a [[memory]] (either the chances that the memory will be recalled at all, or the amount of time it takes for it to be recalled, or both), or that alters the content of a reported memory. There are many different types of memory biases, including:

* '''[[Boundary extension]]''': remembering the background of an image as being larger or more expansive than the foreground
* '''Change bias''': after an investment of effort in producing change, remembering one's past performance as more difficult than it actually was.&lt;ref name="schacter" /&gt;
* '''[[Childhood amnesia]]''': the retention of few memories from before the age of four.
* '''[[Choice-supportive bias]]''': remembering chosen options as having been better than rejected options (Mather, Shafir &amp; Johnson, 2000)
* '''[[Confirmation bias]]''': the tendency to search for, interpret, or recall information in a way that confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses.
* '''Conservatism''' or '''Regressive bias''': tendency to remember high values and high likelihoods/probabilities/frequencies lower than they actually were and low ones higher than they actually were. Based on the evidence, memories are not extreme enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Attneave | first1 = F | year = 1953 | title = Psychological probability as a function of experienced frequency | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 81–86 | pmid=13084849 | doi=10.1037/h0057955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischhoff | first1 = B. | last2 = Slovic | first2 = P. | last3 = Lichtenstein | first3 = S. | year = 1977 | title = Knowing with certainty: The appropriateness of extreme confidence | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 552–564 | doi = 10.1037/0096-1523.3.4.552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Consistency bias''': incorrectly remembering one's past attitudes and behaviour as resembling present attitudes and behaviour.
* '''[[cue-dependent forgetting|Context effect]]''': that [[cognition]] and memory are dependent on context, such that out-of-context memories are more difficult to retrieve than in-context memories (e.g., recall time and accuracy for a work-related memory will be lower at home, and vice versa).
* '''[[Cryptomnesia]]''': a form of ''misattribution'' where a memory is mistaken for imagination, because there is no subjective experience of it being a memory.&lt;ref name="schacter"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schacter|first= Daniel L. |year=1999|title=The Seven Sins of Memory: Insights From Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience|journal=American Psychologist|volume=54|issue=3 |pages=182–203|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.3.182|pmid=10199218}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Egocentric bias]]''': recalling the past in a self-serving manner, e.g., remembering one's exam grades as being better than they were, or remembering a caught fish as bigger than it really was.
* '''[[Fading affect bias]]''': a bias in which the emotion associated with unpleasant memories fades more quickly than the emotion associated with positive events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker |first=W. Richard |author2=John J. Skowronski |author3=Charles P. Thompson |year=2003 |title=Life Is Pleasant—and Memory Helps to Keep It That Way! |journal=Review of General Psychology |publisher=Educational Publishing Foundation |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=203–210 |url=http://www.apa.org/journals/releases/gpr72203.pdf |accessdate=2009-08-27 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.7.2.203 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124181254/http://www.apa.org/journals/releases/gpr72203.pdf |archivedate=January 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Generation effect]] (Self-generation effect)''': that self-generated information is remembered best. For instance, people are better able to recall memories of statements that they have generated than similar statements generated by others.
*'''[[Gender differences in eyewitness memory]]''': the tendency for a witness to remember more details about someone of the same gender.
* '''[[Hindsight bias]]''': the inclination to see past events as being predictable; also called the "I-knew-it-all-along" effect.
* '''Humor effect''': that humorous items are more easily remembered than non-humorous ones, which might be explained by the distinctiveness of humor, the increased cognitive processing time to understand the humor, or the emotional arousal caused by the humor.
* '''[[Illusory truth effect|Illusion-of-truth effect]]''': that people are more likely to identify as true statements those they have previously heard (even if they cannot consciously remember having heard them), regardless of the actual validity of the statement. In other words, a person is more likely to believe a familiar statement than an unfamiliar one.
* '''[[Illusory correlation]]''': inaccurately seeing a relationship between two events related by coincidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fiedler | first1 = K | year = 1991 | title = The tricky nature of skewed frequency tables: An information loss account of distinctiveness-based illusory correlations | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = 1| pages = 24–36 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.60.1.24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Lag effect''': see [[spacing effect]].
* '''[[Leveling and sharpening]]''': memory distortions introduced by the loss of details in a recollection over time, often concurrent with sharpening or selective recollection of certain details that take on exaggerated significance in relation to the details or aspects of the experience lost through leveling. Both biases may be reinforced over time, and by repeated recollection or re-telling of a memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koriat |first=A. |author2=M. Goldsmith |author3=A.

* '''[[Levels-of-processing effect]]''': that different methods of encoding information into memory have different levels of effectiveness (Craik &amp; Lockhart, 1972).
* '''[[List-length effect]]''': a smaller percentage of items are remembered in a longer list, but as the length of the list increases, the absolute number of items remembered increases as well.
* '''[[Memory inhibition]]''': that being shown some items from a list makes it harder to retrieve the other items (e.g., Slamecka, 1968).
* '''[[Misattribution of memory]]''': when information is retained in memory but the source of the memory is forgotten. One of Schacter's (1999) [[seven sins of memory]], misattribution was divided into source confusion, cryptomnesia and false recall/false recognition.&lt;ref name="schacter" /&gt;
* '''[[Misinformation effect]]''': that misinformation affects people's reports of their own memory.
* '''[[Modality effect]]''': that memory recall is higher for the last items of a list when the list items were received via speech than when they were received via writing.
* '''Mood congruent memory bias''': the improved recall of information congruent with one's current mood.
* '''Next-in-line effect''': that a person in a group has diminished recall for the words of others who spoke immediately before or after this person.
* '''[[Peak-end rule]]''': that people seem to perceive not the sum or average of an experience, but how it was at its peak (e.g. pleasant or unpleasant) and how it ended.
* '''Persistence''': the unwanted recurrence of memories of a [[Psychological trauma|traumatic event]].
* '''[[Picture superiority effect]]''': that concepts are much more likely to be remembered experientially if they are presented in picture form than if they are presented in word form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first= D.

* '''[[Reminiscence bump]]''': the recalling of more personal events from adolescence and early adulthood than personal events from other lifetime periods (Rubin, Wetzler &amp; Nebes, 1986; Rubin, Rahhal &amp; Poon, 1998).
* '''[[Rosy retrospection]]''': the remembering of the past as having been better than it really was.
* '''Saying is Believing effect''': Communicating a socially tuned message to an audience can lead to a bias of identifying the tuned message as one's own thoughts.
* '''[[Self-Reference Effect|Self-reference effect]]''': the phenomena that memories encoded with relation to the self are better recalled than similar information encoded otherwise.
* '''[[Self-serving bias]]''': perceiving oneself responsible for desirable outcomes but not responsible for undesirable ones.
* '''[[Misattribution of memory#Source confusion|Source confusion]]''': misattributing the source of a memory, e.g. misremembering that one saw an event personally when actually it was seen on television.
* '''[[Spacing effect]]''': that information is better recalled if exposure to it is repeated over a longer span of time.
* '''Stereotypical bias''': memory distorted towards [[stereotype]]s (e.g. racial or gender), e.g. "black-sounding" names being misremembered as names of criminals.&lt;ref name="schacter" /&gt;
* '''[[Subadditivity effect]]''': the tendency to estimate that the likelihood of a remembered event is less than the sum of its (more than two) mutually exclusive components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tversky | first1 = A. | last2 = Koehler | first2 = D.

* '''Suffix effect''': the weakening of the recency effect in the case that an item is appended to the list that the subject is ''not'' required to recall (Morton, Crowder &amp; Prussin, 1971).
* '''[[Suggestibility]]''': a form of misattribution where ideas suggested by a questioner are mistaken for memory.
* '''[[Telescoping effect]]''': the tendency to displace recent events backward in time and remote events forward in time, so that recent events appear more remote, and remote events, more recent.
* '''[[Testing effect]]''': that frequent testing of material that has been committed to memory improves memory recall.
* '''[[Tip of the tongue]]''': when a subject is able to recall parts of an item, or related information, but is frustratingly unable to recall the whole item. This is thought to be an instance of "blocking" where multiple similar memories are being recalled and interfere with each other.&lt;ref name="schacter" /&gt;

An '''unusual unit of measurement''' is a [[unit of measurement]] that does not form part of a coherent [[systems of measurement|system of measurement]]; especially in that its exact quantity may not be well known or that it may be an inconvenient multiple or fraction of base units in such systems. This definition is deliberately not exact since it might seem to encompass units such as the week or the [[light-year]] which are quite "usual" in the sense they are often used; if they are used out of context, they may be "unusual", as demonstrated by the [[FFF system|Furlong/Firkin/Fortnight (FFF)]] system of units. Many of the unusual units of measurements listed here are colloquial measurements, units devised to compare a measurement to common and familiar objects.

==Length==
===Rack unit===
[[File:Server rack rail dimensions.svg|thumb|upright|A typical section of rack rail, showing rack unit distribution.]]
{{Main article|Rack unit}}
One rack unit (U) is {{convert|1.75|in|2}} and is used to measure rack-mountable audiovisual and computing equipment (hence, 24000U = 1 [[Verst]].) Rack units are typically denoted without a space between the number of units and the 'U'. Thus a 4U [[server (computing)|server]] enclosure (case) is {{convert|7|in|1|spell=in}} high.

===Hand===
{{main article|Hand (unit)}}
The '''hand''' is a non-[[SI]] unit of length equal to exactly {{convert|4|in|mm|1}}. It is normally used to measure the height of horses in some English-speaking countries, including Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equestrian.org.au/site/equestrian/national/downloads/content/attachments/rules/02%20Mch-Nat%20Measuring%20Rules.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826125716/http://www.equestrian.org.au/site/equestrian/national/downloads/content/attachments/rules/02%20Mch-Nat%20Measuring%20Rules.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-08-26 |title=Equestrian Federation of Australia National Measuring Scheme Effective from 1 January 2002 and amended in March 2002 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=March 2002 |website=www.equestrian.org.au/ |publisher=Equestrian Federation of Australia |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States.

===Smoot===
{{main article|Smoot}}
The '''smoot'''  is a nonstandard, humorous unit of length created as part of an MIT fraternity prank. It is named after Oliver R. Smoot, a fraternity pledge to Lambda Chi Alpha, who in October 1958 lay down repeatedly on the Harvard Bridge (between Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts) so that his fraternity brothers could use his height{{Snd}} {{Convert|67|in|m}}{{Snd}} to measure the length of the bridge (it was 364.4 Smoots, plus or minus an ear)&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light-nanosecond===
{{See also|Light-foot}}
The light-nanosecond was popularized as a unit of distance by [[Grace Hopper]] as the distance which a photon could travel in one billionth of a second (roughly 30 [[centimetre|cm]] or one [[foot (unit)|foot]]): "The [[speed of light]] is one foot per nanosecond."&lt;ref&gt;The exact length is 29.9792458 cm.&lt;/ref&gt; In her speaking engagements, she was well known for passing out light-nanoseconds of wire to the audience, and contrasting it with light-microseconds (a coil of wire 1,000 times as long) and light-picoseconds (the size of ground [[black pepper]]). Over the course of her life, she found many uses for this visual aid, including demonstrating the waste of sub-optimal programming, illustrating advances in computer speed, and simply giving young scientists and policy makers the ability to conceptualize the magnitude of very large and small numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/tap/Files/hopper-story.html |title=Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper|date=4 May 2006 |publisher=US Navy|accessdate=2006-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metric foot===
A [[metric foot]] (defined as 300&amp;nbsp;mm, or about 11.8 inches) has been used occasionally in the UK&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvstudiohistory.co.uk/tv%20centre%20history.htm ''"Measurements are in metric feet (30cm)..."''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220032259/http://www.tvstudiohistory.co.uk/tv%20centre%20history.htm |date=20 December 2014 }} [[BBC Television Centre]] plans&lt;/ref&gt; but has never been an official unit.

===Horse===
{{main article|Horse length}}
Horses are used to measure distances in [[horse racing]] – a ''horse length'' (shortened to merely a ''length'' when the context makes it obvious) equals roughly {{convert|8|ft|m|1|abbr=off|disp=or}}. Shorter distances are measured in fractions of a ''horse length''; also common are measurements of a full or fraction of a ''head'', a ''neck'', or a ''nose''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.spreadex.com/sports/get-started/horse-racing-spread-betting/winning-distances/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boat length===
In rowing races such as the [[Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race]], the margin of victory and of defeat is expressed in fractions and multiples of ''lengths''. The length of a [[Eight (rowing)|rowing eight]] is about {{convert|62|ft|m}}. A shorter distance is the ''[[Glossary of rowing terms#canvas|canvas]]'', which is the length of the covered part of the boat between the bow and the bow oarsman.

===Football field (length)===
An [[American football field]] is usually understood to be {{convert|100|yd|m}} long, though it is technically {{convert|120|yd|m|1}} when including the two {{convert|10|yd|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} long end zones. The field is {{convert|160|ft|yd m|abbr=on}} wide. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2015-nfl-rulebook#rule-1.-the-field|title=2015 NFL Rulebook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Canadian football field]] is {{convert|65|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on}} long, including two {{convert|20|yd|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} long end zones.

Media in the UK also use the [[association football pitch|football pitch]] as a unit of length, although the area of the [[association football]] pitch is not fixed, but may vary within limits of {{convert|90|-|120|m|yd|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|45|-|90|m|yd|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} in width. The usual size of a football pitch is {{convert|105|x|68|m|yd|abbr=on}}, the dimensions used for matches in the [[UEFA Champions League]].

===Block===
A [[city block]] (in most US cities) is between {{convert|1/16|and|1/8|mi|m|abbr=on}}. In [[Manhattan]], the measurement "block" usually refers to a north-south block, which is  {{convert|1/20|mi|m|abbr=on}}. Sometimes people living in cities with a regularly spaced street grid will speak of ''long blocks'' and ''short blocks''. Within a typical large North American city, it is often only possible to travel along east-west and north-south streets, so travel distance between two points is often given in the number of blocks east-west plus the number north-south (known to mathematicians as the ''[[taxicab geometry|Manhattan Metric]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html|title=Manhattan distance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tall buildings===
[[File:Empire State Building from the Top of the Rock.jpg|thumb|upright|The Empire State Building is taller than 4 American football fields stood on end, including their end zones.]]
{{See also|List of tallest buildings and structures in the world}}
Throughout the world, well-known tall structures such as the [[Empire State Building]] ({{convert|449|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are often used as comparative measurements of height.

In the UK, well-known structures such as the [[Blackpool Tower]] ({{convert|158|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-395145/Nelson-facelift-loses-16ft.html|title=Nelson has a facelift but loses 16ft|website=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; are commonly used by British newspapers or reference books to give the comparative heights of buildings or, occasionally, mountains.

In Canada, the Toronto [[CN Tower]] ({{convert|553|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is used as a unit of length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628004821/http://routesonthered.ca/pdf/lake_agassiz.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=28 June 2006|website=archive.org|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccnmatthews.com/news/releases/show.jsp?action=showRelease&amp;actionFor=528581&amp;searchText=false&amp;showText=all|title=Computer Recycling and Donating, Electronic Recycling Association Expands its Operations|website=Marketwire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the [[Eiffel Tower]] and [[Mont Saint-Michel]] are commonly used as units of height or volume. The [[Tour Montparnasse|Montparnasse Tower]] (Paris) is also – but less – used as a measurement for modern buildings, mostly in Parisian Area.

===The Earth's circumference===
The circumference of a [[great circle]] of the [[Earth]] (about {{convert|40,000|km|mi nmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is often compared to large distances. For example, one might say that a large number of objects laid end-to-end at the equator "would circle the Earth four and a half times".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D7153FF934A3575AC0A96F948260|title=Enough Burnt Sienna to Circle the Globe|date=7 September 1989|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[World Geodetic System|WGS-84]], the circumference of a circle through the poles (twice the length of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]) is {{convert|40,007,862.917|m|yd}} and the length of the [[equator]] is {{convert|40,075,016.686|m|yd}}. Despite the fact that the difference (0.17%) between the two is insignificant at the low precision that these quantities are typically given to, it is nevertheless often specified as being at the equator.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The definitions of both the [[nautical mile]] and the [[kilometre]] were originally derived from the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. The nautical mile was defined as a [[minute of arc]] of [[latitude]] measured along any meridian. A circle has 360 degrees, and each degree is 60 minutes, so the nautical mile was defined as {{frac|1|21,600}} of the Earth's circumference, or about 1,852.22 [[metre]]s. However, by international agreement, it is now defined to be exactly {{convert|1,852|m|ft}}.

The metre was originally defined as {{frac|1|10,000,000}} of the distance from a pole to the equator, or as {{frac|1|40,000,000}} of the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. This standard made the historical metre 0.0197% longer than the modern standard metre, which is calculated based on the distance covered by light in a vacuum in a set amount of time.

===Earth-to-Moon distance===
The distance between the Earth's and the Moon's surfaces is, on average, approximately {{convert|380,000|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=or}}. This distance is sometimes used in the same manner as the circumference of the Earth; that is, one might say that a large number of objects laid end-to-end "would reach all the way to the Moon and back two-and-a-half times".

The abbreviation for the Earth-to-Moon distance is "LD" which stands for "[[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Lunar Distance]]," used in astronomy to express close approaches of Earth by [[minor planet]]s.

===Siriometer===
The [[siriometer]] is a rarely used astronomical measure equal to one million [[astronomical unit]]s, i.e., one million times the average distance between the Sun and Earth. This distance is equal to about 15.8&amp;nbsp;[[light-year]]s, 149.6&amp;nbsp;[[peta-|P]]m or 4.8&amp;nbsp;[[parsec]]s, and is about twice the distance from Earth to the star [[Sirius]].&lt;!--Google test prefers US spelling--&gt;

==Area==
===Barn===
{{Main article|Barn (unit)}}
One barn is 10&lt;sup&gt;−28&lt;/sup&gt; square metres, about the cross-sectional area of a uranium nucleus. The name probably derives from early neutron-deflection experiments, when the uranium nucleus was described, and the phrases "big as a barn" and "hit a barn door" were used.

===Brass===
One brass is {{convert|100|ft2|sigfig=3}} area (used in measurement of work done or to be done, such as plastering, painting, etc.). It is also equal, however, to {{convert|100|ft3|sigfig=3}} of estimated or supplied loose material, such as sand, gravel, rubble, etc. This unit is prevalent in construction industry in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gardentia.net/chart/|title=Chart|author=|date=|website=gardentia.net|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/mumbai-builders-hit-sand-trap-110021200018_1.html|title=Mumbai builders hit sand trap|first=Sanjay|last=Jog|date=12 February 2010|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2018|via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Square===
The ''[[square (unit)|square]]'' is an [[Imperial units|Imperial unit]] of [[area]] that is used in the construction industry in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031018185707/http://www.p1m.com/um.htm|title=Units of Measurements|author=|date=18 October 2003|website=archive.org|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was historically used in [[Australia]] by real estate agents. One square is equal to {{convert|100|sqft|m2|2|lk=on}}. A [[roof]]'s area may be calculated in square feet, then converted to squares.

===Cow's grass===
In Ireland, before the 19th Century, a "cow's grass" was a measurement used by farmers to indicate the size of their fields. A cow's grass was equal to the amount of land that could produce enough grass to support a cow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelly|first=John|title=The Graves are Walking: The Great Famine and Saga of the Irish People|page=15|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co.|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=c9A9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=a+%22cow's+grass%22+ireland#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cow's%20grass%22&amp;f=false|title=Letters on the Condition of the People of Ireland|last=Foster|first=Thomas Campbell|date=1846|publisher=Chapman and Hall|language=en|quote=The land is not let by the acre, but by what is termed a “cow's grass” — so many “cows' grass” to a farm.

A variation called a "cow field"{{clarify|reason=How big is a cow field, in standard units?|date=April 2016}} is still often used in the [[Channel Islands]], particularly [[Guernsey]], where classified advertisements in the local newspaper ([[Guernsey Press]]) for land can be seen referring to "A plot of land measuring X cow fields." This is probably still used because an acre of land in Guernsey is rather unusual due to the small size of the island and therefore a cow-field is a more suitable unit of measurement.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Morgen===
{{Main article|Morgen}}
A [[morgen]] ("morning" in Dutch and German) was approximately the amount of land tillable by one man behind an ox in the morning hours of a day. This was an official unit of measurement in South Africa until the 1970s, and was defined in November 2007 by the South African Law Society as having a conversion factor of 1 Morgen = {{val|0.856532|u=hectare}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Countries, regions, and cities===
[[File:British Isles United Kingdom WA highlighted.svg|thumb|upright|Wales (red) in the UK (pink)]]
The area of a familiar country, state or city is often used as a unit of measure, especially in [[journalism]].

====Wales====
Equal to 20,779&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (8,023&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi), the country of [[Wales]] is used in phrases such as "an area the size of Wales" or "twice the area of Wales".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_west/4543070.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Wales - South West Wales - Expat joins Falklands council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5184332.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Science/Nature - Diary: The Amazon rainforest|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[England]] is 6.275 times the size of Wales, and Scotland is roughly four times the size of Wales. [[Ireland]] is four times larger than Wales, and [[France]] is about twenty-five times larger.

In older British and Commonwealth atlases, it was common to show a known area at the same scale, and the usual area to show was either Wales for smaller scales, or Great Britain for larger areas.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The British comedy show ''[[The Eleven O'Clock Show]]'' parodied the use of this measurement, by introducing a news article about an earthquake in Wales, stating that an area the size of Wales was affected. The Radio 4 programme ''More or Less'' introduced the idea of "kilowales"&amp;nbsp;– an area 1,000 times the size of Wales. ''[[The Register]]'' introduced the nanowales (20.78 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Haines|first=Lester|title=So, what's the velocity of a sheep in a vacuum?|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/24/vulture_central_standards/?page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114110120/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/24/vulture_central_standards/?page=2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 November 2013|publisher=The Register|date=24 August 2007|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The United States====
In the United States the area of the smallest state, [[Rhode Island]] ({{convert|1,545|sqmi|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the largest of the contiguous 48 states, [[Texas]] ({{convert|268601|sqmi|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}), and, less commonly, [[Alaska]] ({{convert|656425|sqmi|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}) are used in a similar fashion. [[Antarctica]]'s [[Larsen Ice Shelf|Larsen B ice shelf]] was approximately the size of Rhode Island until it broke up in 2002. In the 1979 movie ''[[The China Syndrome]]'', radiation is expected to contaminate "an area the size of [[Pennsylvania]]". Any state may be used in this fashion to describe the area of another country.

The US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] uses [[Washington, D.C.]] ({{convert|61.4|sqmi|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}) as a comparison for city-sized objects.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Other countries====
In the Netherlands, its smallest province, [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] ({{convert|1386|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}), is often used as a comparison for regions in general.

The country of [[Belgium]] ({{convert|30528|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) has also often been used when comparing areas, to the point where it has been regarded as a [[meme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris |last=Edwards |title=Quizzical: this month, Chris Edwards tackles temperature extremes, the size of Belgium, categorising nations' development status, the hydrogen bombs dropped on Japan and the number of people who speak Scottish Gaelic |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3120/is_8_77/ai_n29198390/ |work=[[Geographical (magazine)|Geographical]] |date=August 2005 |accessdate=20 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413081725/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3120/is_8_77/ai_n29198390/ |archivedate=13 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and where there is a [http://www.sizeofbelgium.com/ website] dedicated to notable areas which have been compared to that of Belgium.

The [[Isle of Wight]] ({{convert|380|km2|sqmi|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}), an island off the south coast of mainland [[England]], is commonly used to define smaller areas.

In [[Denmark]], the island of [[Bornholm]] (588 square kilometers) is often used to describe the size of an area.

In Germany, the [[Saarland]] ({{convert|2569.69|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) is often used to define areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/article6452153/Das-Saarland-das-Vergleichsmass-vieler-Dinge.html|title=Größenordnungen: Das Saarland – das Vergleichsmaß vieler Dinge - DIE WELT|author=Marco Krefting|date=18 February 2010|website=DIE WELT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], it is common to compare relatively small areas to the state of [[Sergipe]] ({{convert|21910.4|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the smallest in the country. Smaller areas are sometimes compared to the cities of [[São Paulo]] ({{convert|1521.11|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) or [[Rio de Janeiro]] ({{convert|1221|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}).

==Volume==
&lt;!-- Please keep these sorted in ascending order, smallest volume first --&gt;

===Metric ounce===
A metric ounce is an approximation of the imperial ounce, US dry ounce, or US fluid ounce. These three customary units vary. However, the metric ounce is usually taken as 25 or 30&amp;nbsp;ml when volume is being measured, or grams when mass is being measured.

The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) defines the "food labeling ounce" as 30&amp;nbsp;ml, slightly larger than the 29.6&amp;nbsp;ml [[fluid ounce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2004/aprqtr/21cfr101.9.htm |title=Food and Drugs: FDA Food Labeling |date=1 April 2004 |publisher=[[US Government Printing Office]]}}&lt;br/&gt;For [[Nutrition facts label]]ing "a teaspoon means 5 milliliters (ml), a tablespoon means 15 ml, a cup means 240 ml, 1 fl oz means 30 ml, and 1 oz in weight means 28 g".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shot===
{{Main article|Shot glass}}
[[File:Three shotglasses.jpg|thumb|right|Three shot glasses of varying shape and size]]
The [[shot glass|shot]] is a liquid volume measure that varies from country to country and state to state depending on legislation. It is routinely used for measuring strong [[liquor]] or spirits when the amount served and consumed is smaller than the more common measures of alcoholic "drink" and "pint". There is a legally defined maximum size of a serving in some jurisdictions. The size of a "single" shot is {{convert|20|-|60|ml|abbr=on}}. The smaller "pony" shot is {{convert|20|-|30|ml|abbr=on}}. According to Encyclopædia Britannica Almanac 2009, a pony is 0.75 [[fluid ounce]]s{{clarify|date=September 2014|reason=Imperial fluid ounces, US fluid ounces, or something else?}} of liquor.&lt;ref name="BritannicaAlmanac"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Almanac 2009|date=2009|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|isbn=978-1593398392|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nxLkMspauIC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=Spirits+Measure|editor=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.

===Board foot or super foot===
{{Main article|Board foot}}
A board foot is a United States and Canadian unit of volume, used for lumber. It is equivalent to {{nowrap|1 inch × 1 foot × 1 foot}} ({{convert|144|cuin|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}). It is also found in the unit of density ''pounds per board foot''. In Australia and New Zealand the terms ''super foot'' or ''superficial foot'' were formerly used for this unit.

===Hoppus foot===
{{details|Hoppus}}
A system of measure for timber in the round (standing or felled), now largely superseded by the metric system except in measuring hardwoods in certain countries. Its purpose is to estimate the value of sawn timber in a log, by measuring the unsawn log and allowing for wastage in the mill. Following the so-called "quarter-girth formula" (the square of one quarter of the circumference in inches multiplied by {{frac|1|144}} of the length in feet), the notional log is four feet in circumference, one inch of which yields the hoppus board foot, 1 foot yields the hoppus foot, and 50 feet yields a hoppus ton. This translates to a hoppus foot being equal to {{convert|1.273|ft3|in3 m3}}. The hoppus board foot, when milled, yields about one [[board foot]]. The volume yielded by the quarter-girth formula is 78.54% of cubic measure (i.e. 1&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.7854&amp;nbsp;h&amp;nbsp;ft; 1&amp;nbsp;h&amp;nbsp;ft = 1.273&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="forest mensuration"&gt;{{cite book |last= Husch |first= Bertram |author2=Thomas W.

===Cubic ton===
{{Main article|Cubic ton}}
A cubic ton is an antiquated measure of volume, varying based on the commodity from about {{convert|16|to|45|ft3|m3|abbr=on}}. It is now only used for lumber, for which one cubic ton is equivalent to {{convert|40|ft3|m3|abbr=on}}.

===Cord and rick===
[[File:Cord of wood.jpg|thumb|A cord of wood]]
{{Main article|Cord (unit)}}
The cord is a unit of measure of [[dry measure|dry volume]] used in Canada and the United States to measure [[firewood]] and [[pulpwood]]. A cord is the amount of wood that, when "ranked and well stowed" (arranged so pieces are aligned, parallel, touching and compact), occupies a volume of {{convert|128|cuft|m3|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=British Columbia Ministry of Forests and Range|title=Glossary of Forestry Terms in British Columbia|url=http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/library/documents/glossary/Glossary.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This corresponds to a well-stacked woodpile, 4 feet deep by 4 feet high by 8 feet wide {{nowrap|(122 cm × 122 cm × 244 cm)}}, or any other arrangement of linear measurements that yields the same volume. A more unusual measurement for firewood is the "rick" or [[face cord]]. It is stacked {{convert|16|in|cm|sigfig=3}} deep with the other measurements kept the same as a cord, making it {{frac|3}} of a cord; however, regional variations mean that its precise definition is nonstandardized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictR.html How Many? A Dictionary of Units of Measurement], Russ Rowlett and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty-foot equivalent unit===
{{main article|Twenty-foot equivalent unit}}
The twenty-foot equivalent unit is the volume of the smallest standard [[intermodal container|shipping container]]. It is equivalent to {{convert|1360|cuft|m3}}. Larger intermodal containers are commonly described in multiples of TEU, as are container ship capacities.

===Double decker bus===
The approximate volume of a [[double-decker bus]], abbreviated to DDB, has been used informally to describe the size of hole created by a major sewer collapse. For example, a report might refer to "a 4 DDB hole".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8wpnoExCJOcC&amp;dq=sewer+collapse+ddb |title=Sewers : Repair and Renovation|publisher= Butterworth-Heinemann|author=Geoffrey F Read, Ian Vickridge eds.|date=24 December 1996|accessdate=29 June 2016|isbn=978-0080541129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acre-foot===
{{Main article|Acre-foot}}
An acre-foot is a unit of volume commonly used in the United States in reference to large-scale water resources, such as reservoirs, aqueducts, canals, sewer flow capacity, irrigation water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NM OSE Glossary|url=http://www.ose.state.nm.us/water_info_glossary.html#A|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051114202301/http://www.ose.state.nm.us/water_info_glossary.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 November 2005|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and river flows. It is defined by the volume of one acre of surface area to a depth of one foot (43,560&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) which is about {{convert|1233.48|m3|usgal impgal|abbr=on}}.

===Olympic-size swimming pool===
[[File:Olympic Swimming Pool - Fast Lane.JPG|thumb|An Olympic-size swimming pool holds over 2 acre-feet of water.]]
For larger volumes of liquid, one measure commonly used in the media in many countries is the [[Olympic-size swimming pool]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hudson: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/paulhudson/2010/06/3rd-anniversary-of-july-2007-f.shtml 3rd anniversary of June 2007 floods], showing a storm water storage tank "half the size of an Olympic swimming pool"&lt;/ref&gt; A {{convert|50|×|25|m|abbr=on}} Olympic swimming pool, built to the FR3 minimum depth of {{convert|2|m|ft|1}} would hold {{convert|2,500|m3|l impgal USgal acre·ft|abbr=on}}.

===Sydney Harbour===
[[File:Sydney(from air) V2.jpg|thumb|Sydney Harbour ([[Port Jackson]]), contains enough water to fill the Melbourne Cricket Ground 357 times or about 238,000 Olympic swimming pools.]]
A unit of volume used in Australia for water. One Sydney Harbour, also called a ''Sydharb (or sydarb)'', is the amount of water in [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]]: approximately 562 gigalitres (562,000,000 cubic metres, or 0.562 of a cubic [[kilometre]]); or in terms of the more unusual measures above, about 357 [[#Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne Cricket Grounds]], 238,000 [[#Olympic-size swimming pool|Olympic Swimming pools]], or 476,000 [[#Acre-foot|acre-feet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/The-secret-harbour-uncovered/2004/12/10/1102625541209.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116134156/http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/The-secret-harbour-uncovered/2004/12/10/1102625541209.html|title=The secret harbour uncovered|archivedate=16 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.bom.gov.au/social/blog/39/when-dam-size-matters/ |title=When dam size matters |author= Australian Bureau of Meteorology |accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=NSW Irrigators' Council (NSWIC)|title=Useful Water Comparisons|url=http://www.nswic.org.au/pdf/fact_sheets/USEFUL%20WATER%20COMPARISONS.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Grand Canyon===
With a volume measure approximately 4 orders of magnitude greater than a Sydharb, the volume of the [[Grand Canyon]] may be used to visualize even larger things, like the magma chamber underneath Yellowstone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/04/23/scientists-find-missing-link-in-yellowstone-plumbing-this-giant-volcano-is-very-much-alive/|title=Scientists find missing link in Yellowstone plumbing: This giant volcano is very much alive|author=Joel Achenbach|date=23 April 2015|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk|title=How Many Things Are There?|date=28 April 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eesmyal.com/2012/02/human-cube/|title=Human Cube - eesmyal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[National Park Service]], the volume of the Grand Canyon is {{convert|4.17|e12m3|e12yd3|abbr=off}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/management/statistics.htm|title=Park Statistics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is {{convert|4.17|e12m3|km3|disp=output only}} ({{convert|4.17|e12m3|mi3|disp=output only}}).

==Flow rate==
===Miner's inch===
{{main|Miner's inch}}
The volume of water which flows in one unit of time through an orifice one inch square or in diameter. The size of the unit varies from one place to another.

==Mass==
===Grave===
In 1793, the French term "[[grave (mass)|grave]]" (from "gravity") was suggested as the base unit of mass for the metric system. In 1795, however, the name "[[kilogramme]]" was adopted instead.

===Bag of cement and bag mix===
The mass of an old bag of [[Portland cement|cement]] was one [[hundredweight]] ~ 112&amp;nbsp;lb, approximately 50&amp;nbsp;kg. The amount of material that, say, an aircraft could carry into the air is often visualised as the number of bags of cement that it could lift. In the concrete and petroleum industry, however, a bag of cement is defined as 94 pounds (~ 42.6&amp;nbsp;kg), because it has an apparent volume close to 1 cubic foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cement.org/tech/faq_unit_weights.asp|title=Frequently Asked Questions, unit weights|publisher=Portland Cement Association|date=2011|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[ready-mix concrete]] is specified, a "bag mix" unit is used as if the batching company mixes 5 literal bags of cement per cubic yard (or cubic metre) when a "5 bag mix" is ordered.

===Jupiter===
[[File:Jupiter by Cassini-Huygens.jpg|thumb|upright|Jupiter]]
When reporting on the masses of [[extrasolar planet]]s, astronomers often discuss them in terms of multiples of [[Jupiter mass|Jupiter's mass]] ({{Jupiter mass}} = 1.9 {{e|27}}&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/extrasolar-planet-types-100214.html |title=Out There: A Strange Zoo of Other Worlds |publisher=Space.com |date=2010-02-14 |accessdate=2012-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, "Astronomers recently discovered a planet outside our Solar System with a mass of approximately 3 Jupiters." Furthermore, the mass of Jupiter is nearly equal to one thousandth of the mass of the Sun.

===Sun===
[[Solar mass]] ({{Solar mass}} = {{val|2.0|e=30|u=kg}}) is also often used in astronomy when talking about masses of stars or galaxies; for example, [[Alpha Centauri A]] has the mass of 1.1 suns, and the [[Milky Way]] has a mass of approximately {{Solar mass|6{{e|11}}}}.

Solar mass also has a special use when estimating orbital periods and distances of 2 bodies using [[Kepler's laws]]: ''a&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = M&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''a'' is length of [[semi-major axis]] in [[astronomical unit|AU]], ''T'' is orbital period in years and ''M&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the combined mass of objects in {{Solar mass}}. In case of planet orbiting a star, ''M&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be approximated to mean the mass of the central object. More specifically in the case of Sun and Earth the numbers reduce to ''M&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;'' ~ 1, ''a'' ~ 1 and ''T'' ~ 1.

==Time==
&lt;!-- Please keep these sorted in ascending order --&gt;

===Light-distance===
[[George Gamow]] discussed measurements of time such as the "light-mile" and "[[light-foot]]", the time taken for light to travel the specified unit distance, defined by "reversing the procedure" used in defining a light-year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=George Gamow|title=One Two Three ... Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science|location=New York|publisher=Viking|date=1947|page=77|title-link=One Two Three ... Infinity}}&lt;/ref&gt; One light-[[nanosecond]] is roughly 30 centimeters (29.9792458 cm exactly), or about a foot (30.48 cm).

===Shake===
In [[nuclear chain reaction|nuclear engineering]] and astrophysics contexts, the [[shake (time)|shake]] is sometimes used as a conveniently short period of time. 1&amp;nbsp;shake is defined as 10&amp;nbsp;[[nanosecond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pathogenesis and Therapy of Combined Radiation Injury |url=http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/CR06_1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106134035/http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/CR06_1.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 January 2007 |format=PDF |publisher=Defense Threat Reduction Agency |accessdate=2006-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jiffy===
In [[computing]], the [[jiffy (time)|jiffy]] is the duration of one tick of the system timer [[interrupt]]. Typically, this time is 0.01&amp;nbsp;seconds, though in some earlier systems (such as the [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[8-bit]] machines) the jiffy was defined as {{frac|1|60}} of a second, roughly equal to the vertical refresh period (i.e. the field rate) on [[NTSC]] video hardware (and the [[utility frequency|period of AC electric power]] in North America).

===Martian second===
{{main|timekeeping on Mars}}
The United States-based [[NASA]], when conducting missions to the planet [[Mars (planet)|Mars]], has typically used a time of day system calibrated to the mean solar day on that planet (known as a "sol"), training those involved on those missions to acclimate to that length of day, which is 88775 SI seconds, 2375 longer than the mean solar day on Earth. NASA's Martian timekeeping system slows down clocks so that the 24-hour day is stretched to the length of that on Mars, so that Martian hours, minutes and seconds are 2.75% longer than their SI counterparts..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/spotlight/spirit/a3_20040108.html |title=Watchmaker With Time to Lose |website=JPL Mars Exploration Rovers |year=2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.space.com/20243-mars-rover-curiosity-discoveries-grotzinger.html |title=After Finding Mars Was Habitable, Curiosity Keeps Roving |first=Nola Taylor |last=Redd |website=space.com |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microfortnight===
One unit derived from the [[FFF system]] of units is the microfortnight, one millionth of the fundamental time unit of FFF, which equals 1.2096&amp;nbsp;seconds. This is a fairly representative example of "[[computer humor|hacker humor]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/M/microfortnight.html|title=microfortnight|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is occasionally used in operating systems; for example, the [[OpenVMS]] TIMEPROMPTWAIT parameter is measured in microfortnights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/dec-faq/vms/part3 |title=OpenVMS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), Part 3/11 |at=4.1.1.1.4 EXE$GL_TODR |date=11 April 2005 |accessdate=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sidereal day===
The [[sidereal day]] is based on the Earth's rotation rate relative to fixed stars, rather than the Sun. A sidereal day is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0905 SI seconds.

===Decimal time systems===
{{main article|Decimal time}}
[[File:Decimal_Time_Clock.jpeg|thumb|Decimal Time clock reading 2.50 DT equivalent to 6 AM standard time]]
The measurement of time is unique in SI in that while the [[second]] is the base unit, and measurements of time smaller than a second use prefixed units smaller than a second (e.g. microsecond, nanosecond, etc.), measurements larger than a second instead use traditional divisions, including the [[sexagesimal]]-based ''[[minute]]'' and ''[[hour]]'' as well as the less regular ''[[day]]'' and ''[[year]]'' units. SI allows for the use of larger prefixed units based on the second, a system known as [[metric time]], but this is unusual.

There have been numerous proposals and usage of [[decimal time]], most of which were based on the day as the base unit. For instance, in dynastic China, the [[kè]] was a unit that represented {{frac|1|100}} of a day (it has since been refined to {{frac|1|96}} of a day, or 15 minutes). In France, a decimal time system in place from 1793 to 1805 divided the day into 10 hours, each divided into 100 minutes, in turn each divided into 100 seconds; the [[French Republican Calendar]] further extended this by assembling days into ten-day "weeks". [[Ordinal date]]s and [[Julian day]]s, the latter of which has seen use in astronomy as it is not subject to [[leap year]] complications) allow for the expression of a decimal portion of the day.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, the [http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/daterdnm.sh current Mean Julian Day], precise to 6 decimal place, from the [[United States Naval Observatory]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s, to defeat the advantage of the recently introduced computers for the then popular rally racing in the Midwest, competition lag times in a few events were given in centids ({{frac|1|100}} day, 864 seconds, 14.4 minutes), millids ({{frac|1|1,000}} day, 86.4 seconds) and centims ({{frac|1|100}} minute, 0.6 seconds) the latter two looking and sounding a bit like the related units of minutes and seconds. Decimal time proposals are frequently used in fiction, often in [[futurism|futuristic]] works.

In addition to decimal time, there also exist [[binary clock]]s and [[hexadecimal time]].

===Dog year===
{{main article|Aging in dogs}}
[[File:10 yr old Mastiff.JPG|thumb|A 10-year-old [[Neapolitan Mastiff]]]]
There are two diametrically opposed definitions of the ''dog year'', primarily used to approximate the equivalent age of [[dog]]s and other animals with similar life spans. Both are based upon a popular myth regarding the [[aging in dogs|aging of dogs]] that states that a dog ages seven years in the time it takes a human to age one year.
*One seventh of a year, or approximately 52 days.&lt;ref name=dogyear&gt;[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43339983/ns/today-today_pets_and_animals/ Multimillionaire pooch dies at age 12 (84 in dog years)]. ''MSNBC.com''. Retrieved 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; When this definition is used, a standard calendar year is known as a "human year".
*A standard (365-day) calendar year of a dog's life, whereas a "human year" is the period of a dog's (or other animal's) life that is claimed to be equivalent to a year of a human being's life (or seven calendar years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | url         = http://www.dog-food-corner.com/dog-years-human-years-age.htm

  | archivedate = 14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When these units are used, measurements in both "dog years" and "human years" are often included together, to more clearly indicate which name is used for each unit.&lt;ref name=dogyear/&gt;

In fact, the aging of a dog varies by breed (larger breeds tend to have shorter lifespans than small and medium-sized breeds); dogs also develop faster and have longer adulthoods relative to their total life span than humans. Most dogs are sexually mature by 1 year old, which corresponds to perhaps 13 years old in humans. [[Giant dog breed]]s and [[bulldog]]s tend to have the strongest linear correspondence to human aging, with longer adolescences and shorter overall lifespans; such breeds typically age about nine times as fast as humans throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610035254/http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archivedate=2009-06-10|title=Sexual Maturity&amp;nbsp;— Spay and Neuter|publisher=Buffalo.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galactic year===
{{Main article|Galactic year}}
The most common large-scale time scale is millions of years ([[megaannum]] or "Ma"). However, for long-term measurements, this still requires rather large numbers. Using as a measure the time it takes for the solar system to revolve once around the galactic core (GY - not to be confused with Gyr for [[gigayear]]), approximately 250&amp;nbsp;Ma, yields some easily memorizable numbers. In this scale, oceans appeared on Earth after 4&amp;nbsp;GY, life is detectable at 5&amp;nbsp;GY, and multicellular organisms first appeared at 15&amp;nbsp;GY. Dinosaurs became extinct about {{frac|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;GY ago, and the true age of mammals began about 0.2&amp;nbsp;GY ago. The [[age of the Earth]] is estimated at about 20&amp;nbsp;GY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geologic Time Galactic |url=http://www.vendian.org/mncharity/dir3/geologic_time_galactic/ |publisher="vendian.org" |accessdate=2006-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Angular measure==
===Furman===
The Furman is a unit of angular measure equal to {{frac|1|65,536}} of a circle, or just under 20 [[arcsecond]]s. It is named for Alan T. Furman, the American mathematician who adapted the [[CORDIC]] algorithm for 16-bit fixed-point arithmetic sometime around 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Furman |first=Alan T. |title=The Cordic Algorithm for Fixed-Point Polar Geometry |url=http://www.forth.org/fd/FD-V04N1.pdf |journal=FORTH Dimensions |volume=4 |pages=14–15 |accessdate=2009-01-16 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 16 bits give a resolution of 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; = 65,536 distinct angles.

===Binary degree, binary radian, brad===
{{See also|Binary scaling#Binary angles}}
A related unit of angular measure equal to {{Frac|1|256}} of a circle, represented by 8 bits, has found some use in machinery control where fine precision is not required, most notably crankshaft and camshaft position in [[engine control unit|internal combustion engine controllers]], and in video game programming. There is no consensus as to its name, but it has been called the 8-Bit Furman, the Small Furman, the Furboy and more recently, the miFurman, (milli-binary-Furman). These units are convenient because they form cycles: for the 8-bit unit, the value overflows from 255 to 0 when a full circle has been traversed, so binary addition and subtraction work as expected. Measures are often made using a [[Gray code]], which is trivially converted into more conventional notation.

===Grade ''(also grad, gradian, gon)''===
{{Main article|Grad (angle)}}
Coordinates were measured in grades on official French terrestrial ordnance charts from the French revolution well into the 20th century. 1 grade ''(or in modern symbology 1 gon)'' = 0.9° or 0.01 right angle. One advantage of this measure is that the distance between latitude lines 0.01 gon apart at the equator is almost exactly 1 kilometer ''(and would be exactly 1 km if the original definition of 1 meter = {{frac|1|10,000}} quarter-meridian had been adhered to)''. One disadvantage is that common angles like 30° and 60° are expressed by fractional values (33{{frac|1|3}} and 66{{frac|2|3}} respectively) so this "decimal" unit failed to displace the "sexagesimal" units equilateral-vertex — degree — minute — second invented by Babylonian astronomers.

===Angular mil===
[[File:mil estimation.jpg|thumb|upright|Estimating angular mils by hand]]
The [[angular mil]] is used by many military organisations to measure plane angle and so to triangulate distances, given an object's apparent and actual size. It is approximately the angle which has a tangent of {{frac|1|1,000}}; in NATO standard, this is rounded to {{frac|1|6,400}} of a circle, although other definitions are in use. Its name derives from {{lang-la|millesimus}} ("thousandth") and so the fact it is used mostly by the military is coincidental to its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Collins Concise Dictionary of the English Language|date=1982|isbn=978-0-00-433091-4|editor-first=William T|editor-last=Macleod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy==
===Electronvolt mass===
{{Main article|Electronvolt#Mass}}
It is common in particle physics, where mass and energy are often interchanged, to use eV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where eV (electronvolt) is the kinetic energy of an [[electron]] accelerated over one [[volt]] ({{val|1.6|e=-19}} [[joule]]s), c is the speed of light in a vacuum (from E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This definition is intuitive for a [[linear particle accelerator]] when accelerating electrons.

::1 [[atomic mass unit|amu]]&amp;nbsp;= 931.46 MeV/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Even more common is to use a system of natural units with c set to 1, and simply use eV as a unit of mass.

===Gasoline gallon equivalent===
{{Main article|Gasoline gallon equivalent}}
In 2011 the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] introduced the ''gallon gasoline equivalent'' as a unit of energy because their research showed most U.S. citizens do not understand the standard units. The gallon gasoline equivalent is defined as 33.7 kWh,&lt;ref name=EPAstudy10&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/label/420r10909.pdf|title=Environmental Protection Agency Fuel Economy Label - Final Report|authors=Office of Transportation and Air Quality, EPA, and [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]], Us DoT|publisher=[[US Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=September 2010|accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or about 1.213{{e|8}} joules.

Efficiency or fuel economy can be given as [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]].

===Tons of TNT equivalent===
{{Main article|TNT equivalent|Richter magnitude scale#Examples}}
The energy of various amounts of the explosive [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (kiloton, megaton, gigaton) is often used as a unit of [[explosion]] energy, and sometimes of asteroid impacts and violent explosive volcanic eruptions. One ton of TNT produces 4.184{{e|9}} joules, or (by arbitrary definition) exactly {{10^|9}} [[calorie|thermochemical calories]] (approximately 3.964{{e|6}} BTU). This definition is only loosely based on the actual physical properties of TNT.

===Hiroshima bomb and Halifax explosion===
[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima - NARA 542192 - Edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Hiroshima bomb explosion]]
[[File:Halifax Explosion blast cloud.jpg|thumb|upright|Halifax explosion]]
{{Main article|Moment magnitude scale#Nuclear explosions}}
The energy released by the [[Little Boy|Hiroshima bomb]] explosion (about 15&amp;nbsp;kt TNT equivalent, or 6{{e|13}}&amp;nbsp;J) is often used by [[geologist]]s as a unit when describing the energy of [[earthquake]]s, [[volcanic eruption]]s, and [[impact event|asteroid impact]]s.

Prior to the detonation of the Hiroshima bomb, the size of the [[Halifax Explosion]] (about 3&amp;nbsp;kt TNT equivalent, or 1.26{{e|13}}&amp;nbsp;J), was the standard for this type of relative measurement. Each explosion had been the largest known man-made detonation to date.&lt;ref name=TimeDisaster&gt;{{cite book |title=Time: Disasters that Shook the World|publisher=Time Home Entertainment|location=New York City|date=2012|page=56|isbn=978-1-60320-247-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foe===
A [[Foe (unit)|foe]] is a unit of energy equal to {{10^|44}}&amp;nbsp;[[joule]]s (≈9.478{{e|40}} [[British thermal unit|BTU]]) that was coined by physicist Gerry Brown of [[Stony Brook University]]. To measure the staggeringly immense amount of energy produced by a [[supernova]], specialists occasionally use the "foe", an acronym derived from the phrase [ten to the power of] '''f'''ifty-'''o'''ne '''e'''rgs, or {{10^|51}}&amp;nbsp;[[erg]]s. This unit of measure is convenient because a supernova typically releases about one foe of observable energy in a very short period of time (which can be measured in seconds).

==Other metric-compatible scales==
===Power: Ton of refrigeration===
{{Main article|Ton of refrigeration}}
The rate at which heat is removed by melting {{convert|1|ST|kg|spell=in}} of ice over twenty-four hours is referred to as a ton of refrigeration, or sometimes a ton of cooling. This unit of refrigeration capacity came from the days when large blocks of ice were used for cooling, and is still used to describe the heat-removal capabilities of refrigerators and chillers today. One ton of refrigeration is equal to 12,000 BTU/h exactly, or 3.517&amp;nbsp;kW.

===Flow: Amazon River===
The volume of discharge of the [[Amazon River]] sometimes used to describe large volumes of water flow such as ocean currents. The unit is equivalent to 216,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s ([[cumec]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/18722/Amazon-River "Amazon River"], "Encyclopædia Britannica", 2010, Retrieved 8 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flow: Sverdrup ===
One [[Sverdrup]] (Sv) is equal to 1,000,000 cubic metres per second (264,000,000 USgal/s). It is used almost exclusively in [[oceanography]] to measure the volumetric rate of transport of [[Ocean current|ocean currents]].

===Energy intensity===
The [[langley (unit)|langley]] (symbol Ly) is used to measure solar radiation or [[insolation]]. It is equal to one thermochemical [[calorie]] per square centimetre (4.184{{e|4}}&amp;nbsp;J/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or ≈3.684 BTU/sq&amp;nbsp;ft) and was named after [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]]. Its symbol should not be confused with that for the light-year, ly.

===Kinematic viscosity===
One of the few [[centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] units to see wider use, one [[kinematic viscosity|stokes]] (symbol S or St) is a unit of [[kinematics|kinematic]] [[viscosity]], defined as 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s, i.e., 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s (≈1.08×10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;ft/s).

===Angular velocity===
'''MERU''' (Milli Earth Rate Unit), an [[angular velocity]] equal to 1/1000 of Earth's rotation rate: 1 MERU = 0.015 degrees/hour ≈ 0.072921 microradian/second. Sometimes used to measure the angular drift rate of an [[inertial navigation system]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of High Accuracy Inertial Navigation,'' Averil B. Chatfield, [American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics], 1997, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electromagnetic flux===
In [[radio astronomy]], the unit of [[flux|electromagnetic flux]] is the [[jansky]] (symbol Jy), equivalent to 10&lt;sup&gt;−26&lt;/sup&gt; [[watt]]s per square metre per [[hertz]] (= 10&lt;sup&gt;−26&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in base units, about 8.8×10&lt;sup&gt;−31&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;BTU/ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). It is named after the pioneering radio astronomer [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]]. The brightest natural radio sources have flux densities of the order of one to one hundred jansky.

===Metre of water equivalent===
{{main|Meter water equivalent}}
A material-dependent unit used in [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]] and engineering to measure the thickness of shielding, for example around a [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]], [[particle accelerator]], or [[particle detector|radiation or particle detector]]. 1 mwe of a material is the thickness of that material that provides the equivalent shielding of one metre (≈39.4&amp;nbsp;in) of water.

This unit is commonly used in underground science to express the extent to which the [[overburden]] (usually rock) shields an underground space or laboratory from [[cosmic ray]]s. The actual thickness of overburden through which cosmic rays must traverse to reach the underground space varies as a function of direction due to the shape of the overburden, which may be a mountain, or a flat plain, or something more complex like a cliff side. To express the depth of an underground space in mwe (or kmwe for deep sites) as a single number, the convention is to use the depth beneath a flat overburden at [[sea level]] that gives the same overall cosmic ray [[muon]] flux in the underground location.

===Strontium unit: radiation dose===
The [[strontium unit]], formerly known as the Sunshine Unit (symbol S.U.), is a unit of biological contamination by radioactive substances (specifically [[strontium-90]]). It is equal to one [[Curie|picocurie]] of Sr-90 per [[gram]] of body [[calcium]]. Since about 2% of the human body mass is calcium, and Sr-90 has a [[half-life]] of 28.78 years, releasing 6.697+2.282 [[electronvolt|MeV]] per disintegration, this works out to about 1.065{{e|-12}}&amp;nbsp;[[gray (unit)|gray]]s per second. The permissible body burden was established at 1,000&amp;nbsp;S.U.

===Banana equivalent dose===
[[File:Bananen Frucht.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.5|A banana contains [[naturally occurring radioactive material]] in the form of [[potassium-40]]]]
Bananas, like most organic material, naturally contain a certain amount of radioactive isotopes—even in the absence of any artificial pollution or contamination. The [[banana equivalent dose]], defined as the additional dose a person will absorb from eating one banana, expresses the severity of exposure to radiation, such as resulting from nuclear weapons or medical procedures, in terms that would make sense to most people. This is approximately 78 nano[[sievert]]s - in informal publications one often sees this estimate rounded up to 0.1 μSv.

===Molar mass of cellulose===
In the [[pulp and paper]] industry, [[molar mass]] is traditionally measured with a method where the [[intrinsic viscosity]] (dL/g) of the pulp sample is measured in cupriethylenediamine (Cuen). The intrinsic viscosity [η] is related to the weight-average molar mass (in [[atomic mass unit|dalton]]s) by the [[Mark-Houwink equation]]: [η] = 0.070 M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0.70&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Mürşide Kes, Bjørn E. Christensen, A re-investigation of the Mark–Houwink–Sakurada parameters for cellulose in Cuen: A study based on size-exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle light scattering and viscometry, Journal of Chromatography A, Volume 1281, 15 March 2013, Pages 32-37, ISSN 0021-9673, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.01.038 doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2013.01.038].&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is typical to cite [η] values directly in dL/g, as the "viscosity" of the cellulose, confusingly as it is not a viscosity.

===Iodine, bromine and kappa number===
In measuring unsaturation in fatty acids, the traditional method is the [[iodine value|iodine number]]. Iodine adds stoichiometrically to double bonds, so their amount is reported in grams of iodine spent per 100 grams of oil. The standard unit is a dimensionless stoichiometry ratio of moles double bonds to moles fatty acid. A similar quantity, [[bromine number]], is used in gasoline analysis.

In pulp and paper industry, a similar [[kappa number]] is used to measure how much [[bleaching]] a pulp requires. [[Potassium permanganate]] is added to react with the unsaturated compounds (lignin and uronic acids) in the pulp and back-titrated. Originally with [[Bleaching of wood pulp#Chlorine_and_hypochlorite|chlorine bleaching]] the required quantity of [[chlorine]] could be then calculated, although modern methods use multiple stages. Since the oxidizable compounds are not exclusively lignin and the partially pulped lignin does not have a single stoichiometry, the relation between the kappa number and the precise [[amount of substance|amount]] of lignin is inexact.

==Demography and epidemiology==
[[Demography]] and quantitative [[epidemiology]] are [[statistical]] fields that deal with [[count data|counts]] or proportions of people, or rates of change in these. [[Count data|Counts]] and proportions are technically [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]], and so have no [[units of measurement]], although identifiers such as "people", "births", "infections" and the like are used for clarity. Rates of change are [[rate (mathematics)|counts per unit of time]] and strictly have inverse time dimensions (per unit of time). In [[demography#Common Rates and Ratios|demography]] and epidemiology expressions such as [[Mortality rate|"deaths per year"]] are used to clarify what is being measured.

[[Prevalence]], a common measure in [[epidemiology]] is strictly a type of [[denominator data]], a dimensionless ratio or proportion. [[Prevalence]] may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage or as the number of cases per 1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 in the population of interest.

===Micromort===
{{Main article|Micromort}}
A micromort is a unit of [[risk]] measuring a one-in-a-million [[probability]] of [[death]] (from [[micro-]] and [[Wikt:mortality|mortality]]). Micromorts can be used to measure riskiness of various day-to-day activities. A microprobability is a one-in-a million chance of some event; thus a micromort is the microprobability of death. For example, smoking 1.4 cigarettes increases one's death risk by one micromort, as does traveling {{convert|230|mi|abbr=in|order=flip}} by car.

===Numbers of people: Stadium capacities===
[[File:AFL Grand Final 2010 on the Melbourne Cricket Ground.jpg|thumb|To make large numbers of people comprehensible, the capacity of large stadiums is often used. Here the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) is in the process of filling with 100,016 spectators on [[2010 AFL Grand Final|AFL grand final day in 2010]].]]
The large numbers of people involved in [[demography]] are often difficult to comprehend. A useful visualisation tool is the audience capacity of large sports stadiums (often about 100,000). Often the capacity of the largest stadium in a region serves as a unit for a large number of people. For example, Uruguay's [[Estadio Centenario]] is often used in [[Uruguay]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com.uy/091011/pciuda-447246/ciudades/ahora-la-borrachera-es-previa-a-la-fiesta/ Ahora la borrachera es "previa" a la fiesta] - Diario El País, 11 October 2009 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/97129-los-desocupados-colmarian-tres-y-medio-estadios-centenarios] - La República, 7 November 2002 (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; while in parts of the United States, [[Michigan Stadium]] is used in this manner.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In Australia, the capacity of the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (about 100,000) is often cited in this manner. Hence the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] serves as both a measure of people and a [[#Melbourne Cricket Ground|unit of volume]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Diabetes Australia|title=Diabetes - The Facts|url=https://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/PageFiles/1615/the%20facts%20DA%20FINAL%202011.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=NSW Department of Education and Communities|title=What the experts say about cyberbullying|url=http://www.schoolatoz.nsw.edu.au/technology/cyberbullying/what-the-experts-say |accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Age|title=Trouble brewing at the bottom of the bay|url=http://www.scubadoctor.com.au/article-bay-trouble-brewing.htm|accessdate=2014-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Struck by lightning===
"Struck by Lightning" is often used to put highly-infrequent events into perspective.  Among the ~300 million people in the United States, there are ~300 people struck by lightning annually and ~30 killed, making a lightning strike a one in a million event and a death a one in ten million event; given a mean life expectancy of slightly over 75 years, the chances of an American ever being struck in their lifetime is about 1 in 13,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=National Weather Service|title=NWS Lightning Safety Home Page|url=http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml|accessdate=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example: “A person is about 15 times more likely to be struck by lightning in a given year than to be killed by a stranger with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or chronic psychosis.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gun Violence and Mental Illness|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26341929-gun-violence-and-mental-illness?from_search=true|accessdate=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer and information science==
The growth of computing has necessitated the creation of many new units, several of which are based on unusual foundations.

===Data volume===
[[File:Print vs. bytes.jpg|thumb|A CD-ROM can easily store the entirety of a paper encyclopedia's words and images, plus audio and video clips]]
Volume or capacity of data is often compared to various famous works of literature or to large collections of writing. Popular units include bibles, encyclopaediae, [[complete works of Shakespeare|the complete works of Shakespeare]], and the [[Library of Congress]].

When the [[Compact Disc]] began to be used as a [[data storage device]], the [[CD-ROM]], journalists had to compare the disc capacity (650 [[megabyte]]s) to something everyone could imagine. Since many Western households had a Christian [[Bible]], and the [[Bible]] is a comparatively long [[book]], it was often chosen for this purpose. The [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version of the Bible]] in uncompressed plain 8-bit text contains about 4.5 million characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10|title=The Bible, Old and New Testaments, King James Version - Project Gutenberg|accessdate=2011-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; so a [[CD-ROM]] can store about 150 [[Bible]]s.

The print version of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' is another common data volume metric. It contains approximately 300 million characters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/business/44-million-words-strong-britannica-to-join-internet.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|author=John Markoff|title=44 Million Words Strong, Britannica to Join Internet|accessdate=2011-12-07|date=1994-02-08|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; so two copies would fit onto a [[CD-ROM]] and still have 50 megabytes (or about 11 bibles) left over.

The term ''Library of Congress'' is often used as an unusual unit of measurement to represent an impressively large quantity of [[data (computing)|data]] when discussing [[computer data storage|digital storage]] or [[computer network|networking technologies]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} It refers to the US [[Library of Congress]]. Information researchers have estimated that the entire print collections of the [[Library of Congress]] represent roughly 10 [[terabyte]]s of uncompressed [[text file|textual data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info/how-much-info.pdf#page=110|author=Peter Lyman|author2=Hal R. Varian|title=How Much Information?|accessdate=2011-11-29|date=2000-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nibble===
A measure of quantity of data or information, the "[[nibble]]" (sometimes spelled "nybble" or "nybl") is normally equal to 4 bits, or one half of the common 8-bit byte. The nibble is used to describe the amount of memory used to store a digit of a number stored in [[binary-coded decimal]] format, or to represent a single hexadecimal digit. Less commonly, 'nibble' may be used for any contiguous portion of a byte of specified length, e.g. "6-bit nibble"; this usage is most likely to be encountered in connection with a hardware architecture in which the word length is not a multiple of 8, such as older 36-bit minicomputers.

===FLOPS===
{{Main article|FLOPS}}
In [[computing]], FLOPS (''FL''oating point ''O''perations ''P''er ''S''econd) is a measure of a computer's computing power. It is also common to see measurements of kilo, mega, giga, and teraFLOPS.

It is also used to compare the performance of algorithms in practice.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

=== BogoMips ===
{{Main article|BogoMips}}
A measure to determine the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] speed. It was invented by [[Linus Torvalds]] and is nowadays present on every [[Linux]] operating system. However, it is not a meaningful measure to assess the actual [[Central processing unit|CPU]] performance.

===KLOC: computer program length===
A computer programming expression, the [[source lines of code|K-LOC]] or KLOC, pronounced ''kay-lok'', standing for "kilo-[[source lines of code|lines of code]]", i.e., thousand lines of code. The unit was used, especially by [[IBM]] managers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Triumph of the Nerds|network=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; to express the amount of work required to develop a piece of software. Given that estimates of 20 lines of functional code per day per programmer were often used, it is apparent that 1 K-LOC could take one programmer as long as 50 working days, or 10 working weeks. This measure is no longer in widespread use because different computer languages require different numbers of lines to achieve the same result (occasionally the measure "assembly equivalent lines of code" is used, with appropriate conversion factors from the language actually used to assembly language).

Error rates in programming are also measured in "Errors per K-LOC", which is called the ''defect density''. NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center#Software Assurance Technology Center|SATC]] is one of the few organisations to claim zero defects in a large (&gt;500K-LOC) project, for the space shuttle software.

An alternative measurement was defined by [[Pegasus Mail]] author [[David Harris (software developer)|David Harris]]: the "WaP" is equivalent to 71,500 lines of program code, because that number of lines is the length of one edition of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pmail.com/devnews_archive.htm&lt; (April 2017 article)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ticks===
The "tick" is the amount of time between timer [[interrupt]]s generated by the timer circuit of a CPU. The amount of time is processor-dependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laplante |first1=Phillip A. |last2=Ovaska |first2=Seppo J. |title=Real-Time Systems Design and Analysis: Tools for the Practitioner |date=22 November 2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780470768648 |page=122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ez6-aSfbqtsC&amp;pg=PA122|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bovet |first1=Daniel P. |last2=Cesati |first2=Marco |title=Understanding the Linux Kernel: From I/O Ports to Process Management |date=17 November 2005 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |isbn=9780596554910 |page=245 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0lltXyJ8aIC&amp;pg=PT245 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purchasing power parity==
===Big Mac Index===
{{Main article|Big Mac Index}}
[[File:Big Mac hamburger.jpg|thumb|A McDonald's Big Mac hamburger, as advertised in the United States]]
''[[The Economist]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Big Mac Index]] compares the [[purchasing power parity]] of countries in terms of the cost of a [[Big Mac]] hamburger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Big MacCurrencies |publisher=The Economist |date=1998-04-09 |url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_TVJRVJ |accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was felt to be a good measure of the prices of a basket of commodities in the local economy including labour, rent, meat, bread, cardboard, advertising, lettuce, etc.

A similar system used in the UK is the '[[Mars bar]]'. Tables of prices in Mars Bars have intermittently appeared in newspapers over the last 20 years, usually to illustrate changes in wages or prices over time without the confusion caused by inflation.&lt;ref name="ft_inflation"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/9f128868-68b4-11da-bd30-0000779e2340.html Mars Bar], Nico Colchester Fellowship, FT.com (Financial Times website). Article dated 2001-01-26. Retrieved 2007-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coffee/Latte===
The cost of a cup of coffee (or sometimes latte) from a coffeehouse or cafe is often used as a measurement of two vectors: the relatively diminuitive expense of something frivolous, versus the power of collective contributions towards something important. Campaigns implore something to the effect of, "for the cost of a cup of coffee, you can help stamp out diabetes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Centipawn===
[[Chess]] software frequently uses centipawns internally or externally as a unit measuring how strong each player's situation position is, and hence also by how much one player is beating the other, and how strong a possible move is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chess-db.com/public/research/qualityofplay.html|title=Chess Play Quality Index|author=|date=|website=chess-db.com|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 100 centipawns = [[chess piece relative value|the value of]] 1 pawn - more specifically, something like the average value of the pawns at the start of the game, as the actual value of pawns depends on their position. Loss of a pawn will therefore typically lose that player 100 centipawns. The centipawn is often used for comparing possible moves, as in a given position, chess software will often rate the better of two moves within a few centipawns of each other.

===Garn===
The garn is NASA's unit of measure for symptoms resulting from [[space adaptation syndrome]], the response of the human body to weightlessness in space, named after US Senator [[Jake Garn]], who became exceptionally spacesick during an orbital flight in 1985. If an astronaut is completely incapacitated by space adaptation syndrome, he or she is under the effect of one garn of symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/StevensonRE/RES_5-13-99.pdf, p. 35, Johnson Space Center Oral History Project, interview with Dr. Robert Stevenson]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mother Cow Index===
Formerly used in real estate transactions in the American Southwest, it was the number of pregnant cows an acre of a given plot of land could support. It acted as a proxy for the agricultural quality, natural resource availability, and arability of a parcel of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fw4iAQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA371&amp;dq=pregnant%20cow%20acre%20of%20land&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q=pregnant%20cow%20acre%20of%20land&amp;f=false |title=The Country Gentleman - Google Boeken |via=[[Google Books]]|accessdate=2012-10-19|year=1910 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nines===

[[Image:Four nines fine gold.jpeg|thumb|upright|{{convert|1|ozt|g|lk=in}} of four nines fine gold (999,9)]]
Numbers very close to, but below one are often expressed in "[[nines (engineering)|nines]]" (N &amp;mdash; not to be confused with the unit [[newton (unit)|newton]]), that is in the number of nines following the decimal separator in writing the number in question. For example, "three nines" or "3N" indicates 0.999 or 99.9%, "four nines five" or "4N5" is the expression for the number 0.99995 or 99.995%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vikashazrati.wordpress.com/2008/10/24/truth-about-availabilit/|title=The Truth About Availability: What does 99.99% mean?|website=c0nnexx10n: C0nnect1ng L1fe w1th Techn010gy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Precious Metals |volume=4 |year=1981 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=KOMYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22four+nines+five%22 262]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=PVD for Microelectronics: Sputter Desposition to Semiconductor Manufacturing|year=1998|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hmvtBE_7i00C&amp;pg=PA387&amp;lpg=PA387&amp;dq=%22four+nines+five%22 387]}}&lt;!-- NOTE: reference has typo, writing 99.9995% as "four-nines-five" while it is actually *five* nines five. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical areas of usage are:
*The [[reliability engineering|reliability]] of computer systems, that is the ratio of [[uptime]] to the sum of [[uptime]] and [[downtime]]. "Five nines" reliability in a continuously operated system means an average [[downtime]] of no more than approximately five minutes per year. (See [[high availability]] for a chart.)
*The [[Nine (purity)|purity]] of materials, such as gases and metals.

===Pain===
[[File:OuchFlintGoodrichShot1941.jpg|thumb|A woman wincing in pain]]
{{See also|Pain scale|Dolorimeter|Pain|Nociception}}
The dol (from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for pain, ''dolor'') is a [[unit of measurement]] for [[pain]]. [[James D. Hardy]], [[Herbert G. Wolff]], and [[Helen Goodell]] of [[Cornell University]] proposed the unit based on their studies of pain during the 1940s and 1950s. They defined one dol to equal to "just noticeable differences" ([[jnd]]'s) in pain. The unit never came into widespread use and other methods are now used to assess the level of pain experienced by patients.

The Schmidt sting pain index and Starr sting pain index are [[pain scale]]s rating the relative pain caused by different [[hymenoptera]]n stings. Schmidt has refined his [[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]] (scaled from 1 to 4) with extensive anecdotal experience, culminating in a paper published in 1990 which classifies the stings of 78 species and 41 genera of Hymenoptera. The [[Starr sting pain scale]] uses the same 1-to-4 scaling.

===Pepper heat===
====ASTA pungency unit====
The ASTA ([[American Spice Trade Association]]) [[piquance|pungency]] unit is based on a scientific method of measuring chili pepper "heat". The technique utilizes [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] to identify and measure the concentrations of the various compounds that produce a heat sensation. Scoville units are roughly {{frac|1|15}} the size of pungency units while measuring [[capsaicin]], so a rough conversion is to multiply pungency by 15 to obtain Scoville heat units.&lt;ref name="tainter"&gt;{{cite book |last= Tainter |first= Donna R.|author2=Anthony T. Grenis |date= 2001 |title= Spices and Seasonings |publisher= Wiley-IEEE |isbn= 978-0-471-35575-5 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=dfp4b3F0598C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=scoville+units|page=30}} — "Interlab variation [for the original Scoville scale] could be as high as ±50%. However, labs that run these procedures could generate reasonably repeatable results."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scoville heat unit====
[[File:Madame Jeanette and other chillies.jpg|thumb|Chili peppers.]]
The [[Scoville scale]] is a measure of the hotness of a [[chili pepper]]. It is the degree of dilution in sugar water of a specific chili pepper extract when a panel of 5 tasters can no longer detect its "heat".&lt;ref name="what_is_scoville_scale"&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/how-hot-is-that-pepper-how-scientists-measure-spiciness-884380/?no-ist]. Retrieved 2016-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Pure [[capsaicin]] (the chemical responsible for the "heat") has 16&amp;nbsp;million Scoville heat units.

===Proof: alcohol concentration===
[[File:Bacardi 151 bottle.jpg|thumb|upright|A (nearly empty) bottle of 151 proof rum.]]
Up to the 20th century, alcoholic spirits were assessed in the UK by mixing with gunpowder and testing the mixture to see if it would still burn; spirit that just passed the test was said to be at 100° [[alcoholic proof|proof]]. The UK now uses percentage [[alcohol by volume]] at 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F), where spirit at 100° proof is approximately 57.15%&amp;nbsp;[[ABV]]; the US uses a "proof number" of twice the ABV at 60&amp;nbsp;°F (15.5&amp;nbsp;°C).{{sfn|Regan|2003|p=}}{{sfn|Berry|1998|p=}}

===Savart===
The [[Savart]] is an 18th-century unit for measuring the frequency ratio of two sounds, it is equal to {{frac|1|1000}} of a [[decade]]. Still used in some programs, but considered too rough for most purposes. [[Cent (music)|Cent]] is preferred.

===Telecommunications traffic volume===
{{Main article|Erlang (unit)}}
The erlang, named after A. K. Erlang, as a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless unit]] is used in [[telephony]] as a statistical measure of the offered intensity of [[telecommunication]]s [[traffic]] on a group of resources. Traffic of one erlang refers to a single [[resource (project management)|resource]] being in continuous use, or two [[channel (communications)|channel]]s being at fifty percent use, and so on, [[wikt:pro rata|pro rata]]. Much telecommunications management and forecasting software uses this.

===Waffle House Index ===
{{Main article|Waffle House Index}}
[[Waffle House Index]] is used by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) to determine the impact of a storm and the likely scale of assistance required for disaster recovery. The measure is based on the reputation of the [[Waffle House]] restaurant chain for staying open during extreme weather. This term was coined by FEMA Administrator [[Craig Fugate]].

===X-ray intensity===
{{Main article|Crab (unit)}}
The crab is defined as the intensity of X-rays emitted from the [[Crab Nebula]] at a given photon energy up to 30 kilo[[electronvolts]]. The Crab Nebula is often used for calibration of X-ray telescopes. For measuring the X-ray intensity of a less energetic source, the milliCrab (mCrab) may be used.

One crab is approximately 24 pW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[File:The looking glass self.png|right|thumb|300px|This drawing depicts the looking-glass self. The person at the front of the image is looking into four mirrors, each of which reflects someone else's image of him back to him.]]

The '''looking-glass self'''&lt;ref&gt;The term is sometimes [[hyphen]]ated in the literature, sometimes not. Compare, for example, the titles of Shaffer (2005) and Yeung &amp; Martin (2003), below.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Social Psychology|social psychological]] concept introduced by [[Charles Cooley|Charles Horton Cooley]] in 1902 (McIntyre 2006). The concept of the looking-glass self describes the development of one's self and of one's identity  through one's interpersonal interactions within the context of society. Cooley clarified that society is an interweaving and inter-working of mental selves. The term "looking glass self" was coined by Cooley in his work, ''Human Nature and the Social Order'' in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;From Charles Horton Cooley, ''Human Nature and the Social Order'', New York: Scribner's, 1902, pp. 152:&lt;/ref&gt;

The looking-glass self has three major components and is unique to humans (Shaffer 2005). According to Lisa McIntyre’s ''The Practical Skeptic: Core Concepts in Sociology'', the concept of the looking-glass self expresses the tendency for one to understand oneself through their own understanding of the perception which others may hold of them. This process is theorized to develop one's sense of identity. Therefore identity, or [[self]], is the result of learning to see ourselves as others do (Yeung &amp; Martin 2003). 

==Symbolic interaction==
In hypothesizing the framework, "the mind is mental" because "the human mind is social".  From the time they are born, humans define themselves within the context of their social interactions. The child learns that the symbol of his/her crying will elicit a response from his/her caregivers, not only when they are in need of necessities such as food or a diaper change, but also when the child is in need of attention. Schubert references Cooley's ''On Self and Social Organization'', "a growing solidarity between mother and child parallels the child's increasing competence in using significant symbols.  This simultaneous development is itself a  necessary prerequisite for the child's ability to adopt the perspectives of other participants in social relationships and, thus, for the child's capacity to develop a social self."

[[George Herbert Mead]] described the creation of the self as the outcome of "taking the role of the other", the premise for which the self is actualized. Through interaction with others, we begin to develop an identity of our own as well as developing a capacity to empathize with others. As stated by Cooley, "The thing that moves us to pride or shame is not the mere mechanical reflection of ourselves, but an imputed sentiment, the imagined effect of this reflection upon another's mind" (Cooley 1964).

==Three main components==
The looking-glass self comprises three main components (Yeung &amp; Martin 2003).{{failed verification|date=September 2018}}

# We imagine how we must appear to others.
# We imagine and react to what we feel their judgment of that appearance must be.
# We develop our self through the judgments of others.

==Studies==
The term "looking-glass self" was coined by Cooley after extensive psychological testing in 1902. In 1976 Arthur L Beaman, [[Edward Diener]], and Soren Svanum  (1979) performed an experiment on the looking-glass self’s effect on children. Another study in the Journal of Family Psychology in 1998, measured the validity of the looking glass self and symbolic interaction in the  context of familial relationships.

===Self reflection study===

On Halloween night, 363 children trick-or-treated at 18 different homes in Seattle, Washington. Each of these 18 homes was selected to take part in the experiment and was in turn arranged in similar ways. In a room near the entry way there was a low table and on it was a large bowl full of bite sized candy. A festive backdrop was also placed in sight of the candy bowl with a small hole for viewing; behind the backdrop was an observer who would record the results of the experiment. The experiment was conducted in the same way at each of the 18 different homes, with each home conducting two different conditions of the experiment, self-awareness manipulation and individuation manipulation. All of the homes conducted both conditions; half of the homes conducting self-awareness manipulation while the other half conducted individuation manipulation. In each of the conditions a woman would answer the door commenting on the children’s costumes and inviting them in. She would then instruct the children to take only one piece of candy from the bowl and excuse herself to another room.

====Self-awareness manipulation====

[[Self-awareness]] manipulation was the first of two conditions performed in Beaman, Diener, and Svanum’s experiment. The self-awareness manipulation condition was performed with a mirror placed at a ninety degree angle directly behind the entry-way table fifty percent of the time. The mirror was placed in such a way that the children could always see their reflection in the mirror when taking candy from the bowl; the other half of the time there was no mirror in place and the children were left anonymous.

====Individuation manipulation====

There was some concern that the children involved in the study would only see their Halloween costumes and not their own self reflections, so a second condition was performed in Beaman, Diener, and Svanum's experiment. This second condition was called individuation manipulation. The individuation manipulation condition was performed in the same way as the self-awareness manipulation. After greeting the children the woman at the door would ask each of the children their name and where he or she lived. These questions were asked in such a way that the children would think nothing of it because many other homes asked the children their names on Halloween night; however, no effort was made to identify the children involved. Just as in the first condition, a mirror was used half of the time and was removed for the other half of the experiment.

====Results====

The children involved in the experiment were split into several different categories based on the results of the experiment.   The criteria consisted of age, group size, and gender.  Out of the 363 children involved in the study, 70 children transgressed when instructed not to.  Children who arrived in groups were more likely to transgress than those children who arrived alone; 20.4% to 10.3% respectively.  Children arriving with adults were not included in the study.

====Gender====

The genders of those who participated in the study were recorded by the unobtrusive observer from behind the festive backdrop.  Out of the 363 children, only 326 children’s genders could be determined because they were wearing Halloween costumes.  Of those children whose genders could be determined there were 190 boys and 136 girls.  While Cooley suggests that girls have a far higher impressionable social sensibility it was not the case in this study, as boys transgressed more often than girls.  Fewer boys transgressed with the mirror present, than without; 15.6% to 35.8%. This trend was the same for girls; 8.4% to 13.2%.

====Year====

While the exact age of each child could not be determined due to the children’s anonymity, approximate ages were given to each child by the unobtrusive observer.  The average age of the children was eight years old.  The results of the study were split up into different categories based on the approximate age given to each child.  The age groups were as follows: ages 1–4, 5–8, 9–12 and 13 or older.  The rate of transgression rose with the age of the child; the 1–4 year olds had a rate of transgression of only 6.5% while the 5–8 year olds transgressed 9.7% of the time.  The two older age groups transgressed far more often than the younger groups; children aged 9–12 transgressed 23.6% of the time while the children aged 13 and older had a rate of transgression of 41.9%.

===Family study===
The research article was included in the Journal of Family Psychology in 1998.  The researchers, Cook and Douglas, measured the validity of the looking glass self and symbolic interaction in the  context of familial relationships. The study analyzed the accuracy of a college student's and an adolescent's perceptions of how they are perceived by their parents.  The 51 participants of this study included four family members (mother, father, college student and adolescent) who returned surveys. The families were primarily white and middle class.  The college student and adolescent were paid ten dollars each, if each family member completed the survey.

Three areas were investigated: assertiveness, firmness, and cooperation. In reference to the three areas respondents were asked the following: how they behave toward the target, how the target behaves toward them, and how they think they are viewed by the target. The study identified the looking glass self as a "metaperception" because it involves "perception of perceptions."  One of the hypotheses tested in the study was: If "metaperceptions" cause self-perceptions they will necessarily be coordinated. The hypothesis was tested at the individual and relationship levels of analysis

====Findings====
The study determined that the hypothesis is strongly supported at the individual level for cooperation for both college students and adolescents, but is only partially supported for assertiveness for college students.  Also for college students, at the relationship level with their mothers the study supported assertiveness. There was an irregular finding regarding firmness in the mother-adolescent relationship that indicated that the firmer adolescents were perceived by their mothers, the less firm they rated themselves in the relationship. While there was not strong support of the hypothesis on the relationship level, on the individual level the findings suggest that how college students and adolescents think about themselves is directly correlated to how they think they are perceived by their parents.

==Critical perspectives==

It has been argued that the looking glass self conceptualization of the social self is critically incomplete in that it overlooks the divergent roles of [[ingroups and outgroups]] in self-definition.&lt;ref name="Onorato &amp; Turner (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turner | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Onorato | first2 = R. S. | editor1-last = Tyler | editor1-first = T. R. | editor2-last = Kramer | editor2-first = R. M. | editor3-last = John | editor3-first = O. P. | year = 1999 | title = Social identity, personality, and the self-concept: A self-categorization perspective | pages = 11–46 | journal = The psychology of the social self | location = Mahwah, NJ | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, it has been demonstrated that while individuals will converge upon the attitudes and behaviours of ingroup members, they will also diverge from the attitudes and behaviours of outgroup members.&lt;ref name="David &amp; Turner (1992)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = David | first1 = B. | last2 = Turner | first2 = J. C. | year = 1992 | title = Studies in self-categorization and minority conversion: Is being a member of the outgroup an advantage? | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 35 | pages = 179–200 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8309.1996.tb01091.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The neglect of the latter scenario is attributed to the looking glass approaches’ implicit focus on ingroup member appraisals. This alternative perspective is derived from the [[self-categorization theory]] analysis of [[social influence]].&lt;ref name="Turner, J. C. (1991)"&gt;Turner, J. C. (1991). Social influence. Milton Keynes: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it is further argued that the looking glass self metaphor fails to reflect the fact that influence derives from the self-categorization of other individuals as part of the self.&lt;ref name="Onorato &amp; Turner (1999)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner (1999)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=J. C.|title=Some current issues in research on social identity and self-categorization theories|journal=Social identity|year=1999|pages=6–34|editor1-first=N.|editor1-last=Ellemers|editor2-first=R.|editor2-last=Spears|editor3-first=B.|editor3-last=Doosje|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, people are not shaped by the reflections from ‘others’, but rather are shaped by the creation of a collective social identity that contrasts ‘us’ ''against'' relevant ‘others’. Therefore, the concept of self-identity may be considered  an example of a [[Social constructionism|social construction]].

'''Media naturalness theory''' is also known as the psychobiological model.  The theory was developed by [[Ned Kock]] and attempts to apply Darwinian evolutionary principles to suggest which types of [[computer-mediated communication]] will best fit innate human communication capabilities.  Media naturalness theory argues that natural selection has resulted in face-to-face communication becoming the most effective way for two people to exchange information.

The theory has been applied to human communication outcomes in various contexts, such as: education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Paretti M.C. |author2=McNair L.D. |author3=Holloway-Attaway L. | year = 2007 | title = Teaching technical communication in an era of distributed work: A case study of collaboration between U.S. and Swedish students | url = | journal = Technical Communication Quarterly | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 327–353 | doi=10.1080/10572250701291087}}&lt;/ref&gt; knowledge transfer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwartz D.G. | year = 2007 | title = Integrating knowledge transfer and computer-mediated communication: Categorizing barriers and possible responses | url = http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=19859889 | journal = Knowledge Management Research &amp; Practice | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 249–260 | doi=10.1057/palgrave.kmrp.8500153}}&lt;/ref&gt; communication in virtual environments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1297151 Verhulsdonck, G.

The media naturalness theory builds on the [[Media Richness Theory|media richness theory's]] arguments that face-to-face interaction is the richest type of communication medium&lt;ref&gt;Daft, R. L. &amp; Lengel, R. H.

== Biological basis ==
A simple thought experiment highlights the biological basis of media naturalness theory, and the fundamental difference between the media naturalness and media richness theories. Let us assume that the human species had evolved in an ancestral environment without light. If that were the case, modern humans would all be blind, and therefore a communication medium's ability to convey facial expressions and body language would be irrelevant for effective communication. Conversely, a medium's ability to convey smell might be fairly important for effective communication. This illustrates the fact that one cannot define a medium's ability to support effective communication without taking into consideration characteristics of the communicators. Of these, biological characteristics often have an evolutionary basis.

== Medium naturalness ==
The naturalness of a communication medium is defined, in media naturalness theory, as the degree of similarity of the medium with the face-to-face medium. The face-to-face medium is presented as the medium enabling the highest possible level of communication naturalness, which is characterized by the following five key elements:&lt;ref name="Kock (2004)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kock (2005)"/&gt; (1) a high degree of co-location, which would allow the individuals engaged in a communication interaction to see and hear each other; (2) a high degree of synchronicity, which would allow the individuals to quickly exchange communicative stimuli; (3) the ability to convey and observe facial expressions; (4) the ability to convey and observe body language; and (5) the ability to convey and listen to speech.

Media naturalness theory predicts that any electronic communication medium allowing for the exchange of significantly less or more communicative stimuli per unit of time than the face-to-face medium will pose cognitive obstacles to communication.&lt;ref name="Kock (2004)"/&gt; In other words, media naturalness theory places the face-to-face medium at the center of a one-dimensional scale of naturalness, where deviations to the left or right are associated with decreases in naturalness (see Figure 1).

[[Image:Media naturalness theory Fig1.png|600px|thumb|Figure 1. Face-to-face medium naturalness.]]

Electronic media that enable the exchange of significantly more communicative stimuli per unit of time than the face-to-face medium are classified by media naturalness theory as having a lower degree of naturalness than the face-to-face medium. As such, those media are predicted to be associated with higher cognitive effort; in this case due primarily to a phenomenon known as [[information overload]], which is characterized by individuals having more communicative stimuli to process than they are able to.&lt;ref name="Kock (2004)"/&gt;

'''Media naturalness effects on cognitive effort, communication ambiguity, and physiological arousal'''. Media naturalness theory's main prediction is that, other things being equal, a decrease in the degree of naturalness of a communication medium leads to the following effects in connection with communication interactions in complex tasks:&lt;ref name="Kock (2005)"/&gt; (a) an increase in cognitive effort, (b) an increase in communication ambiguity, and (c) a decrease in physiological arousal.

'''Naturalness of electronic communication media'''. Electronic communication media often suppress key face-to-face communication elements, with the goal of creating other advantages. For example, Web-based bulletin boards and discussion groups enable asynchronous (or time-disconnected) communication, but at the same time make it difficult to have the same level of feedback immediacy found in face-to-face communication.  That often leads to frustration from users who expect immediate feedback on their postings.&lt;ref name="Kock (2005)"/&gt;

'''The high importance of speech'''. Media naturalness theory predicts that the degree to which an electronic communication medium supports an individual's ability to convey and listen to speech is particularly significant in determining its naturalness. The theory predicts, through its speech imperative proposition,&lt;ref name="Kock (2004)"/&gt; that speech enablement influences naturalness significantly more than a medium's degree of support for the use of facial expressions and body language.

'''Compensatory adaptation'''. According to media naturalness theory, electronic communication media users can adapt their behavior in such a way as to overcome some of the limitations of those media. That is, individuals who choose to use electronic communication media to accomplish complex collaborative tasks may compensate for the cognitive obstacles associated with the lack of naturalness of the media. One of the ways in which this can be achieved through email is by users composing messages that are redundant and particularly well organized, compared to face-to-face communication.  This often contributes to improving the effectiveness of communication, sometimes even beyond that of the face-to-face medium.&lt;ref name="Kock (2007)"/&gt;

== Cognitive effort ==
Human beings possess specialized brain circuits that are designed for the recognition of faces and the generation and recognition of facial expressions, which artificial intelligence research suggests require complex computations that are difficult to replicate even in powerful computers. The same situation is found in connection with speech generation and recognition. Generation and recognition of facial expressions, and speech generation and recognition, are performed effortlessly by humans.&lt;ref name="Kock (2004)"/&gt;

Cognitive effort is defined in media naturalness theory as the amount of mental activity, or, from a biological perspective, the amount of brain activity involved in a communication interaction.&lt;ref name="Kock (2004)"/&gt; It can be assessed directly, with the use of techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging. Cognitive effort can also be assessed indirectly, based on perceptions of levels of difficulty associated with communicative tasks, as well as through indirect measures such as that of fluency. Fluency is defined as the amount of time taken to convey a certain number of words through different communication media, which is assumed to correlate (and serve as a surrogate measure of) the amount of time taken to convey a certain number of ideas through different media.&lt;ref name="Kock (2007)"/&gt; According to media naturalness theory, a decrease in the degree of naturalness of a communication medium leads to an increase in the amount of cognitive effort required to use the medium for communication.&lt;ref name="Kock (2004)"/&gt;

== Communication ambiguity ==
Individuals brought up in different cultural environments usually possess different information processing schemas that they have learned over their lifetimes. Different schemas make individuals interpret information in different ways, particularly when information is expected but not actually provided.&lt;ref name="Kock (2004)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kock (2005)"/&gt;

While different individuals are likely to look for the same types of communicative stimuli, their interpretation of the message being communicated in the absence of those stimuli will be largely based on their learned schemas, which are likely to differ from those held by other individuals (no two individuals, not even identical twins raised together, go through exactly the same experiences during their lives). According to media naturalness theory, a decrease in medium naturalness, caused by the selective suppression of media naturalness elements in a communication medium, leads to an increase in the probability of misinterpretations of communicative cues, and thus an increase in communication ambiguity.&lt;ref name="Kock (2005)"/&gt;

== Physiological arousal ==

To say that our genes influence the formation of a phenotypic trait (i.e., a biological trait that defines a morphological, behavioral, physiological, etc. characteristic) does not mean the same as saying that the trait in question is innate. Very few phenotypic traits are innate (e.g., blood type); the vast majority, including most of those in connection with our biological communication apparatus, need interaction with the environment to be fully and properly developed.&lt;ref name="Kock (2005)"/&gt;

While there is substantial evidence suggesting that our biological communication apparatus is designed for face-to-face communication, there is also ample evidence that such an apparatus (including the neural functional language system) cannot be fully developed without a significant amount of practice. Thus, according to media naturalness theory, evolution must have shaped brain mechanisms to compel human beings to practice the use of their biological communication apparatus; mechanisms that are similar to those compelling animals to practice those skills that play a key role in connection with survival and mating.&lt;ref name="Kock (2005)"/&gt; Among these mechanisms, one of the most important is that of physiological arousal, which is often associated with excitement and pleasure. Engaging in communication interactions, particularly in face-to-face situations, triggers physiological arousal in human beings. Suppression of media naturalness elements makes communication interactions duller than if those elements were present.&lt;ref name="Kock (2005)"/&gt;

== Speech importance ==
Complex speech was enabled by the evolution of a larynx located relatively low in the neck, which considerably increased the variety of sounds that our species could generate; this is actually one of the most important landmarks in the evolution of the human species.&lt;ref name="Kock (2004)"/&gt; However, that adaptive design also significantly increased our ancestors' chances of choking on ingested food and liquids, and suffering from aerodigestive tract diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux. This leads to an interesting conclusion, which is that complex speech must have been particularly important for effective communication in our evolutionary past, otherwise the related evolutionary costs would prevent it from evolving through natural selection.&lt;ref name="Kock (2004)"/&gt; This argument is similar to that made by [[Amotz Zahavi]] in connection with [[Handicap principle|evolutionary handicaps]]. If a trait evolves to improve the effectiveness in connection with a task, in spite of imposing a survival handicap, then the trait should be a particularly strong determinant of the performance in the task to offset the survival cost it imposes.

Media naturalness theory builds on this evolutionary handicap conclusion to predict that the degree to which an electronic communication medium supports an individual's ability to convey and listen to speech is particularly significant in defining its naturalness.&lt;ref name="Kock (2004)"/&gt; Media naturalness theory predicts, through its speech imperative proposition, that speech enablement influences naturalness significantly more than a medium's degree of support for the use of facial expressions and body language.&lt;ref name="Kock (2004)"/&gt; This prediction is consistent with past research showing that removing speech from an electronic communication medium significantly increases the perceived mental effort associated with using the medium to perform knowledge-intensive tasks. According to this prediction, a medium such as audio conferencing is relatively close to the face-to-face medium in terms of naturalness (see Figure 2).

[[Image:Media naturalness theory Fig2.png|500px|thumb|Figure 2. Media naturalness scale.]]

== Compensatory adaptation ==
Increases in cognitive effort and communication ambiguity are usually accompanied by an interesting behavioral phenomenon,  called compensatory adaptation.&lt;ref name="Kock (2007)"/&gt; The phenomenon is characterized by voluntary and involuntary attempts by the individuals involved in a communicative act to compensate for the obstacles posed by an unnatural communication medium. One of the key indications of compensatory adaptation is a decrease in communication fluency, which can be measured through the number of words conveyed per minute through a communication medium. That is, communication fluency is believed to go down as a result of individuals making an effort to adapt their behavior in a compensatory way.&lt;ref name="Kock (2007)"/&gt;

For example, an empirical study suggests that when individuals used instant messaging and face-to-face media to perform complex and knowledge-intensive tasks, the use of the electronic (i.e., instant messaging) medium caused several effects. Those effects were consistent with media naturalness theory, and the compensatory adaptation notion.&lt;ref&gt;Kock, N. (2009). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20650297 Information systems theorizing based on evolutionary psychology: an interdisciplinary review and theory integration framework.] ''[[MIS Quarterly]]'', 33(2), 395-418.&lt;/ref&gt; Among those effects, the electronic medium increased perceived cognitive effort by approximately 40% and perceived communication ambiguity by approximately 80% – as predicted by media naturalness theory. The electronic medium also reduced actual fluency by approximately 80%, and the quality of the task outcomes was not affected, suggesting compensatory adaptation.

[[File:Mundas-et-Infans-frontispiece-1522.png|thumb|The 1522 cover of ''[[The World and the Child|Mundus et Infans]]'', a morality play]]
The '''morality play''' is a [[genre]] of [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and [[Tudor period|early Tudor]] theatrical entertainment. In their own time, these plays were known as '''''interludes''''', a broader term for dramas with or without a [[moral]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Johnston (1991, 97-98).&lt;/ref&gt; Morality plays are a type of [[allegory]] in which the [[protagonist]] is met by [[personification]]s of various [[morality|moral]] attributes who try to prompt him to choose a godly life over one of evil. The plays were most popular in [[Europe]] during the 15th and 16th centuries. Having grown out of the religiously based [[mystery play]]s of the Middle Ages, they represented a shift towards a more secular base for European theatre. [[Hildegard von Bingen]]'s ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]'' (English: "Order of the Virtues") composed c. 1151, is the earliest known morality play by more than a century, and the only Medieval musical drama to survive with an attribution for both the text and the music.

==Characteristics==
Morality plays typically contain a protagonist who represents either humanity as a whole or a smaller social structure. Supporting characters are personifications of good and evil. This alignment of characters provides the play’s audience with moral guidance. Morality plays are the result of the dominant belief of the time period, that humans had a certain amount of control over their post-death fate while they were on earth.&lt;ref&gt;King, Pamela M. "Morality Plays". ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval English Theatre''. Ed. Richard Beadle. Cambridge: Cambridge U P, 1994. 235. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'', perhaps the archetypal morality play, the characters take on the common pattern, representing broader ideas. Some of the characters in ''Everyman'' are God, Death, Everyman, Good-Deeds, Angel, Knowledge, Beauty, Discretion, and Strength. The personified meanings of these characters are hardly hidden. The premise of ''Everyman'' is that God, believing that the people on earth are too focused on wealth and worldly possessions, sends Death to Everyman to remind him of God's power and the importance of upholding values.&lt;ref&gt;''Everyman and Other Miracle and Morality Plays''. Ed. Stanley Appelbaum and Candace Ward. New York: Dover Publications, 1995. 36-59. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis put on morality, the seemingly vast difference between good and evil, and the strong presence of God makes ''Everyman'' one of the most concrete examples of a morality play. At the same time, most morality plays focus more on evil, while ''Everyman'' focuses more on good, highlighting sin in contrast.&lt;ref&gt;King, Pamela M. "Morality Plays". ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval English Theatre''. Ed. Richard Beadle. Cambridge: Cambridge U P, 1994. 257. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other plays that take on the typical traits of morality plays, but are rarely given the title of "morality play" are ''Hickscorner'' and ''The Second Shepherds' Play.'' The characters in ''Hickscorner'' are Pity, Perseverance, Imagination, Contemplation, Freewill, and Hickscorner. They blatantly represent moral ideals.&lt;ref&gt;
Everyman and Other Miracle and Morality Plays. Ed. Stanley Appelbaum and Candace Ward. New York: Dover Publications, 1995. 60. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Second Shepherds' Play'', the characters are less obviously representative of good and evil, being primarily a trio of shepherds. But other characters such as Mary, The Child Christ, and An Angel show a strong moral presence and the importance of God in the play.&lt;ref&gt;

==Justice and Equity as characters==
In early English dramas [[Justice]] was personified as an entity which exercised “theological virtue or grace, and was concerned with the divine pronouncement of judgment on man”.&lt;ref&gt;McCutchan, J. Wilson. "Justice and Equity in the English Morality Play."Journal of the History of Ideas. 19.3 (1958): 406.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as time progressed, more moralities began to emerge; it is during this transitional period where one begins to see [[Justice]] begin to assume more and more the qualities of a judge.  The Justice in ''Respublica'' begins to concern himself with administering justice on “the criminal element”, rather than with the divine pronouncement on a generic representative of mankind.&lt;ref name="Respublica 1905"&gt;''Respublica'', ed. by Leonard A. Magnus (London, 1905), Extra Series XCIV.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first instance where one may observe a direct divergence from the theological virtues and concerns that were previously exerted by Justice in the morality plays of the fifteenth century. The Justice in ''Respublica'' is personified as a “civil force rather than a theological one”.&lt;ref name="Respublica 1905"/&gt; An evolution of sorts takes place within the morals and agendas of Justice, he begins to don on the Judicial Robe of prosecutor and executioner.

Another change envelops in the character of Justice during the sixteenth century in morality plays; [[Equity (law)|Equity]] replaces Justice and assumes the judiciary duties previously performed by Justice. This changing of rulers, or preceding justices, is done when Equity declares that his brother Justice has been banished from the country and that he (Equity) will from now on take on the duties of the former monarch, Justice.&lt;ref&gt;McCutchan, J. Wilson . "Justice and Equity in the English Morality Play."Journal of the History of Ideas. 19.3 (1958): 408.&lt;/ref&gt; This change of ruling heads is portrayed in the morality play, ''Liberality and Prodigality'', where Equity serves Virtue in the detection, arrest, and punishment of Prodigality for the robbery and murder of Tenacity, a yeoman in the country of Middlesex.&lt;ref&gt;''Liberality and Prodigality'', in ''A Select Collection of Old English Plays''. ed. by W. Carew Hazlitt (London, 1874), VIII, 329-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Virtue states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
So horrible a fact can hardly pleaded for favour:&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore go you, Equity, examine more diligently&lt;br /&gt;
The manner of this outrageous robbery:&lt;br /&gt;
And as the same by examination shall appear,&lt;br /&gt;
Due justice may be done in presence here.&lt;br /&gt; (''Liberality and Prodigality'' 377)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The meta phases that Justice undergoes during the sixteenth century in morality plays, from “Justice” to “Equity” further illustrates the evolution of Justice; not only did Justice change from a “theological abstraction to a civil servant”,&lt;ref&gt;McCutchan, J. Wilson . "Justice and Equity in the English Morality Play."Journal of the History of Ideas. 19.3 (1958): 409.&lt;/ref&gt; but he experienced a corporeal change as well.

One may readily observe the evolutionary progression of Justice as portrayed in the plays of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. One encounters Justice in the early-fifteenth-century moralities as a performer playing the role of a theological virtue or grace, and then one sees him develop to a more serious figure, occupying the position of an arbiter of justice during the sixteenth century. It is a journey of discovery and great change on which Justice welcomes one to embark as one leafs through the pages of morality plays.

==Pre-Reformation versus post-Reformation==
Although the purpose of all morality plays is to instruct listeners on the means of receiving redemption, morality plays after the [[Protestant Reformation]] are of a distinctly different [[didacticism]] than the morality plays before the Reformation.

Morality plays before the Reformation teach a [[Catholic Church |Catholic]] approach to redemption, with an emphasis on works and the sacraments, a view originating with [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 – c. 240 AD) and [[Cyprian]] (d. 258). The emphasis on works can be seen in the final speech in one of the most well-known of medieval morality plays, [[Everyman (play)|Everyman]], in which there is a clear statement about the necessity of good works for the one who desires heaven:
&lt;poem&gt; 
Doctor:  This moral men may have in mind;
Ye hearers, take it of worth, old and young,
And forsake pride, for he deceiveth you in the end,
And remember Beauty, Five-wits, Strength, and Discretion,
They all at last do Everyman forsake,
Save his Good-Deeds, there doth he take.
But beware, and they be small
Before God, he hath no help at all.
None excuse may be there for Everyman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cawley |first=A. C.|title=Everyman and Medieval Miracle Plays |date=1974 |publisher= Dent |location=London |isbn=978-0-460-87280-5 |page =225}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
The importance of the sacraments is seen in the morality tale entitled [[Mankind (play)]].  In this play, the [[sacrament of penance]] is emphasized when the allegorical character Mercy speaks to Mankind:  “Come let us go to this cloister and incline your mind towards God.  Don’t sin thinking that you are assured mercy, that itself is a sin.  It’s not a good idea to take advantage of the Lord.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= McDonald |first1= Rick |title= Modern English Translation of Mankind |url= http://research.uvu.edu/mcdonald/3610/mankind.html |publisher =Utah Valley University|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Pre-Reformation plays emphasized the importance of the [[sacraments of the Catholic Church]] (such as partaking in mass and baptism), the church clergy, the church hierarchy, the church establishment in general, and the abstinence from the [[Seven Deadly Sins]]. Many of the morality tales were [[allegory |allegories]] and involved characters with names of Vices (e.g., Gluttony) and Virtues (e.g., Goodness).  Their purpose was to direct the playgoers to pursue virtue and renounce vice.

Frequently a character representing a Vice would state, upon his first appearance, that he was evil.  For example, in [[The Castle of Perseverance]], a character called Lust-Liking states:
&lt;poem&gt;
Lo, me! here ready Lord, to fare and to flee
To seek thee a servant valued and dear!
Whoso will by Folly ruled be, 
He is worthy to be a servant here,
Who slips into the Sins Seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Johnston |first =Alexandra F.|title=The Castle of Perseverance: A Modernization |url= http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~ajohnsto/cascomp.html |website= Computing in the Humanities and Social Sciences |publisher= University of Toronto|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
Even after this initial introduction, however, the Vice will continually reiterate to the audience that his nature is diabolic. Very often, the Vice presented will bring his character into criticism by the manner in which he presents himself to his audience, thus further demonstrating his wickedness. For example, the Vices in the earlier morality plays often spoke using vulgar language and by blasphemous swearing.  Often, these curses were spoken in [[Latin]], which being considered the holy language, made these curses even more offensive to the audience.  Moreover, the Vices often made a mockery of religious practices sacred to the audience, thereby castigating themselves in the eyes of their audience. Deceit is another means by which the Vice exposes his wickedness to the audience and serves as an example to them of what to avoid in a righteous life. Furthermore, in the pre-Reformation play, the Vices denounce their own characters by acting violently toward each other, and toward the Virtues.&lt;ref name= "Pineas, Rainer 1962"&gt;{{Citation | last = Pineas | first = Rainer | title = The English Morality Play as a Weapon of Religious Controversy | journal = Studies in English Literature | volume = 2 | number = 2 | year = 1962 | pages = 157–80 | publisher = JSTOR | format = Web | accessdate = 28 September 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the pre-Reformation morality plays sought to reinforce the establishment of the Catholic Church and Catholic doctrine, the post-Reformation morality plays worked to destroy Catholic credibility and demonise the Catholic Church.  Although post-Reformation morality plays were like its predecessor in that it also was concerned with the salvation of its audience, it differed in that it believed that the theology promoted by pre-Reformation plays was antithetical to salvation. Thus, a major shift in focus, from concern for the individual’s moral behaviour to concern for the individual's theological practices, occurred with the post-Reformation morality plays. The wave of [[Protestantism]] which fuelled the content of these plays dictated that more attention should be given to warning people against the Catholic Church than of their sinful nature.  The means of redemption, according to the philosophy embedded in post-Reformation morality plays, is dependent upon the audience understanding the truthfulness of Protestant theology and verses and also the deceptiveness and wickedness of Catholic theology, whose best example is the secular play of Calderón.&lt;ref name="Muratta Bunsen, Eduardo 2014"&gt;{{Citation | last = Muratta Bunsen | first = Eduardo | title = Leidenschaft des Zweifelns: Skepsis und Probabilismus in den Säkulardramen von Pedro Calderón de la Barca | language = de | publisher = FU | place = Berlin, DE | url = http://www.geisteswissenschaften.fu-berlin.de/we05/forschung/dissertationen/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vices in post-Reformation morality plays are almost always depicted as being Catholic. At times this depiction is achieved through their physical appearance. For example, Vices in post-Reformation morality plays would be dressed as cardinals, friars, monks, or the pope. Other times, the Vice comes out and states he is a Catholic, or elucidates that he is Catholic by swearing a Catholic pledge.  Oftentimes, the Vice in post-Reformation plays admits that Catholic theology is flawed, and that by being Catholic the Vice is committing treason.  Moreover, Vices often appear ignorant and naive, especially when it comes to their biblical understanding and knowledge of the [[New Testament]]. Often, morality plays coming out the post-Reformation period ridicule ritualistic Catholic practices. Furthermore, these plays postulated that Catholics were opposed to moral behaviour and truthfulness, and that the Catholic Church warped the text of the Bible to justify sinning. To deceive the victim of post-Reformation morality plays, the Vice typically assumes a new name to disguise what actual Vice he is.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Because the Vice is aggressively tied to Catholicism from the outset of the play, when the Vice is reprimanded and damned, so are his Catholic beliefs. Therefore, the Vice served as a central component to discrediting the Catholic Church in post-Reformation morality plays.&lt;ref name= "Pineas, Rainer 1962" /&gt;

The role of the Virtues in post-Reformation morality plays was to preach a message of salvation based upon an individual’s faith and the grace of God. They promoted Protestant beliefs of [[original sin]], the importance of bible reading and meditation, the marriage of clergymen, and the cleansing of sin only through Christ’s sacrifice; at the same time, they discredited the Catholic belief in [[transubstantiation]].&lt;ref name= "Pineas, Rainer 1962" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2691">{{About|a concept in psychology}}
The '''nascent state''' (''Statu Nascenti'') is defined as a psychological process of destructuration-[[reorganization]] where the individual becomes capable of merging with other persons and creating a new collectivity with a very high degree of [[social solidarity|solidarity]]. This concept was first defined by [[Francesco Alberoni]], a prominent Italian [[sociologist]], journalist, and professor in [[Sociology]], in his book ''Statu Nascenti''. However, the concept is referred to in much of his work. In his book ''Falling in Love and Loving'', Alberoni defends that there are similarities to be found between massive collective movements and love relationships:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Up till now, sociologists, psychologists, and philosophers have displayed a sort of repugnance or embarrassment in admitting that there is something in common—or better, something identical—to be found both in great historical processes like Islam, the French Revolution, or the Russian Revolution and in such personal, banal phenomena as the experience of falling in love. [...]

In an analogous way, the falling-in-love process is the simplest form of a collective movement. [...]

The definition given of the falling-in-love process (i.e. the nascent state of a collective movement made up of two people) offers us a theoretical slot in which to position this mysterious phenomenon of collective movements. Not only, but the same definition provides us with an extraordinary tool for investigating the nature of all such movements.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Therefore, [[falling in love]] is seen as the nascent state of a collective movement formed of two people only. According to [[Francesco Alberoni]], the [[Phenomenology (sociology)|phenomenology]] of falling in love is the same for young people and adults, for men and women and for homosexuals and heterosexuals. This is because the structure of the nascent state is always the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17040">In [[philosophy]] and [[mathematics]], '''Newcomb's paradox''', also referred to as '''Newcomb's problem''', is a [[thought experiment]] involving a game between two players, one of whom purports to be able to predict the future. Whether the problem actually is a [[paradox]] is disputed.

Newcomb's paradox was created by [[William Newcomb]] of the [[University of California]]'s [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratory]]. However, it was first analyzed and was published in a philosophy paper spread to the philosophical community by [[Robert Nozick]] in 1969,&lt;ref name='nozick'&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Nozick|title=Essays in Honor of Carl G Hempel|chapter=Newcomb's Problem and Two Principles of Choice|url=http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/rjohns/nozick_newcomb.pdf|editor-last=Rescher|editor-first=Nicholas|year=1969|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in the March 1973 issue of Scientific American, in [[Martin Gardner]]'s "[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]."&lt;ref name='sciam'&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Scientific American|author=Gardner, Martin|date=March 1974|title=Mathematical Games|at=p. 102}} Reprinted with an addendum and annotated bibliography in his book ''The Colossal Book of Mathematics'' ({{ISBN|0-393-02023-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is a much debated problem in the philosophical branch of [[decision theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Causal Decision Theory|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-causal/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The problem==
There is a predictor, a player, and two boxes designated A and B. The player is given a choice between taking only box B, or taking both boxes A and B. The player knows the following:&lt;ref name="Wolpert"&gt;{{cite journal |first=D. H. |last=Wolpert |first2=G. |last2=Benford |title=The lesson of Newcomb's paradox |journal=[[Synthese]]|date=June 2013 |volume=190 |issue=9 |pages=1637–1646 |doi=10.1007/s11229-011-9899-3 |jstor=41931515}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Box A is clear, and always contains a visible $1,000.
* Box B is opaque, and its content has already been set by the predictor:
** If the predictor has predicted the player will take both boxes A and B, then box B contains nothing.
** If the predictor has predicted that the player will take only box B, then box B contains $1,000,000.
Even while the player knows the above, he does not know what prediction has been made prior to his making a choice.

==Game theory strategies==
{| class="wikitable"
! Predicted choice !! Actual choice !! Payout
|-
|A + B || A + B || $1,000
|-
|A + B || B || $0
|-
|B || A + B || $1,001,000
|-
|B || B || $1,000,000
|}
In his 1969 article, Nozick noted that "To almost everyone, it is perfectly clear and obvious what should be done. The difficulty is that these people seem to divide almost evenly on the problem, with large numbers thinking that the opposing half is just being silly."&lt;ref name="Wolpert" /&gt; The problem continues to divide philosophers today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bellos|first1=Alex|title=Newcomb's problem divides philosophers. Which side are you on?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2016/nov/28/newcombs-problem-divides-philosophers-which-side-are-you-on|accessdate=13 April 2018|work=the Guardian|date=28 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourget, D., &amp; Chalmers, D. J. (2014). What do philosophers believe?. Philosophical Studies, 170(3), 465-500.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Game theory]] offers two strategies for this game that rely on different principles: the [[expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]] principle and the [[strategic dominance]] principle. The problem is called a ''paradox'' because two analyses that both sound intuitively logical give conflicting answers to the question of what choice maximizes the player's payout.
* Considering the expected utility when the probability of the predictor being right is almost certain or certain, the player should choose box B. This choice statistically maximizes the player's winnings, setting them at about $1,000,000 per game.
* Under the dominance principle, the player should choose the strategy that is ''always'' better; choosing both boxes A and B will ''always'' yield $1,000 more than only choosing B. However, the expected utility of "always $1,000 more than B" depends on the statistical payout of the game; when the predictor's prediction is almost certain or certain, choosing both A and B sets player's winnings at about $1,000 per game.

[[David Wolpert]] and [[Gregory Benford]] suggest that there is no conflict between the two strategies; Newcomb's problem actually represents two different games with different probabilistic outcomes, and the conflict arises because of this imprecise definition of the game. They also note that the optimal strategy for either of the games does not depend on the infallibility of the predictor, and the questions of causality, determinism, and free will do not factor into these strategies.&lt;ref name="Wolpert" /&gt;

==Causality and free will==
{| class="wikitable"
! Predicted choice !! Actual choice !! Payout
|-
|A + B || A + B || $1,000
|-
|B || B || $1,000,000
|}
Causality issues arise when the predictor is posited as [[infallible]] and incapable of error; Nozick avoids this issue by positing that the predictor's predictions are "''almost'' certainly" correct, thus sidestepping any issues of infallibility and causality. Nozick also stipulates that if the predictor predicts that the player will choose randomly, then box B will contain nothing. This assumes that inherently random or unpredictable events would not come into play anyway during the process of making the choice, such as [[free will]] or [[quantum mind]] processes.&lt;ref name='langan'&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Noesis|author=Christopher Langan|issue=44|title=The Resolution of Newcomb's Paradox|url=http://megasociety.org/noesis/44/newcomb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these issues can still be explored in the case of an infallible predictor. Under this condition, it seems that taking only B is the correct option. This analysis argues that we can ignore the possibilities that return $0 and $1,001,000, as they both require that the predictor has made an incorrect prediction, and the problem states that the predictor is never wrong. Thus, the choice becomes whether to take both boxes with $1,000 or to take only box B with $1,000,000—so taking only box B is always better.

[[William Lane Craig]] has suggested that, in a world with perfect predictors (or [[Time travel|time machines]], because a time machine could be used as a mechanism for making a prediction), [[retrocausality]] can occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Craig |year=1987 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/newcomb.html |title=Divine Foreknowledge and Newcomb's Paradox |journal=Philosophia |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=331–350 |doi=10.1007/BF02455055}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person truly knows the future, and that knowledge affects their actions, then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. The chooser's choice will have already ''caused'' the predictor's action. Some have concluded that if time machines or perfect predictors can exist, then there can be no [[free will]] and choosers will do whatever they're fated to do. Taken together, the paradox is a restatement of the old contention that free will and [[determinism]] are incompatible, since determinism enables the existence of perfect predictors. Put another way, this paradox can be equivalent to the [[grandfather paradox]]; the paradox presupposes a perfect predictor, implying the "chooser" is not free to choose, yet simultaneously presumes a choice can be debated and decided. This suggests to some that the paradox is an artifact of these contradictory assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Craig |first=William Lane |authorlink=William Lane Craig |year=1988 |title=Tachyons, Time Travel, and Divine Omniscience |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=135–150 |jstor=2027068|doi=10.2307/2027068 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gary Drescher]] argues in his book ''Good and Real'' that the correct decision is to take only box B, by appealing to a situation he argues is analogous—a rational agent in a deterministic universe deciding whether or not to cross a potentially busy street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Drescher |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Drescher |year=2006 |title=Good and Real: Demystifying Paradoxes from Physics to Ethics |isbn=978-0262042338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew David Irvine|Andrew Irvine]] argues that the problem is structurally isomorphic to [[Braess' paradox]], a non-intuitive but ultimately non-paradoxical result concerning equilibrium points in physical systems of various kinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Irvine |title=How Braess' paradox solves Newcomb's problem |journal=International Studies in the Philosophy of Science |volume=7 |issue=2 |year=1993 |pages=141–60 |doi=10.1080/02698599308573460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influencing the predictor==
Simon Burgess has argued that we need to recognize two stages to the problem. The first stage is that before which the predictor has gained all the information on which the prediction will be based. If, for example, we suppose that the prediction is at least partially based on a brain scan of the player then the first stage will not be over at least until that brain scan has been taken. An important point to appreciate is that while the player is still in that first stage, they will presumably be able to influence the predictor's prediction (e.g., by committing to taking only one box). The second stage commences after the completion of the brain scan (and/or after the gathering of any other information on which the prediction is based). As Burgess points out, the first stage is the one in which all of us currently find ourselves. Moreover, there is a clear sense in which the first stage is more significant than the second because it is then that the player can determine whether the $1,000,000 is in box B. Once they get to the second stage, the best that can be done is to determine whether to get the $1,000 in box A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess|first=Simon|title=Newcomb's problem: an unqualified resolution|journal=Synthese|date=January 2004|volume=138|issue=2|pages=261–287|doi=10.1023/b:synt.0000013243.57433.e7 |jstor=20118389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those persuaded by Burgess's approach do not say either that it is simply rational to take just box B or that it is conversely rational to take both boxes, but
rather argue a player should make their decision while in the first stage and that that decision should be to commit to only box B. Once in the second stage, the rational decision would be to take both boxes, although by that stage the player should already have made up their mind to take just box B. Burgess has repeatedly emphasized that he is not arguing that the player should change their mind on getting to the second stage. The safe and rational strategy to adopt is to simply make a commitment to just box B while in the first stage and to have no intention of wavering from that commitment, i.e., make an 'unqualified resolution'. Burgess points out that those who make no such commitment and therefore miss out on the $1,000,000 have simply failed to be prepared. In a more recent paper Burgess has explained that, given his analysis, Newcomb's problem should be seen as being akin to the [[Kavka's toxin puzzle|toxin puzzle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess|first=Simon|title=Newcomb's problem and its conditional evidence: a common cause of confusion|journal=Synthese |date=February 2012 |volume=184 |issue=3 |pages=319–339 |doi=10.1007/s11229-010-9816-1 |jstor=41411196}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because both problems highlight the fact that one can have a reason to intend to do something without having a reason to actually do it.

With regard to causal structure, Burgess has consistently followed Ellery Eells and others in treating Newcomb's problem as a common cause problem. Contrary to David Lewis, he argues against the idea that Newcomb's problem is another version of the [[prisoner's dilemma]]. Burgess's argument on this point emphasizes the contrasting causal structures of the two problems.

==Consciousness==
Newcomb's paradox can also be related to the question of machine consciousness, specifically if a perfect simulation of a person's brain will generate the consciousness of that person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |first=R. M. |last=Neal |title=Puzzles of Anthropic Reasoning Resolved Using Full Non-indexical Conditioning |work=|eprint=math.ST/0608592  |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose we take the predictor to be a machine that arrives at its prediction by simulating the brain of the chooser when confronted with the problem of which box to choose. If that simulation generates the consciousness of the chooser, then the chooser cannot tell whether they are standing in front of the boxes in the real world or in the virtual world generated by the simulation in the past. The "virtual" chooser would thus tell the predictor which choice the "real" chooser is going to make.

==Fatalism==
Newcomb's paradox is related to [[fatalism|logical fatalism]] in that they both suppose absolute certainty of the future. In logical fatalism, this assumption of certainty creates circular reasoning ("a future event is certain to happen, therefore it is certain to happen"), while Newcomb's paradox considers whether the participants of its game are able to affect a predestined outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|publisher=Clarendon Press Oxford|year=1996|pages=352–358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extensions to Newcomb's problem==
Many thought experiments similar to or based on Newcomb's problem have been discussed in the literature.&lt;ref name='nozick'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Yudkowsky-TDT'&gt;[http://intelligence.org/files/TDT.pdf Timeless Decision Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a quantum-theoretical version of Newcomb's problem in which box B is [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] with box A has been proposed.&lt;ref name='Piotrowski'&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Quantum Information|volume=1|issue=3|year=2003|pages=395–402|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S0219749903000279|author1=Piotrowski, Edward|author2=Jan Sladowski |title=Quantum solution to the Newcomb's paradox|doi=10.1142/S0219749903000279|arxiv=quant-ph/0202074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The meta-Newcomb problem===
Another related problem is the meta-Newcomb problem.&lt;ref name='bostrom'&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Analysis|volume=61|issue=4|author=Bostrom, Nick|year=2001|title=The Meta-Newcomb Problem|pages=309–310|doi=10.1093/analys/61.4.309}}&lt;/ref&gt; The setup of this problem is similar to the original Newcomb problem. However, the twist here is that the predictor may elect to decide whether to fill box B after the player has made a choice, and the player does not know whether box B has already been filled. There is also another predictor: a "meta-predictor" who has correctly predicted ''every'' outcome in the past, and who predicts the following: "Either you will choose both boxes, and the predictor will make its decision after you, or you will choose only box B, and the predictor will already have made its decision."

In this situation, a proponent of choosing both boxes is faced with the following dilemma: if the player chooses both boxes, the predictor will not yet have made its decision, and therefore a more rational choice would be for the player to choose box B only. But if the player so chooses, the predictor will already have made its decision, making it impossible for the player's decision to affect the predictor's decision.&lt;ref name='Yudkowsky-TDT'/&gt;

The Act required states to develop assessments in basic skills. To receive federal school funding, states had to give these assessments to all students at select grade levels.

The act did not assert a national achievement standard—each state developed its own standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Child Left Behind|url=http://www.scoe.org/pub/htdocs/nclb.html|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCLB expanded the federal role in public education through further emphasis on annual testing, annual academic progress, report cards, and teacher qualifications, as well as significant changes in funding.&lt;ref name="No Child Left Behind"/&gt;

The bill passed in the Congress with bipartisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/1 |title=To close the achievement gap with accountability, flexibility, and choice, so that no child is left behind.|date=2001-03-22 |publisher=Library of Congress&lt;!--|publisher-url=https://www.congress.gov/--&gt;|accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, criticism from right, left, and center had accumulated so much that a [[bipartisan Congress]] stripped away the national features of No Child Left Behind.

==Provisions of the act==
No Child Left Behind requires all public schools receiving federal funding to administer a statewide [[standardized test]] annually to all students. Schools that receive [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act#Title|Title I]] funding through the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965]] must make [[Adequate Yearly Progress]] (AYP) in test scores (e.g. each year, fifth graders must do better on standardized tests than the previous year's fifth graders).

If the school's results are repeatedly poor, then steps are taken to improve the school.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Erin &amp; Rotherham, Andy. [http://www.educationsector.org/research/research_show.htm?doc_id=511096 "States' Evidence: What It Means to Make 'Adequate Yearly Progress' Under NCLB"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124025205/http://www.educationsector.org/research/research_show.htm?doc_id=511096 |date=2010-01-24 }}. Retrieved August 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Schools that miss AYP for a second consecutive year are publicly labeled as "In Need of Improvement," and must develop a two-year improvement plan for the subject that the school is not teaching well. Students have the option to transfer to a better school within the school district, if any exists.
* Missing AYP in the third year forces the school to offer free tutoring and other supplemental education services to students who are struggling.
* If a school misses its AYP target for a fourth consecutive year, the school is labelled as requiring "corrective action," which might involve wholesale replacement of staff, introduction of a new curriculum, or extending the amount of time students spend in class.
* A fifth year of failure results in planning to restructure the entire school; the plan is implemented if the school unsuccessfully hits its AYP targets for the sixth consecutive year. Common options include closing the school, turning the school into a [[charter school]], hiring a private company to run the school, or asking the state office of education to run the school directly.

States must create AYP objectives consistent with the following requirements of the law:&lt;ref name="American Educational Research Assosiation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linn|first=Robert L.|author2=Eva L. Baker |author3=Damian W Betebenner |title=Accountability Systems: Implications of Requirements of the No Child Left behind Act of 2001|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=31|date= Aug–Sep 2002|issue=6|pages=3–16|jstor=3594432|doi=10.3102/0013189x031006003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# States must develop AYP statewide measurable objectives for improved achievement by all students and for specific groups: economically disadvantaged students, students with disabilities, and students with [[limited English proficiency]].
# The objectives must be set with the goal of having all students at the proficient level or above within 12 years (i.e. by the end of the 2013–14 school year).
# AYP must be primarily based on state assessments, but must also include one additional academic indicator.
# The AYP objectives must be assessed at the school level. Schools that failed to meet their AYP objective for two consecutive years are identified for improvement.
# School AYP results must be reported separately for each group of students identified above so that it can be determined whether each student group met the AYP objective.
# At least 95% of each group must participate in state assessments.
# States may aggregate up to three years of data in making AYP determinations.

The act requires states to provide "[[Highly Qualified Teachers|highly qualified]]" teachers to all students. Each state sets its own standards for what counts as "highly qualified." Similarly, the act requires states to set "one high, challenging standard" for its students. Each state decides for itself what counts as "one high, challenging standard," but the curriculum standards must be applied to all students, rather than having different standards for students in different cities or other parts of the state.

The act also requires schools to let military recruiters have students' contact information and other access to the student, if the school provides that information to universities or employers, unless the students opt out of giving military recruiters access. This portion of the law has drawn lots of criticism and has even led to political resistance. For instance, in 2003 in [[Santa Cruz, California]], student-led efforts forced school districts to create an "opt-in" policy that required students affirm they wanted the military to have their information. This successful student organizing effort was copied in various other cities throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2003/04/23/32recruit.h22.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on teachers, schools, and school districts==

===Increased accountability===
Supporters of the NCLB claim one of the strong positive points of the bill is the increased accountability that is required of schools and teachers. According to the legislation, schools must pass yearly tests that judge student improvement over the fiscal year. These yearly standardized tests are the main means of determining whether schools live up to required standards. If required improvements are not made, the schools face decreased funding and other punishments that contribute to the increased accountability. According to supporters, these goals help teachers and schools realize the significance and importance of the educational system and how it affects the nation. Opponents of this law say that the punishments only hurt the schools and do not contribute to the improvement of student education.

In addition to and in support of the above points, proponents claim that No Child Left Behind:
* Links state academic content standards with student outcomes
* Measures student performance: a student's progress in reading and math must be measured annually in grades 3 through 8 and at least once during high school via [[standardized test]]s
* Provides information for parents by requiring states and school districts to give parents detailed report cards on schools and districts explaining the school's AYP performance; schools must inform parents when their child is taught by a teacher or para-professional who does not meet "highly qualified" requirements
* Establishes the foundation for schools and school districts to significantly enhance parental involvement and improved administration through the use of the assessment data to drive decisions on instruction, curriculum and business practices

The commonwealth of Pennsylvania has proposed tying teacher's salaries to test scores.  If a district's students do poorly, the state cuts the district's budget the following year and the teachers get a pay cut. Critics point out that if a school does poorly, reducing its budget and cutting teacher salaries will likely hamper the school's ability to improve.

===School choice===
* Gives options to students enrolled in schools failing to meet AYP. If a school fails to meet AYP targets two or more years running, the school must offer eligible children the chance to transfer to higher-performing local schools, receive free tutoring, or attend after-school programs.
* Gives school districts the opportunity to demonstrate proficiency, even for subgroups that do not meet State Minimum Achievement standards, through a process called "safe harbor," a precursor to growth-based or [[value-added modeling|value-added assessments]].

===Narrow definition of research===
The act requires schools to rely on [[scientifically based research]] for programs and teaching methods.  The act defines this as "research that involves the application of rigorous, systematic, and objective procedures to obtain reliable and valid knowledge relevant to education activities and programs." Scientifically based research results in "replicable and applicable findings" from research that used appropriate methods to generate persuasive, empirical conclusions.&lt;ref name=Beghetto&gt;Beghetto, R. (2003) [http://www.ericdigests.org/2003-5/based.htm Scientifically Based Research.] ERIC Clearinghouse on Educational Management. Retrieved June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality and distribution of teachers===
Prior to the NCLB act, new teachers were typically required to have a bachelor's degree, be fully certified, and demonstrate subject matter knowledge—generally through tests. It is widely accepted&lt;ref&gt;Citation needed&lt;/ref&gt; that teacher knowledge has two components: specific subject matter knowledge (CK) such as an understanding of mathematics for a mathematics teacher, and pedagogical knowledge (PCK), which is knowledge of the subject of teaching/learning itself. Both types of knowledge, as well as experience in guided student teaching, help form the qualities needed by effective teachers.

Under NCLB, existing teachers—including those with tenure—were also supposed to meet standards. They could meet the same requirements set for new teachers or could meet a state-determined "...high, objective, uniform state standard of evaluation," aka HOUSSE. Downfall of the quality requirements of the NCLB legislation have received little research attention, in part because state rules require few changes from pre-existing practice. There is also little evidence that the rules have altered trends in observable teacher traits.&lt;ref name="American Economic Assosiation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanushek|first=Eric A.|author2=Steven G. Rivkin |title=The Quality and Distribution of Teachers under the No Child Left Behind Act|journal=The Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=24|date= Summer 2010|issue=3|pages=133–50|jstor=20799159|doi=10.1257/jep.24.3.133|url=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.24.3.133}}&lt;/ref&gt; For years, American educators have been struggling to identify those teacher traits that are important contributors to student achievement. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what traits are most important and most education policy experts agree that further research is required.

==Effects on student assessment==
Several analyses of state accountability systems that were in place before NCLB indicate that outcomes accountability led to faster growth in achievement for the states that introduced such systems.&lt;ref&gt;See the analyses of NAEP results in Martin Carnoy and Susanna Loeb, "Does external accountability affect student outcomes? A cross-state analysis," ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis'' 24, no. 4 (Winter 2002): 305–31, and [[Eric Hanushek|Eric A. Hanushek]] and Margaret E. Raymond, "Does school accountability lead to improved student performance?" ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'' 24, no. 2 (Spring 2005): 297–327.&lt;/ref&gt;  The direct analysis of state test scores before and after enactment of NCLB also supports its positive impact.&lt;ref&gt;Center on Education Policy, ''Answering the Question That Matters Most: Has Student Achievement Increased Since No Child Left Behind?''  Washington:  Center on Education Policy, June 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; A primary criticism asserts that NCLB reduces effective instruction and student learning by causing states to lower achievement goals and motivate teachers to "teach to the test."  A primary supportive claim asserts that systematic testing provides data that shed light on which schools don't teach basic skills effectively, so that interventions can be made to improve outcomes for all students while reducing the achievement gap for disadvantaged and disabled students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/schools/nochild/ List of articles regarding NCLB debate]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improved test scores==
The Department of Education points to the [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]] (NAEP) results, released in July 2005, showing improved student achievement in reading and math:&lt;ref&gt;(2006) [http://www.ed.gov/nclb/overview/importance/nclbworking.html No Child Left Behind Act Is Working] Department of Education. Retrieved 6/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt;
* More progress was made by nine-year-olds in reading in the last five years than in the previous 28 years combined.
* America's nine-year-olds posted the best scores in reading (since 1971) and math  (since 1973) in the history of the report. America's 13-year-olds earned the highest math scores the test ever recorded.
* Reading and math scores for [[African American|black]] and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] nine-year-olds reached an all-time high.
* Achievement gaps in reading and math between white and black nine-year-olds and between white and Hispanic nine-year-olds are at an all-time low.
* Forty-three states and the District of Columbia either improved academically or held steady in all categories (fourth- and eighth-grade reading and fourth- and eighth-grade math).

These statistics compare 2005 with 2000 though No Child Left Behind did not even take effect until 2003. Critics point out that the increase in scores between 2000 and 2005 was roughly the same as the increase between 2003 and 2005, which calls into question how any increase can be attributed to No Child Left Behind. They also argue that some of the subgroups are [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry-picked]]—that in other subgroups scores remained the same or fell.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Perlstein, ''Tested''&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the makers of the standardized tests have been blamed for making the tests easier so that it is easier for schools to sufficiently improve.

Education researchers Thomas Dee and Brian Jacob argue that NCLB showed statistically significant positive impact on students' performance on 4th-grade math exams (equal to two-thirds of a year's worth of growth), smaller and statistically insignificant improvements in 8th-grade math exam performance, and no discernible improvement in reading performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|url=http://educationnext.org/evaluating-nclb/|title=Evaluating No Child Left Behind|first1=Thomas|last1=Dee|first2=Brian|last2=Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms of standardized testing===
Critics argue that the focus on [[standardized test]]ing (all students in a state take the same test under the same conditions) encourages teachers to teach a narrow subset of skills that the school believes increases [[Test preparation|test performance]], rather than achieve in-depth understanding of the overall curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.reading.org/resources/issues/positions_high_stakes.html High-Stakes Assessments in Reading] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827061209/http://www.reading.org/resources/issues/positions_high_stakes.html |date=2006-08-27 }}. International Reading Association. Retrieved June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a teacher who knows that all questions on a math test are simple addition problems (e.g., What is 2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3?) might not invest any class time on the practical applications of addition, to leave more time for the material the test assesses. This is colloquially referred to as "[[teaching to the test]]."  "Teaching to the test" has been observed to raise test scores, though not as much as other teaching techniques.&lt;ref name=MET&gt;{{cite journal

Many teachers who practice "teaching to the test" misinterpret the educational outcomes the tests are designed to measure. On two state tests, [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Michigan]], and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) almost two-thirds of eighth graders missed math word problems that required an application of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] to calculate the distance between two points.&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins, G. &amp; McTighe, J. (2005). Understanding by design, 2nd Edition. ASCD. {{ISBN|978-1-4166-0035-0}}. pp. 42–43&lt;/ref&gt;  The teachers correctly anticipated the content of the tests, but incorrectly assumed each test would present simplistic items rather than higher-order items.

Another problem is that outside influences often affect student performance.  Students who struggle to take tests may perform well using another method of learning such as project-based learning.  Sometimes, factors such as home life can affect test performance.  Basing performance on one test inaccurately measures student success overall.  No Child Left behind has failed to account for all these factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-child-has-failed/2015/02/13/8d619026-b2f8-11e4-827f-93f454140e2b_story.html|title=‘No Child’ has failed|last=Eskelsen García|first=Lily|last2=Thornton|first2=Otha|date=February 13, 2015|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Those opposed to the use of testing to determine educational achievement prefer alternatives such as subjective teacher opinions, classwork, and [[Educational assessment|performance-based assessments]].&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.fairtest.org/facts/whatwron.htm What's Wrong With Standardized Testing?] FairTest.org. Retrieved June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under No Child Left Behind, schools were held almost exclusively accountable for absolute levels of student performance.  But that meant that even schools that were making great strides with students were still labeled as "failing" just because the students had not yet made it all the way to a "proficient" level of achievement.  Since 2005, the U.S. Department of Education has approved 15 states to implement growth model pilots.  Each state adopted one of four distinct growth models: Trajectory, Transition Tables, Student Growth Percentiles, and Projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carey|first=Kevin|title=Growth Models and Accountability: A Recipe for Remaking ESEA|journal=Education Sector|date=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incentives for improvement also may cause states to lower their official standards. Because each state can produce its own standardized tests, a state can make its statewide tests easier to increase scores.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://ed.sc.gov/news/more.cfm?articleID=385 New study confirms vast differences in state goals for academic ‘proficiency’ under NCLB].

Many argue that local government had failed students, necessitating federal intervention to remedy issues like teachers teaching outside their areas of expertise, and complacency in the face of continually failing schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mizell, H|year=2003|url=http://www.middleweb.com/HMnclb.html|title=NCLB: Conspiracy, Compliance, or Creativity?|accessdate=2007-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713071731/http://www.middleweb.com/HMnclb.html|archive-date=2007-07-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some local governments, notably that of New York state, have supported NCLB provisions, because local standards failed to provide adequate oversight over special education, and NCLB would let them use longitudinal data more effectively to monitor [[Adequate Yearly Progress]] (AYP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oms.nysed.gov/legcoord/fedleg05/body.html#no%20child|title=Federal Legislation and Education in New York State 2005: No Child Left Behind Act|year=2005|publisher=New York State Education Agency|accessdate=2007-06-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509143713/http://www.oms.nysed.gov/legcoord/fedleg05/body.html#no%20child|archivedate=2007-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; States all over the United States have shown improvements in their progress as an apparent result of NCLB. For example, Wisconsin ranks first of all fifty states plus the District of Columbia, with ninety-eight percent of its schools achieving No Child Left Behind standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2008/state.php?state=WI |title=NPR and Newshour 2008 Election Map: More about Wisconsin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality of education===
* Increases the quality of education by requiring schools to improve their performance
* Improves quality of instruction by requiring schools to implement "scientifically based research" practices in the classroom, parent involvement programs, and professional development activities for those students that are not encouraged or expected to attend college.
* Supports early literacy through the Early Reading First initiative.
* Emphasizes reading, language arts, mathematics and science achievement as "core academic subjects."&lt;ref name="test"&gt;United States. Public Law 107-110. 107th Congress, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
Student performance in other subjects (besides reading and math) will be measured as a part of overall progress.

===Effect on arts and electives===
NCLB’s main focus is on skills in reading, writing, and mathematics, which are areas related to economic success.  Combined with the budget crises in the [[late-2000s recession]], some schools have cut or eliminated classes and resources for many subject areas that are not part of NCLB's accountability standards.&lt;ref&gt;Beveridge, T. (2010). No Child Left Behind and Fine Arts Classes. Arts Education Policy Review, 111(1), 4–7. {{doi|10.1080/10632910903228090}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2007, almost 71% of schools have reduced instruction time in subjects such as history, arts, language, and music to provide more time and resources to mathematics and English.&lt;ref&gt;Grey, A. (2010). No Child Left Behind in Art Education Policy: A Review of Key Recommendations for Arts Language Revisions. Arts Education Policy Review, 111(1), 8–15. {{doi|10.1080/10632910903228132}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pederson, P. (2007).

In some schools, the classes remain available, but individual students who are not proficient in basic skills are sent to [[remedial education|remedial]] reading or mathematics classes rather than arts, sports, or other optional subjects.

According to Paul Reville, the author of "Stop Narrowing of the Curriculum By Right-Sizing School Time," teachers are learning that students need more time to excel in the "needed" subjects. The students need more time to achieve the basic goals that should come by somewhat relevant to a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reville|first=Paul|title=Stop the Narrowing of the Curriculum By ‘Right-Sizing’ School Time|journal=Education Week 24|date=October 2007|issue=Academic Search Premier. EBSCO.Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physical Education]], on the other hand, is one of the subjects least affected.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Jennings and Diane Stark Rentner, Ten Big Effects of the No Child Left Behind Act on Public Schools,  Phi Delta Kappan, Vol. 88, No. 02, October 2006, pp. 110–13&lt;/ref&gt; Some might find this confusing because like many electives and non-core classes, No Child Left Behind does not address Physical Education directly.&lt;ref&gt;Kathy Speregen, "Physical Education in America's Public Schools" UMich.edu&lt;/ref&gt; Two reasons why Physical Education is not adversely affected include the obesity crisis in the United States that the federal government is trying to reverse through programs like First Lady Michelle Obama's ''Let's Move Campaign,'' which among other things, looks to improve the quantity and quality of physical education.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Williams1, Mark B. McClellan and Alice M. Rivlin, "Beyond The Affordable Care Act: Achieving Real Improvements In Americans’ Health" Health Affairs August 2010 29: 81481–88&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, there is research, including a 2005 study by Dr. Charles H. Hillmam of The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that concludes that fitness is globally related to academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman et al. 2005; CDE, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The opportunities, challenges, and risks that No Child Left Behind poses for science education in elementary and middle schools—worldwide competition insists on rapidly improving science education. Adding science assessments to the NCLB requirements may ultimately result in science being taught in more elementary schools and by more teachers than ever before. 2/3 of elementary school teachers indicated that they were not familiar with national science standards. Most concern circulates around the result that, consuming too much time for language arts and mathematics may limit children's experience—and curiosity and interest—in sciences.&lt;ref name="The University of Chicago Press"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marx|first=Ronald W.|author2=Christopher J. Harris |title=No Child Left Behind and Science Education: Opportunities, Challenges, and Risks|journal=The Elementary School Journal|volume=106|date= May 2006 |issue=5|pages=467–78|jstor=10.1086/505441|doi=10.1086/505441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations on local control===
Both U.S. [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[American liberalism|liberal]] critics have argued that NCLB's new standards in federalizing education set a negative precedent for further erosion of [[States' rights|state]] and local control. [[Libertarianism|Libertarians]] further argue that the federal government has no [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] authority in education, which is why participation in NCLB is technically optional. They believe that states need not comply with NCLB so long as they forgo the federal funding that comes with it.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, R.

Retrieved June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on school and students==

===Gifted students===
NCLB pressures schools to guarantee that nearly all students meet the minimum skill levels (set by each state) in reading, writing, and arithmetic—but requires nothing beyond these minima. It provides no incentives to improve student achievement beyond the bare minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html|title=No Child Left Behind Overview: Definitions, Requirements, Criticisms, and More|last=Klein|first=Alyson|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs not essential for achieving mandated minimum skills are neglected or canceled by those districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education-k-12/news/2013/04/08/59542/5-ways-no-child-left-behind-waivers-help-state-education-reform/|title=5 Ways No Child Left Behind Waivers Help State Education Reform  - Center for American Progress|date=2013-04-08|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, NCLB does not require any programs for gifted, talented, and other high-performing students.&lt;ref name=Cloud&gt;Cloud, John. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1653653-1,00.html Are We Failing Our Geniuses?] from Time, July 27, 2007, pp 40–46. Retrieved April 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Federal funding of [[gifted education]] decreased by a third over the law's first five years.&lt;ref name=Cloud /&gt; There was only one program that helped improve the gifted: they received $9.6 million. In the 2007 budget, President George W. Bush zeroed this out.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Charles|year=2007|title=Education, Intelligence, and America’s Future|url=http://www.ciaonet.org/catalog/5667|journal=Columbia International Affairs Online|volume=|pages=5|via=CIAO}}&lt;/ref&gt; While NCLB is silent on the education of academically gifted students, some states (such as [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Virginia]], and [[Pennsylvania]]) require schools to identify gifted students and provide them with an appropriate education, including grade advancement. Research tells us an IQ of 120 is needed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In other states, such as [[Michigan]], state funding for gifted and talented programs was cut by up to 90% in the year after the Act became law.&lt;ref name=Cloud /&gt;

===Unrealistic goals===
"There's a fallacy in the law and everybody knows it," said Alabama State Superintendent Joe Morton on Wednesday, August 11, 2010. According to the No Child Left Behind Act, by 2014, every child is supposed to test on grade level in reading and math. "That can't happen," said Morton. "You have too many variables and you have too many scenarios, and everybody knows that would never happen." Alabama State Board Member Mary Jane Caylor said, "I don't think that No Child Left Behind has benefited this state." She argued the goal of 100 percent proficiency is unattainable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.al.com/breaking/2010/08/times_watchdog_report_no_child.html Times Watchdog Report: No Child Left Behind on the way out, but not anytime soon].

===Gaming the system===
{{See also|Gaming the system}}
The system of incentives and penalties sets up a strong motivation for schools, districts, and states to manipulate test results. For example, schools have been shown to employ "creative reclassification" of [[high school dropouts]] (to reduce unfavorable statistics).&lt;ref&gt;(2004) [http://www.factcheck.org/article181.html Bush Education Ad: Going Positive, Selectively] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107021306/http://www.factcheck.org/article181.html |date=2008-01-07 }}. FactCheck.org. Retrieved June 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at [[Sharpstown High School]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], more than 1,000 students began high school as freshmen, and four years later, fewer than 300 students were enrolled in the senior class.  However, none of these "missing" students from Sharpstown High were reported as dropouts.&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meier and Woods|first=D. and G.|year=2004|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=0-8070-0459-6|page=36|title = Many Children Left Behind: How the No Child Left Behind Act Is Damaging Our Children and Our Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variability in student potential and 100% compliance===
The act is promoted as requiring 100% of students (including disadvantaged and [[special education]] students) within a school to reach the same state standards in reading and mathematics by 2014; detractors charge that a 100% goal is unattainable, and critics of the NCLB requirement for "one high, challenging standard" claim that some students are simply unable to perform at the given level for their age, no matter how effective the teacher is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edaccountability.org/ EdAccountability.org] website.&lt;/ref&gt; While statewide standards reduce the [[educational inequality]] between privileged and underprivileged districts in a state, they still impose a "one size fits all" standard on individual students. Particularly in states with high standards, schools can be punished for not being able to dramatically raise the achievement of students that may have below-average capabilities{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

In fact, the "all" in NCLB means only 95% of students, because states must report the assessment scores of 95% of students when calculating [[Adequate Yearly Progress]] (AYP) scores.&lt;ref name="Wrightslaw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrightslaw.com/heath/nclb.support.htm |title=Doing Your Homework: Answering Questions about Support for NCLB by Sue Heath – Wrightslaw |accessdate=2008-03-06 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students who have an [[Individualized Education Program|Individual Education Plan]] (IEP) and who are assessed must receive the accommodations specified in the IEP during assessment; if these accommodations do not change the nature of the [[Educational assessment|assessment]], then these students' scores are counted the same as any other student's score.  Common acceptable changes include extended test time, testing in a quieter room, translation of math problems into the student's native language, or allowing a student to type answers instead of writing them by hand.

Simply being classified as having [[special education]] needs does not automatically exempt students from assessment.  Most students with mild disabilities or physical disabilities take the same test as non-disabled students.

In addition to not requiring 5% of students to be assessed at all, regulations let schools use alternate assessments to declare up to 1% of all students proficient for the purposes of the Act.&lt;ref name="titleVDOE :: No Child Left Behind – NCLB, Understanding AYP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/src/vps-accountability.shtml |title=VDOE :: No Child Left Behind – NCLB, Understanding AYP |accessdate=2008-03-06 |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080211145310/http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/src/vps-accountability.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  States are given broad discretion in selecting alternate assessments.  For example, a school may accept an [[Advanced Placement]] test for English in lieu of the English test written by the state, and simplified tests for students with significant cognitive disabilities.  The Virginia Alternate Assessment Program (VAAP) and Virginia Grade Level Alternative (VGLA) options, for example, are [[portfolio assessment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doe.virginia.gov/VDOE/srv/terminology.shtml "Terminology" Virginia Department of Education website]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations that support NCLB assessment of disabled or limited English proficient (LEP) students say that [[inclusion (education)|inclusion]] ensures that deficiencies in the education of these disadvantaged students are identified and addressed.  Opponents say that testing students with disabilities violates the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) by making students with disabilities learn the same material as non-disabled students.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, Liz.

===Children with disabilities===
NCLB includes incentives to reward schools showing progress for students with disabilities and other measures to fix or provide students with alternative options than schools not meeting the needs of the disabled population.&lt;ref&gt;[[No Child Left Behind Act#Provisions of the act]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The law is written so that the scores of students with IEPs (Individualized Education Plans) and 504 plans are counted just as other students' scores are counted.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Schools have argued against having disabled populations involved in their AYP measurements because they claim that there are too many variables involved.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===Aligning the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act===
Stemming from the [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act]] (EAHCA) of 1975, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) was enacted in its first form in 1997, and then reenacted with new education aspects in 2006 (although still referred to as [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA 2004]]). It kept the EAHCA requirements of free and accessible education for all children.  The 2004 IDEA authorized formula grants to states and discretionary grants for research, technology, and training.  It also required schools to use research-based interventions to assist students with disabilities.

The amount of funding each school would receive from its "Local Education Agency" for each year would be divided by the number of children with disabilities and multiplied by the number of students with disabilities participating in the schoolwide programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cdynamic%2CTopicalBrief%2C11%2C |title=Building The Legacy of IDEA 2004 |publisher=Idea.ed.gov |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act#Alignment with No Child Left Behind]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly since 2004, policymakers have sought to align IDEA with NCLB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/policy/speced/guid/idea/tb-nclb-align.pdf|title=Reauthorized Statute Alignment With the No Child Left Behind Act|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=IDEA|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious points of alignment include the shared requirements for [[Highly Qualified Teachers]], for establishment of goals for students with special needs,  and for assessment levels for these students. In 2004, George Bush signed provisions that would define for both of these acts what was considered a "highly qualified teacher."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cdynamic%2CTopicalBrief%2C3%2C |title=Building The Legacy of IDEA 2004 |publisher=Idea.ed.gov |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive effects for students with disabilities===
The [[National Council on Disability]] (NCD) looks at how NCLB and IDEA are improving outcomes for students with Down syndrome.  The effects they investigate include reducing the number of students who drop out, increasing graduation rates, and effective strategies to transition students to post-secondary education.  Their studies have reported that NCLB and IDEA have changed the attitudes and expectations for students with disabilities. They are pleased that students are finally included in state assessment and accountability systems. NCLB made assessments be taken "seriously," they found, as now assessments and accommodations are under review by administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.aypf.org/publications/NCLB-Disabilities.pdf|title=No Child Left Behind: Improving Educational Outcomes for Students with Disabilities|last=American Youth Policy Forum|first=|last2=Educational Policy Institute|publisher=National Council on Disability|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=7–8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another organization that found positive correlations between NCLB and IDEA was the National Center on Educational Outcomes.  It published a brochure for parents of students with disabilities about how the two (NCLB &amp; IDEA) work well together because they "provide both individualized instruction and school accountability for students and disabilities."  They specifically highlight the new focus on "shared responsibility of general and special education teachers," forcing schools to have disabled students more on their radar." They do acknowledge, however, that for each student to "participate in the general curriculum [of high standards for all students] and make progress toward proficiency," additional time and effort for coordination are needed.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 10–12, http://www.cehd.umn.edu/nceo/onlinepubs/parents.pdf, "NCLB and IDEA: What parents need to know and do"&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Center on Educational Outcomes reported that now disabled students will receive "...the academic attention and resources they deserved."&lt;ref&gt;p. 20, http://www.cehd.umn.edu/nceo/onlinepubs/parents.pdf, "NCLB and IDEA: What parents need to know and do"&lt;/ref&gt;

Particular research has been done on how the laws impact students who are [[deaf]] or hard of hearing. First, the legislation makes schools responsible for how students with disabilities score—emphasizing "...student outcomes instead of placement."&lt;ref&gt;pp. 480–81, "Policies for Students Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing Hidden Benefits and Unintended Consequences of No Child Left Behind," http://aer.sagepub.com/content/44/3/460.full.pdf+html&lt;/ref&gt;  It also puts the public’s eye on how outside programs can be utilized to improve outcomes for this underserved population, and has thus prompted more research on the effectiveness of certain in- and out-of-school interventions.  For example, NCLB requirements have made researchers begin to study the effects of read aloud or interpreters on both reading and mathematics assessments, and on having students sign responses that are then recorded by a scribe.

Still, research thus far on the positive effects of NCLB/IDEA is limited.  It has been aimed at young students in an attempt to find strategies to help them learn to read.  Evaluations also have included a limited number of students, which make it very difficult to draw conclusions to a broader group.  Evaluations also focus only on one type of disabilities.

===Negative effects for students with disabilities===
The National Council for Disabilities had reservations about how the regulations of NCLB fit with those of IDEA.  One concern is how schools can effectively intervene and develop strategies when NCLB calls for group accountability rather than individual student attention.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, "No Child Left Behind:Improving Educational Outcomes for Students with Disabilities" http://www.aypf.org/publications/NCLB-Disabilities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Individual nature of IDEA is "inconsistent with the group nature of NCLB."&lt;ref&gt;p. 23, "No Child Left Behind:Improving Educational Outcomes for Students with Disabilities" http://www.aypf.org/publications/NCLB-Disabilities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They worry that NCLB focuses too much on standardized testing and not enough on the work-based experience necessary for obtaining jobs in the future.  Also, NCLB is measured essentially by a single test score, but IDEA calls for various measures of student success.

IDEA's focus on various measures stems from its foundation in Individualized Education Plans for students with disabilities (IEP). An IEP is designed to give students with disabilities individual goals that are often not on their grade level. An IEP is intended for "developing goals and objectives that correspond to the needs of the student, and ultimately choosing a placement in the least restrictive environment possible for the student."&lt;ref&gt;[[Individualized Education Program]]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the IEP, students could be able to legally have lowered success criteria for academic success.

A 2006 report by the Center for Evaluation and Education Policy (CEEP) and the Indiana Institute on Disability and Community indicated that most states were not making AYP because of special education subgroups even though progress had been made toward that end.  This was in effect pushing schools to cancel the inclusion model and keep special education students separate. "IDEA calls for individualized curriculum and assessments that determine success based on growth and improvement each year. NCLB, in contrast, measures all students by the same markers, which are based not on individual improvement but by proficiency in math and reading," the study states.&lt;ref&gt;Education Policy Brief, Closing the Achievement Gap Series: Part III, "What is the Impact of NCLB on the Inclusion of Students with Disabilities?"
Cassandra Cole, http://www.ceep.indiana.edu/projects/PDF/PB_V4N11_Fall_2006_NCLB_dis.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425124129/http://www.ceep.indiana.edu/projects/PDF/PB_V4N11_Fall_2006_NCLB_dis.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When interviewed with the Indiana University Newsroom, author of the CEEP report Sandi Cole said, "The system needs to make sense. Don't we want to know how much a child is progressing towards the standards?...We need a system that values learning and growth over time, in addition to helping students reach high standards."&lt;ref&gt;Cassandro Cole, Interview w/ Newsroom Indiana University, http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/4379.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Cole found in her survey that NCLB encourages teachers to teach to the test, limiting curriculum choices/options, and to use the special education students as a "scapegoat" for their school not making AYP.  In addition, Indiana administrators who responded to the survey indicated that NCLB testing has led to higher numbers of students with disabilities dropping out of school.

Legal journals have also commented on the incompatibility of IDEA and NCLB; some say the acts may never be reconciled with one another.&lt;ref&gt;The Impact of No Child Left Behind on IDEA’s Guarantee of Free, Appropriate Public Education for Students with Disabilities: A Critical Review of Recent Case Law, http://www.luc.edu/law/academics/special/center/child/childed_forum/pdfs/2009_student_papers/kraus_impact_no_child.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130163302/http://www.luc.edu/law/academics/special/center/child/childed_forum/pdfs/2009_student_papers/kraus_impact_no_child.pdf |date=2012-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that an IEP is designed specifically for individual student achievement, which gives the rights to parents to ensure that the schools are following the necessary protocols of Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE). They worry that not enough emphasis is being placed on the child's IEP with this setup. In Board of Education for Ottawa Township High School District 140 v. Spelling, two Illinois school districts and parents of disabled students challenged the legality of NCLB’s testing requirements in light of IDEA’s mandate to provide students with individualized education.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, The Impact of No Child Left Behind on IDEA’s Guarantee of Free, Appropriate Public Education for Students with Disabilities: A Critical Review of Recent Case Law, http://www.luc.edu/law/academics/special/center/child/childed_forum/pdfs/2009_student_papers/kraus_impact_no_child.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130163302/http://www.luc.edu/law/academics/special/center/child/childed_forum/pdfs/2009_student_papers/kraus_impact_no_child.pdf |date=2012-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although students there were aligned with "proficiency" to state standards, students did not meet requirements of their IEP.  Their parents feared that students were not given right to FAPE.  The case questioned which better indicated progress: standardized test measures, or IEP measures?  It concluded that since some students may never test on grade level, all students with disabilities should be given more options and accommodations with standardized testing than they currently receive.

==Effects on racial and ethnic minority students==

===Attention to minority populations===
* Seeks to narrow the class and [[racial achievement gap in the United States]] by creating common expectations for all. NCLB has shown mixed success in eliminating the racial achievement gap. Although test scores are improving, they are not improving equally for all races, which means that minority students are still behind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* Requires schools and districts to focus their attention on the academic achievement of traditionally under-served groups of children, such as low-income students, students with disabilities, and students of "major racial and ethnic subgroups".&lt;ref name="titleCharting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2004/01/01142004.html#elements |title=Charting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind |accessdate=2008-04-09 |publisher=U.S. Department of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each state is responsible for defining major racial and ethnic subgroups itself.&lt;ref name="titleCharting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind"/&gt;  Many previous state-created systems of accountability measured only average school performance—so schools could be highly rated even if they had large achievement gaps between affluent and disadvantaged students.

===State refusal to produce non-English assessments===
All students who are learning English would have an automatic three-year window to take assessments in their native language, after which they must normally demonstrate proficiency on an English-language assessment. However, the local education authority may grant an exception to any individual English learner for another two years' testing in his or her native language on a case-by-case basis.

In practice, however, only 10 states choose to test any English language learners in their native language (almost entirely Spanish speakers).&lt;!-- dead ref: http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2006/03/01/25ell.h25.html --&gt; The vast majority of English language learners are given English language assessments.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, J.

Many schools test or assess students with limited English proficiency even when the students are exempt from NCLB-mandated reporting, because the tests may provide useful information to the teacher and school.  In certain schools with large immigrant populations, this exemption comprises a majority of young students.

NCLB testing under-reports learning at non-English-language immersion schools, particularly those that immerse students in Native American languages.  NCLB requires some Native American students to take standardized tests in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/native-american-languages-act-twenty-years-later-has-it-made-difference |title=Native American Languages Act: Twenty Years Later, Has It Made a Difference? |publisher=Cultural Survival |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases, the students could be legally tested in their native language, except that the state has not paid to have the test translated.

===Demographic study of AYP failure rates and requirement for failing schools===
One study found that schools in California and Illinois that have not met AYP serve 75–85% minority students while schools meeting AYP have less than 40% minority students.&lt;ref&gt;Owens, A., &amp; Sunderman, G. L. (2006). ''School Accountability under NCLB: Aid or Obstacle for Measuring Racial Equity?'' Cambridge, MA: Civil Rights Project at Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools that do not meet AYP are required to offer their students' parents the opportunity to transfer their students to a non-failing school within the district, but it is not required that the other school accepts the student.&lt;ref name="Knaus, Christopher 2007"&gt;Knaus, Christopher. (2007). [http://www.berkeleyrep.org/school/images/Knaus.pdf ''Still Segregated Still Unequal: Analyzing the Impact of No Child Left Behind on African American Students'']. University of California, Berkeley: National Urban League.&lt;/ref&gt; NCLB controls the portion of federal Title I funding based upon each school meeting annual set standards.  Any participating school that does not make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for two years must offer parents the choice to send their child to a non-failing school in the district, and after three years, must provide supplemental services, such as free tutoring or after-school assistance. After five years of not meeting AYP, the school must make dramatic changes to how the school is run, which could entail state-takeover.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education: The Condition of Education 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
As part of their support for NCLB, the administration and Congress backed massive increases in funding for elementary and secondary education.  Total federal education funding increased from $42.2 billion to $55.7 billion from 2001, the fiscal year before the law's passage, to fiscal year 2004.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"&gt;U.S. Department of Education, Fiscal Year 2009 Budget Proposal [http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget09/summary/edlite-section1.html].&lt;/ref&gt; A new $1 billion Reading First program was created, distributing funds to local schools to improve the teaching of reading, and over $100 million for its companion, Early Reading First.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget05/summary/edlite-section1.html U.S. Department of Education, Fiscal Year 2005 Budget Proposal]&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other formula programs received large increases as well.  This was consistent with the administration's position of funding formula programs, which distribute money to local schools for their use, and grant programs, where particular schools or groups apply directly to the federal government for funding. In total, federal funding for education increased 59.8% from 2000 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ed.gov/nclb/overview/intro/index.htm |title=Archived:Introduction: No Child Left Behind |publisher=US Department of Education |accessdate=2009-02-23 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The act created a new competitive-grant program called Reading First, funded at $1.02 billion in 2004, to help states and districts set up "scientific, research-based" reading programs for children in grades K–3 (with priority given to high-poverty areas). A smaller early-reading program sought to help states better prepare 3- to 5-year-olds in disadvantaged areas to read. The program's funding was later cut drastically by Congress amid budget talks.&lt;ref name="edweek.org"&gt;{{cite web|title = No Child Left Behind: An Overview|url = http://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html|publisher = Education Week|accessdate = 29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding Changes: Through an alteration in the Title I funding formula, the No Child Left Behind Act was expected to better target resources to school districts with high concentrations of poor children. The law also included provisions intended to give states and districts greater flexibility in how they spent a portion of their federal allotments.&lt;ref name="edweek.org"/&gt;

Funding for school technology used in classrooms as part of NCLB is administered by the Enhancing Education Through Technology Program (EETT). Funding sources are used for equipment, professional development and training for educators, and updated research.  EETT allocates funds by formula to states. The states, in turn, reallocate 50% of the funds to local districts by Title I formula and 50% competitively. While districts must reserve a minimum of 25% of all EETT funds for professional development, recent studies indicate that most EETT recipients use far more than 25% of their EETT funds to train teachers to use technology and integrate it into their curricula. In fact, EETT recipients committed more than $159 million in EETT funds towards professional development during the 2004–05 school year alone.  Moreover, even though EETT recipients are afforded broad discretion in their use of EETT funds, surveys show that they target EETT dollars towards improving student achievement in reading and mathematics, engaging in data-driven decision making, and launching online assessment programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In addition, the provisions of NCLB permitted increased flexibility for state and local agencies in the use of federal education money.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCLB increases were companions to another massive increase in federal education funding at that time.  The Bush administration and congress passed very large increases in funding for the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) at the same time as the NCLB increases.  IDEA Part B, a state formula-funding program that distributes money to local districts for the education of students with disabilities, was increased from $6.3 billion in 2001 to $10.1 billion in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget07/summary/edlite-section1.html U.S. Department of Education, Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Proposal]&lt;/ref&gt; Because a district's and state's performance on NCLB measures depended on improved performance by students with disabilities, particularly, students with learning disabilities, this 60 percent increase in funding was also an important part of the overall approach to NCLB implementation.

===Criticisms of funding levels===
Some critics claim that extra expenses are not fully reimbursed by increased levels of federal NCLB funding. Others note that funding for the law increased massively following passage&lt;ref name="Education 2006"&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/fed/10facts/edlite-chart.html#5 U.S. Department of Education, Elementary and Secondary Education Act Budget Table]. 2006. 7 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and that billions in funds previously allocated to particular uses could be reallocated to new uses.  Even before the law's passage, Secretary of Education Rod Paige noted ensuring that children are educated remained a state responsibility regardless of federal support:
{{quote|Washington is willing to help [with the additional costs of federal requirements], as we've helped before, even before we [proposed NCLB]. But this is a part of the teaching responsibility that each state has. ... Washington has offered some assistance now. In the legislation, we have ... some support to pay for the development of tests. But even if that should be looked at as a gift, it is the state responsibility to do this.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/schools/interviews/paige.html|title= Frontline. Testing Our Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Various early Democratic supporters of NCLB criticize its implementation, claiming it is not adequately funded by either the federal government or the states. [[Ted Kennedy]], the legislation's initial sponsor, once stated: "The tragedy is that these long overdue reforms are finally in place, but the funds are not."&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.amconmag.com/2005_08_01/article.html Leaving No Child Left Behind: States charged with implementing Bush’s national education plan balk at the cost of compliance.] ''The American Conservative.'' Retrieved 6/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan B. Neuman]], U.S. Department of Education's former Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education, commented about her worries of NCLB in a meeting of the [[International Reading Association]]:
{{quote|In [the most disadvantaged schools] in America, even the most earnest teacher has often given up because they lack every available resource that could possibly make a difference. ... When we say all children can achieve and then not give them the additional resources ... we are creating a fantasy.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/article181.html|title=Bush Education Ad: Going Positive, Selectively|publisher=[[FactCheck]]|year=2004|accessdate=2007-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107021306/http://www.factcheck.org/article181.html|archive-date=2008-01-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Organizations have particularly criticized the unwillingness of the federal government to "fully fund" the act. Noting that [[United States House of Representatives#Legislative functions|appropriations bills always originate in the House of Representatives]], it is true that during the Bush Administration, neither the Senate nor the White House has even requested federal funding up to the authorized levels for several of the act’s main provisions. For example, [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] requested only $13.3 billion of a possible $22.75 billion in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.aft.org/topics/nclb/funding.htm Funding] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019125537/http://www.aft.org/topics/nclb/funding.htm |date=2006-10-19 }}. American Federation of Teachers. Retrieved 6/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advocacy groups note that President Bush's 2008 budget proposal allotted $61 billion for the Education Department, cutting funding by $1.3 billion from the year before. 44 out of 50 states would have received reductions in federal funding if the budget passed as it was.&lt;ref&gt;Center for American Progress [http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/10/education_map.html The Targets of Bush's Education Cuts].&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, funding for the Enhancing Education Through Technology Program (EETT) has continued to drop while the demand for technology in schools has increased (Technology and Learning, 2006). However, these claims focused on reallocated funds, as each of President Bush's proposed budgets increased funding for major NCLB formula programs such as [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act|Title I]], including his final 2009 budget proposal.&lt;ref name="ed.gov"/&gt;

Members of Congress have viewed these authorized levels as spending caps, not spending promises. Some opponents argue that these funding shortfalls mean that schools faced with the system of escalating penalties for failing to meet testing targets are denied the resources necessary to remedy problems detected by testing. However, federal NCLB formula funding increased by billions during this period&lt;ref name="Education 2006"/&gt; and state and local funding increased by over $100 billion from school year 2001–02 through 2006–07.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d07/tables/dt07_026.asp?referrer=list National Center for Education Statistics, Digest of Education Statistics 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In fiscal year 2007, $75 billion in costs were shifted from NCLB, adding further stresses on state budgets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/StateFederalCommittees/BudgetsRevenue/MandateMonitorOverview/tabid/15850/Default.aspx:Mandate Monitor Overview]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This decrease resulted in schools cutting programs that served to educate children, which subsequently impacted the ability to meet the goals of NCLB. The decrease in funding came at a time when there was an increase in expectations for school performance. To make ends meet, many schools re-allocated funds that had been intended for other purposes (e.g., arts, sports, etc.)  to achieve the national educational goals set by NCLB. Congress acknowledged these funding decreases and retroactively provided the funds to cover shortfalls, but without the guarantee of permanent aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13746166 |title=Funding Stagnant for No Child Left Behind Program |publisher=NPR |date=2007-08-20 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number one area where funding was cut from the national budget was in Title I funding for disadvantaged students and schools.&lt;ref name="cgcs.org"&gt;[http://www.cgcs.org/images/Legislative/Feb06.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120172356/http://www.cgcs.org/images/Legislative/Feb06.pdf|date=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

===State education budgets===
According to the book ''NCLB Meets School Realities'', the act was put into action during a time of fiscal crisis for most states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The funding they received from the federal government in support of NCLB was not enough to cover the added expense necessary to adhere to the new law.

==Proposals for reform==
The Joint Organizational Statement on No Child Left Behind&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtest.org/joint%20statement%20civil%20rights%20grps%2010-21-04.html|title= Joint Organizational Statement on No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act|date=2004-10-21|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a proposal by more than 135 national civil rights, education, disability advocacy, civic, labor, and religious groups that have signed on to a statement calling for major changes to the federal education law. The National Center for Fair &amp; Open Testing (FairTest) initiated and chaired the meetings that produced the statement, originally released in October 2004. The statement's central message is that "the law's emphasis needs to shift from applying sanctions for failing to raise test scores to holding states and localities accountable for making the systemic changes that improve student achievement." The number of organizations signing the statement has nearly quadrupled since it was launched in late 2004 and continues to grow. The goal is to influence Congress, and the broader public, as the law's scheduled reauthorization approaches.

Education critic [[Alfie Kohn]] argues that the NCLB law is "unredeemable" and should be scrapped. He is quoted saying "[I]ts main effect has been to sentence poor children to an endless regimen of test-preparation drills".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/05/31/1558/ NCLB: 'Too Destructive to Salvage'], ''USA Today'', May 31, 2007. Retrieved 6/7/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, former [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services Secretary]] [[Tommy Thompson]] and [[Georgia Governor]] [[Roy Barnes]], Co-Chairs of the Aspen Commission on No Child Left Behind, announced the release of the Commission's final recommendations for the reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspeninstitute.org/site/c.huLWJeMRKpH/b.938015/k.40DA/Commission_on_No_Child_Left_Behind.htm Beyond NCLB: Fulfilling the Promise to Our Nation's Children] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608121158/http://www.aspeninstitute.org/site/c.huLWJeMRKpH/b.938015/k.40DA/Commission_on_No_Child_Left_Behind.htm |date=2007-06-08 }}, February, 2007. Retrieved 6/8/07.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Commission is an independent, bipartisan effort to improve NCLB and ensure it is a more useful force in closing the achievement gap that separates disadvantaged children and their peers.  After a year of hearings, analysis, and research, the Commission uncovered the successes of NCLB, as well as provisions that must be significantly changed.

The Commission's goals are:
* Have effective teachers for all students, effective principals for all communities
* Accelerate progress and achievement gaps closed through improved accountability
* Move beyond status quo to effective school improvement and student options
* Have fair and accurate assessments of student progress
* Have high standards for every student in every state
* Ensure high schools prepare students for college and the workplace
* Drive progress through reliable, accurate data
* Encourage parental involvement and empowerment

The Forum on Educational Accountability (FEA), a working group of signers of the Joint Organizational Statement on NCLB has offered an alternative proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edaccountability.org/|title=Forum on Educational Accountability|accessdate=2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposes to shift NCLB from applying sanctions for failing to raise test scores to supporting state and communities and holding them accountable as they make systemic changes that improve student learning.

While many critics and policymakers believe the NCLB legislation has major flaws, it appears the policy will be in effect for the long-term, though not without major modifications.

President Barack Obama released a blueprint for reform of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]], the successor to No Child Left Behind, in March 2010. Specific revisions include providing funds for states to implement a broader range of assessments to evaluate advanced academic skills, including students’ abilities to conduct research, use technology, engage in scientific investigation, solve problems, and communicate effectively.

In addition, Obama proposes that the NCLB legislation lessen its stringent accountability punishments to states by focusing more on student improvement. Improvement measures would encompass assessing all children appropriately, including English language learners, minorities, and special needs students. The school system would be re-designed to consider measures beyond reading and math tests; and would promote incentives to keep students enrolled in school through graduation, rather than encouraging student drop-out to increase AYP scores.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, A. [http://www.education.com/magazine/article/Obama_Child_Left_Behind/ "Obama on No Child Left Behind Act"], "Education.com, Inc." (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama’s objectives also entail lowering the achievement gap between Black and White students and also increasing the federal budget by $3 billion to help schools meet the strict mandates of the bill. There has also been a proposal, put forward by the Obama administration, that states increase their academic standards after a [[dumbing down]] period, focus on re-classifying schools that have been labeled as failing, and develop a new evaluation process for teachers and educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/no_child_left_behind_act/index.html?scp=1&amp;sq=NCLB&amp;st=cse| title=No Child Left Behind Act | work=The New York Times | first=Sam | last=Dillon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government’s gradual investment in public social provisions provides the NCLB Act a forum to deliver on its promise to improve achievement for all of its students. Education critics argue that although the legislation is marked as an improvement to the ESEA in de-segregating the quality of education in schools, it is actually harmful. The legislation has become virtually the only federal social policy meant to address wide-scale social inequities, and its policy features inevitably stigmatize both schools attended by children of the poor and children in general.

Moreover, critics further argue that the current political landscape of this country, which favors market-based solutions to social and economic problems, has eroded trust in public institutions and has undermined political support for an expansive concept of social responsibility, which subsequently results in a disinvestment in the education of the poor and privatization of American schools.

Skeptics posit that NCLB provides distinct political advantages to Democrats, whose focus on accountability offers a way for them to speak of equal opportunity and avoid being classified as the party of big government, special interests, and minority groups—a common accusation from Republicans who want to discredit what they see as the traditional Democratic agenda. Opponents posit that NCLB has inadvertently shifted the debate on education and racial inequality to traditional political alliances. Consequently, major political discord remains between those who oppose federal oversight of state and local practices and those who view NCLB in terms of civil rights and educational equality.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, R. and Kantor, H. (2006). From New Deal to No Deal: No Child Left Behind Act and the Devolution of Responsibility for Equal Opportunity. 76:4. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard Educational Review.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the plan, the Obama Administration responds to critiques that standardized testing fails to capture higher level thinking by outlining new systems of evaluation to capture more in depth assessments on student achievement.&lt;ref name="ESEA Blueprint for Reform"&gt;U.S. Department of Education [http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/blueprint/blueprint.pdf "ESEA Blueprint for Reform"], (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; His plan came on the heels of the announcement of the [[Race to the Top]] initiative, a $4.35 billion reform program financed by the Department of Education through the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;Lohman, J. [http://www.cga.ct.gov/2010/rpt/2010-R-0235.htm "Comparing No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top."], "OLR Research Report" (4 June 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama says that accurate assessments "...can be used to accurately measure student growth; to better measure how states, districts, schools, principals, and teachers are educating students; to help teachers adjust and focus their teaching, and to provide better information to students and their families."&lt;ref name="ESEA Blueprint for Reform"/&gt; He has pledged to support state governments in their efforts to improve [[standardized test]] provisions by upgrading the standards they are set to measure. To do this, the federal government gives states grants to help develop and implement assessments based on higher standards so they can more accurately measure school progress.&lt;ref name="ESEA Blueprint for Reform"/&gt; This mirrors provisions in the Race to the Top program that require states to measure individual achievement through sophisticated data collection from kindergarten to higher education.

While Obama plans to improve the quality of standardized testing, he does not plan to eliminate the testing requirements and accountability measures produced by standardized tests. Rather, he provides additional resources and flexibility to meet new goals.&lt;ref&gt;Russell Chaddock, G. [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0315/Obama-s-No-Child-Left-Behind-revise-a-little-more-flexibility "Obama’s No Child Left Behind Revise: A Little More Flexibility"], "The Christian Science Monitor". (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Obama’s reform efforts maintain that high-stakes testing is detrimental to school success across the country, because it encourages teachers to "teach to the test" and places undue pressure on teachers and schools if they fail to meet benchmarks.&lt;ref&gt;Ravitch, D. [http://0-www.eric.ed.gov.novacat.nova.edu/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ919558&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ919558 "Dictating to the Schools: A Look at the Effects of the Bush and Obama Administrations on Schools"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810123430/http://0-www.eric.ed.gov.novacat.nova.edu/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ919558&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ919558 |date=2011-08-10 }}, "Virginia Journal of Education".

The re-authorization process has become somewhat of a controversy, as lawmakers and politicians continually debate about the changes that must be made to the bill to make it work best for the educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairtest.org/NCLB-lost-decade-report-home |title=NCLB’s Lost Decade Report |publisher=FairTest |date=2011-12-30 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waivers ==
In 2012, President Obama granted waivers from NCLB requirements to several states. "In exchange for that flexibility, those states 'have agreed to raise standards, improve accountability, and undertake essential reforms to improve teacher effectiveness,' the White House said in a statement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-09/politics/politics_states-education_1_waivers-flexibility-standards?_s=PM:POLITICS | work=CNN | title=Obama to push 'No Child Left Behind' overhaul | date=March 15, 2010 | access-date=February 13, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214144437/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-02-09/politics/politics_states-education_1_waivers-flexibility-standards?_s=PM:POLITICS | archive-date=February 14, 2012 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The waivers of [[Arizona]], [[Oregon]], and [[Kansas]] are conditional, according to Acting Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education Michael Yudin. Arizona has not yet received state board approval for teacher evaluations, and Kansas and Oregon are both still developing teacher and principal evaluation guidelines.

In addition, five states that did not complete the waiver process—and one whose application was rejected—got a one-year freeze on the rising targets for standardized test scores: [[Alabama]], [[Alaska]], [[Idaho]], [[Iowa]], [[Maine]], and [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=07/19/2012 12:01 am Updated: 08/13/2012 11:04 am |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/19/no-child-left-behind-waiver_n_1684504.html |title=No Child Left Behind Waivers Granted To 33 U.S. States, Some With Strings Attached |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2013-06-24 |date=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 2015, a bill was introduced to Congress to replace the No Child Left Behind Act, the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]], which was passed by the House on December 2 and the Senate on December 9, before being signed into law by President Obama on December 10, 2015.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/1177|title=S.1177 114th Congress (2015–2016): Every Student Succeeds Act|last=Lamar|first=Sen Alexander|date=2015-04-30|website=congress.gov|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill affords states more flexibility in regards to setting their own respective standards for measuring school as well as student performance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/12/2/9836014/every-student-succeeds-act|title=Congress is getting rid of No Child Left Behind.

The '''Ohrid Framework Agreement''' ({{lang-sq|Marrëveshja e Ohrit}}, {{lang-mk|Охридски рамковен договор|Ohridski ramkoven dogovor}}) was the peace deal signed by the government of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] and ethnic [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Albanian]] representatives on 13 August 2001. The agreement ended the [[2001 insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|armed conflict]] between the [[National Liberation Army (Macedonia)|National Liberation Army]] and the Macedonian security forces and set the groundwork for improving the rights of ethnic Albanians.

The Agreement also included provisions for altering the official languages of the country, with any language spoken by over 20% of the population becoming co-official with the [[Macedonian language]] at the [[Municipalities of the Republic of Macedonia|municipal level]]. Currently only the [[Albanian language]], with an approximate 25% of the population fulfils this criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ecmi.de/fileadmin/downloads/publications/JEMIE/2002/nr1/Focus1-2002Brunnbauer.pdf|title=The implementation of the Ohrid Agreement: Ethnic Macedonian resentments|first=Ulf|last=Brunnbauer|journal=Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe|format=PDF|issue=1/2002|year=2002|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the document, the version in English language is the only authentic version of the Ohrid Framework Agreement. The [[Macedonian Government]] had to adapt the [[Constitution of Macedonia]] to give the [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Albanian minority]] living in Macedonia fifteen basic rights. The lead negotiator on the behalf of the [[United States]] in the Ohrid Agreement was [[James W. Pardew]], who had been dispatched by then-[[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Colin Powell]].

{{Competition law}}
The '''Parker immunity doctrine''' is an exemption from [[Legal liability|liability]] for engaging in [[antitrust]] violations.  It applies to the state when it exercises legislative authority in creating a regulation with anticompetitive effects, and to private actors when they act at the direction of the state after it has done so.  The doctrine is named for the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] case in which it was initially developed, ''[[Parker v. Brown]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Parker, Director of Agriculture, et al. v. Brown'', 317 U.S. 341 (1943).&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale behind ''Parker'' immunity is that Congress, in enacting the Sherman Act, evidenced no intent to restrain state behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[Parker v. Brown]] at 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

==State must act as a sovereign==
For the doctrine to apply, the state must act as a sovereign, rather than as a "participant in a private agreement or combination by others for restraint of trade.&lt;ref&gt;''Parker'' at 351-2; see also ''Omni'', 499 U.S. at 374-5 ("Immunity does not necessarily obtain where the state acts not in a regulatory capacity but as a commercial participant in a given market").&lt;/ref&gt; Antitrust laws do not bar anticompetitive restraints that sovereign states impose "as an act of government".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parker v. Brown]]'', 317 U.S. 341, 352 (1943); see also ''[[Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Assoc.]]'', 107 F.3d 1026, 1035 (3d Cir. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; "The key question is whether the allegedly anticompetitive restraint may be considered the product of sovereign state action. If it is not, then even if sectors of state government are involved, the activity will not constitute "state action" under the Parker doctrine and will not receive immunity."&lt;ref name="BedellWholesale"&gt;[[A.D. Bedell Wholesale Co., Inc. v. Philip Morris Inc.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the Parker court found that "a state does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their action is lawful."&lt;ref&gt;Parker, 317 U.S. at 351.&lt;/ref&gt;Instead, the anticompetitive conduct "must be compelled by direction of the State acting as a sovereign," not merely prompted by state action, to be immunized under the state action doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar]]'', {{ussc|421|773|1975|pin=791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special definition of "state action" in Parker immunity cases==
"State action," as defined in cases granting Parker immunity, is qualitatively different from "state action" in other contexts such as the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;See 1 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, supra, at P 221.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Fourteenth Amendment can cover
:inadvertent or unilateral acts of state officials not acting pursuant to state policy . . . the term "state action" in antitrust adjudication refers only to government policies that are articulated with sufficient clarity that it can be said that these are in fact the state's policies, and not simply happenstance, mistakes, or acts reflecting the discretion of individual officials.
Because it is grounded in federalism and respect for state sovereignty, this interest in protecting the acts of the  sovereign state, even if anticompetitive, outweighs the importance of a freely competitive marketplace, especially in the absence of contrary congressional intent.

"State action" as defined by the Parker doctrine differs from the government "actions" which results from petitioning. The two are not coterminous. A finding of immunity from injury caused by government action under the [[Noerr-Pennington doctrine]] does not require a finding of Parker state action.&lt;ref&gt;See 1 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, supra, at P 206 (interpreting our dicta in Massachusetts School of Law, 107 F.3d 1026 (3d Cir. 1997) as noting this distinction).&lt;/ref&gt; If the government "action" taken is the result of petitioning, Noerr-Pennington immunity attaches to a broader range of government action than does Parker immunity. Noerr-Pennington immunity protects petitioning, so long as it is not a sham.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Subscription Television v. S. Cal. Theatre Owners Ass'n]], 576 F.2d 230, 233-34 (9th Cir. 1978) (holding defendants immune from antitrust liability under Noerr-Pennington even though their petitioning led to the passage of an unconstitutional initiative).&lt;/ref&gt; Under Noerr-Pennington immunity, the government actions which flow from valid petitioning need not qualify as Parker "state action." Petitioning "would be considerably chilled by a rule which would require an advocate to predict whether the desired legislation would withstand a constitutional challenge in the courts and to expose itself to a potential treble antitrust action based on that prediction."&lt;ref&gt;Subscription Television, 576 F.2d at 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congress intended the Sherman Act to address business combination, not state combination==
Without clear congressional intent to preempt, federal laws should not invalidate state programs. "In a dual system of government in which, under the Constitution, the states are sovereign, save only as Congress may constitutionally subtract from their authority, an unexpressed purpose to nullify a state's control over its officers and agents is not lightly to be attributed to Congress."&lt;ref&gt;Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 351 (1943).&lt;/ref&gt; While individual anticompetitive acts of state governments may be considered unwise or counterproductive, the decision to make such choices lies within the sovereign power of the states. Congress did not intend to override important state interests in passing the Sherman Act. "The general language of the Sherman Act should not be interpreted to prohibit anticompetitive actions by the States in their governmental capacities as sovereign regulators."&lt;ref&gt;[[City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Adver.]], 499 U.S. 365, 374 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sherman Act was enacted to address the unlawful combination of private businesses.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader]], 310 U.S. 469, 493 n.15 (1940) ("The history of the Sherman Act as contained in the legislative proceedings is emphatic in its support for the conclusion that 'business competition' was the problem considered and that the act was designed to prevent restraints of trade which had a significant effect on such competition.").&lt;/ref&gt; "There is no suggestion of a purpose to restrain state action in the Act's legislative history."&lt;ref&gt;Parker, 63 S. Ct. at 313.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sherman Act was passed "in the era of 'trusts' and of 'combinations' of businesses and of capital organized and directed to control of the market by suppression of competition in the marketing of goods and services, the monopolistic tendency of which had become a matter of public concern."&lt;ref&gt;Apex, 310 U.S. at 493.&lt;/ref&gt; Given its focus on the problems of private monopolies and combinations, it is not surprising that the Sherman Act does not set out to curb clearly defined anticompetitive state actions.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Cal. Retail Liquor Dealers Assoc. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.]], 445 U.S. 97, 104 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

When a state clearly acts in its sovereign capacity it avoids the constraints of the Sherman Act and may act anticompetitively to further other policy goals.&lt;ref&gt;See S. Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, 471 U.S. 48, 54 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, state governments frequently sanction monopolies to ensure consistent provision of essential services like electric power, gas, cable television, or local telephone service. But "a state does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their action is lawful."&lt;ref&gt;Parker, 317 U.S. at 351 (states cannot authorize private parties to set a price and then enforce those prices without any evaluation of their reasonableness).&lt;/ref&gt; Only an affirmative decision by the state itself, acting in its sovereign capacity, and with active supervision, can immunize otherwise anticompetitive activity.

==Midcal's two-part test for whether to treat an action as a "state action"==
Applying ''Midcal'' is unnecessary if the alleged antitrust injury was the direct result of a clear sovereign state act.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover v. Am. Bar Assoc.]], 107 F.3d 1026, 1036 (3d Cir. 1997); [[Sessions Tank Liners, Inc. v. Joor Mfg.]], Inc., 17 F.3d 295, 299 (9th Cir. 1994) (finding immunity from antitrust liability where "injuries for which [the plaintiff] seeks recovery flowed directly from government action").&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Massachusetts School of Law'', the Court held that where "the states are sovereign in imposing the bar admission requirements [the alleged anticompetitive restraints], the clear articulation and active supervision requirements . . . are inapplicable."&lt;ref&gt;107 F.3d at 1036.&lt;/ref&gt; There is less need for scrutiny "when the conduct is that of the sovereign itself . . . [because] the danger of unauthorized restraint of trade does not arise."&lt;ref&gt;[[PTI, Inc. v. Philip Morris, Inc.]], 100 F. Supp. 2d 1179, 1196 (C.D. Ca. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, concerns about the legitimacy of the action are reduced. The test to determine sufficient state involvement as sovereign is unnecessary when the state legislature or state supreme court acts directly. As the Supreme Court explained: "Closer analysis is required when the activity at issue is not directly that of the legislature or supreme court, but is carried out by others pursuant to state authorization.... When the conduct is that of the sovereign itself, on the other hand, the danger of unauthorized restraint of trade does not arise. When the conduct at issue is in fact that of the state legislature or supreme court, we need not address the issues of 'clear articulation' and 'active supervision.'&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hoover v. Ronwin]]'', {{ussc|466|558|1984|pin=568}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when it is uncertain whether an act should be treated as state action for the purposes of Parker immunity, courts apply the test set forth in ''[[California Retail Liquor Dealers Association v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.]]'' (1980)&lt;ref&gt;445 U.S. 97, 104 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; to "determine whether anticompetitive conduct engaged in by private parties should be deemed state action and thus shielded from the antitrust laws."&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick v. Burget]], 486 U.S. 94, 100 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; "First, the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy; second, the policy must be actively supervised by the State itself."&lt;ref&gt;445 U.S. 97, 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

# The Supreme Court has recognized state legislative and judicial action as sovereign under ''Parker''. But "closer analysis is required" when the action is less directly that of the legislature or judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hoover v. Ronwin]], 466 U.S. 558, 568 (1984) (relying in part on Midcal).&lt;/ref&gt; One Court of Appeals has decided that executive officers and agencies "are entitled to Parker immunity for actions taken pursuant to their constitutional or statutory authority, regardless whether these particular actions or their anticompetitive effects were contemplated by the legislature," without the need for ''Midcal'' analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charley's Taxi Radio Dispatch Corp. v. SIDA of Haw., Inc.]], 810 F.2d 869, 876 (9th Cir. 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;
# Parker, by its own terms, immunizes only states. But in order to give effect to Parker immunity, private parties to state action must also be immune.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Armstrong Surgical Ctr, Inc. v. Armstrong County Mem'l Hosp.]]'', 185 F.3d 154, 159 (3d Cir. 1999) ("If relief is sought solely for injury as to which the state would enjoy immunity under Parker, the private petitioner also enjoys immunity.").&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, plaintiffs could sue only the private parties and by winning antitrust judgments against them, could thwart state policies as if there were no state immunity. No state could enter into an agreement with private groups, even to further clear state policies, because the potential liability of the private groups would prevent them from joining. Artful pleading should not frustrate state policy.&lt;ref&gt;[[S. Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc., v. United States]], 471 U.S. 48, 56-57 (1985) (absent immunity for private parties, a "plaintiff could frustrate any [State] program merely by filing suit against the regulated private parties").&lt;/ref&gt; "If Parker immunity attaches, it would also reach the private participants of the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement|[tobacco] Multistate Settlement Agreement]]."&lt;ref name="BedellWholesale"/&gt;

In ''Midcal'', the Supreme Court clarified that requires states to meet two conditions before antitrust immunity will attach: "First, the challenged restraint must be 'one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy'; second, the policy must be 'actively supervised' by the State itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Midcal'', 445 U.S. at 105 (quoting ''City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co.'', 435 U.S. 389, 410 (1978)).&lt;/ref&gt; This clearly articulated state policy may be inferred "if suppression of competition is the 'foreseeable result' of what the statute authorizes".&lt;ref&gt;''Omni'', 499 U.S. at 372-73 (quoting ''Hallie v. Eau Claire'', 471 U.S. 34, 42 (1985)).&lt;/ref&gt; Under ''Midcal'', a state "may displace competition with active state supervision if the displacement is both intended by the State and implemented in its specific details. Actual state involvement, not deference to private pricefixing arrangements under the general auspices of state law, is the precondition for immunity from federal law."&lt;ref&gt;''Federal Trade Comm'n v. Ticor Title Ins. Co.'', 504 U.S. 621, 633 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

To qualify as state action under the ''Midcal'' test, "the challenged restraint must be one 'clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy.'"&lt;ref&gt;445 U.S. at 104 (quoting ''City of Lafayette v. La. Power &amp; Light Co.'', 435 U.S. 389, 410 (1978) (opinion of Brennan, J.)).&lt;/ref&gt; A government entity need not "be able to point to a specific, detailed, legislative authorization" to assert a successful Parker defense.&lt;ref&gt;''Lafayette'', 435 U.S. at 415.&lt;/ref&gt; But it must be evident that under the "clear articulation" standard the challenged restraint is part of state policy. As the Supreme Court has stated, "Midcal confirms that while a State may not confer antitrust immunity on private persons by fiat, it may displace competition with active state supervision if the displacement is both intended by the State and implemented in its specific details".&lt;ref&gt;''FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co.'', 504 U.S. 621, 633 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

The second prong of the ''Midcal'' test is whether the resulting antitrust violation was "actively supervised" by the state. This standard is more problematic. The essential inquiry of the "actively supervised" prong is to determine if the "anticompetitive scheme is the State's own".&lt;ref&gt;''FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co.'', 504 U.S. 621, 635 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The active supervision prong "requires that state officials have and exercise power to review particular anticompetitive acts of private parties and disapprove those that fail to accord with state policy."&lt;ref&gt;''Patrick v. Burget'', 486 U.S. 94, 101 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; "Absent such a program of supervision, there is no realistic assurance that a private party's anticompetitive conduct promotes state policy, rather than merely the party's individual interests." Id. at 100-01. "Such active state review is clearly necessary where private defendants are empowered with some type of discretionary authority in connection with the anticompetitive acts (e.g. to determine price or rate structures)."&lt;ref&gt;''Zimomra'', 111 F.3d at 1500.&lt;/ref&gt; Rubberstamp approval of private action does not constitute state action. A state must independently review and approve the anticompetitive behavior to satisfy this prong of the Parker doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, 486 U.S. at 101 ("The active supervision requirement mandates that the State exercise ultimate control over the challenged anticompetitive conduct."); Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. FTC, 998 F.2d 1129, 1139 (3d Cir. 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

A "hybrid restraint" is discussed by Justice Stevens in his concurrence in ''[[Rice v. Norman Williams Co.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;458 U.S. 654, 666-67 (1982) (Stevens, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt; They are not purely private actions, nor are they entirely attributable to the state in the manner of a legislative act. Hybrid restraints are not the type of sovereign state action found in ''Massachusetts School of Law'' or ''Zimomra'', that avoid ''Midcal'' treatment. Instead, hybrid restraints involve a degree of private action which calls for ''Midcal'' analysis.&lt;ref&gt;See Rice, 458 U.S. at 666 ("Hybrid restraints of this character require analysis that is different from a public regulatory scheme on the one hand, and a purely private restraint on the other.") (citations omitted) (Stevens, J., concurring).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PottersWheel''' is a [[MATLAB]] toolbox for mathematical modeling of time-dependent [[dynamical system]]s that can be expressed as [[chemical reaction network]]s or [[ordinary differential equations]] (ODEs).&lt;ref&gt;T. Maiwald and J. Timmer (2008) "Dynamical Modeling and Multi-Experiment Fitting with PottersWheel", ''Bioinformatics'' 24(18):2037–2043&lt;/ref&gt; It allows the automatic calibration of model parameters by fitting the model to experimental measurements. CPU-intensive functions are written or – in case of model dependent functions – dynamically generated in C. Modeling can be done interactively using graphical user interfaces or based on MATLAB scripts using the PottersWheel function library. The software is intended to support the work of a mathematical modeler as a real [[potter's wheel]] eases the modeling of pottery.

== Seven modeling phases ==

The basic use of PottersWheel covers seven phases from model creation to the prediction of new
experiments.

=== Model creation ===

[[File:Formalization-of-Jak-Stat-Pathway.png]]

The dynamical system is formalized into a set of reactions or differential equations using a visual model designer or a text editor. The model is stored as a MATLAB *.m ASCII file. Modifications can therefore be tracked using a version control system like [[subversion]] or [[Git (software)|git]]. Model import and export is supported for [[SBML]]. Custom import-templates may be used to import custom model structures. [[Rule-based modeling]] is also supported, where a pattern represents a set of automatically generated reactions.

Example for a simple model definition file for a reaction network A → B → C → A with observed species A and C:

&lt;source lang=matlab&gt;
function m = getModel();

% Starting with an empty model
m = pwGetEmtptyModel();

% Adding reactions
m = pwAddR(m, 'A', 'B');
m = pwAddR(m, 'B', 'C');
m = pwAddR(m, 'C', 'A');

% Adding observables
m = pwAddY(m, 'A');
m = pwAddY(m, 'C');
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Data import ===

External data saved in *.xls or *.txt files can be added to a model creating a ''model-data-couple''. A mapping dialog allows to connect data column names to observed species names. Meta information in the data files comprise information about the experimental setting. Measurement errors are either stored in the data files, will be calculated using an error model, or are estimated automatically.

=== Parameter calibration ===

To fit a model to one or more data sets, the corresponding model-data-couples are combined into a ''fitting-assembly''. Parameters like initial values, rate constants, and scaling factors can be fitted in an experiment-wise or global fashion. The user may select from several numerical integrators, optimization algorithms, and calibration strategies like fitting in normal or logarithmic parameter space.

=== Interpretation of the goodness-of-fit ===

[[File:Fitting-data-with-PottersWheel.png]]

The quality of a fit is characterized by its ''chi-squared'' value.  As a rule of thumb, for
''N'' fitted data points and ''p'' calibrated parameters, the chi-squared value should have a similar value
as ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'' or at least&amp;nbsp;''N''. Statistically, this is expressed using a [[chi-squared test]] resulting in a [[p-value]] above a significance threshold of e.g.&amp;nbsp;0.05. For lower p-values, the model is

* either not able to explain the data and has to be refined,
* the standard deviation of the data points is actually larger than specified,
* or the used fitting strategy was not successful and the fit was trapped in a local minimum.

Apart from further chi-squared based characteristics like [[Akaike information criterion|AIC]] and [[Bayesian information criterion|BIC]], data-model-residual analyses exist, e.g. to investigate whether the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] follow a [[Gaussian distribution]]. Finally, parameter [[confidence intervals]] may be estimated using either the [[Fisher information matrix]] approximation or based on the [[profile-likelihood function]], if parameters are not unambiguously identifiable.

If the fit is not acceptable, the model has to be refined and the procedure continues with step 2. Else, the dynamic model properties can be examined and predictions calculated.

=== Model refinement ===

If the model structure is not able to explain the experimental measurements, a set of physiologically reasonable alternative models should be created. In order to avoid redundant model paragraphs and copy-and-paste errors, this can be done using a common core-model which is the same for all variants.  Then, ''daughter''-models are created and fitted to the data, preferably using batch processing strategies based on MATLAB scripts. As a starting point to envision suitable model variants, the PottersWheel ''equalizer'' may be used to understand the dynamic behavior of the original system.

=== Model analysis and prediction ===

A mathematical model may serve to display the concentration time-profile of unobserved species, to determine sensitive parameters representing potential targets within a clinical setting, or to calculate model characteristics like the half-life of a species.

Each analysis step may be stored into a modeling report, which may be exported as a Latex-based PDF.

=== Experimental design ===

An experimental setting corresponds to specific characteristics of ''driving input functions'' and
initial concentrations. In a signal transduction pathway model the concentration of a ligand
like EGF may be controlled experimentally.  The driving input designer allows investigating the effect of a continuous, ramp, or pulse stimulation in combination with varying initial concentrations using the equalizer.  In order to discriminate competing model hypotheses, the designed experiment should have as different observable time-profiles as possible.

== Parameter identifiability ==

Many dynamical systems can only be observed partially, i.e. not all system species are accessible experimentally. For biological applications the amount and quality of experimental data is often limited. In this setting parameters can be structurally or practically non-identifiable. Then, parameters may compensate each other and fitted parameter values strongly depend on initial guesses. In PottersWheel non-identifiability can be detected using the [[Profile Likelihood Approach]].&lt;ref&gt;''Structural and practical identifiability analysis of partially observed dynamical models by exploiting the profile likelihood'', A. Raue, C. Kreutz, T. Maiwald, J. Bachmann, M. Schilling, U. Klingmüller and J. Timmer, Bioinformatics 2009
&lt;/ref&gt; For characterizing functional relationships between the non-identifiable parameters PottersWheel applies random and systematic fit sequences.&lt;ref&gt;''Data-based identifiability analysis of non-linear dynamical models'', S. Hengl, C. Kreutz, J. Timmer and T. Maiwald, Bioinformatics 2007 23(19):2612–2618&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pratyekabuddha''' or '''paccekabuddha''' ([[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], respectively), literally "a lone [[Buddhahood|buddha]]", "a buddha on their own" or "a private buddha", is one of three types of [[bodhi|enlightened]] beings according to some schools of [[Buddhism]]. The other two buddha types are the [[arhat]] and the ''[[Buddhahood#Samyaksambuddha|sammāsambuddha]]'' (Sanskrit ''samyaksambuddha'').

==Characteristics==

===General overview===
The ''[[yana (Buddhism)|yāna]]'' or "vehicle" by which pratyekabuddhas achieve enlightenment is called the [[pratyekabuddhayāna]] in Indian Buddhist tradition.

Pratyekabuddhas are said to achieve enlightenment on their own, without the use of teachers or guides, according some traditions by seeing and understanding [[pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]]. They are said to arise only in ages where there is no Buddha and the Buddhist teachings (Sanskrit: [[dharma]]; Pāli: ''dhamma'') are lost. "The idea of a Paccekabuddha … is interesting, as much as it implies that even when the four truths are not preached they still exist and can be discovered by anyone who makes the necessary mental and moral effort".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Eliot, [https://archive.org/details/hinduismandbuddh15255gut Hinduism and Buddhism], 3 Volumes, London, 1922, I 344–5&lt;/ref&gt; Many may arise at a single time.

According to the [[Theravada]] school, paccekabuddhas ("one who has attained to supreme and perfect insight, but who dies without proclaiming the truth to the world")&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/pa/pacceka_buddha.htm&lt;/ref&gt; are unable to teach the Dhamma, which requires&lt;ref&gt;Kloppenborg , Ria (1983). [http://www.bps.lk/olib/wh/wh305-p.html The Paccekabuddha: A Buddhist Ascetic] - A Study of the Concept of the Paccekabuddha in Pali Canonical and Commentarial Literature, The Wheel Publication No. 305–7, Kandy, Sri Lanka: Buddhist Publication Society &lt;/ref&gt; the omniscience and supreme compassion of a sammāsambuddha, and even he hesitates to attempt to teach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn06/sn06.001.than.html Ayacana Sutta: The Request (SN 6.1)] translated from the Pali by [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] @ [http://www.accesstoinsight.org Access to Insight]&lt;/ref&gt; Paccekabuddha give moral teachings but do not bring others to enlightenment. They leave no [[sangha]] as a legacy to carry on the Dhamma.

===In the ''Abhidharmasamuccaya''===
In the fourth-century Mahayana [[abhidharma]] work, the ''Abhidharma-samuccaya'', Asaṅga describes followers of the Pratyekabuddhayāna as those who dwell alone like a [[Indian rhinoceros|rhinoceros]] or as solitary conquerors (Skt. ''pratyekajina'') living in small groups.&lt;ref&gt;Boin-Webb, Sara (tr). Rahula, Walpola (tr). Asanga. ''Abhidharma Samuccaya: The Compendium of Higher Teaching.'' 2001. pp. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; Here they are characterized as utilizing the same canon of texts as the [[śrāvaka]]s, the Śrāvaka Piṭaka, but having a different set of teachings, the "Pratyekabuddha Dharma".&lt;ref&gt;Boin-Webb, Sara (tr). Rahula, Walpola (tr). Asanga. ''Abhidharma Samuccaya: The Compendium of Higher Teaching.'' 2001. pp. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;

A very early sutra, the ''[[Rhinoceros Sutra]]'', uses the exact metaphor of Asaṅga. The ''Rhinoceros Sutra'' is one of the [[Gandhāran Buddhist texts]], which are the oldest Buddhist texts known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salomon|first1=Richard|authorlink1=Richard G. Salomon (academic) |last2=Glass|first2=Andrew|title=A Gāndhārī Version of the Rhinoceros Sūtra: British Library Kharoṣṭhī Fragment 5B|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTmN8Xs9xBkC|year=2000|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-98035-5|page=10,13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text is also present in the [[Pāli Canon]]; in the [[Sutta Pitaka]], a [[Pali]] ''Rhinoceros Sutta'' is the third sutta in the [[Khuddaka Nikaya]]'s [[Sutta Nipata]]'s first chapter ([[Sutta Nipata|Sn]] 1.3).{{sfn|Thanissaro Bhikkhu|1997}}

==In the Jātakas==
Pratyekabuddhas (e.g. Darīmukha J.378, Sonaka J.529) appear as teachers of Buddhist doctrine in pre-Buddhist times in several of the [[Jataka tales]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2737">The '''Press–Schechter formalism''' is a [[mathematical model]] for predicting the number of objects (such as [[galaxies]] or [[galaxy clusters]]) of a certain mass within a given volume of the Universe. It was described in a famous [[Academic paper|paper]] by [[William H. Press]] and [[Paul L. Schechter|Paul Schechter]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1974ApJ...187..425P Formation of Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies by Self-Similar Gravitational Condensation], W.H. Press, P. Schechter, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the context of [[Dark matter|cold dark matter]] cosmological models,
perturbations on all scales are imprinted on the universe at very early times,
for example by quantum fluctuations during an [[Inflationary cosmology|inflationary era]].
Later, as radiation redshifts away, these become mass perturbations, and they
start to grow linearly.  Only long after that, starting with small mass scales
and advancing over time to larger mass scales, do the perturbations actually
collapse to form (for example) galaxies or clusters of galaxies, in so-called
hierarchical structure formation (see [[Physical cosmology]]).

Press and Schechter observed that the fraction of mass in collapsed objects
more massive than some mass M is related to the fraction of volume samples
in which the smoothed initial density fluctuations are above some
density threshold.  This yields a formula for the mass function (distribution
of masses) of objects at any given time.

==Result==

The Press–Schechter formalism predicts that the number of objects with mass between &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M+dM&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;N(M)dM = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\left(1+\frac{n}{3}\right)\frac{\bar{\rho}}{M^2}\left(\frac{M}{M^*}\right)^{\left(3+n\right)/6}\exp\left(-\left(\frac{M}{M^*}\right)^{\left(3+n\right)/3}\right)dM&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean (baryonic and dark) matter density of the universe, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the index of the power spectrum of the fluctuations in the early universe &lt;math&gt;P(k)\propto k^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;M^*&lt;/math&gt; is a critical mass above which structures will form.

Qualitatively, the prediction is that the mass distribution is a power law for
small masses, with an exponential cutoff above some characteristic mass that
increases with time.  Such functions had previously been noted by Schechter
as observed [[Luminosity function (astronomy)|luminosity functions]],
and are now known as Schechter luminosity functions.  The Press-Schechter
formalism provided the first quantitative model for how such functions might
arise.

'''Psychic damage''' is a concept used in the field of [[social psychology]] to describe the negative effects of [[stereotypes]] on individual members of [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] groups. The label "psychic damage" was first used by U.S. historian [[Daryl Scott (historian)|Daryl Scott]] to describe the effects of stereotyping on [[African-Americans]] in his 1997 book ''Contempt and Pity: Social Policy and the Image of the Damaged Black Psyche, 1880–1996'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Whistling Vivaldi: How Stereotypes Affect Us and What We Can Do (Issues of Our Time)|last = Steele|first = Claude M.|publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year = 2011|isbn = 0393339726|location = |pages = 46–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which won the [[Organization of American Historians]]' [[James A.

In his book ''[[Claude Steele#Whistling Vivaldi|Whistling Vivaldi: How Stereotypes Affect Us and What We Can Do]],'' U.S. social psychologist Claude Steele wrote that the psyches of individual African-Americans gets damaged "by bad images of the group projected in society -- images of blacks as aggressive, as less intelligent, and so on." Repeated exposure to these images, he wrote, is [[Internalization|internalized]] by members of the stigmatized group, which damages their character by causing low self-esteem, low expectations, low motivation and self-doubt, and contributes to societal problems such as high [[unemployment]], poor marriage success, low educational achievement and [[criminality]].

Initially the concept of psychic damage was used to describe the effects of stigmatization on African-Americans, but the concept has also been applied to other stigmatized groups, such as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.law.ou.edu/content/american-indian-law-review-2|title = |last = |first = |date = 2003|journal = American Indian Law Review |volume=28|accessdate = 29 November 2014|doi = |pmid = |page = 81}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino people]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Bust Guide to the New Girl Order|last = Karp|first = Marcelle|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminists Doing Ethics|last = DesAutels|first = Peggy|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sabina Guzzanti''' (born 25 July 1963) is an Italian [[satire|satirist]], [[actress]], writer and producer whose work is devoted to examining social and political life in Italy.

==Early life==
Born in [[Rome]] as the eldest daughter of celebrated Italian [[political commentator]] and journalist [[Paolo Guzzanti]] (former senator of [[Forza Italia]], incumbent deputy and deputy secretary for [[Italian Liberal Party (2004)|Italian liberal party]]), she graduated from the [[Accademia Nazionale di Arte Drammatica Silvio D'Amico|Academy of Dramatic Arts of Rome]].&lt;ref name=leonardo&gt;[http://biografie.leonardo.it/biografia.htm?BioID=225&amp;biografia=Sabina+Guzzanti Biography] on Leonardo.it&lt;/ref&gt; Her first appearances on stage were at the side of her brother [[Corrado Guzzanti|Corrado]], a skilled comedian known for parody and imitation.

==Career==
Guzzanti's career began when she took part in a series of successful television comedy formats such as ''Proffimamente... non stop'' (directed by [[Enzo Trapani]]), ''L'araba fenice'' (directed by [[Antonio Ricci (producer)|Antonio Ricci]]), ''La TV delle ragazze'' and ''Scusate l'interruzione'';&lt;ref name=repubblica_profile&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/trovacinema/scheda_personaggio.jsp?long=true&amp;idContent=155096 Profile] on [[La Repubblica]]'s website - Cinema section.&lt;/ref&gt; her imitations of the famous Italian porn star [[Moana Pozzi]] gave her popularity, and the Italian film director [[Giuseppe Bertolucci]] recruited her to star in his film ''I Cammelli''.&lt;ref name=leonardo /&gt; Her career in this period was at its apex, as she starred in several films, toured Italian theatres with her own comedy shows (such as ''Con fervido zelo'' in 1991, and ''Non io: Sabina e le altre'' in 1994&lt;ref name=repubblica_profile /&gt;), and even held her one-woman show ''La posta del cuore''. Her first attempt at directing is the 1998 short ''Donna selvaggia''.

In November 2003 Sabina Guzzanti wrote, directed and was featured in the first and only installment of ''[[Raiot]]'', a late-night TV political satire show broadcast on [[Rai Tre]]. After lampooning Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi, she was sued by [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Mediaset]] lawyers (notably [[Cesare Previti]]'s law firm) for "lies and insinuation" and the show was pulled amid controversy; in the suing document Previti defined satire as "that thing which tends to minimize and to make a politician likeable, to diminish the social tensions" ("''quella cosa che tende a sdrammatizzare e a rendere simpatico un politico, a diminuire le tensioni sociali''"&lt;ref name=unita&gt;[http://www.disinformazione.it/intervistasabina.htm Interview with Sabina Guzzanti], excerpt from an article of [[L'Unità]]&lt;/ref&gt;) as the basis to accuse the show of not being satirical but a direct political attack. As a form of protest, the second instalment was recorded live in the Auditorium of Rome and broadcast by independent television networks; during the event among others [[Dario Fo]], [[Beppe Grillo]] and [[Daniele Luttazzi]] gave her their support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kataweb.it/speciali/guzzanti_auditorium/index.html Kataweb | Speciali | Raiot all'Auditorium&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After that Sabina Guzzanti announced that the only official instalment of Raiot had completely vanished from the [[RAI]]'s archives.&lt;ref name=unita /&gt;

As a form of protest against the censorship imposed on ''RaiOt'', Sabina Guzzanti shot her side of the story in the film ''[[Viva Zapatero!|Viva Zapatero]]'' (2005) in which she shows and condemns the lack of freedom of expression in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jul/21/worldcinema.documentary|title=Viva Zapatero!|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|date=2006-07-21|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premier of ''Viva Zapatero!'' is in [[Venice Film Festival]] and there’s a great success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/markets-festivals/viva-zapatero-1200521579/|title=Viva Zapatero!|last=Weissberg|first=Jay|date=2005-09-26|work=Variety|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Viva Zapatero!'' is invited in many others International Film Festival: Tribeca Film Festival, Sundance Film Festival and San Sebastian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemaitaliano.info/film/00210/festival/viva-zapatero.html|title=Festival e premi: Viva Zapatero!

At the end of 2005 she was once again allowed on television to feature in the last installment of [[Adriano Celentano]]'s show ''Rockpolitik'', but the producers "forbade" her to speak about [[Silvio Berlusconi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/2005/k/sezioni/spettacoli_e_cultura/cele2/guzz/guzz.html Silvio? Non gradivano, ho trattato sulle battute], interview with Gino Castaldo for [[La Repubblica]]&lt;/ref&gt; After the victory of [[L'Unione]] in the [[Italian general election, 2006|2006 elections]] and the progressive fading of Berlusconi's influence on the RAI, she declared she still wouldn't return to work at the RAI unless serious reforms were launched to make the company's management independent from the politicians.&lt;ref name=corriere&gt;[http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Spettacoli/2006/05_Maggio/29/conti.shtml La Guzzanti: non tornerò in una Rai lottizzata dall’Unione], interview with Paolo Conti for [[Corriere della Sera]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007  she direct her second movie, ''[[Sympathy for the Lobster]] (Le Ragioni dell’Aragosta),'' a comedy which featured the comedians from ''Avanzi'', a popular political satire show much in vogue in the early nineties.

In July 2008, in front of thousands of cheering onlookers at Piazza Navona, Rome, Guzzanti made hate speech remarks about the Pope, saying that he would be dead in 20 years, and would end up in [[Hell]] as punishment for the Church's treatment of homosexuals, saying that he would soon be "tormented by great big demons - and very active (sexual) ones". Although threatened with punishments of up to five years in prison for these comments, she was not prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Stewart.

In 2010 her third featured film, ''Draquila. Italy Trembles ([[Draquila – L'Italia che trema|Draquila]])'', is out of competition at [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/draquila-italy-trembles-film-review-1004089880.story|title=Draquila: Italy Trembles -- Film Review|website=www1.hollywoodreporter.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It’s a report of the events tied to the earthquake in L’Aquila, and an intense and disturbing story about the effects of autocracy.

In 2011 Guzzanti directs ''Franca la Prima'', her personal homage to one of the most important actress in Italy, Franca Valeri.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.it/show/speciale-roma-2011/2011/10/31/festival-di-roma-sabina-guzzanti-franca-valeri-documentario|title=Roma s'inchina a Franca Valeri|website=www.vanityfair.it|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same year Sabina back to theatre with ''Sì, Sì, Sì….oh Sì!'', a funny voyage through Italy's most important personalities from both the social and political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://teatro.persinsala.it/si-si-si-oh-si/3533|title=Sì, sì, sì… oh, sì! – Persinsala Teatro|website=teatro.persinsala.it|language=it-IT|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012 Guzzanti come back to TV with a new show, ''Un due tre…Stella!'' on [[La7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/12_marzo_12/guzzanti-torna-piccolo-schermo_fb498a4e-6c56-11e1-bd93-2c78bee53b56.shtml|title="Un, due, tre stella": Sabina Guzzanti torna in tv|last=Online|first=Redazione|work=Corriere della Sera|access-date=2018-01-23|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, her last featured film, ''[[The State-Mafia Pact|The State Mafia Pact]]'' (''La Trattativa''), is screened at the 71st [[Venice Film Festival]]. It's an accurate reconstruction of one of the most dark periods of Italian history: the pact between State and Mafia during the 90s and its effect on democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/festivals/film-review-the-state-mafia-pact-1201306218/|title=Film Review: ‘The State-Mafia Pact’|last=Weissberg|first=Jay|date=2014-09-16|work=Variety|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2015 Guzzanti stars a new project, a web news satire called ''TG Porco'' which is financed by a crowdfunding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/11/17/sabina-guzzanti-tgporco-se-vi-e-piaciuto-aiutateci-a-produrlo-la-campagna-di-crowdfunding/440477/|title=Sabina Guzzanti: "TgPorco?

In the same year she backs to theatre again with her new show, ''Come Ne Venimmo Fuori. Proiezioni dal Futuro'' which is a satiric monologue, an hilarious and punctual reflection on the post-capitalist and neo-liberal policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli/teatro-danza/2015/10/14/news/sabina_guzzanti_sul_palco_per_dirvi_dal_futuro_quanto_eravamo_feroci_nel_2015_-125055518/|title=Sabina Guzzanti: "Sul palco per dirvi dal futuro quanto eravamo feroci nel 2015"|date=2015-10-14|work=Spettacoli - La Repubblica|access-date=2018-01-23|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1987, Sabina Guzzanti has practiced [[Nichiren Buddhism]] as a member of the global Buddhist association [[Soka Gakkai International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgi-italia.org/riviste/bs/InternaTesto.php?A=1616&amp;R=1&amp;C=122 Article on Buddismo e Società]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Sabina Guzzanti is accused by various actors, politicians and writers of "aggression" against certain figures, mainly [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and his supporters. 
She has also derided the [[cancer]] of the journalist [[Oriana Fallaci]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPoAeLAaMF0&amp;feature=player_embedded Sabina Guzzanti deride the Oriana Fallaci's cancer - YouTube&lt;!-- Titolo generato automaticamente --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qelsi.it/2011/come-la-guzzanti-derideva-il-cancro-di-oriana-fallaci/ Come la Guzzanti derideva il cancro di Oriana Fallaci], Quelsi Quotidiano, 12 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; when during Fallaci's parody, a man shouted " May you as well get a cancer" (''Che ti venga un cancro''), and Guzzanti reply "I also already have it; and may it come to your mother too " (''Ce l'ho già e venisse anche alla tua mamma''). She also insulted [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and former Minister of Equal Opportunity [[Mara Carfagna]], who was accused by Guzzanti of [[fellating]] [[Silvio Berlusconi]], as reported by Carfagna herself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilmessaggero.it/articolo.php?id=32531&amp;sez=HOME_INITALIA Sabina Guzzanti, la Carfagna chiede un milione  di danni.

After the scandal of the alleged "Madoff of Parioli," Sabina Guzzanti admitted to having given money to investors, as well. Aware of having been a victim of a scam, she said that she "felt like an idiot", claiming to have put in 150,000 €. Such revelation sparked another series of controversies, since during her speeches and her shows, she had always declared her opposition to this kind of practice, deemed typical of [[tax evader]]s. Guzzanti would have received - had everything gone as promised - earnings on her investments abroad, then exempt from taxation, within Italy itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/i-rivoluzionari-adessocadono-sulla-pensione.html I rivoluzionari adessocadono sulla pensione], Il Giornale, 1 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Samkhya]] system, which follows [[Prakṛti|Prakrti]] – parinama-vada, describes origination and evolution through its theory of '''Satkaryavada''' ({{lang-sa|सत्कार्यवाद}}) which is the theory of causation. According to this theory the effect is existent in the cause; the original cause of everything that is perceived is [[Prakrti]].

==Overview==

''Satkaryavada''  is the [[Samkhya]] theory of the pre-existent effect, which states that the effect (''karya'') already exists in its material cause and therefore, nothing new is brought into existence or produced in the process of creation. This theory, also associated with the [[Yoga]] school, is the systematic unfolding of [[Aruni|Uddalaka Aruni]]’s '[[Substance theory|substantialism]]' and '[[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]]' ([[Sassatavada]]).  Ishvarakrishna in his ''[[Samkhyakarika]]'' Sl.9 gives five reasons why the effect has to pre-exist in its material cause – a) what is not cannot be produced, b) the effect requires a material cause, c) not everything arises from everything, d) the cause produces only what corresponds to its potential and e) the effect has the nature of the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On Being and What There Is|author=Wihelm Halbfass|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=28, 56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7cLHPj1dj8C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=Satkaryavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZsT-UqqBC8Xn4gSIh4FY&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Satkaryavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedic roots==

During [[Vedic]] times, in seeking to determine the [[Ṛta|rta]] or order underlying all phenomena, a postulation was made that change can be understood in terms of a potency inherent in these phenomena, that is, in the cause to produce the effect, this potency was termed ''svadha'' (own power). But later on, the reality of change itself came into question. However, the [[Upanishads]] and [[Samkhya]], though differing on whether phenomenal change was an illusion or real, accepted ''satkaryavada''. ''Svadha'' and ''satkaryavada'' go beyond efficient causation to partake of nature of formal and material cause. [[Pratītyasamutpāda]] of the [[Buddhist]]s implies a non-linear kind of causality; the word ''paccaya'' of ''paccaya-namarupa'' literally means support, and this presents causation not in terms of unilateral power but in terms of relationship. The [[Buddhist]]s consider all modes of relation to have casual significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mutual Causality in Buddhism and General Systems|author=Joana Macy|publisher=SUNY Press|page=15,32,52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JXMqPJ-_eY0C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=Satkaryavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uMj-UtW9Doqu4ATNvIGADQ&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Satkaryavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedanta explanation==

From [[Chandogya Upanishad]] III.19 and [[Taittiriya Upanishad]] II.7, it appears that being emerged from the pregnant and undifferentiated chaos known as ''asat'' ('non-being') but the [[Brahmanas]] describe creation as the transformation of sat referred to as the impersonal abstract reality (Taittiriya Upanishad II.i ) or as the personal creator ([[Prasna Upanishad]] I.4); ''satkaryavada'' envisages creation as ''parinama::[[vikara]]'' ('modification') of Brahman ([[Brahma Sutras]] II.i.7) which orthodox view is not accepted by the followers of [[Advaita Vedanta]] who place their belief in [[Vivartavada]], the theory of superimposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism|author=Richard King|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=58, 78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1bASTAOhjoC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=Satkaryavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ycX-UprfHK2L4gT444HoCw&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Satkaryavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gaudapada]], advocating ''ajativada'', states that [[Mithyatva|mithya]] ('false', 'unreal') effect has a ''mithya'' origination; it is not a real origination. Therefore, [[Totakacharya]], a disciple of Sankara,  in ''Srutisarasamuddharanam'' Sloka 151 states - even if one thinks that the world, beginning with the mind, does somehow originate according to either the prior existence or the non-existence (of the effect), even then it is not real; for the [[Śruti|sruti]] has declared that it is unreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Extracting the Essence of the Sruti|author=Totakacarya|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-eq605vuwUC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=Satkaryavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TML-Uoa0J4nNygP4kICoCw&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Satkaryavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Vedanta]], [[Brahman]], the ever-existing [[Nondualism|non-dual]] entity ''sat'' but who is the eternal subject and not an object to be known, is the sole source of joy (''rasah''), a non-entity cannot be a source of happiness. Brahman is the cause of creation. As [[Saguna Brahman]] or [[Ishvara]], with his power of the beginningless [[Maya (illusion)|maya]], he brings forth this creation which is also beginningless, controls and rules it as the Lord within. Maya is [[Prakrti]] (''avayakrta'') composed of three [[Gunas]]. [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] extends ''satkaryavada'' to state that creation is but manifestation of names and forms only; by transforming into Becoming the indeterminate becomes determinate in association with ''maya'', otherwise the world is unreal – the acosmic approach shows creation to be a superimposition on Brahman whereas according to the subjective approach the phenomenal world of diversity is unreal, a mere dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roots of Vedanta|author=S Trans Rangaswami|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=165, 213|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2snhxaaWDAYC&amp;pg=PA458&amp;dq=Satkaryavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ycX-UprfHK2L4gT444HoCw&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Satkaryavada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sankara defends ''satkaryavada'' against ''asatkaryavada'' but in the light of ''[[vivartavada]]'' as distinguished from ''[[Parinama-vada (Hindu thought)|parinamavada]]'', he posits the infinite and eternal as the goal of human aspirations, distinguishing ''paramartha'' and ''vyavahara'' and agreeing that the former is timeless and the latter, fundamentally impermanent and insubstantial, differing though in their analysis of empirical things and causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Life and Thought of Sankaracarya|author=Govinda Chandra Pande|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=259|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nAiyujUqTwYC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq=Satkaryavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S8j-UrWUNaKK4ATqgoGoDw&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Satkaryavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that the sruti speaks of ''[[Prarabdha karma|prarabdha]]'' from an empirical point of view; ''prarabdha'' is accepted for origination (or birth) to account for differences of beings etc., which difference cannot be otherwise produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Sankara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Chandrasekhara Bharati|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=437|quote=St.462-463|url=  http://www.worldcat.org/title/vivekacudamani-of-sri-samkara-bhagvatpata-with-an-english-translation-of-the-commentary-in-samskrt-by-jagadguru-sri-candrasekhara-bharati-svaminah-sri-samkaracarya-of-sarada-pitha-srngeri/oclc/633667305}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same context but opposing Sankara’s view-point, [[Ramanuja]], the proponent of [[Vishishtadvaita]], in his ''Vedarthasangraha'' defines creation thus – Brahman whose body is formed by animate and inanimate beings, who in his gross form is divided by distinctions of names and forms, is presented in the effect; this disunited and gross state of Brahman is called creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sankara and Indian Philosophy|author=N.V.Isaeva|publisher=SUNY Press|page=222|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hshaWu0m1D4C&amp;pg=PA222&amp;dq=Satkaryavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TML-Uoa0J4nNygP4kICoCw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Satkaryavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; LA_Una=the one&amp;only(via;birth mother inner voice),known information from her inner soul.

==Samkhya delineation==

Satkaryavada is the [[Samkhya]] theory of the pre-existent effect, that the effect ({{lang|sa-Latn|karya}}) already exists in its material cause and therefore, nothing new is brought into existence or produced in the process of creation. This theory, also associated with the [[Yoga]] school, is the systematic unfolding of Udalaka Aruni’s  ([[Chandogya Upanishad]] VI.i.4-5) 'substantialism' and 'eternalism'.  Ishvarakrishna in his [[Samkhyakarika]] (Sloka 9):

:असदकर्णाद् उपादान ग्रहणात् सर्वसम्भवाभावात् |
:शक्तस्य शक्यकर्णात् कारणभावाच्च सत्कार्यम् ||

gives five reasons why the effect has to pre-exist in its material cause – a) {{lang|sa-Latn|asadkarnat}} - what is not cannot be produced, b) {{lang|sa-Latn|upadana grahanat}} - the effect requires a material cause, c) {{lang|sa-Latn|sarvasambhavabhavat}} - not everything arises from everything, d) {{lang|sa-Latn|saktasya-sakya-karnat}} - the cause produces only what corresponds to its potential and e) {{lang|sa-Latn|karanabhavat}} - the effect has the nature of the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On Being and What There Is|author=Wihelm Halbfass|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=28, 56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7cLHPj1dj8C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=Satkaryavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZsT-UqqBC8Xn4gSIh4FY&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Satkaryavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The followers of the Samkhya school hold that {{lang|sa-Latn|karya}} ('effect') is {{lang|sa-Latn|sat}} ('existent') even before {{lang|sa-Latn|karakavyapara}} ('causal operation') renders {{lang|sa-Latn|avirbhuta}} ('manifest') from {{lang|sa-Latn|tirohita}} ('unmanifest condition'). The Samkhyas uphold Parinama-vada, that the cause is continuously transforming itself into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Indian Philosophy Vol. 1|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=258|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=Satkaryavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zcf-UrWCJuyN4wTO94GYCQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Satkaryavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They advocate two eternal realities, ''[[Prakrti]]'' and ''[[Purusha]]''; the five-fold reasoning for the inference of ''Purusha'' are ([[Samkhyakarika]] Sl.10)–

:हेतुमद् अनित्यमव्यापि सक्रियमनेकमाश्रितं लिङ्गम् |
:सावयवं परतन्त्रं व्यक्तं विपरीतमव्यक्तम् ||

''Prakrti'' and its evolutes all serve the purpose of the self which is Consciousness, b) the self whose purpose is served by ''Prakrti'' must be different from everything composed of the three gunas, c) experiences suggest a transcendental synthetic unity of pure consciousness to co-ordinate all experiences for knowledge pre-supposes the existence of the self, d) the physical universe needs a sentient [[purusha]] to experience it and e) there is the desire to escape from [[Prakṛti|prakrti]] (''[[Samkhyakarika]]'' Sl.10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy|author=Jay L.Garfield|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F06FKmKKIXwC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Satkaryavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zcf-UrWCJuyN4wTO94GYCQ&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Satkaryavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==

Asatkaryavada also called the arambhavada or new beginning. Against the ''asatkaryavada''  view of causality accepted by the [[Nyaya]] and the [[Vaisheshika]]s, the Samkhyas aver that if the effect were something totally new, without prior existence in any form, then one would have to admit the production of existence from non-existence, which is not possible. But Sankara questions the Samkhya contention, he asks – if the effect actually pre-exists how can there be genuine change?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion|publisher=Routledge|page=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UMaenE1H-JEC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=Satkaryavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Lcn-Up-3Keer4AS324G4CA&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Satkaryavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for the Study of Evolution''' is a professional organization of [[evolutionary biologists]]. It was formed in the [[United States]] in 1946 to promote [[evolution]] and the integration of various fields of science concerned with evolution and to organize the publication of a scientific journal to report on new research on evolution across a variety of fields.

The Society was established at a meeting in St. Louis on March 30, 1946. Fifty-seven scientists attended the meeting, which was chaired by [[Alfred E. Emerson]]. [[George Gaylord Simpson]] was elected as the Society's first President, with [[E. B. Babcock]], Emerson, and [[J. T. Patterson]] as his Vice-presidents and [[Ernst Mayr]] as secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Cain, Joseph. 1994.

For the 'promotion' and 'integration' of various fields: first years of ''Evolution'', 1947-1949. ''Archives of Natural History'' '''27''': 231-259.&lt;/ref&gt; This society grew as an extension of the US [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]'s Committee on Common Problems of Genetics and Paleontology (later renamed the Committee on Common Problems of Genetics, Paleontology and Systematics).&lt;ref&gt;Cain, Joe, ed. 2004. Exploring the borderlands: documents of the Committee on Common Problems of Genetics, Paleontology, and Systematics, 1943-1944. ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society''.

''Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences''. ''33'': 283-313.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first annual meeting of the society was held in Boston, December 28–31, 1946. A grant from the [[American Philosophical Society]] led to the publication of the journal ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]''.

Commonly known as 'evolution meeting,' the annual conference is often held together with the [[Society of Systematic Biologists]] and the [[American Society of Naturalists]].

The society has an official journal ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]''. It was started in 1947 and is published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Evolution''|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15585646|website=Wiley Online Library|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, it launched a second journal ''Evolution Letters''.&lt;ref&gt;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/20563744&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solitary confinement''' is a form of [[imprisonment]] distinguished by living in single cells with little or no contact to other inmates, strict measures to control [[contraband]], and the use of additional security measures and equipment. It is specifically designed for disruptive inmates that are security risks to other inmates, the prison staff, or the prison itself. It is mostly employed for violations of discipline, such as [[murder]], [[hostage-taking]], [[deadly assault]], and [[riot]]ing. However, it is also used as a measure of protection for inmates, whose safety is threatened by other inmates. Prison authorities consider solitary confinement an administrative placement measure, not a punishment.

Solitary confinement is colloquially referred to in [[American English]] as "the hotbox", "the hole", "AdSeg" (administrative segregation), the "SHU" (pronounced "shoe"), an acronym for "Special Housing Unit" or "Security Housing Unit"; in [[Australian English]] as "the Slot" or "the Pound"; in [[British English]] as "the block", "The Segregation Unit", or "the cooler".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/defence/5559761/Army-captain-was-real-life-Cooler-King-from-The-Great-Escape.html |title=Army captain was real life 'Cooler King' from The Great Escape |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |author=&lt;!--no by-line--&gt; |date=17 June 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/3517476.stm |title=Cooler King recalls Great Escape |work=[[BBC News]] |author=&lt;!--no by-line--&gt; |date=16 March 2004 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been called prison "'segregation' and 'restrictive housing.'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Solitary confinement has received severe criticism for having detrimental psychological effects&lt;ref name="arrigo" /&gt; and, to some and in some cases, constituting [[torture]].&lt;ref name="gawande9" /&gt; According to a 2017 review study, "a robust scientific literature has established the negative psychological effects of solitary confinement", leading to "an emerging consensus among correctional as well as professional, mental health, legal, and human rights organizations to drastically limit the use of solitary confinement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haney|first=Craig|date=2017-11-03|title=Restricting the Use of Solitary Confinement|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092326|journal=Annual Review of Criminology|doi=10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092326|issn=2572-4568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical controversy ==

Research surrounding the possible psychological and physiological effects of solitary confinement dates back to the 1830s. When the new prison discipline of separate confinement was introduced at the [[Eastern State Penitentiary]] in Philadelphia in 1829, commentators attributed the high rates of mental breakdown to the system of isolating prisoners in their cells. Charles Dickens, who visited the Philadelphia Penitentiary during his travels to America, described the "slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Notes|last=Dickens|first=Charles|publisher=Chapman and Hall|year=1842|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prison records from the Denmark institute in 1870 to 1920 indicate that staff noticed inmates were exhibiting signs of mental illnesses while in isolation, revealing that the persistent problem has been around for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter Scharff |last=Smith |title='Degenerate Criminals': Mental Health and Psychiatric Studies of Danish Prisoners in Solitary Confinement, 1870–1920 |journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior |date=August 2008 |volume=35 |number=8 |pages=1048–1064 |doi=10.1177/0093854808318782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first comment by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] about solitary confinement's effect on prisoner mental status was made in 1890 (In re Medley 134 U.S. 160).&lt;ref&gt;https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/In_re_Medley/Opinion_of_the_Court&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; In it the court found that the use of solitary confinement produced reduced mental and physical capabilities.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; The use of solitary confinement in prisons was first introduced to regulate unruly prisoners and keep them away from the rest of the prison society (Haney, Craig; Lynch, Mona). However, solitary confinement has been linked to several developments of mental disorders, one of which being [[Ganser syndrome]]. A man developed Ganser syndrome after being held in solitary confinement for a long term sentence; however, that development is seen as rare and is unlikely in most cases.

The effects of solitary confinement on mental health are undeniable. According to the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry online, solitary confinement can cause an array of mental disorders, as well as provoke an already existing mental disorder in a prisoner, causing more trauma and symptoms. Solitary confinement is a form of imprisonment practiced worldwide, but no positive effects of the punishment have been proven (Jaapl). Nonetheless, penal confinement involving solitude has been described as having a beneficent effect on [[anthrophobes]].{{citation needed|reason=Cannot find source – Murchinson was 13 in 1900 and JGP didn't exist until 1924|date=June 2016}} &lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Murchison |first1=Carl |title=The Journal of Genetic Psychology |date=1900 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

== Use ==
The practice is used when a prisoner is considered dangerous to themselves or to others, is suspected of organizing or being engaged in illegal activities outside of the prison, or, as in the case of a prisoner such as a [[pedophilia|pedophile]] or [[witness]], is at a high risk of being harmed by another inmate or inmates. The latter example is a form of [[protective custody]]. Solitary confinement is also the norm in [[supermax prison]]s where prisoners who are deemed dangerous or of high risk are held. It may be hard to determine the number of people currently being held in solitary confinement because some prisons have a hard time defining it. However, it is estimated that 80,000 to 100,000 people are currently in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Effects and access to care ===
The effects of solitary confinement on juveniles can be highly detrimental to their growth. The isolation of solitary confinement can cause anguish, provoke serious mental and physical health problems, and work against rehabilitation for juveniles.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kysel |first=Ian |title=Growing Up Locked Down: Youth in Solitary Confinement in Jails and Prisons in the United States |date=October 2012 |journal=&lt;!--Joint report by ACLU/HRW--&gt; |publisher=[[ACLU]] &amp; [[Human Rights Watch]] |location=U.S. |isbn=1-56432-949-6 |format=PDF |url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/us1012ForUpload.pdf |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77}} Because young people are still developing, traumatic experiences like solitary confinement may have a profound effect on their chance to rehabilitate and grow.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;  Solitary confinement can worsen both short- and long-term psychological and physical problems or make it more likely that such problems will develop.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|22}} The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Human Rights Watch]] created a report that incorporated the testimony of some juvenile inmates. Many interviews described how their placement in solitary confinement exacerbated the stresses of being in jail or prison. Many spoke of harming themselves with staples or razors, having hallucinations, losing touch with reality, and having thoughts of or attempting suicide – all this while having very limited access to health care.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|29–35}}

Juveniles in solitary confinement are routinely denied access to treatment, services, and programming required to meet their medical, psychological, developmental, social, and rehabilitative needs.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|3,92}}  The ACLU and the Human Rights Watch have made recommendations at both a State and Federal level regarding their lack of access to medical services etc.

As well as severe and damaging psychological effects, solitary confinement manifests physiologically as well. Solitary confinement has been reported to cause [[hypertension]], [[headaches]] and [[migraines]], profuse sweating, [[dizziness]], and [[heart palpitations]]. Many inmates also experience extreme weight loss due to digestion complications and abdominal pain. Many of these symptoms are due to the intense anxiety and sensory deprivation. Inmates can also experience neck and back pain and muscle stiffness due to long periods of little to no physical activity. These symptoms often worsen with repeated visit to solitary confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy Corcoran|first1=Mary|title=Effects of Solitary Confinement on the Well Being of Prison Inmates|url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/opus/issues/2015/spring/corcoran|website=NYU Steinhardt Department of Applied Psychology|publisher=NYU Steinhardt|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legality ===
The [[UN Special Rapporteur]] on Torture and other UN bodies have stated that the solitary confinement (physical and social isolation of 22–24 hours per day for 1 day or more) of young people under age 18, for any duration, constitutes cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|76}}

==== Human rights ====
In the UK, the state has a duty to “set the highest standards of care” when it limits the liberties of children.&lt;ref name=alex2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crook |first=Frances |title=Where Is Child Protection in Penal Custody? |date=September 2006 |journal=Criminal Behavior &amp; Mental Health |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=137–141 |doi=10.1002/cbm.627 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbm.627/abstract |subscription=yes |access-date=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many believe, Frances Crook included, that incarceration and solitary confinement are the harshest forms of possible punishments and “should only be taken as a last resort.” &lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt; Additionally, because children are still mentally developing, incarceration should not encourage them to commit more violent crimes.&lt;ref name= alex2 /&gt;

==== Effects ====
The [[penal system]] has been cited as failing to protect juveniles in custody.&lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt; In the UK, “twenty-nine children have died in penal custody in 1990. Some 41% of the children in custody were officially designated as being vulnerable.”&lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt; This is attributed to the fact that isolation and physical restraint are being used as the first response to punish them for simple rule infractions.&lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt; Moreover, Frances Crook argues that these punitive policies not only violate their basic rights, but also leave the children mentally unstable and left with illnesses that are often ignored.&lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt; Overall, the solitary confinement of youth is considered to be counterproductive because the “restrictive environment…and intense regulation of children” aggravates them, instead of addressing the issue of rehabilitation.&lt;ref name=alex2 /&gt;

== United States{{anchor|Solitary_confinement_in_the_United_States}} ==

===History in the United States===
The [[penal system]] in the United States developed under two separate systems known as the [[Auburn system]] and [[Separate system|Pennsylvania system]].&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; The current system of solitary confinement was derived originally from the Pennsylvania model which was characterized by "isolation and seclusion." &lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Evidence has shown that [[Quakers]] and [[Calvinists]] supported solitary confinement as an alternative form of punishment. At the time it was meant to provide a prisoner with solitude “to reflect on his misdeeds” and restore his relationship with God.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griest|first=Stephanie Elizondo|title=The Torture of Solitary Confinement|url=http://wilsonquarterly.com/quarterly/spring-2012-the-age-of-connection/the-torture-of-solitary/|date=Spring 2012|journal=[[The Wilson Quarterly]]|volume=36|issue=2|pages=22–29|access-date=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solitary confinement was intended as an alternative to public floggings which were common at the time. In 1818, New York reformer and Friend, [[Thomas Eddy]], lobbied for [[Penal labour|inmate labor]] and solitary confinement in place of other forms of punishment such as [[hanging]]. Shortly after, New York decided to include solitary confinement and inmate labor into their penal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Graber|title='When Friends Had the Management It Was Entirely Different': Quakers and Calvinists in the Making of New York Prison Discipline|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/254531|journal=Quaker History|date=Fall 2008|volume=97|number=2|pages=19–40|doi=10.1353/qkh.0.0011|subscription=yes|access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|US Federal Prison system]], solitary confinement is known as the Special Housing Unit (SHU),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/mcr/MCR_visit_hours.pdf Institution Supplement – Visiting Regulations, USP McCreary] (from the Bureau of Prisons, US Department of Justice website. Retrieved 1 May 2008.)&lt;/ref&gt; pronounced like "shoe" ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|uː}}). California's prison system also uses the abbreviation SHU, but it stands for Security Housing Units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Facilities_Locator/COR.html Visitors, State Prison, Corcoran (CSP-COR)], from the [[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]] website. (Retrieved 12 June 2016.)&lt;/ref&gt; In other states, it is known as the Special Management Unit (SMU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solitarywatch.com/2011/05/22/voices-from-solitary-an-insane-asylum-disguised-as-an-smu/ |title=Voices from Solitary: An Insane Asylum Disguised As an SMU |publisher=[[Solitary Watch]] |date=22 May 2011 |first1=James|last1=Ridgeway |first2=Jean|last2=Casella}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Current estimates of the number of inmates held in solitary confinement are difficult to determine, though generally the minimum held at any given time has been determined to be 20,000, with estimates as high as 80,000.&lt;ref name="naday"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naday|first1=Alexandra|last2=Freilich|first2=Joshua|last3=Mellow|first3=Jeff|title=The Elusive Data on Supermax Confinement|url=http://tpj.sagepub.com/content/88/1/69|journal=[[The Prison Journal]]|volume=88|number=1|date=March 2008|pages=69–93|doi=10.1177/0032885507310978|access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Juveniles ===
Juveniles are held in solitary confinement in jails and prisons across the United States, often for days, weeks, months, or even years in order to punish, protect, house, or treat some of the youth held there.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|2}} There is significant controversy surrounding the use of solitary confinement in cases of juveniles.

===Troubled Teen Industry===
The Troubled Teen Industry is a loosely connected series of for-profit [[wilderness therapy]] programs, boot camps, [[therapeutic boarding schools]], and [[residential treatment centers]].  These facilities house youth after parents sign away custody of their children.  These children can be sent to these facilities for any reason, without committing a crime, without a trial, and without legal representation.  Solitary confinement is used widely in these programs, including wilderness programs, where children are left alone for weeks in the wilderness.  Some programs place children in solitary rooms.  Other times, "code silence," or "comm block," is used, which means that the child is not allowed to speak, and the other inmates must ignore them and pretend they do not exist.  This practice was documented at [[Island View Residential Treatment Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://testkitchen.huffingtonpost.com/island-view/|title=The Troubled-Teen Industry Has Been A Disaster For Decades. It's Still Not Fixed.|website=The Troubled-Teen Industry Has Been A Disaster For Decades. And It's Still Not Fixed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychiatric hospitals===
Patients in psychiatric hospitals are often put into solitary confinement, usually for 24 hours at a time, when staff members determine that they are a danger to themselves or others.

===Federal prisons ===
The use of SHUs within the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] is regulated under {{CodeFedReg|28|541}}. When placed in the SHU, prisoners are either in "administrative detention status", a non-punitive status which removes prisoners from the general population when necessary to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of correctional facilities, or protect the public, or "disciplinary segregation status", a punitive status imposed only by a Discipline Hearing Officer (DHO) as a sanction for committing prohibited acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscfr|28|541|22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 100 prohibited acts, all of which may result in solitary confinement, including unauthorized physical contact such as kissing, using abusive or obscene language, feigning illness, [[Right to petition in the United States|circulating a petition]], insolence towards a staff member, engaging in or encouraging a group [[demonstration (protest)|demonstration or protest]], and participating in or encouraging a [[strike action|labor strike]] (also known as a [[prison strike]]), gang activity, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscfr|28|541|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State prisons and municipal jails ===
Woodbourne Correctional Facility houses the inmate in with the most time spent in New York state's solitary confinement units.{{Clarify|date=January 2018}} Inmate [[Willie Bosket]], now suffering mental and health problems, was confined in [[Woodbourne Correctional Facility]]. He has been in SHU for over 20 years after violent incidents directed at prison staff. Allowed no physical contact with humans, he is watched on camera at all times, takes showers in his cell (the water turns on for 10 minutes every two days) and is fed through a metal slot. He is currently serving a sentence of 82 years to [[Life imprisonment|life]] at [[Five Points Correctional Facility]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Luis Rosado, known as 'Blue Boy', is another prisoner with a violent history facing indefinite solitary confinement in New York State's Correctional system.

Solitary confinement is becoming more and more popular throughout the U.S. with some "supermax" prisons have nothing but solitary confinement cells. "Some people are held in solitary confinement in special "supermax" prisons, such as California's Pelican Bay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5584254|title=At Pelican Bay Prison, a Life in Solitary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia's Red Onion, and the federal government's ADX in Florence, Colorado. At least 44 states&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urban.org/uploadedPDF/411326_supermax_prisons.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the federal system now have supermax prisons, which are generally composed solely of solitary confinement cells. Other prisoners live in SHUs, RHUs, and IMUs within ordinary prisons, and even inside local jails."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== California ====
When California opened its first "adjustment center", the goal was to return prisoners to the mainline prison population and ultimately to a society through an enrichment program of psychological and social services.&lt;ref name="Regulating Prisons of the Future"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haney|first1=Craig |last2=Lynch|first2=Mona |title=Regulating Prisons of the Future: A Psychological Analysis of Supermax and Solitary Confinement |journal=[[New York University School of Law|NYU]] Rev. Law &amp; Social Change |year=1997 |volume=23 |pages=478–558 |url=http://www.probono.net/prisoners/stopsol-reports/416694.Regulating_Prisons_of_the_Future |access-date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the plan was never executed. In 1983, [[George Deukmejian]] was elected as the California governor and during his time, he formed what was then the state's newest prison – a massive, windowless “security housing unit” (SHU). SHU was intended to segregate over a thousand prisoners from the rest of the prison system through isolation. Deukmejian boasted that the [[Pelican Bay State Prison]] was a "state-of-the-art prison that will serve as a model for the rest of the nation...".&lt;ref name="Regulating Prisons of the Future" /&gt;

The prisoners are kept confined to their cells almost twenty-three hours a day and all forms of human contact through refined locking and monitoring systems are minimized. Pelican Bay SHU was one of the first visible “super-maximum security” facilities and thus it attracted lots of media attention.&lt;ref name="Regulating Prisons of the Future" /&gt; Those opposing the conditions of California's “supermax” resulted in the federal court criticizing certain features of the prison but left the basic regimen of segregation and isolation largely intact.&lt;ref name="Regulating Prisons of the Future" /&gt;

One of the policies of supermax confinement among other policies is designed to increase punishment by removing gang members from the mainline population and subject them to solitary confinement, whether it is for a set amount of time or an indefinite duration. In a recent study, it noted that the California Department of corrections has implemented ways to fix their alleged gang problem, such as using ‘confidential informants,’ segregating gang members, intercepting gang communications, setting up task forces to monitor and track gang members, locking up gang leaders in high security prisons, and ‘locking down’ entire institutions.&lt;ref name="Regulating Prisons of the Future" /&gt;

These facilities, supermax prisons, were originally designed to contain and control the worst criminals and those who did not adhere to the rules of prisons, AKA "the worst of the worst".&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; As of 2001, the count of inmates in administrative segregation in California was 5,982 representing an 80.2% change over time, but this number is not quite correct due to deficient files provided.&lt;ref name="naday" /&gt; Increasingly, the practice of using solitary confinement long term, instead of the intended three-month period, in the supermax prisons as inmate management has become the norm.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; The selected inmates, who wear jumpsuits that differentiate them from the general population, will spend around 23 hours a day alone in a cell where they are offered very little and fully monitored as is procedure at [[Pelican Bay State Prison]] which is one of the largest supermax prisons in the United States.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; In order to be sent to Pelican Bay, the inmate has either committed murder, assault, riots, threatening staff or fellow inmates, and even gang affiliation which must be validated by the prison staff.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt;

There are 22 SHU units of Pelican Bay which include 132 eight-cell pods that are lit by heavy Plexiglass skylights enclosed by steel cell doors.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; The inmates are provided with a concrete slab as a bed, a toilet, small shelf, and a concrete stool with no windows in an 80 sq. foot space.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; SHU inmates are allotted for an hour and a half of exercise every day where they are taken to a 26 by 20 foot area surrounded by 20 foot high cement walls.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; Only one prisoner from each pod can move at a time and will be placed in waist restraints for any medical/dental appointments to assist in the examination process and may also have leg restraints placed on them before they are able to leave the unit depending on the purpose of the appointment.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt;

In [[San Quentin State Prison]], the violence rates were still high in the 1980s despite the similar lockdowns and procedures of Pelican Bay because these prisoners use the small windows out of lockdown to either harm themselves or others.&lt;ref name="kupers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kupers |first=Terry A. |title=What To Do With the Survivors? Coping With the Long-Term Effects of Isolated Confinement |journal=[[Criminal Justice and Behavior]] |volume=35 |number=8 |date=August 2008 |pages=1005–1016 |doi=10.1177/0093854808318591 |url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/35/8/1005 |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They typically will try not to harm themselves while in the psychiatric hospital ward either, but they will plan out while in lockdown until they can see their plan through.&lt;ref name="kupers" /&gt; However even as they near their release dates, they are moved to “prerelease programs” out of the SHU which are successful with some prisoners, but it causes most others to become even more uncontrollable and unpredictable due to their mental states that aren’t properly cared for or screened.&lt;ref name="kupers" /&gt;

In May 2012, California's prison system faced a lawsuit from the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] and a group of California attorneys for the use of long terms of solitary confinement, some lasting for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Devereaux|first=Ryan |title=Prisoners challenge legality of solitary confinement lasting more than a decade |url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/may/31/california-prison-lawsuit-solitary-confinement |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=31 May 2012 |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, easing some conditions for inmates in near-solitary confinement in California prisons has died in the state legislature. The bill was among others supposed to reform Security Housing Units rules to allow the inmates to keep photographs and make a phone call after three months of good behavior was listed as inactive on Friday after a decision on Thursday evening by state Senator Loni Hancock to drop it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bernstein|first=Sharon |title=Bill to reform California's near-solitary prison units dies |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/30/us-usa-california-prisons-idUSKBN0GU01D20140830 |date=30 August 2014 |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Maryland ====

In 2012, a report was conducted by the [[Vera Institute of Justice]] revealed that Maryland's use of restricted housing was twice the national average (8.5% versus an average of 4%).&lt;ref&gt;[https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/interfaithaction/pages/13/attachments/original/1412026936/VERA_study_-_Review_of_MD_Use_of_Segregation_in_Adult_Prisons.pdf?1412026936 Vera Report]&lt;/ref&gt;  Legislation was introduced in &lt;ref name="2014 bill"&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-03-31/news/bs-ed-solitary-confinement-20140330_1_solitary-confinement-discipline-inmates-prisoners 2014 bill]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

According to a psychiatrist, Dr. Annette Hanson's article,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shrink-rap-today/201108/solitary-confinement-rumor-and-reality&lt;/ref&gt;  who works with Maryland's Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS), prolonged segregation does not provide deleterious effects on inmates. DPSCS also asserted that solitary confinement doesn't exist in their institutions.&lt;ref name="2014 bill"/&gt;

==== New York ====
Since the 1980s, the [[New York City Department of Correction]] has increased the use of segregation as a discipline and management tool. In effect, segregation is a secondary sentence imposed by the correctional facility, which is usually unrelated to the conviction for which the person is incarcerated.&lt;ref name="browne2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Browne|first1=Angela |last2=Cambier|first2=Alissa |last3=Agha|first3=Suzanne |title=Prisons Within Prisons: The Use of Segregation in the United States |journal=[[Federal Sentencing Reporter]] |volume=24 |issue=1 |date=October 2011 &lt;!--Sentencing Within Sentencing--&gt; |pages=46–49 |doi=10.1525/fsr.2011.24.1.46 |url=http://www.vera.org/pubs/prisons-within-prisons-segregation |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are high rates of use of solitary confinement in [[New York (state)|New York]] when compared to other U.S. states.  Within the New York prison system, solitary confinement is frequently imposed for nonviolent, “trivial prisoner offenses.” Usually the common misconception is that solitary confinement is a punishment of last resort, reserved for inmates who present a threat of violence or escape.&lt;ref name=casella&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Casella|first1=Jean |last2=Ridgeway|first2=James |title=New York's Black Sites |date=11 July 2012 |journal=[[The Nation]] |volume=295 |issue=5 |pages=18–24 |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/new-yorks-black-sites/ |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inmates that are released from solitary confinement go through a “transitional unit” but failure in the program results in their return to solitary confinement.  Overall, most of the inmates fail and return to solitary confinement.&lt;ref name="okeefe2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Keefe |first=Maureen L. |title=Administrative Segregation from within: A Corrections Perspective |journal=[[The Prison Journal]] |volume=88 |issue=1 |date=March 2008 |pages=123–143 |doi=10.1177/0032885507310999 |url=http://tpj.sagepub.com/content/88/1/123.abstract |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York has the highest rate of “disciplinary segregation” in the country, making solitary confinement a regular every day action among the prison. Although prisons nationwide have decreased use of solitary confinement, the [[New York City Department of Correction]] expanded its capacity by 27 percent in 2011 and another 44 percent in 2012, according to the NYC Jails Action Coalition. Although the DOC housed 1,000 more inmates in 1990 than it does today, its jails have more solitary cells now. Due to this the city is topping the charts of municipalities with a high rate of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=bartlett /&gt; On any given day, there are about 4,500 men, women, and children in some form of isolated confinement in New York State prisons. This is not including New York City's jails, which are run under a separate system, where those in solitary confinement reach close to 1,000 or more.&lt;ref name="casella"/&gt;

A new bill was introduced by Councilman [[Danny Dromm]] would require the [[Department of Correction]] to post a monthly report on its website about punitive segregation. It would also require data on the number of people in punitive segregation, the length of time in this setting, the nature of the infractions, age, mental health, if they were prescribed medication or moved to a hospital, violence against others and inmate requests.&lt;ref name=bartlett /&gt; Many are supportive of this bill with the goal being to make jail facilities safer for inmates and correction officers.Individuals who are released and experience solitary confinement go back into their communities and reoffend at higher rates than general population prisoners causing them to land back into prison.  Policy changes that will reduce the use and long-term impact of segregation will benefit not only the staff and prisoners in these units but also ultimately the well-being of facilities, systems, and the community.&lt;ref name="browne2011"/&gt;  Councilman Dromm also issued a separate resolution seeking to end the practice of the time owed. For example, an inmate, because of good behavior or other reasons, might only have served 100 of his or her 180-day sentence in solitary and then was released. A few years or even decades later the person is rearrested. Under current rules he or she must complete those unserved 80 days in solitary. This resolution however is only a request since the Council does not have the authority to make the [[Department of Correction]] adhere.&lt;ref name=bartlett&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bartlett |first=Josey  |title=Bill aims to reduce solitary confinement |url=http://www.qchron.com/editions/queenswide/bill-aims-to-reduce-solitary-confinement/article_45a63073-4949-51ee-a404-72d7816288c0.html |date=25 April 2013 |work=Queens Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== New York City: Rikers Island =====
The [[New York City Department of Correction]]s reported that in fiscal year 2012 more than 14.4 percent of all adolescents detained at [[Rikers Island]] between the ages of 16 and 18 were held in at least one period of solitary confinement while detained.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|131–132}} The average length of time young people spent in solitary confinement at Rikers Island was 43 days. More than 48 percent of adolescents at this institution have diagnosed mental health problems.&lt;ref name="aclu2012"/&gt;{{rp|132}} As violence associated with the [[crack epidemic]] became increasingly common, new measures were taken. The Red ID card system, instituted in the early 1990s, was a way of identifying inmates with histories of inciting riots, cuttings, stabbings, and other dangerous behaviors. It almost always meant the convict had spent time in a notorious ward designated for punitive confinement called "The Bing" (HDM 5 Block). Prisoners  Pavle Stanimirović, James Rosado, Tyrone Green, Pedro Hernandez, [[Willie Bosket]], Hector Rivera, [[Ángel Nieves Díaz|Ángel Díaz]], John Maldonado and Dominick Pollatti all spent time in "The Bing."

The New York City Department of Correction ended punitive segregation for adolescents in December 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/566-14/de-blasio-administration-ends-use-punitive-segregation-adolescent-inmates-rikers-island#/0|title=De Blasio Administration Ends Use of Punitive Segregation for Adolescent Inmates on Rikers Island|date=17 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ended punitive segregation for young adults, 18 to 21, in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2016/10/officially-ponte-says-rikers-solitary-confinement-banned-for-young-adults-106128|title=Ponte says solitary confinement of young inmates now officially banned at Rikers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly due to the case of [[Kalief Browder]].

==Europe==
The [[European Court of Human Rights]] has three labels for solitary confinement: [[complete sensory isolation]], [[total social isolation]] and [[relative social isolation]].&lt;ref name="Verdictp3"&gt;{{cite report |title=Oslo District Court declaratory judgement for breach of the ECHR art. 3 &amp; 8; Anders Behring Breivik plaintiff |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/f/domisakenomsoningsforhold15107496tviotirabbstaten.pdf |date=20 April 2016 |format=PDF |access-date=25 April 2016 |page=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429020641/http://www.dagbladet.no/f/domisakenomsoningsforhold15107496tviotirabbstaten.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]], or CPT, defines solitary confinement as "whenever a prisoner is ordered to be held separately from other prisoners, for example, as a result of court decision, as a disciplinary sanction imposed within the prison system, as a preventative administrative measure or for the protection of the prisoner concerned".&lt;ref name="Verdictp3"/&gt;

In [[Italy]], a person sentenced to more than one life sentence is required to serve a period of between 6 months to 3 years in solitary confinement.

=== United Kingdom ===
Solitary confinement as a disciplinary measure for prisoners in Europe was largely reduced or eliminated during the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="gawande9"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gawande|first=Atul |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/03/30/090330fa_fact_gawande |title=Is long-term solitary confinement torture?|work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, only 40 out of 75,000 inmates held in [[England and Wales]] were placed in solitary confinement cells.&lt;ref name="tapley10"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tapley|first=Lance |title=The Worst of the Worst: Supermax Torture in America |date=1 November 2010 |url=http://www.bostonreview.net/tapley-supermax-torture-in-america.php |publisher=[[Boston Review]] |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secure housing units ==
Officially, the purpose of placing prisoners in secure housing units (SHUs) is to increase control over dangerous inmates. Some hope the SHU encourages prisoners to reflect on their actions. These units are characterized by extreme isolation of prisoners who "are housed in small cells with solid steel doors…for 22 to 23 hours per day."&lt;ref name=arrigo&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arrigo|first1=Bruce A. |last2=Bullock|first2=Jennifer Leslie |title=The Psychological Effects of Solitary Confinement on Prisoners in Supermax Units |date=19 November 2007 &lt;!--published online before print--&gt; |journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy &amp; Comparative Criminology |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=622–640 |doi=10.1177/0306624X07309720 |url=http://ijo.sagepub.com/content/52/6/622.abstract |subscription=yes |access-date=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inmates are also deprived of social interaction and denied access to educational or therapeutic programs and health care while being held in SHUs.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt;

=== Psychological effects ===
It has been shown that the conditions of these secure housing units have severe mental and psychological effects on prisoners.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Prisoners in SHUs are isolated for long periods of time. Instances of assault and torture against these prisoners in response to trivial things have also been cited.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Social isolation housing, can reduce environmental stimulation, and causes a feeling of loss of control over all aspects of a prisoner's daily life. These environmental stimulations include but aren't limited to hypersensitivity to stimuli, distortions and hallucinations, increased anxiety and nervousness, diminished impulse control, severe and chronic depression, appetite loss and weight loss, heart palpitations, talking to oneself, problems sleeping, nightmares, self-mutilation, difficulties with thinking, concentration, and memory, and lower levels of brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birckhead|first=Tamar|year=2015|title=Children in isolation: the solitary confinement of youth|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/wflr50&amp;div=4&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals#|journal=Law Journal Library|volume=|pages=1–80|via=George Mason University Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common justification by officials is that prisoners of certain natures deserve to be punished for the threat that they pose to society.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; This can be attributed to the fear of increasing crime rates and therefore, support the government's effort to enforce harsher forms of punishment.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt;

The most "notorious example of the extreme social isolation found in supermaximum custody units" is the SHU at [[SouthPort]] NYDOCS [[Upstate Correctional Facility]] &amp; [[Pelican Bay State Prison]].&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; From studying conditions at Pelican Bay, researchers argue that long-term social isolation "carries major psychiatric risks." &lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Prisoners are susceptible to developing mental illnesses because they are confined to coffin-like conditions and denied access to basic health services.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Illnesses range from anxiety, clinical depression, and self-mutilation to suicidal thoughts and SHU syndrome.&lt;ref name=arrigo /&gt; Yet, it is important to note that the duration of the isolation is the most important factor in determining the effects of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name= arrigo /&gt;

=== Scrutiny ===
[[Supermax prison]]s, large-scale implementations of secure housing units, employ solitary confinement to isolate predatory, disorderly inmates from the rest of the prison community.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Kate |last1=King |first2=Benjamin |last2=Steiner |first3=Stephanie R. |last3=Breach |title=Violence in the Supermax: A Self Fulfilling Prophecy |journal=[[The Prison Journal]] |volume=88 |number=1 |date=March 2008 |pages=144–68. |url=http://tpj.sagepub.com/content/88/1/144 |doi=10.1177/0032885507311000 |access-date=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal Bureau of Prisons create special supermax facilities to contain the most aggressive inmates in a protective effort.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; Kate King, professor and director of Criminal Justice at [[Murray State University]], Benjamin Steiner, professor of Criminal Justice at the [[University of Cincinnati]], and Stephanie Ritchie Breach, director of the Third District Youth Court, explain how while violence has always been a factor in prison life, the level of aggression is magnified in facilities where all such members of the prison system are concentrated.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; These scholars argue that the violent nature of supermax prisons such as [[Pelican Bay State Prison]] are perpetrated by prison culture itself.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; King, Steiner, and Breach question the effectiveness of these institutions and claim the violent reputation of American prisons stems from this departure from the treatment model.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; Supermax prisons are also scrutinized on legal and ethical bases.

=== Recidivism ===
Shira E. Gordon, a University of Michigan Law Student, argues that solitary confinement leads to an increase in [[recidivism]] and violence. To substantiate this conclusion, she cites two quantitative research based studies that support this nexus and counters those who argue that solitary confinement deters recidivism.&lt;ref name=gordon2014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Shira E.|title=Solitary Confinement, Public Safety, and Recidivism|journal=[[University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform|U. Mich. J.

== Effects ==

=== Psychiatric ===
According to a March 2014 article in ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', “Inmates in jails and prisons attempt to harm themselves in many ways, resulting in outcomes ranging from trivial to fatal.”&lt;ref name=kaba2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaba|first1=Fatos |last2=Lewis|first2=Andrea |last3=Sarah|first3=Glowa-Kollisch |last4=Hadler|first4=James |last5=Lee|first5=David |last6=Alper|first6=Howard |last7=Selling|first7=Daniel |last8=MacDonald|first8=Ross |last9=Solimo|first9=Angela &lt;!--and Amanda Parsons, Homer Venters--&gt; |title=Solitary Confinement and Risk of Self-Harm Among Jail Inmates |journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]] |volume=104 |issue=3 |date=March 2014 |pages=442–447 |url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.2013.301742 |format=PDF |access-date=18 March 2014 |display-authors=1 |doi=10.2105/ajph.2013.301742 |pmid=24521238 |pmc=3953781}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While some inmates are known to have psychiatric disorders prior to entering the prison, others develop mental disorders as a result of being placed in solitary confinement. A main issue within the prison system and solitary confinement is the high number of inmates who turn to self-harm.&lt;ref name=kaba2014/&gt; Studies have shown that the longer one stays in the prison, the more at risk he or she is to self-harm.

One study has shown that “inmates ever assigned to solitary confinement were 3.2 times as likely to commit an act of self-harm per 1000 days at some time during their incarceration as those never assigned to solitary.”&lt;ref name=kaba2014/&gt; The study has concluded that there is a direct correlation between inmates who self-harm and inmates that are punished into solitary confinement. Many of the inmates look to self-harm as a way to “avoid the rigors of solitary confinement.”&lt;ref name=kaba2014/&gt; Mental health professionals ran a series of tests that ultimately concluded that “self-harm and potentially fatal self-harm associated with solitary confinement was higher independent of mental illness status and age group.”&lt;ref name=kaba2014/&gt;

Physicians have concluded that for those inmates who enter the prison already diagnosed with a mental illness, the punishment of solitary confinement is extremely dangerous in that the inmates are more susceptible to exacerbating the symptoms.&lt;ref name=metzner2010&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Metzner|first1=Jeffrey L. |last2=Fellner|first2=Jamie |title=Solitary Confinement and Mental Illness in U.S. Prisons: A Challenge for Medical Ethics |date=March 2010 |journal=[[Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|J Am Acad Psychiatry Law]] |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=104–108 |url=http://www.jaapl.org/content/38/1/104.full |access-date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional organizations, like the [[National Commission on Correctional Health Care]] (NCCHC), the [[Society of Correctional Physicians|American College of Correctional Physicians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Society of Correctional Physicians Calls for Caution Placing Mentally Ill in Segregation An Important Band-Aid|url = http://jcx.sagepub.com/content/20/2/92|journal = Journal of Correctional Health Care|date = 1 April 2014|issn = 1078-3458|pmid = 24659757|pages = 92–94|volume = 20|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/1078345814522959|first = Marc F.|last = Stern}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA), work to improve the mental health services, however, the systems within the prisons "remain woefully inadequate."&lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt;  "Psychological effects can include anxiety, depression, anger, cognitive disturbances, perceptual distortions, obsessive thoughts, paranoia, and psychosis."&lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt; These studies suggest that a main issue with isolating prisoners who are known to have mental illnesses is that it prevents the inmates from ever possibly recovering. Instead, many "mentally ill prisoners decompensate in isolation, requiring crisis care or psychiatric hospitalization." It is also noted that if a prisoner is restrained from interacting with the individuals they wish to have contact with they exhibit similar effects.&lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt;

Suicide is often seen as a means to escape from solitary confinement, especially amongst those who deal with deeper mental illnesses like depression. Depression is one of the most common reasons why inmates often kill themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/what-does-solitary-confinement-do-to-your-mind/|title=What Does Solitary Confinement Do To Your Mind?|work=FRONTLINE|access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solitary confinement has been said to increase symptoms of those with mental health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/05/solitary.aspx|title=Alone, in 'the hole'|work=apa.org|access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Environment is a factor ====
"Prisoner mental health is becoming increasingly important," and has caught the attention of the [[World Health Organization]], which aims to reduce the "effects of imprisonment on mental health."  One study focused on the "prison environment rather than on individual factors."&lt;ref name=walker2013&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walker|first1=J. |last2=Illingworth|first2=C. |last3=Canning|first3=A. |last4=Garner|first4=E. |last5=Woolley|first5=J. |last6=Taylor|first6=P. |last7=Amos|first7=T. |title=Changes in Mental State Associated with Prison Environments: A Systematic Review |date=18 November 2013 &lt;!--Epub--&gt; |journal=[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] |volume=129 |issue=6 |pages=427–36 |doi=10.1111/acps.12221 |display-authors=1 |pmid=24237622}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study tested two time periods, short-term and long-term, that evaluated the "mental state changes in response to changes in the environment or prison setting."&lt;ref name=walker2013/&gt; It ultimately concluded that solitary confinement was "associated with negative effects on mental health."&lt;ref name=walker2013/&gt; Segregation, though similar to solitary confinement, could not be proven to have lasting negative effects on inmates, although those who were segregated had worse mental health than those who were not segregated. The study also concluded that crowding had its own problems, as "increased levels of social density had negative effects on the mental health of inmates."&lt;ref name=walker2013/&gt;

===Social===
Some sociologists argue that prisons create a unique social environment that do not allow inmates to create strong social ties outside or inside of prison life. Men are more likely to become frustrated, and therefore more mentally unstable when keeping up with family outside of prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lindquist|first=Christine H. |title=Social Integration and Mental Well-Being Among Jail Inmates |journal=Sociological Forum |volume=15|issue=3 |date=September 2000 |pages=431–455 |doi=10.1023/A:1007524426382 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1007524426382 |subscription=yes |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme forms of solitary confinement and isolation can affect the larger society as a whole. The resocialization of newly released inmates who spent an unreasonable amount of time in solitary confinement and thus suffer from serious mental illnesses is a huge dilemma for society to face.&lt;ref name="kupers" /&gt; The effects of isolation unfortunately do not stop once the inmate has been released. After release from segregated housing, psychological effects have the ability to sabotage a prisoner's potential to successfully return to the community and adjust back to ‘normal’ life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/health/solitary-confinement-mental-illness.html|title=Solitary Confinement: Punished for Life|last=Goode|first=Erica|date=3 August 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inmates are often startled easily, and avoid crowds and public places. They seek out confined small spaces because the public areas overwhelm their sensory stimulation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Criticism==

===Ineffectiveness===
In 2002, the Commission on Safety and Abuse in America, chaired by [[John Joseph Gibbons]] and [[Nicholas Katzenbach]] found that: "The increasing use of high-security segregation is counter-productive, often causing violence inside facilities and contributing to recidivism after release."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vera.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/Confronting_Confinement.pdf |title=Confronting Confinement: A Report of The Commission on Safety and Abuse in America's Prisons |date=8 June 2006 |authors=John J.

Solitary confinement has been traditionally used as a behavioral reform of isolating prisoners physically, emotionally and mentally in order to control and change inmate behavior. Recently arrived inmates are more likely to violate prison rules than their inmate counterparts and thus are more likely to be put in solitary confinement. Additionally, individual attributes and environmental factors combine to increase an inmate's likelihood of being put into solitary confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Kenneth|title=Adjusting to Prison Life|journal=Crime and Justice|volume=16|pages=275|doi=10.1086/449208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture===
{{POV section|date=June 2016|talk=Torture_NPOV}}
Solitary confinement is considered to be a form of [[psychological torture]] with measurable long-term physiological effects when the period of confinement is longer than a few weeks or is continued indefinitely.

The documented psychological effects led one judge in a 2001 suit to rule that "Solitary confinement units are virtual incubators of psychoses—seeding illness in otherwise healthy inmates and exacerbating illness in those already suffering from mental infirmities."&lt;ref&gt;''Ruiz v. Johnson'', 154 F.Supp.2d 975 (S.D.Tex.2001)&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, as of 2016, there have been thirty-five U.S. Supreme Court cases petitioning solitary confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://solitarywatch.com/resources/u-s-supreme-court-cases/|title=U.S. Supreme Court Cases|date=11 December 2010|newspaper=Solitary Watch|language=en-US|access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, UN Special Rapporteur on torture, Juan E. Méndez, told the General Assembly's third committee, which deals with social, humanitarian, and cultural affairs, that the practice could amount to torture.&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40097|title=UN News - Solitary confinement should be banned in most cases, UN expert says|first=United Nations News Service|last=Section|date=18 October 2011|website=UN News Service Section}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Considering the severe mental pain or suffering solitary confinement may cause, it can amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment when used as a punishment, during pre-trial detention, indefinitely or for a prolonged period, for persons with mental disabilities or juveniles,” he warned.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

In November 2014. the United Nations Committee Against Torture noted that full isolation for 22–23 hours a day in super-maximum security prisons is unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CAT/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CAT_COC_USA_18893_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations have also banned the use of solitary confinement for longer than 15 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author1=Ramin Skibba |url=https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/society/2018/hidden-damage-solitary-confinement | title=The hidden damage of solitary confinement |date= June 22, 2018 |magazine=[[Knowable Magazine]]|doi=10.1146/knowable-062118-065101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misuse===
Misuse of solitary confinement has been widely controversial. In immigration detention centers, reports have surfaced concerning its use against detainees in order to keep those knowledgeable about their [[Human rights|rights]] away from other detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Homer|last1=Venters |first2=Dana|last2=Dasch-Goldberg |first3=Andrew|last3=Rasmussen |first4=Allen S.|last4=Keller |title=Into the Abyss: Mortality and Morbidity Among Detained Immigrants |journal=[[Human Rights Quarterly]] |date=May 2009 |volume=31|number=2|pages=474–495 |doi=10.1353/hrq.0.0074 |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/265311 |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[prison-industrial complex]] itself, reports of solitary confinement as punishment in work labor prisons have also summoned much criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chang|first1=Tracy F.

===Access to healthcare===
Research has shown that the routine features of prison can make huge demands on limited coping resources. After prison many ex-convicts with mental illness do not receive adequate treatment for their mental health issues, because health services turn them away. This is caused by restrictive policies or lack of resources for treating the formerly incarcerated individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Primm|first1=Annelle B. |last2=Osher|first2=Fred C. |last3=Gomez|first3=Marisela B. |title=Race and Ethnicity, Mental Health Services and Cultural Competence in the Criminal Justice System: Are we Ready to Change? |journal=Community Mental Health Journal |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=557–569 |doi=10.1007/s10597-005-6361-3 |pmid=16142538 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study focusing on women and adolescent men, those who had health insurance, received mental health services, or had a job were less likely to return to jail.

Treating mentally ill patients by sentencing them into solitary confinement has captured the attention of human rights experts who conclude that “solitary confinement may amount to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment” that violates rights specifically targeting cruel, inhuman treatment.&lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt; Health care professionals and organizations recognize the fact that solitary confinement is not ethical, yet the segregating treatment fails to come to a halt.&lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt; “Experience demonstrates that prisons can operate safely and securely without putting inmates with mental illness in typical conditions of segregation.” &lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt; Despite this and medical professionals’ obligations, segregation policies have not changed because mental health clinics believe that “isolation is necessary for security reasons.” &lt;ref name=metzner2010/&gt; In fact, many believe that it is ethical for physicians to help those in confinement but that the physicians should also be trying to stop the abuse. If they cannot do so they are expected to undertake public advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metzner|first=Jeffrey L.|last2=Fellner|first2=Jamie|date=1 March 2010|title=Solitary Confinement and Mental Illness in U.S. Prisons: A Challengefor Medical Ethics|url=http://www.jaapl.org/content/38/1/104|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law Online|language=en|volume=38|issue=1|pages=104–108|issn=1093-6793|pmid=20305083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==

The legality of solitary confinement has been frequently challenged over the past sixty years as conceptions surrounding the practice have changed.  Much of the legal discussion concerning solitary confinement has centered on whether or not it constitutes torture or cruel and unusual punishment. While [[international law]] has generally begun to discourage solitary confinement's use in penal institutions,&lt;ref name=conley2013&gt;{{cite journal |last=Conley |first=Anna |title=Torture in US Jails and Prisons: An Analysis of Solitary Confinement Under International Law |date=April 2013 |journal=Vienna J. on Int'l Const. Law |volume=7 |pages=415–453 |url=http://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/vioincl7&amp;section=52 |accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; opponents of solitary confinement have been less successful at challenging it within the [[United States legal system]].

===International law===

Throughout the twentieth century, the [[United Nations]]' stance on solitary confinement has become increasingly oppositional. International law has reflected this change, and UN monitoring has led to a major reduction of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

In 1949, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].  Although the Declaration is non-binding, the basic human rights outlined within it have served as the foundation of [[customary international law]].&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  The relevance of the Declaration to solitary confinement is found in Article 5, which states that “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a5 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights] (UN.org)&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, if solitary confinement is believed to constitute torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, then the country practicing solitary confinement is violating the provisions set by the UDHR.

The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), effective 1976, reiterates the fifth article of the UDHR; Article 7 of the ICCPR identically states, “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx|title=OHCHR - International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|work=ohchr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ICCPR is a legally binding agreement, any nation that is signatory to the covenant would be violating international law if it practiced torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.

At the time that the UDHR and ICCPR were adopted, solitary confinement was not yet believed to constitute torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt; Its practice, therefore, was not believed to violate international law. This changed, however, after the UN definition of torture was outlined in detail in the 1984 [[Convention Against Torture]] (CAT); Article 1.1 of the CAT states that torture is "any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person" for any reason such as obtaining information or punishment, and Article 16 of the same convention prohibits "other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment". Based on these provisions, many members of the UN began to believe that solitary confinement's detrimental psychological effects could, indeed, constitute cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, if not, torture.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt; In the years following the CAT, UN representatives "have publicly decried the use of solitary confinement as a violation of the CAT and ICCPR," as well as the UDHR.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

In more recent years, UN representatives have strengthened their efforts to stop solitary confinement from being used worldwide.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt; The urgency with which representatives have undertaken these efforts is largely due to the [[United Nations Special Rapporteurs|UN Special Rapporteurs]] on Torture, [[Manfred Nowak]] and [[Juan E. Méndez|Juan Méndez]].&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt; Nowak and Méndez have both "repeatedly unequivocally stated that prolonged solitary confinement is cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and may amount to torture".&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  Nowak and Méndez have been especially critical of long-term or prolonged solitary confinement, which they define as lasting fifteen days or more.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt; Their authority and explicit characterization of solitary confinement as cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment has led the UN to include long-term to indefinite solitary confinement in the group of practices that violate the provisions outlined in the UDHR, ICCPR, and CAT. Solitary confinement lasting for a short period of time, however, is allowed under international law when used as a last resort, though Nowak, Mendez, and many other UN representatives believe that the practice should be abolished altogether.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

=== United States law ===
In the U.S., opponents of solitary confinement have argued (with varying success) that the practice violates prisoners’ [[Constitutional right#United States|Constitutional rights]]. Despite the long history of litigation over the practice, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has yet to definitively state whether or not solitary confinement is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of long-term solitary confinement only once in the ‘‘[[Wilkinson v. Austin]]'’ case. In contrast to the Supreme Court's inaction, lower courts of the U.S. have imposed constitutional limitations on the use of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt; Despite such limitations, the federal courts have refused to find that solitary confinement is per se unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt; The U.S. has also effectively “insulated itself from any official sanction for international violations by not submitting to the jurisdiction” of committees that enforce the ICCPR or CAT.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

====Eighth Amendment====

Since solitary confinement has been designated as “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” under international law, many lawyers have argued that it is also the kind of “cruel and unusual punishments” prohibited by the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]. Proving this to be the case, however, has been a difficult task for attorneys at every level of the court system.

In light of the serious, long-lasting psychological effects solitary confinement can have, inmates have argued that the mental injuries they suffer qualify as “cruel and unusual punishment.” Prison officials contend that placing inmates in prolonged solitary confinement is necessary for various reasons.  Some of these reasons include separating violent prisoners from the general population, separating vulnerable inmates (such as juveniles) from others, and punishing those prisoners who attempt to cause riots or try to escape.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt; Prisoners argue, however, that the nature of these kinds of offenses does not justify the use of solitary confinement; in their eyes “there is simply no strong security need for the total social isolation that exists at some supermax prisons”.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;

A large portion of the court cases addressing solitary confinement have approached the practice as a violation of Eighth Amendment rights. Courts have generally agreed that solitary confinement is, indeed, a violation of the Eighth Amendment for inmates with preexisting mental illness or juveniles.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt; However, the Supreme Court concluded that “while there was a risk of serious psychological injury to inmates, that risk was not of ‘sufficiently serious magnitude’ to find a ‘per se’ violation of the Eighth Amendment for ‘‘all’’ prisoners placed in long-term solitary confinement”.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;

Showing that solitary confinement constitutes cruel and unusual punishment has proven difficult for inmates and their attorneys. The Supreme Court requires ‘extreme deprivations’ in order to have merits for a ‘conditions-of-confinement claim’ and courts have also held that inmates are only protected against “certain kinds of extreme deprivations” by the Eighth Amendment.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt; In ‘‘[[Farmer v. Brennan]]’’, the Supreme Court set two requirements that must be fulfilled in order to challenge solitary confinement as “cruel and unusual”.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt; First, prisoners must show that a “substantial risk of serious harm to inmates” and second, that the prison officials were “deliberately indifferent” to such risk.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt; To prove a prison official's “deliberate indifference,” the prisoner must “show evidence that the official was ‘actually’ aware of a prisoner's serious need and chose to ignore it”.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt; Since the psychological impact of solitary confinement is not believed to be “objectively” cruel and unusual within the U.S. legal system, and because it is difficult to establish that prison officials are “indifferent” to prisoner health and safety, inmates and attorneys alleging these two requirements have faced limited success.

The [[Prison Litigation Reform Act]] (PLRA) further complicates inmates’ ability to claim that solitary confinement's psychological damage constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Section 1997e(e) of the PLRA states that {{quote|no Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cockrell|first=John F.|title=Solitary Confinement: The Law Today and the Way Forward|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/89007447/solitary-confinement-law-today-way-forward|journal=[[Law &amp; Psychology Review]]|volume=37|date=March 2013|pages=211–227|access-date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} This demonstrates that the Eighth Amendment provides “greater protection” against physical injury than against mental pain.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt;  Therefore, unless a prisoner can demonstrate physical injury as a result of solitary confinement, he or she is unable to recover damages for any “mental or emotional injury” the confinement causes.  As a result, the Eighth Amendment has not always been proven to be the most effective approach to argue against the practice of solitary confinement.

==== Due process and the Fourteenth Amendment ====
Litigating against solitary confinement on the basis of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and [[due process clause|due process]] is another less common strategy inmates have used.  The Fourteenth Amendment limits the “types of prisoners” that can be placed in solitary confinement and the time the prisoners can be confined.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;  The due process clause within the Fourteenth Amendment also regulates solitary confinement in that prisoners must be given reviews before and during their placement in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;  Court cases made on these bases do not necessarily address any “underlying problems” of solitary confinement, but they do call for increased monitoring, hearing, and reviews.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;

Inmates who are placed in solitary confinement “must be accorded meaningful periodic review to ensure that segregation [solitary confinement] is not a ‘pretext for indefinite confinement’”.&lt;ref name=lobel2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lobel|first=Jules|title=Prolonged Solitary Confinement and the Constitution|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/conlaw/articles/volume11/issue1/Lobel11U.Pa.J.Const.L.115(2009).pdf|journal=[[Journal of Constitutional Law|J. Const. Law]]|volume=11|issue=1|date=December 2008|pages=115–138|format=PDF|access-date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Jules Lobel, professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, explains, {{quote|When a prisoner is placed in a supermax, the due process requirement of meaningful periodic review requires that his or her behavior be re-evaluated at regular intervals to determine whether supermax confinement is still warranted.}} Lobel contends that the trend in U.S. supermax prisons is to not submit these reviews at all or to provide a review with a predetermined outcome to keep the prisoner in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;  If this is indeed the case, then such inmates’ due process rights are violated.

In ''[[Wilkinson v. Austin]]'', the Supreme Court held that, in addition to the due process right to meaningful review, prisoners also have a due process right to “a statement of the reasons why they were placed or retained at the supermax” so they can better understand how to behave in the future in order to be released from solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;  Lobel argues that this “implies that the officials must provide something more than a general statement that the prisoner is very dangerous”.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;  According to Lobel this is not what usually happens at supermax facilities, so the inmates’ due process rights are violated in this way as well.&lt;ref name=lobel2008/&gt;

In recent circuit court cases, courts have ruled that solitary confinement of 305 days or more constitutes an “atypical and significant hardship” that implicates due process.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;

==== Alternative litigation techniques ====
Recognizing that the amount of proof needed to show that solitary confinement violates prisoners’ rights “is simply too high to trigger constitutional protections,” attorneys have started to approach solitary confinement from a different angle.  John F. Cockrell, a recent graduate from the University of Alabama School of Law, suggests that those who challenge solitary confinement do so in context of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA).&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt;  Cockrell reasons that {{quote|When claims under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments fail, [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990#Title II|Title II]] [of the ADA] may offer an avenue to improve the provision of services to the mentally ill in prisons and solitary confinement, but ipso facto improving the conditions under which all inmates in solitary confinement live.}}

In the past few years, several internal committees and administrative bodies involved in the United States prison and legal systems have also begun to question solitary confinement's legality.  In June 2012, for example, the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|US Senate Judiciary Committee]] held its first hearing on solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  Likewise, as of 2013, the [[US Bureau of Prisons]] has announced that it will conduct its first review of how solitary confinement is used in federal prisons.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  Additionally, the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] found multiple violations of the Constitution and ADA after investigating the use of solitary confinement for mentally ill inmates in two Pennsylvania prisons.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  The [[US Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] Agency (ICE) has also revised segregation procedures for detainees.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

=== Mentally ill inmates and juveniles ===
Studies have illustrated that mentally ill inmates and juveniles are two groups more severely affected by solitary confinement than other prisoners.  As such, the [[Solitary confinement of mentally ill prisoners in the United States|solitary confinement of mentally ill inmates]] and juveniles has been upheld as cruel and unusual in both international and US courts.

The UN has “expressly prohibit[ed] solitary confinement of juveniles and individuals with mental illness”.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Convention on the Rights of the Child have played major roles in establishing the UN's position on solitary confinement of mentally ill inmates and juveniles respectively.

Within the US legal system, too, courts have held that the solitary confinement of the mentally ill is “cruel and unusual”.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  In fact, David Fathi, Director of the ACLU's [[National Prison Project]], found that “every federal court that has considered claims by severely mentally ill prisoners held in solitary confinement has found this treatment unconstitutional”.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;  These court rulings are significant in light of the fact that more than half of the prisoners currently serving jail time in the US are mentally ill according to the US Bureau of Prisons.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  Furthermore, approximately 30% or more of prisoners in solitary confinement are mentally ill.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  These rulings have the potential to dramatically change how prisons deal with mentally ill inmates, as prison officials would no longer be able to “warehouse” “difficult” prisoners if they have a preexisting mental illness.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;  It should be noted, however, that these rulings do not guarantee that the mentally ill will not be put in solitary confinement; while they are considered a vulnerable group, these prisoners still have “limited” recourse to the Eighth Amendment.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt;

One landmark case, ''Madrid v. Gomez'', challenged the conditions of the Security Housing Unit (SHU) in the [[Pelican Bay State Prison]].  The court ruled that the current conditions were not “per se violative of the Eighth Amendment” with respect to all inmates.&lt;ref name=cockrell2013/&gt;  However, in regard to SHU's isolation of the mentally ill and the conditions of their solitary confinement, the court found that the prison had violated the Eighth Amendment.  Despite it being a landmark case, the rulings of the case have yet to set a trend among cases against other prison systems because SHU's conditions were known to be more extreme and harsh than other supermax prisons.

Juveniles who are charged as adults and placed in adult prisons are usually put in [[protective custody]], and often the conditions of protective custody are similar to those of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;  Juvenile justice experts, social scientists, and national correctional standards all agree that solitary confinement is an “ineffective therapeutic tool” that is detrimental to juveniles who are still in an “uncertain, unformed state of social identity”.&lt;ref name=gordon2014/&gt;  Given that they are developing mentally and physically, some experts have suggested that “they are severely and permanently damaged by such conditions to a greater extent than adults”.&lt;ref name=conley2013/&gt;

==Actions==
The use of long-term solitary confinement, along with other grievances, has triggered organized resistance from prisoners and advocacy groups in the United States. Prisoners in California and elsewhere have launched hunger strikes, citing cruel and unusual uses of solitary confinement as a major reason. Hundreds of prisoners in the United States, acting through the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, have in 2012 filed a petition against solitary confinement at the [[United Nations]]. The petition alleges that solitary confinement constitutes torture and should be addressed by the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=White |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/california-prisons-solitary-confinement-challenged-un-petition-429116 |title=California Prisons' Solitary Confinement Challenged In UN Petition |work=[[International Business Times]] |date=23 March 2012 |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2013 California prisoner hunger strike]] saw approximately 29,000 prisoners protesting conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/09/california-prison-hunger-strike-30000_n_3567639.html |first=Kathleen |last=Miles |title=California Prison Hunger Strike: 30,000 Inmates Refuse Meals |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=9 July 2013 |language=en |access-date=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statewide hunger strike reaching 2/3 of California's prisons began with the organizing of inmates at [[Pelican Bay State Prison]]. On 11 July 2011, prisoners at Pelican Bay State Prison began a hunger strike to “protest torturous conditions in the Security Housing Unit (SHU) there”...and to advocate for procedural and policy changes like the termination of the “debriefing process” which forces prisoners “to name themselves or others as gang members as a condition of access to food or release from isolation”.&lt;ref name=lauren1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohn |first=Marjorie |title=Prisoners Strike Against Torture in California Prisons |date=July 2011 |journal=National Lawyers Guild Review |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=61–62 |url=http://marjoriecohn.com/prisoners-strike-against-torture-in-california-prisons |access-date=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 7,000 inmates throughout the California prison system stood in solidarity with these Pelican State Bay prisoners in 2011 by also refusing their food.&lt;ref name=lauren1 /&gt; Also in solidarity with the 2011 Pelican Bay prisoners on strike is the Bay Area coalition of grassroots organizations known as the [[Prisoner Hunger Strike Solidarity coalition]]. This coalition has aided the prisoners in their strike by providing a legal support force for their negotiations with the [[California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation]] (CDCR) and by creating and running a media based platform to raise support and awareness for the strikers and their demands among the general public.&lt;ref name=lauren1 /&gt;

The CDCR's failure to meet the demands of the Pelican State Bay Prison hunger strikers in 2011 resulted in the aforementioned [[2013 California prisoner hunger strike]]. Similar to the Pelican Bay State Prison hunger strike is the organizing of January 2011 in the supermax [[Ohio State Penitentiary]], where prisoners Bomani Shakur, Siddique Abdullah Hasan, Jason Robb, and Namir Abdul Mateen began a hunger strike “to protest what they call their harsh mistreatment under solitary confinement”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goodman|first1=Amy |last2=Lynd|first2=Staughton |title=Prisoners at Supermax Ohio Penitentiary Begin Hunger Strike to Protest 17+ Year Solitary Confinement |work=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=4 January 2011 |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/1/4/prisoners_at_supermax_ohio_penitentiary_begin_hunger_strike_to_protest_17_year_solitary_confinement |access-date=12 June 2016}} (Video interview w. transcript).&lt;/ref&gt; These prisoners decided to start rejecting their meals until they could be relocated from solitary confinement to [[death row]] where their treatment as prisoners would improve. Another example took place in Fall of 2010, when prisoners throughout Georgia's prison system organized a strike in opposition to violations of the US Constitution 8th amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment for minute infractions of rules.&lt;ref name=lauren2&gt;{{cite news |last1=Casella|first1=Jean |last2=Ridgeway|first2=James |title=Georgia Prisoners' Strike: "We Locked Ourselves Down" |work=[[Solitary Watch]] |date=13 December 2010 |url=http://solitarywatch.com/2010/12/13/georgia-prisoners-strike-we-locked-ourselves-down/ |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inmates throughout the state, in facilities like Rogers State Prison and [[Hays State Prison]] engaged in a “self-imposed [[lockdown]]” to incite action from the [[Georgia Department of Corrections]] in meeting their demands.&lt;ref name=lauren2 /&gt; Similar to other prison strikes demanding systemic change in the policing and policies of prisons like the Pelican State Bay hunger strike, this self-imposed lockdown strike has reached “across multiple facilities and across racial and factional lines”.&lt;ref name=lauren2 /&gt;

Solitary confinement has served as a site of inspiration for protest-organizing against its use in and outside of prisons and conversely, as a response tactic for prisons to react to the protest-organizing of its prisoners. In March 2014, authorities at the [[Northwest Detention Center]] in Washington relegated multiple detainees to solitary confinement units after their participation in protests for the improvement of conditions within the facility and in solidarity with activist organizing against deportation escalations outside of the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Honig|first1=Doug |last2=Lee|first2=Melissa |title=Hunger Strikers Released from Solitary Confinement at New Detention Center |date=4 April 2014 |publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Washington State |url=https://aclu-wa.org/news/hunger-strikers-released-solitary-confinement-nw-detention-center |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizing against the use of solitary confinement isn't limited to the work of prisoners subject to or at risk for this treatment. Community organizing outside of prisons has also occurred to shed light on the use of solitary confinement in prisons and work towards its abolition or highly refined use. Free and accessible journals like “Turning the Tide: Journal of Anti-Racist Action, Research, &amp; Education” and web-based projects like [[Solitary Watch]] and the Prisoner Hunger Strike Solidarity Coalition website also work to disseminate information about the use of solitary confinement in prisons and support actions to bring about the end of this practice in prisons.

Dr. Eisenman, an Art History professor and activist, who is involved in many “stop max” movements centered in Illinois, studies solitary confinement and explains its eventual decline.&lt;ref name=Proponents&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eisenman|first=Stephen |title=The Resistible Rise and Predictable Fall of the US Supermax |journal=[[Monthly Review]] |date=November 2009 |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=31–45 |doi=10.14452/mr-061-06-2009-10_4 |url=http://monthlyreview.org/2009/11/01/the-resistable-rise-and-predictable-fall-of-the-u-s-supermax/ |access-date=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1800s solitary confinement was practiced in the penitentiary systems and its implementation and popularity at various prisons grew throughout the centuries.&lt;ref name="Proponents" /&gt; The practice of solitary confinement grew partly because of stigmatizing language used to refer to certain prisoners like ‘the worst of the worst,’ which became a form of “self-justifying the logic of torture”.&lt;ref name="Proponents" /&gt; Yet, as the use of solitary confinement progressed, public discourse around solitary confinement transitioned from a legitimate form of punishment to torture.&lt;ref name="Proponents" /&gt; Because many prisoners in solitary confinement suffered severe mental and physical illnesses, Eisenman describes that by the end of the nineteenth century “prisoner isolation and sensory deprivation were widely understood to be forms of torture”.&lt;ref name="Proponents" /&gt; Therefore, human rights groups condemned the use of solitary confinement or ‘supermax’ systems, and national and local ‘stop max’ movements have initiated in America and worldwide to stop the use of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name="Proponents" /&gt;

==Alternatives and reform==

===Possible alternatives===
Scrutiny of super-maximum security prisons and the institutionalization of solitary confinement is accompanied by suggestions for alternative methods. One alternative is to administer medical treatment for disorderly inmates who display signs of mental illness.&lt;ref name=sahil3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrcat.org/torture-in-us-prisons/learn-more-/alternatives-to-solitary-confinement|title=Alternatives to Solitary Confinement - National Religious Campaign Against Torture|first=Heather|last=Rice|website=www.nrcat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Department of Corrections|Correction Department]] of [[New York City]] implemented plans to transfer mentally ill inmates to an internal facility for further help rather than solitary confinement in 2013.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt; Dora B. Schriro, correction commissioner, said that treatment would help turn a “one size fits all” policy into a program to promote success in jail and the outside world.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt; A second alternative is to deal with long-term inmates by promoting familial and social relationships through the encouragement of visitations which may help boost morale.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; Carl Kummerlowe believes that familial counseling and support may be useful for inmates nearing the end of a long-term sentence that may otherwise exhibit signs of aggression.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; This alternative would help inmates cope with extreme long term sentences in prisons such as those harbored in [[Pelican Bay State Prison|Pelican Bay]].&lt;ref name=king /&gt; A third alternative would involve regular reevaluation and accelerated transition of isolated inmates back to prison population to help curb long-term effects of solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=king /&gt; These alternative methods suggest a more [[restorative justice]] approach to handling high-security offenders.

===Recent reform===
Many states such as [[Colorado]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Maine]] have implemented plans to reduce use of supermax prisons and solitary confinement and have begun to show signs of reform.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt; Joseph Ponte, Corrections Commissioner of Maine, cut supermax prison population by half.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt; Colorado has announced reforms to limit the use of solitary confinement in prisons following a study that showed significant levels of confinement and isolation in prisons.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt; Washington has also showed signs of decreased use of solitary confinement, low segregation of overall prison population, and emphasis on alternative methods.&lt;ref name=sahil3 /&gt;

== Counter-arguments ==
There have been studies that have shown no difference between inmates in solitary confinement and those in normal lockup. For example, "Effect of Solitary Confinement on Prisoners" examines a study that compared twenty prison inmates that were put into isolation to twenty inmates from [[Prison|general population]] that were used as the controls.  The subjects were tested immediately before and after being put into isolation and the results showed that although there was a slight difference in subjective feelings, there were no mental or [[psychomotor retardation|psychomotor]] changes.&lt;ref name=walters1963&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walters|first1=Richard |last2=Callagan|first2=John |last3=Newman|first3=Albert |title=Effect of Solitary Confinement on Prisoners |journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]] |date=February 1963 |volume=119 |issue=8 |pages=771–73 |doi=10.1176/ajp.119.8.771 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.119.8.771?journalCode=ajp |access-date=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Effect of Solitary Confinement on Prisoners" argues that the negative effects of solitary have often been overemphasized and that the reason these negative findings are often reported is due to the characteristic difference between those who end up in solitary confinement and those who do not.&lt;ref name=walters1963/&gt;

"Reactions and Attributes of Prisoners in Solitary Confinement," analyzes multiple studies conducted at different prisons throughout the United States.  There was no difference found in the stress levels between the inmates inside of solitary confinement and those in general lockup according to this study.&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suedfeld|first1=Peter |last2=Ramirez|first2=Carmenza |last3=Deaton|first3=John |last4=Baker-Brown|first4=Gloria |title=Reactions and Attributes of Prisoners in Solitary Confinement |journal=[[Criminal Justice and Behavior]] |volume=9 |issue=3 |date=September 1982 |pages=303–40 |doi=10.1177/0093854882009003004 |url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/9/3/303.abstract |access-date=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews were conducted that showed that inmates had a fear of the mental effects that solitary confinement would have, but that mental harm rarely occurred.&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982/&gt; There was also no significant difference between the results of the [[CPI]] Scale between the control and the experimental group according to "Reactions and Attributes of Prisoners in Solitary Confinement."&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982/&gt; This article proposes the idea that some inmates have inherent characteristics that allow them to better adapt to solitary confinement while others do not, similar to the ability to adapt to any new environment.&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982/&gt;  Furthermore, it showed that the majority of inmates adapted to solitary confinement within a few days finding ways to pass time such as sleeping, thinking about the future, and exercising.&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982/&gt; This article argues that this study gives a better representation of the effects of solitary confinement as it claims the participants are average inmates in traditional solitary confinement conditions, rather than controlled experimental conditions. The conclusions drawn from this study include the argument of consistency; that in order to prove that solitary confinement is harmful to inmates, there needs to be some sort of consistent negative result and their findings do not match this.&lt;ref name=suedfeld1982/&gt;

It should be emphasized that these studies were conducted in 1963 and 1982, respectively.

==Proponents==
Proponents{{who|date=October 2016}} of solitary confinement propound that solitary confinement can improve the safety of inmates and prison staff. Earlier justifications for solitary confinement in the mid 20th century included protection for a prisoner whose sexual orientation, religion, or race were far too different and seen as vulnerable to attack from fellow inmates.{{cn |date= October 2018}}

==Solitary Confinement of Women ==
{{main|Solitary confinement of women}}
While studies have shown the effects of solitary confinement to be detrimental to all inmates, '''solitary confinement of women''' has particular consequences for women that may differ from the way it affects men. Solitary confinement rates for women in the [[United States]] are roughly comparable to those for men&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://solitarywatch.com/facts/faq/|title=FAQ|date=2012-01-31|website=Solitary Watch|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and about 20% of prisoners will be in solitary confinement at some point during their prison career.

== Incidence ==
According to the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]]’ report from 2011-2012, about 20% of female prison inmates and 17% of female jail inmates spent some time in solitary confinement during that year, numbers which are comparable to rates for men.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Solitary confinement is allegedly used to prevent violence within the prison population, and is becoming more common with the prison industrial complex and the rise in incarceration rates.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In most prisons, inmates that are put into solitary confinement fall into one of three categories: disciplinary segregation, voluntary administrative segregation, and involuntary administrative segregation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bottos, Shauna. 2007. ''Profile of Offenders in Administrative Segregation: A Review of the Literature''. Research Report No. B-39. Ottawa: Research Branch, Correctional Service of Canada.
&lt;/ref&gt; Disciplinary segregation is used as a punishment, while administrative segregation is a preventative measure intended to protect either the inmate being isolated or the other inmates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While segregation as a disciplinary measure or a precaution that protects other inmates is allegedly reserved for offenders who have committed violent acts while in prison, women in particular are often put into solitary for much smaller offenses, such as throwing things or talking back to guards.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martel|first=Joane|date=2001-01-01|title=Telling the Story: A Study in the Segregation of Women Prisoners|jstor=29768065|journal=Social Justice|volume=28|issue=1 (83)|pages=196–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also often used against women who complain of sexual assault from prison guards or other inmates.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union. 2014. “Worse Than Second-Class: Solitary Confinement of Women in the United States.” Retrieved May 2, 2016 (https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/assets/worse_than_second-class.pdf).
&lt;/ref&gt; Once they are in solitary confinement, women are often monitored more closely and disciplined more harshly than men are.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Disciplinary segregation ===
An offender who has committed a “serious disciplinary offense” may be put in solitary confinement as a punitive measure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Inmates put into disciplinary segregation are not required to be given the same privileges as those put into administrative segregation,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but the duration of their stay in isolation tends to be shorter.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Wichmann, Cherami and Kelly Taylor. 2004. ''Federally Sentenced Women in Administrative Segregation: A Descriptive Analysis''. Research Report No. R-158. Ottawa: Research Branch, Correctional Service of Canada.
&lt;/ref&gt; According to a magazine written by inmates in a California prison, the practice operates under a “guilty until proven innocent” protocol, holding prisoners in solitary confinement even before it is clear that they committed the infraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Preasmyer|first=Amy|date=2014|title=Together we can make a difference|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inmates who are considered to be politically threatening are sometimes put into isolation; although the United States does not officially hold political prisoners, some inmates in solitary confinement are there because of their political activism. This justification often means that minorities are more likely to end up in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Administrative segregation ===
Administrative segregation, or “ad seg," is typically more common than disciplinary segregation, and serves to protect either the inmate being placed in solitary or others in the prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An offender may be put into administrative segregation if they are thought to be dangerous to others or if their own safety is in danger, or if “the inmate has the potential to interfere with an ongoing investigation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Often women who vocalize the fact that they feel threatened by someone else will be put into solitary confinement, and similarly, if they are accused of acting threatening in any way, they are put into solitary without being able to defend themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rojo|first=Misty|date=2014|title=Solitary Torture in Women’s Prisons|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who are put into administrative segregation tend to be those women who have had trouble adjusting to prison life and who are seen as “high-risk” and “high-needs” when they enter the prison.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because this type of segregation is not intended as punishment, inmates in administrative segregation are legally required to be treated in the same way as those in general confinement in the prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Voluntary ====
Women prisoners sometimes request to be put into solitary confinement, most often for their own protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Specifically, some women are thought to request solitary confinement to avoid “further assaults on their identity” that might arise from their interactions and experiences in prison.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martel|first=Joane|date=2006-01-01|title=TO BE, ONE HAS TO BE SOMEWHERE: Spatio—temporality in Prison Segregation|jstor=23639455|journal=The British Journal of Criminology|volume=46|issue=4|pages=587–612}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that women who have been in voluntary administrative segregation tend to have high personal or emotional needs, and some have struggled with substance abuse, although few have difficulty with “community functioning.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Involuntary ====
Women prisoners who are deemed to be dangerous to other prisoners are sometimes put into administrative segregation; a prisoner can also be put in segregation if the officers determine that she herself is in danger and needs this protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Like women who are voluntarily put into segregation, these women tend to have high personal and emotional needs, but many of them also have difficulties functioning in the community or associating with other people.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Women put in segregation ===
In general, women tend to be subjected to harsher disciplinary practices in prisons than men.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Shaylor, Cassandra. 1998. “It's Like Living in A Black Hole: Women of Color and Solitary Confinement in the Prison Industrial Complex.” ''New England Journal on Criminal and Civil Confinement'' 385:390-420.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of solitary confinement, women are often put into segregation for committing small errors while in prison, for example spitting at a guard, while men must commit more violent infractions, such as attacking a guard, for segregation to become necessary.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This could arise from the fact that women in prison are held to especially high standards of femininity, and prisons encourage them to conform to very traditional ideas of being a woman.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This model of femininity requires women to be “pure, passive, heterosexual, and located in motherhood."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When women do not comply with this standard while imprisoned, they are punished further. In fact, some prisons specifically isolate women who seem “butch” or not traditionally feminine.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Arkles, Gabriel. 2009. "Safety and Solidarity Across Gender Lines: Rethinking Segregation of Transgender People in Detention." Temple ''Political &amp; Civil Rights Law Review'' 18(2):515-560.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another catalyst for being put into solitary confinement that applies overwhelmingly to women is that prisoners who complain of abusive treatment by guards are often segregated as retaliation. In particular, women who speak out after guards have sexually harassed them are often put into segregation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Not only does this mean that guards who are guilty of sexually harassing inmates go unpunished, it also decreases the likelihood that women will report harassment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In some prisons, women may be put into solitary confinement because their mental health issues prove to be too difficult for the authorities to deal with or are exhausting their resources.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; If the prison authorities are unable to address their inmates’ health concerns, they may put them into solitary confinement to avoid solving the problem. This means that the women in solitary confinement are often already at risk for mental health or other challenges, due to previous health concerns or sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Consequences for women ==
Solitary confinement has been shown to be detrimental to the mental and physical well-being of all inmates, but there are some ways in which being put into segregation can be more harmful for women than for men. This is often due to patriarchal structures that exist outside of the prison environment as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They “experience segregation ''as women''”; they are both subjected to slightly different treatment than men are and their perception of this treatment may differ as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Psychological effects ===
Being put into solitary confinement can be very damaging to the mental health of female inmates, particularly those with a history of mental or physical illness, as has been found in a number of studies that observed and interviewed women who were being held in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Being held in a small space without access to objects, recreation, or human contact can lead to claustrophobia, anger, depression, hallucinations,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korn|first=Richard|date=1988-01-01|title=The Effects of Confinement in the High Security Unit at Lexington|jstor=29766384|journal=Social Justice|volume=15|issue=1 (31)|pages=8–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; insomnia, and obsessive ideation or fixation on dying.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korn|first=Richard|date=1988-01-01|title=Follow-Up Report on the Effects of Confinement in the High Security Unit at Lexington|jstor=29766385|journal=Social Justice|volume=15|issue=1 (31)|pages=20–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a psychosomatic level, inmates in solitary confinement often experience a loss of appetite and/or weight, dizziness, or heart palpitations.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Prison staff often do not respond adequately to complaints of any of these symptoms, and sometimes refuse to offer medical care or medication.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Some of the anxiety that inmates, particularly female inmates, experience in solitary confinement comes from a loss or confusion of identity. Prisoners in solitary confinement are not allowed to decorate the small rooms that they are in or to bring most of their possessions that they were allowed in general confinement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This prevents the women from having any sort of entertainment, but also exacerbates feelings of a loss of individuality and of personal identity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Studies of the conditions of segregation, and interviews with the women who are subjected to them, have shown that women may also experience a collapse or confusion of identity while in prison because of their removal from their community and because of the unusual experience of space and time while in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Prisoners attach a lot of importance to the items that they have in their rooms; when they are placed into solitary confinement and no longer allowed to keep these identifying objects with them, they begin to lose their sense of self.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Further, because prisoners kept in segregation often interact little with the outside world, and because the routines of eating and cleaning may be different from in general confinement, the women lose their ability to mark time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ''The Fire Inside'' magazine, written by offenders in California women's prisons, quotes one prisoner as saying that her recommendation for those held in solitary confinement is “to create a schedule” and figure out the time of day, because it “helps to assert control over your own life and not be totally defined by whatever ‘routine’ the prison is forcing on you.”&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitehorn|first=Laura|date=2014|title=Surviving Solitary|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of their identity that is destroyed is their ability to form relationships with others. In most societies, women are perceived as being particularly social; having relationships with other people is seen as an essential element of their role as women in particular. This is of course impossible when in solitary confinement. It has been argued that this has a harmful effect on women especially. These conclusions were drawn from interviews with women who were still in solitary confinement, women who had been in solitary but had since been transferred back to the general prison population, and women who had been in solitary but had been released from incarceration, suggesting that these effects carry over beyond their time in segregation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some prisons do allow inmates in solitary confinement to use recreation rooms and exercise yards, but these are often monitored by cameras, creating a sense of powerlessness and humiliating and deterring the women from using these facilities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Feelings of powerlessness or hopeless are exacerbated by the fact that women are often unsure of how long they will be held in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

All of these factors combined can have different effects on women, making them either increasingly anxious or increasingly indifferent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While some women feel desperate and angry, others attempt to feel as little as possible in order to mitigate the effects of segregation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Because of the detrimental effect on their mental stability, inmates in solitary confinement often resort to self-harm; this behavior is more common in women than in men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can sometimes lead to women being held in solitary confinement for longer, as punishment for their destructive actions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similarly, it reinforces the guards’ perceptions of these women as particularly violent or dangerous to the rest of the prison community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Sexual abuse ===
Women in solitary confinement are often watched over by male guards, which can result in sexual harassment ranging from discomfort caused by guards watching them during private moments to nonconsensual sexual contact.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Male guards often are present while women shower or undress, stripping away the women's right to the privacy of their own bodies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because women in solitary confinement experience so little human contact, the gaze of their guards is often the only interaction that they have with another person; this can exacerbate the feelings of loss of privacy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Similarly, the clothing the women are required to wear is sexualized and humiliating.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2018}} In some prisons, women in segregation wear a “baby doll,” a long shapeless dress, with no underclothes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2018}} Although men sometimes are required to wear the “baby doll” as well, women find that wearing it while being watched by their male guards is degrading and makes them feel powerless.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2018}}

Beyond this, women in segregation are sometimes subjected to sexual abuse or physical harassment by their male guards.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They are often forced to undergo thorough strip searches, during which the guards are more forceful and invasive than is strictly necessary&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and serves mostly to demonstrate the guards’ authority over the inmates.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Because so many female inmates have been victims of sexual or physical abuse, this forces them to relive the trauma of their previous abuse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This can be especially devastating for women whose mental states are already deteriorating, due to prior mental illness or to the effects of being in segregation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It can also result in pregnancy, and pregnant women in solitary confinement—whether the pregnancy was a result of a rape by a guard or not—are often denied proper medical care.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Women have also reported stories of being publicly humiliated when asking for additional sanitary pads during their menstrual periods,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; or being forced to hand in their used pads in order to acquire a new one, according to the women who contributed to ''The Fire Inside'' magazine.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They are entirely dependent on male guards, even for such personal needs as this.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Separation from children ===
Women are more likely than men to be the primary guardian of a child or children; having a mother who is in solitary confinement, then, can be very detrimental to the children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Inmates in solitary confinement have much less frequent contact with family members, and when they do, they are usually separated by a partition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although inmates are allowed some visits from immediate family members, a long background check is required.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Children with mothers in prison are at a greater risk for depression or anxiety, substance abuse, or involvement in crime.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These factors are only furthered by the more distanced relationship that becomes necessary with a mother in solitary confinement and the restrictions on visitation that accompany that.

=== Reentry ===
Women who are released from solitary confinement into the general prison population are more likely than men to experience stigmatization and humiliation from the prison guards.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This often leads to them isolating themselves and not interacting with other prisoners even when they are not in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Once they are released from prison, too, they often have a harder time adjusting to being a part of society again, and frequently end up back in prison.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ex-offenders who were held in solitary confinement are more likely to commit violent acts against others once released than those who spent all their time in the general prison population.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; As one California prisoner who wrote for ''The Fire Inside'' prison magazine put it, “We go through these kind of mental, emotional, and spiritual stages. At first when you get here you’re angry and disoriented…Paranoia sets in…I slowly began to think of this cell as my safe place…What happens next year when they take the box away?” She, and other women in solitary confinement, become unequipped to deal with the outside world and the knowledge of technological advancement, social interaction skills, and mental stability that it requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2014|title=Stages of the SHU|url=http://womenprisoners.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Issue-49-Fall-2013.pdf|journal=The Fire Inside|issue=49|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women of color in solitary confinement ==
In general, women of color, like men of color, are more likely to be put in prison than white women and men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Likewise, they are thought to be somewhat disproportionately represented in the solitary confinement population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Margo|first=Schlanger,|date=2013-01-01|title=Prison Segregation: Symposium Introduction and Preliminary Data on Racial Disparities|url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/articles/461/|journal=Michigan Journal of Race and Law|volume=18|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that in 2011-2012, 16% of white prison inmates, 20% of black/African American prison inmates, 16% of Hispanic or Latino prison inmates, and 20% of prison with some other racial identification were in solitary confinement at some point. The difference was slightly less pronounced in jails, with 17% of white, 17% of black/African American, 15% of Hispanic/Latino, and 21% of other inmates spending time in solitary confinement. There is no data available that specifically documents the intersection between race and gender.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=5433|title=Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) - Use of Restrictive Housing in U.S. Prisons and Jails, 2011–12|website=www.bjs.gov|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the number of people of color in isolation is only slightly higher than the number of white people, their experiences in solitary confinement may differ. Women in solitary confinement are treated as less than human, in ways which parallel not only the larger societal degradation of women but also that of people of color. The sexually abusive nature of their interactions with the guards, and the denial of medical care, social contact, and resources, can be seen as racialized. In particular, guards often refer to women in solitary confinement using slurs that are both misogynist and racist.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Women who are put into solitary confinement are often isolated because of actions that challenge dominant perspectives of femininity. Because women of color are often seen as possessing these non-feminine qualities already, they are more susceptible to being put into solitary confinement because of this kind of behavior. Black women are often perceived as “aggressive and recalcitrant,” Latina women are thought to be “loud and belligerent, sexually aggressive, or…unable to speak English,” and Native American women are seen as “backward, savage, and/or primitive.” Because of these preconceptions, women of color are thought to deviate strongly from the feminine ideal, which can be grounds for putting them in solitary confinement.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Representations of crime in popular media serve to perpetuate racial stereotypes as well. Offenders of color, including women, are often portrayed as violent, hypersexual, or drug-addicted. While this is true of women of color in the general prison population as well as those held in solitary confinement, there is a particularly strong culture of fear that is built up around segregation units and the prisoners who are held there.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Inmates who appear to belong to particular minority groups are often profiled by prison guards as more likely to be dangerous, violent, or involved in a gang, and therefore are moved into isolation; for example, prisoners who speak a language other than English are sometimes targeted as foreign and therefore gang-involved or dangerous.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kerness|first=Bonnie|last2=Lewey|first2=Jamie Bissonette|date=2014-01-01|title=Race and the Politics of Isolation in U.S. Prisons|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15456870.2014.860146|journal=Atlantic Journal of Communication|volume=22|issue=1|pages=21–41|doi=10.1080/15456870.2014.860146|issn=1545-6870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''spacing effect''' is the phenomenon whereby learning is greater when studying is spread out over time, as opposed to studying the same amount of content in a single session. That is, it is better to use [[spaced presentation]] rather than [[massed presentation]]. Practically, this effect suggests that "[[cramming (memorization)|cramming]]" (intense, last-minute [[studying]]) the night before an [[exam]] is not likely to be as effective as studying at intervals in a longer time frame. It is important to note, however, that the benefit of spaced presentations does not appear at short retention intervals,{{Quantify|date=November 2013}} in which massed presentations tend to lead to better memory performance. This effect is a [[Desirable difficulties|desirable difficulty]]; it challenges the learner but leads to better learning in the long-run.

The phenomenon was first identified by [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]], and his detailed study of it was published in the 1885 book ''Über das Gedächtnis. Untersuchungen zur experimentellen Psychologie'' (''Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology''). This robust finding has been supported by studies of many explicit [[memory]] tasks such as [[free recall]], [[Recall (memory)|recognition]], [[cued-recall]], and [[frequency estimation]] (for reviews see Crowder 1976; Greene, 1989).

Researchers have offered several possible explanations of the spacing effect, and much research has been conducted that supports its impact on recall.  In spite of these findings, the robustness of this phenomenon and its resistance to [[experimental manipulation]] have made empirical testing of its parameters difficult.

==Causes for spacing effect==
Decades of research on memory and recall have produced many different theories and findings on the spacing effect. In a study conducted by Cepeda et al. (2006) participants who used spaced practice on memory tasks outperformed those using massed practice in 259 out of 271 cases.

As different studies support different aspects of this effect, some now believe that an appropriate account should be multifactorial, and at present, different mechanisms are invoked to account for the spacing effect in [[free recall]] and in [[explicit cued-memory tasks]].

Not much attention has been given to the study of the spacing effect in long-term retention tests. Shaughnessy (1977) found that the spacing effect is not robust for twice-presented items after a 24-hour delay in testing. The spacing effect is present, however, for items presented four or six times and tested after a 24-hour delay. The result was interesting because other studies using only twice-presented items have shown a strong spacing effect, although the lag between learning and testing was longer. Shaughnessy interprets it as evidence that no single explanatory mechanism can be used to account for the various manifestations of the spacing effect.&lt;ref&gt;Long-Term Retention and the Spacing Effect in Free-Recall and Frequency Judgments John J. Shaughnessy The American Journal of Psychology Vol. 90, No. 4 (Dec., 1977), pp. 587-598 Published by: University of Illinois Press Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1421733&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semantic priming ===
Research has shown reliable spacing effects in cued-memory tasks under incidental learning conditions, where [[semantic analysis (knowledge representation)|semantic analysis]] is encouraged through [[orienting tasks]] (Challis, 1993; Russo &amp; Mammaralla, 2002). Challis found a spacing effect for target words using a frequency estimation task after words were incidentally analyzed semantically. However, no spacing effect was found when the target words were shallowly encoded using a graphemic study task. This suggests that [[semantic priming]] underlies the spacing effect in cued-memory tasks. When items are presented in a massed fashion, the first occurrence of the target semantically primes the mental representation of that target, such that when the second occurrence appears directly after the first, there is a reduction in its semantic processing.  Semantic priming wears off after a period of time (Kirsner, Smith, Lockhart, &amp; King, 1984), which is why there is less semantic priming of the second occurrence of a spaced item. Thus on the semantic priming account, the second presentation is more strongly primed and receives less semantic processing when the repetitions are massed compared to when presentations are spaced over short lags (Challis, 1993). This semantic priming mechanism provides spaced words with more extensive processing than massed words, producing the spacing effect.

From this explanation of the spacing effect, it follows that this effect should not occur with nonsense stimuli that do not have a [[semantic representation]] in [[memory]]. A number of studies have demonstrated that the semantically based repetition priming approach cannot explain spacing effects in [[recognition memory]] for stimuli such as unfamiliar faces, and non-words that are not amenable to semantic analysis (Russo, Parkin, Taylor, &amp; Wilks, 1998; Russo et al., 2002; Mammarella, Russo, &amp; Avons, 2005). Cornoldi and Longoni (1977) have even found a significant spacing effect in a [[forced-choice recognition memory]] task when nonsense shapes were used as target stimuli. Russo et al. (1998) proposed that with cued memory of unfamiliar stimuli, a short-term perceptually-based repetition priming mechanism supports the spacing effect. When unfamiliar stimuli are used as targets in a cued-memory task, memory relies on the retrieval of structural-perceptual information about the targets. When the items are presented in a massed fashion, the first occurrence primes its second occurrence, leading to reduced perceptual processing of the second presentation. Short-term repetition-priming effects for nonwords are reduced when the lag between prime and target trials is reduced from zero to six (McKone, 1995), thus it follows that more extensive perceptual processing is given to the second occurrence of spaced items relative to that given to massed items. Hence, nonsense items with massed presentation receive less extensive perceptual processing than spaced items; thus, the retrieval of those items is impaired in cued-memory tasks.

Congruent with this view, Russo et al. (2002) demonstrated that changing the [[font]] in which repeated presentations of nonwords were presented reduced the short-term perceptual priming of those stimuli, especially for massed items. Upon a recognition memory test, there was no spacing effect found for the nonwords presented in different fonts during study. These results support the hypothesis that short-term [[Semantic priming#Perceptual and conceptual priming|perceptual priming]] is the mechanism that supports the spacing effects in cued-memory tasks when unfamiliar stimuli are used as targets.  Furthermore, when the font was changed between repeated presentations of words in the study phase, there was no reduction of the spacing effect. This resistance to the font manipulation is expected with this two-factor account, as semantic processing of words at study determines performance on a later memory test, and the font manipulation is irrelevant to this form of processing.

Mammarella, Russo, &amp; Avons (2002) also demonstrated that changing the orientation of [[face]]s between repeated presentations served to eliminate the spacing effect. Unfamiliar faces do not have stored representations in memory, thus the spacing effect for these stimuli would be a result of perceptual priming. Changing orientation served to alter the physical appearance of the [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], thus reducing the perceptual priming at the second occurrence of the face when presented in a massed fashion. This led to equal memory for faces presented in massed and spaced fashions, hence eliminating the spacing effect.

=== Encoding variability ===
According to the ''encoding variability'' view, spaced repetition typically entails some variability in presentation contexts, resulting in a greater number of retrieval cues. Contrastingly, massed repetitions have limited presentations and therefore fewer retrieval cues.

To test the Encoding Variability theory, Bird, Nicholson and Ringer (1978) &lt;ref&gt;Resistance of the Spacing Effect to Variations in Encoding Charles P. Bird, Angus J. Nicholson and Susan Ringer The American Journal of Psychology Vol. 91, No. 4 (Dec., 1978), pp. 713-721 Published by: University of Illinois Press Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1421519&lt;/ref&gt; presented subjects with word lists that either had massed or spaced repetitions. Subjects were asked to perform various "orienting tasks," tasks which require the subject to make a simple judgment about the list item (i.e. pleasant or unpleasant, active or passive). Subjects either performed the same task for each occurrence of a word or a different task for each occurrence. If the Encoding Variability theory were true, then the case of different orienting tasks ought to provide variable encoding, even for massed repetitions, resulting in a higher rate of recall for massed repetitions than would be expected. The results showed no such effect, providing strong evidence against the importance of Encoding Variability.

=== Study-phase retrieval theory ===
A theory that has gained a lot of traction recently{{when|date=December 2018}} is the ''study-phase retrieval theory''. This theory assumes that the first presentation is retrieved at the time of the second. This leads to an elaboration of the first memory trace. Massed presentations do not yield advantages because the first trace is active at the time of the second, so it is not retrieved or elaborated upon. Greene (1989) proposed a two-factor account of the spacing effect, combining deficient processing and study-phase retrieval accounts. Spacing effects in free recall are accounted for by the study-phase retrieval account. Under the assumption that free recall is sensitive to contextual associations, spaced items are at an advantage over massed items by the additional encoding of contextual information. Thus, the second occurrence of an item in a list reminds the observer of the previous occurrence of that same item and of its previous contextual features. Different contextual information is encoded with each presentation, whereas for massed items, the difference in [[Context (language use)|context]] is relatively small. More retrieval cues, then, are encoded with spaced learning, which in turn leads to improved recall.

=== Deficient processing ===
According to the ''deficient processing'' view, massed repetitions lead to deficient processing of the second presentation—that we simply do not pay much attention to the later presentations (Hintzman et al., 1973).  Greene (1989) proposed this to be the case in [[cued-memory tasks]] (e.g. [[recognition memory]], [[frequency estimation]] tasks), which rely more on item information and less on contextual information. The increased voluntary rehearsal of spaced items makes this deficient processing noticeable. Findings that the spacing effect is not found when items are studied through [[incidental learning]] support this account.

=== Retrieval effort hypothesis ===
According to research conducted by Pyc and Rawson (2009) successful but effortful retrieval tasks during practice enhance memory in an account known as the ''retrieval effort hypothesis''. Spacing out the learning and relearning of items leads to a more effortful retrieval which provides for deeper processing of the item.

== Practical applications and long-term retention ==

===Advertising===
The spacing effect and its underlying mechanisms  have important applications to the world of advertising. For instance, the spacing effect dictates that it is not an effective advertising strategy to present the same commercial back-to-back (massed repetition). If encoding variability  is an important mechanism of the spacing effect, then a good advertising strategy might include a distributed presentation of different versions of the same ad.

Appleton-Knapp, Bjork and Wickens (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Examining the Spacing Effect in Advertising: Encoding Variability, Retrieval Processes, and Their Interaction Sara L. Appleton‐Knapp, Robert A. Bjork and Thomas D. Wickens The Journal of Consumer Research Vol. 32, No. 2 (September 2005), pp. 266-276 Published by: The University of Chicago Press Article {{doi|10.1086/432236}} Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/432236&lt;/ref&gt; examined the effects of spacing on advertising.

They found that spaced repetitions of advertisements are more affected by study-phase retrieval processes than encoding variability. They also found that at long intervals, varying the presentation of a given ad is not effective in producing higher recall rates among subjects (as predicted by variable encoding). Despite this finding, recognition is not affected by variations in an ad at long intervals.

===Application in education===
Although it is accepted that spacing is beneficial in learning a subject well and previous units should be revisited and practiced, textbooks are written in discrete chapters that do not support these findings. Rohrer conducted a two-part study in 2006 where students were taught how to solve math problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rohrer, Taylor|first=Doug, Kelli|date=April 19, 2007|title=The shuffling of mathematics problems improves learning|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doug_Rohrer/publication/227181272_The_shuffling_of_mathematics_problems_improves_learning/links/0046351d5cf02c19bb000000.pdf|journal=Intr Sci (2007)|doi=10.1007/s11251-007-9015-8|pmid=|access-date=April 23, 2016|volume=35|pages=481–498}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part 1, students either used mass or spaced practice, and spaced practice showed significant improvement over mass practice when tested one week later. In the second part of the experiment, practice problems were either grouped by type or mixed randomly. The desirable difficulties encountered by the randomly mixed problems were effective, and the performance by students who solved the randomly mixed problems was vastly superior to the students who solved the problems grouped by type. The reasoning behind this increased performance was that students know the formula for solving equations, but do not always know when to apply the formula. By shuffling problems around and dispersing them across multiple chapters, students also learn to identify when it is appropriate to use which formula. There is conclusive evidence that cumulative final exams promote long-term retention by forcing spaced learning to occur.

===Learning and pedagogy===
The long-term effects of spacing have also been assessed in the context of learning a foreign language. Bahrick et al. (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Maintenance of Foreign Language Vocabulary and the Spacing Effect Harry P. Bahrick, Lorraine E. Bahrick, Audrey S. Bahrick and Phyllis E. Bahrick Psychological Science Vol. 4, No. 5 (Sep., 1993), pp. 316-321 Published by: Sage Publications, Inc. on behalf of the Association for Psychological Science Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40063054&lt;/ref&gt; examined the retention of newly learned foreign vocabulary words as a function of relearning sessions and intersession spacing over a 9-year period.

Both the amount of relearning session and the number of days in between each session have a major impact on retention (the repetition effect and the spacing effect), yet the two variables do not interact with each other.

For all three difficulty rankings of the foreign words, recall was highest for the 56-day interval as opposed to a 28-day or a 14-day interval. Additionally, 13 sessions spaced 56 days apart yielded comparable retention to 26 sessions with a 14-day interval.

These findings have implications for educational practices. Current school and university curricula rarely provide students with opportunities for periodic retrieval of previously acquired knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/james-gupta/the-death-of-the-universi_b_8173492.html "The death of the university lecture"], Huffington Post, retrieved 2016-25-04&lt;/ref&gt; Without spaced repetitions, students are more likely to forget foreign language vocabulary.

=== Lag effect ===
While the spacing effect refers to improved recall for spaced versus successive (mass) repetition, the term 'lag' can be interpreted as the time interval between repetitions of learning. The ''lag effect'' is simply an idea branching off the spacing effect that states recall after long lags between learning is better versus short lags.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahana|first=Michael|date=2005|title=Spacing and lag effects in free recall of pure lists|url=https://memory.psych.upenn.edu/files/pubs/KahaHowa05.pdf|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|doi=10.3758/bf03196362|pmid=|access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Kahana's study showed strong evidence that the lag effect is present when recalling word lists. In 2008, Kornell and Bjork published a study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kornell, Bjork|first=Nate, Robert|date=2008|title=Is Spacing the "Enemy of Induction"?|url=http://psych.colorado.edu/~ketels/psych4145/Kornell.Bjork.2008a.pdf|journal=Psychological Science|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02127.x|pmid=|access-date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that suggested inductive learning is more effective when spaced than massed. Inductive learning is learning through observation of exemplars, so the participants did not actively take notes or solve problems. These results were replicated and backed up by a second independent study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verkoeijen|first=Peter P. J. L.|last2=Bouwmeester|first2=Samantha|date=2014-01-01|title=Is spacing really the "friend of induction"?|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=5|pages=259|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00259|issn=1664-1078|pmc=3978334|pmid=24744742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{One source|article|date=October 2010}}

'''Takt time''' is the average time between the start of production of one unit and the start of production of the next unit, when these production starts are set to match the rate of customer demand. For example, if a customer wants 10 units per week, then, given a 40-hour work week and steady flow through the production line, the average time between production starts should be 4 hours (actually less than that in order to account for things like machine downtime and scheduled paid employee breaks), yielding 10 units produced per week. In fact, takt time simply reflects the rate of production needed to match the demand.  In the previous example, whether it takes 4 minutes or 4 years to produce the product, the takt time is based on customer demand.  If a process or a production line are unable to produce at takt time, either demand leveling, additional resources, or process re-engineering is needed to correct the issue.

== Etymology ==
Takt time is a borrowing of the Japanese word ''{{transl|ja|takutotaimu}}'' ({{Lang|ja|タクトタイム}}), which in turn was borrowed from the German word ''{{Lang|de|Taktzeit}}'', meaning clock interval. The word was likely introduced to Japan by German engineers in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/engineering-systems-division/esd-60-lean-six-sigma-processes-summer-2004/lecture-notes/8_1assembly_op.pdf|title=Takt Time|
last1=Graban|first1=Mark|last2=Ducharme|first2=Colin|last3=Ruddick|first3=Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Assuming a product is made one unit at a time at a constant rate during the net available work time, the takt time is the amount of time that must elapse between two consecutive unit completions in order to meet the demand.

Takt time can be first determined with the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{T_{a}}{D}&lt;/math&gt;

Where&lt;br&gt;
T&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;= Takt time, e.g. [work time between two consecutive units]&lt;br&gt;
T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = Net time available to work, e.g. [work time per period]&lt;br&gt;
D = Demand (customer demand), e.g. [units required per period]

Net available time is the amount of time available for work to be done. This excludes [[Break (work)|break time]]s and any expected stoppage time (for example [[scheduled maintenance]], team briefings, etc.).
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Example''':&lt;br&gt; If there are a total of 8 hours (or 480 minutes) in a shift (gross time) less 30 minutes lunch, 30 minutes for breaks (2 × 15 mins), 10 minutes for a team briefing and 10 minutes for basic maintenance checks, then the net ''Available Time to Work'' = 480 - 30 - 30 - 10 - 10 = 400 minutes.

If customer demand were 400 units a day and one shift were being run, then the line would be required to output at a minimum rate of one part per minute in order to be able to keep up with customer demand.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In reality, people and machines cannot maintain 100% efficiency and there will be stoppages for other reasons. Allowances should be made for these instances, and thus the line will be set up to run at a faster rate to account for this.

Also, takt time may be adjusted according to requirements within the company. For example, if one department delivers parts to several manufacturing lines, it often makes sense to use similar takt times on all lines to smooth out flow from the preceding station. Customer demand can still be met by adjusting daily working time, reducing [[down time]]s on machines and so on.

Some of the early literature uses ''cycle time'' for takt time.

== Implementation ==
Takt time is calculated on virtually every task in a business environment. It is used in manufacturing ([[casting]] of parts, drilling holes, or preparing a workplace for another task), control tasks (testing of parts or adjusting machinery), or in administration (answering standard inquiries or [[call center]] operation). It is, however, most common in production lines that move a product along a line of stations that each performs a set of predefined tasks.

Once a takt system is implemented there are a number of benefits:
* The product moves along a line, so [[bottleneck (project management)|bottleneck]]s (stations that need more time than planned) are easily identified when the product does not move on in time.
* Correspondingly, stations that don't operate reliably (suffer frequent breakdown, etc.) are easily identified.
* The takt leaves only a certain amount of time to perform the actual [[value added]] work. Therefore, there is a strong motivation to get rid of all non value-adding tasks (like machine set-up, gathering of tools, transporting products, etc.)
* Workers and machines perform sets of similar tasks, so they don't have to adapt to new processes every day, increasing their productivity.
* There is no place in the takt system for removal of a product from the assembly line at any point before completion, so opportunities for [[shrinkage (accounting)|shrink]] and damage in transit are minimized.

Downsides of takt time organization include:
* When customer demand rises so much that takt time has to come down, quite a few tasks have to be either reorganized to take even less time to fit into the shorter takt time, or they have to be split up between two stations (which means another station has to be squeezed into the line and workers have to adapt to the new setup)
* When one station in the line breaks down for whatever reason the whole line comes to a grinding halt, unless there are buffer capacities for preceding stations to get rid of their products and following stations to feed from. A built-in buffer of three to five percent downtime allows needed adjustments or recovery from failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Kaizen Blitz: accelerating breakthroughs in productivity and performance |last=Laraia|first=Anthony C. |author2=Patricia E. Moody |author3=Robert W. Hall  |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-471-24648-0}}{{Page needed|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Short takt time can put considerable stress on the "moving parts" of a production system or subsystem. In automated systems/subsystems, increased [[Stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]] increases the likelihood of breakdown, and in non-automated systems/subsystems, personnel face both increased physical stress (which increases the risk of [[Repetitive motion injury|repetitive motion]] (also "stress or "strain") [[Repetitive motion injury|injury]]), intensified emotional stress, and lowered [[motivation]], sometimes to the point of increased [[absenteeism]].
* Tasks have to be [[production leveling|leveled]] to make sure tasks don't bulk in front of certain stations due to peaks in workload. This decreases the flexibility of the system as a whole.
* The concept of takt time doesn’t account for human factors such as an operator needing an unexpected bathroom break or a brief rest period between units (especially for processes involving significant physical labor).  In practice, this means that the production processes must be realistically capable of operation above peak takt and demand must be leveled in order to avoid wasted line capacity

'''Temporal encroachment''' is an action that affects the perception of time or that affects the ability to take action in the [[future]]. [[Time|Temporal]] means ''related to the measurement or passing of time'' and encroachment is ''an intrusion, usually unwelcome, into the space of another''.

The space that temporal encroachment refers to is temporal space, the temporal "space" or "territory" upon which others attach significance.

There are various kinds of temporal encroachment:

==Scheduling==
This is when one group or person delays another person. A good example is a vice president making a lower-ranked employee wait in his outer office while he conducts business. Another good example is a valued worker who always shows up late to work but this is allowed due to his abilities. This kind of encroachment is very common in the workplace. Various [[cultures]] look at this differently—the [[Japan]]ese are very punctual, while most [[Latin]] and [[Baltic region|Baltic]] cultures would be more relaxed with time, instead looking at social parameters.

==Future 'space'==
This refers to actions taken that influence events 'down the line', narrowing possible choices and alternatives.  It is worth noting that the most common use of this phrase is found in [[ecology]], where there is a large amount of concern about the effects of human encroachment upon animals and other wildlife.  Encroachment can be a good or bad factor in the lives of the animals, but most commonly, it is bad.

It has been used by some [[Jewish]] thinkers&lt;ref name="springer"&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/q7122u6t67863756/fulltext.pdf SpringerLink - Resource Secured&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to changes in [[Zionism]] that have 'ripple effects' on Jews worldwide, and the effect this has had on global terrorism.

It has also been used in the [[legal]] system, where some legal thinkers believe early correction of poverty and other socioeconomic ills can 'narrow' the likelihood of future [[criminality]].

==Past 'space'==
It can also reflect a sense that modern events and interpretations of [[history]] alter and change our perceptions of history. For example, the involvement of the Papacy in the formation of the structure of medieval Europe was viewed differently at the time than it is today.{{citation needed|date=December 2008|reason= stale link: http://www.historicist.com/papacy/b1c5.html }}

Some also view it as the encroachment of the young on the old, see ''Encroachment of old age'' below.

==Examples==
Some examples of temporal encroachment in other contexts.&lt;ref name="first"&gt;[http://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs00s/encroacv.php#temp Varieties of Encroachment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Encroachment from flooding:''' Construction of settlements in flood plains, ignoring the tendency of rivers to flood occasionally, results in situations in which river water encroaches on properties in ways that can prove extremely costly. Here encroachment on flood plains by buildings engenders encroachment by flooding.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Encroachment from rising sea levels:''' This is a more dramatic and permanent example of encroachment from flooding whose major effects are predicted to become evident over the coming decades. It is caused by failure to respond effectively to the challenge of global warming and rising carbon emissions. Here encroachment on air quality engenders encroachment by rising sea levels. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Encroachment by disease resistant bacteria:''' The widespread development and use of pharmaceutical drugs to control disease has created a situation in which bacteria are mutating and treatment-resistant bacteria are becoming a major challenge to hospitals. Here encroachment by progressive pharmaceutical response to disease engenders encroachment by bacterial resistance to those treatments. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Encroachment from population pressure:''' This widely documented phenomenon is associated with the ever-increasing use of non-renewable resources. Here encroachment by increasing population (and reproductive rights) engenders encroachment by the demands on resources which there is a reasonable probability cannot be fulfilled and will therefore engender a violent and unreasonable response.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Encroachment of old age:''' The process of ageing, and terminal illness, may be experienced as encroaching shadows on human dignity. Equally, while near the peak of their careers, people may note the encroachment of youth and change. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other uses==
In medical terminology, a temporal encroachment has to do with bones in the skull pressing tightly against the brain after an injury to the head.

In computer science, a [[temporal key]] that is improperly validatated is considered a temporal encroachment.

'''The Tanster''' is an American artist in the [[Hamptons]] on the East End of [[Long Island]] in [[New York State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Street Art|url=http://paintingthehamptons.blogspot.com/2015/01/street-art.html|website=Painting the Hamptons|publisher=Gail Gallagher|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began installing public art works in the community in the late Summer of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Brendan|title=Another Guerilla Artist Posts Art Across The Hamptons|url=http://www.danspapers.com/2014/10/another-guerilla-artist-posts-art-across-the-hamptons/|issue=10.2.14|publisher=Dan's Papers|date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her project was named as one the top 10 artistic events in 2014 by the cultural magazine ''[[Dan's Papers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peterson|first1=Oliver|title=Top 10 Hamptons Art Moments of 2014|url=http://www.danspapers.com/2014/12/top-10-hamptons-art-moments-of-2014/|publisher=Dan's Papers|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tanster has partnered with a local charity, the Coalition For Women's Cancers at [[Southampton Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Segal|first1=Mark|title="Tanster" Pays It Forward For Women's Cancers|url=http://easthamptonstar.com/Arts/2015305/Tanster-Pays-It-Forward-Womens-Cancers|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=The East Hampton Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each piece of pop up art that The Tanster installs includes donation information for the Coalition. People are encouraged to take the art when they find it. On the back of it is a request for donations and a guide on how people can help.&lt;ref name="east1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Melillo|first1=Alyssa|title=They Call Her 'The Tanster,' And She's on a Rainbow-Filled Mission|url=http://www.27east.com/news/article.cfm/East-End/102797/They-Call-Her-The-Tanster-And-Shes-On-A-Rainbow-Filled-Mission|accessdate=April 14, 2015|publisher=Southampton Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tanster has received corporate sponsorships for her project, including contributions from Home Depot, Rust-Oleum and Meineke.&lt;ref name="east1"/&gt;

==Biography==
The Tanster was born in Southampton Hospital in [[Southampton, New York]], United States and attended Southampton High School. She graduated [[Magna Cum Laude]] from [[Stony Brook University]] and has a master's degree in video production from the [[New York Institute of Technology]]. For a year she lived in Paris, France, studying art history at the [[Sorbonne]]. Her photographs have been published in magazines all over the world and her celebrity photography is currently managed by [[Getty Images]]. She began installing pop up public art in the Hamptons in August 2014.&lt;ref name="east1"/&gt;

==Technique==
The primary style of The Tanster public art installations involves repurposed yard signs spray painted in rainbow palettes. Oftentimes the pieces include original stencils. The yard signs which serve as her canvases are typically plastic rectangles. The Tanster creates her works in a studio in Water Mill, New York and then places them out in the public, either mounted on metal frames or stapled with wire to posts. She also paints, tie dyes, sews and makes videos.

==Podcast media==
In February 2016, The Tanster was interviewed on [[iHeart Radio]]'s Savvy Central channel by Christina Nitschmann. During the interview, The Tanster discussed a variety of topics, including both the origins of her charity rainbow street art project and how she became interested in [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBOCpxkHMKk |title=Artist 'The Tanster' &amp; Steve Lubetkin The Power of Podcasting |publisher=YouTube |date=February 21, 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July of 2018, The Tanster did a wide ranging, two part interview on The Scott Johnson Radio Show on the Building Fortunes Radio Network. The topics covered included her ongoing, multi-media art project which she characterized as a [[Hero's Journey]] partially inspired by [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]. During the interview, Tanster also discussed her efforts to highlight the statements of Ben Szemkus, an eyewitness whose story links the allegedly sadistic [[NXIVM]] sex cult and certain political elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Scott Johnson Radio Show|url=http://www.buildingfortunesradio.com/scott-johnson-peter-mingils/scott-johnson-bring-the-tanster-on-building-fortunes-radio-to-talk-about-ben-szemkus-and-nxivms-keith-raniere-allison-mack-meeting-with-cohost-peter-mingils-2053|website=Building Fortunes Radio Network|publisher=PM Marketing LLC|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Tanster is currently using her artistic talents and her industry to promote public awareness of the elicit behaviors of corrupt institutions and private groups. Her blog is a center of information regarding various topics of public concern. Tanster was featured on Neon Nettle as a source about the persecution that NXIVM whistleblower Ben Szemkus was facing for coming forward with his story. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neon Nettle|url=https://neonnettle.com/news/4626-whistleblower-who-exposed-hillary-clinton-s-child-trafficking-ties-feared-dead|website=Neon Nettle|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trashion''' (a [[portmanteau]] of "trash" and "fashion") is a term for art, jewellery, fashion and objects for the home created from used, thrown-out, found and repurposed elements.  The term was first coined in [[New Zealand]] in 2004&lt;ref&gt;[http://threadnz.com/fashion/fashion-shows/turn-your-trash-into-trashion "Turn your trash into 'trashion',"] Thread.co.nz, 2004. Retrieved 19 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and gained in usage through 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Scholtus, Petz. [http://www.treehugger.com/style/vaho-is-trashion.html "Vaho is Trashion,"] Treehugger.com, 6 June 2005. Retrieved 19 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Trashion is a subgenre of [[found object]] art, which is basically using objects that already have some other defined purpose, and turning it into art. In this case, trash is used.

Initially trashion was used to describe art-[[haute couture|couture]] costume usually linked to contests or fashion shows; however, as recycling and 'green' fashion become more prevalent, trashion has taken a turn for the more wearable.  The term is now widely used in creative circles to describe any wearable item or accessory that is constructed using all or part materials that have been recycled, including clothing that has been thrifted and reconditioned.

==Philosophy==
Trashion is a philosophy and an ethic encompassing [[environmentalism]] and [[innovation]]. Making traditional objects out of recycled materials can be trashion, as can making avant-garde fashion from cast-offs or junk.  It springs from a desire to make the best use of limited resources. Trashion is similar to [[upcycling]] and refashion, although it began with specific fashion aspirations.  Like upcycling, trashion generates items that are valued again, but these may be low-cost or high-cost, perhaps depending on the skill of the artist. The environmental aim of trashion is to call attention to the polluting outcome of waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Trashion' designer Marina DeBris turns ocean rubbish into high-end outfits – in pictures|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/sep/13/trashion-designer-marina-debris-turns-ocean-rubbish-into-high-end-outfits-in-pictures|accessdate=14 September 2016|work=The Guardian|date=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Indigenous people throughout the world have used salvaged materials to create new objects for an indeterminate number of years.  Africans have made bags from rice and juice packets, Haitians have made sculptural jewelry from old oil cans, and American settlers have made quilts and rugs from cast-off clothing and feed sacks.  People were making something from nothing long before the word "trashion" was coined; however, Trashion usually refers to "making something from nothing" for aesthetic purposes, not for practical use.

In the 1990s, American artist Ann Wizer began using [[plastic pollution|plastic waste]] in her [[wearable art]].  Working in the Philippines, and titling her line the 'Virus Project,' Wizer created a set of costumes made entirely from post consumer plastic waste to celebrate [[Earth Day]]. The first plastic packaging tote bags were accessories to these costumes. There are now numerous small scale [[poverty reduction|poverty intervention]] projects throughout Southeast Asia in the process of creating similar trashion accessories and other fashion and homeware items. This includes the XSProject, a charity founded by Wizer and based in [[Jakarta]].

The Trashion movement took off in New York City in late 2004, early 2005 through underground parties on the lower east side of Manhattan at a club called Plan B. Trashion was part of the fashion of Urban Gypsy Circus, which is an interactive art party thrown by multi-media artist Miz Metro. These parties exhibited art made out of recycled materials and included monthly "TRASHION FACEOFFS" where 2 designers would compete to be the "TRASHION QUEEN". This led to Matthew Namer &amp; Miz Metro curating the TRASHION Art show at Gallery 151 on exhibit during the summer of 2009 on the lower east side of Manhattan.

Trashion has become a very popular style of art. For example, in 2006, Julia Genatossio launched Monsoon Vermont, a trashion design house.  The company designs items such as umbrellas, shower curtains and backpacks which are made from Jakarta's scavenged trash. Unlike the XSProject, Monsoon Vermont is a for-profit venture.&lt;ref&gt;Regis, Necee.

Retrieved 25 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In various branches of [[mathematics]], a useful construction is often viewed as the “most efficient solution” to a certain problem.  The definition of a '''universal property''' uses the language of [[category theory]] to make this notion precise and to study it abstractly.

This article gives a general treatment of universal properties. To understand the concept, it is useful to study several examples first, of which there are many: all [[free object]]s, [[direct product]] and [[direct sum]], [[free group]], [[free lattice]], [[Grothendieck group]], [[Dedekind–MacNeille completion]], [[product topology]], [[Stone–Čech compactification]], [[tensor product]], [[inverse limit]] and [[direct limit]], [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]] and [[cokernel]], [[pullback (category theory)|pullback]], [[pushout (category theory)|pushout]] and [[Equaliser (mathematics)|equalizer]].

== Motivation ==

Before giving a formal definition of universal properties, we offer some motivation for studying such constructions.

* The concrete details of a given construction may be messy, but if the construction satisfies a universal property, one can forget all those details: all there is to know about the construct is already contained in the universal property. Proofs often become short and elegant if the universal property is used rather than the concrete details. For example, the [[tensor algebra]] of a [[vector space]] is slightly painful to actually construct, but using its universal property makes it much easier to deal with.
* Universal properties define objects uniquely up to a unique [[isomorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009), Proposition 1.6, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, one strategy to prove that two objects are isomorphic is to show that they satisfy the same universal property.
* Universal constructions are functorial in nature: if one can carry out the construction for every object in a category ''C'' then one obtains a [[functor]] on ''C''. Furthermore, this functor is a [[adjoint functors|right or left adjoint]] to the functor ''U'' used in the definition of the universal property.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Polcino &amp; Sehgal (2002), p. 133. exercise 1, about the universal property of [[group ring]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Universal properties occur everywhere in mathematics. By understanding their abstract properties, one obtains information about all these constructions and can avoid repeating the same analysis for each individual instance.

==Formal definition==

Suppose that ''U'': ''D'' → ''C'' is a [[functor]] from a [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''D'' to a category ''C'', and let ''X'' be an object of ''C''.  Consider the following [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] (opposite) notions:

{{anchor|Initial morphism}}
An '''initial morphism''' from ''X'' to ''U'' is an [[initial object]] in the [[Comma category|category &lt;math&gt;(X \downarrow U)&lt;/math&gt; of morphisms from ''X'' to ''U'']].  In other words, it consists of a pair (''A'', ''Φ'') where ''A'' is an object of ''D'' and ''Φ'': ''X'' → ''U''(''A'') is a morphism in ''C'', such that the following '''initial property''' is satisfied:
*Whenever ''Y'' is an object of ''D'' and ''f'': ''X'' → ''U''(''Y'') is a morphism in ''C'', then there exists a ''unique'' morphism ''g'': ''A'' → ''Y'' such that the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]]:
[[File:UniversalProperty-03.svg|center|An initial morphism from X to U|200px]]

{{anchor|Terminal morphism}}
A '''terminal morphism''' from ''U'' to ''X'' is a [[terminal object]] in the [[comma category]] &lt;math&gt;(U \downarrow X)&lt;/math&gt; of morphisms from ''U'' to ''X''.  In other words, it consists of a pair (''A'', ''Φ'') where ''A'' is an object of ''D'' and ''Φ'': ''U''(''A'') → ''X'' is a morphism in ''C'', such that the following '''terminal property''' is satisfied:
*Whenever ''Y'' is an object of ''D'' and ''f'': ''U''(''Y'') → ''X'' is a morphism in ''C'', then there exists a ''unique'' morphism ''g'': ''Y'' → ''A'' such that the following diagram commutes:
[[File:UniversalProperty-04.svg|center|A terminal morphism from U to X|200px]]

The term '''universal morphism'''&lt;ref&gt;It is also called a universal arrow; for example in {{harv|Mac Lane|1998|loc=Ch. III, § 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers either to an initial morphism or a terminal morphism, and the term '''universal property''' refers either to an initial property or a terminal property.  In each definition, the existence of the morphism ''g'' intuitively expresses the fact that (''A'', ''Φ'') is "general enough", while the uniqueness of the morphism ensures that (''A'', ''Φ'') is "not too general".

==Duality==

Since the notions of ''initial'' and ''terminal'' are dual, it is often enough to discuss only one of them, and simply reverse arrows in ''C'' for the dual discussion.  Alternatively, the word ''universal'' is often used in place of both words.

Note: some authors may call only one of these constructions a ''universal morphism'' and the other one a ''co-universal morphism''. Which is which depends on the author, although in order to be consistent with the naming of [[Limit (category theory)|limits and colimits]] the latter construction should be named universal and the former couniversal. This article uses the unambiguous terminology of initial and terminal objects.

==Examples==

Below are a few examples, to highlight the general idea. The reader can construct numerous other examples by consulting the articles mentioned in the introduction.

===Tensor algebras===

Let ''C'' be the [[category of vector spaces]] '''''K''-Vect''' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' and let ''D'' be the category of [[algebra over a field|algebras]] '''''K''-Alg''' over ''K'' (assumed to be [[unital algebra|unital]] and [[associative algebra|associative]]). Let
:''U'' : '''''K''-Alg''' &amp;rarr; '''''K''-Vect'''
be the [[forgetful functor]] which assigns to each algebra its underlying vector space.

Given any [[vector space]] ''V'' over ''K'' we can construct the [[tensor algebra]] ''T''(''V'') of ''V''. The tensor algebra is characterized by the fact:
:“Any linear map from ''V'' to an algebra ''A'' can be uniquely extended to an [[algebra homomorphism]] from ''T''(''V'') to ''A''.”
This statement is an initial property of the tensor algebra since it expresses the fact that the pair (''T''(''V''), ''i''), where ''i'' : ''V'' → ''U''(''T''(''V'')) is the inclusion map, is an initial morphism from the vector space ''V'' to the functor ''U''.

Since this construction works for any vector space ''V'', we conclude that ''T'' is a functor from '''''K''-Vect''' to '''''K''-Alg'''.  This means that ''T'' is ''left adjoint'' to the forgetful functor ''U'' (see the section below on [[#Relation to adjoint functors|relation to adjoint functors]]).

===Products===

A [[categorical product]] can be characterized by a terminal property. For concreteness, one may consider the [[Cartesian product]] in '''Set''', the [[direct product]] in '''Grp''', or the [[product topology]] in '''Top''', where products exist.

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be objects of a category ''D''. The product of ''X'' and ''Y'' is an object ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' together with two morphisms
:&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''X''
:&amp;pi;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' &amp;rarr; ''Y''
such that for any other object ''Z'' of ''D'' and morphisms ''f'' : ''Z'' → ''X'' and ''g'' : ''Z'' → ''Y'' there exists a unique morphism ''h'' : ''Z'' → ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'' such that ''f'' = π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;∘''h'' and ''g'' = π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;∘''h''.

To understand this characterization as a terminal property we take the category ''C'' to be the [[product category]] ''D'' &amp;times; ''D'' and define the [[diagonal functor]]
:Δ : ''D'' &amp;rarr; ''D'' &amp;times; ''D''
by Δ(''X'') = (''X'', ''X'') and Δ(''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'') = (''f'', ''f''). Then (''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'', (π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) is a terminal morphism from Δ to the object (''X'', ''Y'') of ''D'' &amp;times; ''D'': If (''f'', ''g'') is any morphism from (''Z'', ''Z'') to (''X'', ''Y''), then it must equal a morphism Δ(''h'' : ''Z'' → ''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'') = (''h'', ''h'') from Δ(''Z'') = (''Z'', ''Z'') to Δ(''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'') = (''X'' &amp;times; ''Y'',''X'' &amp;times; ''Y''), followed by (π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Limits and colimits===

Categorical products are a particular kind of [[limit (category theory)|limit]] in category theory. One can generalize the above example to arbitrary limits and colimits.

Let ''J'' and ''C'' be categories with ''J'' a [[small category|small]] [[index category]] and let ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt; be the corresponding [[functor category]]. The ''[[diagonal functor]]''
:Δ : ''C'' → ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt;
is the functor that maps each object ''N'' in ''C'' to the constant functor Δ(''N''): ''J'' → ''C'' to ''N'' (i.e. Δ(''N'')(''X'') = ''N'' for each ''X'' in ''J'').

Given a functor ''F'' : ''J'' → ''C'' (thought of as an object in ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt;), the ''limit'' of ''F'', if it exists, is nothing but a terminal morphism from Δ to ''F''. Dually, the ''colimit'' of ''F'' is an initial morphism from ''F'' to Δ.

==Properties==

===Existence and uniqueness===

Defining a quantity does not guarantee its existence. Given a functor ''U'' and an object ''X'' as above, there may or may not exist an initial morphism from ''X'' to ''U''.  If, however, an initial morphism (''A'', φ) does exist then it is essentially unique. Specifically, it is unique [[up to]] a ''unique'' [[isomorphism]]: if (''A''&amp;prime;, φ&amp;prime;) is another such pair, then there exists a unique isomorphism ''k'': ''A'' → ''A''&amp;prime; such that φ&amp;prime; = ''U''(''k'')φ. This is easily seen by substituting (''A''&amp;prime;, φ&amp;prime;) for (''Y'', ''f'') in the definition of the initial property.

It is the pair (''A'', φ) which is essentially unique in this fashion. The object ''A'' itself is only unique up to isomorphism. Indeed, if (''A'', φ) is an initial morphism and ''k'': ''A'' → ''A''&amp;prime; is any isomorphism then the pair (''A''&amp;prime;, φ&amp;prime;), where φ&amp;prime; = ''U''(''k'')φ, is also an initial morphism.

===Equivalent formulations===

The definition of a universal morphism can be rephrased in a variety of ways. Let ''U'' be a functor from ''D'' to ''C'', and let ''X'' be an object of ''C''. Then the following statements are equivalent:
* (''A'', φ) is an initial morphism from ''X'' to ''U''
* (''A'', φ) is an [[initial object]] of the [[comma category]] (''X'' ↓ ''U'')
* (''A'', φ) is a [[representable functor|representation]] of Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'', ''U''&amp;mdash;)

The dual statements are also equivalent:
* (''A'', φ) is a terminal morphism from ''U'' to ''X''
* (''A'', φ) is a [[terminal object]] of the comma category (''U'' ↓ ''X'')
* (''A'', φ) is a representation of Hom&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''U''&amp;mdash;, ''X'')

===Relation to adjoint functors===

Suppose (''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is an initial morphism from ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''U'' and (''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, φ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an initial morphism from ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ''U''. By the initial property, given any morphism ''h'': ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; there exists a unique morphism ''g'': ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; such that the following diagram commutes:
[[File:UniversalProperty-05.svg|center|200px]]

If ''every'' object ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''C'' admits an initial morphism to ''U'', then the assignment &lt;math&gt;X_i \mapsto A_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h \mapsto g&lt;/math&gt; defines a functor ''V'' from ''C'' to ''D''. The maps φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; then define a [[natural transformation]] from 1&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; (the identity functor on ''C'') to ''UV''. The functors (''V'', ''U'') are then a pair of [[adjoint functor]]s, with ''V'' left-adjoint to ''U'' and ''U'' right-adjoint to ''V''.

Similar statements apply to the dual situation of terminal morphisms from ''U''. If such morphisms exist for every ''X'' in ''C'' one obtains a functor ''V'': ''C'' → ''D'' which is right-adjoint to ''U'' (so ''U'' is left-adjoint to ''V'').

Indeed, all pairs of adjoint functors arise from universal constructions in this manner. Let ''F'' and ''G'' be a pair of adjoint functors with unit η and co-unit ε (see the article on [[adjoint functors]] for the definitions). Then we have a universal morphism for each object in ''C'' and ''D'':
*For each object ''X'' in ''C'', (''F''(''X''), η&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) is an initial morphism from ''X'' to ''G''. That is, for all ''f'': ''X'' → ''G''(''Y'') there exists a unique ''g'': ''F''(''X'') → ''Y'' for which the following diagrams commute.
*For each object ''Y'' in ''D'', (''G''(''Y''), ε&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a terminal morphism from ''F'' to ''Y''. That is, for all ''g'': ''F''(''X'') → ''Y'' there exists a unique ''f'': ''X'' → ''G''(''Y'') for which the following diagrams commute.

[[File:AdjointFunctors2.svg|center|Universal properties of a pair of adjoint functors|300px]]

Universal constructions are more general than adjoint functor pairs: a universal construction is like an optimization problem; it gives rise to an adjoint pair if and only if this problem has a solution for every object of ''C'' (equivalently, every object of ''D'').

== History ==
Universal properties of various topological constructions were presented by [[Pierre Samuel]] in 1948. They were later used extensively by [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]. The closely related concept of adjoint functors was introduced independently by [[Daniel Kan]] in 1958.
